"Amen; with all my heart I say, amen," said Agatha; "but will these poor men resist the soldiers,
Henri?"

"Indeed they will, Agatha."

"But can they? They have not arms, nor practice in the way of fighting--they have no leaders."

"We will take arms from our enemies. We will be apt scholars in fighting for our wives, and
our sisters, and our houses. As for leaders, the man who is most fit shall lead the others."

"And you, Henri--merciful Heaven! what are you about to do--will you take up arms against the
whole republic?"

"With God's blessing I will--against the whole republic."

"May the Lord, in his mercy, look on you and give you his assistance; and as your cause is
just and holy, He will do so. Whatever women can do, we will do; you shall have our prayers
for your success our tears for your reverses, and our praises for your courage; and when you
require it, as some of you will too soon, our tenderest care in your sufferings." At this moment
Marie de Lescure entered the room. "Marie," continued Agatha, you will help to succour those
who are wounded in fighting for their King?"

"Indeed, and indeed I will," said the bright-eyed girl, eagerly, and regret only that I cannot
do more; that I cannot myself be in the battle. But, M. Larochejaquelin, will the people rise?
will there really be fighting? will Charles be there?"

"Indeed he will, Marie; the first among the foremost. Agatha asked me but now, who would be
our leaders? Is there a man in the Bocage--aye, in all Poitou, who will not follow Charles
de Lescure?"

"May the blessed Saviour watch over him and protect him," said Marie, shuddering.

"But tell me, Henri;" said Agatha, "where will it commence--where will they first resist the
troops?"

"I cannot say exactly," said he, "in many places at once I hope. In St. Florent, they say,
not a man will join; in Clisson and Torfou they begin on Monday. Charles, and I, and Adolphe
will be in Clisson. Father Jerome has the whole lists; he says that in St. Laud's, in Echanbroignes,
and Clisson, they are ready, to a man, to oppose the troops: he will go with me to Clisson
on Sunday afternoon; on Monday, with God's will, we will be in the thick of it"

"And will Father Jerome be there, among the soldiers "said Marie.

"Why not," said Henri, "will the peasants fight worse when they see their priest before them?"

"And if he should fall?"

"He will fail in the service of his God and his King; Father Jerome will be here himself tomorrow."

"The Cure of St Laud's," said Agatha, "is not the man to sit idle, when good work is to be
done, but, oh! what awful times are these, when the priests themselves have to go out to fight
for their altars and their crucifix."

"I will return home with you, M Larochejaquelin, when you go to Clisson," said Marie.

"And leave Agatha alone?" said Henri

"Don't mind me, Henri," said Agatha, "I shall be well here. Marie cannot leave Madame de Lescure
alone, when her husband is, away and in such danger."

"You will soon have company here enough," said Henri. "De Lescure, and I, and Adolphe, and
Heaven knows whom besides. Charette will be in arms, and d'Autachamps, the Prince de Talmont,
and M. Bonchamps. At present their business is at a distance from us; but we shall probably
be all brought together sooner or later, and they will all be welcome at Durbelliere."

"They shall be welcome if they are friends of yours, and friends of the King; but come, Marie,
it is late, let us go to bed; next week, perhaps, we shall be wanting rest, and unable to take it."

They met the next morning at breakfast, and the old Marquis was there also, and the priest,
to whom they had alluded in their conversation on the preceding evening--Father Jerome, the
Cure of St. Laud's--such at least had he been, and so was he still called, though his parish
had been taken away from him, and his place filled by a constitutional pastor; that is, by
a priest who had taken the oath to the Constitution, required by the National Assembly Father
Jerome was banished from his church, and deprived of the small emoluments of his office; but
he was not silenced, for he still continued to perform the ceremonies of his religion, sometimes
in some gentleman's drawing-room, sometimes in a farmer's house, or a peasant's cottage, but
oftener out in the open air, under the shadow of a spreading beech, on a rude altar hastily
built for him with rocks and stones.

The church of St Laud's was perfectly deserted--not a single person would attend there to hear
mass said by the strange priest--the peasants would as soon have been present at some infernal
rite, avowedly celebrated in honour of the devil--and yet the Cure newly sent there was not
a bad man But he was a constitutional priest, and that was enough to recommend him to the ill-will
of the peasantry In peaceable and happy times, prior to the revolution, the Cure of St Laud's
had been a remarkable person, he was a man of more activity, both of mind and body, than his
brethren, he was more intimate with the gentry than the generality of clergymen in the neighbourhood,
and at the same time more actively engaged in promoting the welfare of the poor. The country
cures generally were men who knew little of the world and its ways--who were uneducated, save
as regards their own profession--who had few ideas beyond their own duties and station, This
was not so with Father Jerome; he had travelled and heard the ways of men in other countries;
he had not read much but he had seen a good deal, and he was a man of quick apprehension--and
above all a man of much energy. He had expressed great hostility to the revolution since its
commencement; at a time when so few were hostile to it, he had foreseen that it would destroy
the religion and the religious feeling of the country, and he had constantly besought his flock
to remain true to their old customs. He was certainly a devout man in his own way, though he
was somewhat unscrupulous in his devotions; the people were as superstitious as they were faithful,
and he never hesitated in using their superstition to forward his own views. His whole anxiety
was for their welfare; but he cherished their very faults, their ignorance and their follies,
to enable himself to serve them in his own manner. He was unwilling that they should receive
other education than that which they now had--he was jealous of any one's interfering with
them but their landlord and himself. He would not own that any change: could better their condition,
or that anything more was desirable for them than that they should live contented and obedient,
and die faithful in hope.

Durbelliere had not been in his parish, but he had always been peculiarly intimate with the
family of the Larochejaquelins, and had warmly welcomed the return of Henri to the Bocage,
at a time when so many of the nobility were leaving the country. They were now about to join
hand and heart in saving the people from the horrors of the conscription, and though the Cure's
nominal mission was to be purely spiritual, he was quite prepared to give temporal aid to his
allies, should it at any time appear expedient to himself to do so.

Father Jerome was a tall, well-made, brawny man; his face was not exactly handsome, but it
was bold and intellectual; his eye was bright and clear, and his forehead high and open--he
was a man of immense muscular power and capable of great physical exertion--he was above forty-five
years of age but still apparently in the prime of his strength. He wore a long rusty black,
or rather grey cure's frock, which fell from his shoulders down to his heels, and was fastened
round his body with a black belt--this garment was much the worse for wear, for Father Jerome
had now been deprived of his income for some twelve months; but he was no whit ashamed of his
threadbare coat, he rather gloried in it, and could not be induced by the liberal offers of
his more wealthy friends to lay it aside.

Father Jerome greeted them all as he entered the breakfast-room. He was received with great
kindness by the old Marquis, who pressed his hand and made him sit beside himself; he blessed
the two young girls fervently, and nodded affectionately to Henri, whom he had seen on the
preceding day. It was evident that the Cure of St. Laud's was quite at home at Durbelliere.

"We have awful times coming on us now, Father Jerome," said Agatha.

"Not so, Mademoiselle," said the priest, "we have good times coming, we will have a King and
our Church again, we poor cure will have our homes and our altars again; our own parishes and
our old flocks."

"Come what, come may," said Henri, "we cannot be worse than the Convention would make us."

"But we firmly trust that by God's will and with God's aid, we will soon be rid of all our
troubles," said the priest. "M le Marquis, we have your best wishes, I know; and your full
approval. I hope we shall soon be able to lay our trophies at your feet."

"The approval of an old man like me is but of little avail; but you shall have my prayers.
I would, however, that God had spared me from these days; it is grievous for me to see my son
going out to fight against his own countrymen, at his own door-sill; it would be more grievous
still, where he now to hesitate in doing so."

"No true son of Poitou hesitates now," said the enthusiastic priest. "I yesterday saw every
conscript in the parish of St. Laud's, and not a single man hesitated--not one dreams of joining
the republicans; and, moreover, there is not an able-bodied man who will not come forward to
assist the conscripts in withstanding the soldiers; the women, too, Mademoiselle, are equally
eager. Barere will find it difficult, I think, to raise a troop from Poitou."

"Will the conscripts from hence be required to join at Chatillon or at Cholet?" said the old man.

"Those from St. Laud's, at Chatillon," said Henri; "but the men will not leave their homes,
they will know how to receive the soldiers if they come amongst them."

So saying, he got up and went out, and the priest followed him; they had much to do, and many
things to arrange; to distribute arms and gunpowder, and make the most of their little means.
It was not their present intention to lead the men from their homes, but they wished to prepare
them to receive the republican troops, when they came into the country to enforce the collection
of the republican levy.

CHAPTER IV

CATHELINEAU

The revolt of St. Florent took place on the day after that on which the priest had breakfasted
at Durbelliere, and the rumours of it went quickly through the country. As Cathelineau had
said, the news was soon known in Nantes and Angers, and the commander of the republican troops
determined most thoroughly to avenge the insolence and rebellion of the vain people of St.
Florent. He was not, however, able to accomplish his threat on the instant, for he also was
collecting conscripts in the neighbourhood of Nantes, and the peasantry had heard of the doings
of St. Florent as well as the soldiers, and the men of Brittany seemed inclined to follow the
example of the men of Anjou.

He had, therefore, for a time enough to occupy his own troops, without destroying the rebels
of St. Florent--and it was well for St. Florent that it was so. Had he at once marched five
hundred men, with four pieces of cannon against the town, he might have reduced the place to
ashes, and taken a bloody revenge for their victory The men of St Florent would have had no
means of opposing such a force, and the peasantry generally were not armed, the tactics of
the royalists were not settled, and the revolt through the province was not general. The destruction
of St Florent was postponed for a month, and at the expiration of that time, the troops of
the republic had too much to do, to return to the little town where the war had commenced.

The rumour of what had been done at St. Florent, was also soon known in Coron, in Torfou, and
in Clisson. The battle was fought on Thursday, and early on Saturday morning, M. de Lescure
had heard some indistinct rumour of the occurrence; indistinct at least it seemed to him, for
he could not believe that the success of the townspeople was so complete, as it was represented
to him to be; he heard at the same time that the revolt had been headed by Cathelineau and
Foret, and that as soon as the battle was over, they had started for Durbelliere to engage
the assistance of Henri Larochejaquelin. De Lescure, therefore, determined to go at once to
Durbelliere; and Adolphe Denot, who was with him, accompanied him.

They found Henri in the midst of his preparations, weighing out gunpowder with the assistance
of the priest and the two girls. There was a large quarry on the Marquis' estate, and a considerable
supply of gunpowder for blasting had been lately brought to Durbelliere from Nantes, as it
could not be purchased in the neighbouring towns. As the priest remarked, blasting powder was
not the best, but it was good enough to treat republicans with--at any rate they could get
no better, and it was lucky that they chanced to have that.

Charles de Lescure shuddered, as he. saw the dangerous employment on which his sister was engaged;
but Henri's sister was doing the same thing, and he knew that dangerous times for all of them
were coming. Adolphe was disgusted that Agatha's white hands should be employed in so vile
a service, but he thought ittle of the danger to which she was exposed.

"You are well employed, ladies," said de Lescure, "but not an hour too soon. I am rejoiced
to see you so well supplied, Henri; this is indeed a Godsend. Father Jerome, is this strictly
canonical; gunpowder I fear is altogether a temporal affair".

"But rebellion and hell-fire are synonomous," said the priest, "and loyalty is the road to
Paradise. I am strictly within my calling, M. de Lescure. Mademoiselle, these packets are too
large. You are giving too good measure. Remember how many are the claimants for our bounty."

"You have, of course, all heard what occurred at St. Florent the day before yesterday," said
de Lescure.

"Not a word," said Henri. "What happened there? we hear nothing here till a week after it is
known in the towns."

They all left off what they were doing, and listened anxiously for M. de Lescure's tidings.
"Good news, I trust," said the Cure, whose face showed a fearful degree of anxiety. "Good news,
I trust in God; the men of St. Florent, I am sure, have not disgraced themselves."

"Indeed, they have not, Father Jerome. If. the half of what I hear be true, they have already
played a grand part. What I hear is this--not a conscript was to be seen at the barracks when
they were summoned. Three or four soldiers were sent to commence the collection in the town,
and they were at once taken prisoners by a party headed by Cathelineau, the postillion. The
Colonel then turned out, and fired on the crowd; but he could not stand his ground before the
people, who drove him back to the barracks; half his men were killed in retreating. The people
then attacked the barracks, and regularly carried them by storm; took the cannon which was
with the detachment, and made prisoners of every soldier that was not killed in the fray. If
the half of it be true, St. Florent has made a fine beginning for us."

"Glorious fellows!" said Adolphe. "What would I not give to have been with them?"

"You will have plenty of opportunity, M. Denot," said the priest, who held Adolphe in great
aversion.

"But, Charles, the carnage of the people must have been dreadful," said Henri; "they had nothing
but their hands and nails to fight with, against the muskets and bayonets of the soldiers--against
artillery even."

"The Lord supplied them with weapons, my son," said the priest, solemnly. "Cannot He, who has
given them courage and good hearts to stand against the enemies of their country, also give
them weapons to fight his battles?"

"They say, too, that by some miracle the cannon could not be got to fire on the town.  They
say it was loaded and ready, but that the powder would not ignite when the torch was put to
it," said de Lescure.

"They say," added Denot, "that the Colonel himself repeatedly tried to fire it, but could not;
and that when he found that Providence, interfered for the people, he laid down his sword,
and gave himself up."

"The man who came to me from the town," continued de Lescure, "had a thousand wonderful stories.
He says, that twenty times in the day Cathelineau stood, unharmed before the bayonets of the
soldiers; that twenty times he was shot at, but it was impossible to wound him. They say that
God has interfered for the protection of St. Florent."

"Most probable," said the priest, "most probable; for who, my children, shall attempt to judge
the ways of God? Why should He not put out his right hand to assist his own?"

"And were there not many of the townspeople killed?" asked Agatha.

"We did not hear," replied de Lescure; "but the news of their triumph would travel faster than
the account of their misfortunes; there could not but have been much bloodshed."

"After all," said Henri, "we do not know how much of this is true. We must not believe it all;
it is too glorious to be true."

"Do not say so, M. Larochejaquelin," said the priest, "do not say so; we will do greater things
than that with the assistance of God and the blessed Virgin; but we will not envy the men of
St. Florent the honour they have won."

"You believe it all, then, Father Jerome," said Marie. "You believe that the republicans have
been beaten."

"Every word, Mademoiselle, every word religiously. I should be a heathen else, or worse than
that, a republican."

The group who were discussing the probability of the victory said to have been gained at St.
Florent, were standing at the window of one of the front rooms of the chateau, which looked
immediately on one of the whitewashed recumbent lions, and from it they could see the wooden
gates, the lodge, and the paved road which ran from Chatillon to Vihiers in front of the chateau.
As the priest finished speaking, three men rode through the gates, into the avenue, directly
up to the house-door: one was tolerably well mounted on a large horse, the second was on a
shaggy pony, and the third, who was rather behind the others, was seated on a mule of most
unprepossessing appearance, whose sides he did not for a moment cease to lacerate with his
heels, to enable himself to keep up with his companions.

"That is Foret, from St. Florent himself!" shouted the priest, rushing out towards the door,
as soon as he saw the first horseman turn in at the gate; "a good man, and true as any living,
and one who hates a skulking republican as he does the devil."

"And that is the postillion himself, on the pony!" shouted Henri, running after him. "I could
swear to him, by his hat, among a thousand."

"Who is the man on the mule, Adolphe?" said de Lescure, remaining at the window. "By the bye,"
he added, turning to the two girls who remained with him, and who were trembling in every joint,
at they knew not what, "I forgot, in my hurry, or rather I hadn't time as yet to tell Henri
that I had heard that these men were coming here."

"Are those the very men who gained the victory at St. Florent?" asked Marie.

"So we heard," replied de Lescure, "and now, and not till now, I believe it; their coming here
is strong confirmation; the Cure is right, it seems."

"And is that man the good postillion of whom the people talk?"

"He is--at least he is no longer a postillion. He will cease to be a postillion now; from henceforth
he will be only a soldier."

The Cure and Larochejaquelin had rushed down the steps, and seized the hands of Foret and Cathelineau,
as they got off their horses. It was soon evident to them that the noise of their deeds had
gone before them. Foret at once returned the greeting of Father Jerome, for they had long known
each other, and the difference between their stations was not so very great; but Cathelineau
hardly knew how to accept, or how to refuse, the unwonted mark of friendship shewn him by a
wealthy seigneur; it had not been his lot to shake hands with gentlemen, and he had no wish
to step beyond his proper sphere, because he had been put prominently forward in the affair
of St. Florent; but he had no help for it; before he knew where he was, Larochejaquelin had
got him by the hand, and was dragging him into the salon of Durbelliere. It appeared to the
postillion that the room was full; there were ladies there too--young, beautiful, and modest--such
as he was in the habit of seeing through the windows of the carriages which he drove; the old
Marquis was there too now; the butler had just wheeled in his chair, and Cathelineau perceived
that he was expected to join the group at once. A vista was opened for him up to the old man's
chair; his eyes swam, and he hardly recollected the faces of the different people round him.
He wished that he had waited at the gate, and sent in for M. Henri; he could have talked to
him alone. Why had he ridden up so boldly to the chateau gate? He had never trembled, for a
moment, during the hot work at St. Florent, but now he felt that circumstances could almost
make him a coward.

On a sudden he remembered that his hat was still on his head, and he snatched his hand out
of Henri's to remove it, and then, when it was off, he wanted to go back to the hall to put
it down.

Henri saw his confusion, and, taking it from him, put it on a chair, and then they all shook
hands with him. He first found his hand in that of the Marquis, and heard the old man bless
him, and then the Priest blessed him, and then he felt the soft, sweet hands of those bright
angels within his own horny palm; he heard them speaking to him, though he knew not what they
said; and then he could restrain himself no longer, for tears forced themselves into his eyes,
and, in the midst of them all, he cried like a child.

There was infection in his tears, for Agatha and Marie, when they saw them, cried too, and
the eyes of some of the men also were not dry; they all knew what the feelings of the man were,
and they fully sympathised with him. It was strange how little they said about St. Florent
at first; the moment the men had been seen, they were most anxious for the tidings of what
had been done; but now they all seemed satisfied as to the truth of what they had heard--there
was no longer any doubt. The heroes of St. Florent were there, and, though neither of them
had yet spoken a word about the battle which had been fought, the presence of the victors was
sufficient evidence of the victory.

The Cure, however, and M. de Lescure soon took Foret apart, and learnt from him the details
of what had been done, while the father and son, and the two girls, endeavoured to put the
postillion at his ease in his new position.

Cathelineau was a very good-looking man, about thirty-five years of age; his hair was very
dark, and curled in short, thick clusters; his whiskers were large and bushy, and met beneath
his face; his upper lip was short, his mouth was beautifully formed, and there was a deep dimple
on his chin; but the charm of his face was in the soft benignant expression of his eyes; he
looked as though he loved his fellow-creatures--he looked as though he could not hear, unmoved,
a tale of woe or oppression--of injuries inflicted on the weak, or of unfair advantages assumed
by the strong. It was this which had made him so much beloved; and it was not only the expression
of his countenance, but of his heart also.

"And were you not wounded, Cathelineau?" asked the old gentleman.

"No, M. le Marquis, thank God! I was not."

"Nor Foret?"

"No, M. le Marquis."

"But were there many wounded?" said Agatha.

"Ah! Mademoiselle, there were--many, very many!"

"I knew there must have been," said Marie, shuddering.

"We cannot have war without the horrors of war," said Henri. "It is better, is it not, Cathelineau,
that some of us should fall, than that all of us should be slaves?"

"A thousand times, M. Larochejaquelin ten thousand times!" said he, with a return of that determined
vigour with which he had addressed his fellow-townsmen the day before.

"Yes, you are right, ten thousand times better! and, Marie, you would not be your brother's
sister if you did not think so," said Henri; "but you do think so, and so does Agatha, though
she cries so fast."

"I am not crying, Henri," said Agatha, removing her handkerchief from her eyes, which belied
her assertion; "but one cannot but think of all the misery which is coming on us: were there--were
there any women wounded in the battle?"

There were, Mademoiselle; but those who were so, never complained; and those who were killed
will never have need to complain again."

"Were there women killed?"

"There were two, Mademoiselle; one a young girl; the other has left children to avenge her death."

"That is the worst of all," said Henri, shuddering. "Cathelineau, we must keep the women in
the houses; our men will not fight if they see their wives and sweethearts bleeding beside
them; such a sight would make me throw my sword away myself."

"It would make you throw away the scabbard, M. Larochejaquelin; but I fear we shall see enough
of such sights," and then he blushed deeply, as he reflected that what he had said would frighten
the fair girls sitting near him; "but I beg pardon, ladies--I--"

"Don't mind us, Cathelineau," said Agatha; "you will not frighten us; our brothers will fight
by your side; and you will find that we are worthy of our brothers. Marie and I will take our
chance without repining."

"And what is to come next, Cathelineau?" said Henri; "we have thrown down the gauntlet now,
and we must be ready for all the consequences. You see, we were preparing for the same work,"
and he pointed to the open packets of gunpowder which were lying scattered on the table. In no attitude

 But think what it would
be in our favour; it commands the Loire, it commands the road from Paris, besides, it contains
what we so much want, arms, ammunition, and artillery; it is from Saumur that the republican
troops are supplied with gunpowder; believe me, Saumur should be our mark. I know it is difficult,
there will be danger and difficulties enough, I know; but it is not impossible, and I believe
it may be done," and then he looked round, and saw where he was, and that every one in the
room was listening to him, and he added, "but I am too bold to say so much before my Lord the
Marquis, and M. Larochejaquelin, and M. de Lescure, and the other gentlemen, whose opinions
are so much better than my own."

"He is right, Henri," said de Lescure; "take my word, he is right. We will do it, my friend,"
and he put his hand on the postillion's shoulder. "We will be masters of Saumur, and you shall
lead us there; we will help you to plant the King's standard on the citadel of the town."

Cathelineau was still sitting, and he looked up into de Lescure's face with thankful admiration.
"Ah! M. de Lescure, with such guides as you, with such a heart, such courage as yours, no walls
shall hinder us, no enemies prevent us."

"You shall have many such friends, Cathelineau," said he; "many as eager, and very many more
useful."

"None more useful," said the postillion; "none could be more useful."

"No; none more useful," said the Marquis; "may you have many friends as good, and then you
will succeed."

"Saumur let it be, then," said Henri. "I have no doubt you are right; and indeed I do not claim
to be great in council; I only hope I may not be found backward in action."

"That you never, never will," said Agatha. "That he never will, Mademoiselle: a Larochejaquelin
was never backward in the hour of need," said Cathelineau.

"They know how to flatter in St. Florent, my friend," said she smiling.

"If that be flattery, all the country flatters. I only speak as I hear others speaking; they
say that beauty and courage were always to be found at Durbelliere."

"Nay, Agatha; but is he not Bayard complete?" said Marie laughing. "I am sure we should be
obliged; it is an age since we received a compliment here in the Bocage."

"The ladies are laughing at me," said Cathelineau, rising, "and it is time that I and my friend
should cease to trouble you."

"But where would you go, Cathelineau?" said Henri.

"Back to St. Florent; we have gained our object; we can tell our townsmen that the gentlemen
of Poitou will fight on their side."

"We will tell them so together, tomorrow by sunset," said Henri; "it is now late, you and Foret
stay here tonight; not a word either of you, for your life. I command this garrison; do not
you, Cathelineau, be the first to shew an example of disobedience. Father Jerome, lay hands
on Foret, lest he fly. Why, my friend, have we so much time to spare, that we can afford to
lose it in foolish ceremony? Have we not a thousand plans to mature--a thousand things to settle,
which we must settle, and none but we, and which we must discuss together? Are there not here
four, six of us, brothers in arms together? I count you one, Father Jerome; and are we not
here with the benefit of our father's advice? When shall we all meet again, or when could we
meet that our meeting would be more desirable? Well, go if you will, Cathelineau," added he,
seeing that the postillion hesitated; "but every one here will tell you that you are wrong
to do so."

"Stay, my friend," said the Marquis, who understood well the different feelings which perplexed
the mind of the postillion; "stay, my friend, and take your supper with us; you have undertaken
a great work, and have shewn yourself fit for it, do not let little things embarrass you. Agatha,
darling, see that beds be got ready for our friends. Father Jerome also will remain here tonight,
and Charles, and Adolphe; we may not have many merry suppers more, we will at any rate enjoy
tonight."

"And Cathelineau," said Henri, "you will not, I trust, be less welcome in St. Florent tomorrow
because I accompany you."

It was then decided that they should all remain there that night, that de Lescure and Adolphe
should return with Marie to Clisson on the following morning, and that Henri and the priest
should accompany Foret and the postillion to St. Florent, there to make the best arrangement
within their power for the immediate protection of the place.

They were not very merry that evening, but they were by no means unhappy; as Henri had said
they had much to talk of, and they spent an anxious evening, but each satisfied the other.
Cathelineau felt himself to be in a new world, sitting down at table to eat with such companions
as those around him. The sweet, kind face of Agatha disturbed him most. It almost unmanned
him; he thought that it would be happiness enough for a life to be allowed to remain unseen
where he might gaze on her. He felt that such beauty, such ineffable loveliness as hers could
almost make him forget his country and his countrymen; and then he shuddered and turned his
eyes away from her. But there she sat close to him: and she would speak to him, and ask him
questions; she asked after his friends in St. Florent, after the women who were wounded, and
she gave him money for the children who were made orphans; and then her hand touched his again,
and he thought that he was asleep and dreaming.

Much of importance to their future plans was arranged that night, and such a council of war
was probably never before assembled. The old man joined in their contemplated designs with
as much energy as the youngest among them; the words rash and imprudent never once crossed
his lips; nothing seemed rash to him that was to be undertaken for the restoration of the King.
The priest took a very prominent part in it, and his word was certainly not for peace; he was
the most urgent of the party for decided measures. De Lescure, Larochejaquelin, and Denot,
argued, debated, and considered, as though war had always been their profession; but they all
submitted, or were willing to submit, to Cathelineau; he had already commenced the war, and
had been successful; he had already shewn the ready wit to contrive, and the bold hand to execute;
his fitness to lead was acknowledged, and though two days since he was only a postillion, he
was tacitly acknowledged by this little band of royalists, to be their leader.

And there too among these confederates sat Agatha and Marie, if not talking themselves, yet
listening with almost breathless attention to the plans of the party; sharing their anxiety,
promising their women's aid, enchanting them with their smiles, or encouraging them with their
tears. Cathelineau had heard how knights of old, famed in song, had spent their lives among
scenes of battle and danger, and all for the smiles of the lady of their love; and now he thought
he understood it. He could do the same to be greeted with the smiles of Agatha Larochejaquelin,
and he would not dream of any richer reward. She was as an angel to him, who had left her own
bright place in heaven to illuminate the holy cause in which he had now engaged himself; under
such protection he could not be other than successful.

When Foret and Cathelineau dismounted, and were taken into the house by Henri and the Cure,
they left their steeds in the care of Peter Berrier; but Peter has not been left ever since
leading them up and down in sight of the white-washed lions. The revolt of St. Florent had
been heard of in the servants' hall as well as in the salon upstairs, and it was soon known
that the heroes of the revolt were in the house, and that their horses were before the door.
A couple of men and two or three boys soon hurried round, and Peter was relieved from his charge,
and courteously led into the servants' hall by Momont, the grey-headed old butler and favourite
servant of the Marquis, and Jacques Chapeau, the valet, groom, and confidential factotum of
Larochejaquelin. Peter was soon encouraged to tell his tale, and to explain the mission which
had brought him and his two companions to Durbelliere, and under ordinary circumstances the
having to tell so good a tale would have been a great joy to him; but at the present moment
Peter was not quite satisfied with his own position; why was the postillion in the salon while
he was in the kitchen? Peter usually was a modest man enough, and respectful to his superiors;
the kitchen table in a nobleman's house would generally be an elysium to him; he had no idea
that he was good enough to consort with Marquises and their daughters; but he did think himself
equal to Cathelineau, the postillion, and as Cathelineau was in the salon, why should he be
in the kitchen? He quite understood that Cathelineau was thus welcomed, thus raised from his
ordinary position in consequence of what he had done at St. Florent, but why shouldn't he,
Berrier, be welcomed, and raised also? He couldn't see that Cathelineau had done more than
he had himself. He was the first man to resist; he had been the first hero, and yet he was
left for half an hour to lead about a horse, an ass, and an old mule, as though he were still
the ostler at an auberge, and then he was merely taken into the servants' hall, and asked to
eat cold meat, while Cathelineau was brought into a grand room upstairs to talk to lords and
ladies; this made Peter fidgety and uncomfortable; and when he heard, moreover, that Cathelineau
was to sup upstairs at the same table with the Marquis and the ladies, all his pleasure in
the revolt was destroyed, he had no taste for the wine before him, and he wished in his heart
that he had joined the troops, and become a good republican. He could not bear the aristocratic
foppery of that Cathelineau.

"And were you a conscript yourself, Peter Berrier?" said Jacques Chapeau.

"Of course I was," said Peter. "Why, haven't you heard what the revolt of St. Florent was about?"

"Well; we have heard something about it," said Momont; "but we didn't exactly hear your name
mentioned."

"You couldn't have heard much of the truth then," said Berrier.

"We heard," said Chapeau, "how good Cathelineau began by taking three soldiers prisoners."

"I had twice more to do with those three prisoners than ever he had," said Peter.

"Well; we never heard that," said Momont.

"But we heard," said Chapeau, "how Cathelineau led a few of the townsmen against a whole regiment
of soldiers, and scattered them through the town like chaff."

"Scattered them like chaff!" said Peter.

"And we heard," said Momont, "how he stormed the barracks, slaughtered all the soldiers, and
dragged the Colonel with his own hand through the barrack window."

"Through the barrack window!" repeated Peter, with an air intended to throw discredit on the
whole story.

"And we heard," said Gather's confidential maid, "how he laid his hand upon the cannon and
charmed it, so that it would not go off, though the fiery torch was absolutely laid upon the
gunpowder."

"That the cannon wouldn't go off though the torch was laid upon the gunpowder!" said Peter.

"And we heard," said the cook, "how all the girls in the town came and crowned him with bay
leaves; and how the priest blessed him."

"And how the young made him their captain and their general," said the housekeeper.

"And how they christened him the Saviour of St. Florent," said the laundress.

"And gave him all the money in the town, and the biggest sword they could find," said the page.

"You heard all this, did you?" said Peter Berrier.

"Indeed we did" said Jacques Chapeau, "and a great deal more from M. de Lescure's own man,
who went back to Clisson only an hour since, and who had it all from one who came direct from
St. Florent."

"And you heard not a word of Peter Berrier?"

"Not a word, not a word," said they all at once.

"Then, friends, let me tell you, you have not heard much of the truth, although M. de Lescure's
own man did see the man who came direct from St. Florent; I think I may say, without boasting,
and I believe Monsieur the postillion upstairs will not be inclined to contradict me, that
without me, there would have been no revolt.

"No revolt without you? No revolt without Peter Berrier? No revolt without M. Debedin's ostler?"
said they one after another.

"No--no revolt without M. Debedin's ostler, Madame." The last question had been asked by the
cook. "M. Debedin's ostler is as good, I suppose, as M. Gaspardieu's postillion."

"What, as good as Cathelineau?" asked Momont.

"As good as our good postillion!" shouted Chapeau.

"As good as the holy man who charmed the cannon!" said the confidential maid in a tone of angry
amazement.

"Would all the girls in St. Florent crown you with bay leaves!" jeered the cook.

"Will they ever make you a great captain!" screamed the housekeeper.

"Or call you the Saviour of St. Florent!" added the laundress.

"Or trust you with all the money, I'd like to know!" suggested the page.

Peter Berrier felt that he was ill-used after all that he had gone through for his King and
his country; he sat apart for the rest of the evening, and meditated whether he would go over
to the republicans, and bring an army down upon Durbelliere, or whether he would more nobly
revenge himself by turning out a more enterprising royalist than even the postillion himself.

CHAPTER V

DE LESCURE.

De Lescure with his sister returned on the following morning to Clisson; for so was his chateau
called. Clisson is about two leagues south of the town of Brassiere, in the province of Poitou,
and is situated in the southern part of the Bocage. M. de Lescure owned the chateau and a considerable
territory around it. He was a man of large property in that country where the properties were
all comparatively small, and was in other respects also by far the most influential person
in the neighbourhood. He had married a lady with a large fortune, which gave him more means
of assisting the poor than most of the gentlemen resident in the Bocage possessed. He took
a deep interest in the welfare of those around him; he shared their joys, and sympathized with
their grief, and he was consequently beloved, and almost adored.

He had now undertaken to join with his whole heart the insurgents against the Republic, and
he was fully determined to do so; he had made up his mind that it was his duty to oppose measures
which he thought destructive to the happiness of his countrymen, and to make an effort to re-establish
the throne; but he did not bring to the work the sanguine hope of success, the absolute pleasure
in the task which animated Larochejaquelin; nor yet the sacred enthusiastic chivalry of Cathelineau,
who was firmly convinced of the truth of his cause, and believed that the justice of God would
not allow the murderers of a King, and the blasphemers of his name to prevail against the arms
of people who were both loyal and faithful.

De Lescure had studied and thought much; he was older than Larochejaquelin, much better educated
than Cathelineau. He was as ardent in the cause as they were; why else had he undertaken it?
but he understood better than they did the fearful chances which were against them: the odds
against which they had to fight, the almost insuperable difficulties in their way. He knew
that the peasantry around them would be brave and enthusiastic followers, but he also knew
that it would be long before they were disciplined soldiers. He was sure that they would fight
stoutly round their homes and their families; but he felt that it would be almost impossible
to lead any body of them to a distance from their own fields. He foresaw also all the horrors
into which they were about to plunge; horrors, of which an honourable death on the field of
battle would be the least. The Republic had already shown the bitterness of their malice towards
those who opposed them, and de Lescure knew what mercy it would shew to those of his party
who fell into its power.

Besides, how could they hope for success against the arms of a whole nation supported by a
despotic government. His friends talked sanguinely of aid from England, from Austria, and from
Prussia; but he feared that that aid would come too late, after their houses were burnt, and
their fields destroyed; after the best among them had fallen; after their children had been
murdered; when the country should be depopulated, and nothing but the name of La Vendee left.

With all these fears around his heart, and yet with a firm determination to give himself entirely
to the cause in which he was embarked, de Lescure rode home to tell his young wife, to whom
he was but barely two years married, that he must not only leave her, and give up the life
so congenial to both their tastes, which they had lately led; but that he was going to place
himself in constant danger, and leave her and all he loved in danger also.

"You must be very good to Victoriana," he said to his sister; "you must be very good to each
other, Marie, for you will both have much to bear."

"We will, we will," said Marie; "but you, Charles, you will be with us; at any rate not far
from us."

"I may be near you, and yet not with you; or I may soon be placed beyond all human troubles.
I would have you prepare yourself; of all the curses which can fall on a country, a civil war
is the most cruel."

Madame de Lescure was the daughter of a nobleman of high rank; she had been celebrated as a
beauty, and known to possess a great fortune; she had been feted and caressed in the world,
but she had not been spoiled; she was possessed of much quiet sense; and though she was a woman
of strong passions, she kept them under control. When her husband told her, therefore, that
the quiet morning of their life was over, that they had now to wade through contest, bloodshed,
and civil war, and that probably all their earthly bliss would be brought to a violent end
before the country was again quiet, she neither screamed nor fainted; but she felt, what he
intended that she should feel that she must, now, more entirely than ever, look for her happiness
in some world beyond the present one.

"I know, Victorine," said he, when they were alone together in the evening, when not even his
own dear sister Marie was there to mar the sacred sweetness of their conference, "I know that
I am doing right, and that gives me strength to leave you, and our darling child. I know that
I am about to do my duty; and you would not wish that I should remain here in safety, when
my King and my country require my services."

"No, Charles; I would never wish that you should be disgraced in your own estimation. I could
perfectly disregard what all others said of you, as long as you were satisfied with your own
conduct; but I would not for any worldly happiness, that you should live a coward in your own
esteem."

"My own, own Victorine," said he, "how right you are! What true happiness could we have ever
had, if we attempted to enjoy it at the expense of our countrymen! Every man owes his life
to his country; in happy, quiet times, that debt is best paid by the performance of homely
quiet duties; but our great Father has not intended that lot for us."

"His will be done. He may yet turn away from us this misery. We may yet live, Charles, to look
on these things as our dearest reminiscences."

"We may; but it is not the chance for which we should be best prepared. We are not to expect
that God will raise his arm especially to vindicate our injuries; it would be all but blasphemous
to ask Him to do so. We are but a link in the chain of events which His wisdom has designed.
Should we wish that that chain should be broken for our purposes?"

"Surely not. I would not be so presumptuous as to name my own wishes in my prayers to the Creator."

"No; leave it to His wisdom to arrange our weal or woe in this world; satisfied with this,
that He has promised us happiness in the world which is to come."

"I must leave you on Monday, dearest," continued he, after a pause, during which he sat with
his wife's hand within his own.

"So soon, Charles!"

"Yes, dearest, on Monday. Henri, and Adolphe, and others, will be here on Sunday; and our different
duties will commence immediately."

"And will yours keep you altogether away from Clisson?"

"Very nearly so; at any rate, I could not name the day or the week, when I might be with you.
You and Marie will be all in all to each other now; do not let her droop and grow sad, Victorine."

"Nay, Charles, it is she should comfort me; she loves no dear husband. Marie dotes on you;
but she can never feel for a brother, as I must feel for you."

"She is younger than you, Victorine, and has not your strength of mind."

"She has fewer cares to trouble her; but we will help each other; it will be much to me to
have her with me in your absence. I know she is giving up much in returning to Clisson, and
she does it solely for my sake."

"How! what is she giving up? Will she not be better in her own home than elsewhere in such
times as these."

"She might choose to change her home, Charles; I had a happy, happy home, but I should not
have been contented to remain there till now. I found that something more than my own old home
was necessary to my happiness."

"You have made but a sad exchange, my love."

"Would I for all the world recall what I have done? Have I ever repented? Shall I ever repent?
No; not though your body were brought breathless to your own hall door, would I exchange my
right to mourn over it, for the lot of the happiest bride just stepping from the altar in all
the pride of loveliness and rank?"

"My own true love. But tell me, what is this you mean about Marie. Surely she is not betrothed
without my knowledge."

"Betrothed! Oh, no! Nor won, nor wooed, as far as I believe; but we women, Charles, see through
each other's little secrets. I think she is not indifferent to Henri Larochejaquelin; and how
should she be! How few she sees from whom to choose; and if all France were before her feet,
how could she make a better choice than him."

"Poor Marie, from my heart I pity her; in any other times than these, how I would have gloried
to have given Henri my sister; but now, these are no times to marry, or to give in marriage.
Henri has stern, hard work to do, and he is bent on doing it; ay, and he will do it. No one
will carry the standard of his King further into the ranks of the republicans than Henri Larochejaquelin."

"I know one, Charles, who will, at any rate, be beside him."

"But he is so full of glorious confidence--so certain of success. He will go to battle with
the assured hope of victory. I shall fight expecting nothing but defeat."

"You are melancholy, tonight, my love: something ails you beyond your dread of the coming struggle."

"Can I be other than melancholy? I have no hope."

"No hope, Charles. Oh! do not say you have no hope."

"None in this world, Victorine. The Indian widow, when she throws herself on the burning pile,
with a noble courage does what she has been taught to look upon as a sacred duty, but she cannot
but dread the fire which is to consume her."

"You would not liken yourself to her?"

"Through the mercy of our blessed Saviour I am not so mistaken in my creed; but I am hardly
less calamitous in my fate: but it is not the prospect of my own sufferings which disturb me;
I at any rate may be assured of an honourable, even an enviable death. It is my anxiety for
you--for our little one--and for dear Marie, which makes my spirit sad."

"God will temper the wind to the shorn lamb," said Madame de Lescure. "Our trials will not
be harder than we can bear."

"God bless you for those words, dearest: there is comfort in them--real, true comfort. But
remember them yourself Victorine; remember them when you will most want them. When great sorrow
comes home to your bosom, as it will do; when affliction is heavy on you, when worldly comforts
are leaving you, when enemies are around you, when the voices of cruel men are in your ears,
and their cruel deeds before your eyes, then remember, my love, that God will temper the wind
to the shorn lamb."

"I will, my own Charles, I will," said she, now kneeling at his feet, and burying her face
in her hands upon his knees; "if I am called upon to bear these miseries, I will remember it."

"And look up, Victorine; look up, dearest. I would have you prepared for the worst. Listen
to me now calmly, love, and then I need not harrow you with these thoughts again. It may be
God's pleasure that I should outlive this war; but as, with His will, I am determined that
I will never lay down my sword till the soldiers of the Republic are driven from the province,
it is most improbable that I should do so. You must teach yourself, Victorine, to look for
my death, as an event certain to occur, which any day may bring forth; and when the heavy news
is brought to you, bear it as a Christian woman should bear the afflictions of this, world.
I do not ask you not to weep for me, for that would be putting too violent a constraint upon
your nature, but do not weep over much. Above all, Victorine, do not allow your sorrow to paralyse
your actions. You will have to act then, not only for yourself, but for your child--for my
daughter; and if you then give way to the violence of sorrow, who shall think and care for her?"

She laid her beautiful head upon his bosom, and wept, and promised, and prayed for him. And
when he had finished what he felt he had to say, what he wished to say once, and but once,
before he left her, he became more cheerful, and seemed to have more spirit for his work than
he had hitherto shewn.

"And so," he said, after a while, "poor Marie is in love."

"Nay; I did not say she was in love-not in the deep depth of absolute love--but I think she
is not indifferent to Henri: were she truly and earnestly in love, she would have told me so."

"Not indifferent to him, and yet not in love. Faith, Victorine, I know not the difference;
but you women are such adepts in the science, that you have your degrees of comparison in it."

"Marie, then, has not yet reached the first degree, for hers is not even downright positive
love; but I am sure she is fond of Henri's society; and now, poor girl, she must give it up--and
probably for ever."

"As you said a while since, Victorine, how should she not like his society? I can fancy no
man more fit to be the cynosure of a woman's eye than Larochejaquelin. He has that beauty which
women love to look on: the bold bright eye, the open forehead, the frank, easy smile, and his
face is only a faithful index to his heart; he is as frank as brave, and yet as tender-hearted
as he looks to be; he is specially formed to love and to be loved."

"Poor Marie! I grieve that you brought her from Durbelliere."

"Not so, Victorine; this is the place for Marie now; indeed, dear girl, she knew that well
herself. The Marquis pressed her hard to stay, and I said nothing; but Marie insisted on coming
home. I thought Henri looked somewhat more sombre than is his wont, as he was leading her down
the steps: but he cannot, must not, think of love now, Victorine. La Vendee now wants all his
energies."

"But you would not forbid him to love her, Charles?"

"I could forbid him nothing, for I love him as Joseph loved his younger brother Benjamin."

"And he will be here now backwards and forwards, will he not?"

"Probably he will--that is as circumstances may arise--he is, at any rate, as likely to be
at Clisson as Durbelliere."

"He will be more likely, Charles, take my word for it; you cannot prevent their meeting; you
cannot hinder them from loving each other."

"Were the King upon his throne, it would be my greatest joy to give my sister to my friend,
but now--it is the same for all of us--we must take the chance of these horrid times; and could
they be taught to quench the warm feelings of their young hearts, it were well for both of
them. The cold, callous disposition would escape much misery, which will weigh down to the
grave the loving and the generous."

On the next morning, Madame de Lescure spoke to her sister-in-law on the same subject. She
could not bring herself to look on things around her quite so darkly as her husband did. She
could not think that there was no longer any hope in their once happy country for the young
and the generous, the beautiful and the brave; of herself and her own lot, her thoughts were
sombre enough. De Lescure had imbued her with that presentiment, which he himself felt so strongly,
that he should perish in the conflict in which he was about to engage; but all would not surely
be doomed to share her cup of sorrow. She loved Marie dearly, and she loved Henri, not only
from what her husband so often said of him, but from what she knew of him herself; and she
longed in her woman's heart that they should be happy together.

It was still March, but it was on a bright warm spring morning, that Madame de Lescure was
walking with her sister-in-law in the gardens at Clisson. Marie was talking of her brother--of
the part he was to take in the war--of the gallant Cathelineau, and of the events which were
so quickly coming on them; but Madame de Lescure by degrees weaned her from the subject and
brought her to that on which she wished to speak.

"M. Larochejaquelin will be much here as long as this fighting lasts and M. Denot: we shall
have plenty of brave knights coming to and fro to lay their trophies at your feet."

"Poor M. Denot--his trophies if he gets any will be taken to Durbelliere; and I fear me, when
he offers them, they will not be welcomed. Agatha loves him not; she thinks he shares his adoration
too equally between her and his looking-glass."

"I do not wonder at it; no one can deny that M. Denot is attractive, but he attracts without
retaining; were I ever so much in want of lovers, I could not endure M. Denot's attentions
for more than one evening at the utmost; but our other knight--our other preux chevalier, sans
peur et sans reproche--at whose feet will he lay his trophies, Marie? who is to wreath a crown
of bay leaves for his brow?"

"His countrywomen should all unite to do it, Victorine--for he is going out to battle for them
all--every village girl, whose lover is still left to walk with her on the Sabbath evening--every
young wife, who can still lay her baby in her husband's arms--every mother, who still rejoices
in the smile of her stalwart son; they should all unite to wreath a crown for the brow of Henri
Larochejaquelin."

"And so they shall, Marie; but there will be others also, whose valour will claim a token of
admiration from the gratitude of their countrywomen; we will all do this for Henri and our
other brave defenders; but if I know his character, the gratitude of many will not make him
happy without the favour of one, and she will be the lady of his love; the remembrance of whose
smiles will bear him scatheless through the din of the battle."

"I should be vain, Victorine, if I pretended to misunderstand your questions," said Marie;
"but why you should mix my name with that of M. Larochejaquelin, without vanity I do not know."

"It does not offend you, Marie?"

"Offend me, dearest Victorine! how should I be offended with anything you could say?"

"But would it offend you to see Henri Larochejaquelin at your feet."

"Is there any girl in France who would have a right to be offended at seeing him there, if
he came with a tale of true love?"

"You may be sure at least that Henri will never sully his lips with false vows," said Madame
de Lescure.

"He has at any rate made no vows to me, Victorine, nor given me cause to suppose he ever will."

"But should he do so, Marie?"

"Now you ask me questions which you know it only becomes me to answer in one way."

"Why, Marie, I declare you and I have changed characters this morning. You are all sobriety
when I make a poor attempt at joking with you. Were I, as usual, talking of my sober cares,
you would be as giddy as a girl of fifteen, and talk to me of twenty lovers that you have."

"It is very different talking of twenty lovers, and of one."

"Then you own there is one lover in the ease--eh, Marie?"

"Now you are crafty, Victorine, and try to trap me into confessions. You know I have no confession
to make, or I should have made it long ago to you."

"I know, Marie, that Larochejaquelin is sad when you are not by, and that he has a word for
no one else when you are present; but I know not whether that means love. I know also that
your bright eyes brighten when they rest on him, and that your heart beats somewhat faster
at the mention of his name; but I know not whether that means love."

"Victorine," said Marie, turning round upon her companion her beautiful face, on which two
lustrous tears were shining, "Victorine, you are treating your poor sister unfairly. I know
not that my eyes are turned oftener on him than on others; and when my heart would play the
rebel within me, I always try to check it."

"Nay, Marie, dear Marie, I did but joke! You do not think I would accuse you of an unmaidenly
partiality; if it grieves you we will not mention Henri's name again, though I remember when
you did not spare me so easily; when Charles' name was always in my ear, when you swore that
every dress I wore was his choice, that every flower I plucked was for his eye; and there had
been no more then between Charles and me, than there has now between you and Henri; and yet
you see what has become of it. You thought yourself wonderfully clever then, Marie; you were
quite a prophetess then. Why should not I now foresee a little. Why should not I also be clever?"

"Well, Victorine, time will shew," said Marie, smiling through her tears; "but do not teach
me to love him too dearly, till I know whether he will value my love. If he would prize it,
I fear he might have it for the asking for; but I will not throw it at his feet, that he should
keep it loosely for awhile, and then scorn it, and lay it by."

CHAPTER VI

RECRUITING.

On the Monday following the meeting at Durbelliere, Larochejaquelin, Denot, the Cure of St.
Laud, Foret and Cathelineau joined M. de Lescure at Clisson, and on the day afterwards, the
soldiers of the Republic, when attempting to collect the conscripts at a small town near Clisson,
were resisted and treated as they had been at St. Florent. There was not quite so much of a
battle, for the officer in command knew what was likely to occur, and not having received any
reinforcement of troops, thought it advisable to give in early in the day, and capitulate with
the honours of war. He was allowed to march his men out of the town, each man having stipulated
that he would not again serve in any detachment sent into La Vendee for the collection of conscripts;
but they were not allowed to take their arms with them, muskets, bayonets, and gunpowder being
too valuable to the insurgents to be disregarded. So the soldiers marched unarmed to Nantes,
and from thence returned, before two months were over, in spite of the promises they had given,
and requited the mercy of the Vendeans with the most horrid cruelties.

The people were equally triumphant in many other towns. In Beauprieu, Coron, Chatillon, and
other places, the collection of conscripts was opposed successfully, and generally speaking,
without much bloodshed. In Coron, the military fired on the people, and killed three or four
of them, but were ultimately driven out, In Beauprieu, they gave up their arms at once, and
marched out of the place. In Chatillon, they attempted to defend the barracks, but they found,
when too late, that they had not a single day's provisions; and as the townspeople also knew
this, they were at no pains to besiege the stronghold of the soldiers. They knew that twenty-four
hours would starve them out. As it was, the lieutenant in command gave up, half an hour after
his usual dinner time.

These things all occurred within a week of the revolt at St. Florent. Beauprieu and Chatillon
were carried on the Wednesday. Coron was victorious on the Thursday; and on the Friday following,
a strong detachment of soldiers marched out of Cholet, of their own accord, without attempting
to collect their portion of the levy, and crossed the river Loire, at the Pont de Ce, thus
retreating from La Vendee.

These triumphs inspired the insurgents with high hopes of future victories; they gave them
the prestige of success, made them confident in the hour of battle, and taught them by degrees
to bear, undaunted, the fire of their enemies. The officers of the Republic were most injudicious
in allowing their enemies to gather head as they did; had they brought a really formidable
force of men, in one body, into the province of Anjou, immediately upon the revolt of St. Florent,
they might doubtless have driven the Vendeans, who were then unarmed and undisciplined, back
to their farms; but they affected to despise them, they neglected to take vigorous measures,
till the whole country was in arms; and they then found that all the available force which
they were enabled to collect, was insufficient to quell the spirit, or daunt the patriotism
of the revolted provinces.

Towards the end of April, the first attempt was made by the Vendean chiefs to collect a body
of men under arms, and to put them into motion, for the purpose of performing service at a
distance from their own homes; and though considerable difficulty was felt in inducing them
to follow the standards, their first attempts were successful. In the early part of May, they
altogether succeeded in driving the soldiers out of Thouars. A few days later, they did the
same at Fontenay, though here they met with a violent opposition, and much blood was shed.
At these two latter places, the cannon which Cathelineau had taken in so gallant a manner at
St. Florent, was brought into action, and quite supported its character as a staunch royalist.
At Fontenay, with its aid, they took three or four other pieces of cannon, but none which they
prized as they did Marie Jeanne. It was universally credited among the peasantry, that at Cathelineau's
touch, this remarkable piece of artillery had positively refused to discharge itself against
the Vendeans; and their leaders certainly were at no pains to disabuse them of a belief which
contributed so strongly to their enthusiasm.

Some of the more astute among the people had certainly thought for a while that the cannon
was a humbug, that it was useless either to royalist or to republican, in fact, that it would
never go off at all. But these sceptics were cured of their infidelity at Thouars, when they
saw the soldiers as well as the republicans of the town fall in heaps beneath the thunders
of Marie Jeanne.

During April and the three weeks of May, Larochejaquelin and de Lescure, together with Cathelineau,
Denot, and M. Bonchamps, were actively engaged in collecting and exhorting the people, planning
what they should do, and preparing themselves to bear that burst of republican fury which they
knew would, sooner or later, fall upon them.

Much of this time was spent at Clisson, as that place was centrically situated for their different
manoeuvres; and there certainly appeared reason to suppose that Madame de Lescure was not altogether
wrong in her surmises respecting Marie. Here also, at Clisson, Cathelinean frequently joined
the party, and though he shewed by his language and demeanour that he had not forgotten that
he was a postillion, he gradually acquired a confidence and ease of manner among his new associates,
and displayed a mixture of intelligence and enthusiasm, which induced his confederates gene.
rally to acknowledge his voice as the first in their councils.

They were occasionally at Durbelliere; but there Cathelineau was again abashed and confused.
He could not calmly endure the quiet loveliness of Agatha's face, or the sweet music of her
voice. He himself felt that his brain was not cool when there; that his mind was gradually
teaching itself to dwell on subjects, which in his position would be awfully dangerous to him.
He never owned to himself that he was in love with the fair angel, whom he considered as much
above him as the skies are above the earth; but he would walk for hours through those eternal
paths in the chateau garden, regardless of the figures, regardless of the various turns and
twists he took, dreaming of the bliss of being beloved by such a woman as Agatha Larochejaquelin.
He built for himself splendid castles in the air, in which he revelled day after day; and in
these dreams he always endowed himself with that one gift which no talents, no courage, no
success could give him--high birth and noble blood, for he strongly felt that without these,
no one might look up to the goddess of his idolatry; it was his delight to imagine to himself
with what ecstasy he would receive from her lips the only adequate reward of his patriotism;
he would quicken his pace with joy as he dreamt that he heard her sweet voice bidding him to
persevere, and then he would return to her after hard fighting, long doubtful but victorious
battles, and lay at her feet honours worthy of her acceptance.

It can hardly be said that he himself was the hero of his own reveries; he was assured beyond
the shadow of a doubt, that the proud happiness which he pictured to his imagination was as
much beyond his own reach, as though his thoughts were turned on some celestial being. No,
it was a creation of his brain, in which he dwelt awhile, till his own strong good sense reminded
him that he had other work before him than the indulgence in such dreams, and he determined
that he would be at Durbelliere as little as was possible.

It was singular though, that he contrived, while his imagination was thus rambling, to mingle
in his thoughts the actual and the ideal. The revolt of La Vendee, the struggle of his brother
royalists for the restoration of their King; the annihilation of republicanism, and re-establishment
of the old clergy, were still the subjects of his meditations; and the bold plans which his
mind then suggested to him, were those which were afterwards put into effect.

He still insisted on attacking the strongly fortified citadel of Saumur, and after their success
at Fontenay, the chiefs agreed at once to make arrangements for that great undertaking. The
tenth of June was settled on as the day on which the attack should be commenced, and their
utmost efforts in the mean time were to be employed in raising recruits, arming and drilling
them, and collecting ammunition and stores of war sufficient for so serious an operation.

For this purpose Cathelineau returned for a while to St. Florent. M. Charette was requested
to bring up all the men he could collect from the Marais, a part of La Vendee which lies close
upon the sea. M. Bonchamps was invited to join them from Angers. De Lescure returned to Fontenay,
to ask the assistance of those who had been so successful there against the republicans; while
Henri Larochejaquelin, was left at home in the Bocage, to secure the services of every available
man from every village.

He had two comrades with him in his recruiting party; and though they were of very different
characters, they were almost equally serviceable. One was his friend and priest, the Cure of
St. Laud, and the other was his servant, Jacques Chapeau. The Cure had no scrupulous compunction
in using his sacerdotal authority as a priest, when the temporal influence of Larochejaquelin,
as landlord, was insufficient to induce a countryman to leave his wife and home to seek honour
under the walls of Saumur. The peasants were all willing to oppose the republican troops, should
they come into their own neighbourhood to collect conscripts; they were ready to attack any
town where republican soldiers were quartered, providing they were not required to go above
a day's march from their own homes; but many objected to enrol themselves for any length of
time, to bind themselves as it were to a soldier's trade, and to march under arms to perform
service at a distance from their farms, which to them seemed considerable. With such men as
these, and with their wives and sisters, Henri argued, and used his blandest eloquence, and
was usually successful; but when he failed, the Cure was not slow in having recourse to the
irresistable thunders of the church.

No one could have been fitter for the duties of a recruiting-sergeant than Jacques Chapeau;
and to his great natural talents in that line, he added a patriotic zeal, which he copied from
his master. No one could be more zealous in the service of the King, and for the glory of La
Vendee, than was Jacques Chapeau. Jacques had been in Paris with his master, and finding that
all his fellow-servants in the metropolis were admirers of the revolution, he had himself acquired
a strong revolutionary tendency. His party in Paris had been the extreme Ultra-Democrats: he
had been five or six times at the Jacobins, three or four times at the Cordeliers; he had learnt
to look on a lamp-rope as the proper destination of an aristocrat, and considered himself equal
to anybody, bu his master, and his master's friends. On Henri's return to La Vendee, he had
imbued himself with a high tone of loyalty, without any difficulty or constraint on his feelings;
indeed, he was probably unaware that he had changed his party: he had an appetite for strong
politics, was devotedly attached to his master, and had no prudential misgivings whatsoever.
He had already been present at one or two affairs in which his party had been victorious, and
war seemed to him twice more exciting, twice more delightful than the French Opera, or even
the Jacobin Clubs.

Jacques Chapeau was about five years older than his master, and was as active and well made
a little Frenchman, as ever danced all night at a ball outside the barriers of Paris. He was
a light-hearted and kind-hearted creature, although he always considered it necessary to have
mortal enemies--horrid, blasphemous, blood-thirsty fellows, men devoid of feeling, without
faith, hope, or charity, who would willingly slaughter women and children for the mere pleasure
of doing so. Such, in Chapeau's imagination, were all his enemies--such had been the aristocrats
during the time of his revolutionary fervour--such now were the republicans. Chapeau loved
his own side truly and faithfully, without any admixture of self in his calculations, but I
certainly cannot say for him that he was a good Christian, for all the clergymen in Anjou could
not have taught him to love his enemies.

On a beautiful summer's morning, on the 2nd of June, this remarkable recruiting party rode
from Durbelliere to the little village of Echanbroignes; the distance was about four leagues,
and their road lay, the whole way, through the sweet green leafy lanes of the Bocage. The aspect
of this province is very singular, and in summer most refreshing. The country is divided into
small farms, which are almost entirely occupied with pasture; the farms are again divided into
small fields, and each field is surrounded by a belt of trees, growing out of high, green,
flowering hedges. The face of the country is like a thickly wooded demesne, divided and subdivided
into an infinity of little paddocks. The narrow lanes of the country, which are barely broad
enough for the wheels of a carriage, and are seldom visited by such a vehicle, lie between
thick, high hedges, which completely overshadow them; the wayfarer, therefore, never has before
him that long, straight, tedious, unsightly line of road, which adds so greatly to the fatigue
of travelling in an open country, and is so painful to the eye.

Through such a lane as this our party rode quickly and cheerily; quickly, for they had much
work before them for that day; and cheerily, for they knew that the people among whom they
were going would join them with enthusiasm. They were all well mounted, for they rode the best
horses from the stables of Durbelliere: the old Marquis would have blushed to have given less
than the best to the service of his King.

Chapeau was peculiarly elated at the prospect of his day's work; but his joy was not wholly
professional; for Jacques now accounted himself a soldier by profession. He had another reason
for the more than ordinary gaiety with which he trotted on towards Echanbroignes. There was
there a certain smith, named Michael Stein, who had two stalwart sons, whom Jacques burnt to
enrol in his loyal band of warriors; this smith had also one daughter, Annot Stein, who, in
the eyes of Jacques Chapeau, combined every female charm; she was young and rosy; she had soft
hair and bright eyes; she could dance all night, and was known to possess in her on right some
mysterious little fortune, left to her by nobody knew what grandfather or grandmother, and
amounting, so said report, to the comfortable sum of five hundred francs. When Chapeau had
risen to some high military position, a field-marshal's baton, or the gold-laced cap of a serjeant-major,
with whom could he share his honours better than with his dear little friend, Annot Stein?
Jacques wanted her advice upon this subject, and he therefore rejoiced greatly that the path
of duty was leading him this morning to Echanbroignes.

"We may be sure, Father Jerome," said Henri, "of those men from St. Michael?"

"Of every man. You will find there will not be a defaulter."

"God send it; one traitor makes many, as sheep follow each other through a hedge row."

"Do not fear them, my son. Father Francois has the list of them; he will have every man collected
by daylight on the 7th, and he will come on with them himself as far as the cross-roads; they
will there meet my own children from St. Laud."

"There were to be one hundred and seventy-five from St. Michael."

"Yes; and one hundred and forty from St. Laud; and thirty will have joined us from Petit Ange
de Poitou before we reach the turn from St. Michael."

"And have you positively determined you will start with them from St. Laud's yourself, Father
Jerome."

"With God's will, my son, I most assuredly shall do so; and from that to the walls of Saumur,
they shall see before them my tattered Cure's frock, and the blessed symbol of their hope.
I will carry the cross before them from the porch of the little church which shall once more
be my own, till I plant it on the citadel of Saumur beside the standard of the King."

"Oh! if we had a few more Father Jeromes!" said Henri.

"There might perhaps be more soldiers in La Vendee than at present; but perhaps also there
would be fewer Christians," said the priest. "May God forgive me if, in my zeal for my King,
I am too remiss in His service."

They rode on a little way in silence, for Father Jerome felt a slight qualm of conscience at
his warlike proceedings, and Henri did not like to interrupt his meditations; but the Cure
soon recovered himself.

"I shall have a goodly assemblage of followers," said he, "before I reach Coron. Those from
Echanbroignes will join us half-a-mile from the town. There will be above two hundred from
Echanbroignes."

"Will there? So many as that, think you?"

"They will muster certainly not short of two hundred. Near seven hundred men will follow me
into Coron on the evening of the 7th."

"They will find provisions there in plenty--meat, bread, and wine. They are not used to lie
soft; they will not grumble at having clean straw to sleep on."

"They shall grumble at nothing, my friend; if your care can supply them with food, well; if
not, we will find bread enough among the townsfolk. There is not a housewife in Coron, who
would refuse me the contents of her larder."

"The bullocks are ready for the butcher's axe in the stalls at Durbelliere, please your reverence,"
said Chapeau, who rode near enough to his master to take a part in the conversation as occasion
offered. "And the stone wine-jars are ready corked. Momont saw to the latter part himself.
May the saints direct that the drinking have not the same effect upon our friends that the
corking had on Momont, or there will be many sick head-aches in Coron on the next morning."

"There will be too many of us for that, Jacques. Five hundred throats will dispose of much
good wine, so as to do but little injury."

"That would be true, your reverence, were not some throats so much wider than others. You will
always see that one porker half empties the trough before others have moistened their snouts
in the mess."

"We will see to that, Jacques. We will appoint some temperate fellow butler, or rather some
strong-fisted fellow, whose thick head much wine will not hurt; though he may swill himself
he will not let others do so."

"If it were not displeasing to yourself and to M. Henri, I would undertake all that myself.
Each man of the five hundred should have his own share of meat and drink at Coron, and the
same again at Doue."

"Will not Jacques be with you?" said the priest, turning round to Henri. "What should bring
him to Coron among my men?"

"He says he has friends here in Echanbroignes, and he has begged that he may be here with them
on the evening of the 6th, so as to accompany them into Coron on the 7th. We shall all meet
at Doue on the 8th."

"I was thinking, your reverence, if any here were loiterers, as there may be some, I fear;
or if there should be any ill inclined to leave their homes, my example might encourage them.
I have a liking for the village, and I should feel disgraced were a single able-bodied man
to be found near it after the morning of the 7th."

"I trust they will not need any one to remind them of their promise, when they have once pledged
themselves to the service of their King," said the priest. "However, you will be, doubtless,
useful to me at Coron. But, Henri, what will you do without him?"

"Adolphe and I will be together, and will do well. We shall have an absolute barrack at Durbelliere.
We shall have above one hundred men in the house. Agatha and the women are at work night and day."

"You have the worst part of the whole affair--the ammunition."

"It is all packed and ready for the carts; a few days since the cellars were half-full of the
lead and iron, which we have been casting; they are now, I trust, half-way to Saumur, under
Foret's care."

"How many men has he with him?" asked the priest.

"He has all the men from Clisson, from St. Paul's and St. Briulph's-- except a few of Charles'
own tenants, who went on forward to join him at Doue, and who have our supply of flags with
them, made in the chateau at Clisson. Madame de Lescure and poor Marie have worked their fingers
to the bone."

"God bless them! God will bless them, for they are working in the spirit which he loves."

"Agatha and Annette, between them, have packed nearly every ounce of gunpowder," said Henri,
who could not help boasting of his sister. "Night and day they have been handling it without
regarding for a moment the destruction which the slightest accident might bring upon them."

"It is that spirit, my son, which will enable us to beat twice our own strength in numbers,
and ten times our own strength in arms and discipline How many men has Foret with him?"

"Above six hundred. I do not know his exact numbers," said Henri.

"And you, yourself?"

"I shall muster a thousand strong, that is for a certainty; I believe I shall be nearer twelve
thousand."

"Let me see--that will be, say two thousand five hundred from the Bocage."

"Oh! more than that your reverence," said Chapeau, "you are not counting M. de Lescure's men,
who have gone on with the flags--or the men from Beauprieu who will follow M. d'Elbee, or the
men from St. Florent, who will come down with Cathelineau."

"I don't count Beauprieu, or Cholet or St. Florent; there will be two thousand five hundred
from our own country, out of three thousand three hundred male adults, that is three men, Henry,
out of every four--they cannot at any rate say that the spirit of the people is not with us."

As the priest spoke, they rode into the street of the little village of Echanbroignes, and
having stopped at the door of the Mayor's house, Henri and the Cure dismounted, and giving
their horses up to Jacques, warmly greeted that worthy civic authority, who came out to meet them.

The appointment of a mayor in every village in France, had been enjoined at an early time in
the revolution, and after the death of the King, these functionaries were, generally speaking,
strong republicans; but the Vendeans in opposition to the spirit of the revolution, had persisted
in electing the Seigneurs, wherever they could get a Seigneur to act as mayor; and, where this
was not the case, some person in the immediate employment of the landlord was chosen. This
was the case at Echanbroignes, where the agent or intendant of the proprietor was mayor. He
expected the visit which was now paid to him, and having twenty times expressed his delight
at the honour which was done him, he got his hat and accompanied his visitors to the door of
the church, where with his own hands he commenced a violent assault on the bell-rope, which
hung down in the middle of the porch.

He was ringing the tocsin, which was to call together the people of the village. They also
very generally knew who was coming among them on that day, and the purpose for which they were
corning; and at the first sound of the bell, all such as intended to shew themselves, came
crowding on to the little space before the church; it was but few who remained at home, and
they were mostly those to whom home at the present moment was peculiarly sweet; one or two
swains newly married, or just about to be married; one or two fathers, who could hardly bring
themselves in these dangerous times to leave their little prattling children, and one or two
who were averse to lose the profits of their trade.

In spite of the speedy appearance of his townspeople, the Mayor persisted in his operations
on the bell-rope until the perspiration ran down his face. He was sounding the tocsin, and
he felt the importance of what he was doing. Every one knew that a tocsin bell to be duly rung,
should be rung long and loud--not with a little merry jingle, such as befitted the announcement
of a wedding, but in a manner to strike astonishment, if not alarm, into its hearers; and on
this occasion great justice was done to the tocsin.

"That will do, M. Mayor; that will do, I think!" said the Cure, "it looks to me as though our
friends were all here."

The Mayor gave an awful pull, the bell leapt wildly up, gave one loud concluding flourish,
and then was quiet.

"Now, M. Mayor," said the Cure, "you have by heart the few words I gave you, have you not?"

"Indeed, Father Jerome, I have," said the Mayor, "and am not likely to forget them. Let me
see--let me see. Now, my friends, will you be quiet a moment while I speak to you. Ambrose
Corvelin, will you hold your noisy tongue awhile--perhaps M. de Larochejaquelin, I had better
get up on the wall, they will hear me better?"

"Do, M. Mayor, do," said Henri; and the Mayor was lifted on to the low wall which ran round
the churchyard, and roared out the following words, at the top of his voice:

"In the holy name of God, and by command of the King, this parish of Echanbroignes is invited
to send as many men as possible to Saumur, to be there, or at any other such place in the neighbourhood
as may be appointed, at three o'clock on the afternoon of the 9th of June. And may God defend
the right. Amen!" And having said this, the Mayor jumped off the wall, and the crowd commenced
shouting and cheering.

"Wait one moment, and hear me say a few words, my friends," said Henri, springing to the place
which the Mayor had just left. "Most of you, I believe, know who I am."

"We do, M Henri," said they. "We do, M. Larochejaquelin. We all know who you are. We know that
you are our friend."

"I am very glad you think so," continued he; "for you will know, that if I am your friend,
I shall not deceive you. I have come here to ask you to share with me the honour and the danger
of restoring his father's kingdom and his father's throne to the son of your murdered King.
I have come here to ask you also to assist me and others, who are your friends, in protecting
yourselves, your pastors, your houses, your wives and daughters, from the tyranny and cruelty
of the republicans."

"We will!" shouted the crowd. "We will go at once. We will be at Saumur on Wednesday. We will
follow M. Larochejaquelin wherever he would lead us."

"You all know Cathelineau," continued Henri; "you all know the good postillion of St. Florent?"

"We do, God bless him! we do. We all know the Saint of Anjou."

"Come and meet him, my friends, under the walls of Saumur; or rather, I should say, come and
meet him within the walls of Saumur. Come and greet the noble fellows of St. Florent, who have
set us so loyal an example. Come and meet the brave men of Fontenay, who trampled on the dirty
tricolour, and drove out General Coustard from his covert, like a hunted fox. He is now at
Saumur; we will turn him out from thence."

"We will! we will! We will hang up Coustard by the heels."

"We will strip him rather of his spurs and his epaulettes, of his sword and blue coat, and
send him back to the Convention, that they may see what will become of the heroes, whom they
send to seek for glory in La Vendee. Thanks, my friends; thanks for your kindness. I will lead
you to no dangers which I will not share with you. You shall suffer no hardship of which I
will not partake. I will look for no glory in which you shall not be my partners."

During the time that the Mayor had been giving his invitation to the people, and Henri had
been speaking to them, Father Jerome had been busily employed with Jacques Chapeau over six
or seven little lists which he held in his hand. These were lists of the names of able-bodied
men, which had been drawn out by the Cure of the parish, and Jacques had already marked those
of one or two whom he had found to be absent, and among them the names of Michael Stems' two
stalwart sons. Father Jerome again handed the lists to Jacques, and as Henri descended from
the wall, amid the greeting of the populace, he ascended it, and gave them a little clerical
admonition.

"My children," said he, "it delights my heart to find that so few of you are absent from us
this morning--from the whole parish there are but five, I believe, who have not readily come
forward to proclaim their zeal for their God, their King, and their Church: those five, I doubt
not, will be here when we proceed to check the names. Let it not be said that there was one
recreant in Echanbroignes--one man afraid to answer when called for by his country. Is there
danger in the bloody battle we have before us?--let us all share it, and it will be lighter.
Is it a grievous thing for you to leave your wives and your children?--let no man presume to
think that he will be happier than his neighbours, for that man shall assuredly be the most
miserable. It is possible that some of you may leave your bodies beneath the walls of Saumur,
be it so; will you complain because the Creator may require from some of you the life which
he has given? Is it not enough for you to know, that he who falls fighting with this blessed
symbol before his eyes, shall that night rest among the angels of Heaven?" and the Cure held
up on high, above the people, a huge cross, which he bad had brought to him out of the church.
"God has blessed you, my children, in giving you the sacred privilege of fighting in His cause.
You would indeed be weak--senseless as the brutes--unfeeling as the rocks--aye, impious as
the republicans, had you not replied to the summons as you have done; but you have shown that
you know your duty. I see, my children, that you are true Vendeans. I bless you now, and on
tomorrow week, I will be among you before the walls of Saumur."

Having finished speaking, the priest also jumped off the wall, and again the people shouted
and cheered. And now they went to work with the lists: Henri, the Mayor, and the Cure each
took a pencil, and called the names of the different men, as they were written down. There
was of course much delay in getting the men as they were called; but Chapeau had sworn in three
or four assistants, and he and they dived in among the crowd, hurried this way and that, and
shouted, screamed, and screeched with great effect. The lists were made out with some regard
to the localities; the men from the lower end of the village were to go to Henri's side; those
from the northern part to Father Jerome's table; and the inhabitants of the intermediate village
were checked off by the Mayor. Chapeau and his friends were most diligent in marshalling them;
to be sure, Jacques knew the names of but few of them; but he made them tell him whether they
were villagers, northerns, or lower-end men; and though the men in many instances couldn't
answer this themselves, the divisions were effected, the names of all were called over, those
who were there were checked off and informed what was expected of them, and where and by whom
arms would be supplied to them: and those who were not there became the unhappy victims of
a black list.

Father Jerome, when he said that there were only five absent, was something but not much out
in his reckoning: his object, however, had been to make the people think that he knew exactly
who was there, and who was not there; and in this he was successful. During the calling of
the lists, one or two stragglers dropped in who hoped to escape detection: respecting a few
others, some good ground of excuse was alleged; but on this head the Cure was most severe:
he would accept no plea but that of absolute downright sickness, and of this he required to
have most ample testimony--even Henri sometimes pleaded for the people, but unsuccessfully.
The Republic by their proscription would have decimated the men; the Cure of St. Laud insisted
on taking them all.

The houses of those who had not presented themselves were to be visited, and the two first
on the list were Jean and Peter Stein.

"Jean and Peter Stein," said Henri. "Why, Jacques, are they not friends of yours? are they
not sons of Michael Stein, the smith?"

The men from six to ten, as July'Fight.

If they did yield nothing to be in sizing swampy spot, than they have frequently occur angleworm
of here become over a queer leaf.
 Old Michael Stein is very fond of money; and every one
in the country who owns a franc at all, is buying an old sword or a gun, or turning a reaping-hook
into a sabre, or getting a long pike made with an axe at the end of it; so Michael Stein's
smithy is turned into a perfect armoury, and he and his two sons are at work at the anvil morning,
noon, and night: they made Annot blow the bellows this morning, till she looks for all the
world like a tinker's wife."

"That alters the case," said Father Jerome; "they are doing good service, if they are making
arms for our men; they are better employed than though they joined us themselves."

"Don't say so, Father Jerome," said Jacques, "pray don't say so, Jean and Peter would die were
they not to be of the party at Saumur; but Michael is so passionate and so headstrong, and
he swears they shall not go. Now go they will, and therefore I supplicate that my word may
be taken, and that I may be saved the dishonour of hearing the names of my friends read out
aloud with those of men who will disgrace their parish and their country."

The request of Jacques was granted, and the names of Jean and Peter Stein were erased from
the top of the black list.

It was eight in the evening before the recruiting party had finished their work, and it was
not yet noon when they rode into the little village. Henri and the Cure got their supper and
slept at the Mayor's house, and even there they were not allowed to be quiet; some of those
who were to be at Saumur, were continually calling for new instructions; one wanted to know
what arms he was to carry, another what provisions he was to bring, a third was anxious to
be a corporal, and a fourth and fifth begged that they might not be separated, as one was going
to marry the sister of the other. None of these were turned away unanswered; the door of the
Mayor's house was not closed for a moment, and Henri, to be enabled to eat his supper at all,
was obliged to give his last military orders with a crust of bread in his hand, and his mouth
full of meat.

As might be supposed, Jacques spent the evening with Annot Stein, at least it was his intention
to have done so; but he had been so leading a person in the day's transactions that he also
was besieged by the villagers, and was hardly able to whisper a word into his sweetheart's
ear. There he sat, however, very busy and supremely happy in the smith's kitchen, with a pipe
in his mouth and a bottle of wine before him. The old smith sat opposite to him, while the
two young men stood among a lot of others round the little table, and Annot bustled in and
out of the room, now going close enough up to her lover to enable him. to pinch her elbow unseen
by her father, and then leaning against the dresser, and listening to his military eloquence.

"And so, my friend," said Chapeau, "Jean and Peter are not to go to Saumur?"

"Not a foot, Chapeau," said the old man, "not a foot, Chapeau; let ye fight, we will make swords
for you: is not that fair, neighbour?"

"I have nothing to say against it, M. Stein, not a word; only such fellows as they, they would
surely get promoted."

"Oh, ay; you will all be sergeants, no doubt. I have nothing to say against that; only none
of mine shall go waging wars in distant lands."

"Distant lands, say you! is not Saumur in Anjou? and is not Anjou within three miles of you,
here where you are sitting?"

"May be so, M. Chapeau; but still, with your leave, I say Saumur is distant. Can you get there
in one day from here?"

"Why no, not in one day."

"Nor in two?"

"Why, no again; though they might do it in two. They'll start from here Monday morning with
light, and they'll reach Saumur on Wednesday in time to look about them, and learn what they
have to do the next morning."

"That's three day's going, and three coming, and heaven only knows how many days there; and
you don't call that distant! Who's to feed them all I'd like to know?"

"Feed them!" said Chapeau. "I wish you could see all the bullocks and the wine at Durbelliere;
they'll have rations like fighting-cocks. I only pray that too much good living make them not
lazy."

"Were I a man," said Annot, as she put on the table a fresh bottle of wine, which she had just
brought in from the little inn, "were I a man, as I would I were, I would go, whether or no."

"Would you, minx," said the father; "it's well for you that your petticoats keep you at home."

"Don't be too sure of her, Michael Stein," said Paul Rouel, the keeper of the inn; "she'll
marry a soldier yet before the wars are over."

"Let her do as her mother did before her, and marry an honest tradesman; that is, if she can
find one to take her."

"Find one!" said Annot, "if I can't get a husband without finding one, indeed, I'm sure I'll
not fash myself with seeking: let him find me that wants me."

"And it wont be the first that finds you either, that'll be allowed to take to you, will it
Annot?" said the innkeeper.

"That's as may be, Master Rouel," said Annot. "Those who ask no questions are seldom told many
lies."

"I know Annot Stein loves a soldier in her heart," said another old man, who was sitting inside
the large open chimney. "The girls think there is no trade like soldiering. I went for a soldier
when I was young, and it was all to oblige Lolotte Gobelin; and what think ye, when I was gone,
she got married to Jean Geldert, down at Petit Ange. There's nothing for the girls like soldiering."

"You give us great encouragement truly," said Jacques. "I hope our sweethearts will not all
do as Lolotte did. You would not serve your lover so, when he was fighting for his King and
country--would you, Annot?"

"I might, then, if I didn't like him," said she.

"She's no better than her neighbours, M. Chapeau," said one of her brothers. "There was young
Boullin, the baker, at St. Paul's. Till we heard of these wars, Annot was as fond of him as
could be. It was none but he then; but now, she will not as much as turn her head if she sees
his white jacket."

"Hold thine unmannerly, loutish, stupid tongue, wilt thou, thou dolt," said Annot, deeply offended.
"Boullin indeed! I danced with him last harvest-home; I know not why, unless for sheer good-nature;
and now, forsooth, I am to have Boullin for ever thrust in my teeth. Bah! I hate a baker. I
would as lieve take a butcher at once."

Jacques Chapean also was offended.

"I wonder, Jean Stein," said he, "that you know not better than to liken your sister to such
as young Boullin--a very good young man in his way, I have no doubt. You should remember there
is a difference in these things."

"I don't know," said Jean, "why a smith's daughter should not marry a baker's son; but I did
not mean to vex Annot, and will say no more about him; only good bread is a very good thing
to have in one's house."

"And a butcher is a good trade too," said the old man inside the chimney. "Jean Geldert, he
that Lolotte Gobelin ran off with, he was a butcher."

CHAPTER VII

SUNDAY IN THE BOCAGE.

The remainder of that week was spent by Henri and the Cure as actively and as successfully
as the day in which they visited Echanbroignes. The numbers they enrolled exceeded their hopes,
and they found among the people many more arms than they expected, though mostly of a very
rude kind. The party separated on the Saturday night, with the understanding that they were
to meet together at Done on the Tuesday evening, to proceed from thence to the attack of Saumur.
Henri Larochejaquelin returned to Durbelliere. The Cure of St. Laud went to his own parish,
to perform mass among his own people on the following morning, and Jacques Chapeau, according
to agreement, took up his quarters at the smith's house in Echanbroignes.

On the following morning, he and Annot, and most of the young men and women of the village
walked over to St. Laud's to receive mass from Father Jerome, and to hear the discourse which
he had promised to give respecting the duties of the people in the coming times.

The people, as in olden days, were crowded round the church about half-past ten o'clock; but
the doors of the church were closed. The revolt in La Vendee had already gone far enough to
prevent the possibility of the constitutional priests officiating in the churches to which
they had been appointed by the National Assembly; but it had not yet gone far enough to enable
the old nonjuring Cures to resume generally their own places in their own churches: the people,
however, now crowded round the church of St. Laud's, till they should learn where on that day
Father Jerome would perform mass.

The church of St. Laud's did not stand in any village, nor was it surrounded even by a cluster
of cottages. It stood by itself on the side of a narrow little road, and was so completely
surrounded by beech and flowering ash trees, that a stranger would not know that he was in
the neighbourhood of a place of worship till it was immediately in front of him. Opposite to
the door of the church and on the other side of the road, was a cross erected on a little mound;
and at its foot a Capuchin monk in his arse brown frock, with his hood thrown back, and his
eyes turned to heaven, was always kneeling: the effigy at least of one was doing so, for it
was a painted wooden monk that was so perpetually at his prayers.

The church itself was small, but it boasted of a pretty grey tower; and on each side of the
door of the church were two works of art, much celebrated in the neighbourhood. On the left
side, beneath the window, a large niche was grated in with thick, rusty iron bars. It occupied
the whole extent from the portico to the corner of the church, and from the ground to the window;
and, within the bars, six monster demons--spirits of the unrepentent dead, the forms of wretches
who had died without owning the name of their Saviour, were withering in the torments of hell-fire;
awful indeed was the appearance of these figures; they were larger than human, and twisted
into every variety of contortion which it was conceived possible that agony could assume. Their
eyes were made to protrude from their faces, their fiery tongues were hanging from their scorched
lips; the hairs of each demon stood on end and looked like agonized snakes; they were of various
hideous colours; one was a dingy blue; another a horrid dirty yellow, as though perpetual jaundice
were his punishment; another was a foul unhealthy green; a fourth was of a brick-dust colour;
a fifth was fiery red, and he was leaping high as though to escape the flame; but in vain,
for a huge blue flake of fire had caught him by the leg, and bound him fast; his fiery red
hands were closed upon the bars, his tortured face was pressed against them, and his screeching
mouth was stretched wide open so as to display two awful rows of red-hot teeth; the sixth a
jet black devil, cowered in a corner and grinned, as though even there he had some pleasure
in the misery of his companions.

The space occupied on the other side was much larger, for it was carried up so far as to darken
a great portion of the window. That on the left represented the misery of hell--torment without
hope. That on the right contained two tableaus: the lower one was purgatory, here four recumbent
figures lay in the four corners, uncomfortably enough; for the bed of each figure was six sharp
spikes, each of which perforated the occupier of it. But yet these dead men were not horrible
to look at as those six other wretches; their eyes were turned on a round aperture above, the
edge of which was all gilt and shining, for the glory of heaven shone into it. This aperture
entered into paradise. Through the aperture the imaginative artist had made a spirit to be
passing---his head and shoulders were in paradise; these were also gilt and glorious, and on
his shoulders two little seraphims were fixing wings; his nether parts below the aperture,
were still brown and dingy, as were the four recumbent spirits who rested on their gridirons
till the time should come that they also should be passed through.

Above the aperture was to be seen paradise in all its blazon of glory, numberless little golden-headen
cherubims encircled a throne, on which was seated the beneficent majesty of Heaven. From the
towers and roofs projected numerous brazen-mouthed instruments, which welcomed into everlasting
joy the purified spirit which was ascending from purgatory.

Thus were paradise, purgatory and pandemonium represented at St. Laud's, and abominable as
such representations now appear to be, they had, to a certain extent, a salutary effect with
the people who were in the habit of looking at them. That they were absolute accurate representations
of the places represented, they never for a moment presumed to doubt; and if the joys of heaven,
as displayed there, were not of much avail in adding to the zeal of the faithful, the horrors
of hell were certainly most efficacious in frightening the people into compliance with the
rules laid down for them, and in preventing them from neglecting their priests and religious
duties.

The people were crowded round the church; some were kneeling with the wooden monk at the foot
of the cross, and some round the bars of purgatory. Others were prostrated before the six condemned
demons, and some sat by the road-side, on the roots of the trees, telling their beads. Many
men were talking of the state of the times, and of the wars to come; some were foretelling
misery and desolation, and others were speaking of the happy days about to return, when their
King and their priests should have their own, and La Vendee should be the most honoured province
in France.

They made a pretty scene, waiting there beneath the shade till their priest should come to
lead them to some rural chapel. The bright colours worn by the women in their Sunday clothes,
and the picturesque forms of the men, in their huge broad-brimmed flapping hats, harmonized
well with the thick green foliage around them. They shewed no sign of impatience, they were
quite content to wait there, and pray, or gossip, or make love to each other, till such time
as Father Jerome should please to come; they had no idea that their time was badly spent in
waiting for so good a man.

At any rate he came before they were tired, and with him came a man who was a stranger to them
all, except to Jacques Chapeau. This man was but little, if anything, better dressed than themselves;
he looked like one of their own farmers of the better days; certainly from his dress and manner
he had no pretensions to be called a gentleman, and yet he walked and talked with Father Jerome
as though he were his equal.

"God bless you, my children, God bless you," said the Cure, in answer to the various greetings
he received from his flock. "Follow me, my children, and we will worship God beneath the canopy
of his holy throne," and then turning to the stranger, he added: "the next time you visit me
at St. Laud's, M. d'Elbee, we shall, I doubt not, have our church again. I could now desire
the people to force the doors for me, and no one would dare to hinder them; but I have been
thrust from my altar and pulpit by a self-constituted vain authority--but yet by authority;
and I will not resume them till I do so by the order of the King or of his servants."

"I reverence the house of God," replied M. d'Elbee, "because his spirit has sanctified it;
but walls and pillars are not necessary to my worship; a cross beneath a rock is as perfect
a church to them who have the will to worship, as though they had above them the towers of
Notre Dame, or the dome of St. Peter's."

"You are right, my son; it is the heart that God regards; and where that is in earnest, his
mercy will dispense with the outward symbols of our religion; but still it is our especial
duty to preserve to his use everything which the piety of former ages has sanctified; to part
willingly with nothing which appertains in any. way to His church. The best we have is too
little for His glory. It should be our greatest honour to give to Him; it is through His great
mercy that He receives our unworthy offerings. Come, my children, follow me; our altar is prepared
above."

The priest led the way through a little shaded path at the back of the church; behind a farmhouse
and up a slight acclivity, on the side of which the rocks in different places appeared through
the green turf, and the crowd followed him at a respectful distance.

"And who is that with Father Jerome--who is the stranger, M. Chapeau?" said one and another
of them, crowding round Jacques--for it soon got abroad among them, that Jacques Chapeau had
seen the stranger in some of his former military movements in La Vendee. Chapeau was walking
beside his mistress, and was not at all sorry of the opportunity of shewing off.

"Who is he, indeed?" said Jacques. "Can it be that none of you know M. d'Elbee?"

"D'Elbee!--d'Elbee!--indeed; no, then, I never heard the name till this moment," said one.

"Nor I," said another; "but he must be a good man, or Father Jerome would not walk with him
just before performing mass."

"You are right there, Jean," said Jacques, "M. d'Elbee is a good man; he has as much religion
as though he were a priest himself."

"And he must be a thorough royalist," said another, "or Father Jerome wouldn't walk with him
at all."

"You are right, too, my friend; M. d'Elbee is a great royalist. He is the especial friend of
our good Cathelineau."

"The friend of Cathelineau and of Father Jerome," said a fourth, "then I am sure M. d'Elbee
must be something out of the common way."

"You are right again, he is very much out of the common way, he is one of our great generals,"
said Chapeau.

"One of our great generals, is he," said two or three at once. "I knew he was going to Saumur,"
said Jean, "or Father Jerome wouldn't have walked so peaceable with him, great as he may be."

"But if he is a great general," said Annot, "why has he no lace upon his coat; why doesn't
he wear a sword and look smart like M. Larochejaquelin? At any rate he is a very shabby general."

"He has a terrible long nose too," said another girl. "And he has not a morsel of starch in
his shirt ruffles, I declare," said a third, who officiated as laundress to the Mayor of Echanbroignes.

"I'm sure the republicans will never be afraid of such a general as he is. You are joking with
us now, Jacques. I am sure he is not a general; he is more like a grocer from Nantes."

"And is not Cathelineau like a postilion?" said Jacques, "and I hope you will allow he is a
great soldier. You know nothing of these things yet, Annot. M. Larochejaquelin is so smart
because he is a young nobleman; not because he is a general."

"And is not M. d'Elbee a nobleman?" said one of the girls.

"Not a bit of it," said Chapeau.

"Well, I think the generals should all be noblemen; I declare," said the laundress, "M. Larochejaquelin
did look so nice last Wednesday, when he was getting off his horse."

"That is all; but Cathelineau," said Annot, "he is the finest fellow of them all. I'd sooner
have Cathelinean for my lover, than the Duc de Chartres, and he's the king's cousin."

"You are a foolish girl, Annot," said Chapeau. "You might as well want the picture of St. John
out of the church window down yonder, and take that for your lover, as Cathelineau. Don't you
know he's the Saint of Anjou?"

"He might marry a wife, and have a house full of children, for all that; that's the difference
between being a saint and a priest; there's no harm in being in love with a saint, and I am
very much in love with Cathelineau."

"Why, you little ninny, you never saw him," said Chapean.

"No matter," said Annot; "ninny, or no ninny, I'll go where I'm like to see him; and I'm sure
I'll never bear the sight of another man afterwards; the dear, good, sweet Cathelineau, with
his curly hair, and fine whiskers, and black bright eyes; he's better than all the noblemen:
I declare I dreamed of him these last two nights."

Chapeau left the side of his mistress, muttering something about stupid foolish chits of girls,
and continued his description of M. d'Elbee to the men.

"Indeed he is a very great general. I don't know very well where he came from, but I believe
somewhere down in the Marais, from his being such a friend of M. Charette; but he has been
fighting against the republicans this long time, even before Cathelineau began, I believe,
though I don't exactly know where. I know he was made a prisoner in Paris, and nearly killed
there by some of those bloody-minded rebels; then he escaped, and he was at the siege of Machecoult,
and got honourably wounded, and was left for dead: and then he was at Thouars--no, not at Thouars;
we heard he was coming, but he didn't come; but he was at Fontenay, and that's where I first
saw him. M. Bonchamps brought him in and introduced him to M. de Lescure, and our M. Larochejaquelin,
and I was astonished to see how much they made of him, for he was dressed just as he is now,
and had no sword or anything. Well, as soon as he came in they all went to work talking, and
settling how Fontenay was to be attacked, for though its a little place, and not walled and
fortified like Saumur, we had a deal of trouble with it; but before a word was spoken, M. d'Elbee
stood up and said, 'Brethren,' said he, 'let us ask the assistance of our Saviour:' so down
they went on their knees, and he said an awful long prayer, for all the world like a priest.
And then again before we fired a shot, he bade all the soldiers kneel down, and down we went,
the republicans firing at us all the time. The soldiers call him Old Providence, for they say
he talks a deal about Providence when he is fighting."

"You may be sure that's what makes Father Jerome so fond of him," said Jean. "I knew he was
a good man."

"And he was a desperate fellow to fight afterwards," continued Chapeau. "But he walked into
the thick of the fighting just as he is now."

"But he had a sword, or a gun, or a spear?" said Jean.

"Neither the one or the other; he was just as he is this minute, giving orders, and directing
some of the men there who knew him well. Presently, he said to a young gentleman who was near
him: 'Lend me that sword a moment, will you?' and he took it out of his hands, and made a rush
through the gate of Fontenay, and I saw no more of him that day."

"Why did you not rush after him, then, M. Chapeau?"

"Rush after him! Why, you simpleton; do you think in wars like that every man is to rush just
where he pleases; you'll soon be taught the difference. M. d'Elbee was a general, and might
go where he liked; but I was a corporal under M. Henri, with ten men under me. We had to remain
where we were, and cut off the republicans, if they showed their noses at a point in the street
which we covered; it's only the generals that go rushing about in that way. But here we are
at Father Jerome's altar. Well; I'm very hot. I'm sure its nearly half a league up here from
the church."

They had now come to a rude altar, constructed on a piece of rock, in front of which was a
small space of green turf: the whole spot was closely surrounded by beech and ash-trees; so
closely, indeed, that the sun hardly made its way into it, and the rocks around it rising up
through the grass afforded ample accommodation for the people. In a moment, they were on their
knees on the grass; some almost immediately before the altar; others kneeling against the rocks;
others again with their heads and hands resting against the trunk of a huge beech-tree.

Hither had been brought the necessary appurtenances for the performance of mass. A small, but
beautifully white cloth was spread upon a flat portion of the rock; bread was there, and a
small quantum of wine; a little patina and a humble chalice. M. d'Elbee took his place among
the crowd before the altar, and Father Jerome, having dressed himself in his robes, performed,
with a fine, full, sonorous voice, the morning service of his church. When so occupied, he
had no longer the look of the banished priest: his sacred vestments had not shared the decay
which had fallen on his ordinary clothes. No bishop rising from his throne to bless the congregation
assembled in his cathedral, could assume more dignity, or inspire more solemnity than the Cure
of St. Laud, as he performed mass at his sylvan altar in La Vendee.

After mass was finished, the priest gave them an extempore discourse on the necessity of their
absolutely submitting themselves to their teachers, spiritual masters, and pastors; and before
he had finished, he turned their attention to the especial necessity of their obeying the leaders,
now among them, in carrying on the war against the Republic, and as he concluded, he said:

"I rejoice at all times, my children, that you are an obedient and a docile people, content
to accept the word of God from those whom he has sent to teach it to you--that you are not
a stiff-necked generation, prone to follow your own vain conceits, or foolish enough to conceive
that your little earthly knowledge can be superior to the wisdom which comes from above, as
others are. I have always rejoiced at this, my children, for in it I have seen hope for you,
when I could see none for others; but now also I rejoice greatly to see that you unite the
courage of men to the docility of babes. Hitherto your lot has been that of peace, and if you
have not enjoyed riches, you have at any rate been contented: another destiny is before you
now--peace and content have left the country, and have been followed by robbery, confusion,
and war. My children, you must, for a while, give over your accustomed peaceful duties; your
hands--your hearts--all your energy, and all your courage, are required by God for his own
purposes--yes, required by that Creator who gave you strength and energy--who gave you the
power and the will to do great deeds for His holy name.

"His enemies are in the land: impious wretches--who do not hesitate to wage war against His
throne--are endeavouring to destroy all that is good, and all that is holy in France. Do you
not know, my children, that they have murdered your King?--and that they have imprisoned your
Queen, and her son, who is now your King? Would you be content to remain quiet in your homes,
while your King is lying in a prison, in hourly danger of death? They have excluded you from
your churches, they have caused God's holy houses to be closed; they have sent among you teachers
who can only lead you astray--whose teaching can only bring you to the gates of hell. The enemies
of the Lord are around you; and you are now required to take arms in your hands, to go out
against them, and if needs be to give your blood--nay your life for your country, your King,
and your Church.

"I greatly rejoice, my children, that you are an obedient people; I know that you will now
do your utmost, and I know that you will succeed. The Lord will not desert His people when
they combat for His glory, when they faithfully turn to Him for victory. You have been taught
how He chose the Israelites as an especial people--how He loved and favoured them: as long
as they were faithful and obedient He never deserted them. They conquered hosts ten times their
numbers--they were victorious against armed warriors, and mighty giants. The Lord blinded their
enemies so that they saw not; He blunted their weapons; He paralyzed their courage; chariots
and horses did not avail them; nor strong walls, nor mighty men of battle. The Lord loved the
Israelites, and as long as they were faithful and obedient, they prevailed against all their
enemies.

"You, my children, are now God's people; if you are truly faithful, you shall assuredly prevail;
if you go out to battle firmly, absolutely, entirely trusting in the strength of His right
hand--that right hand, that Almighty arm shall be on your side. And who then shall stand against
you?--though tens, and hundreds of thousands swarm around you, they shall yield before you--they
shall fall before you as the giant Goliath fell before the shepherd David.

"Be not afraid, therefore, my children: we will go together; we will remember that every man
who falls on our side in this holy war, falls as he is doing Christ's service, and that his
death is to be envied, for it is a passport into Heaven. We will remember this in the hour
of battle, when our enemies are before us, when death is staring us in the face, and remembering
it, we shall not be afraid. If we die fighting truly in this cause, our immortal souls will
be wafted off to paradise-- to everlasting joy: if we live, it will be to receive, here in
our own dear fields, the thanks of a grateful King, to feel that we have done our duty as Christians
and as men, and to hear our children bless the days, when the courage of La Vendee restored
the honour of France."

Father Jerome's exhortation had a strong effect upon the people; he knew and calculated their
strength and their weakness--they were brave and credulous, and when he finished speaking,
there was hardly one there who in the least doubted that the event of the war would be entirely
successful: they felt that they were a chosen people, set apart for a good work--that glory
and victory awaited them in the contest, and especially that they were about to fight under
the immediate protection of the Almighty.

As soon as the service was over, they all left the little sylvan chapel by different paths,
and in different directions; some went back to the church, some went off across the fields,
some took a short cut to the road, but they all returned home without delay. Every man was
to set out early on the morrow for the rendezvous, and the women were preparing to shed their
tears and say their last farewell to their lovers, brothers, and husbands, before they started
on so great an enterprise. They had all been gay enough during the morning--they became a little
melancholy on their return home, but before the evening was far advanced, nothing was to be
heard but sobs and vows, kisses and blessings.

Jacques Chapeau returned to Echanbroignes with the party of villagers who had gone from thence
to hear Father Jerome, but he did not attach himself expressly to Annot, indeed he said not
a word to her on the way, but addressed the benefit of his conversation to his male friends
generally; to tell the truth, he was something offended at the warm admiration which his sweetheart
had expressed for Cathelineau. He wasn't exactly jealous of the postillion, for Annot had never
seen him, and couldn't, therefore, really love him; but he felt that she ought not to have
talked about another man's eyes and whiskers, even though that other man was a saint and a
general. It was heartless, too, of Annot to say such things at such a time, just as he was
going to leave her, on the eve of battle, and when he had left his own master, and all the
glorious confusion and good living in--at Durbelliere, merely that he might spend his last
quiet day in her company.

It was base of her to say that she had dreamed twice of Cathelineau; and she was punished for
it, for she had to walk home almost unnoticed. At first she was very angry, and kicked up the
dust with her Sunday shoes in fine style; but before long her heart softened, and she watched
anxiously for some word or look from Jacques on which she might base an attempt at a reconciliation.
Jacques knew what she was about, and would not even look at her: he went on talking with Jean
and Peter and the others, about the wars, and republicans and royalists, as though poor Annot
Stein had not been there at all. From the chapel of St. Laud to the village of Echanbroignes,
he did not speak a word to her, and when the four entered the old smith's house, poor Annot
was bursting with anger, and melting with love; she could not settle with herself whether he
hated Chapeau or loved him most; she felt that she would have liked to poison him, only she
knew that she could not live without him.

She hurried into her little sleeping place, and had a long debate with herself whether she
should instantly go to bed and pray that Jacques might be killed at Saumur, or whether she
should array herself in all her charms, and literally dazzle her lover into fondness and obedience
by her beauty and graces--after many tears the latter alternative was decided on.

It was a lovely summer evening, and at about eight o'clock hardly a person in the whole village
was to be found within doors; the elderly were sitting smoking at their doors, husbands were
saying a thousand last words to their weeping wives, young men were sharpening their swords,
and preparing their little kit for the morrow's march, and the girls were helping them; but
everything was done in the open air. Jean and Peter Stein were secretly preparing for a stolen
march to Saumur; for their father was still inexorable, and they were determined not to be
left behind when all the world was fighting for glory. Old Michael was smoking at his ease,
and Jacques was standing talking to him, wondering in his heart whether Annot could be really
angry with him, when that young lady reappeared in the kitchen.

"Where have you been, Annot?" said Michael Stein, "you didn't get your supper, yet child."

"I was sick with the heat, father; walking home from St. Laud's."

"I would not have you sick tonight, Annot, and our friends leaving us before sun-rise tomorrow.
Here is M. Chapeau complaining you are a bad hostess."

"M. Chapeau has enough to think of tonight, without my teasing him," said Annot; "great soldiers
like him have not time to talk to silly girls. I will walk across the green to Dame Rouel's,
father; I shall be back before sunset."

And Annot went out across the green, at the corner of which stood the smith's forge. Jacques
Chapeau was not slow to follow her, and Dame Rouel did not see much of either of them that evening.

"Annot," said Jacques, calling to his sweetheart, who perseveringly looked straight before
her, determined not to know that she was followed. "Annot, stop awhile. You are not in such
a hurry, are you, to see Dame Rouel?"

"Ah, M. Chapeau, is that you?--in a hurry to see Dame Rouel. No--I'm in no particular hurry."

"Will you take a turn down to the mill, then, Annot? Heaven knows when you and I may walk to
the old mill again; it may be long enough before I see Echanbroignes again."

Annot made no answer, but she turned into the little path which led through the fields to the mill.

"I suppose it may," said she, determined, if possible, that the amende should be made by Jacques
and not by herself.

"I see you are indifferent about that," said Jacques, with a soft and sentimental look, which
nearly melted Annot; "well, when you hear of my death, you will sometimes think of me, will
you not?"

"Oh, I will, M. Chapeau! Of course I'll think of you, and of all my friends."

Jacques walked on a few minutes or two in silence, cutting off the heads of the blue-bells
with his little cane. "I am not different to you then from any one else, eh, Annot?" said he.

"How different, M. Chapeau?"

"You will think as much of young Boullin, the baker?"

"I don't like young Boullin, the baker, and I don't thank you for mentioning his name one bit."

"Well! people say you are very partial to young Boullin."

"People lie--they always do; everybody tries to tease and plague me now. You and Jean, and
father, and that old fool, Rouel, are all alike," and Annot gave symptoms of hysterical tears.

Jacques was again silent for awhile, but he had commenced walking very near to his companion,
and she did not appear to resent it. After a while he said: "You are not glad that I'm going,
Annot?"

"You would not have me sorry that you are going to fight with all the other brave men, would you?"

"Is that all I am to get from you, after all? is that all the regard you have for me? very
well, Annot--it is well at any rate we should understand each other. They were right, I find,
when they told me that you were such a coquette, you would have a dozen lovers at the same time."

"And they were right, I find, when they told me you were too fond of yourself ever to love
any girl truly."

"Oh, Annot! and is it come to this? I'm sorry I ever came to Echanbroignes. I'm sorry I ever
saw you."

"And if you are, M. Chapeau, I'm sure I'm sorry enough I ever saw you;" and Annot again increased
the distance between her and her lover.

They walked on from hence in silence till they came to the little mill, and each stood gazing
on the stream, which ran gurgling down beneath the ash and willow-trees, which dipped their
boughs in its waters.

"How kind you were, the last time we were here together," said Jacques; "how kind and generous
you were then; you are very different now."

"And you are very different, too, M. Chapeau; much more different than I am; it's all your
own fault; you choose to give yourself airs, and I won't put up with it, and I believe we may
as well part."

"Give myself airs! No; but it's you give yourself airs, and say things which cut me to the
heart--things which I can't bear; and, therefore, perhaps, we may as well part :" and Jacques
assumed a most melancholy aspect, as he added, "So, good bye, Annot; there's my hand. I wouldn't,
at any rate, part anything but friends after all."

"Good bye," said poor Annot, putting out her hand to her lover, and sobbing violently. "Good
bye; I'm sure I never thought it would come to this. I'm sure I gave up everybody and everything
for your sake."

"Well; and didn't I give up everybody, too. Haven't I come all the way over here week after
week, when people wondered what made me leave Durbelliere so much; and wasn't it all for love
of you? Oh, Annot! Annot!" and even the manly dignity of M. Chapeau succumbed to tears.

"It's no good talking," said she, greatly softened; "for you can't have loved me, and treated
me as you did this day, letting me walk all alone from St. Laud, without so much as a word
or a look; and that before all the people: and I that went merely to walk back with you. Oh!
I could have died on the roadside to find myself treated in such a way."

"And what must I have felt to hear you talking as you did before them all? Do you think I felt
nothing?"

"Talking, Jacques; what talk?"

"Why; saying that you loved Cathelineau better than any one. That he was the only man you admired;
that you dreamed of him always, and I don't know how much more about his eyes and whiskers."

"Why now, Jacques; you don't mean to be jealous?"

"Jealous; no I'm not jealous."

"Jealous of a man you know I never saw," said Annot, smiling through her tears.

"Jealous. No, I tell you I'm not jealous; but still, one doesn't like to hear one's mistress
talking of another man's eyes, and whiskers, and those sort of things; no man would like it,
Annot; though I care about it as little myself as any man."

"But don't you know Cathelineau is a saint, Jacques?"

"Oh! but you said saints might marry, and have a lot of children, and so they may."

"But I never saw Cathelineau, Jacques," and she put her hand upon his arm.

And you are not in love with him, Annot?"

"How can I be in love with a man I never put eyes on?"

"And you won't say again, that you'd like to have him for a lover?"

"That was only my little joke, Jacques. Surely, a girl may joke sometimes."

"And you do love me, don't you?" and Jacques now got very close to his mistress.

"Ah! but why did you let me walk home all the way by myself? You know I love you dearly; but
you must beg my pardon for that, before I'll ever tell you so again."

And Jacques did beg her pardon in a manner of his own twenty times, sitting by the gurgling
mill-stream, and to tell the truth Annot seemed well pleased with the way in which he did it;
and then when the fountain of her love was opened, and the sluice gate of her displeasure removed,
she told him how she would pray for him till he came back safe from the wars; how she would
never speak a word to mortal man in the way of courting, till he came back to make her his
wife; how she would grieve, should he be wounded; how she would die, should he be killed in
battle: and then she gave him a little charm, which she had worked for him, and put it round
his neck, and told him she had taken it with her to St. Laud, to give it him there beneath
the cross, only he had gone away from her, so that she couldn't do so: and then Jacques begged
pardon again and again in his own queer way; and then, having sat there by the mill-stream
till the last red streak of sunlight was gone, they returned home to the village, and Annot
told her father that Dame Rouel had been so very pressing, she had made them stay there to
eat bread and cheese. And so Annot, at last, went to bed without her supper, and dreamed not
of Cathelineau, but of her own lover, Jacques Chapeau.

CHAPTER VIII

AGATHA LAROCHEJAQUELIN.

As Chapeau had said, great preparations were made at Durbelliere for the coming campaign. The
old Marquis had joined with his son in furnishing everything which their limited means would
admit of, for the wants of the royalists. Durbelliere had become quite a depot; the large granaries
at the top of the house were no longer empty; they were stored with sacks of meal, with pikes
and muskets, and with shoes for the soldiers. Agatha's own room looked like an apartment in
a hospital; it was filled with lint, salves, and ointments, to give ease to those whom the
wars should send home wounded; all the contents of the cellars were sacrificed; wine, beer,
and brandy, were alike given up to aid the spirits of the combatants; the cattle were drawn
in from the farms, and kept round the house in out-houses and barns, ready to be slaughtered,
as occasion might require, an abattoir was formed in the stable yard, and a butcher kept in
regular employment; a huge oven was built in an outhouse attached to the stables, and here
bakers, from neighbouring parishes, were continually kept at work: they neither expected, or
received wages; they, and all the others employed got their meals in the large kitchen of the
chateau, and were content to give their work to the cause without fee or reward. Provisions,
cattle, and implements, were also sent from M. de Lescure's house to Durbelliere, as it was
considered to be more central, and as it was supposed that there were still some republicans
in the neighbourhood of Bressuire, whereas, it was well known that there were none in the rural
districts; the more respectable of the farmers also, and other country gentlemen sent something;
and oxen, sheep, and loads of meal; jars of oil, and casks of wine were coming in during the
whole week before the siege of Saumur, and the same horses took them out again in the shape
of bread, meat, and rations, to the different points where they would be required.

As soon as M. de Lescure had left home, on his recruiting service in the south of La Vendee,
the ladies of his house went over to Durbelliere, to remain there till Henri Larochejaquelin
should start for Saumur, and give their aid to Agatha in all her work. Adolphe Denot was also
there: he, too, had been diligently employed in collecting the different sinews of wars; and
as far as his own means went had certainly not begrudged them. There was still an unhappy air
of dissatisfaction about him, which was not to be observed with any one else: his position
did not content his vanity; the people did not talk of him as they did of Cathelineau, and
Henri Larochejaquelin; he heard nothing of La Vendee relying on his efforts; the nanes of various
men were mentioned as trustworthy leaders, but his own was never among them. De Lescure, Charette,
d'Elbee, Stofflet, were all talked of; and what had they done more than he had; or what, indeed,
so much: the two latter were men of low origin, who had merely shown courage in the time of
need: indeed, what more had Cathelineau done; whereas, he had never failed in courage, and
had given, moreover, his money, and his property; yet he felt that he was looked on as a nobody.
Jacques Chapeau was almost of more importance.

And then, again, his love for Agatha tormented him. He had thought to pique her by a show of
indifference himself, but he found that this plan did not answer: it was evident, even to him,
that Agatha was not vexed by his silence, his altered demeanour, and sudden departure. He had
miscalculated her character, and now found that he must use other means to rouse the affection
in her heart, without which he felt, at present, that he could not live happily. He thought
that she could not have seen with indifference the efforts he was making in the cause which
she loved so well; and he determined to throw himself at her feet before he started for Saumur,
and implore her to give him a place in her affections, while her heart was softened by the
emotions, which the departure of so many of her friends, on the eve of battle, would occasion.

Agatha had had but little conversation with him since his last arrival at Durbelliere, but
still she felt that he was about to propose to her. She shunned him as much as she could; she
scrupulously avoided the opportunity which he anxiously sought; she never allowed herself to
be alone with him; but she was nevertheless sure the evil hour would come; she saw it in his
eye as they sat together at their meals--she heard it in the tones of his voice every time
he spoke. She knew from his manner that he was preparing himself for the interview, and she
also knew that he would not submit tamely to the only answer she could bring herself to give him.

"Marie," said she to her cousin, on the Saturday evening, "I am in the greatest distress, pray
help me, dearest. I am sure you know what ails me."

"In distress, Agatha, and wanting help from me!--you that are wont to help all the world yourself!
But I know, from your face, you are only half in earnest."

"Indeed, and indeed, I never was much more so. I never was more truly in want of council. Can
you not guess what my sorrow is?"

"Not unless it is, that you have a lover too much?--or perhaps you find the baker's yeast runs
short?"

"Ah, Marie, will you always joke when I am serious!"

"Well then, Agatha, now I am serious--is it that you have a lover too much?"

"Can any trouble be more grievous?"

"Oh, dear, yes! ten times worse. My case is ten times worse: and alas, alas! there is no cure
for that."

"Your case, Marie?"

"Yes, my case, Agatha--a lover too few!"

"Ah, Marie, do not joke with me tonight. I want your common sense, and not your wit, just now.
Be a good, dear girl, and tell me what I shall say to him. I know he will not go to Saumur
before--before he has proposed to me."

"Then, in the name of common sense, dear Agatha, tell him the truth, whatever it may be."

"You know I do not--cannot love him."

"Nay, I know nothing. You have not said yet who 'him' is--but I own I can give a guess. I suppose
poor Adolphe Denot is the man you cannot love? Poor Adolphe! he must be told so, that is all."

"But how shall I tell him, Marie? He is so unlike other men. Henri is his friend, and yet he
has never spoken to him about me, nor to my father. If he would ask my hand from Henri, as
another would, Henri would talk to him, and explain to him that it could not be-that my heart
is too much occupied with other cares, to care for loving or being loved."

"That means, Agatha, till the right lover comes."

"No, Marie; but till these wars are over. Not that I could ever love Adolphe Denot; but now,
at present, methinks love should be banished from the country, and not allowed to return till
the King is on his throne again."

"Well, Agatha, I don't know. That would be somewhat hard upon us poor girls, whose lovers are
more to our taste, than M. Denot is to yours. I know not that our knights will fight the worse
for a few stray smiles, though the times be so frightful."

"Do you smile on yours then, Marie; and I will smile to see you happy. But tell me, dearest,
what shall I say to Adolphe? You would not have me give him hope, when I feel I can never love
him?"

"God forbid!--why should you? But has he never spoken to Henri on the subject, or to the Marquis?"

"Never a word. I'm sure he never spoke of it to my father, and Henri told me that he had never
said a word to him."

"Then you have spoken to your brother on the subject? And what did he say?"

"He said just what a dear, good brother should have said. He said he was sorry for his friend,
but that on no account whatever would he sacrifice his sister's happiness."

"M. Larochejaquelin always does just what he ought to do. He is as good and kind to you as
Charles is to me."

"Henri and I are so nearly of an age; we were always companions together. I do not think any
lover will be agreeable to me as long as he is with me."

"But if he should take a love of his own, Agatha? It wont do, you know, for sisters to monopolize
their brothers; or what shall we spinters do?"

"He shall bring his love here, and she shall be my own sister. If he makes the choice I think
he will, I shall not have to open a new place in my heart for her, shall I, Marie?"

"Nay, I know not. Now it is you that wander from the subject."

"And it is cruel in you to bring me back to it. If he proposes to me tomorrow, Marie, what
shall I say to him?"

"Keep out of his way tomorrow. He goes on Monday morning."

"It is very well to say, 'Keep out of his way;' but if he formally demands an interview, I
cannot refuse it."

"If he formally desires an interview, do you give him a formal reception: if he formally offers
you his hand, do you formally decline the honour."

"I would it were you, Marie, that he loved."

"A thousand thanks to you, Mademoiselle Larochejaquelin. I appreciate your generosity, but
really I have no vacancy for M. Denot, just at present."

"Ah! but you would reject him with so much more ease, than I can do it."

"Practice, my dear, is everything: this time you may feel a little awkward, but you will find
you will dispose of your second lover without much difficulty, and you will give his conge
to your third with as much ease, as though you were merely dismissing a disobedient kitchen-maid."

"I cannot bear to give pain; and Adolphe will be pained; his self-love will be wounded at the
idea of being rejected."

"Then spare his self-love, and accept him."

"No; that I will not do."

"Then wound his self-love, and reject him."

"Would I could do the one without the other; would I could persuade him I was not worthy of him."

"Nay, do not attempt that; that will be direct encouragement."

"I will tell him that I am averse to marriage; in truth, that will be no falsehood. I do not
think that my heart is capable of more love than it feels at present."

"That may be true now, Agatha; but suppose your heart should enlarge before the autumn, at
the touch of some gallant wizard--take my advice, dear girl, make no rash promises."

"I will tell him that I cannot think of love till the King is on the throne once more."

"If you say so, he will promise valiantly to restore His Majesty, and then to return to you
to look for his reward. Shall I tell you, Agatha, what I should say?"

"Do, dearest Marie: tell me in sober earnest; and if there be ought of sobriety mixed with
your wit, I will take your advice."

"I would say to him thus: 'M. Denot,' or 'Adolphe,' just as your custom is to address him--but
mind, mark you, make him speak out firmly and formally first, that your answer may be equally
firm and formal. 'M. Denot, you have paid me the greatest honour which a gentleman can pay
a lady, and I am most grateful for the good opinion which you have expressed. I should be ungrateful
were I to leave you for one moment in doubt as to my real sentiments: I cannot love you as
I ought to love my husband. I hope you will never doubt my true friendship for you; but more
than sincere friendship I cannot give you.' There, Agatha, not a word more, nor a word less
than that; sit quite straight on your chair, as though you were nailed to it; do not look to
the right or to the left; do not frown or smile."

"There will not be the least danger of my smiling, Marie."

"But do not frown neither; fancy that you are the district judge, giving sentence on a knotty
piece of law; show neither sentiment, pride, nor anger. Be quite cold, inflexible and determined;
and, above all things, do not move from your seat; and I think you will find your lover will
take his answer: but if he do not--repeat it all over again, with a little more emphasis, and
rather slower than before. If it be necessary, you may repeat it a third time, or indeed till
he goes away, but never vary the words. He must be a most determined man if he requires the
third dose. I never heard of but one who wasn't satisfied with the second, and he was an Irishman."

"If I could only insist on his sitting still and silent to hear me make my formidable speech,
your advice might be very good."

"That, my dear, is your own strong point: if he attempts to interrupt you, hear what he says,
and then begin again. By the time you have got to your 'real sentiments,' I doubt not he will
be in his tantrums: but do you not get into tantrums too, or else you are as good as lost;
let nothing tempt you to put in an unpremeditated word; one word might be fatal; but, above
all, do not move; nothing but an awful degree of calm on your part will frighten him into quiescence:
if you once but move, you will find M. Denot at your feet, and your hand pressed to his lips.
You might as well have surrendered at once, if anything like that occur."

"Well, Marie, let what will happen, at any rate I will not surrender, as you call it. As to
sitting like the district judge, and pronouncing sentence on my lover as you advise--I fear
I lack the nerve for it."

Agatha was quite right in her forebodings. Adolphe Denot had firmly made up his mind to learn
his fate before he started for Saumur, and immediately on rising from breakfast, he whispered
to Agatha that he wished to speak to her alone for a moment. In her despair she proposed that
he should wait till after mass, and Adolphe consented; but during the whole morning she felt
how weak she had been in postponing the evil hour; she had a thousand last things to do for
her brother, a thousand last words to say to him; but she was fit neither to do nor to say
anything; even her prayers were disturbed; in spite of herself her thoughts clung to the interview
which she had to go through.

Since the constitutional priests had been sent into the country, and the old Cures silenced,
a little temporary chapel had been fitted up in the chateau at Durbelliere, and here the former
parish priest officiated every Sunday; the peasants of the parish of St. Aubin were allowed
to come to this little chapel; at first a few only had attended, but the number had increased
by degrees, and at the time when the revolt commenced, the greater portion of the pastor's
old flock crowded into or round the chateau every Sunday; so that the Sabbath morning at Durbelliere
was rather a noisy time. This was especially the case on the 6th of June, as the people had
so much to talk about, and most of the men wished to see either the old or the young master,
and most of the women wanted to speak to one of the ladies; by degrees, however, the chateau
was cleared, and Agatha with a trembling heart retreated to her own little sitting-room upstairs
to keep her appointment with Adolphe Denot.

She had not been long there, when Adolphe knocked at the door: he had been there scores of
times before, and had never knocked; but, although he was going to propose to make Agatha his
wife, he felt that he could no longer treat her, with his accustomed familiarity.

He entered the room and found Agatha seated; so far she had taken her friend's advice; she
was very pale, but still she looked calm and dignified, and was certainly much less confused
than her lover.

"Agatha," said he, having walked up to the fire-place, and leaning with his arm upon the mantle-piece,
"Agatha, tomorrow I start for Saumur."

He was dressed very point-de-vice; the frills of his shirt were most accurately starched; his
long black hair was most scrupulously brushed; his hands were most delicately white; his boots
most brilliantly polished; he appeared more fit to adorn the salon of an ambassador, than to
take a place as a warrior beneath the walls of a besieged town. Adolphe was always particular
in his dress, but he now exceeded himself; and he appeared to be the more singular in this
respect at Durbelliere just at present, as the whole of the party except himself women included,
had forgotten or laid aside, as unimportant, the usual cares of the toilet.

"You, at any rate, go in good company, Adolphe," said Agatha, attempting to smile. "May you
all be successful, and return as heroes--heroes, indeed, you are already; but may you gather
fresh laurels at Saumur. I am sure you will. I, for one, am not in the least despondent."

"Yes, Agatha, I shall go to Saumur, determined at any rate not to lose there any little honour
I may yet have won. If I cannot place the white flag of La Vendee on the citadel of Saumur,
I will at any rate fall in attempting it."

"I am very sure, that if you fail, it will not be for lack of courage, or of resolution. You
and Henri, and M. de Lescure and our good friend Cathelineau, have taught us to expect victory
as the sure result of your attempts."

"Ah! Agatha, one word from your lips, such as I long to hear, would make me feel that I could
chain victory to my sword, and rush into the midst of battle panoplied against every harm."

"Your duty to your King should be your best assurance of victory; your trust in your Saviour,
your panoply against harm; if these did not avail you, as I know they do, the vain word of
a woman would be of little service."

"You speak coldly, Agatha, and you look coldly on me. I trust your feelings are not cold also."

"I should have hoped that many years of very intimate acquaintance between us, of friendship
commenced in childhood, and now cemented by common sympathies and common dangers, would have
made you aware that my feelings are not cold towards you."

"Oh no! not cold in the ordinary sense. You wish me well, I doubt not, and your kind heart
would grieve, if you heard that I had fallen beneath the swords of the republicans; but you
would do the same for Cathelineau or M. de Bonchamps. If I cannot wake a warmer interest in
your heart than that, I should prefer that you should forget me altogether."

Agatha began to fear that at this rate the interview would have no end. If Adolphe remained
with his arm on the marble slab, and his head on one side, making sentimental speeches, till
she should give him encouragement to fall at her feet, it certainly would not be ended by bed-time.
She, therefore, summoned all her courage, and said,

"When you asked me to meet you here, your purpose was not to reproach me with coldness--was
it Adolphe? Perhaps it will be better for both of us that this interview should terminate now.
We shall part friends, dear friends; and I will rejoice at your triumphs, when you are victorious;
and will lament at your reverses, should you be unlucky. I shall do the same for my own dear
Henri, and I know that you two will not be separated. There is my hand," she added, thinking
that he appeared to hesitate; "and now let us go down to our friends, who are expecting us."

"Are you so soon weary of hearing the few words I wish to say to you?" said Adolphe, who had
taken her hand, and who seemed inclined to keep it.

"No, I am not weary. I will hear anything you wish to say." And Agatha having withdrawn her
hand, sat down, and again found herself in a position to take advantage of Marie's good advice.

Adolphe remained silent for a minute or two, with his head supported on his hand, and gazing
on the lady of his love with a look that was intended to fascinate her. Agatha sat perfectly
still; she was evidently mindful of the lesson she had received: at last, Adolphe started up
from his position, walked a step or two into the middle of the room, thrust his right hand
into his bosom; and said abruptly, "Agatha, this is child's play; we are deceiving each other;
we are deceiving ourselves; we would appear to be calm when there is no calm within us."

"Do not say we. I am not deceiving myself; I trust I am not deceiving you."

"And is your heart really so tranquil?" said he. "Does that fair bosom control no emotion?
Is that lovely face, so exquisitely pale, a true index of the spirit within? Oh! Agatha! it
cannot be; while my own heart is so torn with love; while I feel my own pulses beat so strongly;
while my own brain burns so fiercely, I cannot believe that your bosom is a stranger to all
emotion! Some passion akin to humanity must make you feel that you are not all divine! Speak,
Agatha; if that lovely form has within it ought that partakes of the weakness of a woman, tell
me, that at some future time you will accept the love I offer you; tell me, that I may live
in hope. Oh, Agatha! bid me not despair," and M. Denot in bodily reality fell prostrate at
her feet.

When Agatha had gone up to her room, she had prepared herself for a most disagreeable interview,
but she had not expected anything so really dreadful as this. Adolphe had not contented himself
with kneeling at her feet on one knee, and keeping his head erect in the method usual in such
cases; but he had gone down upon both knees, had thrown his head upon her feet, and was now
embracing her shoes and stockings in a very vehement manner; her legs were literally caught
in a trap; she couldn't move them; and Adolphe was sobbing so loudly that it was difficult
to make him hear anything.

"Adolphe, Adolphe, get up!" she almost screamed, "this is ridiculous in the extreme; if you
will not get up, I must really call for some one. I cannot allow you to remain there!"

"Oh, Agatha, Agatha!" sobbed Adolphe.

"Nonsense, Adolphe," said Agatha. "Are you a man, to lie grovelling on the floor like that?
Rise up, or you will lose my esteem for ever, if that be of any value to you."

"Give me one gleam of hope, and I will rise," said he, still remaining on his knees, but now
looking up into her face; "tell me not to despair, and I will then accomplish any feat of manhood.
Give me one look of comfort, and I will again be the warrior ready for the battle; it is you
only who can give me back my courage; it is you only who can restore to me the privilege of
standing erect before all mankind."

"I can tell you nothing, Adolphe, but this--that, if you continue on your knees, I shall despise
you; if you will rise, I will give you at any rate a reasonable answer."

"Despise me, Agatha! no, you cannot despise me; the unutterable burning love of a true heart
is not despicable; the character which I bear before mankind is not despicable. Man is not
despicable when he kneels before the object which he worships; and, Agatha, with all my heart,
I worship you!"

"Now you are profane as well as contemptible, and I shall leave you," and she walked towards
the door.

"Stay then," said he, "stay, and I will rise," and, suiting the action to the. word, he got
up. "Now speak to me in earnest, Agatha; and, since you will have it so, I also, if possible,
will be calm. Speak to me; but, unless you would have the misery of a disturbed spirit on your
conscience, bid me not despair!"

"Is that your calmness, Adolphe?"

"Can a man, rushing towards the brink of a precipice, be calm? Can a man be calm on the verge
of the grave? I love you, Agatha, with a true and holy love; but still with a love fierce and
untameable. You reviled me when I said I worshipped you, but I adore the ground you tread on,
and the air you breathe. I would shed my last drop of blood to bring you ease; but I could
not live and see you give that fair hand to another. My joy would be to remain ever as your
slave; but then the heart that beats beneath your bosom must be my own. Agatha, I await your
answer; one word from your lips can transport me to paradise!"

"If I am to understand that you are asking me for love--for a warmer love than that which always
accompanies true friendship--I am obliged to say that I cannot give it you." Adolphe remained
standing in the middle of the room, with his hand still fixed in his bosom, and with a look
intended to represent both thunder and lightning. He had really thought that the little scene
which he had gone through, very much to his own satisfaction, would have a strong effect on
Agatha, and he was somewhat staggered by the cool and positive tone of her reply. "It grieves
me that I should give you pain," she continued, "if my answer does pain you; but I should never
forgive myself, were I not to speak the truth to you plainly, and at once."

"And do you mean that for your final, and only answer to me?"

"Certainly, my only answer; for I can give you no other. I know you will be too kind, too sensible,
to make it necessary that I should repeat it."

"This is dreadful," said Denot, putting his hand to his brow, "this is very dreadful!" and
he commenced pacing up and down the room.

"Come," said she, good naturedly, "let us go down--let us forget this little episode--you have
so much of happiness, and of glory before you, that I should grieve to see you mar your career
by a hopeless passion. Take the true advice of a devoted friend," and she put her hand kindly
on his arm, "let us both forget this morning's scene--let us only remember our childhood's
friendship; think, Adolphe, how much you have to do for your King and your country, and do
hot damp your glorious exertion by fostering a silly passion. Am not I the same to you as a
sister? Wait till these wars are over, and then I will gather flowers for you to present to
some mistress who shall truly love you."

"No, Agatha, the flowers you gather for me shall never leave my own bosom. If it be the myrtle,
I will wear it with joy to my dying day, next my heart: if it is to be a cyprus branch, it
shall soon be laid with me in the tomb."

"You will think less sadly in a short time," said Agatha; "your spirits will recover their
proper tone amid the excitement of battle. We had better part now, Adolphe;" and she essayed
to leave the room, but he was now leaning against the door, and did not seem inclined to let
her depart so easily.

"You will not, I hope, begrudge me a few moments," said he, speaking between his teeth.

"You may reject me with scorn, but you can hardly refuse me the courtesy which any gentleman
would have a right to expect from your hands."

"You know that I will refuse you nothing which, either in courtesy or kindness, I can do for
you," said she, again sitting down. He, however, seeing her once more seated, did not appear
much inclined to conclude what he had to say to her, for he continued walking up and down the
room, in a rather disturbed manner; "but you should remember," she added, "how soon Henri is
going to leave me, and how much we have all to think and to talk of."

"I see my presence is unwelcome, and it shall not trouble you long. I would soon rid your eyes
of my hated form, but I must first say a few words, though my throat be choked with speaking
them. My passion for you is no idle boyish love; it has grown with my growth, and matured itself
with my manhood. I cannot now say to myself that it shall cease to be. I cannot restore calmness
to my heart or rest to my bosom. My love is a fire which cannot now be quenched; it must be
nourished, or it will destroy the heart which is unable to restrain it. Think, Agatha, of all
the misery you are inflicting; think also of the celestial joy one word of yours is capable
of giving."

"I have said before that I grieve to pain you; but I cannot speak a falsehood. Were it to save
us both from instant death, I could not say that I love you in the sense you mean."

"Oh, Agatha! I do not ask you to love me--that is not to love me now; if you will only say
that your heart is not for ever closed against my prayers, I will leave you contented."

"I can say nothing which would give you any hope of that which can never happen."

"And that is all I am to expect from you in return for as true a love as man ever bore to woman?"

"I cannot make you the return you wish. I can give you no other answer."

"Well, Agatha, so be it. You shall find now that I can be calm, when my unalterable resolve
requires it. You shall find that I am a man; at any rate, you shall not again have to tell
me that I am despicable," and he curled his upper lip, and showed his teeth in a very ferocious
manner. "You shall never repeat that word in regard to Adolphe Denot. Should kind fortune favour
my now dearest wish, you will soon hear that my bones are whitening under the walls of Saumur.
You will hear that your des-pi-ca-ble lover," and he hissed out the offending word, syllable
by syllable, between his closed teeth, "has perished in his attempt to be the first to place
the white flag of La Vendee above the tri-colour. If some friendly bullet will send me to my
quiet home, Adolphe Denot shall trouble you no longer," and as he spoke the last few words,
he softened his voice, and re-assumed his sentimental look; but he did not remain long in his
quiet mood, for he again became furious, as he added: "But if fortune should deny me this boon,
if I cannot find the death I go to seek, I swear by your own surpassing beauty, by your glorious
unequalled form, that I will not live without you. Death shall be welcome to me," and he raised
his hands to heaven, and then dashed them against his breast. "Oh! how dearly welcome! Yes,
heroic death upon the battlefield shall calm this beating heart--shall quell these agonized
pangs. Yes, Agatha, if fortune be but kind, death, cold death, shall soon relieve us both;
shall leave you free to bestow upon a colder suitor the prize you have refused to my hot, impatient
love; but if," (and here he glanced very wildly round him), "my prayers are not heard, if after
Saumur's field, life be still left within my body's sanctuary, I will return to seize you as
my own, though hosts in armour try to stop my way. I will not live without you. I will not
endure to see another man aspire to the hand which has been refused to me. Adieu, Agatha, adieu!
I trust we shall meet no more; in thinking of me, at any rate, your memory shall not call me
despicable," and he rushed out of the door and down stairs, without waiting to hear whether
Agatha intended making any answer to this poetical expression of his fixed resolution.

In the commencement of his final harangue, Agatha had determined to hear him quietly to the
end; but she had not expected anything so very mad as the exhibition he made. However, she
sat quietly through the whole of it, and was glad that she was spared the necessity of a reply.

Nothing more was seen of Adolphe Denot that night. Henri asked his sister whether she had seen
him, and she told him that he had made a declaration of love to her, and had expressed himself
ill-satisfied with the only answer she had been able to give him. She did not tell her brother
how like a demoniac his friend had behaved. To Marie she was more explicit; to her she repeated
as nearly as possible the whole scene as it had occurred; and although Agatha was almost weeping
with sorrow, there was so much that was ludicrous in the affair, that Marie could not keep
herself from laughing.

"He will trouble you no more," said she. "You will find that he will not return to Durbelliere
to carry you off through the armed hosts. He will go to England or emigrate; and in a few years'
time, when you meet him again, you will find him settled down, and as quiet as his neighbours.
He is like new-made wine, my dear--he only wants age."

On the following morning, by break of day, the party left Durbelliere, and Adolphe Denot joined
his friend on the gravelled ring before the house; and Agatha, who had been with her brother
in his room, looking from the widow saw her unmanageable lover mount his horse in a quiet,
decent way, like the rest of the party.

CHAPTER IX

LE MOUCHOIR ROUGE.

Nothing interfered to oppose the advance of the royalist troops towards Saumur. At Coron, as
had been proposed, Larochejaquelin and Denot joined Father Jerome; and Cathelineau also, and
M. d'Elbee joined them there. Every house in the town was open to them, and the provisions,
which by the care of M. de Larochejaquelin had been sent there, were almost unneeded. If there
was any remnant of republican feeling in Coron, at any rate it did not dare to shew itself.
The road which the royalists intended to take ran from Cholet, through Coron, Vihiers, and
Doue, to Saumur. The republicans, who were now in great force at Saumur, under Generals Coustard
and Quetineau, had sent small parties of soldiers into the town of Vihiers and Doue, the inhabitants
of which were mostly republican. Before the arrival of M. de Larochejaquelin, the blues, as
the republican troops were called by the Vendeans, had been driven out of Vihiers by a party
of royalists under the direction of Stofflet, who had raised himself to distinction soon after
the commencement of the revolt. This man was a gamekeeper in the employment of an emigrant
nobleman, and though he was a rough, harsh, uneducated, quarrelsome man, nevertheless, by his
zeal and courage, he had acquired great influence among the people, and was now at the head
of a numerous, and, for La Vendee, well-armed body of men.

Our friends accordingly found the road open for them as far as Doue. After their junction with
Stofflet, their army amounted to about 7,500 men; and at Done they were to meet M. Bonchamps
and M. de Lescure, who, it was supposed, would bring with them as many more. They marched out
of Vihiers early on the Tuesday morning, having remained there only about a couple of hours,
and before nightfall they saw the spire of Doue church. They then rested, intending to force
their way into the town early on the following morning; but they had barely commenced their
preparations for the evening, when a party of royalists came out to them from the town, inviting
them in. M. de Lescure and M. Bonchamps were already there. The republican soldiers had been
attacked and utterly routed; most of them were now prisoners in the town; those who had escaped
had retreated to Saumur, and even they had left their arms behind them.

All this good fortune greatly inspirited the Vendeans. The men talked with the utmost certainty
of what they would do when they were masters of Saumur. Cathelineau had brought with him the
celebrated cannon of St. Florent, 'Marie Jeanne,' and she now stood in the market place of
Done, covered with ribbons and flowers. Many of the men had never hitherto seen this wonderful
piece of artillery, and they hastened to look at it. 'Marie Jeanne' that night was patted,
kissed, and caressed by thousands. Cathelineau was equally the object of their admiration;
every peasant who had not yet seen him, hurried to gaze on him; and after his arrival in Doue,
he was two hours employed in a military operation, hitherto undertaken, I believe, by no other
general: he was endeavouring to shake hands with every man in the army. Chapeau here was again
of great use, for he stood at Cathelineau's elbow, and hurried the men away as soon as they
touched his hand. But for this precaution, the work could never have been done; and as it was,
some of the men were discontented, and declared their intention of returning home, for Cathelineau
was called away before he had completed his task: he was obliged to go the Town Hall to attend
a council that was held there of the different Vendean chiefs.

The arms which they had taken in Vihiers and Doue, were of the greatest use to them; in both
places they had found a cannon; they had taken nine or ten from Fontenay, and others from Thouars.
Most of the men among them now had muskets, and they were able to take to Saumur with them
twenty-four pieces of heavy artillery. What could the infamous blues expect to do against a
force so numerous, so well armed, and so well officered!

That evening a council of war was held by the different chiefs of the Vendeans in the Town
Hall of Doue. Lescure, Larochejaquelin, Cathelineau, d'Elbee, and Stofflet were there. M. Bonchamps,
who had been very severely wounded at Fontenay, but who had insisted on being carried along
with his own men, was brought in on a litter. Father Jerome was there, and another priest who
had come with M. Bonchamps. There were a couple of old royalist noblemen, not sufficiently
active to take a part in the actual fighting, but sufficiently zealous in the cause to leave
their homes for the purpose of giving the young commanders the benefit of their experience.
Foret also, Cathelineau's friend, was present, and Adolphe Denot: indeed many others, from
time to time, crowded into the room, for the door was not well kept, nor were the councils
of the generals in any way a secret. Jacques Chapeau, as a matter of course, managed to make
his way into the room, and took upon himself the duties of doorkeeper.

The Mayor's arm-chair stood at the head of the table, as the leaders dropped into the room
one after another, but no one appeared willing to occupy it. Hitherto there had been no chief
among the Vendeans; this was the first meeting which had been held with anything approaching
to the solemnity of a general assembly, and it occurred to each of them that whoever should
then seat himself in the Mayor's chair, would be assuming that he was the chief leader of the
revolt.

"Come, M. de Lescure," said Stofflet, "we have much to do, and but little time; let us make
the most of it: do you take the President's seat. Gentlemen, I am sure we could have no better
President than M. de Lescure?"

They all agreed, with the exception of the chosen leader. "By no means," said he. "I was the
last here who joined the cause, and I certainly will not place myself first among those who
have led the way in the work we have taken up. No; here is the man who shall be our President."
And as he spoke he caught hold of Cathelineau, who was immediately behind him, and absolutely
forced him into the chair.

"Indeed, indeed, M. de Lescure--" said Cathelineau, endeavouring to extricate himself from
the seat; but both his voice and his exertions were stopped, for three or four of them united
to hold him where he was, and declared that he should be the President for the evening.

"Indeed, and indeed you will not stir," said Henri, who stood behind his chair, and placed
his hands heavily on the postillion's shoulders.

"It was you that brought us here," said de Lescure, "and you must not now avoid the responsibility."

"Ah! M. de Lescure," said he, "there are so many more fitting than me."

"Not one in all La Vendee," said M. Bonchamps: "sit where you are, Cathelineau."

"You must do it, Cathelineau;" whispered his friend Foret; "the peasants would not endure to
see any man put above you."

"Cathelineau will not shrink from the burden which the Lord has called upon him to bear," said
Father Jerome.

"Providence," said d'Elbee, "has summoned the good Cathelineau to this high duty; he will not,
I am sure, oppose its decrees."

And thus Cathelineau found himself seated in the Mayor's chair at the head of the table, whilst
the highest noblemen and gentry of the country took their places around it, and from that moment
Cathelineau became the General-in-Chief of the Vendeans.

Each leader then gave in the numbers of the men who had come with him, and it was found that
the army consisted of above fifteen thousand men. Lists were then made out of the arms and
accoutrements which they possessed, and the men in a rude way were drafted into regiments under
the command of the leaders who had brought them. There was a small body of cavalry equipped
in most various manners, and mounted on horses, which resembled anything rather than a regular
squadron of troopers: these were under the immediate command of Henri Larochejaquelin.

"Gentlemen," said Cathelineau, "we have, you know, three different attacks to make, three positions
to carry, before we can be masters of Saumur."

"Yes," said Bonchamps, "there in the camp at Varin on the right, and the redoubts of Bournan
on the left; the fortifications of the town itself lie between them, and a little to the rear
of both."

"Exactly, M. Bonchamps; the town itself, I take, is the easiest task of the three; but as we
are situated it must be the last."

"I think you will find that Varin is their strongest point," said de Lescure.

"M. de Lescure is right," said Cathelineau. "We shall find them very strong in their camp.
I had with me, yesterday, two men from Saumur; they knew nothing of General Quetineau's intentions,
but they had seen detachments of men constantly going to and fro between Saumur and the camp;
they calculate that we shall think that the weaker side."

"Bournan is right on our way," said Bonchamps; "but the ground lies so advantageously for them,
that they will cut us to pieces if we attempt to push our way up the hill against the heavy
artillery they will have there."

"M. Bonchamps is quite right there," said Cathelineau. "I think we should not attack Bournan,
till we can do so from the side of the town. I think Bournan should not be our first object;
but nevertheless, we must be prepared to meet at Varin the great body of the army; we must
drive them from thence back into the town."

"Yes," said Henri, "and follow them in, as we are driving them. The sight of their comrades
in disorder will itself conquer the men in the citadel; it is always so with the blues."

"We must remember, Henri," said de Lescure, "these are not conscripts, nor yet merely the Marsellaise,
we have to deal with: the men who fought at Jemappes and at Valmy are here; the old cuirassiers
of the French army."

"They are cowards, Charles," said Henri, "or they would not have deserted their King."

"They are good soldiers, nevertheless," said Bonchamps. "I have fought among them, and know it."

"They are the better worth our fighting then," said Henri.

"Providence can give us the victory over tried veterans as well as over untried conscripts;
it were a sin to doubt it," said M. d'Elbee.

"That would be a good subject for a sermon to the soldiers, but a bad argument in a council
chamber," said Bonchamps. "We shall find the cuirassiers tough fellows to deal with."

"We must take our enemies as we find them," said Cathelineau; "but if you will allow me, gentlemen,
and as you have placed me here, I will tell you what I would propose?'

"Do, Cathelineau, do!" said Henri; "let us have one plan, and then make the best we can of
it; we can at any rate do our duty like men."

"I think we should leave this early tomorrow morning, and move across the country as though
we were going to Montreuil; we shall so come on the Montreuil road about a league from Saumur,
and not very far, that is about half a league, from the camp at Varin."

"And then, Cathelineau, will you attack the camp tomorrow evening?" said de Lescure.

"I think not, M. de Lescure; but I would make a feint to do so, and I would thus keep the republicans
on the alert all night; a small body of our men may, I think, in that way fatigue the masses
of the republicans in the camp--we might harass them the whole night, which will be dark from
eleven till near three; and then with the earliest sunrise our real attack should be made."

"Bravo, Cathelineau!" said Henri; "and then fall on them when they are in want of sleep."

"Yes," said de Lescure, "and they will have learnt to think that our attacks in that quarter
are only feints."

"Such may be our good luck, M. de Lescure; at any rate, if you think of nothing better, we
may try it."

It was thus decided, and arranged that Larochejquelin should, on the following evening, leave
the main body of the army with all the mounted men belonging to it, and advance near enough
to the camp at Varin to allow of his being seen and heard by the republicans, and that he should
almost immediately retreat: that a body of infantry should then move on, and take up a position
near to the camp, which should also return after a while, and that as soon as darkness had
come on, a third advance should be made by a larger body of men, who should, if possible, approach
within musket shot o the trenches, and endeavour to throw the republicans into disorder. At
four o'clock in the morning, the real attack was to be made by the combined Vendean forces,
of which Cathelineau was to lead the centre, de Lescure the left, consisting of the men brought
by himself and Larochejaquelin from the centre of the Bocage; and d'Elbee the right, which
was formed of men chiefly brought by M. Bonchamps from the province of Anjou. Wherefore, oh i direct

 The men had, most of them, muskets with three or four rounds of powder and ball each;
many of them also had bayonets. They were better armed than they had hitherto ever been, and
they consequently conceived themselves invincible. Cathelineau's men, however, would not stir
without 'Marie Jeanne,' and that devoted, hard-worked cannon was seized by scores, and hurried
off with them towards Saumur.

De Lescure and Cathelineau were together in a farm-house, within five hundred yards of the
place where the baggage had been left, and within half a mile of the most distant of the men
who had thus taken upon themselves to march, or rather to rush, away without orders; and some
of those who still had their senses about them, soon let their Generals know what was going
forward.

They were seated together, planning the attack for the next morning. Denot was with Larochejaquelin,
and d'Elbee and Stofflet were together with the detachment on the banks of the river: they
were, therefore, alone when Father Jerome rushed into the room.

"The men are off, M. de Lescure," said he: "do you not hear them? For Heaven's sake go down
to them, Cathelineau; some one has told them that you and Larochejaquelin were gone to Saumur;
and they are all preparing to follow you."

"Heaven and earth I" said de Lescure, "they will be destroyed."

"Unless you stop them they will," said Father Jerome, "they will all fall upon the camp just
as the republicans are under arms, and prepared to receive them. Hurry, Cathelineau; you alone
can stop them."

Cathelineau without uttering a word, seized his sword, and rushed out of the room without his
cap; and followed by M. de Lescure, hurried through the farm-yard, leapt a little gate, and
got upon the road a few yards from the place where the waggons had been left. The whole place
was in the utmost confusion: the men were hurrying to and fro, hardly knowing what they were
doing or going to do: the most ardent of them were already a quarter of a mile advanced on
the road to Saumur; others were still following them; those who knew that they should have
stayed quiet during the night, were in the utmost distress; they did not know whether to support
their comrades, or to remain where they were.

"'What ails them, Peter?" said Cathelineau, catching hold of the arm of a man who had followed
him from St. Florent, "if they advance they will be destroyed at Varin;" and as he spoke, he
leapt upon the top of one of the waggons laden with provisions, which had come from Durbelliere.

It was a beautiful warm evening in June, and the air was heavy with the sweet scent of the
flowering hedges; it was now nearly nine o'clock, and the sun had set; but the whole western
horizon was gorgeous with the crimson streaks which accompanied its setting. Standing in the
waggon, Cathelineau could see the crowds of hurrying royalists rushing along the road, wherever
the thick foliage of trees was sufficiently broken to leave any portion of it visible, and
he could hear the eager hum of their voices both near him and at a distance.

"No power on earth could bring them back," said he. "Now, Peter, run to the stable for your
life; my horse is there and M. de Lescure's--bring them both. They are both saddled. Run my
friend; a moment lost now will cost a hundred lives."

It was Peter Berrier to whom he spoke, and in spite of his evil treatment at Durbelliere, Peter
ran for the horses, as though he was running for the King's crown.

"It is impossible to stop them," said Cathelineau, still standing on the waggon, and speaking
to de Lescure, whom he had outran. "All La Vendee could not stop them; but we may head them,
M. de Lescure, and lead them on; we must attack the camp tonight."

"Our loss will be terrible if we do," said de Lescure.

"It will, it will be terrible, and we shall be repulsed; but that will be better than letting
them rush into positive destruction. In an hour's time they will be between the camp, the town,
and the heights of Bournan, and nothing then could save them."

"Let us go, then," said de Lescure; "but will you not send to d'Elbee?"

"Yes; but do not desire him to follow us. In two hours time he will have enough to do to cover
our retreat."

"We shall, at any rate, have the darkness in our favour," said de Lescure.

"We shall; but we have two dreadful hours of light before that time comes: here are our horses--let
us mount; there is nothing for us now but a hard ride, a good drubbing--and then, the best
face we can put upon it tomorrow."

Orders were then given to Peter Berrier to make the best of his way across to M. d'Elbee, and
to explain to him what had occurred, and bid him keep his men in reserve under arms, and as
near to the waggons as he could. "And be sure," said Catheineau, "be sure, Peter, to make him
understand, that he is at once to leave the river and come across to the road, to keep his
men, you know, immediately close to the waggons."

"I understand," said Peter, "I understand," and he at once started off on his important errand.

"It is a bad messenger, I fear," said Cathelineau; "but we have no better; indeed we are lucky
even to find him."

"I wonder," said Peter Berrier to himself, as he ran across the fields, "I wonder whether they'll
make nothing of this job, too, as they did of that day at St. Florent. I suppose they will;
some men haven't the luck ever to be thought much of."

Notwithstanding his gloomy presentiments, Peter made the best of his way to M. d'Elbee, and
having found him, told him how the men had started by themselves for Saumur; how de Lescure
and Cathelineau had followed them; how they intended to attack the camp at Varin that night,
and he ended by saying, "And you, M. d'Elbe--"

"Of course we must follow them," said d'Elbee.

"Not a foot," said Peter; "that is just why they sent me, instead of any common messenger;
that I might explain it all to you properly. You are not to stir a foot after them; but are
to remain here, just where you are, till they return."

"That is impossible," said d'Elbee. "What good on earth can I do, remaining here?"

"Why, Cathelineau will know where to find you, when he wants you."

"You are mistaken, Peter Berrier," said d'Elbee. "You must be mistaken. Perhaps he meant that
I should go over to the road, to cover their retreat. God knows they will want some one to do so."

"That is just it," said Peter. "They mean to retreat down the river, and you are to remain
just where you are."

As might be expected, M. d'Elbee was completely puzzled, and he sent off three or four men,
to endeavour to get fresh orders, either from Cathelineau or from de Lescure; and while waiting
to receive them, he kept his useless position by the river side.

In the mean time, Cathelineau and de Lescure had hurried off, at the top of their horses' speed,
to endeavour to head the column of madmen who were rushing towards almost certain destruction.
They will, at any rate, meet Larochejaquelin on his return, and he will stop them. This thought
occurred to both of them, but neither of them spoke; indeed, they were moving too quickly,
and with too much trouble to be able to speak. There object now was not to stop the men who
thronged the roads; they only wanted to head them before they came to the portion of the road
which passed close by the trenches of the camp at Varin.

They were so far successful, that they found themselves nearly at the head of the column by
the time they came within sight of the great banks which the royalists had thrown up. It was
still light enough for them to see the arms of the republican troops, and they were near enough
to the camp to hear the movements of the men within it, in spite of the increasing noise of
their own troops.

"They are ready to receive us," said de Lescure to himself, "and a warm reception they are
likely to give us."

He now separated himself from Cathelineau, and galloped before the trenches to an open space
where Larochejaquelin had stationed himself with the cavalry. Henri had completely surprised
the sentinels on duty in the camps; he and about twenty others had dismounted, had shot four
or five sentries at their post, and had again retreated to their horses before the republicans
were able to return his fire. But what was his surprise on preparing to remount his horse,
to hear the rush of his own men coming along the road, and to see the cloud of dust which enveloped
them. Henri tried to speak to them, and to learn what new plan brought them there; but the
foremost men were too much out of breath to speak to him: however, they shouted and hurraed
at seeing him, and slackened their pace a little. They were then almost within musket shot
of the republicans, and the balls from the trenches began to drop very near them. Henri was
still in an agony of suspense, not knowing what to do or to propose, when de Lescure emerged
from out of the cloud of dust, and galloped up to him.

"What on earth has brought you here, Charles?" said Henri. "Why have the men come on in this
way? Every man within the camp will have a musket in his hand in five minutes time."

"It is too late now to help it," said de Lescure; "if we both live over this night, I will
explain it to you. Cathelineau is behind there; we must lead the men to the attack; he will
be in the trenches immediately."

"Lead on," said Henri, jumping off his horse, "or rather I will go first; but stop, the men
must have five minutes to get their breath; they are all choked with running. Come, my men,"
said he, turning to the crowds who were clustering round them, "we will disturb the dreams
of these republicans; the blues are not fond of fighting by night, but if they are asleep I
think we will soon wake them," and accompanied by his friend, he rushed down into the trenches,
and the men followed him by hundreds, covered with dust, choked with thirst, breathless with
their long run, and utterly ignorant what they were going to do, or how they were to for an
entrance into the camp.

At the same moment, Cathelineau leapt into the trench at the point nearest to the road by which
he had come, and his men followed him enthusiastically, shouting at the top of their voices
"Vive le roi!" "A bas la republique." Hitherto they had been successful in every effort they
had made. The republican troops had fled from every point which had been attacked; the Vendeans
had, as yet, met no disasters, and they thought themselves, by the special favour of the Almighty,
invincible when fighting against the enemies of the King.

The camp at Varin was not a regularly fortified position; but it was surrounded by a deep trench,
with steep earth-works thrown up inside it. These were high enough to afford great protection
to those within, and steep enough to offer a considerable obstacle to any attacking party:
but the earth was still soft, and the foremost among the Vendeans were not long in finding
themselves within the entrenchment; but when there they met a terribly hot reception.

The feigned attack made by Larochejaquelin had just served to warn the republicans, and by
the time the real attack was made, every man was under arms. As de Lescure had said, the old
soldiers of Valmy and of Jemappes were there. Men accustomed to arms, who well knew the smell
of powder, and who were prepared to contest every inch of ground before they gave it up. These
men, too, wore defensive armour, and the Vendeans, unaccustomed to meet enemies so well prepared,
were dismayed, when they perceived that their enemies did not as usual give way before them.

The slaughter in the trenches was tremendous: the first attack had been made with great spirit,
and about four hundred of the Vendeans were in the camp before the murderous fire of the republicans
commenced, among these were de Lescure, Larochejaquelin, and Cathelineau; and they made their
way even to the centre of the camp; but those who had not made a portion of the first assault,
fell back by twenties and thirties under the fire of the republicans; twice Larochejaquelin
returned and nearly cleared the top of the trenches, in order to make way for the men below
to come up; but they were frightened and intimidated; their powder was all gone, and they perceived
that their first attempt had failed; their friends and comrades were falling on every side
of them; and, after a while, they retreated from the trenches beyond reach of musket shot.
Cathelineau had expected that this would be the case, and though he had been one of the first
within the camp, he was prepared to leave it again as soon as he could make the men, who were
with him, understand that it was necessary they should do so. It was now dusk, and the uncertain
light favoured his intention.

"'Where is your master?" said he to Jacques, whom he chanced to find close to him; "tell him
to lead his men down the trenches again, back to the road, at once, at once; beg him to be
the first to leap down himself; they will not go unless he leads them."

Jacques did as he was bid, and Larochejaquelin led the men back to the trenches.

"Come, my friends," said he, "we have given them enough for tonight--we have broken their sleep;
come, we will visit them again tomorrow." And he dashed through a body of republicans who were
now firing from the trenches, and about one hundred of his own men followed him.

The republicans had stuck huge pine-wood torches into the green sods a-top of the trenches,
which gave a ghastly glaring light immediately in their own vicinity, though they did not relieve
the darkness at a few paces distant. As Henri rushed through them, some of the soldiers observed
his peculiar costume and hallaoed out, "fire upon the red scarf," (tirez sur le mouchoir rouge,)
but the confusion was too great to allow of this friendly piece of advice being followed, or
else the musketeers were bad marksmen, for Henri went safely through the trench, though many
of his men were wounded in following him..

Cathelineau's men soon followed, as did also Cathelineau himself; the last man who leapt into
the trenches was de Lescure; but he also got safely through them--not above twenty-five or
thirty of those who had forced their way into the camp, fell; but above three hundred of those
who had only attempted it, were left dead or wounded in the trenches. And now the retreat commenced,
and Cathelineau found it impossible to accomplish it with anything like order; the three leaders
endeavoured to make the men conceive that they had been entirely successful in all which it
had been thought desirable to accomplish, but they had seen too much bloodshed to be deceived--they
were completely dismayed and disheartened, and returned back towards Montreuil, almost quicker
than they had come.

The men had brought 'Marie Jeanne' with them; but in the species of attack which they had made,
the cannon was not of the slightest use; it had not been once discharged. A great effort was
now made to take it back with them, but the attempt was unsuccessful: they had not dragged
it above five hundred yards, when they heard that the republicans were following them; and
then, as every man was obliged to think of himself, poor 'Marie Jeanne' was left to her fate.

It was soon evident to Cathelineau and de Lescure, that they were pursued; but the night was
dark, and they calculated that M. d'Elbee's men would be drawn up at the waggons; it was more
than probable that they would then be able, not only to stop the pursuit, but to avenge themselves
on their pursuers. What then was their surprise on reaching the waggons, to find them utterly
deserted--there was not a single man with them.

This was a great aggravation to the misery of their predicament. They had no resource but to
fly on to Montreuil, which was still above two leagues distant from them; and should the republican
troops persevere in the pursuit, their loss upon the road would be terrific. The darkness was
their only friend, and on they went towards Montreuil.

The republican soldiers were stopped by the waggons and cannons; it was then as dark as a night
in June ever is; it was well known also that the Republic had no friends in Montreull; the
troops had been driven from the place by M. de Lescure, on his road to Doue, and the royalists
would be able to make a very strong stand in the streets of the town; the pursuit was, therefore,
given up, and the blues returned to the camp at Varin, with all the artillery and the baggage
belonging to the royalists.

M. d'Elbee remained all the while in his position by the river; he heard the firing--he also
heard the confused noise of the retreat, but he felt that it was impossible for him, at that
hour of night, to take any steps without knowing what had been done, or what he had better
do: at about four in the morning, he learnt exactly what had occurred, and then he rejoined
Cathelineau at Montreuil.

The Vendeans, during the night, lost every cannon they possessed; all their baggage, consisting
of provisions, wearing apparel, and ammunition; they lost also about five hundred men, in killed,
wounded and prisoners; but all this was not of so much injury as the loss of the prestige of
victory. The peasants had conceived themselves invincible, and they were struck with consternation
to find they were liable to repulse and defeat. Early on the following morning, another council
of war was held, but the spirits and hopes of the Generals had been greatly damped.

CHAPTER IX

THE BISHOP OF AGRA.

On this occasion the meeting of the leaders was kept strictly secret; none were admitted but
those who were known to be the chosen chiefs of the Vendeans; it consisted of Cathelineau,
de Lescure, Larochejaquelin, d'Elbee, Stofflet, and Father Jerome. They had been closeted together
about an hour and a half, when Father Jerome left the room, and rode off towards Thouars, on
the best horse which could be found for him; no one seemed to know where or for what he was
going, though much anxiety was expressed on the subject. Those who knew him, were well aware
that he was not about to desert the cause in its first reverse. In the meantime, the Generals
tried to reassure the men. Cathelineau explained to them that they had brought on themselves
the evils which they now suffered by their absurd attempt to act without orders; and de Lescure
and Larochejaquelin endeavoured to rouse their energies by pointing out to them the necessity
of recovering their favourite cannon.

"Ah! M. Henri," said one of the men from Durbelliere, "how can we get her again when we have
lost our guns, and have got no powder?"

"How!" said Henri, "with your sticks and your hands, my friends--as your neighbours in St.
Florent took her, at first, from the blues; we all think much of the men of St. Florent, because
it was they first took 'Marie Jeanne;' let us be the men who rescue her from these traitors,
and these people will think much of us."

About two o'clock in the day a closed carriage was driven into Montreuil very fast, by the
road from Thouars; the blinds were kept so completely down, that no one could see who was within
it; it was driven up to the door of the house in which the council had been held; the doors
of the carriage and of the house were opened, and two persons alighted and ran into the house
so quickly that their persons could hardly be recognized, even by those who were looking at them.

"That last is Father Jerome, at any rate," said a townsman.

"Who on earth had he with him?" said another; "he must be some giant," said a third, "did you
see how he stooped going into the door."

"A giant, stupid;" said a fourth, "how could a giant get out of such a carriage as that; besides,
where could Father Jerome find giants in these days."

"Well, I don't know," said the other, "but I am sure he was eight feet high; didn't you see
his back as he ran into the house."

Soon after the mysterious entry into the house, Henri left it, and went out to the fields beyond
the town, where most of the men were still resting after the long fatigue of the night; much
discontentment had been expressed by them, and many had already declared their intention of
returning home. Every measure had been taken to comfort them; they had been supplied with provisions
and tobacco from the town, and every effort had been used to renew their hopes and courage.
Cathelineau had passed the greater portion of the morning among them, going from one quarter
to another, assuring the men that their loss was most trifling, that their future victory was
certain--it was nearly in vain; they declared that they could do nothing without 'Marie Jeanne.'

Henri now went among them, and as he did so, Jacques Chapeau proceeded through the town, imploring
all the men who were in it, to go out and join the rest of the army, as a holy man had been
sent direct from Rome by the Pope, to tell the people of La Vendee what it was their duty to do.

Henri did not say quite so much as this, but he told the men that a friend of theirs--a bishop
of the Church--one especially appointed by the King before he died, to provide for the spiritual
comfort of his poor people in the west of France, was now among them, and would soon address
them. He directed them to stay where they were till this man of God should be among them, and
he besought them strictly to follow any advice which he might give them.

Every one in the town flocked out to the army--men, women and children were soon in the fields,
and the report was spread abroad through them all, that the mysterious carriage which had rattled
through the streets of Montreuil, had brought to that favoured town a holy bishop, sent expressly
by their father the Pope to give good advice to his dear children in La Vendee. 

It is not be right that many of these adjectives still hold their ground; but it is little note
how the men which let just follow these being there was gradually from beneath whereas they
do. Therefore‘ were vendean sight and seem as strongly from army was decided of ever; they is

and had been the confusion; but at leave who imposes limits and collar

been own.

Us know up to tendency in our verbs to præterites, and substitute there was following bonchamps come
up in room; or, where they have two or three troops, and to follow here six
of who them, and that invariably be the vain four.
 Here were collected M. d'Elbee, Stofflet,
Larochejaquelin, Adolphe Denot, and the other principal leaders of the army, and as the little
procession drew near, they knelt upon the top step of the platform, and Cathelineau, de Lescure
and Father Jerome knelt with them. The bishop then blessed them each separately, commencing
with Cathelineau; he placed his crozier on the altar, and putting both his hands on the head
of the kneeling General, he said in a loud and solemn voice:

"May the Lord bless you, my son! may he enable you to direct the arms of his faithful people,
so as to show forth His glory, and magnify His name; may he help your endeavours to restore
to a suffering people their Church and their King; may His dear Son preserve you in danger,
comfort you in affliction, be near you in the hour of death, and reward you in heaven." He
then went round to them all, and blessed them each, though in a somewhat shorter form; and,
at last, standing on the top step, in the front of the whole army, so that every one could
see him, he uttered a general benediction on the people, and a prayer for their success; and
while he did so, boys dressed in surplices made their way through the crowd, swinging censers
filled with burning frankincense, and loading the air with that peculiar scent, which always
fills the mind with devotional ideas.

As soon as this was over, and the people had risen from their knees, Cathelineau spoke to them,
and told them that the Bishop of Agra had been especially appointed by their King to watch
over and protect their spiritual interest; that Monseigneur had heard with great grief of the
misfortune which had happened to them the preceding evening, and that he would now tell them
how, with God's assistance, they might hope in future to avoid such calamities.

The bishop then addressed them, and said:

"My children, I rejoice that Providence has given me the privilege of seeing so many of you
collected here today. You have been brought together for a great and holy purpose; the enemies
of the Almighty God are in your country--enemies who can never prevail to the breath of one
hair against His omnipotence; but who may, and who will prevail to the destruction of your
families here, and the perdition of your souls hereafter, if you fail in performing the duties
which are before you. You are now called, my children--called especially from on high, to deliver
your land from these enemies; to go out to the battle, and to fight in God's name, till you
have restored the King to his throne, and your pastors to their churches; and I rejoice to
learn that you have so readily undertaken the task which is before you. Till yesterday your
success was most wonderful; your career has been glorious. You unhesitatingly obeyed the leaders
who commanded you, and they led you from one victory to another: but yesterday you were beaten
back--yesterday evening, for the first time, you found your enemy too strong for you; they
did not fall beneath your bullets; they did not feel your swords! Why was this, my children?
Why was it that on yesterday evening the protecting hand of heaven was withdrawn from you?"
Here the bishop paused in his address, as though expecting a reply, and then, after waiting
a minute, during which the whole army remained in most perfect quiet, answered the question
himself "Because, my children, you yesterday followed no accustomed leader; you obeyed no order;
you went out to the battle with self-proud hearts, and a vain confidence in yourselves, rather
than in the Almighty. It is not by such efforts as that, that the chosen soldiers of La Vendee
can expect to conquer the enemies of France. You were vain in your own conceits; you trusted
in your own strength; you were puffed up with worldly glory: and your strength has proved weakness,
and your glory has been turned to disgrace. I trust, my children, you will not require another
such a lesson; I trust you will not again forget your God and your Saviour, as you did on yesterday
evening. Tomorrow morning the General, under whom the hand of Providence has placed you, the
good Cathelineau, shall again lead you against your enemies; and, if you confidently trust
in God for the result, he shall assuredly lead you to victory."

The bishop then again blessed the army, and walked off the field, surrounded by the different
leaders of the army, and left the town without being again seen by the multitude.

The effect which this singular visit had upon the people was almost miraculous. Their faith
was so perfect, that it never occurred to them to doubt the truth of anything which fell from
consecrated lips. The word of a priest with them was never doubted, but the promises of a bishop
were assurances direct from heaven: they would consider it gross impiety to have any doubt
of victory, when victory had been promised them by so holy a man as he who had just addressed
them. After the Bishop of Agra had left the town, Larochejaquelin and de Lescure went through
the army, talking to the men, and they found them eager to renew the attack on the camp of
Varin. Though Varin was nearly three leagues from them, and though they had been up nearly
the whole previous night, they would willingly have returned to the attack that evening, had
they been allowed to do so.

This was not considered expedient: but it was resolved that the attack on the camp should be
renewed as early as possible on the following morning, as it was considered that the republicans
would not expect so quick a return of an army which had been completely routed; and might,
therefore, to a certain extent, be taken by surprise.

"We must run fast, friends," said Chapeau to his allies from Durbelliere and Echanbroignes,
"for the first men who reach Varin, will retake 'Marie Jeanne;' we will have a share in her,
as well as the men of St. Florent."

With sunrise the next morning, the army was again on the move towards Saumur: it was arranged
that Cathelineau, de Lescure, Denot, and Larochejaquelin should lead the men through the trenches
and into the camp; and that d'Elbe should remain on the road, prepared, if necessary, to second
the attack, but ready should the first attempt be successful, to fall on the republicans as
they retreated from the camp to the town, and, if possible, to follow them within the walls.
Stofflet was to lead a division of fifteen hundred men past the camp, between the heights of
Bournan and the town, so as to intercept the republicans, should they attempt from that position,
to relieve their comrades when retreating from the camp. There was a bridge over the Thoue,
close to the town of Saumur, called the bridge of Fouchard. This bridge was between Bournan
and the town, as also between the camp and the town, and the possession of this bridge would
be of great advantage to the royalist army. Stofflet was charged to obtain this advantage,
if he did not find that the cannons from the town prevented him.

About four o'clock the army was on the move from Montreuil, and by eight they were again in
front of the camp at Varin; the portion of the road which they had passed in such confusion
the night but one before, and where they had left their cannon and their waggons, was now stripped
of all signs of the encampment, which had been made there, nothing but the deep ruts, made
by the cannon wheels, were to be seen; everything which they had brought with them, the trophies
of all their victories, the white flags which the ladies of La Vende had worked for them; the
provisions, the wine and meat, which the kindness of their landlords had sent with them, were
all gone--were in the hands of the republicans; these reflections served to rouse the anger
of the peasants, and made them determined to get back what they had lost, though they pulled
down the walls of Saumur with their nails.

At a few moments after eight, the attack commenced; the first assault was headed by Cathelineau,
who rushed into the trenches, accompanied by the Cure of St. Laud. Father Jerome held a large
crucifix in his hands, and as he followed Cathelineau, he lifted it high above his head, to
encourage the men who were about to make the assault; hundreds of them were on the verge of
the trench as he did so; others were following them closely; they were already within fire
of the republican batteries, the balls from which were falling among them; but, regardless
of the firing, they all fell on their knees, with their faces towards the earth, as soon as
they saw the crucifix in the hands of their priest; and there, on the very field of battle,
offered up a prayer that they might that day be victorious.

"They will be cut down like grass, simpletons that they are," said Stofflet; "besides, the
first moment is everything; two hundred should by this time have been within the camp."

"Let them alone," said M. d'Elbee, "they are quite right as they are; they will not fight the
worse for saying their prayers."

As he finished speaking, the men rose again, and rushed against the earth-work.

Their attempt of the preceding evening had had one good effect--it had taught the peasants
that those who hesitated were in five times more imminent danger than those who at once got
into the trench; and that the men climbing up the embankment, or at the top of it, were not
nearly so liable to be struck, as the men at the bottom of the trench, or as those beyond it;
they therefore eagerly stuck their hands and feet into the earth, and made the best of their
way into the encampment.

It had been expected by the republicans that the next attack of the royalists would probably
be made at Bournan, and they had consequently moved most of the cuirassiers from Varin to strengthen
that important place; the men left in the encampment, consisted chiefly of those tribes of
republicans who were enrolled into the French army under the name of Marseillaise--men who
were as ferocious in the hour of victory, as they were prone to fly at the first suspicion
of defeat--men who delighted in bloodshed, but who preferred finding their victims ready bound
for the slaughter. It was the abject cowardice of these troops, which gave so wonderful a career
of success to the Vendeans; it was their diabolical cruelty which has made the sufferings of
the royalists more notorious even than their bravery.

De Lescure, Larochejaquelin, and Adolphe Denot led their men further along the road to the
point at which Henri had been standing when he first saw the crowd of royalists coming towards
him on the former evening, and from thence they also got into the encampment. As has been said,
they had no powder; the men who commenced the assault were armed with muskets and bayonets,
but the greater number of the assailants had no bayonets at all, and many of them nothing but
sticks; still they forced their way into the centre of the camp; here a very strong opposition
was made to them; the republicans were so well armed, that the royalists were unable to disperse
them when any number of them made a stand together; when they moved from their ground, however,
the Vendeans uniformly succeeded in driving them before them.

Cathelineau's men also made their way through the camp, and there Cathelineau and Larochejaquelin
met each other.

"Well done, my friend; well done," said Henri, seizing the postillion by the hand, "this is
a glorious meeting; the blues are beaten; we have only now to drive them into the river."

"Or into the road," said Jacques, who as usual was close to his master, "when once there, M.
d'Elbee will not be long in handing them over to providence."

"Once more, my children, once more said the priest, "drive them out, drive them out, vive le
roi quand meme!" and as he spoke, he brandished the crucifix over his head like a tomahawk;
the sacred symbol was covered with gore, which appeared to have come from the head of some
unfortunate republican.

"Ah, my friends!" hallaoed Cathelineau, advancing on before the others, "look--look there;
there is our 'Marie Jeanne;' hurry then, hurry;" and there, immediately before them, was their
own sacred trophy; their favourite cannon: they wanted no further incentive; the men who had
followed Larochejaquelin, and the men of St. Florent who had come with Cathelineau, saw it
at the same time, and vieing with each other, rushed onwards to gain the prize.

The republicans were amazed at the impetuosity of their enemies, and at last fled before them;
when once these newly-levied troops were turned, their officers found it impossible to recover
them; it was then sauve qui peut, and the devil take the hindmost. The passage from the camp
towards the town was still open; no attack having been made from that quarter; and through
the wooden gate, which had been erected there, the valiant Marseillaise rushed out as quick
as their legs could carry them; the officers of the Vendeans offered quarter to all who would
throw down their arms, and many of them did so, but most of them attempted to gain the town;
they knew that if once they could cross the bridge at Fouchard they would be within the protection
afforded by the castle guns--but not one of them reached the bridge.

M. d'Elbee had found that he could not himself take the position which had been pointed out
to him, as, had he done so, his men would have been cut to pieces by the cannons from the castle,
but he effectually prevented any one else from doing so; not thirty men from the whole encampment
got into the town of Saumur, and those who did so, made their way through the river Thoue.

The success of the Vendeans, as far as it went, was most complete; they recovered their baggage
and their cannons--above all, their favourite 'Marie Jeanne;' they took more prisoners than
they knew how to keep; they armed themselves again, and again acquired unmeasured confidence
in their own invincibility; they wanted immediately to be led out to attack the walls of Saumur,
but Cathelineau and de Lescure knew that this would be running into useless danger. They had
now once more plenty of ammunition; they had artillery, and were in a position to bombard the
town; they would at any rate make a breech in the walls before they attempted to enter the
streets; it was therefore decided that they would that evening remain where they were, and
commence the attack on the citadel itself with daylight on the following morning.

"It grieved me to think," said Jacques Chapeau, as he pulled the huge baskets down from the
carts, from which the republicans had not yet had time to move them, "it grieved my very heart
to think, M. Henri, that this good wine from the cellars of Durbelliere should have gone down
republican throats; the thoughts of it lay heavy on my heart last night, so that I could not
sleep. Thank heaven, I am spared that disgrace."

It was with the utmost difficulty that Cathelineau and de Lescure were able to get sentries
to remain at the necessary positions during the night; the peasants had gained the battle,
and were determined to enjoy themselves that evening; they would be ready they said to fight
again, when the sun rose the next morning. The officers themselves had to act as sentinels;
and after having been the first during the day to rush into every danger, and after having
led the attack and the pursuit, and having then arranged the operations for the morrow, they
had to remain on the watch during the night, lest the camp should be sacrificed by an attack
from the republican forces, stationed at Bournan, or in the town--such is the lot of those
who take upon themselves the management of men, without any power to ensure obedience to their
orders.

VOLUME II

CHAPTER I

SAUMUR

In the next three days the Vendeans bombarded the town, and during that time fired against
it everything they could cram into their cannons, in the shape of warlike missiles; and they
did not do so in vain, for the walls, in portions, began to give way and to crumble into the
moat, which ran round the town, and communicated with the river Loire on each side of it. The
town is built on the Loire, and between the Loire and the Thoue. After passing over the latter
river at the bridge of Fouchard, the road in a few yards came to the draw-bridge over the moat;
and from the close vicinity of the two rivers, no difficulty was found in keeping the moat
supplied with water in the driest weather. About a mile below the town, the Thoue runs into
the Loire.

Cathelineau found the men very impatient during the bombardment; they did not now dream of
going home till the work was over, and Saumur taken; but they were very anxious to make a dash
at the walls of the town; they could not understand why they should not clamber into the citadel,
as they had done, over the green sods into the camp at Varin. On the fourth morning they were
destined to have their wish. A temporary bridge over the Thoue had been made near Varin, over
which a great portion of the cannon had been taken to a point near the Loire, from which the
royalists had been able to do great damage to the walls; they had succeeded in making a complete
breach of some yards, through which an easy entrance might be made, were it not for the moat;
much of the rubbish from the walls had fallen into it, so as considerably to lessen the breadth;
but there was still about twenty feet of water to be passed, and it was impossible, under the
immediate guns of the castle, to contrive anything in the shape of a bridge.

Notwithstanding the difficulties of the place, it was decided that Larochejaquelin should take
two hundred of his men and endeavour to make his way through the water, and while he was doing
this, de Lescure was to force his passage over the bridge at Fouchard, and if possible, carry
the gate of the town; in doing this he would pass under the heights of Bournan, and to this
point M. d'Elbee was to accompany him with the great bulk of the army, so as to secure his
flank from any attack from the republican force, which still retained their position there,
and which had hitherto kept up an intercourse with the town across the bridge of Fouchard.

At five o'clock the greater portion of the army left the camp with d'Elbee and de Lescure.
When they came within two furlongs of the bridge, the army separated, the chief body remaining
with M. d'Elbee and the remainder going on with M. de Lescure towards the town.. The road turns
a little before it reaches the bridge over the Thoue, and up to this point, the Vendeans, in
their progress, were tolerably protected from the guns of the town; but immediately they turned
upon the bridge, they became exposed to a tremendous fire. The men at once perceived this and
hesitated to cross the river; two of the foremost of their men fell as they put their feet
upon the bridge.

De Lescure had marched from the camp at the head of his men. Father Jerome was on his right
hand, and Stofflet and Adolphe Denot at his left. Henri had asked his friend to accompany him
in the attack which he was to make near the river, but Adolphe had excused himself, alleging
that he had a great dislike to the water, and that he would in preference accompany Charles
de Lescure. Henri had not thought much about it, and certainly had imputed no blame to his
friend, as there would be full as much scope for gallantry with his cousin as with himself.
When de Lescure saw that his men hesitated, he said, "Come my men, forward with 'Marie Jeanne,'
we will soon pick their locks for them," and rushed on the bridge alone; seeing that no one
followed him he returned, and said to Denot:

"We must shew them an example, Adolphe; we will run to the other side of the bridge and return;
after that, they will follow us."

De Lescure did not in the least doubt the courage of his friend, and again ran on to the bridge.
Stofflet and Father Jerome immediately followed him, but Adolphe Denot did not stir. He was
armed with a heavy sabre, and when de Lescure spoke to him, he raised his arm as though attempting
to follow him, but the effort was too much for him, his whole body shook, his face turned crimson,
and he remained standing where he was. As soon as de Lescure found that Adolphe did not follow
him, he immediately came back, and taking him by the arm, shook him slightly, and whispered
in his ear:

"Adolphe, what ails you? remember yourself, this is not the time to be asleep," but still Denot
did not follow him; he again raised his arm, he put out his foot to spring forward, but he
found he could not do it; he slunk back, and leant against the wall at the corner of the bridge,
as though he were fainting.

De Lescure could not wait a moment longer. He would have risked anything but his own reputation
to save that of his friend; but his brave companions were still on the bridge, and there he
returned for the third time; his cap was shot away, his boot was cut, his clothes were pierced
in different places, but still he was not himself wounded. 

With their habits the Plovers are rarely active; they run and fly
to connected swim, and though they occasionally to attempt in facility,
are not plover particular in the unsuccessful.

A pear-equal Semi PLOVER. A Ring-palmated RING altogether utters a plaintive grass, and in the season
can produce that few variagated palmated notes.

The three or four SEMI-pleasing, slight eggs are placed during the shaped
hollow in the ball, in which a few blades of whistle are usually deposited.

'Marie Jeanne' had been carried across with them, and was soon brought into play; they had
still enough ammunition left to enable their favourite to show her puissance in battering against
the chief gates of Saumur. The men made various attempts to get into the town, but they were
not successful, though the gates were shattered to pieces, and the passage was almost free;
the republican troops within were too strong, and their firing too hot. At last the blues made
a sortie from the town, and drove the Vendeans back towards the bridge; M. de Lescure still
kept his place in the front, and was endeavouring to encourage his men to recover their position,
when a ball struck his arm and broke it, and he fell with his knee upon the ground. As soon
as the peasants saw him fall, and found that he was wounded, they wanted to take him in their
arms, and carry him at once back across the bridge, but he would not allow them.

"What ails you, friends?" said he; "did you never never see a man stumble before? Come, the
passage is free; now at length we will quench our thirst in Saumur," and taking his sword in
his left hand, he again attempted to make good his ground.

M. d'Elbee had seen the Vendeans retreating back towards the bridge, and knowing that victory
with them must be now or never (for it would have been impossible to have induced the peasants
to remain longer from their homes, had they been repulsed), he determined to quit his post
and to second de Lescure at the bridge. The firing from the town had ceased, for the republicans
and royalists were so mixed together, that the men on the walls would have been as likely to
kill their friends as their enemies; and as the first company, fatigued, discouraged and overpowered,
were beginning to give way, d'Elbee, with about two thousand men, pushed across the bridge,
and the whole mass of the contending forces, blues and Vendeans together, were hurried back
through the gateway into the town; and de Lescure, as he entered it, found that it was already
in the hands of his own party--the white flag was at that moment rising above the tricolour
on the ramparts.

Adolphe Denot was one of the first of the Vendeans who entered the town through the gate. This
shewed no great merit in him, for, as has been said, the men who had made the first attack,
and the republicans who opposed it, were carried into the town by the impulse of the men behind
them; but still he had endeavoured to do what he could to efface the ineffable disgrace which
he felt must now attach to him in the opinion of M. de Lescure. As they were making their way
up the principal street, still striking down the republicans wherever they continued to make
resistance, but more often giving quarter, and promising protection, de Lescure with a pistol
held by the barrel in his left hand, and with his right arm hastily tied up in the red handkerchief
taken from a peasant's neck, said to the man who was next to him, but whom he did not at the
moment perceive to be Denot:

"Look at Larochejaquelin, the gallant fellow; look at the red scarf on the castle wall. I could
swear to him among a thousand."

"Yes," said Adolphe, unwilling not to reply when spoken to, and yet ashamed to speak to de
Lescure, "yes, that is Henri. I wish I were with him."

"Oh, that is you, is it?" said de Lescure, just turning to look at him, and then hurrying away.
But before he had moved on five paces, he returned, and putting his pistol into his girdle,
gave Adolphe his left hand, and whispered to him:

"No one shall ever hear of it, Adolphe," said he, "and I will forget it. Think of your Saviour
in such moments, Adolphe, and your heart will not fail you again."

The tears came into Denot's eyes as de Lescure left him. He felt that he must be despised;
he felt grateful for the promise which had been given him, and yet he felt a kind of hatred
for the man to whom he had afforded an opportunity of forgiving him. He felt that he never
could like de Lescure again, never be happy in his company; he knew that de Lescure would religiously
keep his word, that he would never mention to human being that horrid passage at the bridge;
but he knew also that it could never be forgotten. Adolphe Denot was not absolutely a coward;
he had not bragged that he would do anything which he knew it was contrary to his nature to
do, when he told Agatha that he would be the first to place the white flag on the citadel of
Saumur: he felt then all the aspirations of a brave man; he felt a desire even to hurry into
the thick of the battle; but he had not the assured, sustained courage to support him in the
moment of extreme danger. As de Lescure said, his heart failed him.
