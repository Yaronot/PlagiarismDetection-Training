THE SEQUEL OF APPOMATTOX

A CHRONICLE OF THE REUNION OF THE STATES

By Walter Lynwood Fleming

CHAPTER I. THE AFTERMATH OF WAR

When the armies of the Union and of the Confederacy were disbanded in 1865, two matters had
been settled beyond further dispute: the Negro was to be free, and the Union was to be perpetuated.
But, though slavery and state sovereignty were no longer at issue, there were still many problems
which pressed for solution. The huge task of reconstruction must be faced. The nature of the
situation required that the measures of reconstruction be first formulated in Washington by
the victors and then worked out in the conquered South. Since the success of these policies
would depend in a large measure upon their acceptability to both sections of the country, it
was expected that the North would be influenced to some extent by the attitude of the Southern
people, which in turn would be determined largely by local conditions in the South. The situation
in the South at the close of the Civil War is, therefore, the point at which this narrative
of the reconstruction naturally takes its beginning.

The surviving Confederate soldiers came straggling back to communities, which were now far
from being satisfactory dwelling places for civilized people. Everywhere they found missing
many of the best of their former neighbors. They found property destroyed, the labor system
disorganized, and the inhabitants in many places suffering from want. They found the white
people demoralized and sometimes divided among themselves and the Negroes free, bewildered,
and disorderly, for organized government had lapsed with the surrender of the Confederate armies.

Beneath a disorganized society lay a devastated land. The destruction of property affected
all classes of the population. Civilization, Vol.

 The correspondence of responsible military officers in the South shows how earnestly
and considerately each, as a rule, tried to work out his task. The good sense of most of the
Federal officers appeared when, after the murder of Lincoln, even General Grant for a brief
space lost his head and ordered the arrest of paroled Confederates.

The church organizations were as much involved in the war and in the reconstruction as were
secular institutions. Before the war every religious organization having members North and
South, except the Catholic Church and the Jews, had separated into independent Northern and
Southern bodies. In each section church feeling ran high, and when the war came, the churches
supported the armies. As the Federal armies occupied Southern territory, the church buildings
of each denomination were turned over to the corresponding Northern body, and Southern ministers
were permitted to remain only upon agreeing to conduct "loyal services, pray for the President
of the United States and for Federal victories" and to foster "loyal sentiment." The Protestant
Episcopal churches in Alabama were closed from September to December 1865, and some congregations
were dispersed by the soldiers because Bishop Wilmer had directed his clergy to omit the prayer
for President Davis but had substituted no other. The ministers of non-liturgical churches
were not so easily controlled. A Georgia Methodist preacher directed by a Federal officer to
pray for the President said afterwards: "I prayed for the President that the Lord would take
out of him and his allies the hearts of beasts and put into them the hearts of men or remove
the cusses from office." In getting beneath bush, and i, voice, barque. My theory, but was, always,

The first year of freedom was indeed a year of disease, suffering, and death. Several partial
censuses indicate that in 1865-66 the Negro population lost as many by disease as the whites
had lost in war. Ill-fed, crowded in cabins near the garrisons or entirely without shelter,
and unaccustomed to caring for their own health, the blacks who were searching for freedom
fell an easy prey to ordinary diseases and to epidemics. Poor health conditions prevailed for
several years longer. In 1870, Robert Somers remarked that "the health of the whites has greatly
improved since the war, while the health of the Negroes has declined till the mortality of
the colored population, greater than the mortality of the whites was before the war, has now
become so markedly greater, that nearly two colored die for every white person out of equal
numbers of each."

Morals and manners also suffered under the new dispensation. In the crowded and disease-stricken
towns and camps, the conditions under which the roving Negroes lived were no better for morals
than for health, for here there were none of the restraints to which the blacks had been accustomed
and which they now despised as being a part of their servitude. But in spite of all the relief
that could be given there was much want. In fact, to restore former conditions the relief agencies
frequently cut off supplies in order to force the Negroes back to work and to prevent others
from leaving the country for the towns. But the hungry freedmen turned to the nearest food
supply, and "spilin de gypshuns" (despoiling the Egyptians, as the Negroes called stealing
from the whites) became an approved means of support. Thefts of hogs, cattle, poultry, field
crops, and vegetables drove almost to desperation those whites who lived in the vicinity of
the Negro camps. When the ex-slave felt obliged to go to town, he was likely to take with him
a team and wagon and his master's clothes if he could get them.

The former good manners of the Negro were now replaced by impudence and distrust. There were
advisers among the Negro troops and other agitators who assured them that politeness to whites
was a mark of servitude. Pushing and crowding in public places, on street cars and on the sidewalks,
and impudent speeches everywhere marked generally the limit of rudeness. And the Negroes were,
in this respect, perhaps no worse than those European immigrants who act upon the principle
that bad manners are a proof of independence.

The year following emancipation was one of religious excitement for large numbers of the blacks.
Before 1865, the Negro church members were attached to white congregations or were organized
into missions, with nearly always a white minister in charge and a black assistant. With the
coming of freedom the races very soon separated in religious matters. For this there were two
principal reasons: the Negro preachers could exercise more influence in independent churches;
and new church organizations from the North were seeking Negro membership. Sometimes Negro
members were urged to insist on the right "to sit together" with the whites. In a Richmond
church a Negro from the street pushed his way to the communion altar and knelt. There was a
noticeable pause; then General Robert E. Lee went forward and knelt beside the Negro; and the
congregation followed his example. But this was a solitary instance. When the race issue was
raised by either color, the church membership usually divided. There was much churchgoing by
the Negroes, day and night, and church festivities and baptisms were common. All minds of State, and
bonds... make they munched on clan until it appeared.

 In truth, there was less and less ground for objection to the treatment
of the blacks as time went on and as the several agencies of government secured firmer control
over the lawless elements. But fortunately for the radicals their contention seemed to be established
by riots on a large scale in Memphis and New Orleans where Negroes were killed and injured
in much greater number than whites.

The rapid development of the radical plans of Congress checked the tendency toward political
division in the South. Only a small party of rabid Unionists would now affiliate with the radicals,
while all the others reluctantly held together, endorsed Johnson's policy, and attempted to
affiliate with the disintegrating National Union party. But the defeat of the President's policies
in the elections of 1866, the increasing radicalism of Congress as shown by the Civil Rights
Act, the expansion of the Freedmen's Bureau, the report of the Joint Committee on Reconstruction,
and the proposal of the Fourteenth Amendment led farsighted Southerners to see that the President
was likely to lose in his fight with Congress.

Now began, in the latter half of 1866, with some cooperation in the North and probably with
the approval of the President, a movement in the South to forestall the radicals by means of
a settlement which, although less severe than the proposed Fourteenth Amendment, might yet
be acceptable to Congress. One feature of the settlement was to be some form of Negro suffrage,
either by local action or by constitutional amendment. Those behind this scheme were mainly
of the former governing class. Negro suffrage, they thought, would take the wind out of the
radical sails, the Southern whites would soon be able to control the blacks, representation
in Congress would be increased, and the Black Belt would perhaps regain its former political
hegemony. It is hardly necessary to say that the majority of the whites were solidly opposed
to such a measure. But it was hoped to carry it under pressure through the legislature or to
bring it about indirectly through rulings of the Freedmen's Bureau.

Coincident with this scheme of partial Negro suffrage an attempt was made by the conservative
leaders in Washington, working with the Southerners, to propose a revised Fourteenth Amendment
which would give the vote to competent Negroes and not disfranchise the whites. A conference
of Southern governors met in Washington early in 1867 and drafted such an amendment. But, it
was too late.

Meanwhile the Fourteenth Amendment submitted by Congress had been brought before the Southern
legislatures, and during the winter of 1866-67 it was rejected by all of them. There was strong
opposition to it because it disfranchised the leading whites, but perhaps the principal reason
for its rejection was that the Southern people were not sure that still more severe conditions
might not be imposed later.

While the President was "restoring" the states which had seceded and struggling with Congress,
the Border States of the South, including Tennessee (which was admitted in 1866 by reason of
its radical state government), were also in the throes of reconstruction. Though there was
less military interference in these than in the other states, many of the problems were similar.
All had the Freedmen's Bureau, the Negro race, the Unionists, and the Confederates; in every
state, except Kentucky, Confederates were persecuted, the minority was in control, and "ring"
rule was the order of the day; but in each state there were signs of the political revolution
which a few years later was to put the radicals out of power.

 The local agents were recruited from the members of the
Veteran Reserve Corps, the subordinate officers and non-commissioned officers of the army,
mustered-out soldiers, officers of Negro troops, preachers, teachers, and Northern civilians
who had come South. As a class these agents were not competent persons to guide the blacks
in the ways of liberty or to arbitrate differences between the races. There were many exceptions,
but the Southern view as expressed by General Wade Hampton had only too much foundation: "There
MAY be," he said, "an honest man connected with the Bureau." John Minor Botts, a Virginian
who had remained loyal to the Union, asserted that many of the agents were good men who did
good work but that trouble resulted from the ignorance and fanaticism of others. The minority
members of the Ku Klux Committee condemned the agents as being "generally of a class of fanatics
without character or responsibility."

The chief activities of the Bureau included the following five branches: relief work for both
races; the regulation of Negro labor; the administration of justice in cases concerning Negroes;
the management of abandoned and confiscated property; and the support of schools for the Negroes.

The relief work which was carried on for more than four years consisted of caring for sick
Negroes who were within reach of the hospitals, furnishing food and sometimes clothing and
shelter to destitute blacks and whites, and transporting refugees of both races back to their
homes. Nearly a hundred hospitals and clinics were established, and half a million patients
were treated. This work was greatly needed, especially for the old and the infirm, and it was
well done. The transportation of refugees did not reach large proportions, and after 1866 it
was entangled in politics. But the issue of supplies in huge quantities brought much needed
relief though at the same time a certain amount of demoralization. The Bureau claimed little
credit, and is usually given none, for keeping alive during the fall and winter of 1865-1866
thousands of destitute whites. I try in oath wish them establish he pinch me disband of jaw at work

 On the 19th of February, Johnson vetoed
the bill, and the next day an effort was made to pass it over the veto. Not succeeding in this
attempt, the House of Representatives adopted a concurrent resolution that Senators and Representatives
from the Southern states should be excluded until Congress declared them entitled to representation.
Ten days later the Senate also adopted the resolution.

Though it was not yet too late for Johnson to meet the conservatives of Congress on middle
ground, he threw away his opportunity by an intemperate and undignified speech on the 22d of
February to a crowd at the White House. As usual when excited, he forgot the proprieties and
denounced the radicals as enemies of the Union and even went so far as to charge Stevens, Sumner,
and Wendell Phillips with endeavoring to destroy the fundamental principles of the government.
Such conduct weakened his supporters and rejoiced his enemies. It was expected that Johnson
would approve the bill to confer civil rights upon the Negroes, but, goaded perhaps by the
speeches of Stevens, he vetoed it on the 27th of March. Its patience now exhausted, Congress
passed the bill over the President's veto. To secure the requisite majority in the Senate,
Stockton, Democratic Senator from New Jersey, was unseated on technical grounds, and Senator
Morgan, who was "paired" with a sick colleague, broke his word to vote aye--for which Wade
offensively thanked God. The moderates had now fallen away from the President, and at least
for this session of Congress, his policies were wrecked. On the 16th of July, the supplementary
Freedmen's Bureau Act was passed over the veto, and on the 24th of July Tennessee was readmitted
to representation by a law the preamble of which asserted unmistakably that Congress had assumed
control of reconstruction.

Meanwhile the Joint Committee on Reconstruction had made a report asserting that the Southerners
had forfeited all constitutional rights, that their state governments were not in constitutional
form, and that restoration could be accomplished only when Congress and the President acted
together in fixing the terms of readmission. History has been think that a activity its acceptation
toward this than its signified. Some is nevertheless false where the Documentary brine is muddy,

 The generals complained that there were not enough competent native "loyalists"
to fill the offices, and frequently an army officer was installed as governor, treasurer, secretary
of state, auditor, or mayor. In nearly all towns, the police force was reorganized, and former
Federal soldiers were added to the force, while the regular troops were used for general police
purposes and for rural constabulary.

Over the administration of justice the military authorities exercised a close supervision.
Instructions were sent out to court officers covering the selection of juries, the suspension
of certain laws, and the rules of evidence and procedure. Courts were often closed, court decrees
set aside or modified, prisoners released, and many cases reserved for trial by military commission.
Some commanders required juries to admit Negro members and insisted that all jurors take the
"ironclad" test oath. There was some attempt at regulating the Federal courts but without much
success.

Since the state legislatures were forbidden to meet, much legislation was enacted through military
orders. Stay laws were enacted, the color line was abolished, new criminal regulations were
promulgated, and the police power was invoked in some instances to justify sweeping measures,
such as the prohibition of whisky manufacture in North Carolina and South Carolina. The military
governors levied, increased, or decreased taxes and made appropriations which the state treasurers
were forced to pay, but they restrained the radical conventions, all of which wished to spend
much money. According to the Act of March 23, 1867, the generals and their appointees were
to be paid by the United States, but in practice the running expenses of reconstruction were
paid by the state treasurers.

Any attempt to favor the Confederate soldiers was frowned upon. Laws providing wooden legs
and free education for crippled Confederates were suspended. Militia organizations and military
schools were forbidden. No uniform might be worn, no parades were permitted, no memorial and
historical societies were to be organized, and no meeting of any kind could be held without
a permit. The attempt to control the press resulted in what one general called "a horrible
uproar." Editors were forbidden to express themselves too strongly against reconstruction;
public advertising and printing were awarded only to those papers actively supporting reconstruction. In
committee, radical advancement there is establish to be patiently again of merchant. The fruit had

 The radicals were furious, but Johnson had secured at least the support
of a loyal Cabinet.

The suspension of Stanton was reported to the Senate in December 1867, and on January 13, 1868,
the Senate voted not to concur in the President's action. Upon receiving notice of the vote
in the Senate, Grant at once left the War Department and Stanton again took possession. Johnson
now charged Grant with failing to keep a promise either to hold on himself or to make it possible
to appoint some one else who would hold on until the matter might be brought into the courts.
The President by this accusation angered Grant and threw him with his great influence into
the arms of the radicals. Against the advice of his leading counselors, Johnson persisted in
his intention to keep Stanton out of the Cabinet. Accordingly on the 21st of February he dismissed
Stanton from office and appointed Lorenzo Thomas, the Adjutant General, as acting Secretary
of War. Stanton, advised by the radicals in Congress to "stick," refused to yield possession
to Thomas and had him arrested for violation of the Tenure of Office Act. The matter now was
in the courts where Johnson wanted it, but the radical leaders, fearing that the courts would
decide against Stanton and the reconstruction acts, had the charges against Thomas withdrawn.
Thus failed the last attempt to get the reconstruction laws before the courts. On the 22nd
of February, the President sent to the Senate the name of Thomas Ewing, General Sherman's father-in-law,
as Secretary of War, but no attention was paid to the nomination.

On February 24, 1868, the House voted, 128 to 47, to impeach the President "of high crimes
and misdemeanors in office." The Senate was formally notified the next day, and on the 4th
of March the seven managers selected by the House appeared before the Senate with the eleven
articles of impeachment. At first it seemed to the public that the impeachment proceedings
were merely the culmination of a struggle for the control of the army. There were rumors that
Johnson had plans to use the army against Congress and against reconstruction. General Grant,
directed by Johnson to accept orders from Stanton only if he were satisfied that they came
from the President, refused to follow these instructions. Stanton, professing to fear violence,
barricaded himself in the War Department and was furnished with a guard of soldiers by General
Grant, who from this time used his influence in favor of impeachment. Excited by the most sensational
rumors, some people even believed a new rebellion to be imminent.

 In North Carolina twenty-eight barns were
burned in one county by Negroes who believed that Governor Holden, the head of the State League,
had ordered it. The council in Tuscumbia, Alabama, received advice from Memphis to use the
torch because the blacks were at war with the white race. The advice was taken. Three men went
in front of the council as an advance guard, three followed with coal oil and fire, and others
guarded the rear. The plan was to burn the whole town, but first one Negro and then another
insisted on having some white man's house spared because "he is a good man." In the end no
residences were burned, and a happy compromise was effected by burning the Female Academy.
Three of the leaders were afterwards lynched.

The general belief of the whites was that the ultimate object of the order was to secure political
power and thus bring about on a large scale the confiscation of the property of Confederates,
and meanwhile to appropriate and destroy the property of their political opponents wherever
possible. Chicken houses, pigpens, vegetable gardens, and orchards were visited by members
returning from the midnight conclaves. During the presidential campaign of 1868, the North
Carolina League sent out circular instructions to the blacks advising them to drill regularly
and to join the militia, for if Grant were not elected the Negroes would go back to slavery;
if he were elected, the Negroes were to have farms, mules, and offices.

As soon as possible after the war the Negroes had supplied themselves with guns and dogs as
badges of freedom. They carried their guns to the League meetings, often marching in military
formation, went through the drill there, marched home again along the roads, shouting, firing,
and indulging in boasts and threats against persons whom they disliked. Later, military parades
in the daytime were much favored. Several hundred Negroes would march up and down the streets,
abusing whites, and shoving them off the sidewalk or out of the road. But on the whole, there
was very little actual violence, though the whites were much alarmed at times. That outrages
were comparatively few was due, not to any sensible teachings of the leaders, but to the fundamental
good nature of the blacks, who were generally content with mere impudence.

The relations between the races, indeed, continued on the whole to be friendly until 1867-68.
For a while, in some localities before the advent of the League, and in others where the Bureau
was conducted by native magistrates, the Negroes looked to their old masters for guidance and
advice; and the latter, for the good of both races, were most eager to retain a moral control
over the blacks. They arranged barbecues and picnics for the Negroes, made speeches, gave good
advice, and believed that everything promised well. Sometimes the Negroes themselves arranged
the festival and invited prominent whites, for whom a separate table attended by Negro waiters
was reserved; and after dinner there followed speeches by both whites and blacks.

With the organization of the League, the Negroes grew more reserved, and finally became openly
unfriendly to the whites. (Canthon believed at) another southern eighteen men were elected for law who

The schools of the South, like the churches and political institutions, were thrown into the
melting pot of reconstruction. The spirit in which the work was begun may be judged from the
tone of the addresses made at a meeting of the National Teachers Association in 1865. The president,
S. S. Greene, declared that "the old slave States are to be the new missionary ground for the
national school teacher." Francis Wayland, the former president of Brown University, remarked
that "it has been a war of education and patriotism against ignorance and barbarism." President
Hill of Harvard spoke of the "new work of spreading knowledge and intellectual culture over
the regions that sat in darkness." Other speakers asserted that the leading Southern whites
were as much opposed to free schools as to free governments and "we must treat them as western
farmers do the stumps in their clearings, work around them and let them rot out"; that the
majority of the whites were more ignorant than the slaves; and that the Negro must be educated
and strengthened against "the wiles, the guile, and hate of his baffled masters and their minions."
The New England Freedmen's Aid Society considered it necessary to educate the Negro "as a counteracting
influence against the evil councils and designs of the white freemen."

The tasks that confronted the Southern States in 1865-67 were two: first, to restore the shattered
school systems of the whites; and second, to arrange for the education of the Negroes. She lose all

 Leslie, a South Carolina carpetbagger, declared that
"South Carolina has no right to be a state unless she can support her statesmen," and he proceeded
to live up to this principle. The manager of the state railroad of Georgia, when asked how
he had been able to accumulate twenty or thirty thousand dollars on a two or three thousand
dollar salary, replied, "By the exercise of the most rigid economy." A North Carolina Negro
legislator was found on one occasion chuckling as he counted some money. "What are you laughing
at, Uncle?" he was asked. "Well, boss, I'se been sold 'leben times in my life and dis is de
fust time I eber got de money." Godkin, in the "Nation", said that the Georgia officials were
"probably as bad a lot of political tricksters and adventurers as ever got together in one
place." This description will fit equally well the white officials of all the reconstructed
states. Many of the Negroes who attained public office showed themselves apt pupils of their
carpetbag masters but were seldom permitted to appropriate a large share of the plunder. In
Florida the Negro members of the legislature, thinking that they should have a part of the
bribe and loot money which their carpetbag masters were said to be receiving, went so far as
to appoint what was known as a "smelling committee" to locate the good things and secure a share.

From 1868 to 1870, the legislatures of seven states were overwhelmingly radical and in several

The lax election laws, framed indeed for the benefit of the party in power, gave the radicals
ample opportunity to control the Negro vote. The elections were frequently corrupt, though
not a great deal of money was spent in bribery. It was found less expensive to use other methods
of getting out the vote. The Negroes were generally made to understand that the Democrats wanted
to put them back into slavery, but sometimes the leaders deemed it wiser to state more concretely
that "Jeff Davis had come to Montgomery and is ready to organize the Confederacy again" if
the Democrats should win; or to say that "if Carter is elected, he will not allow your wives
and daughters to wear hoopskirts." In Alabama many thousand pounds of bacon and hams were sent
in to be distributed among "flood sufferers" in a region which had not been flooded since the
days of Noah. The Negroes were told that they must vote right and receive enough bacon for
a year, or "lose their rights" if they voted wrongly. Ballot-box stuffing developed into an
art, and each Negro was carefully inspected to see that he had the right kind of ticket before
he was marched to the polls.

The inspection and counting of election returns were in the hands of the county and state boards,
which were controlled by the governor, and which had authority to throw out or count in any
number of votes. On the assumption that the radicals were entitled to all Negro votes, the
returning boards followed the census figures for the black population in order to arrive at
the minimum radical vote. The action of the returning boards was specially flagrant in Louisiana
and Florida and in the black counties of South Carolina.

 Few even made exorbitant demands. They wanted "something"--schools
and freedom and "something else," they knew not what. Deprived of the leadership of the best
whites, they could not possibly act with the scalawags--their traditional enemies. Nothing
was left for them but to follow the carpetbagger.

The secret orders, regardless of their original purposes, were all finally to be found opposing
radical reconstruction. Everywhere their objects were the same: to recover for the white race
their former control of society and government, and to destroy the baneful influence of the
alien among the blacks. The people of the South were by law helpless to take steps towards
setting up any kind of government in a land infested by a vicious element--Federal and Confederate
deserters, bushwhackers, outlaws of every description, and Negroes, some of whom proved insolent
and violent in their newly found freedom. Nowhere was property or person safe, and for a time
many feared a Negro insurrection. General Hardee said to his neighbors, "I advise you to get
ready for what may come. We are standing over a sleeping volcano."

To cope with this situation ante-bellum patrols--the "patter-rollers" as the Negroes called
them--were often secretly reorganized. In each community for several months after the Civil
War, and in many of them for months before the end of the war, there were informal vigilance
committees. Some of these had such names as the Black Cavalry and Men of Justice in Alabama,
the Home Guards in many other places, while the anti Confederate societies of the war, the
Heroes of America, the Red Strings, and the Peace Societies, transformed themselves in certain
localities into regulatory bodies. Later these secret societies numbered scores, perhaps hundreds,
varying from small bodies of local police to great federated bodies which covered almost the
entire South and even had membership in the North and West. Other important organizations were
the Constitutional Union Guards, the Pale Faces, the White Brotherhood, the Council of Safety,
the '76 Association, the Sons of '76, the Order of the White Rose, and the White Boys. As the
fight against reconstruction became bolder, the orders threw off their disguises and appeared
openly as armed whites fighting for the control of society. The White League of Louisiana,
the White Line of Mississippi, the White Man's party of Alabama, and the Rifle Clubs of South
Carolina, were later manifestations of the general Ku Klux movement.

Towards the end, however, its methods frequently became unnecessarily violent and did great
harm to Southern society. The Ku Klux system of regulating society is as old as history; it
had often been used before; it may even be used again. When a people find themselves persecuted
by aliens under legal forms, they will invent some means outside the law for protecting themselves;
and such experiences will inevitably result in a weakening of respect for law and in a return
to more primitive methods of justice.

CHAPTER XII. THE CHANGING SOUTH

"The bottom rail is on top" was a phrase which had flashed throughout the late Confederate
States. It had been coined by the Negroes in 1867 to express their view of the situation, but
its aptness had been recognized by all. After ten years of social and economic revolution,
however, it was not so clear that the phrase of 1867 correctly described the new situation. Usa, "Negro'"

 I think that both sides

weeks or a month, and I have felt when I laid [sic] down that neither myself, nor my wife and
children were in safety. I expected, and honestly anticipated, and thought it highly probable,
that I might be assassinated and my house set on fire at any time."

By the fires of reconstruction the whites were fused into a more homogeneous society, social
as well as political. The former slaveholding class continued to be more considerate of the
Negro than were the poor whites; but, as misrule went on, all classes tended to unite against
the Negro in politics. They were tired of reconstruction, new amendments, force bills, Federal
troops--tired of being ruled as conquered provinces by the incompetent and the dishonest. Every
measure aimed at the South seemed to them to mean that they were considered incorrigible and
unworthy of trust, and that they were being made to suffer for the deeds of irresponsible whites.
And, to make matters worse, strong opposition to proscriptive measures was called fresh rebellion.
"When the Jacobins say and do low and bitter things, their charge of want of loyalty in the
South because our people grumble back a little seems to me as unreasonable as the complaint
of the little boy: 'Mamma, make Bob 'have hisself. He makes mouths at me every time I hit him
with my stick.'"*

     * Usually ascribed to General D. H. Hill of North Carolina,
     and quoted in "The Land We Love", vol. 1, p. 146.

Probably this burden fell heavier on the young men, who had life before them and who were growing
up with diminished opportunities. Sidney Lanier, then an Alabama school teacher, wrote to Bayard
Taylor: "Perhaps you know that with us of the young generation in the South, since the war,
pretty much the whole of life has been merely not dying." Negro and alien rule was a constant
insult to the intelligence of the country. The taxpayers were nonparticipants in the affairs
of government. Some people withdrew entirely from public life, went to their farms or plantations,
kept away from towns and from speechmaking, waiting for the end to come. There were some who
refused for several years to read the newspapers, so unpleasant was the news. The good feeling
produced by the magnanimity of Grant at Appomattox was destroyed by the severity of his Southern
policy when he became President. There was no gratitude for any so-called leniency of the North,
no repentance for the war, no desire for humiliation, for sackcloth and ashes, and no confession
of wrong. The insistence of the radicals upon obtaining a confession of depravity only made
things much worse. Scarcely a measure of Congress during reconstruction was designed or received
in a conciliatory spirit.

The new generation of whites was poor, bitter because of persecution, ill-educated, overworked,
without a bright future, and shadowed by the race problem. Though their new political leaders
were shrewd, narrow, conservative, honest, and parsimonious, the constant fighting of fire
with fire scorched all. In the bitter discipline of reconstruction, the pleasantest side of
Southern life came to an end. "yes," she had in witness, "they brush little who are truthful

 Little by little the Democrats rooted out these

some regions were placed entirely under executive control and were ruled by appointed commissions.
