  'Great is my esteem of the maiden
     Towards whose dwelling the north wind blows;
   She is ever cheerful, sportive, kindly,
     Without folly, without vanity, without pride.
   True is her heart--were I under hiding,
     And fifty men in pursuit of my footsteps,
   I should find protection, when they surrounded me most
            closely,
     In the secret recess of that shieling.
                       EASY IS MY BED, ETC.

  'Oh for the day for turning my face homeward,
     That I may see the maiden of beauty--
   Joyful will it be to me to be with thee,
     Fair girl with the long heavy locks!
   Choice of all places for deer-hunting
     Are the brindled rock and the ridge!
   How sweet at evening to be dragging the slain deer
     Downwards along the piper's cairn!
                       EASY IS MY BED, ETC.

  'Great is my esteem for the maiden
     Who parted from me by the west side of the enclosed field;
   Late yet again will she linger in that fold,
     Long after the kine are assembled.
   It is I myself who have taken no dislike to thee,
     Though far away from thee am I now.
   It is for the thought of thee that sleep flies from me;
     Great is the profit to me of thy parting kiss!
                        EASY IS MY BED, ETC.

  'Dear to me are the boundaries of the forest;
     Far from Creiff is my heart;
   My remembrance is of the hillocks of sheep,
     And the heath of many knolls.
   Oh for the red-streaked fissures of the rock,
     Where in spring time the fawns leap;
   Oh for the crags towards which the wind is blowing--
     Cheap would be my bed to be there!
                        EASY IS MY BED, ETC.'

"The following describes Rob's feelings on the first discovery of his damsel's infidelity.
The airs of both these pieces are his own, and, the Highland ladies say, very beautiful.

  'Heavy to me is the shieling, and the hum that is in it,
   Since the ear that was wont to listen is now no more on the
        watch.
   Where is Isabel, the courteous, the conversable, a sister in
        kindness?
   Where is Anne, the slender-browed, the turret-breasted, whose
        glossy hair pleased me when yet a boy?
   HEICH!  WHAT AN HOUR WAS MY RETURNING!
   PAIN SUCH AS THAT SUNSET BROUGHT, WHAT AVAILETH ME TO TELL IT?

  'I traversed the fold, and upward among the trees--
   Each place, far and near, wherein I was wont to salute my
        love.
   When I looked down from the crag, and beheld the fair-haired
        stranger dallying with his bride,
   I wished I had never revisited the glen of my dreams.
   SUCH THINGS CAME INTO MY HEART AS THAT SUN WAS GOING DOWN,
   A PAIN OF WHICH I SHALL NEVER BE RID, WHAT AVAILETH ME TO TELL
        IT?

  'Since it has been heard that the carpenter had persuaded thee,
   My sleep is disturbed--busy is foolishness within me at
        midnight.
   The kindness that has been between us, I cannot shake off that
        memory in visions;
   Thou callest me not to thy side; but love is to me for a
        messenger.
   THERE IS STRIFE WITHIN ME, AND I TOSS TO BE AT LIBERTY;
   AND EVER THE CLOSER IT CLINGS, AND THE DELUSION IS GROWING TO
        ME AS A TREE.

  'Anne, yellow-haired daughter of Donald, surely thou knowest
        not how it is with me--
   That it is old love, unrepaid, which has worn down from me my
        strength;
   That when far from thee, beyond many mountains, the wound in
        my heart was throbbing,
   Stirring, and searching for ever, as when I sat beside thee on
        the turf.
   NOW, THEN, HEAR ME THIS ONCE, IF FOR EVER I AM TO BE WITHOUT
        THEE,
   MY SPIRIT IS BROKEN--GIVE ME ONE KISS ERE I LEAVE THIS LAND!
