She was not an uncommon woman; he was not an unusual man.  They were not happy, they might
never be; he was almost sure they would not be; she had long ceased to think they could be.
She had told him when she married him that she did not love him.  He had been willing to wait
for her love, believing that by patience and devotion he could win it.  They were both sorry
for each other now.  They accepted things as they were, but they knew there was danger in the
situation.  She loved some one else, and he knew it, but he had never spoken to her of it--he
was of too good stuff for that.  He was big and burly, and something awkward in his ways. 
She was pretty, clear- minded, kind, and very grave.  There were days when they were both bitter
at heart.  On one such day they sat at luncheon, eating little, and looking much out of the
door across the rice fields and banana plantations to the Hebron Mountains.  The wife's eyes
fixed on the hills and stayed.  A road ran down the hill towards a platform of rock which swept
smooth and straight to the sheer side of the mountain called White Bluff.  At first glance
it seemed that the road ended at the cliff-- a mighty slide to destruction.  Instead, however,
of coming straight to the cliff it veered suddenly, and ran round the mountain side, coming
down at a steep but fairly safe incline.  The platform or cliff was fenced off by a low barricade
of fallen trees, scarcely noticeable from the valley below.  The wife's eyes had often wandered
to the spot with a strange fascination, as now.  Her husband looked at her meditatively. He
nodded slightly, as though to himself.  She looked up.  Their understanding of each other's
thoughts was singular.

"Tom," she said, "I will ride the chestnut, Bowline, to that fence some day.  It will be a
big steeplechase."  He winced, but answered slowly. "You have meant to say that for a long
time past.  I am glad it has been said at last."

She was struck by the perfect quietness of his tone.  Her eyes sought his face and rested for
a moment, half bewildered, half pitying.

"Yes, it has been in my mind often--often," she said.  "It's a horrible thought," he gravely
replied; "but it is better to be frank.  Still, you'll never do it, Alice--you'll never dare
to do it."

"Dare, dare," she answered, springing to her feet, and a shuddering sigh broke from her.  "The
thing itself is easy enough, Tom."

"And why haven't you done it?" he asked in a hard voice, but still calmly.

She leaned one hand upon the table, the other lay at her cheek, and her head bent forward at
him.  "Because," she answered, "because I have tried to be thoughtful for you."

"Oh, as to that," he said--"as to that!" and he shrugged his shoulders slightly.

"You don't care a straw," she said sharply, "you never did."

He looked up suddenly at her, a great bitterness in his face, and laughed strangely, as he
answered: "Care!  Good God!  Care!  .  .  .  What's the use of caring?  It's been all a mistake;
all wrong."

"That is no news," she said wearily.  "You discovered that long ago."

He looked out of the door across the warm fields again; he lifted his eyes to that mountain
road; he looked down at her.  "I haven't any hope left now, Alice.  Let's be plain with each
other.  We've always been plain, but let us be plainer still.  There are those rice fields
out there, that banana plantation, and the sugar-cane stretching back as far as the valley
goes--it's all mine, all mine.  I worked hard for it.  I had only one wish with it all, one
hope through it all, and it was, that when I brought you here as my wife, you would come to
love me--some time. Well, I've waited, and waited.  It hasn't come.  We're as far apart to-
day as we were the day I married you.  Farther, for I had hope then, but I've no hope now,
none at all."

  The request was emphasised by the presence of a revolver
held at an easy but suggestive angle.  The disadvantage to the squatter was obvious.  He merely
asked that he should be permitted to keep the ring, as it had many associations, remarking
at the same time that he would be pleased to give an equivalent for it if the bushranger would
come to Wandenong.  At the mention of Wandenong the highwayman asked his name.  On being told,
he handed back the money, the watch, and the ring, and politely requested a cigar, saying that
the Osgoods merited consideration at his hands, and that their friends were safe from molestation.
Then he added, with some grim humour, that if Druce had no objection to spending an hour with
Roadmaster over a fire and a billy of tea, he would be glad of his company; for bushranging,
according to his system, was but dull work. The young squatter consented, and together they
sat for two hours, the highwayman, however, never removing his mask.  They talked of many things,
and at last Druce ventured to ask his companion about the death of Blood Finchley, the owner
of Tarawan sheep-run.  At this Roadmaster became weary, and rose to leave; but as if on second
thought, he said that Finchley's companion, whom he allowed to go unrobbed and untouched, was
both a coward and a liar; that the slain man had fired thrice needlessly, and had wounded him
in the neck (the scar of which he showed) before he drew trigger.  Druce then told him that
besides a posse of police, a number of squatters and bushmen had banded to hunt him down, and
advised him to make for the coast if he could, and leave the country. At this Roadmaster laughed,
and said that his fancy was not sea-ward yet, though that might come; and then, with a courteous
wave of his hand, he jumped on his horse and rode away.

The Osgoods speculated curiously and futilely on Roadmaster's identity, as indeed the whole
colony had done.  And here it may be said that people of any observation (though, of necessity,
they were few, since Rahway attracted only busy sugar-planters and their workmen) were used
to speak of Louis Bachelor as one who must certainly have a history.  The person most likely
to have the power of inquisition into his affairs was his faithful aboriginal servant, Gongi.
But records and history were only understood by Gongi when they were restricted to the number
of heads taken in tribal battle.  At the same time he was a devoted slave to the man who, at
the risk of his own life, had rescued him from the murderous spears of his aboriginal foes.
That was a kind of record within Gongi's comprehension, from the contemplation of which he
turned to speak of Louis Bachelor as "That fellow budgery marmi b'longin' to me," which, in
civilised language, means "my good master."  Gongi often dilated on this rescue, and he would,
for purposes of illustration, take down from his master's wall an artillery officer's sabre
and show how his assailants had been dispersed.

From the presence of this sword it was not unreasonably assumed that Louis Bachelor had at
some time been in the army.  He was not, however, communicative on this point, though he shrewdly
commented on European wars and rumours of wars when they occurred.  He also held strenuous
opinions of the conduct of Government and the suppression of public evils, based obviously
upon military views of things.  .  For bushrangers he would have a modern Tyburn, but this
and other tragic suggestions lacked conviction when confronted with his verdicts given as Justice
of the Peace.  He pronounced judgments in a grand and airy fashion, but as if he were speaking
by a card, the Don Quixote whose mercy would be vaster than his wrath.  This was the impression
he gave, to, John Osgood on the day when the young squatter introduced himself to Rahway, where
he had come on a mission to its one official.  The young man's father had a taste for many
things; astronomy was his latest, and he had bought from the Government a telescope which,
excellent in its day, had been superseded by others of later official purchase.  He had brought
it to Wandenong, had built a home for it, and had got it into trouble.  He had then sent to
Brisbane for assistance, and the astronomer of the Government had referred him to the postmaster
at Rahway, "Prognosticator" of the meteorological column in The Courier, who would be instructed
to give Mr. Osgood every help, especially as the occultation of Venus was near.  Men do not
send letters by post in a new country when personal communication is possible, and John Osgood
was asked by his father to go to Rahway.  When John wished for the name of this rare official,
the astronomer's letter was handed over with a sarcastic request that the name might be deciphered;
but the son was not more of an antiquary than his father, and he had to leave without it. 
He rode to the coast, and there took a passing steamer to Rahway.  From the sea Rahway looked
a tropical paradise.  The bright green palisades of mangrove on the right crowded down to the
water's edge; on the left was the luxuriance of a tropical jungle; in the centre was an are
of opal shore fringed with cocoa-palms, and beyond the sea a handful of white dwellings.  Behind
was a sweeping monotony of verdure stretching back into the great valley of the Popri, and
over all the heavy languor of the South.

But the beauty was a delusion.  When John Osgood's small boat swept up the sands on the white
crest of a league-long roller, how different was the scene!  He saw a group of dilapidated
huts, a tavern called The Angel's Rest, a blackfellow's hut, and the bareness of three Government
offices, all built on piles, that the white ants should not humble them suddenly to the dust;
a fever-making mangrove swamp, black at the base as the filthiest moat, and tenanted by reptiles;
feeble palms, and a sickly breath creeping from the jungle to mingle with the heavy scent of
the last consignment of augar from the Popri valley.  It brought him to a melancholy standstill,
disturbed at last by Gongi touching him on the arm and pointing towards the post-office.  His
language to Gongi was strong; he called the place by names that were not polite; and even on
the threshold of the official domain said that the Devil would have his last big muster there.
But from that instant his glibness declined.  The squatters are the aristocracy of Australia,
and rural postmasters are not always considered eligible for a dinner-party at Government House;
but when Louis Bachelor came forward to meet his visitor the young fellow's fingers quickly
caught his hat from his head, and an off-hand greeting became a respectful salute.

At first the young man was awed by the presence of the grizzled gentleman, and he struggled
with his language to bring it up to the classic level of the old meteorologist's speech.  Before
they had spoken a dozen words John Osgood said to himself: "What a quaint team he and the Maid
of Honour would make!  It's the same kind of thing in both, with the difference of sex and
circumstance."  The nature of his visitor's business pleased the old man, and infused his courtesy
with warmth.  Yes, he would go to Wandenong with pleasure; the Government had communicated
with him about it; a substitute had been offered; he was quite willing to take his first leave
in four years; astronomy was a great subject, he had a very good and obedient telescope of
his own, though not nearly so large as that at Wandenong; he would telegraph at once to Brisbane
for the substitute to be sent on the following day, and would be ready to start in twenty-four
hours.  After visiting Wandenong he would go to Brisbane for some scientific necessaries--and
so on through smooth parentheses of talk.  Under all the bluntness of the Bush young Osgood
had a refinement which now found expression in an attempt to make himself agreeable--not a
difficult task, since, thanks to his father's tastes and a year or two at college, he had a
smattering of physical science.  He soon won his way to the old man's heart, and to his laboratory,
which had been developed through years of patience and ingenious toil in this desolate spot.

Left alone that evening in Louis Bachelor's sitting-room, John Osgood's eyes were caught by
a portrait on the wall, the likeness of a beautiful girl.  Something about the face puzzled
him.  Where had he seen it?  More than a little of an artist, he began to reproduce the head
on paper.  He put it in different poses; he added to it; he took away from it; he gave it a
child's face, preserving the one striking expression; he made it that of a woman--of an elderly,
grave woman.  Why, what was this? Barbara Golding!  He would not spoil the development of the
drama, of which he now held the fluttering prologue, by any blunt treatment; he would touch
this and that nerve gently to see what past connection there was between:

          "These dim blown birds beneath an alien sky."

He mooned along in this fashion, a fashion in which his bushmen friends would not have known
him, until his host entered.  Then, in that auspicious moment when his own pipe and his companion's
cigarette were being lighted, he said: "I've been amusing myself with drawing since you left,
sir, and I've produced this," handing over the paper.

Louis Bachelor took the sketch, and, walking to the window for better light, said: "Believe
me, I have a profound respect for the artistic talent.  I myself once had--ah!"  He sharply
paused as he saw the pencilled head, and stood looking fixedly at it.  Presently he turned
slowly, came to the portrait on the wall, and compared it with that in his hand.  Then, with
a troubled face, he said: "You have much talent, but it is--it is too old--much too old--and
very sorrowful."

"I intended the face to show age and sorrow, Mr. Bachelor.  Would not the original of that
have both?"

"She had sorrow--she had sorrow, but," and he looked sadly at the sketch again, "it is too
old for her.  Her face was very young--always very young."

"But has she not sorrow now, sir?" the other persisted gently.

The grey head was shaken sadly, and the unsteady voice meditatively murmured: "Such beauty,
such presence!  I was but five-and-thirty then." There was a slight pause, and then, with his
hand touching the young man's shoulder, Louis Bachelor continued: "You are young; you have
a good heart; I know men.  You have the sympathy of the artist--why should I not speak to you?
I have been silent about it so long.  You have brought the past back, I know not how, so vividly!
I dream here, I work here; men come with merchandise and go again; they only bind my tongue;
I am not of them: but you are different, as it seems to me, and young.  God gave me a happy
youth.  My eyes were bright as yours, my heart as fond.  You love-- is it not so?  Ah, you
smile and blush like an honest man.  Well, so much the more I can speak now.  God gave me then
strength and honour and love --blessed be His name!  And then He visited me with sorrow, and,
if I still mourn, I have peace, too, and a busy life."  Here he looked at the sketch again.

"Then I was a soldier.  She was my world.  Ah, true, love is a great thing--a great thing!
She had a brother.  They two with their mother were alone in the world, and we were to be married.
One day at Gibraltar I received a letter from her saying that our marriage could not be; that
she was going away from England; that those lines were her farewell; and that she commended
me to the love of Heaven.  Such a letter it was--so saintly, so unhappy, so mysterious!  When
I could get leave I went to England.  She--they--had gone, and none knew whither; or, if any
of her friends knew, none would speak.  I searched for her everywhere.  At last I came to Australia,
and I am here, no longer searching, but waiting, for there is that above us!"  His lips moved
as if in prayer.  "And this is all I have left of her, except memory," he said, tenderly touching
the portrait.

Warmly, yet with discreet sympathy, the young man rejoined: "Sir, I respect, and I hope I understand,
your confidence."  Then, a little nervously: "Might I ask her name?"

The reply was spoken to the portrait: "Barbara--Barbara Golding."

With Louis Bachelor the young squatter approached Wandenong homestead in some excitement. 
He had said no word to his companion about that Barbara Golding who played such a gracious
part in the home of the Osgoods.  He had arranged the movement of the story to his fancy, but
would it occur in all as he hoped?  With an amiability that was almost malicious in its adroit
suggestiveness, though, to be sure, it was honest, he had induced the soldier to talk of his
past.  His words naturally, and always, radiated to the sun, whose image was now hidden, but
for whose memory no superscription on monument or cenotaph was needed.  Now it was a scrap
of song, then a tale, and again a verse, by which the old soldier was delicately worked upon,
until at last, as they entered the paddocks of Wandenong, stars and telescopes and even Governments
had been forgotten in the personal literature of sentiment.

Yet John Osgood was not quite at his ease.  Now that it was at hand, he rather shrank from
the meeting of these ancient loves.  Apart from all else, he knew that no woman's nerves are
to be trusted.  He hoped fortune would so favour him that he could arrange for the meeting
of the two alone, or, at least, in his presence only.  He had so far fostered this possibility
by arriving at the station at nightfall.  What next?  He turned and looked at the soldier,
a figure out of Hogarth, which even dust and travel left unspoiled.  It was certain that the
two should meet where John Osgood, squatter and romancer, should be prompter, orchestra, and
audience, and he alone.  Vain lad!

When they drew rein the young man took his companion at once to his own detached quarters known
as the Barracks, and then proceeded to the house. After greetings with his family he sought
Barbara Golding, who was in the schoolroom, piously employed, Agnes said, in putting the final
touches to Janet's trousseau.  He went across the square to the schoolroom, and, looking through
the window, saw that she was quite alone.  A few moments later he stood at the schoolroom door
with Louis Bachelor.  With his hand on the latch he hesitated.  Was it not fairer to give some
warning to either?  Too late!  He opened the door and they entered.  She was sewing, and a
book lay open beside her, a faded, but stately little figure whose very garments had an air.
She rose, seeing at first only John Osgood, who greeted her and then said: "Miss Golding, I
have brought you an old friend." 

Enoch and Elias, not without either burial, in an being, are a modest apology shall trust of place,
in their long and life, towards young record being still be on this death, and having a voice
has not be yet been to nullity upon this substance.
  Their eyes met and stayed intent.  This
was not quite what the young man had expected.  At length the soldier bowed low, and the woman
responded gravely.  At this point Osgood withdrew to stand guard at the door.

Barbara Golding's eyes were dim with tears.  The soldier gently said, "I received--" and then
paused.  She raised her eyes to his.  "I received a letter from you five-and-twenty years ago."

"Yes, five-and-twenty years ago."

"I hope you cannot guess what pain it gave me."

"Yes," she answered faintly, "I can conceive it, from the pain it gave to me."

There was a pause, and then he stepped forward and, holding out his hand, said: "Will you permit
me?"  He kissed her fingers courteously, and she blushed.  "I have waited," he added, "for
God to bring this to pass." He say the on which do he grounds his opinions, show, he had been accused

It was caused by act. Though inferior to the "Religio," "he said of his works which better
exemplifies his reading."


"Hush, oh hush!" she interrupted gently.  "Yes, I remember everything."

"There is no power can alter what is come of Heaven," he said, smiling faintly.

She looked with limpid eyes upon him as he bowed over her hand, and she spoke with a sweet
calm: "God be with you, Louis."

Strange as it may seem, John Osgood did not tell his sisters and his family of this romance
which he had brought to the vivid close of a first act.  He felt the more so because Louis
Bachelor had said no word about it, but had only pressed his hand again and again--that he
was somehow put upon his honour, and he thought it a fine thing to stand on a platform of unspoken
compact with this gentleman of a social school unfamiliar to him; from which it may be seen
that cattle-breeding and bullock-driving need not make a man a boor.  What his sisters guessed
when they found that Barbara Golding and the visitor were old friends is another matter; but
they could not pierce their brother's reserve on the point.

No one at Wandenong saw the parting between the two when Louis Bachelor, his task with the
telescope ended, left again for the coast; but indeed it might have been seen by all men, so
outwardly formal was it, even as their brief conversations had been since they met again. 
But is it not known by those who look closely upon the world that there is nothing so tragic
as the formal?

John Osgood accompanied his friend to the sea, but the name of Barbara Golding was not mentioned,
nor was any reference made to her until the moment of parting.  Then the elder man said: "Sir,
your consideration and delicacy of feeling have moved me, and touched her.  We have not been
blind to your singular kindness of heart and courtesy, and--God bless you, my friend!"

On his way back to Wandenong, Osgood heard exciting news of Roadmaster. The word had been passed
among the squatters who had united to avenge Finchley's death that the bushranger was to be
shot on sight, that he should not be left to the uncertainty of the law. But though no safety province,

He had the choice of leaving his native land for ever or going to prison, and he chose the
former.  The sorrow of the crime killed his mother.  From Adelaide, where he and Barbara had
made their new home, he wandered to the far interior and afterwards to Sydney; then came his
imprisonment on a charge of manslaughter, and now he was free- but what a freedom!

With the name of Roadmaster often heard at Wandenong, Barbara Golding's heart had no warning
instinct of who the bushranger was.  She thought only and continuously of the day when her
brother should be released, to begin the race of life again with her.  She had yet to learn
in what manner they come to the finish who make a false start.

Louis Bachelor, again in his place Rahway, tried to drive away his guesses at the truth by
his beloved science.  When sleep would not come at night he rose and worked in his laboratory;
and the sailors of many a passing vessel saw the light of his lamp in the dim hours before
dawn, and spoke of fever in the port of Rahway.  Nor did they speak without reason; fever was
preparing a victim for the sacrifice at Rahway, and Louis Bachelor was fed with its poison
till he grew haggard and weak.

One night he was sending his weather prognostications to Brisbane, when a stranger entered
from the shore.  The old man did not at first look up, and the other leisurely studied him
as the sounder clicked its message. When the key was closed the new-comer said: "Can you send
a message to Brisbane for me?"

"It is after hours; I cannot," was the reply.  "But you were just sending one."

"That was official," and the elder man passed his hand wearily along his forehead.  He was
very pale.  The other drew the telegraph-forms towards him and wrote on one, saying as he did
so: "My business is important;" then handing over what he had written, and, smiling ironically,
added: "Perhaps you will consider that official."

Louis Bachelor took the paper and read as follows: To the Colonial Secretary, Brisbane.  I
am here tonight; to-morrow find me.  Roadmaster." He read it twice before he fully comprehended
it.  Then he said, as if awakening from a dream: "You are--"

"I am Roadmaster," said the other.

But now the soldier and official in the other were awake. That the ai wood in arms door not its conception

  "You

Well, I'm going to be out of the way.  I'm going to leave this country, and she's to think
I'm dead, you see."

At this point Louis Bachelor swayed, and would have fallen, but that the bushranger's arms
were thrown round him and helped him to a chair.  "I'm afraid that I am ill," he said; "call
Gongi.  Ah!"  He had fainted.

The bushranger carried him to a bed, and summoned Gongi and the woman from the tavern, and
in another hour was riding away through the valley of the Popri.  Before thirty-six hours had
passed a note was delivered to a station-hand at Wandenong addressed to Barbara Golding, and
signed by the woman from The Angel's Rest.  Within another two days Barbara Golding was at
the bedside of Captain Louis Bachelor, battling with an enemy that is so often stronger than
love and always kinder than shame.

In his wanderings the sick man was ever with his youth and early manhood, and again and again
he uttered Barbara's name in caressing or entreaty; though it was the Barbara of far-off days
that he invoked; the present one he did not know.  But the night in which the crisis, the fortunate
crisis, of the fever occurred, he talked of a great flood coming from the North, and in his
half-delirium bade them send to headquarters, and mournfully muttered of drowned plantations
and human peril.  Was this instinct and knowledge working through the disordered fancies of
fever? Or was it mere coincidence that the next day a great storm and flood did sweep through
the valley of the Popri, putting life in danger and submerging plantations?

It was on this day that Roadmaster found himself at bay in the mangrove swamp not far from
the port of Rahway, where he had expected to find a schooner to take him to the New Hebrides.
It had been arranged for by a well-paid colleague in crime; but the storm had delayed the schooner,
and the avenging squatters and bushmen were closing in on him at last.  There was flood behind
him in the valley, a foodless swamp on the left of him, open shore and jungle on the right,
the swollen sea before him; and the only avenue of escape closed by Blood Finchley's friends.
He had been eluding his pursuers for days with little food and worse than no sleep. He knew
that he had played his last card and lost; but he had one thing yet to do, that which even
the vilest do, if they can, before they pay the final penalty--to creep back for a moment into
their honest past, however dim and far away.  With incredible skill he had passed under the
very rifles of his hunters, and now stood almost within the stream of light which came from
the window of the sick man's room, where his sister was.  There was to be no more hiding, no
more strategy.  He told Gongi and another that he was Roadmaster, and bade them say to his
pursuers, should they appear, that he would come to them upon the shore when his visit to Louis
Bachelor, whom he had known in other days, was over, indicating the place at some distance
from the house where they would find him.

He entered the house.  The noise of the opening door brought his sister to the room.

At last she said: "Oh, Edward, you are free at last!"

"Yes, I am free at last," he quietly replied.

"I have always prayed for you, Edward, and for this."

"I know that, Barbara; but prayer cannot do anything, can it?  You see, though I was born a

Debney sighed and shook his head.  "He was, by nature, the ablest man I ever knew.  Everything
in the world interested him."

"There lay the trouble, perhaps."

"Nowhere else.  All his will was with the wholesome thing, but his brain, his imagination were
always hunting.  He was the true adventurer at the start.  That was it, Mostyn."

"He found the forbidden thing more interesting than--the other?"

"Quite so.  Unless a thing was really interesting, stood out, as it were, he had no use for
it--nor for man nor woman."

"Lady Folingsby, for instance."

"Do you know, Mostyn, that even to-day, whenever she meets me, I can see one question in her
eyes: 'Where is he?'  Always, always that.  He found life and people so interesting that he
couldn't help but be interesting himself.  Whatever he was, I never knew a woman speak ill
of him. . . . Once a year there comes to me a letter from an artist girl in Paris, written
in language that gets into my eyes.  There is always the one refrain: 'He will return some
day.  Say to him that I do not forget.'"

"Whatever his faults, he was too big to be anything but kind to a woman, was Ted."

"I remember the day when his resignation was so promptly accepted by the Admiralty.  He walked
up to the Admiral--Farquhar it was, on the Bolingbroke--and said: 'Admiral, if I'd been in
your place I'd have done the same.  I ought to resign, and I have.  Yet if I had to do it over
again, I'd be the same.  I don't repent.  I'm out of the Navy now, and it doesn't make any
difference what I say, so I'll have my preachment out. If I were Admiral Farquhar, and you
were Edward Debney, ex-commander, I'd say: "Debney, you're a damned good fellow and a damned
bad officer."'

"The Admiral liked Edward, in spite of all, better than any man in the Squadron, for Ted's
brains were worth those of any half-dozen officers he had.  He simply choked, and then, before
the whole ship, dropped both hands on his shoulders, and said: 'Debney, you're a damned good
fellow and a damned bad officer, and I wish to God you were a damned bad fellow and a damned
good officer--for then there were no need to part.' At that they parted.  But as Edward was
leaving, the Admiral came forward again, and said: 'Where are you going, Debney?'  'I'm going
nowhere, sir,' Ted answered.  'I'm being tossed into strange waters--a lone corvette of no
squadron.'  He stopped, smiled, and then said--it was so like him, for, with all his wildness,
he had the tastes of a student: 'You remember that passage in Isaiah, sir, "And God shall turn
upon them violently, and toss them like a ball into a large country"?'

"There wasn't a man but had a kind thought for him as he left, and there was rain in the eyes
of more than one A.B.  Well, from that day he disappeared, and no one has seen him since. The

com-magnetical bones; passionately endeavouring living.



Debney shrugged a shoulder.  "Try Nob Hill, Fifth Avenue, and the Champs Elysees.  What does
a poor man-o'-war's-man know of such things?"

An hour later they were aboard the Cormorant dining with a number of men asked to come and
say good-bye to Mostyn, who was starting for England the second day following, after a pleasant
cruise with Debney.

Meanwhile, from far beyond that yellow lane of light running out from Golden Gate, there came
a vessel, sailing straight for harbour.  She was an old-fashioned cruiser, carrying guns, and
when she passed another vessel she hoisted the British flag.  She looked like a half-obsolete
corvette, spruced up, made modern by every possible device, and all her appointments were shapely
and in order.  She was clearly a British man- of-war, as shown in her trim-dressed sailors,
her good handful of marines; but her second and third lieutenants seemed little like Englishmen.
There was gun-drill and cutlass-drill every day, and, what was also singular, there was boat-drill
twice a day, so that the crew of this man-of-war, as they saw Golden Gate ahead of them, were
perhaps more expert at boat-drill than any that sailed.  They could lower and raise a boat
with a wonderful expertness in a bad sea, and they rowed with clock- like precision and machine-like
force.

Their general discipline did credit to the British Navy.  But they were not given to understand
that by their Commander, Captain Shewell, who had an eye like a spot of steel and a tongue
like aloes or honey as the mood was on him.  It was clear that he took his position seriously,
for he was as rigid and exact in etiquette as an admiral of the old school, and his eye was
as keen for his officers as for his men; and that might have seemed strange too, if one had
seen him two years before commanding a schooner with a roving commission in the South Seas.
Then he was more genial of eye and less professional of face.  Here he could never be mistaken
for anything else than the commander of a man-of-war--it was in his legs, in the shoulder he
set to the wind, in the tone of his orders, in his austere urbanity to his officers.  Yet there
was something else in his eye, in his face, which all this professionalism could not hide,
even when he was most professional--some elusive, subterranean force or purpose.

This was most noticeable when he was shut away from the others in his cabin.  Then his whole
body seemed to change.  The eye became softer, and yet full of a sort of genial devilry, the
body had a careless alertness and elasticity, the whole man had the athletic grace of a wild
animal, and his face had a hearty sort of humour, which the slightly-lifting lip, in its insolent
disdain, could not greatly modify.  He certainly seemed well pleased with himself, and more
than once, as he sat alone, he laughed outright, and once he said aloud, as his fingers ran
up and down a schedule--not a man-o'-war's schedule--laughing softly:

"Poor old Farquhar, if he could see me now!"  Then, to himself: "Well, as I told him, I was
violently tossed like a ball into the large country; and I've had a lot of adventure and sport.
But here's something more the biggest game ever played between nations by a private person--with
fifty thousand pounds as the end thereof, if all goes well with my lone corvette."

  He turned white,
and put out his hand to the bulwark to steady himself.  But Captain Shewell held the hand that
had been put out; shook it, pressed it.  He tried to urge Captain Debney forward, but the other
drew back to the gangway.

"Pull yourself together, Dick, or there'll be a mess," said Shewell softly.

"My God, how could you do it?" replied his brother aghast.

Meanwhile the anchor had been raised, and the Hornet was moving towards the harbour mouth.
"You have ruined us both," said Richard Debney. "Neither, Dick!  I'll save your bacon."  He
made a sign, the gangway was closed, he gave the word for full steam ahead, and the Hornet
began to race through the water before Captain Debney guessed his purpose.

"What do you mean to do?" he asked sternly, as he saw his own gig falling astern.

Captain Shewell spoke no word, but saluted deliberately, and watched his brother's boat recede,
till it was a speck upon the sea, as it moved towards Golden Gate.

"Good old Dick!" he said at last, as he turned away toward the bridge. "And he'll do it, if
he can!"
