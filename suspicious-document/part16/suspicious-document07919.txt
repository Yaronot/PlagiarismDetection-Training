[Footnote 34124: The insurrection at Lyons took place on May 29. On the 2nd of June it is announced
in the Convention that the insurgent army of Lozère, more than 30,000 strong, has taken Marvejols,
and is about to take Mende (Buchez et Roux XXVII. 387).--A threatening address from Bordeaux
(May 14) and from thirty-two sections in Marseilles (May 25) against the Jacobins (Buchez et
Roux, XXVII. 3. 214).--Cf. Robinet in "Le procès des Dantonistes, 303, 305.]

[Footnote 34127: Barrère, "Mémoires," II. 91, 94. As untruthful as Barrère is, here his testimony
may be accepted. I see no reason why he should state what is not true; he was well informed,
as he belonged to the Committee of Public Safety. His statements, besides, on the complicity
d the Mountain and on the rôle of Danton are confirmed by the whole mass of facts.--Buchez
et Roux, XXVIII. 200 (speech by Danton in the Convention, June 13). "Without the canon of the
31st of May, without the insurrection the conspirators would have triumphed; they would have
given us the law. Let the crime of that insurrection be on our heads! That insurrection--I
myself demanded it!... I demand a declaration by the Convention, that without the insurrection
of May 31, liberty would be no more!"--Ibid., 220. Speech by Leclerc at the Cordeliers club,
June 27: "Was it not Legendre who rendered abortive our wise measures, so often taken, to exterminate
our enemies? He and Danton it was, who, through their culpable resistance, reduced us to the
moderation of the 31st of May, Legendre and Danton are the men who opposed the revolutionary
steps which we had taken on those great days to crush out all the aristocrats in Paris!"]

[Footnote 34133: Meillan, 44. Placed opposite the president, within ten paces of him, with
my eyes constantly fixed on him, because in the horrible din which disgraced the Assembly we
could have no other compass to steer by, I can testify that I neither saw nor heard the decree
put to vote."--Buchez et Roux, XXVII. 278. Speech by Osselin, session of May 28: "I presented
the decree as drawn up to the secretaries for their signatures this morning. One of them, after
reading it, observed to me that the last article had not been decreed, but that the preceding
articles had been."--Mortimer-Ternaux, VII. 562. Letter of the deputy Michel. May 29. "The
guards were forced, and the sanctuary of the law invested from about four to ten hours, so
that nobody could leave the hall even for the most urgent purposes.]

[Footnote 34134: Mortimer-Ternaux, VII. 308. Extract from the official reports of the patriotic
club of Butte-des-Moulins, May 30. "Considering that the majority of the section, known for
incivism and its antirevolutionary spirit, would decline this election or would elect commissaries
not enjoying the confidence of patriots,".. the patriotic club takes upon itself the duty of
electing the two commissaries demanded.]
