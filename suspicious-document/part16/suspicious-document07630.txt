The summer home of Francis Parkman, LL.D., on Prince Street, deserves more than passing notice,
no only because of his great prominence as an historian and writer an scientific horticulture,
but for the remarkable beauty of the grounds lying along the chores of the lake and covered
with luxuriant and rare shrubs, trees, and plants, many of them models of symmetry and loveliness.
One cannot but regret that this homestead had not been preserved in its completeness, as a

About the year 1827, Mr. Stephen M. Weld, son of Captain William G. Weld, established a boarding-school
for young men on the site of the present residence of his family, the corner of South and Centre
streets, which was very successful during thirty years, pupils coming from many of the States
and from Mexico, Cuba, and Yucatan. Weld Hall, connected with Harvard College, was erected
by William F. Weld, in memory of his brother Stephen Minot Weld. Dr. Christopher Weld, another
son of Captain Weld, was the first homoeopathic physician here, and was much esteemed and beloved
during his long practice.

Upon the site of the present Seaverns mansion, on Morton Street, near Washington Street, stood
the old house of the gifted and scholarly Margaret Fuller between the years 1839 and 1842.
Her father had died a short time before, and her mother, sister (the late Mrs. Walter Channing),
and two brothers made with her the household. In this quiet, rural home, Margaret found time

The old Hallet, Seaverns, Balch, and Louder homes, all suggest interesting and valuable memories,
