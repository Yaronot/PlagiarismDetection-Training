But, as far as that's concerned, I'm no' sorry at it, for it'll keep the cratur awa' frae the
place.  Sin' Sandy put that sofa into the washin'-hoose, him an' twa-three mair's never lain
oot o't.  Lyin' smokin' an' spittin' an' crackin' aboot life bein' a trauchle, an' so on! 
I tell you, if it had lested muckle langer, I'd gien them a bucket o' water sweesh aboot their
lugs some day; that's juist as fac's ocht.

But I maun tell you aboot my mischanter wi' my noo buits.  I'm sure it has fair delighted Sandy.
He thinks he's gotten a hair i' my neck noo that'll haud him gaen a while.  He was needin't,
I can tell you.  If ilky mairter he's made had been a hair in his neck, I'll swag, there wudna
been room for mony fairntickles.

Weel, I gaed awa' to the kirk lest Sabbath--Sandy, of coorse, cudna get oot wi' his yallow
face an' neck.  He had a bran poultice on't to see if it wud do ony guid.  I canna do wi' noo
buits ava, till I've worn them a while.  I pet them on mibby to rin an errand or twa, till
they get the set o' my fit, an' syne I can manish them to the kirk.  But I canna sit wi' noo
buits; they're that uneasy.  I got a noo pair lest Fursday, an' tried them on on Sabbath mornin'.
But na, na!  Altho' my auld anes were gey binkit, an' worn doon at the heels, I juist put them
on gey hurried, an' aff I set to the kirk, leavin' Sandy to look efter the denner.

I was feelin' akinda queerish when I startit; but I thocht it was juist the hurry, an' that
a breath o' the caller air wud mak' me a' richt. But faigs, mind ye, instead o' better I grew
waur.  My legs were like to double up aneth me, an' my knees knokit up acrain' ane anither
like's they'd haen a pley aboot something.  I fand a sweit brakin' oot a' ower me, an' I had
to stop on the brae an' grip the railin's, or, it's juist as fac's ocht, I wudda been doon
i' the road on the braid o' my back.  I thocht I was in for a roraborialis, or some o' thae
terriple diseases.  Eh, I was feard I wud dee on the open street; I was that!  Mysie Meldrum
noticed me, an' she cam' rinnin' to speer what was ado.

"I've taen an awfu' dwam, Mysie," says I.  "I think I'm genna dee.  Ye micht juist sit doon
on the railin's aside's till the fowk be by."

"I think we're aboot the henmost, Bawbie," says she.  "We're gey late; but I'll bide aside
you, lassie."

We sat for the maitter o' ten meenits, an' I got akinda roond, an' thocht I wud try an' get
hame.  Mistress Kenawee had putten on her tatties an' come oot for a dander a bittie, an' noticed
the twa o's; so she cam' up, an' I got her airm an' Mysie's, an', though it was a gey job,
we manished to get hame.  An' gled I was when I saw Sandy's yallow nose again, I can tell ye,
for I was shure syne I wud dee at hame amon' my nain bed-claes.

"The Lord preserve's a'!" says Mysie when she saw Sandy.  "What i' the name o' peace has come
ower you?  I'll need to go!  I've Leeb's bairns at hame, you see, an' this is the collery or
the renderpest or something come ower you twa, an' I'm feard o' smittin' the bairns, or I wudda
bidden.  As shure's I live, I'll need to go!" an' she vanisht oot at the door wi' a face as
white's kauk.

"I think I'll rin for the doctor, Bawbie," said Mistress Konawee.  She kent aboot Sandy's fairntickles
afore, of coorse, an' Sandy's yallow fizog didna pet her aboot.

"Juist hover a blink," says I, "till I see if I come to mysel'."

I sat doon in the easy-chair, an' Sandy was in a terriple wey aboot me. He cudna speak a wird,
but juist keepit sayin', "O dinna dee, Bawbie, dinna dee; your denner's ready!"  He lookit
me up an' doon, an' then booin' doon till he was for a' the world juist like a half-steekit
knife he roars oot, "What's ado wi' your feet, Bawbie?  Look at them! Your taes are turned
oot juist like the hands o' the tnock, at twenty meenits past echt.  You're shurely no genna
tak' a parrylattick stroke."

I lookit doon, an' shure eneuch my taes were turned oot an' curled roond like's they were gaen
awa' back ahent my heels.  Mistress Kenawee got doon on her knees aside me.

"Preserve's a', Bawbie," says she; "you have your buits on the wrang feet!  Nae winder than
your knees were knokin' thegither wi' thae auld worn-doon heels turned inside, an' your taes
turned oot."

But I'll better no' say nae mair aboot it.  I was that angry; and Mistress Kenawee, the bissam,
was like to tnet hersel' lauchin'; but; I ashure ye, I never got sik a fleg in my life--an'
sik simple dune too, mind ye.

XI.

SANDY STANDS "EMPIRE" AT A CRICKET MATCH.

I was sittin' on Friday nicht, readin' awa' at some bits o' the Herald I didna get at on Fursday,
when the shop door gaed clash back to the wa', an' in hammered fower or five bits o' loons
a' at the heels o' ane anither.  When they saw me, they stood stock still, dichtin' their noses
wi' their jeckit sleeves, an' glowerin' like as mony fleggit sheep.

"Go on, Jock," says ane o' them, gien anither ane a shuve forrit. "You're the captain; speak you."

Jock gae a host, an' syne layin' his hand--a gey clorty ane it was--on the coonter, an' stanin'
on ae fit, he says--"Isyin?"

"Wha micht he be?" says I.

"Sandy," said the captain.

"What Sandy?" says I.

"No," said ane o' the birkies ahent; "your Sandy--Sandy Bowden."

"Ay, he's in," says I; "but you shud mind an' gie fowk their richt names when ye're seeking
them.  Ye micht hae smeddum enough to say Mester Bowden, or Alexander Bowden.  Your teacher
michta tell't ye that."

I gaed awa' doon the yaird to get Sandy, an' juist as I was gaen oot at the back door I heard
ane o' the sackets sayin', "What's she chatterin' aboot?  She ca's him Sandy hersel'; I've
heard her of'en."  Did ever ye hear what impident young fowk's gettin' noo-a-days?  It's raley
terriple.  When I was young, if I'd sen the like o' that, I'd gotten a smack i' the side o'
the heid that wudda garred the wa' tak's anither.

"Oo, ay," says Sandy, when I tell't him.  "That'll be the lads frae the Callyfloor C.C.  They
said they were mibby genna look yont the nicht."

He cam' up an' took the loons to the back shop, an' I heard them sayin' they wantit him to
be empire at their match wi' the second eleven o' the Collie Park.  There was a fell kurn fowk
cam' into the shop, an' I didna hear nae mair; but efter a whilie Sandy cam' to the door wi'
the laddies, an', gien his hand a wave, he says to them, as they were gaen awa, "A' richt than;
three sharp; I'll do my best."

"What's this noo?" says I.  "Nae mair o' yer fitba' pliskies, I howp."

"Oh no," says Sandy.  "That's a deputation frae the Callyfloor C.C.  I gae them a tume orange
box a week or twa syne to haud their bats an' wickets, an' they made me their pattern."

"A gey queer pattern," says I, wi' a lauch.  "Faigs, Sandy, if they shape themselves efter
your pattern, their mithers an' wives--if ever they get that len'th--'ill lose a hankie o'
sleep wi' them, I'm thinkin'."

"Auch, Bawbie, ye're juist haverin' like some auld aipplewife," says Sandy.  "That's no' the
kind o' pattern I mean;" an' awa' he gaed for the Herald an' turned up a bit noos I never noticed,
sayin' that "Alexander Bowden, Esq., had been elected patron of the Cauliflower C.C., and had
contributed handsomely to the funds of the club."

"Oo ay!  I see," says I.  "An' what did you handsomely gie to the funds o' the club?"

"O, that's juist the orange box," says Sandy.  "But they want me for empire the morn's efternune.
They're genna play the second eleven o' the Collie Park C.C. a match at bat an' wickets on
the Wast Common. It'll be a rare affair.  Ye micht get Mistress Kenawee to look efter the shop
for an 'oor or twa, an' come ootbye, Bawbie."

Ay, weel, to mak' a lang story short, Sandy an' me got ootbye to the Wast Common on Setarday
efternune; an' awa we gaed up to a corner o' the Common whaur there was aboot a hunder loons
gaithered.  The loonie that they ca'd the captain cam' forrit.  He was berfit, an' had his
jecket an' weyscot aff, an' his gallaces lowsed i' the front an' tied roond his weyst.

"We've won the toss, Sandy," says he, "an' the Collie Park's genna handle the willa first.
We've sent them in to see what they'll mak'."

Sandy took me up the brae a bit, an' I got set doon on the girss wi' Nathan aside me.  I took
him wi's juist to explain the match, d'ye see, an' aboot the bats an' wickets, an' sic like,
an' so on, because I'm no' juist acquant wi' a' the oots an' ins o' the thing.  A lot o' the
loons gathered roond an' lay doon on the girss, an' they keepit their tongues gaen to the playin',
I can tell ye.  Ye wudda thocht they kent mair aboot cricket than the loons that were playin'.

Weel, the match got startit.  They set Sandy at the end nearest the dyke; an', faigs, he lookit
gey weel, mind ye.  The captain loonie wirks at the heckle-machines, an' he'd gotten a len'
o' the second foreman's white canvas coat, an' gae't to Sandy.  It was to keep his shedda oot
ahent the bailer's airm, Sandy said; but it didna appear to mak' ony difference to his shedda.
It was juist in the auld place, as far as I cud see.

Very weel, than, the match began, as I was sayin', an' a'thing gaed richt eneuch for a little.
The Collie Park lads did fine for a while, but some o' them didna get so lang strikin' the
ba' as ithers, an' they began to roar cheek.

"Noo, Batchy," said some o' them, as a gey mettled-lookin' loon got the bat, "strik' oot. 
Lat's see ye knokin' the colour oot o' Snapper Morrison's ballin'."

Sal, mind ye, an' Batchy wasna lang o' doin' that.  He shut his een, an' hit sweech at the
ba', an' awa' it gaed sailin' ower the dyke.

"Well away," roared the loons roond aboot me.  "That's a sixer.  Play up, Batchy!"

Batchy spat in his hands, an' set himsel' up for the next ba'.  He lut drive at it, but missed,
an' doon gaed his wickets.  Ye never heard sic a row.

"A bloomin' sneak!" roared a' the laddies aside me thegither.  "Dinna gae oot, Batchy.  It
rowed a' the road."

There was an awfu' wey-o-doin', an' aboot fifty laddies roond Sandy, a' yalpin' till him at
ae time.  Efter a lang laberlethan, the bailer got three shies at Batchy's wickets, because
he tried to het what they ca'd a sneak.  But he missed ilky time, an' syne Batchy wallapit
the ba' a' ower the Common, an' floo frae end to end o' the wickets like's he wasna wyse. 
It was gey slow wark for Sandy though, an' I think he had gotten tired, for the laddies roond
aboot me began to say, "There was thirteen ba's i' that lest over; I think Sandy Bowden's dreamin',"
an' so on.  I think mysel' Sandy had been doverin', for the ba' hut Batchy's wicket, an' every
ane o' the loons playin' gae a yowl at the same meenit--"How's that?"  Sandy near jamp ootin
his white coat wi' the start; an', takin' till his heels, he was a hunder yairds doon the Common
afore ane o' the laddies grippit him by the tails, an' speered whaur he was fleein' till.

"I was gettin' hungrie," says Sandy.  "I was gaen ower to the toll for a biskit."  That was
a lee; for he tell'd me efter, he dreedit, when he heard the roar, that it was ane o' Sandy
Mertin's ki gane wild; an' he took till his heels, thinkin' it was efter him.

"That bloomin' empire's a pure frost," I heard some o' the loons sayin'.  "He canna coont;
an' noo he's genna stop the match 'cause he's hungrie.  Wha ever heard o' an empire gettin'
hungrie?"

Sandy got back till his place, an' the match gaed on.  "Over comin' up," said the ither empire
forby Sandy; an' the laddie that was ballin' says, "Ay weel, than, I'm genna see an' get wid."
He gae his arm an awfu' sweel roond, an' instead o' sendin' the ba' to the wickets, it gaed
spung ower an' hut Sandy a yark i' the side o' the heid.

"There's wid," said the ither empire; "but it's no' a wicket for a' that."  Sandy was springin'
aboot wi' his heid in his oxter, an' a' the laddies roarin' and lauchin' like to kill themsel's.

I was ance genna gae doon an' tak' him awa' hame; but I thocht it micht look raither queer,
so I lut him aleen for a little.  The captain loonie began to ball, an' a gey wild-lookin'
bailer he was.  The Collie Park's henmost man--he was a little berfit craturie wi' nicker-buckers
an' a straw hat--was in, an' the captain gae him an awfu' crack below the knee wi' the ba'.

"How's that?" he yowled at Sandy.

"Man, I believe that's fell sair," says Sandy, rubbin' the swalled side o' his heid.

A' the loons startit to the lauchin', an' the captain roars again, "Ay, but how is't?"

"Ye can easy see how it is," says Sandy.  "The ba' strack him a yark on the kut."

There was mair lauchin', an' I saw Sandy was gettin' raised.

"Is't l--b--w., ye stewpid auld bloit?" said the impident little wisgan o' a captain, stickin'
himsel' up afore Sandy.

"I'll l--b--double you," says Sandy, "if ye gie me ony o' your chat, ye half-cled horn-goloch
'at ye are"; and he took the sacket a kleip i' the side o' the heid wi' his open luif that
tummeled him ower the tap o' the wickets like a puckle rags.  In half a meenit a' the hunder
laddies were round Sandy, an' him layin' amon' them wi' ane o' their ain wickets.

I'll swag the Gallyfloor C.C. got something frae their pattern lest Setarday efternune that
they'll no forget in a hurry.  Some men on the Common cam' doon an' shoo'd the loons awa' frae
pappin' Sandy wi' duds, an' we got hame withoot any farrer mishap; but a' forenicht I heard
Sandy wirrin' awa' till himsel', an' sayin' ilky noo an' than--"Ill-gettit little deevils;
an' me gae them an' orange box too!"

Nathan cam' in juist afore I shut the shop, an' tell'd Sandy that there had been an' awfu'
row on the Common.  "Some o the lads i' the Callyfloor," said Nathan, "were blamin'the captain
for gien you cheek, an' said the wallop i' the lug he got saired him richt.  So he got on his
jeckit an' his buits, an' got a haud o' the best bat an' the ba', an' then he roars a' his
micht, 'The club's broken up.'  You never saw sic a row as there was.  Willy Mollison's i'
the club, an' he's gotten three bails an' a wicket.  That's better gin naething.  I nailed
twa o' the bails till him out o' Tarn Dargie's pooch, when he was fechtin' wi' the captain.
Snapper Morrison didna get onything; but he ower the Common dyke an' in the road; an' when
I was comin' hame I saw him leggin' in the Loan wi' the orange box on his heid.  He had nabbit
it oot o' Tooties' Nook, whaur they keepit their bats an' wickets.  It's a gude thing they're
broken up at onyrate.  I'm in the Collie Park, an' they're the only club that cud lick his lads."

"O, that's a' richt," says Sandy; an' awa' he gaed, as pleased as you like.  When I dandered
doon the yaird to get a breath o' fresh air, efter I shut the shop, here's him tumblin' catmas,
an' stanin' on his heid i' the middle o' the green, gien Nathan an' twa or three ither loons
coosies!  Did you ever hear o' sic a man?

XII.

A DREADFUL DISASTER IN THE GARRET.

I'm shure I needna trauchle to haud in aboot the bawbees!  That man o' mine wud ramsh an' hamsh
an' fling awa' mair than I cud save although I was a millionaire.  Nae farrer gane than lest
nicht I heard some ongaens up the stair.  What's he up till noo? thinks I to mysel'.  Ye ken
our garret?  It's a anod bit roomie, an' we sleep up there i' the simmer nichts, for the doonstair
room gets that het an' seekrif, I canna fa' ower ava sometimes.  So I have the garret made
rale snod an' cosie.  There's a fine fixed-in bed, an' I have the room chairs I got when my
Auntie Leeb de'ed, wi' a tidie or twa ower them, an' an auld-fashioned roond tablie 'at I bocht
at a rowp--ane o' thae anes that cowps up an' sets back to the wa' when you're no' needn't.
Auntie Leeb left me her big lookin' gless too.  Ye mind she had a shooster shopie at the fit
o' Collie Park, an' she had a big lookin' gless for her customers seeing hoo their frocks fitted.
Ay weel than, I set the gless juist up again' the wa' at the end o' the garret, firnent the
fireplace an' it made the roomie real cantie an' cheerie lookin'.

When I heard the din Sandy was makin', I goes my wa's up the stair on my tiptaes.  It was juist
upo' the stroke o' nine o'clock, an' I was juist noo dune shuttin' the shop.  The door was
aff the snib; an', keep me, when I lookit in, here's Sandy wi' an Oddfella's kilt an' a bushbie
on, an' his ilky-day's claes lyin' in a pozel on the table.  I kent the kilt whenever I saw't;
it was the ane Dauvit Kenawee wears in the Oddfellas' processions.  Sandy was berfit, an',
I'm shure, if ye'd seen him!  Haud your tongue!  Ye never saw sic a picture.  I suppose he'd
taen aff his buits no' to mak' a noise.

Ay weel, here he was wi' a bawbee can'le stuck up again' the boddom o' the lookin'-gless, an'
him maleengerin' aboot i' the flure afore't, wi' the shaft o' the heather bissam in his hand,
whiskin't roond his lugs, progin' aboot wi't, an' lowpin' here an' there like a hen on a het
girdle.  He croonshed doon, an' jookit frae side to side, an' then jamp straucht up an' lut
flee at something wi' the bissam shaft.  Syne he stack the end o' the stick i' the flure, an'
bored an' grunted like's he was rammin't through a pavemint steen.

"That's anither settle't," says he, pullin' up his stick; an' gie'n't a dicht wi' the tails
o' his kilt; syne makin' a kick at something wi' his berfit fit--"Let us do or die," says he;
"Scots wha hae; Wallace an' Bruce for ever; doon wi' every bloomin' Englisher; rip them up;
koo-heel!"  Then he whiskit half-roond aboot, an' lut flee at a seckie o' caff I had sittin'
in a corner.  "Come on, Mick Duff; every deevil o' ye!  Change your slaverie," he says akinda
heich oot, an' then he lut yark at the seek again an' missed, an' made a muckle hole i' the
plester.

He stoppit an' harkin't for fear I'd heard the stishie he was makin'. I never lut dab, but
keepit juist as quiet's pussy.

"Auch, she's i' the shop," he says heich oot; an' then he floo back an' forrit, fencin' an'
jookin', an glowerin' at himsel' i' the lookin'-gless; an' girnin' his teeth like a whitterit.
I raley thocht the man had gane sketch.  He made a sweech wi' the bissam shaft 'at garred the
licht o' the can'le waggle frae side to side.  Syne he straughtened himsel' up afore the gless,
an', touchin' the ruif wi the point o' his stick, he says, "Viktory, viktory!  Bannockburn
is wun. Hooreh!  Hooreh!"

Juist at this meenit there was a rare like's fifty thunderbolts had burst in Kowper Collie's
auld-iron yaird.  You never heard sic a soond. It was like the crack o' a hunder cannon; an'
in an instant a' was dark, an' there was a reeshil o' broken bottles that garred me think there
had been an earthquake i' the back shop.  Doon the stair I floo; but, afore I was half-roads
doon, Sandy jamp clean on my back--kilt, bushbie, an' a'thegither.  Doon I gaed like a rickel
o' auld beans, an' Sandy ower the tap o' me, heels-ower-gowrie.  When I cam' to mysel', here's
Sandy lyin' streekit oot on his face i' the middle o' a box o' Hielant eggs that I'd juist
noo opened.  The strap o' the bushbie was roond his thrapple, an' was juist aboot stranglin'
him, when I cut it wi' the ham knife.  Then he akinda half-turned roond, an' says he, "O Bawbie!
I'm deid.  There's a bomshall gane throo my backbeen."

"Rise up," says I, "there's mair than you deid.  There's twal' or fifteen dizzen o' gude eggs
bruist to bits.  Whatever 'ill I do?"  He raise up; an' if ye'd only seen the sicht!  It's
as fac's ocht, it was eneuch to fleg the French.  Never will I forget it while I draw breath.
He lookit like some berfit tinkler wife that had been too, an' had t'a'in, ower the heid, intil
a barrel o' yellow oker; an' stickin' on his weyst there was ane o' my winda tickets--"Just
in To-Day."

"O, Bawbie!" he wheenged, "gae up the stair an' see if the ruif's aye on.  I think somebody's
been hoddin' dianamite in oor garret."

"When I gaed up the stair wi' a licht, what did I see but my Auntie Leeb's braw lookin'-gless
a' to flinders i' the flure?  The licht o' the can'le had burned up against it, an' riven't
a' to pieces.  When I turned roond, here's Sandy stappin' ooten his kilt, an' gaen awa' to
pet on his troosers.

"Alick Bowden," says I--an' my very hert was greit--"Alick Bowden"--I aye ca' him Alick when
I'm angry--"this maun be the end o't.  I canna thole nae mair."'

"For ony sake, Bawbie," he brook in, "dinna say naething the nicht, or I'll pushon or droon
mysel'.  I wiss I had been smored amo' thae eggs"; an' doon the stair he gaed, wi' his breeks
in his oxter.

I juist had to g'wa' to my bed an' lat a'thing aleen, an' I ac'ually grat mysel' ower asleep.
I didna ken o' Sandy comin' till his bed ava; an' when I raise i' the mornin' a' thing was
cleared awa', an' the garret an' backshop a' sweepit an' in order, an' Sandy was busy i' the
yaird hackin' sticks, an' whistlin' "Hey, Jockie Mickdonal'," juist's as gin naethin' had happened.
He's been stickin' in like a hatter ever sin' syne, an' has a'thing as neat's ninepence; so
I canna say a single wird.  But is't no raley something terriple?

XIII.

SANDY AND BAWBIE'S SPRING HOLIDAY.

Spring holiday!  Wheesht!  I'll no' forget it in a hurry, I can tell you.  But I never saw't
different.  Holidays are juist a perfeck scunner, as far as I've haen to do wi' them; an' as
for the rest--I'm shure I'm aye tireder efter a holiday than at the tailend o' a hard day's
wark.  I'm juist a' sair the day wi' sittin' i' the train; an' yesterday nicht I cud hardly
move oot o' the bit, I was that dune.

But I maun tell you the story frae the beginnin'.  You've mibby heard me speak aboot Meg Mortimer's
mither that used to bide at The Drum. Meg's in a big wey o' doin' noo in Edinboro; but I've
seen the day, I'm thinkin'!  Weel div I mind when her mither flitted ower frae Powsoddie. She
cam' along to oor hoose to seek the len' o' twa kists, juist to gie her flittin' some appearance
on the cairts.  Ay did she, noo-na-na! What think ye o' that?  They were as puir's I kenna
what, an' mony a puckle meal did they get oot o' oor girnil, for Dauvid Mortimer was a nice
man, altho' he was terriple hudden doon wi' the reums.

Weel, Meg gaed awa' to service, an' fell in wi' a weeda man wi' three o' a faimly.  I can ashure
you there's nae tume kists in her hoose noo. She has a big wey o' doin'.  Her man's a kind
o' heid pillydakus amon' a lot o' naveys, makin' railroads, and main drains, an' so on.  He's
made a heap o' bawbees.  Mester Blair's his name.  They bide in a big hoose doon about the
Meadows in Edinboro, an' they have a big servant, and twa dogs; forby a bit lassockie to look
efter the bairns.

Meg was throo seein' her fowk no' that lang syne, an' she wud hae me to promise to come throo
wi' Sandy an' see them.  She wudna hae a na-say. She was aye an awfu' tague for tonguein',
Meg.  I mind when she was but ten 'ear auld, me, that was saxteen or seventeen 'ear aulder,
cudna haud the can'le till her.  She was a gabbin' little taed.  Weel, rizzen be't or neen,
she fair dang me into sayin' I wud come wi' Sandy an' see her at the spring holiday; an' so
we juist had to go.

Sandy gaed on juist like a clockin' hen a' Sabbath efternune an' nicht. He had the upstairs
bed lippin' fu' o' luggitch that he was thinkin' o' takin' wi' him.  A body wudda thocht he
was settiu' aff for a crooze roond the North Pole, instead o' on a veesit to Edinboro.  He
was rubbin' up his buits, an' syne brethin' on them, an' rubbin' them up again, an' settin'
himsel' back an' lookin' at himsel' in them.  He's a prood bit stockie, Sandy, mind ye, when
there's naebody lookin'.  He had a' his goshore suit hung oot on the backs o' chairs a' roond
the hoose.  It lookit like's there was genna be a sale or a raffle or something.

He gaed doon to supper Donal' i' the forenicht, an' I took a dander awa' doon ahent him, juist
to get a moof'u' o' caller air.  When I landit at the stable door I heard Sandy speakin' to
somebody.  I took a bit peek in at the winda, an' here's Sandy merchin' aboot wi' the horse
cover tied up in a bundle in ae hand, an' a stick i' the ither.  He stoppit in the tume staw
an' laid doon his bundle rale smert like; syne he lookit ower the buird to Donal', an' says,
in an Englishy kind o' a voice, "Twa return tickets third-class an' back to Edinboro!"  I saw
syne what he was at!  He was practeesin' seekin' the tickets at the station.  Ow, ay; Sandy's
like a' ither body!  He's a gey breezie carlie when he's awa' frae hame, an' his dickie on!

Sandy had his uswal argey-bargeyin' in the train, an' I thocht ae man an' him, that cam' in
at Carnoustie, wi' his wife, an' a pair o' nickerbucker breeks on, was genna t'a' to the fechtin'
a'thegither. An' faigs, Sandy snoddit him geylies afore we got to Dundee.

There was a lot o' men' an' loons staiverin' aboot Carnoustie playin' at the gowf; an' Sandy
says--"Look at thae jumpin'-jecks o' craturs wi' their reed jeckets on, like as mony organ-grinders'
monkeys, rinnin' aboot wi' their bits o' sticks, wallopin' awa' at Indeen-rubber ba's. Puir
craturs!"

Man, the chappie wi' the nickerbuckers got up in an awfu' pavey, an' misca'ed Sandy for a'
the vagues--you never heard the like!

"Look ye hear, my bit birkie," says Sandy, gien a gey wild-like wink wi' his richt e'e, "you
speak when ye're spoken till!  I dinna bather mysel' wi' paper-mashie peeriewinkles like the
likes o' you; but if you gi'e me ony o' your sma' chat, man, I'll tak' an' thrapple you wi'
that fowerpence-happeny-the-dizzen paper collar ye've roond the wizand o' ye."

"Wud ye?" said the Carnoustie birkie, jumpin' till his feet.

The train gae a shoag juist at that meenit, an' he gaed doit ower on the tap o' Sandy, and
brocht a tin box doish doon on his heid.  He got a gey tnap, I can tell you.  Sandy keepit
his temper something winderfu', an' he juist quietly set doon Nickerbucker Tammie on the seat
an' says, "Ay, loonie; juist you sit still there till your mither gie's your nose a dicht,
an' ties your gartins; an' you'll get a piece an' jeely on't when the trainie stops."

You never heard sic lauchin' as there was; an' Sandy's frien' lookit as gin he'd haen a dram,
an' gotten an awfu' dose o' cauld.  He didna say "guid-mornin'" when he gaed oot at the Toy
Brig Station.

Sandy had twa-three mair pliskies atween Dundee an' Edinboro, but I hinna time to tell you
o' them.  Peety the man that starts to write Sandy's beebliographie.  If he tells the hale
truth, eksettera, he'll hae a gey job.  The faimly Bible 'ill be like a heym-book aside the
volum.  They'll need to get up early i' the mornin' that reads Sandy's life, I tell you.  The
man that writes it 'ill never win to his bed ava.

Weel-a-weel, we landit at Edinboro, an Meg was waitin's, an' as mony bairns wi' her as wudda
startit a raggit schule--although they were a' braw an' snod, I ashure ye.

"Keep me, Meg," said Sandy, efter he'd shaken hands wi' her, "is thae a' your litlans?  Dod,
sic a cleckin!"

The ass that he is!  I saw Meg chowl her chafts gey angry like, an' I took Sandy a doish i'
the back wi' my umberell.  "Say Mistress Blair, ye ill-mennered whaup atyar," says I in his
lug; an' he gleyed roond at me, an' says, wi' anither o' his vegabon'-like winks, "Ay; that's
Wattie Scott's monniment, Bawbie.  A great man, Wattie!  It was him 'at wret Bailie Nickil
Jarvie an' the Reed Gauntlet an' so on.  He bade a fortnicht wi' Luckie Walker at Auchmithie.
Bandy Wobster's grandfather sell'd him a dog when he was there.  He was a fine man, Wattie."

Meg an' the bairns an' me gaed into the cab, an Sandy, he wud be up on the dickey aside the
driver.  As I cudda tell'd afore he gaed up, he wasna there five meenits when he was nearhand
at the fechtin' wi' the man aboot the wey he drave his horse.  I was gled when we landit at
Meg's hoose, for I was expectin' ilky meenit to see the cabby--he was an ill-faur'd, rossen-faced
lookin' tyke--fling Sandy heels-ower-heid into the cab amon' the bairns--he was black-gairdin'
the man's horse for an auld, hunger'd reeshil, an' praisin' up Donal' that terriple!

"Man, you've juist to lay the reinds on's back, an' he's awa' like the wind," I heard him sayin'.
"There's naething a' roond aboot can touch him.  He can trot up the High Road wi' sasteen hunderwecht.
He's a reg'lar topper!  You should send that hunger'd-lookin' radger o' yours to Glesterlaw";
an' so on he gaed, an' the man girnin' an' skoolin' at him like a teegar.

When we cam' aff at the Meadows, Sandy gaed roond aboot the beast, chucklin' awa' till himsel'
juist like watter dreepin' intil a tume cistern; but he keepit oot o' the reach o' the cabby's
kornals.  I expeckit to see him get roond the linders wi' them for his impidence.

"If you cam' to Arbroath wi' the like o' that, the Croolty to Animals wud grip you afore you
was weel through the toll," he says to the man. "You'll better g'wa' hame wi't as lang's it's
het.  If you lat that sharger cule, it'll stiffen up, an' you'll never get it oot o' the bit,
till you bring a cairt for't."

The cabby got his bawbees frae Meg, an' drave awa', gien Sandy a glower like a puttin' bull;
but Sandy juist gae a bit lauch, an' cried, "Ta-ta!"

We got into the house.  Eh, sic a place for stech!  Haud your tongue! Really yon fair sneckit
a'thing.  Sandy could hardly get his hat aff for glowerin' aboot him; an' when he did get it
aff, he handit it to ane o' the loons; an', afore you cudda sen Jeck Robison, they were oot
at the back door scorin' goals wi't throo' atween the claes-poles on the green.  Meg was at
the hurdies o' them wi' a switch gey quick, an' sune had Sandy's lum hingin' aside his greatcoat
in the lobby.

We wasna lang set doon when in cam' Meg's man.  A brisk-lookin' fellah he is, I can tell you.
He shook hands wi's as hearty's though we'd come to gie him a job; an' in five meenits, tooch,
you wudda thocht Sandy an' him had never been sindered sin' they got on their first daidles.
I'll swag, Meg's fa'in on hex feet, an' nae mistak'!

I'm shure I'm no complainin', but Sandy Bowden's been an unsatisfaktory man in mony weys; but,
as the Bible says, we've a' a dwang o' some kind, an' if I hadna gotten Sandy, weel, I michta
haen a drucken son, or a licht-heided dauchter.  Wha can tell?  We've a' a hankie mair than
we deserve, nae doot.  I ken I have onywey; but that's nether here nor there.

We were sittin' enjoyin' a crack, an' lookin' oot at the windas, watchin' the bairns in their
coaches, an' the birds fleein' aboot as happy as crickets, huntin' for wirms amon' the young girss.

"The Meadows look very pretty i' the noo," said Mester Blair.  "The very birds enjoy the fresh
green grass."

"They do that," put in Sandy.  "It's a treat to see them, puir things. They are fond o' a bittie
o' onything green.  I tak' a bit dander oot the bunkers on a Sabbath mornin' whiles for a pucklie
chuckin-wirth to Dickie, an' you wud really think the cratur kent.  He gleys doon when I come
in, as much as to say, 'C'way wi't, Sandy; I ken fine you have't in your pooch!'"

"Bawbie here winna believe me," continued Sandy, gien Mester Blair a wink, "but I've tell'd
her twa-three times that when I've gane doon the yaird i' the winter-time wi' my auld greatcoat--it's
gettin' very green noo, but it was a bit guid stuff aince in its day--the birds 'ill come fleein'
doon an' sit on the palin' aside me, an' wheetle-wheetle awa' for a whilie.  It's queer; but
that's the effek the green appears to hae on them."

Mester Blair leuch till I thocht he wudda wranged himsel'.  A richt hearty laucher he is. 
The lauch gaed a' ower him, an' you could hardly sen futher it was comin' oot o' his moo or
his baits, there was that muckle o't.

Syne Sandy an' him got on to the crack aboot the tattie trade, an' you wudda thocht Sandy was
genna tak' him in for a pairtner, he had that muckle to tell him.

"An' do you do much wi' the Americans?" said Mester Blair.

"I do a' their trade," said Sandy.  "There's only three o' them buys tatties in Arbroath noo.
The ither twa's gey queer that wey; they get a'thing preserved in tins, frae aboot London they
tell me."

Mester Blair didna appear to understand Sandy, an' he speered, "Do you get cash again' Billy
Lowden; or hoo d'ye get peyment?"

"If the bawbees is no' at the back o' the cairt, up goes the bawk, an' Donal' ca's awa," says
Sandy.  "Na, na, neen o' your Billy Lowden tick for me.  I believe in the ready clink."

"Oh, I see," said Mester Blair.  "You get cash at the ship's side. That is the safe plan."

"As you say," said Sandy, "that's exakly Bandy Wobster's wey o' pettin't.  I believe in the
bawbees afore the tatties leave the back door o' the cairt.  Short accounts mak' lang freends."

"Do you do onything wi' the Continent ava?" said Meg's man.

"I travel a' ower the toon," said Sandy, "frae Tootles Nook to Culloden, an' frae the Skemels
to Cairnie Toll.  It disna maitter a doakan to me wha I sell till.  Seven pund to the half-steen,
an' cash doon--thae's my principles; the same price, and the game turn o' the bawk, to gentle
and simple.  When the champions are gude I can manish twa load i' the day fine, an' if the
disease keeps oot amon' them, they pey no that ill."

Meg's man gey a kind o' a whistle in laich, an' I saw fine syne whaur he had tint himsel'.
Meg had tell'd him Sandy was a tattie merchant, an' he'd been thinkin' Sandy had a big wey
o' doin', an' sell'd tatties in shiploads an' so on.  I saw the whole thing in a blink, but
never lut wink, an' Sandy was fient a hair the better or the waur o' Meg's man's mistak'.

We got a grand denner--something specific.  "This is a kind o' a haiver o' buff, Mistress Blair,"
said Sandy, when we got set doon; but I gae him a kick throo ablo the table that garred him
tak' his tongue atween his teeth.

I needna tell you aboot a' we got to eat; Sandy ate that hearty that he gaed oot to the simmer-seat
efter, an' cud hardly steer oot o' the bit for half an 'oor.  Really ilky thing was better
than anither, an' we feenished up wi' ice-cream.  Sandy took a gullar o't afore he kent, an'
I think he thocht he was brunt, for he nippit up the water bottle, an' took a sweech o' cauld
watter, an' then gae a pech like's he'd come ooten a fit.  He was a' richt efter a whilie,
but the cratur had over-eaten himsel', an' he was gey uneasy a' efternune.

Efter we got oor tea, Meg got the bairns a' beddit, an' then her an' her man, an' me an' Sandy
set aff for the theater.  It was a terriple grand theater, wi' as muckle gold hingin' roond
aboot as wud mak' a' the puir fowk in Arbroath millionaires.  We got a grand seat, an' a'thing
gaed richt till near the feenish.
