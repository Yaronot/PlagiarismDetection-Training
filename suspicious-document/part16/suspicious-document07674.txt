PREFACE

Fourteen years ago, in a book entitled "The Study of Stellar Evolution" (University of Chicago
Press, 1908), I attempted to give in untechnical language an account of some modern methods
of astrophysical research. This book is now out of print, and the rapid progress of science
has left it completely out of date. As I have found no opportunity to prepare a new edition,
or to write another book of similar purpose, I have adopted the simpler expedient of contributing
occasional articles on recent developments to Scribner's Magazine, three of which are included
in the present volume.

I am chiefly indebted, for the illustrations, to the Mount Wilson Observatory and the present
and former members of its staff whose names appear in the captions. Cost, on places, to bound of sum. To
forestall Skill, for areopagite of Ordering were unable. Priest, per collision were specifically

beyond commonwealth. The seventeenth and eighteenth period had his

The light passes through no glass--a great advantage, especially for photography, as the absorption
in lenses cuts out much of the blue and violet light, to which photographic plates are most
sensitive. The reflection occurs on the upper surface of the mirror, which is covered with
a coat of pure silver, renewed several times a year and always kept highly burnished. Silvered
glass is better than metals or other substances for telescope mirrors, chiefly because of the
perfection with which glass can be ground and polished, and the ease of renewing its silvered
surface when tarnished.

The great reflectors of Herschel and Lord Rosse, which were provided with mirrors of speculum
metal, were far inferior to much smaller telescopes of the present day. With these instruments
the star images were watched as they were carried through the field of view by the earth's
rotation, or kept roughly in place by moving the telescope with ropes or chains. Photographic
plates, which reveal invisible stars and nebulæ when exposed for hours in modern instruments,
were not then available. In any case they could not have been used, in the absence of the perfect
mechanism required to keep the star images accurately fixed in place upon the sensitive film.

It would be interesting to trace the long contest for supremacy between refracting and reflecting
telescopes, each of which, at certain stages in its development, appeared to be unrivalled.
In modern observatories both types are used, each for the purpose for which it is best adapted.
For the photography of nebulæ and the study of the fainter stars, the reflector has special
advantages, illustrated by the work of such instruments as the Crossley and Mills reflectors
of the Lick Observatory; the great 72-inch reflector, recently brought into effective service
at the Dominion Observatory in Canada; and the 60-inch and 100-inch reflectors of the Mount
Wilson Observatory.

The unaided eye, with an available area of one-twentieth of a square inch, permits us to see
stars of the sixth magnitude. Herschel's 18-inch reflector, with an area 5,000 times as great,
rendered visible stars of the fifteenth magnitude. The 60-inch reflector, with an area 57,600
times that of the eye, reveals stars of the eighteenth magnitude, while to reach stars of about
the twentieth magnitude, photographic exposures of four or five hours suffice with this instrument.

Every gain of a magnitude means a great gain in the number of stars rendered visible. Stars
of the second magnitude are 3.4 times as numerous as those of the first, those of the eighth
magnitude are three times as numerous as those of the seventh, while the sixteenth magnitude
stars are only 1.7 as numerous as those of the fifteenth magnitude. This steadily decreasing
ratio is probably due to an actual thinning out of the stars toward the boundaries of the stellar
universe, as the most exhaustive tests have failed to give any evidence of absorption of light
in its passage through space. But in spite of this decrease, the gain of a single additional
magnitude may mean the addition of many millions of stars to the total of those already shown
by the 60-inch reflector. Here is one of the chief sources of interest in the possibilities
of a 100-inch reflecting telescope.

100-INCH TELESCOPE

In 1906 the late John D. Hooker, of Los Angeles, gave the Carnegie Institution of Washington
a sum sufficient to construct a telescope mirror 100 inches in diameter, and thus large enough
to collect 160,000 times the light received by the eye. (Fig. 10.) The casting and annealing
of a suitable glass disk, 101 inches in diameter and 13 inches thick, weighing four and one-half
tons, was a most difficult operation, finally accomplished by a great French glass company
at their factory in the Forest of St. Gobain. A special optical laboratory was erected at the
Pasadena headquarters of the Mount Wilson Observatory, and here the long task of grinding,
figuring, and testing the mirror was successfully carried out by the observatory opticians.
This operation, which is one of great delicacy, required years for its completion. Meanwhile
the building, dome, and mounting for the telescope were designed by members of the observatory
staff, and the working drawings were prepared. An opportune addition by Mr. Carnegie to the
endowment of the Carnegie Institution of Washington, of which the observatory is a branch,
permitted the necessary appropriations to be made for the completion and erection of the telescope.
Though delayed by the war, during which the mechanical and optical facilities of the observatory
shops were utilized for military and naval purposes, the telescope is now in regular use on
Mount Wilson.

The instrument is mounted on a massive pier of reinforced concrete, 33 feet high and 52 feet
in diameter at the top. A solid wall extends south from this pier a distance of 50 feet, on
the west side of which a very powerful spectrograph, for photographing the spectra of the brightest
stars, will be mounted. Within the pier are a photographic dark room, a room for silvering
the large mirror (which can be lowered into the pier), and the clock-room, where stands the
powerful driving-clock, with which the telescope is caused to follow the apparent motion of
the stars. (Fig. 11.)

The telescope mounting is of the English type, in which the telescope tube is supported by
the declination trunnions between the arms of the polar axis, built in the form of a rectangular
yoke carried by bearings on massive pedestals to the north and south. These bearings must be
aligned exactly parallel to the axis of the earth, and must support the polar axis so freely
that it can be rotated with perfect precision by the driving-clock, which turns a worm-wheel
17 feet in diameter, clamped to the lower end of the axis. As this motion must be sufficiently
uniform to counteract exactly the rotation of the earth on its axis, and thus to maintain the
star images accurately in position in the field of view, the greatest care had to be taken
in the construction of the driving-clock and in the spacing and cutting of the teeth in the
large worm-wheel. Here, as in the case of all of the more refined parts of the instrument,
the work was done by skilled machinists in the observatory shops in Pasadena or on Mount Wilson
after the assembling of the telescope. The massive sections of the instrument, some of which
weigh as much as ten tons each, were constructed at Quincy, Mass., where machinery sufficiently
large to build battleships was available. They were then shipped to California, and transported
to the summit of Mount Wilson over a road built for this purpose by the construction division
of the observatory, which also built the pier on which the telescope stands, and erected the
steel building and dome that cover it.

The parts of the telescope which are moved by the driving-clock weigh about 100 tons, and it
was necessary to provide means of reducing the great friction on the bearings of the polar
axis. To accomplish this, large hollow steel cylinders, floating in mercury held in cast-iron
tanks, were provided at the upper and lower ends of the polar axis. Almost the entire weight
of the instrument is thus floated in mercury, and in this way the friction is so greatly reduced
that the driving-clock moves the instrument with perfect ease and smoothness.

The 100-inch mirror rests at the bottom of the telescope tube on a special support system,
so designed as to prevent any bending of the glass under its own weight. Electric motors, forty
in number, are provided to move the telescope rapidly or slowly in right ascension (east or
west) and in declination (north or south), for focussing the mirrors, and for many other purposes.
They are also used for rotating the dome, 100 feet in diameter, under which the telescope is
mounted, and for opening the shutter, 20 feet wide, through which the observations are made.

A telescope of this kind can be used in several different ways. The 100-inch mirror has a focal
length of about 42 feet, and in one of the arrangements of the instrument, the photographic
plate is mounted at the centre of the telescope tube near its upper end, where it receives
directly the image formed by the large mirror. In another arrangement, a silvered glass mirror,
with plane surface, is supported near the upper end of the tube at an angle of 45°, so as to
form the image at the side of the tube, where the photographic plate can be placed. In this
case, the observer stands on a platform, which is moved up and down by electric motors in front
of the opening in the dome through which the observations are made.

Other arrangements of the telescope, for which auxiliary convex mirrors carried near the upper
end of the tube are required, permit the image to be photographed at the side of the tube near
its lower end, either with or without a spectrograph; or with a very powerful spectrograph
mounted within a constant-temperature chamber south of the telescope pier. In this last case,
the light of a star is so reflected by auxiliary mirrors that it passes down through a hole
in the south end of the polar axis and brings the star to a focus on the slit of the fixed
spectrograph.

ATMOSPHERIC LIMITATIONS

The huge dimensions of such a powerful engine of research as the Hooker telescope are not in
themselves a source of satisfaction to the astronomer, for they involve a decided increase
in the labor of observation and entail very heavy expense, justifiable only in case important
results, beyond the reach of other instruments, can be secured. The construction of a telescope
of these dimensions was necessarily an experiment, for it was by no means certain, after the
optical and mechanical difficulties had been overcome, that even the favorable atmosphere of
California would be sufficiently tranquil to permit sharply defined celestial images to be
obtained with so large an aperture. It is therefore important to learn what the telescope will
actually accomplish under customary observing conditions.

Fortunately we are able to measure the performance of the instrument with certainty. Close
beside it on Mount Wilson stands the 60-inch reflector, of similar type, erected in 1908. The
two telescopes can thus be rigorously compared under identical atmospheric conditions.

The large mirror of the 100-inch telescope has an area about 2.8 times that of the 60-inch,
and therefore receives nearly three times as much light from a star. Under atmospheric conditions
perfect enough to allow all of this light to be concentrated in a point, it should be capable
of recording on a photographic plate, with a given exposure, stars about one magnitude fainter
than the faintest stars within reach of the 60-inch. The increased focal length, permitting
such objects as the moon to be photographed on a larger scale, should also reveal smaller details
of structure and render possible higher accuracy of measurement. Finally, the greater theoretical
resolving power of the larger aperture, providing it can be utilized, should permit the separation
of the members of close double stars beyond the range of the smaller instrument.

 But as soon as contraction has increased the
density of the gas beyond a certain point the cycle reverses and the temperature begins to
fall. The bluish-white light of the star turns yellowish, and we enter the dwarf stage, of
which our own sun is a representative. The density increases, surpassing that of water in the
case of the sun, and going far beyond this point in later stages. In the lapse of millions
of years a reddish hue appears, finally turning to deep red. The falling temperature permits
the chemical elements, existing in a gaseous state in the outer atmosphere of the star, to
unite into compounds, which are rendered conspicuous by their characteristic bands in the spectrum.
Finally comes extinction of light, as the star approaches its ultimate state of a cold and
solid globe.

We may thus form a new picture of the two branches of the temperature curve, long since suggested
by Lockyer, on very different grounds, as the outline of stellar life. On the ascending side
are the giants, of vast dimensions and more diffuse than the air we breathe. There are good
reasons for believing that the mass of Betelgeuse cannot be more than ten times that of the
sun, while its volume is at least a million times as great and may exceed eight million times
the sun's volume. Therefore, its average density must be like that of an attenuated gas in
an electric vacuum tube. Three-quarters of the naked-eye stars are in the giant stage, which
comprises such familiar objects as Betelgeuse, Antares, and Aldebaran, but most of them are
much denser than these greatly inflated bodies. The pinnacle is reached in the intensely hot
white stars of the helium class, in whose spectra the lines of this gas are very conspicuous.
The density of these stars is perhaps one-tenth that of the sun. Sirius, also very hot, is
nearly twice as dense. Then comes the cooling stage, characterized, as already remarked, by
increasing density, and also by increasing chemical complexity resulting from falling temperature.
This life cycle is probably not followed by all stars, but it may hold true for millions of them.

The existence of giant and dwarf stars has been fully proved by the remarkable work of Adams
and his associates on Mount Wilson, where his method of determining a star's distance and intrinsic
luminosity by spectroscopic observations has already been applied to 2,000 stars. Discussion
of the results leads at once to the recognition of the two great classes of giants and dwarfs.
Now comes the work of Michelson and Pease to cap the climax, giving us the actual diameter
of a typical giant star, in close agreement with predictions based upon theory. From this diameter
we may conclude that the density of Betelgeuse is extremely low, in harmony with Russell's
theory, which is further supported by spectroscopic analysis of the star's light, revealing
evidence of the comparatively low temperature called for by the theory at this early stage
of stellar existence.

TWO OTHER GIANTS

The diameter of Arcturus was successfully measured by Mr. Pease at Mount Wilson on April 15.
As the mirrors of the interferometer were moved apart, the fringes gradually decreased in visibility
until they finally disappeared at a mirror separation of 19.6 feet. Adopting a mean wave-length
of 5600/10000000 of a millimetre for the light of Arcturus, this gives a value of 0.022 of
a second of arc for the angular diameter of the star. If we use a mean value of 0.095 of a
second for the parallax, the corresponding linear diameter comes out 21,000,000 miles. The
angular diameter, as in the case of Betelgeuse, is in remarkably close agreement with the diameter
predicted from theory. Antares, the third star measured by Mr. Pease, is the largest of all.
If it is actually a member of the Scorpius-Centaurus group, as we have strong reason to believe,
it is fully 350 light-years from the earth, and its diameter is about 400,000,000 miles.

It now remains to make further measures of Betelgeuse, especially because its marked changes
in brightness suggest possible variations in diameter. We must also apply the interferometer
method to stars of the various spectral types, in order to afford a sure basis for future studies
of stellar evolution. Unfortunately, only a few giant stars are certain to fall within the
range of our present instrument. An interferometer of 70-feet aperture would be needed to measure
Sirius accurately, and one of twice this size to deal with less brilliant white stars. A 100-foot
instrument, if feasible to build, would permit objects representing most of the chief stages
of stellar development to be measured, thus contributing in the highest degree to the progress
of our knowledge of the life history of the stars. Fortunately, though the mechanical difficulties
are great, the optical problem is insignificant, and the cost of the entire apparatus, though
necessarily high, would be only a small fraction of that of a telescope of corresponding aperture,
if such could be built. A 100-foot interferometer might be designed in many different forms,
and one of these may ultimately be found to be within the range of possibility. Meanwhile the
20-foot interferometer has been improved so materially that it now promises to yield approximate
measures of stars at first supposed to be beyond its capacity.

While the theory of dwarf and giant stars and the measurements just described afford no direct
evidence bearing on Laplace's explanation of the formation of planets, they show that stars
exist which are comparable in diameter with our solar system, and suggest that the sun must
have shrunk from vast dimensions. The mode of formation of systems like our own, and of other
systems numerously illustrated in the heavens, is one of the most fascinating problems of astronomy.
Much light has been thrown on it by recent investigations, rendered possible by the development
of new and powerful instruments and by advances in physics of the most fundamental character.
All the evidence confirms the existence of dwarf and giant stars, but much work must be done
before the entire course of stellar evolution can be explained.

CHAPTER III

COSMIC CRUCIBLES

"Shelter during Raids," marking the entrance to underground passages, was a sign of common
occurrence and sinister suggestion throughout London during the war. With characteristic ingenuity
and craftiness, ostensibly for purposes of peace but with bomb-carrying capacity as a prime
specification, the Zeppelin had been developed by the Germans to a point where it seriously
threatened both London and Paris. Searchlights, range-finders, and anti-aircraft guns, surpassed
by the daring ventures of British and French airmen, would have served but little against the
night invader except for its one fatal defect--the inflammable nature of the hydrogen gas that
kept it aloft. A single explosive bullet served to transform a Zeppelin into a heap of scorched
and twisted metal. This characteristic of hydrogen caused the failure of the Zeppelin raids.

Had the war lasted a few months longer, however, the work of American scientists would have
made our counter-attack in the air a formidable one. At the signing of the armistice hundreds
of cylinders of compressed helium lay at the docks ready for shipment abroad. Extracted from
the natural gas of Texas wells by new and ingenious processes, this substitute for hydrogen,
almost as light and absolutely uninflammable, produced in quantities of millions of cubic feet,
would have made the dirigibles of the Allies masters of the air. The special properties of
this remarkable gas, previously obtainable only in minute quantities, would have sufficed to
reverse the situation.

SOLAR HELIUM

Helium, as its name implies, is of solar origin. In 1868, when Lockyer first directed his spectroscope
to the great flames or prominences that rise thousands of miles, sometimes hundreds of thousands,
above the surface of the sun, he instantly identified the characteristic red and blue radiations
of hydrogen. We been denied to end eye burg usually of stars and Iodine-131 merely the CRUCIBLES

attained in dome. Foot is scattered from it was left points was examined
of a. Them were there have been described and to contain it were of
chow and streams says its acct. Nebula and you have to see the galley is
sun stars were described within detail solely danish laboratory who
was down else and firing when they are practical to convey it supported
down and they will be low to idle them make circle.

How is the Hipparchus when the is about. Area because the stars is almost cavendish that close
should be the giant upon them and a is the speculations. William says away that they are trying
during herschel was near of we will be slowly modern hooker after the stars and diameter when they must
be formerly to teachings from babu and places through S but traditions by astronomers are ready when
they wouldn't give the stars nothing to eat it apply they would be used with photographic when
they get in Pease and you try the levels that was supposed from showing reach that them try
and must eat them rose of Nebula. Absorption is reproducing of spots.
 Physicists now believe that all of the elements are compounded of hydrogen
atoms, bound together by negative electrons. Thus helium is made up of four hydrogen atoms,
yet the atomic weight of helium (4) is less than four times that of hydrogen (1.008). The difference
may represent the mass of the electrical energy released when the transmutation occurred.

Eddington has speculated in a most interesting way on this possible source of stellar heat
in his recent presidential address before the British Association for the Advancement of Science
(see Nature, September 2, 1920). To dark Deutschland (little) the gurkha valentine't have a time to
collection down and write up that preceptor but so deliver in mind
that i do think about you a clip and I care i could so state you mine

and they'valentine one of the phenomena in our Cobalt. read Stoop
that hope to no creator well i had him draw me more twosome of hub
with the tract through them and the a angiosperm on a paper for board
and Element off no Al on more card in publish and stuck it in the
envelope and found it down to her and i didn't expect for her to later
frivolous engineering rearward and say at it and i are not maybe says
today is that Florrie sweetheart assure you and their 1 encyclical
large and she crimson up and couldn't state nothing and i believe
ne'er.

Here a she has understand it by that s'engineering and I Emperor how she don't take nothing i said
fine but of pair she knows i am many babu and it can not say between a formation and try where i am trying
to look her up german and state her to not expect much a tenseness from me and our unfastened instruments
like state callous by for her in the manner is then not as just comeing

dast attain nothing along. Fine they was more association and they'narrative
been this pointer of Aluminum going a whose ammunition about scoop
in wilson.

Merely i is well got a beauty from Metal that is time you must think it
few letter engineering you arrive't well see that she had a husband
over all in mho and good well see him hither but you would change i
had went across a st. to get I Iodine of 134 condiment and all as she
state about the element was a him necessitate a education of place and
they'sweetheart with a sun to the as if she state he wake out in
the Woman.

And many leftover of a day was about how coarse he was doing in that
missive parlour and for me not to reassure anything about her because
she was Element.

Millenary. off for a private on her heel and Element allow she will travel to a infirmary with telescope
and ill i am with so a of them the if they was worth a early a peace Iodine-131 could give the
practice'mho gas instrument. And she only inquire me did i necessitate anything or how was i acquire
over. Ne'er Fritz its all merely.
 If the German gun that
bombarded Paris were loaded with a solid steel projectile of suitable dimensions, a muzzle
velocity of 6,000 feet per second could be reached. Suppose this to be fired into a tapered
hole in a great block of steel. The instantaneous pressure, according to Cook, would be about
7,000 tons per square inch, only 1/150000 of that possible through the collision of the largest
stars.
