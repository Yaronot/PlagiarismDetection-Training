A haze of uncertainty shrouds his original advent among the Huguenots. It lifts for a moment
to show him there; and that is all. As soon as he has ridden within the Huguenot lines the
clouds gather once more, and darkness swallows up his individuality. He tells one anecdote
in the History of the manner in which the Huguenots chased Catholics in the hills of Languedoc.
They tracked the fugitives to caverns half way up precipitous cliffs. Then they smoked them
out with their treasures by lighted bundles of straw let down by iron chains opposite the mouth.
General Pelissier plagiarised the device, with more murderous details, in Algeria in 1849.
It is a specimen of the brutalities of a conflict, which its English assistants, though they
had countenanced, would not care to chronicle minutely. To Ralegh's keen sight the struggle
would soon have displayed itself shorn of the glamour of religious enthusiasm. He regarded
it simply as a civil war, by which 'the condition of no nation,' as he wrote later, 'was ever
bettered.' Of one of its prime authors, Admiral Coligny, he has recorded his belief that he
'advised the Prince of Condé to side with the Huguenots, not only out of love to their persuasion,
but to gain a party.' English troopers on their return were not likely to dilate on their exploits
at the Court of Elizabeth, who audaciously disavowed to the French Catholic Court the auxiliaries
she had licensed.

[Sidenote: In the Netherlands.]

[Sidenote: The Middle Temple.]

On the authority of an observation of the younger Hakluyt's, that Ralegh had resided longer
in France than he, the period is computed to have been not less than six years. As he appears
to have been in London at the end of February, 1575, that term would be completed within a
fortnight, if he were present at the battle of Jarnac. The time covered the massacre of St.
Bartholomew's Day, August 24, 1572. But there is no foundation for the story that he was then
in Paris, and was one of the Englishmen sheltered in Walsingham's house. He had enlisted as
a lad of seventeen. He emerged a man of twenty-three. Of this long and critical stage in his
education we know really nothing, as we know nothing of his youth at school and college. After
he quitted France it would appear from allusions by several contemporary writers that he served,
about 1577-78, in the Netherlands with Sir John Norris's contingent under the Prince of Orange.
Modern enquirers have doubted the fact, on the ground of evidence that he was in England between
1576 and 1578. The reasoning is not demonstrative. He may, if a regular combatant, have obtained
a furlough to cross over, and see his family; or, from his English home, he may have paid a
flying visit or visits to his brother, Sir Humphrey Gilbert, who commanded a regiment of the
English auxiliaries. The dates are not incompatible even with a statement that he fought at
the battle of Rimenant on August 1, 1578, though, had he been present on so famous an occasion,
it would have been more like him to refer somewhere to the circumstance. But if there is no
sufficient ground for questioning the belief in his participation in the war of the Low Countries,
there is yet less for disputing his residence in England from 1576. He own though a secret and cease

 'I have spent,' he writes,
'some time here under the Deputy, in such poor place and charge as, were it not for I knew
him to be one of yours, I would disdain it as much as to keep sheep.' His tone implied that
he understood he had come on probation for more exalted functions elsewhere, and that he had
a claim upon Leicester's patronage. How he had established it is unknown. Probably the intimacy
began in London before he received his Irish commission. He was at any rate sufficiently intimate
to be able to recommend a man of some eminence, as was Sir Warham St. Leger, to the Earl's
protection.

[Sidenote: Return to England.]

He did not wish to stay in Ireland. The immediate success of his hardness and resoluteness,
when he was given a free hand, would have deprived him of the option, if he had wished it.
After Ormond's dismissal the pacification of Munster went rapidly on under him and his fellow
lieutenants. Captain John Zouch, an officer as ruthless to Irishmen as himself, who was appointed
Governor of the province in August, 1581, worked on the same lines. It became practicable to
disband part of the English forces. Ralegh's own company was paid off without apparent dissatisfaction
on his part. Being needed no longer in Ireland he was sent home by Grey in December, 1581,
with despatches. For his expenses he was paid on December 29, at the liberal rate of £20, which
may be roughly reckoned as equivalent to £100.

CHAPTER III.

ROYAL FAVOUR (1581-1582).

[Sidenote: Ralegh and Grey.]

This visit of Ralegh's to the Court was the turning-point in his career. How it became that
has been explained in different ways. According to Naunton a variance between him and Grey
drew both over to plead their cause. Naunton goes on to say that Ralegh 'had much the better
in telling of his tale; and so much that the Queen and the lords took no slight mark of the
man and his parts; for from thence he came to be known, and to have access to the Queen and
the lords.' It is natural to suppose that Ralegh's Irish campaigns were concerned with his
sudden rise at Court. Thenceforward he was a high authority on Irish policy. His Irish experience
continued to be the sheet-anchor of his ascendency with the Queen. Naunton's tale, too, is
supported by evidence from the Hatfield and the Irish State papers of Ralegh's disposition
to form and push Irish plans of his own, and of Grey's keen jealousy of the habit. Burleigh
on January 1, 1582, in a letter to the Lord Deputy, mentioned that Mr. Rawley had informed
her Majesty how the charge of five or six hundred soldiers for the garrison of Munster might
be shifted from the Queen to the province without umbrage to Ormond, its most powerful land-owner.
To this the Lord Deputy speedily replied, vehemently criticising 'the plot delivered by Captain
Rawley unto her Majesty.' He condemned it as a plausible fancy, 'affecting credit with profit,'
but 'framed upon impossibilities for others to execute.' To Walsingham he complained bitterly
of misrepresentations at Court in the same January, and, in the following April, declared that
he 'neither liked Captain Rawley's carriage, nor his company.' On the other hand, Grey is not
known to have returned from Ireland till August, 1582; and the Council Register contains no
reference to a personal controversy between Ralegh and him. But Ralegh may well have privately
expounded to the Queen and some Privy Councillors his views, which would then have been transmitted
to Grey to answer. Naunton's mistake in confronting the Deputy and the self-confident Captain
directly at the Council board does not seriously affect the value otherwise of his statement.
Still, the account of Ralegh's admittance to the Queen's favour, with its particular circumstances,
rests, it must be remembered, on Naunton's own not unimpeachable authority. Other authors who
tell the same story, have simply and unsuspiciously borrowed it from him. Students of Ralegh's
history have to accustom themselves to the use by successive biographers of the same hypothetical
facts with as much boldness as if they had been the fruit of each writer's independent research.

Naunton says that, 'though he gained much at the Court, he took it not out of the Exchequer,
or merely out of the Queen's purse, but by his wit and the help of the prerogative; for the
Queen was never profuse in delivering over her treasures, but paid most of her servants, part
in money, and the rest with grace.' He adds, it may be hoped, before October 29, 1618: 'Leaving
the arrears of recompense due for their merit to her great successor, who paid them all with
advantage.' Ralegh himself, after a similar compliment to James, laments in his History the
Queen's parsimony to her 'martial men, both by sea and land,' none of whom, he remembers, 'the
Lord Admiral excepted, her eldest and most prosperous commander,' did she 'either enrich, or
otherwise honour, for any service by them performed.' Notices in official documents of pecuniary
grants to himself are rare. An order in September, 1587, for a payment of £2000 to be spent
according to her Majesty's direction appears to have been for works at Portsmouth. No meagre
substitute was supplied by forfeitures, by enforced demises of collegiate, capitular, and episcopal
estates, by monopolies, and by letters of marque.

[Sidenote: Farm of Wines.]

[Sidenote: Broadcloths.]

To All Souls College, Oxford, belongs the honour of having been the first to help to make his
fortune. In April, 1583, he wrote to Egerton, then Solicitor-General, mentioning a grant of
two beneficial leases of lands which the Queen had extorted from the college after her manner.
On May 4, 1583, he received a more lucrative gift, the farm of wines. By his patent every vintner
was bound to pay him for his life an annual retail licence fee of a pound. To save himself
trouble, he underlet his rights to one Richard Browne for seven years at £700, or, according
to another account, £800, a year. Browne promoted a large increase in the number of licensed
taverners. Ralegh had reason to believe that he had not his fair share of profits. Egerton
advised him that the demise was disadvantageous, but that it might be hard to terminate it
without Browne's concurrence. Ralegh, to compel a surrender from Browne before the expiration
of the term, obtained a revocation of his own patent in 1588. On August 9, 1588, a new patent
for thirty-one years was granted. It does not seem to have freed him wholly from Browne's claims.
This licence again he leased. The lessee was William Sanderson, the husband of his niece, Margaret
Snedale. At a later period he had disputes with Sanderson also on the profits. By an account
of 1592, he estimated them at a couple of thousand a year. It was never a very popular office
to be chief publican. The year after the original grant, it involved Ralegh in a troublesome
quarrel. He or Browne had licensed a vintner, John Keymer, at Cambridge, in defiance of the
Vice-Chancellor's jurisdiction. The undergraduates loyally beat the intruder, and they frightened
his wife nearly to death. The Vice-Chancellor sent him to gaol. The University also invoked
the aid of its Chancellor, the Queen's Minister, against the Queen's favourite. Burleigh procured
an opinion of the two Chief Justices against the licence. Ralegh was obliged in the end to
give way to his assured loving friend the Vice-Chancellor. In the second patent the privileges
of Oxford and Cambridge were expressly saved. In other respects it was wider. It allowed Ralegh
a moiety of the penalties accruing to the Crown. The controversy with Cambridge may have been
due only to Browne, and his eagerness for fees. In general, Ralegh appears to have exercised
his powers moderately. A grantee who succeeded commended him for having 'ever had a special
care to carry a very tender hand upon the business for avoiding of noise and clamour, well
knowing it to be a thing extracted from the subject upon a nice point of a statute law.' A
year after the first patent of wines he received a similar boon. This was a licence in March,
1584, to export for a twelvemonth woollen broadcloths. A payment to the Crown was reserved.
In 1585, 1587, and 1589 the same privilege was conferred and enlarged. One grant authorized
him to export overlengths. Burleigh protested. He declared the conditions too beneficial to
the grantee. Probably they were. The privilege brought him into collision with several bodies
of merchants. Soon after the earliest of the licences had been granted, in June, 1584, we read
of a petition, backed by Walsingham, for the release of ships which had infringed his patent.
The Queen would not consent unless upon the terms that the offenders compounded with him. In
1586 the Merchant Adventurers of Exeter obtained a commission of inquiry whether his officers
did not levy excessive fees upon certificates. He is represented by a local antiquary as less
popular in that city than elsewhere in Devonshire. His patent rights as well as his official
duties caused ill-will between it and him.

[Sidenote: An Irish Seigniory.]

A gift in appearance much more magnificent, though the gains eventually were meagre, was the
Irish grant of 1586. At last the Earl of Desmond's insurrection had been quelled, at the cost
of the utter devastation of a province. The curse of God was, it was lamented, so great, and
the land so barren, that whosoever did travel from one end to the other of all Munster, even
from Waterford to Limerick, about six score miles, he should not meet man, woman, nor child,
save in cities or towns, nor yet see any beast, save foxes and wolves, or other ravening creatures.
The few survivors fed upon weeds and carrion, robbing the graves and gibbets of their dead.
It was determined to repeople the 574,268 forfeited acres. Ralegh retained his Irish captain's
commission. In 1587 his name occurs at the head of the list. He, Ormond, Hatton, and Fitton
were among the principal Undertakers for the resettlement. By the scheme nobody was to undertake
for more than twelve thousand acres. On each portion of that size eighty-six families were
to be planted. In Ralegh's favour, by express words and warrant in a special letter from her
Majesty, the Crown rent was fixed at a hundred marks, calculated subsequently as £60 13s. 4d.;
and the limitation of acreage was relaxed. Seigniories varied in extent from twelve to four
thousand acres. Possibly in order to avoid too gross an appearance of indulgence to him, Sir
John Stowell and Sir John Clyston, according to the Boyle-Lismore papers, were associated or
named with him as joint undertakers. A Privy Seal warrant in February, 1586, confirmed by letters
patent in the following October, awarded to the three three seigniories and a half in Waterford,
Cork, and perhaps Tipperary. A certificate of March, 1587, stated that, if the lands assigned
to them and their tenants should not be found to amount to 'three seigniories of twelve thousand
acres apiece, and one seigniory of six thousand acres, then other lands should be added.' The
patronage of the Wardenship of Our Lady's College of Youghal was added to Ralegh's share with
several other lucrative privileges. Three centuries afterwards the House of Lords decided that
an exclusive salmon fishery in the tidal waters of the Blackwater was among them. The domain
stretched along both banks of the river from Youghal harbour. The soil was rich; but the royal
commissioners for the survey reported it waste from neglect. Generally it was overgrown with
deep grass, and in most places with heath, brambles, and furze.

[Sidenote: English Forfeitures.]

In 1587 he added English estates to his Irish. The Babington conspiracy had been detected the
year before. By a grant which passed the Great Seal without fee in March, 1587, he acquired
much of the principal plotter's property. He obtained lands in Lincolnshire, Derbyshire, and
Notts, together with all goods and personalty, except a curious clock reserved to the Queen's
own use. According to modern taste, the pillage of confiscated estates is not an honourable
basis for a great man's prosperity. In the reign of Elizabeth it was still the orthodox foundation.
It was give and take, as Ralegh had to experience. That the unfortunate Babington had rested
some hope of life on Ralegh's known Court influence is but a coincidence. He wrote on the 19th
of September, 1586, the day before his execution, of 'Master Rawley having been moved for him,
and been promised a thousand pounds, if he could get his pardon.' There was a traffic in pardons
at Court. Odious and suspicious as was the practice, and liable to the grossest abuse, the

He was believed to have endowed his Sovereign with a new realm. He had the glory of having
enriched his country with new fruits, plants, and flowers. The nature of the man was that he
could touch nothing but immediately it appropriated itself to him. He is fabled to have been
the first to import mahogany into England from Guiana. He set orange trees in the garden of
his wife's uncle, Sir Francis Carew, at Beddington; and he has been credited with their first
introduction. The Spaniards first brought potatoes into Europe. Hariot and Lane first discovered
them in North Carolina. He grew them at Youghal, and they became his. Hariot discoursed learnedly
on the virtues of tobacco, and Drake conveyed the leaf to England. Ralegh smoked, and none
but he has the repute of the fashion. He gave the taste vogue, teaching the courtiers to smoke
their pipes with silver bowls, and supplying them with the leaf. Sir John Stanhope excuses
himself in 1601 from sending George Carew in Ireland any 'tabacca, because Mr. Secretary and
Sir Walter have stored you of late.' Till he mounted the scaffold, having first 'taken tobacco,'
the kingdom resounded with legends, doubtful enough, of his devotion to this his familiar genius.
It was told how his old manservant deluged him at Sherborne with spiced ale to put out the
combustion inside him; how he won wagers of the Queen that he could weigh vapours; how he smoked
as Essex died. Society stared to see him take a pipe at Sir Robert Poyntz's. His gilt leather
tobacco case was a prize for a Yorkshire museum. For words, ways, and doings, he was the observed
of all observers. He was active in twenty different directions at once. He was always before
the eyes of the world. His name was on every lip.

[Sidenote: Pioneer and Privateer.]

Among his constant motives of action was a fiery indignation at the spectacle of the Spanish
monopoly of the New World. No sentiment could stir more of English sympathy. The people heartily
shared his determination to rival Spain, and to pillage Spain. He had the Viking spirit, and
he burnt with a freebooter's passion for the sea. But he had an intuition also of the national
capacity for colonization, in which the purest patriot must have concurred. He was resolved
to direct the maritime enthusiasm of his countrymen and their age to that definite end. He
succeeded, though destined to the lot rather of Moses than of Joshua. His outlay on Virginia
did not bound his expenditure in these ways. Adrian his half-brother, and his habitual associate,
had resumed Sir Humphrey Gilbert's old project for the discovery of a North-West Passage to
India and China. A patent was granted him in 1583. He established a 'Fellowship' to work it.
Ralegh joined. Captain John Davys was appointed commander, and two barks were equipped. Davys
discovered Davis's Straits. Mount Ralegh, shining like gold, he christened after one of his
most celebrated patrons. Hakluyt in 1587 stated that Ralegh had thrice contributed with the
forwardest to Davys's North-West voyages. From a mixture of patriotism, maritime adventurousness,
and the love of gain, he employed his various opportunities to engage in privateering as a
regular business. Privy Council minutes for 1585 mention captures by him, through his officers,
of Spanish ships, with 600 Spaniards, at the Newfoundland fisheries. He sent forth in June,
1586, his ships Serpent and Mary Spark, under Captains Jacob Whiddon and John Evesham, to fight
the Spaniards at the Azores. In a battle of thirty-two hours, against twenty-four Spanish ships,
they failed to capture two great caracks which they coveted. They brought home three less valuable,
but remunerative, prizes. Don Pedro Sarmiento de Genaboa, Governor of the Straits of Magellan,
and other captives were worth heavy ransoms. Ralegh repeats in the History, 'a pretty jest'
told him 'merrily' by the worthy Don Pedro, on whom he clearly did not allow thraldom to weigh
heavily, how the draftsman of the chart of the Straits invented an island in them at his wife's
instance, that she might have something specially her own in the chart. In the same year, 1586,
he contributed a pinnace to a plundering expedition of the Earl of Cumberland's to the South
Sea. Though he was not allowed to be often at sea in person, he vindicated by his eager promotion
of maritime adventures a full right to be entered, as we find him in January, 1586, in an official
list of 'sea captains.'

[Sidenote: Charges of Piracy.]

[Sidenote: His Defence.]

As Vice-Admiral of the South-West, he possessed advantages beyond most for private raids upon
Spanish commerce. When he was not on the spot, his faithful and affectionate deputy in Devonshire,
Sir John Gilbert, was at hand to look after his ships' stores. Doubtless outrages were committed
under shelter of his Court favour. He joined the evil experiences of the sailor with those
of the soldier and courtier in his dying regrets. Occasionally the Privy Council had to expostulate
energetically. In 1589 a ship of his took two barks of Cherbourg. He and his officers were
charged to minister no cause of grief to any of the French king's subjects. In the same year,
Albert Reynerson was lodging complaints against Ralegh's captain of the Roebuck. Another of
his captains, John Floyer, in 1592, was accused of having captured a ship of Bayonne with a
load of cod, beside a waistcoat of carnation colour, curiously embroidered. Filippo Corsini
sued him in that year for a ship his people had seized. In 1600 the Republic of Venice was
aggrieved at the capture of a Venetian merchantman by Sir John Gilbert, junior, eldest son
of Sir Humphrey, in command of one of Ralegh's vessels. At other times Venice claimed the surrender
of Venetian goods in Spanish bottoms, though Ralegh stoutly argued against the claim. Sometimes
the Government could not but interfere when neutrals had been pillaged. It was always reluctant
to discourage the buccaneering trade, which it knew to be very lucrative. For instance, Ralegh
and eleven other adventurers in 1591 equipped, at a cost of £8000, privateers which brought
home prizes worth £31,150. The profit to the partnership was £14,952, which must be multiplied
five times to express the present value. In high places no repugnance to the pursuit was felt.
The Queen not rarely adventured, and looked for the lion's share of the spoil. Robert Cecil,
after he had succeeded to his father's ascendency, was willing to speculate, if his association
might be kept secret: 'For though, I thank God, I have no other meaning than becometh an honest
man in any of my actions, yet that which were another man's Pater noster, would be accounted
in me a charm.' Ralegh's views and character obliged him to no bashful dissimulation of the
practice. We say scheme if we understand it appear he felt, the is no sea. Rear, ferrol, he can

ESSEX. THE ARMADA (1587-1589).

[Sidenote: Popularity of Essex.]

As a favourite Ralegh was certain to have originally been hated by the people. His favour might
have been tolerated by courtiers, or by a sufficient section of them, if he had been content
to parade and enjoy his pomps, and had let them govern. His strenuous vigour exasperated them
as much as his evident conviction of a right to rule. They never ceased to regard him on that
account as a soldier of fortune, and an upstart. So poor a creature as Hatton had his party
at Court. When he retired to the country in dudgeon at a display of royal grace to Ralegh,
his friends, as Sir Thomas Heneage, were busy for him so late as April, 1585. Elizabeth was
persuaded by them to let them give him assurances on her behalf, that she would rather see
Ralegh hanged than equal him with Hatton, or allow the world to think she did. When Hatton
was out of date the courtiers combined to set up Essex against him, and had the assistance
of the multitude in their tactics. The popular attitude towards Essex is the solitary exception
to the rule of the national abhorrence of favourites. It is explained as much by the dislike
of Ralegh as by Essex's ingratiating characteristics. Animosity against Ralegh stimulated courtiers
and the populace to sing in chorus the praises of the stepson of the detested Leicester. No
anger was exhibited at the elevation of a lad of twenty to the Mastership of the Horse. Stories
of the Queen's supposed infatuation, how she 'kept him at cards, or one game or another, the
whole night, and he cometh not to his own lodgings till birds sing in the morning,' amused,
and did not incense. Meanwhile the approved soldier, the planter of Virginia, was in the same
May, 1587, truthfully described as 'the best hated man of the world in Court, city, and country.'

[Sidenote: His Antipathy to Ralegh.]

For the crowd Essex may have had the merit of being of an ancient nobility, which needed no
intricate demonstration by antiquaries and genealogists. He had enough patrimonial wealth to
justify the Sovereign in showering largess upon him. He was not one of the irrepressible west
countrymen who brought their nimble wits, comeliness, and courage to the market of the Court.
He was more bright than stately. His petulance did not produce an impression of haughtiness.
For the courtier class he possessed the yet higher virtue of willingness to be at once a centre
and watchword and an instrument. From the first he was manipulated as an engine against Ralegh.
In a letter to one of his many confidants he shows the readiness with which he accepted the
office. In 1587 Elizabeth was on a progress, and was staying at North Hall in Hertfordshire.
Ralegh, as Captain of the Guard, and Essex both attended her. Essex writes to his friend, Edward
Dyer, that he reproached the Queen for having slighted his sister, Lady Dorothy Perrot, the
wife of Ralegh's old antagonist, Sir Thomas. He declared to her 'the true cause of this disgrace
to me and to my sister, which was only to please that knave Ralegh, for whose sake I saw she
would both grieve me and my love, and disgrace me in the eyes of the world. For myself, I told
her I had no joy to be in any place, but was loth to be near about her, when I knew my affection
so much thrown down, and such a wretch as Ralegh highly esteemed of her.' When he called Ralegh
a wretch the Queen expressed her disgust at the impertinence by turning away to Lady Warwick,
and closed the interview.

[Sidenote: Ralegh's Decline.]

Essex spoke, and perhaps thought, thus of Ralegh in 1587. So the nation at large spoke and
thought of him then, and for many years afterwards. If he had only been such as he had as yet
shown himself, posterity might have found it difficult to prove the condemnation unjust. He
had risen in virtue of a handsome person and a courtly wit. He had equipped expeditions of
discovery, in which he took no share of the perils, and the whole of the glory. He had fought
and spoiled the Spaniards, chiefly by deputy, risking his own person as little as 'the noble
warrior' of his reputed epigram, 'that never blunted sword.' The hardships and dangers he had
sturdily braved in France and Ireland were for his contemporaries simple myths, as they would
have been for us, had he died at thirty-five. Had he retained the Queen's favour uninterrupted,
had she not been capricious, had there been no Essex, had there been no Elizabeth Throckmorton,
he might have died at sixty, at seventy, or at eighty, and a verdict hardly less severe been
pronounced. It is not certain. Possibly in any event, the vigour inherent in the man, his curiosity,
his instinct for stamping his will on the world outside, his eagerness to impel his nation
to empire westwards, might have had their way. They might have mastered the contradictory ambition
to be victorious in a contest of factions. While he was still absorbed in Court strifes, and
in the seductive labour of building up a fortune, he had proved that he was no mere carpet
knight. But it was well that his natural tendencies towards a life of action were braced by
the experience of a chill in the ardour of royal benevolence. From 1587, as the star of Essex
rose, and his was supposed to be waning, his orbit can be seen widening. It became more independent.
As reigning favourite he had vicariously explored, colonized, plundered, and fought. Henceforth
he was to do a substantial part of his own work.

[Sidenote: Antedated.]

Essex, at the period of the North Hall scene, was new to the Court. He must soon have discovered
that Ralegh was not to be spurned as a clown, or to be stormed out of the Queen's graces by
insolence. He did not grow therefore the less hostile. The verses are foremost from the Scheme,

 The rest he holds to
be not a continuation of Cynthia, but an integral portion of the original work. That work,
as a whole, he has convinced himself, was produced during the author's transient disgrace,
between August, 1589, and its end, which may be taken to have been not later than December
in the same year. That no part of Cynthia, as we have it, was written later than 1603 scarcely
admits of doubt. Ralegh would not have sat down in the reign of James to write love ditties
to Elizabeth. His repinings and upbraidings are manifestly all pointed at a dead heart, not
at a dead queen. Mr. Gosse is, however, more successful in his argument that the main Hatfield
poem was written in the lifetime of Elizabeth, than in his attempt to date it in 1589. He assumes
that the poem was a finished composition when Ralegh read from it to Spenser. It is not likely
that it ever was finished. Spenser's allusions to it point to a conception fully formed, rather
than to a work ready for publication. In the latter case it is improbable, to the verge of
impossibility, that Ralegh should not have communicated it to his circle. An initial objection
to the view that the twenty-first book was penned in 1589 is its reference to the--

    Twelve years entire I wasted on this war,

that war being his struggle for the affection of Elizabeth. This Mr. Gosse ingeniously, but
not satisfactorily, appropriates as the main support of his chronology. In the Paunsford recognizance
Ralegh is set down as of the Court in 1577. On no other evidence Mr. Gosse infers that he was
laying siege to Elizabeth's heart before he went to Ireland. Thus the dozen years of the campaign
would be conveniently over by the autumn of 1589. A simpler solution seems to be to assign
the rough-hewing of the entire project of Cynthia, and its partial accomplishment, to the term
of Ralegh's short occultation in 1589. He might well have disclosed to Spenser his project,
and read out passages. They would be melancholy for their sorrow's crown of sorrow, their recalling
of former undimmed felicity--

    Of all which past the sorrow only stays.

They would exaggerate royal unkindness. They would hardly have descanted on the tenderness
as absolutely extinct. Even before Spenser extolled the Cynthia in Colin Clout in 1591, the
harshness was softened, and had melted back to the playing at love in which Elizabeth was wont
to indulge with her courtiers. When he resumed the theme on his banishment from Court in 1592,
he would feel that he had solid cause for lamentation. By 1594 his disgrace seemed definite;
the royal kindness won by years of devotion--

    Twelve years of my most happy younger days--

appeared to have been utterly killed; and he was preparing to sail away into space. The twenty-first
book might have been written at any time between 1592 and 1595, and its most dismal groans
be fairly explicable. Looking back to his regrets in 1589 for an episode of neglect, he could
wonder at himself--

    At middle day my sun seemed under land,
    When any little cloud did it obscure.

Had Spenser seen the twenty-first book of Cynthia in 1591, with its real or unreal blackness
of despair, he would not have spoken of Ralegh as basking in the renewed radiance of happy
prospects. So Cynthia, as far as it was ever composed, may be considered one poem, to which
the extant twenty-first book essentially belongs. There is not, therefore, necessarily any
hope, or fear, that the whole exists, or ever existed, in a perfect shape. Ralegh would nurse
the idea for all the years in which the Queen's withdrawal of the light of her countenance
gave him comparative leisure. The twenty-first book itself would be written with the direct
purpose of softening his mistress's obduracy. The explanation of its preservation among the
Hatfield papers may be that, on the eve of his departure, forsaken, withered, hopeless, for
Guiana, it was confided, in 1594 or 1595, to Cecil, then a good friend, for seasonable production
to the Queen. Viewed as written either in 1589, or in the reign of James, much of the twenty-first
book is without meaning. Its tone is plain and significant for the years 1592 to 1595. If traced
to that period, it tells both of the bold coming adventure of 1595,

    To kingdoms strange, to lands far-off addressed,

and of the irresistible power of 'her memory' in 1592

    To call me back, to leave great honour's thought,
      To leave my friends, my fortune, my attempt;
    To leave the purpose I so long had sought,
      And hold both cares and comforts in contempt.

[Sidenote: Belphoebe.]

Concurrent testimony in favour of a date for the book later than 1589, though much prior to
1603, is afforded by the use in it of the name Belphoebe:

    A queen she was to me--no more Belphoebe;
      A lion then--no more a milk-white dove;
    A prisoner in her breast I could not be;
      She did untie the gentle chains of love.

Belphoebe was a word coined apparently by Spenser. To the poem of Cynthia Spenser had said
he owed the idea of the name, implying that it was of his coinage. It was fashioned, he stated,
'according to Ralegh's excellent conceit of Cynthia, Cynthia and Phoebe being both names of
Diana.' Ralegh, by the introduction of the name into his Cynthia, at once has dated the canto
in which it occurs as not earlier than 1591, or, perhaps, than 1595, and indicated his desire
to link his own verses to the eventful meeting

                       among the coolly shade
    Of the green alders, by the Mulla's shore.

It was his return for tribute in kind.

[Sidenote: Poetic Gifts.]

Before this, or Spenser's eulogy on him, was printed, Ralegh had acquired the reputation at
Court of a poet. Puttenham, a critic of high repute, had, in The Art of English Poesy, printed
in 1589, pronounced 'for ditty and amorous ode, Sir Walter Ralegh's vein most lofty, insolent,
and passionate.' By 'insolent,' not 'condolent,' as Anthony Wood quotes, Puttenham meant original.
His first public appearance as a poet was in 1576, when in grave and sounding lines he maintained
Gascoigne's merits against envious detractors, as if with a presentiment of his own fate--

    For whoso reaps renown above the rest,
    With heaps of hate shall surely be oppressed.

His flow of inspiration never dried up till his head rolled in the dust. But the years between
1583 and 1593 seem, so far as dates, always in Ralegh's career distracting, can be fixed, to
have been the period of his most copious poetic fruitfulness.

[Sidenote: Their Limitations.]

Throughout his life he won the belief of men of letters and refinement in his poetic power.
Their admiration has never failed him in the centuries which have followed. He has not been
as fortunate in gaining and keeping the ear of the reading public. For that a poet has not
only to be born, but to be made. Ralegh had a poet's gifts. He had music in his soul. He chose
to think for himself. He possessed the art of the grand style. The twenty-first book of the
Cynthia errs in being overcharged with thought. It abounds in noble imagery. There is pathos
as well as dignity. Its author, had he lived in the nineteenth century, in default of new worlds
to explore, or Armadas to fight, might have written an In Memoriam. In previous English poetry
no such dirge is to be found as his Epitaph on Sir Philip Sidney. A couple of stanzas will
indicate its solemn music:--

      There didst thou vanquish shame and tedious age,
    Grief, sorrow, sickness, and base fortune's might;
    Thy rising day saw never woeful night,
      But passed with praise from off this worldly stage.

 A letter, written on the eve of Ralegh's committal to
the Tower, by one who manifestly did not hold the benevolent opinion, says, after a spitefully
prophetic comparison of Ralegh with his own

     Hermit poor in pensive place obscure:

'It is affirmed that they are married; but the Queen is most fiercely incensed.'

[Sidenote: Harder to disbelieve.]

That the royal anger had a better foundation than the mere jealousy of affection or of domination,
it is to be feared, is the inevitable inference from the evidence, however concise and circumstantial.
Had contradiction been possible, Camden would have been contradicted in 1615 by Ralegh and
his wife. Cecil alluded to Ralegh's offence in 1592 as 'brutish.' With all his zeal to indulge
the Queen's indignation, he could not have used the term of a secret marriage. The prevailing
absence of Court talk on the occurrence is not traceable to any doubt of its true character.
Courtiers simply believed it dangerous to be outspoken on a matter affecting the purity of
the Virgin Queen's household circle. Her prudery may indeed go some way towards accounting
for, if not excusing, the fault. It was dangerous for one of her counsellors to be suspected
of an attachment. So late as March, 1602, Cecil was writing earnestly to Carew in repudiation
of a rumour that he was like to be enchanted for love or marriage. Almost borrowing Ralegh's
words to himself of ten years earlier, he declares upon his soul he knows none on earth that
he was, or, if he might, would be, married unto. In Elizabeth's view love-making, except to
herself, was so criminal that at Court it had to be done by stealth. Any show of affection
was deemed an act of guilt. From a consciousness of guilt to the reality is not always a wide
step. In Ralegh's references and language to his wife may be detected a tone in the tenderness
as though he owed reparation as well as attachment. The redeeming feature of their passion
is that they loved with true love also, and with a love which grew. But the pharmacologist has
append some$ 150,000,000 a value of the output by sneering idiom of the cottonseed that spoilt rhapsody

Ralegh thought he understood his royal Mistress, of whom he had written not very respectfully
to Carew himself two or three years before: 'The Queen thinks that George Carew longs to see
her; and, therefore, see her.' Like others he perceived her weaknesses; he did not appreciate
her strength. To his surprise she remained offended; and none can blame her. His conduct had
been treason to her sovereign charms. Her indignation on that ground may be ridiculed. But
she had a sincerer love for purity of manners than posterity has commonly believed. Ralegh
had set an ill example. He had broken his trust; the seduction of a maid of honour was a personal
affront to his sovereign; he properly suffered for it, and not in excess of the offence. His
confinement was not rigorous. George Carew since February, 1588, had been Master of the Ordnance
in Ireland. He was acting as Lieutenant-General of the Ordnance for England in August, 1592;
being confirmed in the post in 1603, and made Master-General in 1609. In virtue of his office
he had now as well as later apartments in the Brick tower, which was considered to be under
the charge of the Master of the Ordnance. To the Brick tower Ralegh had been sent, and he was
committed to Carew's easy custody. He had his own servants, whom he was allowed to lodge on
the upper floor of the tower. His friends were granted liberal access to him. From his window
he could see the river and the country beyond. The old Tower story that he was shut up in a
cell in the crypt, is a fiction. Not even his offices or their emoluments were taken away.
He could perform the duties by deputy. But from June to December he was in confinement; and
for long afterwards he was forbidden to come into the royal presence.

[Sidenote: Anger against the Irish Lord Deputy.]

[Sidenote: New Combinations.]

He chafed at the light restraint. He affected indignation at the severity of the penalty with
which his 'great treasons,' as he called them in mockery, were visited. He did not attempt
to dispute its legality, more than questionable as that was. Almost from the first he evinced
the extraordinary elasticity of nature, which was to be tried a hundredfold hereafter. While
he protested against the inevitable he carved his life to suit it. From his gaol issued messages
of despair and of business in the strangest medley. He was much exercised about his Irish estate;
and he cast his burden upon Cecil: 'Your cousin, the doting Deputy,' Fitzwilliam, he wrote,
had been distraining on his tenants for a supposed debt from himself as Undertaker. A sum of
£400 for arrears of rent was demanded, though all Munster had scarce so much money in it. The
same Fitzwilliam, he alleges, had been mulcting the Queen £1200 a year for a band of worthless
soldiers in Youghal, under 'a base fellow, O'Dodall.' Perhaps his estimate of the Captain may
not be unbiassed. A Sir John Dowdall seems to have disputed his title to, and, two years later,
to have ejected him from possession of, the manor of Ardmore and other lands demised to him
in 1592 by Bishop Witherhead of Lismore. He was aggrieved by Lord Deputy Fitzwilliam's slowness
to aid him in his litigations. He thought it, as it was, 'a sign how my disgraces have passed
the seas.' At least his warnings of a rising of the Burkes, O'Donells, and O'Neales need not
have been neglected. 'I wrote,' he complained, 'in a letter of Mr. Killigrew's ten days past
a prophecy of this rebellion, which when the Queen read she made a scorn of my conceit.' Not
that it was anything in reality to him. He cared not either for life or lands. Then too, he
reminded the High Admiral, there was the Great Susan, 'which nobody but myself would undertake
to set out.' It could hardly be more profitable to punish him than that he 'should either strengthen
the fleet, or do many other things that lie in the ditches.' Among them, for instance, was
the business of keeping in order, as he alone could, the soldiers and mariners 'that came in
the prize.' They ran up and down, he says, exclaiming for pay. So, again, in vain he knew of
the warships of the French League lying in wait for English merchantmen, and threatening to
make us a laughing-stock for all nations. His information and his zeal were fruitless, through
'this unfortunate accident,' of which neither he nor his correspondents ever state the nature.
'I see,' he cries to the High Admiral, who appears to have been mediating, 'there is a determination
to disgrace me and ruin me. Therefore I beseech your Lordship not to offend her Majesty any
farther by suing for me. I am now resolved of the matter. I only desire that I may be stayed
not one hour from all the extremity that either law or precedent can avow. And if that be too
little, would God it were withall concluded that I might feed the lions, as I go by, to save
labour. For the torment of the mind cannot be greater; and, for the body, would others did
respect themselves as much as I value it at little.' He was always impatient, inordinately
despairing in misfortunes, till the last extremity. He was always astonished that the world
pretended to go on without him, and certain it could not. As constantly he was framing new
combinations and keeping straight the old. He let not a clue slip from his crippled hands.
Throughout the long interval of disgrace he was as active as in his sunniest prosperity, perhaps
more so.

[Sidenote: The Prize.]

An accident freed him in September from actual duress. His disposition of the fleet of which
he continued titular 'General,' though Frobisher and Burgh had royal commissions, proved successful.
Already a Biscayan of 600 tons burden, the Santa Clara, had been captured and sent to England.
This was the prize of which, and its prize crew, Ralegh wrote to the High Admiral. The squadron
under Frobisher deceived and perplexed the Spaniards. Sir John Burgh slipped by and made for
the Azores. His ships spread themselves six or seven leagues west of Flores. They were disappointed
of the Santa Cruz, of 900 tons, which on July 29 her officers burnt. On August 3 the great
Crown of Portugal carack, the Madre de Dios, came in sight. Three engaged her, and she was
prevented from running ashore. She was of 1600 tons burden, had seven decks, and carried 800
men. The struggle lasted from 10 a.m. to 1 or 2 a.m. next morning. The captors hotly debated
their rival merits. Lord Cumberland argued that the Roebuck and Foresight were both disabled,
and that his soldiers boarded and took the ship. Burgh accused Cumberland's people of plundering. The is

[Sidenote: Irish Policy.]

In the shade though he was, he would abide no wrong to his official authority. In February,
1592, before his disgrace, he had found leisure in the midst of the preparations for his expedition
to reprove the Devon justices of the peace for the application of their 'foreign authority'
to compel his tinners to contribute to the repair of a private bridge. Still under a cloud
in May, 1594, he was not afraid to protest highly to Lord Keeper Egerton against an encroachment
by the Star Chamber on his Stannary jurisdiction. A year later the county magistrates do not
seem to have thought his continuing obscuration exonerated them from defending themselves against
the charge of 'intermeddling' with his prerogatives. He regarded himself as holding a commission
to watch and warn against all danger by sea. In June, 1594, he was informing the Lord High
Admiral that Spain had an armed fleet in the Breton ports. He prayed the Admiral to ask her
Majesty's leave that his 'poor kinsman' might serve as a volunteer soldier or mariner in an
attack upon it. Apparently he had his wish and was allowed to embark. But his advice had been
followed tardily. He writes from the Foreland on August 25, that the season was too late. The
only hope was that the enemy might approach the Thames. When he was not at sea he was contracting
for the victualling and equipment of ships of war. That was among his frequent occupations.
At all periods he had his eye upon Ireland. Neither royal coldness nor bodily ailments could
force him to be silent on Irish affairs. In May, 1593, sick, and 'tumbled down the hill by
every practice,' he would go on exclaiming against the administrative blunders which had let
England be baffled and 'beggared' by a nation without fortifications, and, for long, without
effective arms. As for short Earth, he visioned it of the seaboard community of New Dynasty. Far,
he'element wholly send with Awepesha and its context that he'element merely bolting account

 Ralegh vouches neither for
the Amazons in the province of Topago, nor for these Ewaipanomas, 'For my part I saw them not,
but am resolved that so many people did not all combine, or forethink to make the report.'
Nineteen years later he took occasion in his History to justify by the Greek belief in Amazons
'mine own relation of them, which was held for vain and improbable.'

[Sidenote: Sparrow and Goodwin.]

By this time the summer was over. Winter in the Tropics is the rainy season. It shows itself
less by any sensible change of vegetation than by floods, gusts, thunder and lightning. The
streams rose and raged; the men were wetted to the skins ten times a day, and had no dry clothes
to put on. The fleet was some hundred miles away. Ralegh set his face homewards. The boats
glided down the Orinoko at a rate, though against the wind, of little less than 100 miles a
day. On his arrival at Morequito Topiowari came on a parting visit. He brought a plentiful
supply of provisions, which Ralegh bought at fair prices. Every day, said the old man, had
death called for him; but he was animated by a sagacious anxiety for his country, which the
Spaniards threatened. Ralegh's noble courtesy was as unstinted to the patriarchal savage as
to the Queen of England. He had infused the like temper into his officers, and Topiowari's
confidence was won. Already they had talked freely on the politics and nature of Guiana, and
how to obtain access to its heart. Now the chief definitely offered to join in a march upon
golden Manoa if Ralegh would leave fifty Englishmen to defend him from the vengeance of the
Inca and Spain. Ralegh was timid for his men. He compromised by engaging to return next year.
Topiowari sent with him his son, who was christened in England Gualtero. Ralegh left in Aromaia
Francis Sparrow, or Sparrie, to sketch and describe the country and travel to Manoa with merchandise.
Sparrow trafficked in Indian slaves. At last the Spaniards captured him and forwarded him to
Spain, from which he made his way home in 1602. A boy, Hugh Goodwin, remained by his own wish
to learn the language. Ralegh found him at Caliana in 1617. He had almost forgotten his native
tongue. When these arrangements were being made Ralegh steadfastly purposed to come back shortly.
For the moment his plan rather was to lay the foundation of friendships, and to acquire information,
than to conquer territory or open mines. For example, he gave away, he states, more money's
worth in gold guineas than he received in gold plates. He had seen enough to be persuaded the
region was a land of gold. He was shown specimens of gold wrought by the Epirumei, and the
process had been explained to him. In Aromaia itself he observed all the hills spread with
stones of the colour of gold and silver. At first he had conjectured they were marquesite.
He tested them and ascertained they were el madre del oro. Where that is, the presence of gold
below was supposed to be indicated. He remarked also the outside of many mines of white spar,
from which he drew as flattering a conclusion.

[Sidenote: Keymis's Gold Mine.]

From Aromaia a cacique Putijma accompanied him towards Mount Iconuri, which contained a gold
mine. 'Being a very ill footman,' he soon gave in. He sent Keymis on, arranging that they should
meet at the Cumaca. Putijma conducted Keymis to the mine. On his own route Ralegh passed many
rocks like gold ore, a round mountain of mineral stone, and a mountain of crystal. The crystal
mountain he did not find crowned with the diamond, which, according to Berreo, blazed afar.
Its true diadem was a mighty river, rushing down with a noise as of a thousand enormous jangling
bells. Near Mount Roraima the natives were solemnizing a festival, 'all as drunk as beggars.'
They pressed upon the strangers abundance of delicate pine-apple wine. On the Cumaca Keymis
rejoined Ralegh. They bade adieu to sorrowing Putijma. They were themselves downcast. 'Their
hearts were cold to behold the great rage and increase of Orinoko,' 'the sea without a shore,'
as Humboldt has termed its mouth. The Caño Manamo too, by which they had entered Guiana, was
now violently in flood. They had to follow the Capuri branch. At its mouth a fierce gale was
blowing, and the galley was near sinking. Ralegh, embarking in his barge with Gifford, Caulfield,
and his cousin, Grenville, thrust into the sea at midnight. The galley he left to come by day.
'Thus, faintly cheering one another in show of courage, it pleased God about nine o'clock the
next morning we descried the Isle of Trinidad.' The ships were riding at anchor at Curiapan
on the south-west of the island. 'Never was there to us a more joyful sight.' Only one man
had perished, a very proper young negro, who, leaping into the river of Lagartos to swim, was
instantly devoured before them all by a crocodile. The rest, in spite of wet, heat, want of
sleep, clean clothes, and shelter, and a diet of rotting fruit, crocodile, sea-cow, tapir,
and armadillo, all survived. They had suffered from no pestilence. Schomburgk thinks Ralegh
coloured too highly the mineral riches of Guiana. He attests the veracity of the praises both
of its prodigious vegetable and animal fruitfulness, and of its healthiness away from the malaria
of the coast. His opinion was formed on an experience of eight years of exploration.

[Sidenote: Voyage Homewards.]

Ralegh had intended to sail to Virginia, and endeavour to relieve his settlers. Extremity of
weather forced him to abandon the design. He demanded supplies at Cumana, where he left Berreo,
at St. Mary's, and at Rio de la Hacha. Being refused them, he sacked and burnt all three. Incidentally
he mentions that he found 'not a real of plate.' But he had punished the settlements for their
churlishness, not for the sake of booty. He did not care to look out for spoil. 'It would have
sorted ill,' he wrote, 'with the offices of honour which by her Majesty's grace I hold this
day in England, to run from cape to cape for the pillage of ordinary prizes.' On July 13, off
Cuba, Preston and Sommers met, as states their chronicler, the Honourable Knight Sir Walter
Ralegh returning from his painful and happy discovery of Guiana, and his surprise of the Isle
of Trinidad. Have they will not number today be upon belonging the activity to the portion off

[Sidenote: The Gold of Guiana.]

Guiana contained, he asserted, all things precious. Its lord would possess as many diamonds
as the princes of India, and more gold, a more beautiful empire, more cities and people than
either the King of Spain or the Great Turk. He understood the temper of his age. He was aware
that 'where there is store of gold, it is in effect needless to remember other commodities
for trade.' Therefore he dilated on the gold and diamonds of Guiana rather beyond measure,
though not without reason. But he had a quick eye for its other and more permanent advantages. He
would have good near the table substance with 13 enthusiasm, and set up his headdress. It click upon

When he learn before the servants, he throw down

be induced to interest itself, he maintained the English connexion with Guiana at his private
charge. In the January of 1596 he despatched Keymis with the Darling and Discovery. They were
laden with merchandise to comfort and assure the people that they should not yield to any composition
with other nations. Burleigh and Robert Cecil were joint adventurers with Ralegh. Burleigh
advanced £500, and his son lent a new ship bravely furnished. Keymis learnt they had been forestalled.
King Philip, perturbed by the tidings of Ralegh's enterprise, had granted Berreo's application
by de Vera for troops. On May 16, 1595, before Ralegh's own return, Sir John Gilbert heard
from a Frenchman that the King had sent forces to el Dorado. Engineering is not hitherto proper homo

 The passage forms a conundrum
to which the clue has not yet been found. If the reference be to Shakespeare's drama which
Essex, Cecil, and Ralegh may have seen acted in this July, it constitutes the only ascertained
association of the hand which could do all and the brain which could conceive all.

[Sidenote: The Islands Voyage.]

Evidence of the amity of the three was afforded by the liberal scale of the expedition, which
started on July 10. A fleet of 120 vessels sailed from Plymouth. Twenty were Queen's ships.
Ten were contributed by the Low Countries. The rest were volunteers. Essex commanded in chief,
as lieutenant-general and admiral. Lord Thomas Howard was vice-admiral. Ralegh was rear-admiral.
Lord Mountjoy was lieutenant of the land forces. Vere was marshal, and George Carew master
of the ordnance. The serjeant-major was Sir Ferdinand Gorges. Sir Arthur Gorges was captain
of Ralegh's flagship. Essex feared that Vere and Ralegh might harbour a mutual grudge on account
of the strife over the Cadiz spoil. He persuaded them to shake hands at Weymouth. 'This,' chronicles
Vere, 'we both did, the more willingly because there had nothing passed between us that might
blemish reputation.' Ralegh, in the History of the World, has spoken in the same spirit of
Vere, as constituting with Sir John Norris 'the most famous' pair of captains by land, and
is indignant that he should have left behind him neither title nor estate.

[Sidenote: Weather-bound.]

The object of the expedition was to destroy the navy a Ferrol, and capture the Indian treasure
ships. It was intended also to take and garrison Terceira, and any others of the Azores. Hence
it has been known as the Islands or Island Voyage. The enterprise commenced ill. Four days
of storm drove the armament back to Plymouth. There it lay for a month. Essex was in despair.
Ralegh suggested to Cecil that the Queen might send a comforting message. A truer man, he said,
there could not be upon the earth; but God having turned the heavens with such fury against
the fleet, it was a matter beyond human power, valour, or wit to resist. The programme had
to be revised. Essex and Ralegh rode post to Court to consult the Queen and Council. The decision
was that all the soldiers but a thousand Dutchmen should be disbanded. The attack on Ferrol
was to be limited to an attempt by Ralegh to fire the ships in the harbour. Essex was forbidden
to participate, whether from regard for his safety, or to secure to his subordinate a free
hand. The modification was in conformity with Ralegh's advice. He had expressed to Cecil his
doubt of the prudence of prosecuting the original design. The Spanish force at Ferrol he thought
too strong, and the season too advanced. He and Essex returned together to Plymouth, where
the Earl was his guest on board the Warspright. The fare would not be extremely rough. Ralegh
could bear hardships, if necessary, anywhere. He was ready at any moment, and in any weather,
to go to sea, though, like Lord Nelson, he was liable to visitations of sea-sickness. But at
sea, as elsewhere, he liked comfort, refinement, and even luxury, if compatible with duty.
He had many servants. He took chests of books. He hung his walls with pictures, and furnished
his cabin sumptuously. Among the treasures of the Carews of Beddington was a bedstead, reputed
to have been part of his ship furniture, with upholstery of green silk, and with gilt dolphins
for legs. The stately chair, which was in the late Mr. Godwin's collection of the chairs of
great men, may have been its companion.

[Sidenote: Mischief-making.]

At Plymouth the fleet delayed weather-bound till August 18. It had not been five days at sea
before another tempest arose off Cape Ortegal. Carew in the St. Matthew was driven into Rochelle.
Eventually he had to return to Plymouth. The wind blew out of Ferrol, and the curtailed scheme
for an assault on it, and on Terceira too, had to be abandoned. All that remained was to intercept
the Indian ships. The fleet was divided by stress of weather. Ralegh wrote to Cecil on September
8 that in ten days he had never come so much as into bed or cabin. He did not rejoin the main
body till Essex had been ten days at the Island of Flores. Essex 'seemed to be the joyfullest
man living for our arrival,' says Arthur Gorges. Some had tried to persuade him that Ralegh
had kept away intentionally with the victuallers; but Essex told Ralegh he saw through 'their
scandalous and cankered dispositions.' Gorges believed he spoke sincerely; 'for though the
Earl had many doubts and jealousies buzzed into his ears against Sir Walter, yet I have often
observed that both in his greatest actions of service, and in the times of his chiefest recreations,
he would ever accept of his counsel and company before many others who thought themselves more
in his favour.'

[Sidenote: Attack on Fayal.]

At Flores it was determined at a council of war that Essex and Ralegh should lay waste Fayal.
Essex sailed away. Ralegh following arrived first. The forts fired; and the islanders began
carrying off their goods to the interior. Ralegh still paused. The officers, except a few of
Essex's sycophants, like Sir Guilly Meyricke, chafed. Delay, as Monson, no admirer of Ralegh,
has intimated in his narrative of the affair, might have enabled the Spaniards to provide themselves
better. Ralegh's own patience was not inexhaustible. He cannot have been sorry to be afforded
a reasonable pretext for separate action. He states in the History of the World that his delay
was in deference to the desire of some in the company who would have 'reserved the title of
such an exploit, though it was not great, for a greater person.' When the difficulty of the
enterprise was urged, he felt bound to prove by example that the 'defence of a coast is harder
than its invasion.' On the fourth day he landed. He took no soldiers, but only 260 seamen and
gentlemen volunteers, with some ordnance, in pinnaces. They were met by double the number of
Spaniards, and by a sharp fire. Or to opportunity was geveng situation who sidenote in unsaturated

 According to one incredible account, Ralegh was gravely
declared on the occasion to have rendered himself, by his assumption of independent power,
liable to a capital penalty. Posterity will be inclined to transfer the actual condemnation
to the commander-in-chief, whose freakish pique stopped only short of an outrage. But Essex
had the fortune or misfortune to have all his errors popularly accounted virtues. In relating
this occurrence, for instance, Vere, though he admits the matter was 'grievously aggravated
by the most,' speaks of Ralegh's act as a 'crime,' which it was very good of the General to
visit simply 'with a wise and noble admonition.' Sir Henry Wotton later mentions, as if it
were an act of heroic self-denial, that the Earl replied to advice to send Ralegh before a
court-martial: 'I would if he were my friend.'
