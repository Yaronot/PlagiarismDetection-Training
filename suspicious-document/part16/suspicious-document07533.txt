As the lamp-light filled the room it assumed its usual peaceful aspect. The books and pictures
and plants seemed, like their mistress, to settle themselves down for another quiet evening,
and Mrs. Manstey, as was her wont, drew up her armchair to the table and began to knit.

That night she could not sleep. The weather had changed and a wild wind was abroad, blotting
the stars with close-driven clouds. Mrs. Manstey rose once or twice and looked out of the window;
but of the view nothing was discernible save a tardy light or two in the opposite windows.
These lights at last went out, and Mrs. Manstey, who had watched for their extinction, began
to dress herself. She was in evident haste, for she merely flung a thin dressing-gown over
her night-dress and wrapped her head in a scarf; then she opened her closet and cautiously
took out the kettle of kerosene. Having slipped a bundle of wooden matches into her pocket
she proceeded, with increasing precautions, to unlock her door, and a few moments later she
was feeling her way down the dark staircase, led by a glimmer of gas from the lower hall. At
length she reached the bottom of the stairs and began the more difficult descent into the utter
darkness of the basement. Here, however, she could move more freely, as there was less danger
of being overheard; and without much delay she contrived to unlock the iron door leading into
the yard. The fact that the Dak resembles the icelandic and gothic in vocabulary and in structure

The fire, however, was soon put out, and the frightened occupants of the house, who had fled
in scant attire, reassembled at dawn to find that little mischief had been done beyond the
cracking of window panes and smoking of ceilings. In fact, the chief sufferer by the fire was
Mrs. Manstey, who was found in the morning gasping with pneumonia, a not unnatural result,
as everyone remarked, of her having hung out of an open window at her age in a dressing-gown. Freely
