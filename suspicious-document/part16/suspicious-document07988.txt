 Well, you can imagine, Rezek, a lighted
candle in old, dry wood. I think they are finally back and she was gone out, of course, but in
sheer terror I continue to dig. It would have been a spark somewhere,
may be among them. She found them strongly in favor of the plan; and, had I not
been constantly speculating about leaving for America, this scheme would have been realized.
But I had resolved to emigrate, and took my measures accordingly. I do not leave this holy touch and scorn, because it is based
on my belief. With the power of this faith has your brave army fought bravely and won. Your Majesty
undermine this belief, you undermine the welfare state. This is certainly true. Keep Grace. "

The company board had become deathly quiet. The king was visibly moved. He rose, gave the General
the right hand, put his left hand on his shoulder and said, "Fortunately Ziethen! I would like
to believe it can! I have every respect for his faith. Keep Him. It should not happen again. "

No
one had the courage to speak one word.

Even the king was talking to another not seemly transition, he rose from the table and gave the signal
for dismissal. The General Ziethen he ordered, "Come with it in my cabinet."

Böttiger

Among the large number of strange men, which produced the
eighteenth century in Germany, including Johann Friedrich von Böttiger,
the accidental inventor of the porcelain.

Böttiger was a natural corridor; he was born to Schleiz Vogt in the country, where his father at the Mint
was employed. As his mother a second time with the Magdeburg city and Major Tiemann married
engineer, he received an early lesson in mathematics and in the Fortifikationskunst, but showed
a marked tendency to chemistry. Even with twelve years he was an apprentice in the pharmacy
Zorn to Berlin, where he immediately onto Goldlaborieren presented. He was thereby encouraged
by the famous John Kunkel, who in Zorn's house wrong and was enchanted by the young people so
that it all his talents and knowledge boasted.

About this time traveled a great unknown in Europe, which under various names and often dressed occurred.
He seemed to have no purpose other than to save the honor of alchemy,
and used to enormous sums, though with great caution.

If the transmutations tried according to his instructions were and caused a sensation, he was always
far away and unreachable by name change has become. He did not easily return to where it already
been, or at least in very different form. This stranger, who sowed seeds gold, described himself,
judging from passports and the like asked, when a Greek monk begging Laskaris and called himself,
he wanted to Archimandrite of the monastery on the island of Mytilene be and introduced as such
a certification letter from the Patriarch of Constantinople themselves. As he finished speaking,
the Greek and otherwise gave no nakedness, was his Information believed, and they were even inclined
him to be a descendant of the imperial family keep Laskaris. He collected alms for the ransom
of Christians in Turkish captivity were advised, but we wanted to have noticed that he gave far
more to the poor, as earned him the collection, and therefore it did not give him much to be serious
about his mission. The news about him based on the testimony of a credible person, him as a man
signs of pleasing manners, very informed and full of interests, rather an educated Westerner, as close
to an Eastern monk leaves.

As the mysterious stranger came to Berlin in 1701, he inquired of the innkeeper; whether it is
in Berlin also give alchemists. At such fools is not a lack answered candidly the economy
and called on other pharmacists anger. The stranger was soon in the
Zorn Offizin and asked for a chemical.

The Provisor told an assistant, the Laboratory technicians to call. It appeared a young man, the
apprentice Böttiger. On the question of Strangers, whether it above the laboratory, because we call
it the laboratory technicians, he replied good-naturedly laughing, you do this for fun, because in
his spare hours sometimes chemistry experiments do. The strange gentleman liked the young man,
and to initiate a closer acquaintance he was wearing on him to produce a Antimoniumpräparat
him and to bring it to the inn.

As Böttiger brought the ordered product, the stranger talked to him. Böttiger was tame and admitted
that he possessed the Basilius Valentinus, and worked tirelessly
for him.

He repeated his visits and won the favor of the foreigners more and more. As he tried to leave at last
and the horses were waiting, he let Böttiger call again and told him that he even possess the great secret,
and gave him two ounces of tincture of his, with the Statement that he was silent for a few days
like this, it shows but the effect of the tincture may, if he wanted to be in Berlin, the alchemists
not chide more fools.

After removal of the foreigners lined Böttiger not be convinced of
the value of the gift.

 The captain, the old pilot,
every one, gazed at her as she danced joyously about the deck, with a mingled feeling of sadness
and curiosity; for our reserve while on shipboard had surrounded us with a sort of mystery
which none knew how to unravel.

As soon as I had dressed for going on shore, and had packed up the things that we had used
on our voyage, in order that they might not be stolen during this time of excitement, I obeyed
the last call of my impatient sister to come at least to see the last rays of sunrise; and
went on deck, where I was at once riveted by the beautiful scene that was spread before my
eyes. She's right, is what we in the
hole, "The student nodded absently, and then said quickly:".. It's still cold in April, "He,
the square shoulders, pushed higher and took the dingy yellow summer overcoat, which he all winter had
worn, front firmly, "we do over there to the cafe? A Tschaj will do well. Come on. "He pushed
his hand under the arm of the hunchback and wanted to follow suit him. Bohush resisted, "But
what do you think Rezek, and we were long enough in the CafÃ©" Yes, so those with = =. The
student placed the tone of contempt on the last word.. .. "I want you to talk with = =, Bohun, not
with these great men, with these artists' What are you talking about," marveled Bohun, "the people must
be proud of them," Rezek stopped and was very pale: "If these people would rather be proud of the
people. But believe me, they know nothing about each other - the people not by them and not by the
people. I ask you, what are they, then, are the Czechs, will you? Just look at some of you. The
Karas writes in German newspapers about our art. And our art, what is it? Tracks maybe how it
could sing the very young, healthy, barely awake people? Tales of his strength and his courage
and his freedom? Images from his homeland? Yes? Not at all. Of these, yes these guys know nothing.
You're not from today, as the people, that's very childish, full of desires and without a single
performance. You're finished overnight. Over-ripe. This is so much more convenient than the long
way through their own oppression through, as the people must follow it, the poor! Fast is easily
this one all imported from Paris: the dresses and the mind, thoughts and inspiration. One child was yesterday
and today is a young old man, a supersaturated. We know everything at once. And then to make his
art. To paint scenes of horror and orgies. You look in the woman the girl and glorified it in novels, then
one condemns this wench in frivolous songs and celebrates the love of man in serious verse,
and finally you are on target: you no longer glorified and condemned any more. One is tired of. It's
so beyond everything. It is mystic. It is actually not even here in Bohemia House, iwo, one
has his home somewhere - I know - at the source of life. That's funny. Not? While the people stirred
up and for the first time feels as young and healthy it is, and swells the new power of the
first timid in his veins, the artist's language dishonor in that they abuse their spring for the
ill Art of an end? "The student had spoken hot and hoarse. They were still in the same place. Attention
began to be temporary and a policeman sent from time to time over a suspicious look. Bohun looked
on in silence to the students and it seemed to him now as high and proud to extend into the night,
as over the old tower of the cathedral. - Now Rezek said in a changed voice, irritated by the curiosity
of the people, "So please come to the cafe And Bohush completely
under the spell of this command, went with..

He could not imagine that he could have said no. But when they still stood at the door of the
little cafes, he said timidly, "I can not, really, Mr. Rezek, forgive
me, but now I can not, really.

My mother, you know. They expected me in the evening.

And she was afraid if I do not come. It is so. Excuse me ... "The student stopped him short."
Then escort 'I do' He seemed now no longer freeze.


I looked again upon New York, but with a feeling that a great mystery was lying before my eyes,--a
feeling that was confirmed by the men, who came off to the ship in small boats, speaking a
language that seemed like a chaos of sounds. Had not he always scoffed at his heavy skull's sake? So, something
he must be good, right? Bang! The board is different - of course - like a window pane, and
the Bohush gets in hot hand from the dull dark chest of the father and the same as a harness
strapped around the shoulders shy, and he reached back inside and searched and examined with cramp-quality
fingers and sends the other hand to help and it can not comprehend that he can not overcome
with both hands, the voice of the Father can.

                   * * * * * Is on the evenings of early spring, the cool moist air
of who goes quietly about any color and makes them lighter and more
alike.

The light houses on the Quai have adopted almost all the pale tone of the sky and just shrug their
windows and then in hot lights go out and reconciled in the twilight when the sun is not only more
it stirs up. Then only is the tower of St. Vitus as aged in his eternal gray upright. "He's really
a landmark," said Bohun to the silent students. He survived each dawn and is always the same.
I mean in the paint. Not? "Rezek had heard nothing. He looked over to the Lesser Town Bridge
Tower, where you just lit the candles.

Bohun went on: "I know my mother Prague to the heart - to the heart,"
he repeated, as if someone had questioned his claim, "because that
is what his heart, the Lesser Town with the Prague Castle.

In the heart is always the most secret and, you see, there is much
in these old houses clandestine.

I must tell you, Rezek, because you are from the country who may not know it yet. But since it gives
old chapel, Jesus, and what are there for strange things. Images and traffic lights, and all
the boxes, Rezek, I lie ', not all the boxes full of gold.
 My strength left me, and my composure dissolved in a flood of tears. The good people
did all that they could to make us feel at home, and insisted that we should occupy the sitting-room
until we had decided what further to do. Of course, I determined that this should be for as
short a time as possible, and that we would immediately look out for other lodgings. If you knew how poor
I am, in the morning as I write in from the office, and in the evening, as I am with her mother,
she is so old and looks almost nothing. So it is every day. And on Sunday, when I see my Frantishka,
you know where we stay, then? On the Malvasinka. Where the green crosses, one as the other.
Lauter children are there, and on the narrow metal plates is only a first name it anything, 'the little
Karel "or" little Marie "and a prayer. So that's there. And there we left on Sunday. > Here
we are alone, milatschku, 'says my Frantishka. > Yes, I say, Frantishka, here we are alone. "And
yet I know that we are in a noisy death. Does what it? There is always something in between, sometimes
spring, sometimes snow. - Oh, I'm so a poor guy "Well, now," soothed
Rezek, and they stood before the house in which informed the Bohush
under the umbrella of two rooms with his old mother..

The student seemed to be in a hurry. "They are not angry with me, Mr. Rezek," asked the hunchback.
"This is not a reason," said that hasty, "and good night. I see you, indeed, "tomorrow at the CafÃ©"
Yes, tomorrow, maybe - though it's Sunday, I must with my Frantishka - yes -. Good night, "Rezek,
who had already made a few steps returned suddenly.

He put his hand on the shoulder of the restless little ones and said
without any particular emphasis on very quickly, "Really, you made
me curious, Bohush that you have.

If you do not even take me to the basement?

"... "Cellar?" Oh, you know, to that hole. "Oh yes, if you do, certainly. Well," "So soon,
when ?...Â«" When you want to. "" Tomorrow morning? " "Tomorrow morning."
And given the hour. - * * * * * There was no one noticed that Bohush
on Sunday morning a guest in the basement of the old dark house on
Jerome Street headed.

The two were also so cautiously descended, as if to
not wake a sleeping down the wood had been cleared away and then
the stranger, who was very silent, crept with a lantern in the secret
passage.

The hunchback stood and stared at him.

Remained bright for a while the hole, then gone out there at the
edges of the streaks and then a few reflections were fluttering in
the black frame back and forth beating, sore from the walls of the
wings, and fell dead in the limitless darkness.

Bohush listened.

Footsteps echoed far and further on.

                   Since he was a male angst.

He thought: What does it mean?

At last he heard no more steps, and now he began to shout.

His words had a strange sound, they carried with the beating of his
heart, which he felt in the throat, which is always wild and impetuous
was: "Be careful.

Rezek! - Rezek, please go no further.

What are you doing? But, but!

You must not go further.

Here, here. Do you hear? Jesus Maria, where are you? No nonsense, one can not know ... "Suddenly
fell the full light of the lantern to him, that was so surprising that the boy for a while kept all
signs of terror and fear and confusion in his breathless looked funny enough. Rezek was a jump
next to him, but he seemed not to notice. A certain satisfaction shone in his dark eyes extinguished
quickly and there was that strict seclusion of his face, which petrified every line. "Well?"
Bohush brought out at last, and the other took the lantern from the hand to have the light very
close and very secure. The student came to him at once very simple, almost a little funny before,
and noticed as he does, that in his fear all the time to the opposite side, where no hole was,
had called, melted his anxiety, she ran, as it of his form down in a boisterous, brassy laughter.
He was now in the mood to find anything cheerful, and it seemed to him a delicious fun that
the haggard student, the wood again before the secret door and coated in such important and solemn behaved.
In the ascent, he asked Rezek, but now he wants to come up to him. His mother was certainly
still at home and he would not be sorry to hear nice stories and perhaps a glass of Gilka (yes,
he possessed such delicacies, the poor Bohush) to drink. The student apologized shortly. He had
urgent commitments and would make a come another time. Incidentally, this was pretty interesting
down there - and he also like to thank you very much. Bohun was very disappointed and he would now
like to tell it like it. But Rezek could not ask for. He bowed briefly, and went and still
heard as the hunchback, the overzealous waded up the stairs, first floor a very loud somebody
called out "Good morning".
 The familiarity that he mingled in his conversation while trying
to be friendly made me thoroughly indignant: I turned my back upon him, saying that I did not
need his services. It was not long before I saw him besieging my sister Anna, who had come
with Mr. G.; being nervous lest I might not have found the ship. What he said to her, I do
not know. When no royalty was present, Zietlow had always on the
side of the king. He was once invited to have lunch with him on Good Friday, but Ziethen was apologetic
for not being able to attend because he had devoted himself to always participating in Holy Communion
during special religious events.The next time he sat at the royal table in Sanssouci, he was cheerful,
happy and witty. The King responded to his last joke by saying, "Well, Zietlow, how would you like
to get the Lord's Supper on Good Friday?
 I ask of you, what is
this for? Hatred makes for great sadness. Should the Germans do what they want? They do not
understand our country, and therefore they can never take it away from us. On the borders there are
great forests and mountains where the Germans sit fast. Is this not true? But they actually only frame
the country. What lies within, the many fields, the meadows, and rivers, that is our homeland,
that belongs to us, as we belong to it, along with everything in
usâ âAs Slaves,ââinterjected Rezek with contempt.
