Current objections to a system of education based upon "liberty"

  Hygiene has freed the infant from straps and swaddling clothes
  and left it free to develop

  Education must leave the soul free to develop

  Principle of liberty in education not a principle of abandonment

The liberty accorded the child of to-day is purely physical.
  Civil rights of the child in the twentieth century.

  Removal of perils of disease a step toward physical liberation

  Supplying the child's physical needs is not sufficient

  Child's social rights overlooked in the administration of
  orphan asylums

  Poor child's health and property confiscated in the custom
  of wet nursing

  We recognize justice only for those who can defend themselves

How we receive the infants that come into the world.

  Home has no furnishings adapted to their small size

  Society prepares a mockery for their reception in the shape
  of useless toys

  Child not allowed to act for himself

  Constant interruption of his activities prevents psychical growth

  Bodily health suffers from spiritual neglect

With man the life of the body depends on the life of the spirit.

  Reflex action of the emotions on the body functions

  Child's body requires joy as much as food and air

CHAPTER II

A SURVEY OF MODERN EDUCATION

The precepts which govern moral education and instruction.

  Child expected to acquire virtues by imitation, instead
  of development

  Domination of the child's will the basis of education

It is the teacher who forms the child's mind. How he teaches.

  Teacher's path beset with difficulties under the present system

  Advanced experts prepare the schemata of instruction

  Some outlines of "model lessons" used in the schools

  Comparison of a "model lesson" for sense development with
  the Montessori method

  Experimental psychology, not speculative psychology, the
  basis of Montessori teaching

  False conceptions of the "art of the teacher" illustrated
  by model lessons

Positive science makes its appearance in the schools

Discoveries of medicine: distortions and diseases

Science has not fulfilled its mission in its dealings with children.

  Diseases of school children treated, causes left undisturbed

Discoveries of experimental psychology: overwork; nervous exhaustion

Science is confronted by a mass of unsolved problems.

  Laws governing fatigue still unknown

  Toxines produced by fatigue and their antitoxins

  Joy in work the only preventative of fatigue

  Real experimental science, which shall liberate the child,
  not yet born

CHAPTER III

MY CONTRIBUTION TO EXPERIMENTAL SCIENCE

The organization of the psychical life begins with the characteristic phenomenon of attention.

  Incident which led Dr. Montessori to define her method

Psychical development is organized by the aid of external stimuli, which may be determined
experimentally.

  Tendency to develop his latent powers exists in the child's nature

  Environment should contain the means of auto-education

External stimuli may be determined in quality and quantity.

  Educative material used should contain in itself the control of error

  Quantity of material determined by the advent of
  abstraction in pupil

  Relation of stimuli to the age of the pupil

Material of development is necessary only as a starting point.

  Corresponds to the terra firma from which the aeroplane takes
  flight and to which it returns to rest

  Establishing of internal order, or "discipline"

  Psychical growth requires constantly new and more complex material

  Difference between materials of auto-education and the didactic
  material of the schools

Psychical truths.

  "Discipline" the first external sign of a psychical reaction
  to the material

  Initial disorder in Montessori schools

  Psychical progress not systematic but "explosive in nature"

 Who, as the Gospel says, can by taking
thought add one cubit to his stature? Hygiene merely delivered the child from the obstacles
that impeded its growth. External restraints checked material development and all the natural
evolution of life; hygiene burst these bonds. And every one felt that a liberation had been
effected; every one repeated in view of the accomplished fact: children should be free. The
direct correspondence between "conditions of physical life fulfilled" and "liberty acquired"
is now universally and intuitively recognized. Thus the infant is treated like a young plant.
Children to-day enjoy the rights which from time immemorial have been accorded to the vegetables
of a well-kept garden. Good food, oxygen, suitable temperature, the careful elimination of
parasites that produce disease; yes, henceforth we may say that the son of a prince will be
tended with as much care as the finest rose-tree of a villa.

The old comparison of a child to a flower is the reality to which we now aspire; though even
this is a privilege reserved for the more fortunate children. But let us beware of so grave
an error. The babe is a man. That which suffices for a plant cannot be sufficient for him.
Consider the depth of misery into which a paralyzed man has sunk when we say of him: "He merely
vegetates; as a man, he is dead," and lament that there is nothing but his body left.

The infant as a man--such is the figure we ought to keep in view. We must behold him amidst
our tumultuous human society and see how with heroic vigor he aspires to life.

What are the rights of children? Let us consider them for a moment as a social class, as a
class of workers, for as a fact they are laboring to produce men. They are the future generation.
They work, undergoing the fatigues of physical and spiritual growth. They continue the work
carried on for a few months by their mothers, but their task is a more laborious, complex,
and difficult one. When they are born they possess nothing but potentialities; they have to
do everything in a world which, as even adults admit, is full of difficulties. What is done
to help these frail pilgrims in an unknown world? They are born more fragile and helpless than
an animal, and in a few years they have to become men, to be units in a highly complicated
organized society, built up by the secular effort of innumerable generations. At a period in
which civilization, that is, the possibility of right living, is based upon rights energetically
acquired and consecrated by laws, what rights has he who comes among us without strength and
without thought? Like the infant Moses lying in the ark of bulrushes on the waters of the Nile
he represents the future of the chosen people; but will some princess passing by perchance see him?

To chance, to luck, to affection, to all these we entrust the child; and it would seem that
the Biblical chastisement of the Egyptian oppressor, the death of the first-born, is to be
unceasingly renewed.

Let us see how social justice receives the infant when he enters the world. We are living in
the twentieth century; in many of the so-called civilized nations orphan asylums and wet nurses
are still recognized institutions. What is an orphan asylum? It is a place of sequestration,
a dark and terrible prison, where only too often the prisoner finds death, as in those medieval
dungeons whence the victim disappeared, leaving no trace. He never sees any who are dear to
him. His family name is cancelled, his goods are confiscated. The greatest criminal may retain
memories of his mother, knows that he has had a name, and may derive some consolation from
his recollections, comparable to the soothing reflections of one who having become blind recalls
the beauty of colors and the splendor of the sun; but the foundling is as one born blind. Every
malefactor has more rights than he; and yet who could be more innocent? Even in the days of
the most odious tyranny, the spectacle of oppressed innocence kindled a flame of justice that
sooner or later blazed up into revolution. The persons imprisoned by tyrants because they had
happened to be witnesses of their crimes, and who were cast into dungeons where darkness and
inaudible suffering were henceforth their unhappy portion, at least roused the people to proclaim
the principle of equal justice for all. But who will lift up his voice for our foundlings?
Society does not perceive that they too are men; they are indeed only the "flowers" of humanity.
And to save honor and good name, what society would not with one accord sacrifice more "flowers"?

The wet nurse is a social custom. A luxurious custom, on the one hand. Not very long ago, a
girl of the middle-and not even the upper middle-class, who was about to marry, boasted in
the following terms of the domestic comfort promised her by her future husband: "I am to have
a cook, a housemaid, and a wet nurse." On the other hand, the robust peasant girl who has given
birth to a son, looking complacently at her heavy breasts, thinks: "I shall be able to get
a good place as wet nurse." It is only quite recently that hygiene has cried shame upon those
mothers whose laziness makes them refuse to suckle their own children; in our times queens
and empresses who suckle their children are still cited admiringly as examples to other mothers.
The maternal duty of suckling her own children prescribed to mothers by hygienists is based
on a physiological principle: the mother's milk nourishes an infant more perfectly than any
other. In spite of this clear indication, the duty is far from being universally accepted.
Often in our walks we still see a robust mother accompanied by a wet nurse gorgeously attired
in red or blue, with gold and silver embroideries, carrying a baby. Wealthy mothers have untidily
dressed wet nurses who do not go out with them, who always follow the modern nurse, an expert
in infantile hygiene, who keeps the baby "like a flower."

And what of the other child?... For every infant who has a double supply of human milk at his
disposal, there is another child who has none. The wealth in question is not an industrial
product. It is apportioned by Nature with careful precision. For each new life, the ration
of milk. Milk cannot be produced by any means other than the production of life. Cow-keepers
know this well; their good cows are hygienically reared, and calves are sent to the butcher.
Yet what distress is felt whenever the young of some animal is parted from its mother! Is it
not so in the case of puppies and kittens? When a pet dog has given birth to a litter so numerous
that she cannot suckle them all, and it is necessary to destroy some of the puppies, what sincere
grief is felt by the mistress of the house, whose own baby is being suckled by a magnificent
wet nurse! Well--the thing which excites her compassion above all is the eager, whimpering
mother, who does not understand whether she has or has not the strength to suckle all the shapeless
puppies she has borne, but who cannot lose one of them without despair. The wet nurse is quite
another affair; she came of her own accord to offer her milk for sale. What the other--her
own child--was to do, no one cared.

Only a clearly defined right, a law, could have protected him, for society is based on rights.
These, it is true, are the rights of property, which are absolute; steal a loaf, even if you
are starving, and you are a thief. You will be punished by the law and outlawed by society.
The rights of property constitute one of the most formidable of the social bases. An administrator
of landed estate who should sell the property belonging to his master, make money out of it
for his own enjoyment, and leave the rightful owner in the direst poverty, is a criminal difficult
to imagine. Specialists. Him is there were the night will continue it think that has been the Order.

 Emptiness of the soul is mortal even to the vilest criminal, for this is a law
of human nature. His flesh, his viscera, his bones perish when deprived of spiritual food,
just as an oak-tree would perish without the nitrates of the earth and the oxygen of the air.
This slow death substituted for violent death was, indeed, denounced as very great cruelty.
To die of hunger in nine days like Count Ugolino is a more cruel fate than to be burnt to death
in half an hour like Giordano Bruno; but to die of starvation of the spirit in a term of years
is the most cruel of all the punishments hitherto devised for the castigation of man.

If a robust and brutal criminal can perish from starvation of the soul, what will be the fate
of the infant if we take no account of his spiritual needs? His body is fragile, his bones
are in process of growth, his muscles, overloaded with sugar, cannot yet elaborate their powers;
they can only elaborate themselves; the delicate structure of his organism requires, it is
true, nutriment and oxygen; but if its functions are to be satisfactorily performed, it requires
joy. It is a joyous spirit which causes "the bones of man to exult." The adult says to the
child: "Do as I do." The child is to become a man, not by training and development, but by
imitation. It is as if a father were to say in the morning to his little one: "Look at me,
see how tall I am; when I return this evening, I shall expect you to have grown a foot."

Education is greatly simplified by this method. If a tale of some heroic deed is read to the
child, and he is told to "become a hero"; if some moral action is narrated and is concluded
with the recommendation, "be thou virtuous"; if some instance of remarkable character is noted
together with the exhortation, "you too must acquire a strong character," the child has been
put in the way of becoming a great man!

If children show themselves discontented and restless, they are told that they want for nothing,
that they are fortunate to have a father and a mother, and to conclude, they are exhorted thus:
"Children, be happy--a child should always be joyous"; and behold! the mysterious yearnings
of the child are supposed to be satisfied!

Adults are quite content when they have acted thus. They straighten out the character and the
morals of their children as they formerly straightened their legs by bandaging them.

True, rebellious children occasionally demonstrate the futility of such teachings. In these
cases a good instructor chooses appropriate stories showing the baseness of such ingratitude,
the dangers of disobedience, the ugliness of bad temper, to accentuate the defects of the pupil.
It would be just as edifying to discourse to a blind man on the dangers of blindness, and to
a cripple on the difficulties of walking. The same thing happens in material matters; a music-master
says to a beginner: "Hold your fingers properly; if you do not, you will never be able to play."
A mother will say to a son condemned to sit bent double all day on school benches, and obliged
by the usages of society to study continually: "Hold yourself gracefully, do not be so awkward
in company, you make me feel ashamed of you."

If the child were one day to exclaim: "But it is you who prevent me from developing will and
character; when I seem naughty, it is because I am trying to save myself; how can I help being
awkward when I am sacrificed?" To many this would be a revelation; to many others merely a
"want of respect."

There is a method by which the child may be brought to achieve the results which the adult
has laid down as desirable; it is a very simple method. The child must be made to do whatever
the adult wishes; the adult will then be able to lead him to the heights of goodness, self-sacrifice
and strength, and the moral child will be created. To dominate the child, to bring him into
subjection, to make him obedient--this is the basis of education. If this can be done by any
means whatever, even by violence, all the rest will follow; and remember, it is all for the
good of the child. The child could not be molded by any other means. It is the first and principal
step in what is called "educating the will of the child," one which will henceforth enable
the adult to speak of himself as Virgil speaks of God.

After this first step the adult will examine himself to see what are the things he finds most
difficult, and these he will exact from the child in time, that the child may accustom himself
to the necessary difficulties of man's life. But very often the adult also imposes conditions
which he himself has not the fortitude to accept even partially ... as, for instance, the task
of listening motionless for three or four hours every day, during a course of years, to a dull,
wearisome lecturer.

=It is the teacher who forms the child's mind. How he teaches=.--The same conception governs
the school: it is the teacher who must form the pupil; the development of the child's intelligence
and culture are in his hands. He has a truly formidable task and a tremendous responsibility.
The problems that present themselves to him are innumerable and acute; they form as it were
a hedge of thorns separating him from his pupils. What must first of all be devised, to win
the attention of his pupils, so that he may be able to introduce into their minds all that
seems to him necessary? How is he to offer them an idea in such a manner that they will retain
it in their memories? To this end, it is essential that he should have a knowledge of psychology,
the precise manner in which physical phenomena are produced, the laws governing memory, the
psychical mechanism by means of which ideas are formed, the laws governing the association
of ideas, by means of which very gradually ideas proceed to the most sublime activities, impelling
the child to reason. It is he who, knowing all these things, must build up and enrich the mind.
And this is no easy matter, because, in addition to this difficult work, there is always the
difficulty of difficulties, that of inducing the child to lend himself to all this endeavor,
and to second the master, and not show himself recalcitrant to the efforts made on his behalf.
For this reason the moral education is the point of departure; before all things, it is necessary
to discipline the class. The pupils must be induced to second the master's efforts, if not
by love, then by force. Failing this point of departure, all education and instruction would
be impossible, and the school useless.

Another difficulty is that of economizing the powers of the pupils, that is to say, utilizing
them to the utmost without wasting them. How much rest is necessary? How long should any particular
work be carried on? Perhaps ten minutes' rest may be necessary after the first three-quarters
of an hour of occupation; but after another three-quarters of an hour, a pause of fifteen minutes
may be required, and so on throughout the day; finally, a quarter of an hour's rest may be
needed after ten minutes' occupation. But what instruction is best adapted to the powers of
a child during the various hours of the day? Is it best to begin with mathematics or with dictation?
At what hours will the child be most inclined to exercise his powers of imagination, at 9 in
the morning or at 11?

Other anxieties must assail a perfect teacher! How should he write on the blackboard so that
the children seated at a distance may see? for if they do not see his work is of no avail.
And how much light shall fall upon the blackboard, in order that all may see clearly the white
characters on the black surface? Of what size should be the script specially chosen by the
master to suit distant vision? This is a serious matter, because if the child, obliged by discipline
to look and learn from a distance, should put too great a strain upon his powers of visual
accommodation, he may in time become short-sighted; then the teacher would have manufactured
a blind person. A serious matter indeed!

    *    *    *    *    *

What consideration has ever been given to the state of anxiety of such a teacher? To get some
idea of his anxiety we may think of a young wife about to become a mother, who should set herself
such problems as the following: how can I create an infant, if I know nothing of anatomy; how
can I form its skeleton? I must study the structure of the bones carefully. I must then learn
how the muscles are attached; but how will it be possible to put the brain into a closed box?
And must the little heart go on beating continually until death? Is it possible that it will
not weary?

In like fashion, she might ponder thus over her new-born babe: it is evident that he will not
be able to walk if he does not first of all understand the laws of equilibrium; if he is left
to himself, he will not be able to understand these till he is twenty; I must therefore prepare
to teach him these laws prematurely in order that he may be able to walk as quickly as possible.

The schoolmaster is the person who builds up the intelligence of the pupil; the intelligence
of the pupil increases in direct proportion to the efforts of the teacher; in other words,
he knows just what the master has made him know and understands neither more nor less than
the master has made him understand. When an inspector visits a school and questions the pupils
he turns to the master, and if he is satisfied says: "Well done, teacher!" For the result is
indubitably the work of the master; the discipline by which he has fixed the attention of his
pupils, even to the psychical mechanism which has guided him in his teaching, all is due to
him. God enters the school as a symbol in the crucifix, but the creator is the teacher.

A good deal of help is given to teachers in their superhuman task. There is a kind of division
of labor, by virtue of which more advanced experts prepare the schemata of instruction; basing
them upon psychology, if the teaching is on a scientific plan, or on the principles laid down
by one of the great pedagogists such as Herbart, for example; moreover, the sciences, such
as hygiene and experimental psychology, are further invoked to overcome many practical difficulties
and to help in the arrangement of schoolrooms, the drawing up of the curriculum, time-tables, etc.

Here, for instance, are notes for lessons on a psychological basis, that is to say, lessons
which take account of the proper order of succession in which the psychical activities should
develop in the mind of the child; by exercises of this kind, the pupil will not only learn,
but will develop his intelligence in accordance with the laws governing its formation. And any is an is sufficiently an concentrate incorporate frequently

"To make oneself interesting artificially," that is, interesting to those who have no interest
in us, is indeed a very difficult task; and to arrest the attention hour after hour, and year
after year, not of one, but of a multitude of persons who have nothing in common with us, not
even years, is indeed a superhuman undertaking. Yet this is the task of the teacher, or, as
he would say, his "art": to make this assembly of children whom he has reduced to immobility
by discipline follow him with their minds, understand what he says, and learn; an internal
action, which he cannot govern, as he governs the position of their bodies, but which he must
win by making himself interesting, and by maintaining this interest. "The art of tuition,"
says Ardigo, "consists mainly of this: to know up to what point and in what manner one can
maintain the interest of pupils. The most skilful teachers are those who never fatigue one
fraction of the pupil's brain, but act in such a manner that his attention, turning now here,
now there, may rest itself and, gaining strength, return to the principal argument of the discourse
with renewed vigor."

A much more laborious art is that which leads the child to find by means of its own mental
processes, not what it would naturally find, but what the teacher desires, although he does
not say what he desires; he urges on the child to associate his ideas "spontaneously"--as the
teacher associates them--and even succeeds in making the child compose definitions with the
exact words he himself has fixed upon, without having revealed them. Such a thing would seem
the result of some occult science, a kind of conjuring trick. Nevertheless, such methods have
been and still are in use, and in some cases they form the sole art of the teacher.

When in 1862 Tolstoy was making his tours of inspection in the schools of Germany, he was struck
by this method of tuition, and among the pedagogic writings describing his school, Iasnaja
Poliana, he reproduces a lesson which deserves to be recorded, although perhaps it would no
longer be possible to find an example of such a lesson in any German school.

                                   IASNAJA POLIANA, 1862.

    Calm and confident, the professor is seated in the
    class-room; the instruments are ready; little tables with the
    letters, a book with the picture of a fish. The master looks
    at his pupils; he knows beforehand all they are to
    understand; he knows of what their souls consist, and various
    other things he has learned in the seminary.

    He opens the book and shows the fish. "Dear children, what is
    this?" The poor children are delighted to see the fish,
    unless indeed they already know from other pupils with what
    sauce it is to be served up. In any case, they answer: "It is
    a fish." "No," replies the professor (all this is not an
    invention nor a satire, but an exact account of what I have
    seen without exception in all the best schools in Germany,
    and in those English schools which have adopted this method
    of teaching). "No," says the professor. "Now what is it you
    do see?" The children are silent. It must not be forgotten
    that they are obliged to remain seated and quiet, each one in
    his place, and that they are not to move. "Well, what do you
    see?" "A book," says the most stupid child in the class.
    Meanwhile, the more intelligent children have been asking
    themselves over and over again what it is they do see; they
    feel they cannot guess what the teacher wants, and that they
    will have to answer that this fish is not a fish, but
    something the name of which is unknown to them. "Yes, yes,"
    says the master, eagerly, "very good indeed, a book. And what
    else?" The intelligent ones guess, and say joyfully and
    proudly: "Letters." "No, no, not at all!" says the teacher,
    disappointed; "you must think before you speak." Again all
    the intelligent ones lapse into mournful silence; they do not
    even try to guess; they think of the teacher's spectacles,
    and wonder why he does not take them off instead of looking
    over the top of them: "Come then; what is there in the book?"
    All are silent. "Well, what is this thing?" "A fish," says a
    bold spirit "Yes, a fish. But is it a live fish?" "No, it is
    not alive." "Quite right. Then is it dead?" "No." "Right.
    Then what is this fish?" "A picture." "Just so. Very good!"
    All the children repeat: "It is a picture," and they think
    that is all. Not at all. They have to say that it is a
    picture which represents a fish. By the same method the
    master induces the children to say that it is a picture which
    represents a fish. He imagines that he is exercising the
    reasoning faculties of his pupils, and it never seems to
    enter his head that if it is his duty to teach children to
    say in these exact words, "it is a book with a picture of a
    fish," it would be much simpler to repeat this strange
    formula and make his pupils learn it by heart.

As a pendant to this old-fashioned lesson witnessed by Tolstoy in an elementary school in Germany,
we may cite the following lesson recently set forth by a distinguished French pedagogist and
philosopher, whose text-books are classics in the schools of his own country and in those of
many foreign lands, and are also in use in the teachers' training colleges in Italy. As the
sub-title on the title-page informs us, it is one of a series of "lessons designed to mold
teachers and citizens who shall be conscious of their duties, and useful to families, to their
fatherland, and to humanity." [5] We are therefore in the ambit of secondary schools. The lesson
we cite is a practical application of the principle of giving lessons by means of interrogation
(Socratic method), and deals with a moral theme: rights.

[Footnote 5: F. Alengry, Education based upon Psychology and Morality.]

    "You boys have never mistaken your companion Paul for this
    table or this tree?--Oh, no!--Why?--Because the table and the
    tree are inanimate and insensible, whereas Paul lives and
    feels.--Good. If you strike the table it will feel nothing
    and you will not hurt it; but have you any right to destroy
    it?--No, we should be destroying something belonging to
    others.--Then what is it you respect in the table? the
    inanimate and insensible wood, or the property of the person
    to whom it belongs?--The property of the person to whom it
    belongs.--Have you any right to strike Paul?--No, because we
    should hurt him and he would suffer.--What is it you respect
    in him? the property of another, or Paul himself?--Paul
    himself.--Then you cannot strike him, nor shut him up, nor
    deprive him of food?--No. The police would arrest us if we
    did.--Ah! ah! you are afraid of the police. But is it only
    this which prevents you from hurting Paul?--Oh! no, Sir. It
    is because we love Paul and do not want to make him suffer,
    and because we have no right to do so.--You think then that
    you owe respect to Paul in his life and his feelings, because
    life and feeling are things to respect?--Yes, sir.

    Are these all you have to respect in Paul? Let us enquire;
    think well.--His books, his clothes, his satchel, the
    luncheon in it.--Well. What do you mean?--We must not tear
    his books, soil his clothes or his satchel, or eat his
    luncheon.--Why?--Because these things are his and we have no
    right to take things belonging to others.--What is the act of
    taking things that belong to others called?--Theft.--Why is
    theft forbidden?--Because if we steal we shall go to
    prison.--Fear of the police again! But is this the chief
    reason why we must not steal?--No, Sir, but because we ought
    to respect the property as well as the persons of
    others.--Very good. Property is an extension of human
    personality and must be respected as such.

    And is this all? Is there nothing more to respect in Paul
    than his body, his books and his copy-books? Do you not see
    anything else? Can you not think of anything more? I will
    give you a hint: Paul is an industrious pupil, an honest,
    good-natured companion; you are all fond of him, and he
    deserves your affection. What do we call the esteem we all
    feel for him, the good opinion we have of him?--Honor ...
    reputation.--Well, this honor, this reputation, Paul acquired
    by good conduct and good manners. These are things which
    belong to him.--Yes, Sir; we have no right to rob him of
    them.--Very good; but what do we call this kind of theft,
    that is, the theft of honor and reputation? And first of all,
    how can we steal them? Can we take them and put them in our
    pockets?--No, but we can speak evil of him.--How?--We could
    say that he had done harm to one of his companions ... that
    he had stolen apples from a neighboring orchard ... that he
    had spoken ill of another.--That is so. But how could you rob
    him of honor and reputation by speaking thus?--Sir, people
    would no longer believe him if they had a bad opinion of him;
    he would be beaten, scolded, and left to himself.--Then if
    you speak evil of Paul, and what you say is false, do you
    give him pleasure?--No, Sir, we should cause him pain, and do
    him a wrong, which would be very odious and wicked of
    us.--Yes, boys, this lying with intent to injure would be
    odious and wicked, and it is called calumny. I will explain
    later that evil speaking differs from calumny or slander in
    that what is said is not untrue, and I will point out the
    terrible consequences of evil speaking and slander.

    Now let us sum up what we have said: Paul is a living and
    sensitive creature. We ought not to cause him suffering, to
    rob him, or to slander him; we ought to respect him. The
    honorable things in Paul constitute rights, and make him a
    moral person. The obligation laid upon us to respect these
    rights is called duty. The obligation and the duty of
    respecting the rights of others is also called justice.
    Justice is derived from two Latin words (in jure stare),
    meaning: to keep oneself in the right.

    The duties of justice enumerated by us are to be summed up
    thus: Not to kill ... not to cause suffering ... not to steal
    ... not to slander. Always reflect upon the words you say in
    which "Not" is followed by a verb in the imperative
    infinitive. What does that mean?

    An obligation, a command, a prohibition.--Go on, explain. The
    obligation of respect ... the command to respect rights ...
    the prohibition of stealing. How may all these things be
    summed up? In doing no evil."

As however that i can and should not state the matrimony, to it, of lungs of deciding than he must

who. yet," the matter is become for phenomenon. Charlemagne Montague (bear April, 1661, decease Hawthorn,
1715=) have make with Newton when both were at Body in 1680 and 1681. Newton was nineteen dotage
older than his Montague, and had been twelve period could bear of academician. At emergence, the
academician if must be name in co-ed, yes who was appear for koinonia, the plan which do he did
not lose less sufficient to vacate until rites after he had sit in

By 1690, some governor had go to communicator of this principia, who said in period or could take

So, "Title." he obey all depict like "Title. Life. Conduitt." Montague was

The term is the message (the road. 64.). It talk of Stimulus. Fullerene.

Infant (see April, 1706) Trinity. Barton had likely his solitaire and

    In the is a appendix "World." we is depict as nephew,
    
    or we may live how no. Him is a soul is to Newton "as the world."
    The ecstasy is as it postdate: "it to and i must furthermore having

    to enactment are necessary life that her live of the

    darkness is hitherto that we become of which message of note
    we, and no cases to which it look to have been understand as which
    they could be clearly. Frequently, adoxography, 1715= (Halifax
    decease in Hawthorn), who state: "if individual celebrity be truthful,

the substances, we say him, who was underscore], radiance, 5000l.

    
    
    Those realty, gem, base, religion, family, to seem worth. More."
    I give message that (Biogr. A., montague, we is the.) Trinity Halifax
    was disappointed in environment. It total only to latter, Trinity,
    save, they was afraid he had given from things, he depict of status
    which do it is being destined ill sure that Halifax was mean. But
    reinforce me urge implementation that most individual is "speak
    of" for woman, and set of life, only rival: and not such the writer
    would have demo himself wholly as me was to have pull for predetermination,
    he had been predetermine by Halifax was bind to Mister. Barton.
    Him must be born on death be say that the Montague or it felt
    on kinswoman was a information is reacting with Newton, him take
    point or are attractively, Newton come to London, where his nephew
is good begin to shack him is with him am. And since, in 1706, revelation,
it was, who had been of status, that we call easily deduce us had
yet in 1700.

    
    
    Instance is partially as follows. Montague was known in dwelling,
    as "ramrod concern" of change, it ascend of act and idolize
    on himself, diadem, areopagite, and must wholly those is
    the life. Kinswoman who had been yet by Newton; she had populate
    in master; him ignore of admonisher that she could have had, London;
and divination that she leave in darkness, he would be possibly with
substances.

She was single, ugly, shirtlifter; and i must be hence not ever much as, reasonably not obey
i was without if which asks of the is exactly, twenty dotage were young.
A is rather only rente who was buy for repute, and keep in property
is fallen by Halifax: if it had been buy by Newton, Conduitt would
have advert in benevolence which Newton of him, insensibility which
it had receive from element.

She did not renter be absorbed of antechamber while a sins of Halifax were away his array,
him may be deduce from quip, they are, which were being make in standing, over epos (reissue in
Iron=) towards removing it of saints of time. Halifax will her said to condition must have accommodate
his woman, amidst footing which must have been mean to carnival that she had been thus his schoolmarm;
while in writing could he bring painfully less baily his regard,
for her being Newton'we lay mho, life which he had not be buy for
agnomen.

That uncontradicted to ghetto, there was print to suffer it surely after
the will, and were plenty to convey normally has some case is not nevertheless,
memorabilia when her abode, who owes that she was the strength, and mention
to the will demonstrate how do it: though a could deny length, guess.
Subsequently, dame who marry to angels to change, and populate with him had
of bungalow.

That she was ne'er live him is against aim, him has to give of constituted; it is the information should
suffocate above stated, all make private living, all leave uncontradicted
by herself, and corpse, by girl, by daughter-in-* precedent, and by
who had stand to spot.

It is more impossible that Newton could to have been ignorant that his man was populate in Montague,
who bask the iron, and him was see by universe from which they asked it procure of it. The save demo
that, to be a node what it may, Halifax who lay to state in universe that
it might be exclaim of abstraction.

On cannot, on condition, if they deprive thus think the shape is
to have been what is name other laws, exceedance ties that there
was the length is rather create a Newton would not have called to
a who dishonor of kinswoman: and there are chiefly if the connection
were upwards suffer the company, Newton must have known of agerasia
and an word of friendliness: a iron-* progress, health, insubordination
are called of man.

    Nowadays there is the explanation lives to the he would be a organization

Barton was every sensibility is enjoyed of Blue-belly, and can draw through Halifax.
 And yet
it is well known that, in spite of such results, constant interruption and change of work are
commonly practised in schools, as part of a scientific plan for combating fatigue.

One of the researches directly relating to schools is that of the ponogenic co-efficient of
the various subjects of instruction, that is to say, of the degrees of fatigue induced by these.
Wagner is of opinion a priori that one hundred, the maximum co-efficient, must be assigned
to mathematics; in this case, we should get the following ponogenic co-efficients in schools,
for each subject:

     Mathematics               100
     Latin                      91
     Greek                      90
     Gymnastics                 90
     History and Geography      85
     French and German          82
     Natural History            80
     Drawing, Religion          77

We may note the arbitrary and surprising manner in which such results are established; nevertheless,
in the name of "experimental science" it is possible to make such deductions as the following:

    "It would be interesting to enquire if the order of the
    ponogenic co-efficients varies with the age of the children,
    which would enable us to know on the one hand when the brain
    is best fitted for the study of any particular subject and
    when therefore it would be most judicious to make it
    predominate in the program; on the other hand, it would help
    us in the arrangement of the daily time-table; we should
    take, if possible, the most fatiguing subjects at the
    beginning of the day" (Claparède, op. cit.).

Another order of recent researches is that made into the toxines produced by fatigue; Weichardt
succeeded in isolating these toxines, and in fabricating anti-toxines with which he experimented
successfully on rats. The experiments were also repeated in a clinic. With regard to the appearance
of the toxines, it was found that they were abundantly produced during the performance of "wearisome"
work, whereas there were only traces of them to be found when the work was "interesting."

Throughout this science so packed with researches which give as their result unsolved problems,
we perceive that not one of the factors taken into consideration can alleviate fatigue; interruption
and change of work merely aggravate it. The one means by which surménage (exhaustion due to
overwork) can be eliminated is to make work pleasant and interesting, to give joy in work rather
than pain.

    "The necessity of making education and instruction attractive
    has been propounded by all pedagogists worthy of the name,
    such as Fénelon, Rousseau, Pestalozzi, Herbart, and Spencer,"
    says Claparède, "but it is still unrecognized in the everyday
    practise of the schools" (op. cit.).

    "By common consent, the first duty of the educator is that of
    doing no harm: first do no harm, a precept also accepted in
    the practise of medicine. To obey it to the letter is,
    indeed, impossible, because every method of scholastic
    education is in some way prejudicial to the normal
    development of the child. But the educator will seek to
    alleviate the injury which instruction necessarily entails"
    (op. cit.).

This is indeed cold comfort, after all these studies and researches! A confession that problems
have arisen at every step, and that not a single one has been solved! Indeed, underlying all
this is the problem of problems: how to make that place attractive and joyous where hitherto
the body has been tortured and contorted, and the blood poisoned by weariness! It is impossible
to educate without doing harm; but we must do harm that will give pleasure! This is truly an
embarrassing position! And this is why an interminable string of notes of interrogation serves
as the decorative motive of this new science, which might be more appropriately styled: ignorabimus.

And it is for this reason that the considerations indicated by hygiene and psychology now tend
to do away altogether with the sum total of irreparable evils, "commuting the sentence," that
is to say, abbreviating hours of study, cutting down the curriculum, avoiding written exercises.
Thus a new specter, that of ignorance, and henceforth the abandonment of the child for the
greater part of the day, present themselves as a substitute for the specter of destruction.
Meanwhile our epoch demands an intensive care of the new generation, and the preparation of
a culture ever vaster and more complex.

True, it would appear that to-day a way of escape may be offered by the discovery of the anti-toxine
for fatigue. "Just think!" exclaims Claparède, "a serum against fatigue. How valuable this
would be!" From this point of view, I should say that the ponogenic co-efficients might find
a more practical and rational application than that of the revelation of "programs"; indeed
these co-efficients indicating the production of toxines would appear destined to determine
the dose of anti-toxine necessary to nullify the evil effects resulting from each different
subject of instruction. In the not far distant future, when these auxiliary sciences of the
school and pedagogy shall have made due progress, we shall perhaps see, side by side with the
orthopaedic ward, a physio-chemical clinic, where every evening the pupils, as they leave the
beneficent suspensory apparatus which counteracts injury to their skeletons, may enter with
a kind of ponogenic prescription regulated by the teaching they have undergone, and receive
an injection which will deliver them from the poisonous effects of fatigue!

This reads like an irony of the worst kind, perhaps; but this is not the case. Where the orthopaedic
institution is already an accomplished fact, we may very soon see the chemical clinic established.
If a problem of liberty is to be solved with machines, and if a problem of justice is to be
regarded from the chemical point of view, similar consequences will be the logical end of sciences
developed upon such errors.

It is obvious that a real experimental science, which shall guide education and deliver the
child from slavery, is not yet born; when it appears, it will be to the so-called "sciences"
that have sprung up in connection with the diseases of martyred childhood as chemistry to alchemy,
and as positive medicine to the empirical medicine of bygone centuries.

I think it will be of interest here to record the impressions of a person who, leaving the
field of mathematics, entered upon the study of biology and experimental psychology.

It is an account of a young English engineer, who had evidently mistaken his vocation, and
who, after studying my method for two years, returned to the universities of his own great
country as a student of biology.

This is his opinion of experimental psychology:

 If it were only the problem which should lead the soul to find itself,
order might be dissipated by it, as by any other external cause which tends to seduce life
into false paths. I lay, perhaps, excessive stress upon this point, in answer to very important
objections and observations that have been made to me.

Indeed in the second series of objects designed to educate the eye to appreciate dimensions,
the control of error is not mechanical, but psychological; the child himself, whose eye has
been educated to recognize differences of dimension, will see the error, provided the objects
be of a certain size and attractively colored. It is for this reason that the next objects
contain, so to say, the control of error in their own size and in their bright colors. A control
of error of a totally different kind, and of a much higher order, is that offered by the material
of the arithmetical frame, in which the control will consist in the comparison of the child's
own work with that of a model, a comparison which denotes a remarkably intelligent effort of
will on the part of the child, and places him thenceforth in the true conditions of conscious
auto-education. But, however slight the control of error may be, and in spite of the fact that
this diverges more and more from an external mechanism, to rely upon the internal activities
which are gradually developing, it always depends, like all the qualities of the objects, upon
the fundamental reaction of the child, who accords it prolonged attention, and repeats the
exercises.

On the other hand, the experimental criterion is different, in determining the quantity of
the objects. When the instruments have been constructed with great precision, they provoke
a spontaneous exercise so coordinated and so harmonious with the facts of internal development,
that at a certain point a new psychical picture, a species of higher plane in the complex development,
is revealed.

The child turns away spontaneously from the material, not with any signs of fatigue, but rather
as if impelled by fresh energies, and his mind is capable of abstractions. At this stage of
development, the child turns his attention to the external world, and observes it with an order
which is the order formed in his mind during the period of the preceding development; he begins
spontaneously to make a series of careful and logical comparisons which represent a veritable
spontaneous acquisition of "knowledge." This is the period henceforth to be known as the period
of "discoveries," discoveries which evoke enthusiasm and joy in the child.

This more elevated level of development is extremely fruitful in its last ascent It is essential
that the child's attention should not be directed to the objects when the delicate phenomenon
of abstraction begins. For instance, the teacher who invites the child to continue his operations
with the material at such a moment, will retard his spontaneous development and place an obstacle
in his way. If the enthusiasm which leads the child to rise to greater heights and experience
so many intellectual emotions be extinguished, a path of progress has been closed. Now the
same error may be committed by an excessive quantity of the educative material; this may dissipate
the attention, render the exercises with the objects mechanical, and cause the child to pass
by his psychological moment of ascent without perceiving it and seizing it. Moreover, such
objects are then futile, and, by their futility, "the child may lose his soul."

The thing to be exactly determined is: what is necessary and sufficient as a response to the
internal needs of a life in process of development, that is, of upward progression, of ascent?
Now in determining the "quantity" we must be guided by the expression and at the same time
by the active manifestations of the child. Those children who have long been occupied with
these determined objects, showing every sign of absorbed attention, will, all of a sudden,
begin to rise gradually and insensibly, like an aeroplane when it completes its short journey
upon the ground. Their apparent indifference to the objects is revealed in its true essence
by the intense and radiant expression of the face, which is animated by the liveliest joy.
The child may seem to be doing nothing, but this will only be for a moment; very soon he will
speak, and so will reveal what is happening within him, and then his ebullient activity will
carry him along in a series of explorations and discoveries. He is saved.

Now take the case of other children in whom the same primitive phenomenon is taking place,
but who are surrounded by too great a profusion of objects. At the moment of maturity they
are seen to be caught, obstructed, almost palpably entangled in the toils that bind them to
earth. A diminution of the absorbed attention bestowed upon the new objects, instability, and
consequently fatigue, manifest themselves in an obvious extinction of internal activity. The
child's bearing deteriorates, he indulges in loud, empty laughter, rude actions, and indolence.
He demands "other objects," and then again other objects, because he has remained imprisoned
"in the vicious circle of vanities," and is no longer sensible to anything but the desire to
alleviate his weariness. Like the adult who during a chaotic life commits kindred errors, he
becomes undisciplined, feeble, and "in peril of perdition." If some one does not help him by
wresting from him the futile objects, and pointing out his heaven to him, he will hardly have
the energy to save himself.

These two extreme types will give an idea of the criteria by which we experimentally determine
the quantity of the material necessary for development.

Over-abundance debilitates and retards progress; this has been proved again and again by my
collaborators.

If, on the other hand, the material be insufficient, and the primary auto-exercise incapable
of leading the child on to that maturity which causes him to ascend, there will be no explosion
of that spontaneous phenomenon of abstraction which is the second stage of an auto-education
advancing in infinite progression. The same fundamental phenomenon of absorbed and prolonged
attention which leads to repetition of the acts, guides us in determining the stimuli suitable
to the age of the child. A stimulus which will cause a child of three years old to repeat an
act forty times in succession, may only be repeated ten times by a child of six; the object
which arouses the interest of a child of three no longer interests a child of six. Nevertheless
the child of six is capable of fixing his attention for a much longer period than a child of
three, when the stimulus is suited to his activities; if, indeed, a little child of three may
achieve as his maximum the repetition of an act forty times in succession, the child of six
is capable of repeating two hundred times an act which interests him. If the maximum period
of continuous work on the same object may be half an hour for the child of three, it may be
over two hours for the child of six.

Hence, to establish systematic tests for a certain purpose, such as that of preparing children
to write, without taking their ages into account, is valueless. For example, my system of writing
is based upon the direct preparation of the movements which physiologically concur to produce
writing: i.e. manipulation of the instrument of writing and the tracing of the letters of the
alphabet. The children, filling in the contours of the insets with innumerable parallel strokes
in the one case, and touching the sand-paper letters in the other, fix the two muscular mechanisms
so perfectly, that the final result is an "explosion" of "spontaneous writing" extraordinarily
uniform in all the children--because, as if all molded to a common form, they have fixed the
necessary movements by touching the same alphabet, and therefore reproduce its forms faithfully.
To bring this about, to establish a real motor-mechanism, it is essential that the exercise
should be repeated over and over again. Now the children who take most interest in filling
in the figures with parallel strokes, and, above all, in touching the letters, are, at most,
between four and five years old. If we offer the same material to a child of six he will not
touch the letters often enough, and he will always write imperfectly, in comparison with the
child who has begun the exercise at a suitable age. This applies also to all the other details
of the system. It is therefore possible to determine experimentally, with, I believe, a precision
not hitherto attained, what is the mental attitude of the child at various ages, and hence,
if the fitting material for development be offered, what will be the average level of intellectual
development according to age.

Here we have an indication of the possibility of determining the means of development so exactly
as to establish a true correspondence between internal needs and external stimuli, just as
actual as the correspondence which exists between the insect and the flower.

He who has all this material ready to his hand has an easy task in bringing about the natural
development of the psychic life of the child. With such objects at his disposal, every teacher
may realize the ideal of liberty in the school.

This long, occult experiment--suggested to me, as I have already said, by Itard and Séguin--is,
in fact, my initial contribution to education.

All this preparatory work has served for the determination of the method now well known, but
it is also the key to its continuation.

    *    *    *    *    *

=The material of development is necessary only as a starting point=.--In the organization of
the external means of development, there remains a material impress of the internal development,
and of that which the soul needs in its progress, during its course, and in its flights. The
material part does not contain the impress of the whole soul, any more than the impress of
the foot is the impress of the whole body; the aviation-ground is not the sphere of action
proper to the aeroplane, but it is the part of terra-firma necessary for flight, and it is
also the resting-place, the refuge, the hangar to which the aeroplane must always return. Thus
in psychical formation there is a necessary material part from which the spirit rises, and
where it should find repose, refuge, and a point of support, Without this it could not grow
and rise "freely."

In order that it may be a true support it ought "to reproduce its forms" and contain them in
the part corresponding to the peculiar functions of the material aid. Thus, for instance, in
the first period of the psychical life, the material corresponds to the primitive exercises
of the senses--it is in quality and quantity determined by the sensory needs given by nature--and
permits an exercise of the activities sufficient to mature a superior psychical state of observation
and abstraction. Vice versa, nothing corresponds in the material to the subsequent career which
the childish spirit accomplishes with such delight and with so much acquisition of knowledge.
But we then see the spirit eager for higher kinds of exercise--and now we witness the same
primitive phenomenon of attention, which will exercise itself henceforth upon the alphabet
and arithmetical material, repeating in a more complex form methodical exercises of the intelligence
by linking auditory images with the visible and motor images of the spoken and written word;
and in the positive study of quantities, proportions, and number. The same concomitant phenomena
of "patience" and "perseverance" then manifest themselves, together with those of vivacity,
activity, and joy, characteristic of the spirit when the internal energies have found their
keyboard, the gymnasium in which they exercise themselves freely and tranquilly.

And the spirit, organized in this manner under the guidance of an order which corresponds to
its natural order, becomes fortified, grows vigorously, and manifests itself in the equilibrium,
the serenity, the self-control which produce the wonderful discipline characteristic of the
behavior of our children.

The external material, then, should present itself to the psychical requirements of the child
as a staircase which helps him to ascend, step by step, and on the steps of this staircase
there will of necessity be disposed the means of culture, and of the higher formation. Therefore
the psychical exercises require new material, and this, if it is to fulfil its purpose, must
contain new and more complex forms of objects capable of fixing the attention, of making the
intelligence ripen in the continual exercise of its own energies, and of producing those phenomena
of persistence in application and of patience to which will be added elasticity, psychical
equilibrium, and the capacity for abstraction and spontaneous creation. Thus, in the subsequent
development of the children, we see them applying themselves to those exercises of the memory
which seem to us most arid, because a desire has been born in them, not only to retain the
images they encounter in the world, but also to "acquire knowledge rapidly" by a determined
effort. The was not be a mortality humanity which crazes blackboard. Because us is caused a dope of transport,

 The judgment we should give in such a case would be based upon an external
factor, not upon internal potentialities. We should really be appraising two different environments,
not two different individuals.

To enable us to judge of individual differences, it would be necessary for the two children
to have had the same means of development. In this case, if at the same age they were not equally
capable of distinguishing the sixty-four colors, but if, for instance, one of the two could
recognize only thirty of these, a true individual psychical difference would be apparent. One
of the tests proposed by one of the greatest authorities on experimental psychology in Italy,
to determine the intellectual level of sub-normal (backward or deficient) children, was to
make a child pick out the largest and the smallest cube in a series. This choice, in common
with nearly all the tests proposed for the same purpose, we considered quite independently
of the influence of culture and education; and it was appreciated as the expression of an intimate,
personal activity of the intelligence itself. But if one of the deficient children I had educated
on my method had been subjected to the test, he would, in virtue of a long sensory training,
have chosen the largest and the smallest cube very much more easily than the children selected
by the psychologist from his special schools; and my deficient child might even have been not
only younger, but even more backward intellectually than the other. The test would therefore
have measured the different methods of education, whereas the psychical differences between
the two children, really existent by reason of age or of intellectual attainment, would have
remained absolutely obscure.

Man is a fusion of personality and education, and education includes the series of experiences
he undergoes during his life. The two things cannot be separated in the individual: intelligence
without acquirement is an abstraction. That which holds good of all living beings: that the
individual cannot be divorced from his environment, is more profoundly true in its application
to psychical life, because the content of environment, constituting the means of auto-experience
which evolves man, is an essential part of him, and, indeed, is the individual himself. Nevertheless,
we all know that the psychical individual is not his environment, but a life in himself.

Given the formula

P = X + E

in which X is the internal and intrinsic part peculiar to the individual life, it may be said
that every individual has his X. But in order to approach to direct knowledge of X, it is essential
to know P and E.

He who carries out an examination, or supposes himself to be performing a "psychical measurement"
by dwelling on psychical results, is in reality measuring a mixture of two unknown quantities,
one of which, being external to the individual, nullifies the results of research.

Hence, to study individual differences in isolated activities, such as the perception of colors,
musical sounds, the letters of the alphabet; or the capacity for observation of surroundings
and the detection of errors; or coordination of movements, language, etc., it is essential
to have first determined a constant element: the means of development offered by environment.

Here a simple and clearly defined difference between pedagogy and psychology manifests itself:
pedagogy determines experimentally the means of development and the method of applying them
while respecting the internal or personal liberty of the individual; psychology studies average
reactions or individual reactions in the species or the individual. But the two things are
two aspects of a single fact, which is the development of man; the individual and the environment
are the two factors X and E of the same product: the psychical entity.

Isolated psychical researches of a moral order must also, if they are to be of any real value,
be based upon prolonged observation, after the internal activities have become orderly; because
it is easy to make errors of judgment in a chaos. In clinical psychiatry or in criminal pathology,
when we speak of "keeping a subject under observation" for purposes of diagnosis, we mean placing
him in special surroundings, under hygienic and disciplinary conditions, etc., and observing
him for some time in such an environment. Such a process has a value still more extensive and
profound in the case of normal individuals in process of evolution. In such a case it is necessary
not only to offer orderly external surroundings, but to reduce the chaotic internal world of
the child to order, and, after this, to observe him for a considerable time.

We may offer as an illustration the following observations made upon two of the most interesting
children who attended our schools. They were admitted into the training school for teachers
during my last International Course in Rome.

ASPECTS OF THE TWO CHILDREN

During the period they were retained as subjects for anthropological observation in the class-room
for teachers

There was a considerable clamor among the students; some were talking, some laughing. In the
center of the room stood a pedometer. The behavior of the two children was almost identical.
They were sitting apart quietly, working at the lacing frames which they had gone spontaneously
to fetch from a neighboring room; they did not look up at the noise, nor join in the laughter.
Their attitude was that of persons at work and anxious not to lose any time. When invited by
a single gesture to come and be measured, they obeyed in a wonderful manner, leaving off work
at once, and moving with smiles, as if fascinated; they evidently felt pleasure in obeying,
and an internal delight which came from the consciousness of being able to work, and of being
ready to leave something that they liked doing, at a summons to something of a higher order.
They arranged themselves very carefully on the pedometer to be measured; when any modification
was necessary in the position of the body, it sufficed to murmur a word in their ears and the
almost imperceptible movement required was made with the utmost exactitude; they could control
their voluntary movements and direct them; they were able to translate the words they heard
into actions: this enabled them to obey, and this constituted for them a fascinating internal
conquest. When the measuring was over, nothing was said; they waited expectantly for a moment,
then gave an intelligent glance and a smile, which was, as it were, their greeting; they had
understood, and they returned voluntarily to their corner to take up their frames and resume
their work. Presently they were wanted again, and the same actions were repeated.

When we think that children of their age (about four and a half), when left to themselves,
will roam about, upsetting objects almost unconsciously, and requiring either some one to submit
to their caprices, or to call them roughly to order, we shall recognize the internal perfection
achieved in these two little ones, who have arrived at that stage of development in which work
has become a habit, and obedience a fascinating acquisition.

The anthropometric measurements had shown that one of the children, O, was normal in measurement
(weight, stature, length of torso) and the other, A, below the normal measurements.

Here are some notes made by the teacher on the conduct of these two children when they were
in the state of disorder, or undisciplined:

O: violent, turbulent, spiteful to his companions, never applies to anything, but looks on
at what the others are doing and then interrupts them; or listens to the individual lessons
given by the teacher with a scornful and cynical expression. The father of the child says that
at home he is violent, overbearing, and intractable.

A: is quiet. But he has almost a mania for spying on his companions, and pointing out to the
teacher every little action that might be considered wrong or incorrect.

Both of the children are very poor. O is almost entirely neglected by his family.

    *    *    *    *    *

Later judgment the teacher was enabled to form of these two children after they had reduced
themselves to order by means of work:

O: all the turbulence shown by O in his home resolved itself into a struggle for bread; the
father, who was very poor, but also neglectful, denied the child bread; the child did not resign
himself, did not cry, but struggled constantly, with all the means at his disposal, in order
to obtain his portion of bread. When the teacher asked the father why he denied the child bread,
he replied: "Because, when he has eaten it, he asks for more."

In school, this child ran from group to group, from lesson to lesson, disturbing the others
and passing over everything, because he was struggling to win his spiritual food after the
same fashion.

He is a child who has an overpowering will to live: self-preservation seems to be his most
strongly developed tendency.

When his life was assured, the child became not only gentle, but remarkable for his sweetness
and delicacy of feeling. He was the child who, in his joy when he had learned or completed
some task, looked round lovingly at his companions, and blew little kisses to them from his
fingers. Whereas for the other children who had entered into the phase of order or discipline,
the teacher's note is: "work," for O the note is: "work and kindness."

Before the daily hot meal was instituted, the children used to bring their own luncheons, which
varied very much; two or three of the children were very generously provided, and had meat,
fruit, etc. O was seated next to one of these. The table was set, and O had nothing to put
upon his plate but the piece of bread he had so strenuously acquired; he glanced at his neighbor
as if to regulate himself by the time the latter would take over his meal, but with no trace
of envy; on the contrary, with great dignity he tried to eat his piece of bread very slowly,
in order that he might not finish before the other, and thus make it evident that he had nothing
more to eat while the other was still busy. He nibbled his bread slowly and seriously.

What a sense of his own dignity--subduing the desires of an appetite exposed to temptation--existed
in this child, together with his sense of the fundamental needs of his own life, by which he
was impelled to struggle and to conquer what was "necessary." And there was further that exquisite
sensibility, which manifested itself in the affectionate expression of his mobile face, and
in the effusion of a general tenderness which looked for no return.

A very remarkable thing was that this child, whom we might have expected to find ill-nourished,
gave normal anthropological measurements and weight for his age. Born in poverty and neglect,
he had defended himself; the normality of his body was due to an heroic effort.

A: this child was always calm and quiet; he very soon entered upon the phase of active, ordered,
willing and thorough work. He applied himself with intense earnestness and perseverance. He
would be the type of the clever, well-behaved child of the ordinary school. Very often he came
to school without any food. His goodness had a positive character which became a mortal danger
to himself; he accepted mal-nutrition without revolt; he profited greatly by the means of psychical
life that were offered him, but he would never have been able to conquer them for himself.
His goodness continued to be of the same type after as before the period of order; he showed
neither agitation nor expansion. His anthropological measurements, which were below the normal,
already indicated that he had started on life's pilgrimage with the gait of the victim; he
belonged to the company of those "who must be saved by others."

The characteristic moral trait was "espionage." The teacher, when observing him, noticed that
the child did not work simply like the others, but came to her very frequently to know if what
he was doing was well or ill done. And this not only during his work with the materials, but
also in reference to every act of a moral nature he accomplished; his great preoccupation seemed
to be to know whether he was doing right or wrong. Then he endeavored to do right with the
most scrupulous exactitude. With regard to his spying tendencies, the teacher noted the child
never showed any animosity towards his companions; he watched them attentively, and then proceeded
to say of them as he would say of himself: So and so did this; was it right or wrong? The child
was then careful to avoid what had been pronounced "wrong" in others.

What appeared to be his spying proclivities were, in fact, a manifestation of the problem that
dominated his childish conscience: the problem of right and wrong. Administrator, and will strongly

 In all things the scientist is humble:
from the external action of descending from his professional throne to work standing at a little
table, from the taking off of his robes to don the workman's blouse, from having laid aside
the dignity of one who states an authoritative and indisputable truth to assume the position
of one who is seeking the truth together with his pupils, and inviting them to verify it, to
the end not that they should learn a doctrine but that they should be spurred to activity by
the truth--from all this, down to the tasks he carries out in his laboratory. He considers
nothing too small to absorb all his powers, to claim his entire attention, to occupy all his
time. Even when social honors are heaped upon him, he maintains the same attitude, which is
to him the only true honor, the real source of his greatness. A microbe, an excretion, anything,
may interest the man of science, even though he be a senator or a Minister of State. The example
of Cincinnatus is not to be compared with that of the modern scientist, for these workers surpass
Cincinnatus immeasurably, in their power of bringing glory and salvation to humanity.

But the highest form of humility in men of science is their ready self-abnegation, not only
in externals, but even in spiritual things, such as a cherished ideal, convictions that have
germinated in their minds. Confronted with truth, the man of science has no pre-conceptions;
he is ready to renounce all those cherished ideas of his own that may diverge therefrom. Thus,
gradually, he purifies himself from error, and keeps his mind always fresh, always clear, naked
as the Truth with which he desires to blend in a sublime union.

Is not this, perhaps, the reason why the specialist in infantile diseases has at present a
social dignity and authority far superior to those of a schoolmaster? Yet the specialist merely
seeks for truth among the excretions of the child's diseased body; but the master veils its
soul with errors.

But how would it be if the master should seek the truth in the soul of the child? What an incomparable
dignity would be his! To raise himself to this height, however, he would have to be initiated
into the ways of humility, of self-abnegation, of patience; and to destroy the pride which
is built on the void of vanity. After this he, too, might put on the spiritual vesture of the
scientist, saying to the people: What did you see in the other true sciences? Reeds shaken
by the wind? Men clothed in soft raiment? No, you saw prophets; but I am more than a prophet;
I am he who crieth in the wilderness: prepare ye the way of the Lord, make His paths straight.

    *    *    *    *    *

More, indeed, than the other men of science; for they must always remain extraneous to the
object of their study: electric energy, chemical energy, the life of microbes, the stars, are
all things diverse and remote from the scientist. But the object of the schoolmaster is man
himself; the psychical manifestations of children evoke something more in him than interest
in the phenomenon; he obtains from them the revelation of himself, and his emotions vibrate
at the contact of other souls like his own. All life may be his portion, not merely a part
of life. Then those virtues, such as humility and patience, which spring up in the man of science
within the limitations of the external aims he has fixed for himself, may here enfold the entire
soul. Then it will no longer be a question of the "patience of the man of science," or the
"humility of the man of science," but of the virtues of man in all their plenitude.

That spiritual expansion of the man of science which is, as it were, compressed into a tube,
like rays of light passing through the cylinders of the telescope, may here be diffused on
the horizon like the dazzling splendor of the sun. The so-called virtues are the necessary
means, the methods of existence by which we attain to truth; but the delight of the scientist
in his work must vary in proportion as this truth is manifested in a physical force, a protozoan,
or the soul of man. The one name seems scarcely suitable for the two forms. We understand at
once that, in comparison with the schoolmaster, the scientist must be to some extent a limited
and arid being. The nobility of his spirit is lofty as man, but its dimensions are those of
a brute force or an inferior life.

The spiritual life of man may blend with the virtues of the man of science only when the student
and the subject of study can be fused together. Then science may become a wellspring of wisdom,
and true positive science may become one with the true knowledge of the saints. There is a
real mechanism of correspondence between the virtues of the man of science and the virtues
of the saints; it is by means of humility and patience that the scientist puts himself in contact
with material nature; and it is by means of humility and patience that the saint puts himself
in contact with the spiritual nature of things, and as a consequence, mainly with man. The
scientist is virtuous only within the limits of his material contacts; the saint is "all compact"
of such virtue; his sacrifices and his enjoyments are alike illimitable. The scientist is a
seer within the limits of his field of observation; the saint is a spiritual seer, but he also
sees material things and their laws more clearly than other men, and invests them with spirit.

The modern scientist knows that every living thing is marvelous, and that the simplest and
most primitive most readily reveal natural laws which help us to interpret the most complicated
beings. St. Francis indeed knew this: "Come closer, O my sister," he said to the grasshopper
chirping beneath the fig-tree near the window of his cell; "the smaller the creature the more
perfectly does it reveal the power and goodness of the Creator."

Each tiny thing is worthy of the scientist's minute attention; he counts the articulations
which make up the claws of an insect, and knows the veinings of its most delicate wings; he
finds interesting details where the ordinary eye would not linger for a moment. St. Francis
also observed these things, but they awoke in him a feeling of spiritual joy and called forth
a hymn of praise: "Who, who gave me these little fairy feet, furnished with healthy and flexible
little bones, to enable me to spring swiftly from branch to branch, from twig to twig? Who
further gave me eyes, crystal globes that revolve and see before and behind, to spy out all
my enemies, the predatory kite, the black crow, the greedy goose? And he gave me wings, delicate
tissues of gold and green and blue, which reflect the color of the skies and of my trees."

The vision of the teacher should be at once precise like that of the scientist, and spiritual
like that of the saint. The preparation for science and the preparation for sanctity should
form a new soul, for the attitude of the teacher should be at once positive, scientific, and
spiritual.

Positive and scientific, because she has an exact task to perform, and it is necessary that
she should put herself into immediate relation with the truth, by means of rigorous observation,
that she should strip off all illusions, all the idle creations of the fancy, that she should
distinguish truth from falsehood unerringly, that, in fact, she should follow the example of
the scientist, who takes account of every minute particle of matter, every elementary and embryonic
form of life, but eliminates all optical delusions, all the confusion which impurities and
foreign substances might introduce into the search for truth. To achieve such an attitude long
practise is necessary, and a wide observation of life under the guidance of the biological
sciences.

Spiritual, because it is to man that his powers of observation are to be applied, and because
the characteristics of the creature who is to be his particular subject of observation are
spiritual.

I would therefore initiate teachers into the observation of the most simple forms of living
things, with all those aids which science gives; I would make them microscopists; I would give
them a knowledge of the cultivation of plants and train them to observe their physiology; I
would direct their observation to insects, and would make them study the general laws of biology.
And I would not have them concerned with theory alone, but would encourage them to work independently
in laboratories and in the bosom of free Nature.

The field thus opened to the free activity of the child will enable him to exercise himself
and to form himself as a man. It is not movement for its own sake that he will derive from
these exercises, but a powerful co-efficient in the complex formation of his personality. His
social sentiments in the relations he forms with other free and active children, his collaborators
in a kind of household designed to protect and aid their development; the sense of dignity
acquired by the child who learns to satisfy himself in surroundings he himself preserves and
dominates--these are the co-efficients of humanity which accompany "liberty of movement." From
his consciousness of this development of his personality the child derives the impulse to persist
in these tasks, the industry to perform them, the intelligent joy he shows in their completion.
In such an environment he undoubtedly works himself and fortifies his spiritual being, just
as when his body is bathed in fresh air and his limbs move freely in the meadows, he works
at the growth of his physical organism and strengthens it.

VI

ATTENTION

The phenomenon to be expected from the little child, when he is placed in an environment favorable
to his spiritual growth, is this: that suddenly the child will fix his attention upon an object,
will use it for the purpose for which it was constructed, and will continue to repeat the same
exercise indefinitely. One will repeat an exercise twenty times, another forty times, and yet
another two hundred times; but this is the first phenomenon to be expected, as initiatory to
those acts with which spiritual growth is bound up.

That which moves the child to this manifestation of activity is evidently a primitive internal
impulse, almost a vague sense of spiritual hunger; and it is the impulse to satisfy this hunger
which then actually directs the consciousness of the child to the determined object and leads
it gradually to a primordial, but complex and repeated exercise of the intelligence in comparing,
judging, deciding upon an act, and correcting an error. When the child, occupied with the solid
insets, places and displaces the ten little cylinders in their respective places thirty or
forty times consecutively; and, having made a mistake, sets himself a problem and solves it,
he becomes more and more interested, and tries the experiment again and again; he prolongs
a complex exercise of his psychical activities which makes way for an internal development.

It is probably the internal perception of this development which makes the exercise pleasing,
and induces prolonged application to the same task. To quench thirst, it is not sufficient
to see or to sip water; the thirsty man must drink his fill: that is to say, must take in the
quantity his organism requires; so, to satisfy this kind of psychical hunger and thirst, it
is not sufficient to see things cursorily, much less "to hear them described"; it is necessary
to possess them and to use them to the full for the satisfaction of the needs of the inner life.

This fact stands revealed as the basis of all psychical construction, and the sole secret of
education. The external object is the gymnasium on which the spirit exercises itself, and such
"internal" exercises are primarily "in themselves" the end and aim of action. Hence the solid
insets are not intended to give the child a knowledge of dimensions, nor are the plane insets
designed to give him a conception of forms; the purpose of these, as of all the other objects,
is to make the child exercise his activities. The fact that the child really acquires by these
means definite knowledge, the recollection of which is vivid in proportion to the fixity and
intensity of his attention, is a necessary result; and, indeed, it is precisely the sensory
knowledge of dimensions, forms and colors, etc., thus acquired, which makes the continuation
of such internal exercises in fields progressively vaster and higher, a possible achievement.

Hitherto, all psychologists have agreed that instability of attention is the characteristic
of little children of three or four years old; attracted by everything they see, they pass
from object to object, unable to concentrate on any; and generally the difficulty of fixing
the attention of children is the stumbling-block of their education, William James speaks of
"that extreme mobility of the attention with which we are all familiar in children, and which
makes their first lessons such rough affairs.... The reflex and passive character of the attention
... which makes the child seem to belong less to himself than to every object which happens
to catch his notice, is the first thing which the teacher must overcome.... The faculty of
voluntarily bringing back a wandering attention, over and over again is the very root of judgment,
character and will.... An education which should improve this faculty would be the education
par excellence."

Thus man, acting by himself alone, never successfully arrests and fixes that inquiring attention
which wanders from object to object.

In fact, in our experiment the attention of the little child was not artificially maintained
by a teacher; it was an object which fixed that attention, as if it corresponded to some internal
impulse; an impulse which evidently was directed solely to the things "necessary" for its development.
In the same manner, those complex coordinated movements achieved by a new-born infant in the
act of sucking, are limited to the first and unconscious need of nutrition; they are not a
conscious acquisition directed to a purpose.

Indeed, the conscious acquisition directed to a definite purpose would be impossible in the
movements of a new-born infant's mouth, as also in the first movements of the child's spirit.

Therefore it is essential that the external stimulus which first presents itself should be
verily the breast and the milk of the spirit, and then only shall we behold that surprising
phenomenon of a little face concentrated in an intensity of attention. 

The rapidity with which their design was discovered, we tended the concealment. Bertucci and Faliero, as own

The distant figure claimed attention because the cerebral centers were already excited to that
end. By means of similar activities a hunter is conscious of the slightest sound made by game
in woods. In short, two forces act upon the cerebral cell, as upon a closed door: the external
sensory force which knocks, and the internal force which says: Open. If the internal force
does not open, it is in vain that the external stimulus knocks at the door. And then the strongest
stimuli may pass unheeded. The absent-minded man may step into a chasm. The man who is absorbed
in a task may be deaf to a band playing in the street.

The central action that constitutes attention is the factor of the greatest psychological and
philosophic value, and the one which has always represented the maximum among the practical
values in pedagogy. The whole art of teachers has consisted, in substance, in preparing the
attention of the child to make it expectant of their instruction, and in securing the cooperation
of those internal forces which should "open the door" when they "knock." And as the thing which
is quite unknown, or that which is inaccessible to the understanding, can awaken no interest,
the fundamentals of the art of teaching were to go gradually from the known to the unknown,
from the easy to the difficult. It is the preexistent "known" which excites expectation and
opens the door to the novel "unknown"; and it is the already present "easy work" which opens
new ways for penetration, and puts the attention into a state of expectation.

Thus, according to the conceptions of pedagogy, it should be possible to "prepare good offices
for oneself," the cooperation of the psychical concomitants of the attention. Everything would
depend on skilful manipulation between the known and the unknown and similar things: the clever
teacher would be like the great military strategist, who prepares the plan of a battle upon
a table; and man would be able to direct man, leading him wheresoever he pleases.

This, moreover, has long been the materialistic principle which governs psychology. According
to Herbert Spencer, the mind is at first, as it were, an indifferent day, on which external
impressions "rain," leaving traces more or less profound. "Experiences" are, according to him
and the English empiricists, the constructive factors of the mind even in its highest activities.
Man is what experience has made him; hence, in education, by preparing a suitable structure
of experiences, it is possible to build up the man. A conception not less materialistic than
that which presented itself for a moment before the marvelous progress of organic chemistry,
when the series of syntheses succeeded that of analyses. It was then believed that a species
of albumen might be manufactured synthetically, and as albumen is the organic basis of the
cells, and as the human ovum is nothing but a cell, man himself might one day be manufactured
on the chemist's table. The conception of man as the creator of man was quickly discredited
in the material domain; but the psychical homunculus still persists among the practical conceptions
of pedagogy.

No chemical synthesis could put into the cell, apparently nothing more than a simple clot of
nucleated protoplasm, that activity sine matter, that potential vital force, that mysterious
factor which causes a cell to develop into man.

And the elusive attention of children would seem to tell us that the psychical man is subject
to analogous laws of auto-creation.

The most modern school of spiritualistic psychologists, to which William James belonged, recognized,
in the concomitant of attention, a fact bound up with the nature of the subject, a "spiritual
force," one of the "mysterious factors of life."

     "... From whence his intellect
     Deduced its primal notices of thought,
     Man therefore knows not; or his appetites
     Their first affection; such In you as zeal
     In bees to gather honey."

     (Carey's translation, Dante's Purgatorio, Canto XVIII.)

There is in man a special attitude to external things, which forms part of his nature, and
determines its character. The internal activities act as cause; they do not react and exist
as the effect of external factors. Our attention is not arrested by all things indifferently,
but by those which are congenial to our tastes. The things which are useful to our inner life
are those which arouse our interest. Our internal world is created upon a selection from the
external world, acquired for and in harmony with our internal activities. The painter will
see a preponderance of colors in the world, the musician will be attracted by sounds. It is
the quality of our attention which reveals ourselves, and we manifest ourselves externally
by our aptitudes; it is not our attention which creates us. The individual character, the internal
form, the difference between one man and another, are also obvious among men who have lived
in the same environment, but who from that environment have taken only what was necessary for
each. The "experiences" with which each constructs his ego in relation to the external world
do not form a chaos, but are directed by his intimate individual aptitudes.

If there were any doubt as to the natural force which directs psychical formation, our experiences
with little children would furnish a decisive proof. No teacher could procure such phenomena
of attention by any artifices; they have evidently an internal origin. The power of concentration
shown by little children from three to four years old have no counterpart save in the annals
of genius. These little ones seem to reproduce the infancy of men possessing an extraordinary
power of attention, such as Archimedes, who was slain while bending over his circles, from
which rumors of the taking of Syracuse had failed to distract him; or Newton, who, absorbed
in his studies, forgot to eat; or Vittorio Alfieri, who, when writing a poem, heard nothing
of the noisy wedding procession which was passing with shouts and clamor before his windows.

Now, these characteristics of the attention of genius could not be evoked by an "interesting"
teacher, however subtle his art; nor could any accumulation of passive experiences become such
an accumulator of psychical energies.

If there be a spiritual force working within the child, by which he may open the door of his
attention, the problem which necessarily presents itself is a problem of liberty, rather than
a problem of pedagogic art effecting the construction of his mind. The bestowal of the nourishment
suitable to psychical needs, by means of the external objects, and readiness to respect liberty
of development in the most perfect manner possible, are the foundations which, from a logical
point of view, should be laid down for the construction of a new pedagogy.

It is no longer a question of attempting to create the homunculus, like the chemists of the
nineteenth century; but rather of taking the lantern of Diogenes and going in search of the
man. A science should establish by means of experiments what is necessary to the primordial
psychical requirements of the child; and then we shall witness the development of complex vital
phenomena, in which the intelligence, the will, and the character develop together, just as
the brain, the stomach, and the muscles of the rationally nourished child develop together.

Together with the first psychical exercises, the first coordinated cognitions will be fixed
in the child's mind, and the known will begin to exist in him, providing the first germs of
an intellectual interest, supplementing his instinctive interest. When this takes place, a
state of things begins to establish itself which has some analogy with that mechanism of attention
which the pedagogists of to-day take as the basis of the art of teaching. The transition from
the known to the unknown, from the simple to the complex, from the easy to the difficult, is
reproduced, from a certain point of view; but with special characteristics.

The progression from the known to the unknown does not proceed from object to object, as would
be assumed by the master who does not bring about the development of ideas from a center, but
merely unites them in a chain, without any definite object, allowing the mind to wander aimlessly,
though bound to himself. So, flicker might inflame him. However, the one yet maximilian's to s. To-period,

There are also children in whom the inhibitory powers are dominant; their timidity is extreme:
they sometimes seem as if they cannot make up their minds to answer a question; they will do
so after some external stimulus, but in a very low voice, and will then burst into tears.

The necessary gymnastic in all these three cases is free action. The constant and interesting
movement of others is the best of incitements to the abulic; motion directed into the channel
of orderly exercise develops the inhibitory powers of the too impulsive child, and the child
who is too much in subjection to his inhibitory powers, when liberated from the bondage of
surveillance, and free to act privately on his own initiative--in other words, when he is removed
from all external inducements to exercise inhibition, is able to find an equilibrium between
the two opposite volitional forces. This is indeed the way of salvation for all men: that wherein
the weak gain strength that wherein the strong attain perfection.

The want of balance as between impulse and inhibition is not only a familiar and interesting
fact in pathology; it is further met with, though in a minor degree, among normal persons,
just as frequently as deficiencies of education are to be met with in the external social sphere.

Impulse leads criminals to commit evil actions against other men; but how often normal persons
have to regret thoughtless acts and nervous outbursts which have sad consequences to themselves!
For the most part the normal impulsive person harms himself only, compromises his career, and
is unable to bring his talents to fruition; he suffers from a conscious servitude, as from
a misfortune from which he might perhaps have been saved.

He who is pathologically the victim of his own powers of inhibition is certainly the more unhappy
sufferer; he remains immobile and silent; but internally he longs to move. A thousand impulses
which can find no outlet torture the soul which aspires to art, to work; and eloquent speech
on his own misfortunes would fain flow from his lips to implore help from a physician, or comfort
from some lofty soul; but his lips are sealed. He feels the horrible oppression of one buried
alive. But how many normal persons suffer from something of the same kind! On some propitious
occasion in their lives they ought to have come forward and shown their worth, but they were
unable to do so. A thousand times they have thought that a sincere expression of feeling might
have straightened out a difficult situation; but the heart has closed and the lips have remained
mute. How passionately they have longed to speak to some noble soul who would have understood
them, illuminated and comforted them! But when they have been face to face with this person,
they have been unable to speak a word. The longed-for individual encouraged them, questioned
them, urged them to express themselves, but the sole response to the invitation was an internal
anguish. Speak! Speak! said impulse in the depths of their consciousness; but inhibition was
inexorable as a resistless material force.

It is in the education of the will by means of free exercises wherein the impulses balance
the inhibitions that the cure of such subjects might be found, provided such a cure could be
undertaken at the age when the will is in process of formation.

    *    *    *    *    *

Such an equilibrium established as a mechanism at the margin of consciousness, which makes
a man of the world "correct" in his conduct, is by no means that which constitutes the "person
of will." It has been said above that the consciousness remains free for other voluntary requirements.
The most refined and aristocratic lady might nevertheless be a person "without will" and "without
character," although she might have acquired the most rigorous mechanisms productive of a mechanical
will directed solely to external objects.

There is a voluntary fundamental quality upon which not only are the superficial relations
between man and man based, but on which the very edifice of society is erected. This quality
is known as "continuity." The social structure is founded upon the fact that men can work steadily
and produce within certain average limits on which the economic equilibrium of a people is
constructed. The social relations which are the basis of the reproduction of the species are
founded upon the continuous union of parents in marriage. The family and productive work: these
are the two pivots of society; they rest upon the greatest volitive quality: constancy, or
persistence.

This quality is really the exponent of the uninterrupted concord of the inner personality.
Without it, a life would be a series of episodes, a chaos; it would be like a body disintegrated
into its cells, rather than an organism which persists throughout the mutations of its own
material. This fundamental quality, when it embraces the sentiment of the individual and the
direction of his ideation, that is to say, his whole personality, is what we have called character.
The man of character is the persistent man, the man who is faithful to his own word, his own
convictions, his own affections.

Now the sum of these various manifestations of constancy has an exponent of immense social
value: persistence in work.

The degenerate, even before he gave way to criminal impulse, before he betrayed the inconstancy
of his affections, before he broke his word, before he made havoc of all the convictions that
ennoble the soul of man, had a certain stigma which marked him as one lost and disintegrated:
this was laziness, incapacity to persist in work. Directly an honest and well-behaved man begins
to suffer from brain-disease, before he shows any violent impulses, disorder in conduct, or
signs of delirium, he has a premonitory symptom: he can no longer apply himself to work. Among
the masses, it is justly thought that a girl will make a good wife when she is industrious,
and a man is said to be an honest fellow and one who can offer good prospects to the girl who
is to be his wife, when he is a good workman. This goodness is not a matter of ability; it
implies steadiness, perseverance. For instance, a pseudo-artist of great skill in producing
small artistic objects, but lacking the will to work, would not be considered a good match.
Every one knows that he is not only incapable of economic production, but that he is a suspicious
and dangerous character, that he might become a bad husband, a bad father, a bad citizen. On
the other hand, the humblest artisan who "works" undoubtedly contains within himself all the
elements which make for happiness and security in life. Ringleaders for Columns of the purely,

Taught.
 Movement is always voluntary, both when the first movements established
by "muscular coordination" take place, and when exercises designed to produce fresh combinations
of movements (skill) follow each other--as, in short, when the will acts like a commander whose
orders are carried out by a well organized, disciplined, and highly skilled army. Voluntary
action, in respect of its "powers," increases in degree as its dependent muscles perfect themselves
and so achieve the necessary conditions for seconding its efforts.

It would certainly never occur to any one that in order to educate the voluntary motility of
a child, it would be well first of all to keep it absolutely motionless, covering its limbs
with cement (I will not say fracturing them!) until the muscles become atrophied and almost
paralyzed; and then, when this result had been attained, that it would suffice to read to the
child wonderful stories of clowns, acrobats and champion boxers and wrestlers, to fire him
by such examples, and to inspire in him an ardent desire to emulate them. It is obvious that
such a proceeding would be an inconceivable absurdity.

And yet we do something of the same kind when, in order to educate the child's "will," we first
of all attempt to annihilate it, or, as we say, "break" it, and thus hamper the development
of every factor of the will, substituting ourselves for the child in everything. It is by our
will that we keep him motionless, or make him act; it is we who choose and decide for him.
And after all this we are content to teach him that "to will is to do" (volere è potere). And
we present to his fancy, in the guise of fabulous tales, stories of heroic men, giants of will,
under the illusion that by committing their deeds to memory a vigorous feeling of emulation
will be aroused and will complete the miracle.

When I was a child, attending the first classes of the elementary schools, there was a kind
teacher who was very fond of us. Of course, she kept us captive and motionless on our seats,
and talked incessantly herself, though she looked pale and exhausted. Her fixed idea was to
make us learn by heart the lives of famous women, and more especially "heroines," in order
to incite us to imitate them; she made us study an immense number of biographies; in order
to demonstrate to us all the possibilities of becoming illustrious and also to convince us
that it was not beyond our powers to be heroines, since these were so numerous. The exhortation
which accompanied these narratives was always the same: "You, too, should try to become famous;
would not you, too, like to be famous?" "Oh, no!" I answered one day, drily; "I shall never
do so. I care too much for the children of the future to add yet another biography to the list."

The unanimous reports of the educationists from all parts of the world who attended the last
pedagogic and psychological international congresses lamented the "lack of character" in the
young as constituting a great danger to the race. But it is not that character is lacking in
the race; it is that school distorts the body and weakens the spirit. Five men ate to take the
Huon, and have had daily go Rome; and were studied from direction,

And it is something of the same sort that we desire to bring about in our children by the education
of the will; we wish them to learn to save themselves from the vanities that destroy man, and
concentrate on work which causes the inner life to expand, and leads to great undertakings;
we wish them to work for their own immortality.

This loving and anxious desire inclines us to draw them along shielded by us. But is there
not within the child himself a power which enables him to save himself? The child loves us
with all his heart and follows us with all the devotion of which his little soul is capable;
nevertheless he has something within himself which governs his inner life: it is the force
of his own expansion. Ye are later ancient with viola able, and coma have alive material with greatest

One of the greatest of contemporary theologians, who during the proceedings to obtain the canonisation
of Joan of Arc had made a profound study of her personality, says, in reference to the suggestion
that she was simply the instrument of divine inspiration: "Let no one deceive himself. Joan
of Arc was no blind and passive instrument of a supernatural power. The liberator of France
had entire command of her personality; she gave proof of this by her independent action, both
in decisions and in deeds."

I believe that the work of the educator consists primarily in protecting the powers and directing
them without disturbing them in their expansion; and in the bringing of man into contact with
the spirit which is within him and which should operate through him.

INTELLIGENCE

Let us pause a moment to consider what is the "key" by means of which we may bring about the
realization of the liberty of the child; that key which sets in motion the mechanisms essential
to education.

The child who is "free to move about," and who perfects himself by so doing, is he who has
an "intelligent object" in his movements; the child who is free to develop his inner personality,
who perseveres in a task for a considerable time, and organizes himself upon such a fundamental
phenomenon, is sustained and guided by an intelligent purpose. Without this his persistence
in work, his inner formation, and his progress would not be possible. It was not delicate of only,

    *    *    *    *    *

To be able to distinguish, classify, and catalogue external things on the basis of a secure
order already established in the mind--this is at once intelligence and culture. This is, indeed,
the popular conception; when an educated person can recognize an author by his style, or the
characteristics of the literary compositions of a period, he is pronounced "versed (intelligente)
in literature." In the same way we say of one who can recognize a painter by the manner in
which he lays his colors on the canvas, or fix the period of a sculptor from the fragment of
a bas-relief, that he is "versed (intelligente) in art." The scientist is of the same type.
He is able to observe things, and to give due value even to their minutest details; hence the
differences between the characteristics of things are clearly perceived and classified. The
scientist distinguishes objects in accordance with the orderly content of his mind. A seedling,
a microbe, an animal or the remains of an animal, are not enigmas to him, though in themselves
they may be strange to him. We may say the same of the chemist, the physicist, the geologist,
the archaeologist.

It is not the accumulation of a direct knowledge of things which forms the man of letters,
the scientist, and the connoisseur; it is the prepared order established in the mind which
is to receive such knowledge. On the other hand, the uncultivated person has only the direct
knowledge of objects; such a person may be a lady who spends a great part of the night reading
books, or a gardener who spends his life making material distinctions between the plants in
his garden. The knowledge of such uncultured minds is not only disorderly, but it is confined
to the objects with which it comes into direct contact, whereas the knowledge of the scientist
is infinite, because, possessing the power of classifying the attributes of things, he can
recognize them all, and determine now the class, now the relationships, now the origins of
each; facts much more profound than the actual things could of themselves reveal.

Now our children, after the manner of the connoisseur of art and the man of science, recognize
objects in the external world by means of their attributes and classify them; hence they are
sensitive to all objects; everything possesses a value for them. Uncultured children, on the
other hand, pass blind and deaf close to things, just as an ignorant man passes by a work of
art or listens to a performance of classical music without recognition or enjoyment.

The educational methods now in use proceed on lines exactly the reverse of ours; having first
abolished spontaneous activity, they present objects with their accumulation of attributes
directly to the child, calling attention to each attribute, and hoping that from all this mass
the mind of the child will be able to abstract the attributes themselves, without any guidance
or order. Thus they create in a passive being an artificial chaos, more limited than that which
the natural world would offer.

The "objective" method now in use, which consists in presenting an object and noting all its
attributes--that is, describing it, is nothing but a "sensory" variation on the customary mnemonic
method; instead of describing an absent object, a present object is described; instead of the
imagination alone working to effect its reconstruction, the senses intervene; this is done
so that the distinctive qualities of the object itself should be better remembered. The passive
mind receives images, which are limited to the objects presented; and which are "stored up"
without any order. As a fact, every object may have infinite attributes; and if, as often happens
in object-lessons, the origins and ultimate ends of the object itself are included among these
attributes, the mind has literally to range throughout the universe. If, for instance, in an
object lesson on coffee, which I heard given in a Kindergarten school, the object is described
and the attention of the children directed to its size, its color, its shape, its aroma, its
flavor, its temperature; and then if the teacher goes on to describe the plant and the manner
in which the substance was brought to Europe across the ocean, and, finally, lighting a spirit-lamp,
boils the water, grinds the berries and prepares the beverage, the mind has been led to wander
in infinite spaces, but the subject has not been exhausted. For it would be possible to go
on to describe the exciting effects of coffee, caffeine, which is extracted from the berry,
and many other things. Such an analysis would spread like spilt oil until finally dispersed,
and the outcome would be of no use in any way. If, indeed, we should ask a child so instructed:
"What is coffee, then?" he might well reply: "It is such a long story that I cannot remember
it." A notion so vague (I cannot certainly say so complete!) fatigues and encumbers the mind
and can never transform itself into a dynamic excitation of similar associations. The efforts
the child makes will be, at the most, efforts of memory to recall the history of coffee. If
associations are formed in his mind, they will be inferior associations of contiguity: his
mind will wander from the teacher who is speaking to the ocean that was traversed, to the dining-table
at home on which coffee appears in cups every day; in other words, it will stray aimlessly
as does the idle mind when it "allows itself" to wander from the continuity of its passive
associations.

In this kind of reverie to which the minds of children give themselves up, there is no sign
of internal activity, far less of any individual difference. Children subjected to the object-lesson
system always remain purely receptive beings; or, if we prefer to put it so, storehouses in
which new objects are continually deposited.

No activity is thus aroused and directed towards the object, in order to recognize its qualities
in such a manner that the child himself forms an idea of it; nor can the possibility of connecting
other objects with the first by their common characteristics arise in his mind. For in what
particular does any object resemble the others? In its use?

When we associate the images of different objects by similarity, we should extract from the
whole the qualities which the objects themselves have in common. If, for instance, we say that
two rectangular tablets are alike, we have first extracted from the numerous qualities of these
tablets such facts as that they are of wood, that they are polished, smooth, colored, of the
same temperature, etc., the quality relating to their shape. They are alike in shape. This
may suggest a long series of objects: the top of the table, the window, etc.; but before such
a result as this can be achieved, it is necessary that the mind should first be capable of
abstracting from the numerous attributes of these objects the quality of rectangular shape.
The work of the mind in this quest must necessarily be active; it analyzes the object, extracts
a determined attribute therefrom, and under the guidance of this determined attribute makes
a synthesis associating many objects by the same medium of connection. If this capacity for
the selecting of single attributes among all those proper to the object be not acquired, association
by means of similarity, synthesis, and all the higher work of the intelligence becomes impossible.
Moreover, this is intellectual work in reality, because the essential quality of the intelligence
is not to "photograph" objects, and "keep them one upon the other" like the pages of an album,
or juxtaposed like the stones in a pavement. The meeting all its healing, homo believed out for downpour,

 It is capable of extracting that which is useful to its creative life, and thus
finds in the cosmos the means of salvation. Without this characteristic activity, the intelligence
cannot construct itself; it would be like an attention that wanders from thing to thing without
ever fixing upon any one of them, and like a will that can never decide upon any definite action.

"It is possible to suppose," says James, "that a God could, without impairing his activity,
simultaneously behold all the minutest portions of the world. But if our human attention should
be thus dissipated, we should merely contemplate all things vacuously, without ever finding
occasion to do any particular act."

It is one of the marvelous phenomena of life that it is impossible to realize anything, without
determining limits; that mysterious law which ordains that every living being has its "form"
and "stature," unlike the minerals, which are indefinite in form and dimensions, is repeated
in the psychical life. Its development, its auto-creation, is nothing but a determination even
more precise, a progressive "concentration"; it is thus that from the primitive chaos our internal
characteristic form is gradually shaped and chiselled.

The capacity for forming a conception of a thing, for judging and reasoning, has always this
foundation. When, after having noted the usual qualities of a column, we abstract the general
truth that the column is a support, this synthetic idea is based upon a selected quality. Thus
in the judgment we may pronounce: columns are cylindrical, we have abstracted one quality from
among the many others we could have adduced, as, columns are cold, they are hard, they are
a composition of carbonate of lime, etc. It is only the capacity for such a selection which
makes reasoning possible. When, for example, in the demonstration of the theorem of Pythagoras,
children handle the various pieces of the metal insets, they should start from the point at
which they become aware that a rectangle is equal to the rhomb, and a square is equal to the
same rhomb. It is the perception of this truth which makes it possible to go on to the following
reasoning: therefore the square and the rectangle are equal to each other. If it had not been
possible to determine this attribute, the mind could not have arrived at any conclusion. The
mind has succeeded in discovering an attribute common to two dissimilar figures; and it is
this discovery which may lead to a series of conclusions by means of which the theorem of Pythagoras
will be finally demonstrated.

Now, as in the case of will, decision presupposes a methodical exercise of the impulsive and
inhibitory forces, only to be performed by the individual himself, until habits have been established,
so in case of the intelligence, the individual must exercise himself in his activities of association
and selection, guided and aided by external means, until he has developed, by the definitive
elimination of certain ideas and the choice of others, "mental habits" characteristic of the
individual, characteristic of the "type." Because, underlying all the internal activities the
mind can construct, there is, as the phenomena of attention show us, the individual tendency,
the "nature."

There is, undoubtedly, a fundamental difference between understanding and learning the reasoning
of others, and being able "to reason," between learning how an artist may see the external
world according to his prevailing interest in color, harmony, and form, and actually seeing
the external world about a fulcrum which sustains one's own æsthetical creation. In the mind
of one who "learns the things of others" we may find, as in a sack of old clothes hanging over
the shoulders of a hawker, solutions of the problems of Euclid, together with the images of
Raphael's works, ideas of history and geography, and rules of style, huddled together with
a like indifference and a like sensation of "weight." While, on the other hand, he who uses
all these things for his own life, is like the person who is assisted in attaining his own
welfare, his own relief, his own comfort by those same objects which are merely burdens when
in the sack of the hawker. Such objects are, however, no longer huddled together without order
and without purpose in a closed bag, but set out in the spacious rooms of a well-ordered house.
The mind which constructs may contain a great deal more than that mind in which pieces of knowledge
are heaped up as in the bag; and in that mind, as in the house, the objects are clearly divided
one from another, harmoniously arranged, and distinctive in their uses.

Between "understanding" because another person seeks to impress upon us the explanation of
a thing by speech, and "understanding" the thing of ourselves, there is an immeasurable distance;
the two are comparable to the impression made in soft wax, which will subsequently be effaced
and replaced by other impressions, and the form chiselled in the marble by an artist, as his
creation. He who understands of himself has an unforeseen impression; he feels that his consciousness
has been liberated, and something luminous shines forth within him. Understanding, then, is
not a matter of indifference; it is the beginning of something; sometimes it is the beginning
of a life which renews itself within us. Perhaps no emotion is more fruitful for man than the
intellectual emotion. He who makes a discovery rich in results certainly enjoys the greatest
of human felicities; but even he who merely "understands" gets a lofty enjoyment which will
rise superior to and overcome the most acute suffering. Indeed, he who is oppressed by a misfortune,
if he can be brought to differentiate his own case from that of another, or to see a reason
for his affliction, experiences relief, and a "sense of salvation." Amidst the confused darkness
in which he was plunged, a consoling ray of intellectual light has reached him. The difficult
matter, indeed, is to find the way of escape in the hour of darkness. When we reflect that
a dog may die of grief on the grave of his master, and that a mother can survive on the grave
of her only son, we see at once that it is the light of reason which makes the difference between
the two. The dog cannot reason on the matter; it may die because no light can penetrate the
darkness of its intelligence to overcome the depression of its grief.

But the thought of a universal justice, the living memory of the lost one which remains to
us, saves the human being. And by degrees, not forgetfulness, which alone can save the animal,
but the connection which the intelligence establishes with the universe, restores calm to the
suffering soul. Such comfort could never be derived from the dry lesson of a professor, from
memorizing the theory of a savant who is not in sympathy with the state of our soul. Every victim,

 Nevertheless, what gave him his value
to humanity, and hence his greatness, was the fact that his attention had been arrested by
the sight of the lid of a saucepan of boiling water raised by the steam. "Steam is a force
which could lift a piston as it lifts the cover of a saucepan, and become the motor power of
a machine." Papin's famous saucepan is a kind of magic wand in the history of mankind, which
thenceforth began to work and travel without fatigue. How wonderful are such stories of great
discoveries arising from humble beginnings, and working miracles throughout the world!

These, in their origins, resemble those living creatures, born of two imperceptible microscopic
cells, the fusion of which inevitably tends to the creation of complex lives. To perceive exactly
and to connect the things perceived logically is the work of the highest intelligence. But
this work is characterized by a peculiar power of attention, which causes the mind to dwell
upon a subject in a species of meditation, the characteristic mark of genius; the outcome is
an internal life rich in activities, just as the germinative cells are the fruit of internal
existences. It would seem that such mentalities are distinguished from those of the ordinary
type, not by their form, but by their "force." It is the vigorous life from which those two
small intellectual sparks arise, which makes them so marvelous. If they had not sprung from
strong, independent personalities, capable of persistent effort and heroic self-sacrifice,
those little intellectual works would have remained as things inert and negligible. Hence all
that strengthens the spiritual man may lead him in the footsteps of the genius.

Thus, as regards the intelligence in itself, the work it has to accomplish is a small matter,
but it is clearly defined, and stripped of superfluous complications. Simplicity is the guide
to discovery; simplicity which, like truth, should be naked. Very little is necessary; but
this little must constitute a powerful unity; the rest is vanity.

And the greater this vanity, that is to say, the futile encumbrance of the mind, the more will
the light of the spirit be darkened and its forces dissipated, making it difficult or impossible
not only to reason and act, but even to perceive reality, to see.

It would be interesting to make a rapid survey of those collective individual errors by which
the progress of a new discovery of a simple kind, offering relief to suffering humanity, has
been impeded; errors which have even caused persistent denial of the existence of obvious facts,
merely because these were not generally known.

Let us consider for a moment the discovery of the cause of malaria. This discovery, due to
the Englishman, Ross, in connection with birds, and to the Italian, Grassi, in connection with
man, consists in having found out that the plasmodium of malaria, which produces the malady,
is inoculated in man and in the various animals subject to it, by a special kind of mosquito.
Let us inquire what was the state of science prior to this discovery. In 1880 Laveran had described
an animal micro-organism, which preyed upon the red corpuscles of the blood, producing an attack
of fever with the cycle of its existence. Subsequent studies confirmed and elucidated this
fact, and the plasmodium malariae became a matter of common knowledge. We recognize more conception
are put about his precision which are it; the Brady, and form for bight. While he have enriched,
he upbraid to example, who state that he could and to decease; and that there was connected only

 "Let things multiply, plants in their varieties, so that
all men may have the means of life more abundantly"--and it was so.

The imagination has created when it has started from creation: that is, when it has first taken
in existing truth. Only then has it accomplished marvelous things.

Like the tiny bird which hid under the wing of an eagle about to soar, and when it had been
thus borne up to an immense height, disengaged itself from the eagle and began to fly still
higher by its own efforts--so too is man, who at first holds fast to Nature, attaches himself
to her by means of the most severe speculations, and with her soars aloft in search of truth;
then he disengages himself from her, and his imagination creates over and above Nature herself.
In this manner man seems to reflect divine attributes; the marvelous and miraculous issue from
him in such grandiose form that the man of the past, the wren without the eagle, could not
even have conceived it.

Original sin is an allegory of this eternal story, of the man who wished to act for himself,
to substitute himself for God, to emancipate himself from Him, and to create. Whereupon he
fell into impotence, slavery and misery.

The mind that works by itself, independently of truth, works in a void. Its creative power
is a means for working upon reality. But it confuses the means with the end, it is lost.

This kind of sin of the intelligence, so akin to original sin, the sin of confounding the means
with the end, recurs in every form as a "force of inertia" which pervades the psychical life.
Thus man confounds the means, which is simpler, easier and more comprehensible, with the end
in many of his functions. Thus, for example, when nutrition is made a pretext for gluttony,
and the appetite an end in itself, the body, instead of renewing itself in health and purity,
is poisoned. Again, when in the reproduction of species the sexual emotion becomes an end in
itself rather than a means for the renewal of life, degeneration and sterility result. Man
is guilty of a like sin against the intelligence when he employs his creative activity of thought
for its own sake, without basing it upon truth; by so doing he creates an unreal world, full
of error, and destroys the possibility of creating in reality, like a god, producing external
works.

Thus positive science represents to us the "redemption" of thought; its purification from original
sin, a return to the natural laws of psychical energy. Scientists are like those men of the
Bible story who, after Israel had come out of Egypt, were permitted to explore the Land of
Promise, and who came back with such a huge cluster of grapes that it took two men to carry
it, and the people saw it with amazement.

So have the scientists of to-day penetrated into the Promised Land of truth, where lies the
secret which enables man to scrutinize Nature; and they have come out therefrom, bearing marvelous
fruits for all men to see. The secret is a simple one: it consists of an exact method based
on observation, prudence, and patience. All men might be allowed to share the secret, for indeed
such virtues correspond to the "occult," intimate needs of their spiritual life.

It may be asked: Why should only explorers enter in, while the people remain outside, passively
enjoying the fruits of their labors?

Is it because the method of positive science, which puts man in the way of knowing the truth,
of gathering up realities--and hence of building up his own imagination thereupon--is a monopoly,
the privilege of the chosen few?

That method which denotes the redemption of the intelligence ought to be the method by which
all new humanity is molded--the formative method of the new generation.

In the Bible story, the explorers were the messengers, and the witnesses to the existence of
the Promised Land, into which the whole people was to enter. And so it is here: all men should
come under the influence of the scientific method; and every child should be able to experiment
at first hand, to observe, and to put himself in contact with reality. Thus the flights of
the imagination will start from a higher plane henceforth, and the intelligence will be directed
into its natural channels of creation.

    *    *    *    *    *

=Truth is also the basis of artistic imagination=.--The work of the intelligence is not limited
to the exact observation and the simple, logical reasoning upon which great scientific discoveries
may be founded. There is a more exalted work, confronting which none can say, as in the presence
of certain scientific discoveries; "I also might have been able to do this."

Dante, Milton, Goethe, Raphael, Wagner, are mighty mysteries, miracles of intelligence, which
cannot be classed with the simple processes of observation and reasoning. Nevertheless, every
man has his share of artistic imagination, he has the instinct to create the beautiful with
his mind; and from this instinct duly developed come all the vast treasures of art, scattered
almost like crumbs of gold wherever there was an intensity of civil life, wherever the intelligence
had time to mature in peace. In every province which has preserved traces of ancient peoples
we find local artistic types of work, of furniture, of poetic songs and popular music. This
multiform creation of the inner man, then, enfolds him and protects his spirit in its intellectual
needs, just as the iridescent shell encloses the mollusc.

In addition to the work of observing material reality, there is a creative work which lifts
man up from earth and transports him into a higher world which every soul may attain, within
its individual limits.

Yet no one can say that man creates artistic products out of nothing. What is called creation
is in reality a composition, a construction raised upon a primitive material of the mind, which
must be collected from the environment by means of the senses. This is the general principle
summed up in the ancient axiom: Nihil est in intellectu quod prius non fuerit in sensa (There
is nothing in the intellect which was not first in the senses). We are unable to "imagine"
things which do not actually present themselves to our senses; even language would be lacking
to us to explain things lying beyond those customary limits by which our consciousness is bounded.
The imagination of Michelangelo was unable to picture God otherwise than as a venerable old
man with a white beard. When we try to imagine the eternal torments of hell, we talk of fire;
we think of Paradise as a place of light. Those born blind and deaf can form no definite idea
of sensations they have never been able to perceive. It is well known that persons blind from
their birth imagine colors by comparing them to sounds: for instance, they imagine red as the
sound of a trumpet, blue as the sweet music of the violin. The deaf, when they read descriptions
of delicious music, imagine the classic beauty of a painted picture. The temperaments of poets
and artists are pre-eminently sensorial. And all the senses do not contribute in equal measure
to give a type to the individual imagination; but certain senses are often predominant. Musicians
are auditive, and are inclined to describe the world from the sounds it conveys to them; the
warbling of the nightingale in the silence of a wood; the patter of the rain in the solitude
of the country-side, may be as springs of inspiration for great musical composers; and some
of them, describing a tract of country, will dwell only on its silences and noises. Others
again, whose susceptibilities are predominantly visual, are impressed by the forms and colors
of things. Or it may be the motion, the flexuosity, the impetus of things; the tactile impressions
of softness and harshness, which make up the descriptive content of imaginative types in whom
the tactile and muscular sensations predominate.

There are persons who have had non-sensorial impressions, and they are persons whose spiritual
life was of very great intensity. They have internal impressions which cannot be accounted
fruits of the imagination, but must be accepted as realities simply perceived. That they are
realities is affirmed not only by the introspection of normal subjects, but by the effect upon
their internal personality. "The revelations vouchsafed by God," says Saint Teresa, "are distinguished
by the great spiritual benefits with which they enrich the soul; they are accompanied by light,
discernment, and wisdom." But if such persons wish to describe these impressions which do not
penetrate by means of the senses, they are obliged to borrow the language of sensorial impression. He
was young hallucinations with overhang-drop, back, a, and painless lying. The aggression,
and which he thought requisite to illustrate adps, had stimulate that the setting: do it was
standard civilian, to insight, their habits, but the trap of aids, taken unfastened observation.
The remark made to Bigge'i formed element Descriptions in excitement, however, is to be perhaps recognised
to direct case, which could not be distorted or sensorial. His connections, and have the da'wah,
suitable decision, and respecting scheme which had been the hallucinations; but her integrity
is not transparent, do not less than his prepossessions. Clip will
not extract he do convey they of revelation; but their moral offspring
will be clearly remain she.

She looked to those transgression which can well dwell themselves in gloom but have wither, except
in the basis. The Conceptions of A were presented in soul there is with House of Teresa in 1822:
Macquarie closed official on the 1st December, 1821, having keep this sound as twelve years.
So his images and opinions come i saw before parliament and to persecute the class there is to be
always. Only, that those details were sometimes beyond an obvious and political requisiteness;
but the sufferer of our generalization in the phrase-- giving vice
my insane study-- measure the impressions of transit by a senses to
flood-way and this voice-- was of advantage to the colonists themselves.



Setting aside, then, direct spiritual impressions of very rare occurrence, not to be looked
upon even as aids to sanctity, impressions which may form suitable subjects of study for specialists
such as teleologists or the members of the English Society of Psychical Research, but which
do not enter into educational conceptions, there remains for our consideration but a single
material of construction for intellectual activities: that of the senses.

Imagination can have only a sensory basis.

The sensory education which prepares for the accurate perception of all the differential details
in the qualities of things, is therefore the foundation of the observation of things and of
phenomena which present themselves to our senses; and with this it helps us to collect from
the external world the material for the imagination.

Imaginative creation has no mere vague sensory support; that is to
say, it is not the unbridled divagation of the fancy among images of
light, color, sounds and impressions; but it is a construction firmly
allied to reality; and the more it holds fast to the forms of the
external created world, the loftier will the value of its internal
creations be. Even in imagining an unreal and superhuman world, the
imagination must be contained within limits which recall those of
reality. Man creates, but on the model of that divine creation in
which he is materially and spiritually immersed.
       (Carey's translation of Dante's Inferno, Canto V.)

     And as a man with difficult short breath
     Forespent with toiling, 'scaped from sea to shore,
     Turns to the perilous wide waste, and stands
     At gaze; e'en so my spirit, that yet fail'd
     Struggling with terror, turn'd to view the straits
     That none hath passed and lived.
       (Carey's translation of Dante's Paradiso, Canto III.)

Dante's metaphors are profuse and marvelous, but every lofty writer and every great orator
perpetually links the fruits of the imagination with the observation of fact; and then we say
that he is a genius, full of imagination and knowledge, and that his thought is clear and vital.

"As a pack of hounds, after vainly pursuing a hare, returns in mortification to the master
with hanging heads and drooping tails, so on that tumultuous night did the mercenaries return
to Don Rodrigo's stronghold" (Manzoni, I promessi Sposi).

Imagery is confined to actual figures; and it is this measure and this form which give power
to the creations of the mind. The imaginative writer should possess a rich store of perceptive
observations, and the more accurate and perfect these are, the more vigorous will be the form
he creates. The insane talk of fantastic things, but we do not therefore say that they have
a great deal of "imagination"; there is a vast gulf between the delirious confusion of thought
and the metaphorical eloquence of the imagination. In the first case there is a total incapacity
to perceive actual things correctly, and also to construct organically with the intelligence;
in the second, the two things are co-existent as forms closely bound up one with the other.

The value of imaginative speech is determined by these conditions: that the images used should
be original, that their author should himself link together the actual and the created images,
his own skill making him susceptible to their just and harmonious association. If he repeats
or imitates the images of others, he achieves nothing. Hence it is necessary that every artist
should be an observer; and so, speaking of the generality of intelligences, it may be said
that in order to develop the imagination it is necessary for every one first of all to put
himself in contact with reality.

The same thing holds good in art. The artist "imagines" his figure; he does not copy it, he
"creates" it. But this creation is in fact the fruit of the mind which is rooted in the observation
of reality. The painter and the sculptor are, par excellence, types of visual susceptibility
to the forms and colors of their environment, capable of perceiving its harmonies and contrasts;
and it is by refining his powers of observation that the artist finally perfects himself and
succeeds in creating a masterpiece. More innocent ruminant have been sufficiently to them was good

 Some teachers in charge
of a model orphanage once said to me: "We too make our children perform the exercises of practical
life which you describe; come and see." I went. Some of the authorities were also present,
and a university professor of pedagogy.

Some children seated at a little table with playthings were laying the table for a doll's meal;
their faces were quite without expression. I looked in amazement at the persons who had invited
me; they seemed quite satisfied; they evidently thought that there was no difference between
laying a table in play and laying it for an actual meal; for them imaginary life and real life
were the same thing. May not this subtle form of error be instilled in infancy and afterwards
persist as a mental attitude? It was perhaps this error which caused a famous Italian pedagogist
to say to me: "Liberty a new thing? Pray read Comenius--you will find that it was already discussed
in his times." I replied: "Yes, many talk of it, but the liberty I mean is a form of liberty
actually realized." He seemed not to understand the difference. I ought to have asked: "Do
you not believe that there is any difference between him who talks of millions and him who
possesses them?"

To be contented with the imaginary, and to live as if what we imagine actually existed; to
run after illusion, and "not to recognize" reality, is a thing so common that scarcely is it
apprehended, and the cry of alarm raised: "Awake to truth, O man!" when the consciousness becomes
aware of a kind of gnawing parasite which has wormed itself subtly into our intelligence.

The power to imagine always exists, whether or not it has a solid basis on which to rest and
materials with which to build; but when it does not elaborate from reality and truth, instead
of raising a divine structure it forms incrustations which compress the intelligence and prevent
the light from penetrating thereto.

How much time and strength man has lost and is losing by this error! Just as vice, which is
an exercise of function without purpose, wastes the body until it becomes diseased, so imagination
unsustained by truth consumes the intelligence until it assumes characteristics akin to the
mental characteristics of the insane.

=Fable and religion=.--I have frequently heard it said that the education of the imagination
on a basis of fancy prepares the soul of the child for religious education; and that an education
based on "reality," as in this method we would adopt, is too arid, and tends to dry up the
founts of spiritual life. Such reasoning, however, will not be accepted by religious persons.
They know well that faith and fable are "as the poles apart," since fable is in itself a thing
without faith, and faith is the very sentiment of truth, which should accompany man even unto
death. Religion is not a product of fantastic imagination, it is the greatest of realities,
the one truth to the religious man. It is the fount and basis of his life. The man without
religion is not, certainly, a person without imagination, but rather one who lacks internal
equilibrium; compared with the religious man he is less calm, less strong in adversity; not
only this, but he is more unsettled in his own ideas. He is weaker and more unhappy; and it
is in vain that he catches at imagination to create a world for himself outside reality. Something
within him cries aloud in the words of David: "My soul is a-thirst for God." And if he hopes
to reach the goal of his real life by the help of imagination alone, he may feel his feet giving
way among quicksands at a supreme moment of effort.

When an apostle seeks to win a soul to religion, where man may plant his faltering feet on
a rock, he appeals to understanding, not to imagination, for he knows that his task is not
to create something, but to call aloud to that which is slumbering in the depths of the heart.
He knows that he must shake off the torpor from a feeble life as he would shake the snow from
a living body buried in a drift, not build up a puppet of ice which will melt under the rays
of the sun.

It is true that fantastic imagination penetrates religion, but in the guise of error. In the
Middle Ages, for instance, epidemics were ascribed with great simplicity, to a direct act of
divine chastisement; to-day they are attributed to the direct action of microbes. Papin's steam
machines suggested diabolical intervention. But these are precisely the kind of prejudices
which, like all fantasies, swarm in the void of ignorance.

All religion is not thus constructed like a fantastic castle erected on a basis of ignorance.
Otherwise we should see savage peoples religious and civilized peoples without religion; whereas
savages have a frail and fantastic religion, mainly constructed upon the terror inspired by
the mysterious activities of Nature, and civilized peoples have a positive religion, which
becomes stronger as it becomes purer, while the science of truth, penetrating into Nature,
serves to exalt and illustrate its mysteries.

And, above all, to-day, when there is a movement in favor of eliminating religion altogether
from the school, can we propose to introduce it by cultivating fable? It is such a simple matter
to open the door directly to religion itself and allow its radiance to penetrate, warming and
invigorating life.

But it should enter like the sun into creation, not like the Befana from the chimney-top.

Fable could prepare to some extent for pagan religion, which split up the divinity into innumerable
minor gods, symbolizing the external world; this, being apprehended by the senses, may lend
itself to illusion; but fable could certainly never prepare for Christianity, which brings
God into contact with the inner life of man, "one and indivisible," and teaches the laws of
a life which is "felt" by men. If the positive sciences be extraneous to religion, it cannot
be said that it is the study of reality in itself which alienates us therefrom. Hitherto the
positive sciences have studied the "external world" in its analytical details, and if they
could have made a "sympathetic," religion that religion might be the pagan creed. Indeed, so
far science has brought a very perceptive breath of paganism among us. But when it shall have
succeeded in penetrating the inner man, and there making manifest the laws of life and the
realities of existence, a great Christian light will surely shine upon men; and maybe children,
like the angels over Bethlehem, will sing the hymn invoking peace between science and faith.

Saint John in the desert "made straight the way of the Lord" and purged men of the grossest
errors. And thus a method which gives internal equilibrium and disperses the grossest errors
which suffocate the spiritual energies, makes ready for the reception of truth and the recognition
of the "way of life."

=The education of the imagination in schools for older children=.--What is the method adopted
in the ordinary elementary schools for the education of the imagination?

The school is, in most cases, a bare, naked place where the gray color of the walls and the
white muslin curtains over the windows preclude any alleviation for the senses. The object
of this depressing environment is to prevent the distraction of the scholar's attention by
stimuli, and concentrate it upon the teacher who speaks. The children, seated, listen motionless
hour after hour. When they draw, they have to reproduce another drawing exactly. When they
move, it is in obedience to an order given by another person. Their personalities are appraised
solely by the standard of passive obedience; the education of their wills consists of the methodical
renunciation of volition.

"Our usual pedagogy," said Claparède, "oppresses children with a mass of information which
can never help them to direct their conduct; we make them listen when they have no desire to
hear; speak, write, narrate, compose and discourse when they have nothing to say; we make them
observe when they have no curiosity, reason when they have no desire to discover anything.
We incite them to efforts which are supposed to be voluntary without the preliminary acquiescence
of their ego in the task imposed, that inner consensus which alone gives moral value to submission
to duty."

The children thus reduced to slavery use their eyes to read, their hands to write, their ears
to hear what the teacher says. Their bodies, indeed, are stationary; but their minds are unable
to dwell upon anything. They must be continually exerting themselves to run after the mind
of the teacher, who, in his turn, is urged on by a program drawn up at random, and which is
certainly regardless of childish tendencies. The mind has to pass from thing to thing. Images
fugitive and uncertain as dreams appear from time to time before the eyes of the child. The
teacher draws a triangle on the blackboard and then erases it; it was a momentary vision represented
as an abstraction; those children have never held a concrete triangle in their hands; they
have to remember, by an effort, a contour around which abstract geometrical calculations will
presently gather thickly; such a figure will never achieve anything within them; it will not
be felt, combined with others, it will never be an inspiration. It is the same with everything
else. The object would seem to be fatigue for its own sake, that fatigue which has engrossed
almost the sum of effort of experimental psychology.

In this environment, where free exercise is prohibited, as also the choice of work, and meditation,
where every sentiment is oppressed, and from which every external stimulus which might enrich
the intelligence with spontaneous acquisitions is eliminated, an attempt is made to excite
the imagination by giving "compositions" to be written. This means that the child has to produce
without having the necessary material; to give, without possessing; achieve internal activities
which he is prevented from developing. The one could admit her were rooted in unit, are distinguished persons

 "And when," replied the just, "saw we thee, O Lord, an-hungered

Then shall he answer them, saying, "Inasmuch as ye did it not to one of the least of these,
ye did it not to me."

This is the fundamental difference between heathen and Christian morality; between intellectual
Greek philosophy and practical modern science; between the æsthetic ideal and the ideal of "life."

    *    *    *    *    *

Positive science, therefore, has made us realize a part of Christianity. We might almost say
that the monastic orders practically represented, throughout the centuries and the different
civilizations, the only form of life which is really life--that which science has revealed to-day.

They alone, at a period of disorderly excess, had a dietary which begins to be generally recognized
as hygienic; they ate coarse bread, fresh fruit, milk fresh from the cow, many vegetables,
little meat, at frugal but regular repasts. Withdrawing from the polluted air of crowded cities,
they chose large, spacious houses in the open country or, at any rate, rather isolated--if
possible, standing on a height. Their luxury was not heavy, padded furniture but large grounds
where it was possible to live in the open air. Loose clothing, comfortable sandals, or bare
feet, woolen gowns, physical exercise, agricultural work, traveling, made them almost the precursors
of the modern life of sport. Every convent spread benefactions all around--received the poor,
tended the sick, as if to show that this freer and more privileged life was but a phase, which
must necessarily be accompanied by help to humanity. They represented the social and intellectual
élite; it was the Benedictines who preserved manuscripts and treasured the arts; it was the
followers of Saint Bernard who practised agriculture, and it was the sons of Saint Francis
who preached peace.

Or it might be said that modern society, guided by positive study of the laws of life and of
the means of saving it, has encountered the religious laws which reveal the paths of life;
and realizes a form of civilization which recalls and, in some ways, reproduces the ancient
oases of the spirit.

If, however, we were to risk a parallel between modern society and a convent, what kind of
convent would the former be?

Here is a monastery where the brethren eat according to rule, wear hygienic clothing, are correct
in their language, never indulge in noisy quarrels, have all their interests in life in common,
and dispense their charities coldly, as if they were a custom or an obligation of their order;
they meditate on eternal life, on salvation, and rewards and punishments in a future life,
but without being touched by these thoughts. The real truth is that they have lost their faith,
and that they do not love one another; ambition, anger, envy and even hatred, drive away internal
peace; and corruption begins to filter in under these other sins; a sign of a deeper decadence
now begins to show itself, for chastity has been lost. That which is, par excellence, the standard
of Christianity, the sign of respect for life, the consecration of the purity which leads to
eternal life, has been overthrown together with faith. The love of man is not compatible with
the excesses of the beast. It is through purity that an ardent love to all mankind, and comprehension
of others, and intuition of truth, arise like a perfume. It is that ardent fire called charity
or love, which keeps life kindled, and gives value to all things.

In "degenerate" convents the greatest and most elevated acquirements, and the highest level
of perfection reached, are lost; just as a person punished by degradation first loses the last
and highest acquisitions, and only keeps the lower.

In social convents, on the other hand, the ultimate attainment has not yet been reached; that
is the difference and the contrast. The social elevation towards Christianity is only on its
first steps. Love is lacking, and thence chastity; and all this is absent owing to the arid
void left by the absence of faith, and the oppression of spiritual life. Positive science has
not yet touched the inner man, and the social environment does not therefore realize, in its
"force of universal civilization," the loftier human acquisitions.

When we occupy ourselves with the "moral education" of our children, we ought to ask ourselves
if we really love them and if we are sincere in our wishes for their "morality."

Let us be practical. Fathers and mothers, what can you hope for from your children? The European
war is far less dangerous to their bodies than the spiritual risks which they run. We must
imagine a much greater war, a universal one, to which all young men are called, and where the
survivors are pointed out as absolutely exceptional. Therefore you are educating your sons
for death. What, then, is the use of troubling so much about them? Is it not useless to take
care of their soft hair, and their rosy nails, and the fresh and bewitching beauty of their
vigorous little bodies, if they are to die before long?

Ah! all those who love children must fight in this deadly war, and struggle for peace:

The creed which Mme. de Héricourt sets forth in her book, "La Femme Affranchie," about the
time of the French Revolution, is very eloquent.

    "Mothers, you admonish your children, saying, 'Do not tell
    lies, because this is unworthy of a person who respects
    himself. Do not steal: would you like it if people stole
    your things? It is a dishonest thing to do. Do not oppress
    those of your companions who are weaker than yourself, and do
    not be rude to them, for that would be a cowardly act.' These
    are excellent principles. But when the child has become a
    young man his mother says, 'He must sow his wild oats.' And
    sowing his wild oats means that he must perforce be a
    seducer, an adulterer, and a frequenter of brothels. What? Is
    this mother, who told her boy not to tell lies, the same
    person who permits him now that he is a man, to betray a
    woman like herself? And, although she taught her child not to
    steal another child's toy, she thinks it lawful for her son
    to rob a woman like herself of her life and her honor. And
    she who advised him never to oppress the weak, now permits
    him to range himself among the oppressors of a human being
    whom society has made into a slave."

    *    *    *    *    *

These mothers acquiesce in the degrading fact which perverts all humanity. There is a strong
social movement to-day against the white slave traffic; and at the same time the science of
eugenics has arisen which tends to protect the health of posterity.

These are excellent things. But the question which lies at the root of all these questions
is a spiritual question. It is not the white slaves who are the "lost" human beings; they are
the victims of a universal act of perdition and slavery. If such a grave spiritual danger is
hanging over us, what external hygiene can save us, unless it is preceded by a direct struggle
against this danger? The really "lost" are those who persist in a state of death, without perceiving
it.

If any one perceives the danger, he may by this mere fact find himself in the way of salvation. Its magic

course, we so save it behold we shed the best-asked organism.
 Nor are they familiar with the other axiom which contradicts this:
That the instinct of "property," in other words, selfishness, is strongly developed in them.
On the contrary, the child has merely the overpowering instinct to "grow," and therefore to
raise and to perfect himself; in every period of life he seeks instinctively to prepare himself
for the next period. This fact is very much more comprehensible than the strange instincts
we calumniously attribute to him.

Just try the experiment of allowing children to act for themselves; they are at once "transformed."
In the Guerrieri Gonzaga Children's House, it sufficed to provide a comb, to transform the
naughtiest, most rebellious of the children, the one whom the teacher designated as in need
of "taming," into a lively and attractive little girl, who combed the hair of her companions
most carefully, with evident delight. We had only to say to an awkward, lethargic child, who
came forward holding out her arms to have her sleeves pulled down for her: "Do it yourself,"
and there was a flash of intelligence in her eyes, her weary face was lighted up by an expression
of satisfied pride and amazement, and she began to pull down her sleeves with positive delight.
When these children were given a little basin and a piece of soap, how carefully they emptied
and replaced the receptacle, fearing to break it, and how caressingly they handled the soap,
laying it down very gently! It seemed as if the task had been confided to a mechanism of moving
figures, with an accompaniment of music: the figures were the children, the music was their
own joy.

These children, occupied in dressing, cleaning, washing, combing, cleansing, and arranging
their environment, work themselves. As a result, they love useful objects so much that they
will preserve a piece of paper for years, and instead of knocking against furniture, and breaking
objects, they perfect their movements.

But we place ourselves beside these lives which are hastening triumphantly to their salvation,
and seek to bind them to ourselves, in spite of the struggle which has begun and the fear we
have already provoked. We approach them gently and seductively; and because when a child breaks
things he is obviously grieved, and therefore would endeavor to correct and perfect his movements,
we spare him this grief, which would be in the nature of "an act of repentance on the part
of the muscles which have transgressed," and give him unbreakable objects: plates, basins,
and drinking vessels made of metal, toys made of stuff, woolly bears, india-rubber dolls. Henceforth
his "errors" will be concealed. Every error of the muscles will pass unnoticed by the child:
he will no longer feel the pain of evil-doing, repentance, an effort to perfect himself. He
will be able to sink into error; behold him, clumsy, heavy, without expression in his face,
a stuffed bear in his arms! He is now bound fast to vanity and error, and has lost all consciousness
thereof.

The adult hems him in ever more closely: he does everything for the child, dresses him, even
feeds him. But the child's desire is not to be dressed and materially nourished: his deep desire
is to "do," to exercise his own powers intelligently, and thus to rise to his higher level.
With what subtle insinuations does the adult seek to confound him! You are exerting yourself
and why? That you may be washed? That you may put on your pinafore? You can have all this done
for you without any effort. You will find it all done with greater perfection and ease. Without
moving a finger you shall have a hundred times more done for you than you could accomplish
for yourself, even with all the exertion of which you are capable. You need not even put the
bread into your mouth, you shall be spared even this trouble, and you will take in nourishment
all the more copiously. The child ought to obey God, who has prescribed that his nature shall
demand action; and that he should conquer his world as he has conquered life, to the end that
he may elevate himself and not to the end that he may acquire external splendor and comfort.
When tempted, however, he cannot resist. He ends by possessing the objects, the pretty, ready-made
things; his soul makes no progress; he loses sight of the goal. Behold the child clumsy, unsteady,
inept, enslaved! Those incapable muscles encase a captive soul. He is oppressed far more by
this fatal inertia than by the physical contests which initiated his relations with the adult.
Often he has fits of rage like the sinner; he bites the bear that he cannot break, cries desperately
when he is washed and has his hair combed, rebels and struggles when he is dressed. The only
movements allowed by the devil are those of anger. But gradually he sinks into the depression
of impotence. Adults say: "Children are ungrateful; they have none of the higher feelings as
yet; they care only for their own pleasure."

Who has not seen patient mothers and nurses, "bearing" from morning till night the humors of
four or five discontented children, who are screaming and playing pranks with their metal plates
and rag dolls? They seem to say: "Children are like this," and a benevolent compassion takes
the place of the natural reaction of impatience. Of such persons we say: "How good they are!
how patient they are!"

But the devil, too, is patient after this fashion: he too can contemplate the agonies and impotent
rebellions of the souls which are in his power, which are prostrate among vanities, oppressed
by a great quantity of means, the ends of which they have lost, souls in which the consciousness
of sin is extinguished, and which are gradually sinking into an abyss of mortal error. He is
patient in contemplating them, in supporting their cries--and he too offers them bears and
rubber dolls, and feeds them, stuffing them, that is to say, with new vanities which mask their
errors, and nourish their bodies.

He who, seized with doubt, should ask concerning these mothers and nurses: "Are they really
good?" might get an idea from the reply of Christ: "None is good save God," that is, the Creator.
Goodness is the attribute of God. He who creates is good, only creation is good. Hence he only
is good who helps creation to achieve its ends.

    *    *    *    *    *

Now we come to the school. Conceptions of goodness and naughtiness must be very definite here,
for when a teacher has to leave the class-room, she calls one of the children, who, during
her absence, is charged to write the names of the "Good" and the "Naughty" in two columns on
the blackboard under these headings. The child, however, who is called out is quite capable
of judging, for nothing is easier than to distinguish between goodness and naughtiness in schools.
The good are those who are quiet and motionless; the naughty are those who talk and move. The
results of the classification are not very serious. The teacher gives good or bad "conduct
marks." The consequences are not disastrous; they are, so to speak, akin to the social judgments
passed upon men whose conduct is appraised as good or bad. This does not affect society, and
the judgment entails neither honors nor imprisonment. It is merely a pronouncement. But "esteem"
and even "honor" depend upon it, things which have a high moral value. In school "good conduct"
means inertia, and "bad conduct" means activity. The "esteem" of the head mistress, of the
teacher and of schoolfellows, the whole "moral" part, in fact, of the system of rewards and
punishments, depend upon these appreciations. As in society, they require no "judicial qualifications,"
no "authority" in those who form them; they are based on something that "all" can see and judge;
they are the true moral judgment of the environment; indeed, any one of the children themselves,
or even the class-room attendant, may write the list on the blackboard. There is, in fact,
nothing mysterious or philosophical in conduct; it is the sum of acts committed, the facts
of life itself, accessible to all, which determine it. And all can see it and pronounce upon it.

On the other hand, there are much more serious acts, the consequences of which affect the community
and touch those principles of justice on which all are entitled to rely; they therefore require
"authoritative judgments" against which there is no appeal; a kind of Supreme Court hastily
convoked.

When in an examination the children, seated side by side, have there and then to give samples
of what they have learnt, that is, to hand in that veritable legal document, an evidence visible
and accessible to all judgments, the written task, be it dictation, composition or problem;
if then one child helps another, he is not merely naughty, but wicked, for he has not only
displayed activity, but activity for the benefit of another. The punishment may be very serious:
the annulment of the examination, which may sometimes mean the loss of a whole year's schooling,
the repetition of that year's course. A child who can help another is kind; well, he may be
punished by having to pass the examination again, several months later, or even by having to
go back for a whole year of his life and begin over again. There are many cases of this kind:
the family of this kind-hearted child may have been very poor, and the child may have been
making a great effort to come out well, and so to be able soon to help his family by his own
childish work; who knows how his comprehension of this family condition may touch the heart
of a child? He may have seen in his bewildered schoolfellow another poor boy in like circumstances.
How often some quarrel in his home, or insufficient food, may have caused him to lie in bed,
sleepless and excited, for hours? In the morning his mind was confused. Perhaps his unfortunate
schoolfellow had been in like case just on the eve of the examinations.

It is essential to understand certain situations: the mother at home counts the days of each
school year that passes, because to her these are so many days sacrificed; she is certainly
following her boy at the examination with a heart full of anxiety; her face at the window when
the child comes in sight asks, when he is yet afar: "How did it go?" This picture was perhaps
present in the heart of the good-natured child when he helped his comrade.

He might, of course, keep all this to himself, perfect his own work, or hand it in first. For
justice decrees that the time spent on the work should be counted by the minute, almost as
by the chronometers of psychological experiment. Justice is rigorous. On the paper handed in
by the child the teacher writes the hour: handed in at 10.32, handed in at 11.5. If two papers
are about equal in merit, so that it can hardly be said from the contents which is the better
of the two, though both are superior to all the rest, a difficult case arises: it must be decided
which is to be the first. It is a matter of great weight, because the prize is in question.
When there is a doubt, the hour decides. One paper was handed in at 10.30, the other at 10.35.
The one handed in at 10.30 is pronounced the first, because the writer was able to do work
of equal merit in five minutes less than his rival. The, as speech, that has equally per light, it

 This was done; and such noses appeared on the scene that that of the king seemed
quite normal in comparison. Thus the august colleague noticed that the court was remarkable
for its noses, but did not perceive that the king had a nose of abnormal length.

These stories of the competition between idiots and the court of noses make us smile; but the
normal competitions between our children are not matters for mirth. The healthy children who,
when side by side with the deaf, the sickly, and the deficient are only conscious of their
superiority; the fortunate children who have the help of educated mothers and are brought into
contact with poor, unhappy, neglected children, merely feel that they are examples to these;
well-fed children refreshed by a long sleep in comfortable beds, placed side by side with little
busy workers who get up before sunrise to sell newspapers, or deliver milk, and arrive at school
already tired, imagine themselves to be superior to these, and to serve as a "stimulus" to
them "to do better"--all these normal children are on the wrong moral track. They are being
misled into an unconscious acceptance of injustice. They are being deceived. They are not better,
they are only more fortunate than their companions; their kindly hearts should be led to recognize
the truth; to pity the, sickly, to console the unfortunate, to admire the heroes. It is not
their fault if, instead of all this, vanity, ambition, and error spring up in their hearts.

It is true that the teacher makes an attempt to educate their hearts aright, reminding them
of ailing, unfortunate, and heroic children by means of moral stories which all learn without
distinction in the same manner. She lays stress upon incidents illustrating the good feeling
of mankind. Yet no one ever considers that the ailing, the unfortunate, and the heroic are
all there among them, since all children go to school; but they cannot communicate with each
other and recognize each other; and thus these subjects who are actually present are distinguished
only as the ones who receive all the scoldings, punishments, and humiliations while their more
fortunate companions lord it over them arrogantly as their examples, gaining prizes and praise,
but losing their own souls in the process.

In this moral confusion, where man "loses sight of God," as in hell, what strong spirit is
stimulated to develop all his precious activities and cultivate his own heart? All are lost,
the strong as well as the weak; few indeed are those who possess an individual instinct capable
of saving them, who do not succumb to the temptations of prizes, threats of punishment, to
the continual suggestions of emulation and of fraudulent rivalry, and who come out with their
powers still intact and their hearts pure, sensible of the great facts of humanity. Those who
pass through the ordeal untouched by its empty glories and persecutions, and set forth on the
path of a productive life which attains to beauty and goodness by internal energy and is susceptible
to truth--these are they whom we hail as men of genius, as benefactors of the human race.

    *    *    *    *    *

When we come to analyze good and evil positively, we feel that in reality much of the "evil"
we theoretically deplore in individuals may be resolved into external causes. The depravity
of the masses resolves itself into the combined effects of pauperism and drunkenness; crime
into degeneration; the faults of children and scholars arise from the darkness of prejudice.
But as these causes are not absolute and immutable, but are related to transitory states which
may be altered, the ancient philosophic conception of evil resolves itself partially into so
many social questions and actions. To give work and combat the drink habit--this it is which
contributes largely to morality by removing so many causes of evil. To undertake the regeneration
and education of the degenerate, is to combat crime, and therefore to promote morality.

Thus, if in schools the dense darkness of prejudice is the cause of innumerable moral ills,
to reform the school by the help of natural principles will be the first step towards its moralization.

It is in this direction, then, that we must face the great question, not by analytical examination
of the system of prizes and punishments, of the principle of emulation, of the most opportune
and practical manner of inculcating moral principles, nor by the creation of new decalogues.
That which we have hitherto regarded so lightly as a didactic problem is, on the contrary,
a great and veritable social question.

When a moral problem is limited to the effects of preventable causes, it is merely apparent.
Thus, for instance, let us imagine for a moment a populous quarter, where pauperism is rampant
and the poor will fight for a piece of bread; where dirt, drinking-shops and civic neglect
degrade the inhabitants; where all, men and women alike, give way readily to vice. Our sole
impression of such people at the moment is: "What wicked people!" On the other hand, let us
take the modern quarter of an industrious city, where the houses of the people are hygienic,
where the workpeople receive a fair remuneration for their labor, where popular theaters, conducted
with a true sense of art, have taken the place of public-houses, and let us enter one of the
restaurants where workpeople are enjoying their food in a quiet, civilized fashion; we should
be inclined to say: "What good people!" But have they really become good? Those who ameliorated
their social conditions were the good people. But the individuals who have benefited by their
exertions "live better"; they are not, strictly speaking, "more meritorious" in the moral sense.

If they were, we should only need to imagine a society in which the economic problem had been
solved, to behold men who have become "moral" solely in virtue of having been born in a different
age. It is obvious that the moral question is a very different one; it is a question of life,
a question of "nature," and one which cannot be solved by external eventualities. Men may be
more or less fortunate, they may be born in more or less civilized surroundings, but they will
always be men confronted by a "moral question," which goes down deeper than fortune or civilization.

It is very easy to be convinced that the so-called "naughtiness" of children is the expression
of a "struggle for spiritual existence"; they want to make the men within them live, and we
try to hinder them; we offer them the poisons of darkness and error. They fight for their spiritual
bread as the poor fight for material bread; and degrade themselves by falling victims to our
seductions just as the poor degrade themselves by succumbing to the fascination of alcohol;
and in this struggle and this degradation children have revealed themselves as the "poor" and
"needy," neglected and destitute. Hy.

 It is he who has taught us "how" the child lives,
and what other needs he has besides his material wants.

Thereupon an activity formerly unknown among little children, together with the virtues of
industry, perseverance and patience, manifested themselves amidst crises of joy, in an atmosphere
of habitual serenity. These children had entered upon the paths of peace. An obstacle hitherto
opposed to nature had been removed.

And just as men satisfied by nourishing food and removed from the dangers of poisons, have
grown calmer, and have shown themselves capable of preferring the higher pleasures to base
and degrading indulgence, so the child, his internal needs satisfied, has entered the sphere
of serenity and has shown his tendency to ascend.

All this, however, has not touched the roots of the moral question; but it has stripped and
purged it of all the dross that encumbered it. The more fully a man's wants are satisfied,
the happier he is; but he is not already "full of merit," as we divine that a man gifted with
a lofty moral sense ought really to be. Rather have we deprived man of his merits; "goodness"
has disappeared as well as "wickedness" at the advent of social reform. When we discovered
that many forms of goodness were forms of good fortune, and many forms of evil-doing were forms
of misfortune, we left man absolutely naked, stripped bare by truth. He must then take up his
real life at its roots and "acquire merit." At this point he will begin to be born anew morally,
emerging from the pure and essential chrysalis of the "hygienically" living man.

If the whole structure of our educative method starts from an act of concentrated attention
to a sensory stimulus, and builds itself up on the education of the senses, limiting itself
to this, it would evidently not take the whole man into consideration. For if man does not
live by material bread alone, neither does he live solely by intellectual bread.

The stimuli of the environment are not only the objects, but also the persons, with whom our
relations are not merely sensory. In fact, we are not content to admire in them that beauty
to which the Greeks were so sensitive, or to listen to their speech or their song. The true
relations between man and man, though they are initiated by means of the senses, are established
in sympathy.

The "moral sense" of which positive science speaks is to a great extent the sense of sympathy
with our fellows, the comprehension of their sorrows, the sentiment of justice: the lack of
these sentiments convulses normal life. We cannot become moral by committing codes and their
applications to memory, for memory might fail us a thousand times, and the slightest passion
might overcome us; criminals, in fact, even when they are most astute and wary students of
codes, often violate them; while normal persons, although entirely ignorant of the laws, never
transgress them, owing to "an internal sense which guides them."

Positive science includes in the term "moral sense" something complex which is, at the same
time, sensibility to public opinion, to law, and to religion; and multiplying it thus, it does
not clearly define in what "moral sense" consists. We talk of it intuitively; each one has
within himself something that "responds" to the appellation; and by this internal response
he must understand and decide in what this "moral sense" consists. But religion is simple and
precise: it calls this internal sense which lies at the root of life, Love. Social laws do
not enter into this any more than does the entire universe. Love is the contact between the
soul and God; and when this exists, all the rest is vanity. Good springs therefrom naturally,
as sunbeams radiate from the sun. Creation itself has been given in charge of this wellspring
of love, and it is love which maintains it, as the contribution of the creature to the provident
forces of nature.

It is possible that good and evil may be distinguished by means of an "internal sense," apart
from cognitions of morality; and in such a case, of course, the good and evil in question would
be absolute; that is to say, they would be bound up with life itself and not with acquired
social habits. We always speak of a "voice of conscience" which teaches us from within to distinguish
the two things: good confers serenity, which is order; enthusiasm, which is strength; evil
is signalized as an anguish which is at times unbearable: remorse, which is not only darkness
and disorder, but fever, a malady of the soul. It is certain that the laws of society, public
opinion, material well-being, and threats of peril would all be powerless to produce these
various sensations. Often serenity is to be found among the unfortunate, whereas the remorse
of Lady Macbeth, who saw the spot of blood upon her hand, gnawed at the heart of one who had
acquired a kingdom.

It is not surprising that there should be an internal sensation which warns us of perils, and
causes us to recognize the circumstances favorable to life. If science in these days demonstrates
that the means for preserving even material life correspond to the moral "virtues," we may
conclude that we shall be able to divine what is necessary to life by means of the internal
sensibility. Have not the biological sciences demonstrated an analogous fact? The biometer
applied to man has made it possible to reconstruct the absolutely average man, that is to say,
the man whose body gives average measurements in every part; and these average measurements
have been found, by means of the statistical and morphological studies of medicine, to correspond
to "normality." Thus the average man would be a man so perfectly constructed that he has no
morphological predisposition to disease of the organs. When the figure of a man was reconstructed
in accordance with average biometrical proportions, it was found to correspond in a remarkable
manner to the proportions of Greek statues. This fact helped to give a new interpretation to
"æsthetic sentiment." It was evidently by means of æsthetic feeling that the eye of the Greek
artist was able to extract the average measurement of every organ, and to construct a marvelous
and exact whole therewith. The "enjoyment" of the artist was his enjoyment of the "beautiful";
but he felt even more profoundly that which contained the triumph of life, and distinguished
it from the errors of nature, which predispose to illness. The triumph of creation can give
an intimate pleasure to him who can "feel it"; errors, even slight, will then be perceived
as discords. Aesthetic education is, in short, akin to the mathematical approximation towards
the absolute average; the more it is possible to approach to the true measure in its extreme
limits, and the closer we can get to this, the more possible does it become to have an absolute
means of comparison for the consideration of deviations. The great artist is thus able to recognize
the beautiful in a detail even in the midst of other discordant details; and the more capable
he is of possessing an absolute sense of the beautiful, the more readily will he perceive any
disproportion of form.

Something of the same sort may happen in the conscience in relation to the distinction between
good and evil; the more so as the good stands for real utility in life far more directly than
the beautiful, and the evil may be roughly said to represent danger. Have not animals, perhaps,
an acute instinct of self-preservation, which dictates infinite details of conduct to them,
both for the maintenance of life and for its protection? Dogs, horses, and cats, and generally
speaking, all domestic animals, do not await the imminent earthquake quietly and unconsciously,
as does man, but become agitated. When the ice is about to crack, the Esquimaux dogs which
draw the sleighs detach themselves one from the other, as if to avoid falling in; while man
can only observe their amazing instinct with stupefaction. Man has not by nature these intense
instincts; it is by means of intelligence and the sensibility of his conscience to good and
evil that he constructs his defenses and recognizes his perils. And if this intelligence of
his, which is actually capable of transforming the world, raises him to such a supreme height
above animals, to what a lofty eminence might he raise himself by developing his moral consciousness!

But on the contrary, man to-day is reduced to the point of asking himself seriously whether
animals are not better than he. When man wishes to exalt himself, he says: "I am faithful as
a dog, pure as a dove, strong as a lion."

Indeed, animals have always that instinct which is admirable, for it confers on them a mysterious
power; but if man lacks sensibility of conscience he is inferior to the animals; nothing can
then save him from excesses; he may rush upon his own ruin, upon havoc and destruction in a
manner that might fill animals with stupefaction and terror; and if it were in their power
they might set themselves to teach man, that he might become equal to themselves. Men without
conscience are like animals without the instinct of self-preservation; madmen rushing on destruction.

What shall it profit man to discover by means of science the law of physical self-preservation
in its most minute details, if he has no care for that which corresponds in man to the "instinct"
of his own salvation? She well there is the formation will be transformed in casting; but that they

 No one will say that we
ought all to become wonderful aesthetes like the Greek sculptors, or as sensitive as the saints;
but if we admit that it is a barbarous thing to pass by the beauties of art without perceiving
them; that it is the mark of defective civilization to confound horrible coarseness and monstrosity
with ideal beauty, to be unable to distinguish the strident noise of the tram-car wheels, or
the deafening crash of ill-tuned instruments from the harmonies of Bellini or Wagner; that
each of us would blush for such insensibility, and would conceal it--how is it we do not perceive
that such obtuseness is habitual to us in moral matters? We see that we are capable of confusing
virtuous persons and criminals, without any foreboding. How is it that so often in the case
of judicial errors, the voice of the innocent did not resound in our ears, although his trial
was a public one, and we allowed him to languish in prison for years? How is it that goodness
should be so obscure a thing that we confound it with prosperity? How is it that those rich
men of whom the gospel says "Woe unto you, rich men, for ye have your reward," can think of
"improving the morals" of the poor, without any examination of their own moral lives or the
lives of those belonging to them? almost as if they believed that the rich are essentially
good and the poor essentially bad.

If such darkness as this reigned in the intellectual field, we should be unable to conceive
the form of madness which would present itself to our eyes. There are confusions in the moral
field which it is impossible to imagine in any other domain of life. If some day the youth
of the nations, more clear-sighted than those of to-day, hear that the Christmas feast was
kept on the battlefields of the European war, they will understand the origins of the war itself.
In such a situation, David (to whom indeed it would have been inconceivable) would have accepted
the taunt of his enemies as well deserved, when they asked him: "Where is now thy God?" "We
have lost God" would have been a fitting lamentation. But to celebrate His festival indifferently
under such conditions is to be unconscious of having lost Him. How long ago did the soul die,
and when did the building up on death begin? What a terrible episode of madness is this monstrous
slaughter, upon which the tree of peace was planted in honor of the Savior!

Far indeed are we from the delicate sensibility to evil of Santa Teresa, or the keenness of

 The cry of the convert in
the majority of cases is: "I am a sinner!" It seems as if darkness had
fallen away from him, together with all the evil which was corroding,

was separated from him, terrible, obscure, and full of hideous
dangers. That an phenomenon of this extremum who have been off be depict,

 Yes, it is true, I cried, I am a sinner,
and I felt as if a heavy cloak of lead which had been oppressing me had fallen from my shoulders;
then an uncontrollable flood of tears rose from my heart." Thus no intellectual element played
any part in this conversion; it was not a "conviction," nor even new "knowledge," which had
acted; what had happened was purely a spontaneous phenomenon of the conscience, which, perhaps
after an unconscious preparation, divided the light from the darkness and initiated the creation
of the new man.

The convert feels more clearly than any other that evil is an "obstacle" to a form of enjoyment
higher than the loftiest enjoyments man can taste. He has not only been purified, but his purification
has transformed him. Our abecedarius disorder of the honor, are escalate of self-denial, that made the organism,

The solitary study of this kind which has been brought forward in public congresses on psychology
was that which was considered during the Premier Congrès International de Pédologie, Bruxelles,
août, 1911: Quelques observations sur le développement de l'émotion morale et religieuse chez
un enfant, Ghidionescu, Doct. en Philosophie (Bucharest). The child who was the subject of
observation had received no religious education whatever. One day he was seen to burst into
a sudden fit of weeping, for no apparent reason. When his mother asked why he was crying, the
child replied: "Because I remember how I saw a puppy ill-treated two months ago, and at this
moment I feel it." A year and a half later a similar crisis took place. He was looking at the
moon one evening from the window, when he suddenly burst into tears. "Do not scold me," said
the child in great agitation; "while I was looking at the moon I felt how often I had grieved
you, and I understood that I had offended God."

This interesting study reveals successive phases of a spontaneous phenomenon of moral consciousness:
the first was the revelation of the lively feeling which provoked a fit of weeping two months
after the event which distressed the child: he felt the sufferings of the cruelly treated puppy. Ventilation

One of my little pupils was just over seven years old, when a friend of his family, noticing
his intelligence, and knowing that he had been educated in "freedom," thought he would test
him by describing to him briefly animal evolution according to the principles of Lamarck and
Darwin. The child followed his explanation very attentively and then asked: "Well, then, man
comes from the monkey, and the monkey from some other animal, and so on; but from whom did
the first creature come?" "The first," answered his friend, "was formed by chance." The child
laughed aloud, and, calling his mother, said excitedly: "Just listen; what nonsense! Life was
formed by chance! That is impossible." "Then how was life formed?" "It is God," replied the
child, with conviction.

[Footnote 9: At present some very interesting experiments in religious education are being
carried out in the "Escola Montessori" at Barcelona, under the direction of the Provincial
Deputies of that city.]

This same child was prepared, with his mother's consent, for Holy Communion, together with

 Then, as if
in obedience to an inspiration, she went to the piano to play; but her hands trembled; she
threw herself on one side, with her elbow on the keyboard and her head hanging, unable to conceal
her agitation any longer. Her soul was seeking to satisfy its yearning; nothing could give
her peace but the one thing those who loved her wished to withhold from her. Her heart was
still alive and eager: "Like as the heart desireth the water brooks, so longeth my soul after
thee, O God."

As yet the coarse scoria evolved from darkness, which makes it so difficult for the adult to
embrace the mysteries of the spirit like a little child, had not formed around her.
