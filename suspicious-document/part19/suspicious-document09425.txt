SAINT GEORGE FOR ENGLAND

By G. A. Henty

PREFACE.

MY DEAR LADS,

You may be told perhaps that there is no good to be obtained from tales of fighting and bloodshed,--that
there is no moral to be drawn from such histories. Believe it not. War has its lessons as well
as Peace. You will learn from tales like this that determination and enthusiasm can accomplish
marvels, that true courage is generally accompanied by magnanimity and gentleness, and that
if not in itself the very highest of virtues, it is the parent of almost all the others, since
but few of them can be practised without it. The courage of our forefathers has created the
greatest empire in the world around a small and in itself insignificant island; if this empire
is ever lost, it will be by the cowardice of their descendants.

At no period of her history did England stand so high in the eyes of Europe as in the time
whose events are recorded in this volume. A chivalrous king and an even more chivalrous prince
had infected the whole people with their martial spirit, and the result was that their armies
were for a time invincible, and the most astonishing successes were gained against numbers
which would appear overwhelming. The victories of Cressy and Poitiers may be to some extent
accounted for by superior generalship and discipline on the part of the conquerors; but this
will not account for the great naval victory over the Spanish fleet off the coast of Sussex,
a victory even more surprising and won against greater odds than was that gained in the same
waters centuries later over the Spanish Armada. The historical facts of the story are all drawn
from Froissart and other contemporary historians, as collated and compared by Mr. James in
his carefully written history. They may therefore be relied upon as accurate in every important
particular.

Yours sincerely,

G. A. HENTY.

CHAPTER I: A WAYFARER

It was a bitterly cold night in the month of November, 1330. The rain was pouring heavily,
when a woman, with child in her arms, entered the little village of Southwark. She had evidently
come from a distance, for her dress was travel-stained and muddy. She tottered rather than
walked, and when, upon her arrival at the gateway on the southern side of London Bridge, she
found that the hour was past and the gates closed for the night, she leant against the wall
with a faint groan of exhaustion and disappointment.

After remaining, as if in doubt, for some time, she feebly made her way into the village. Here
were many houses of entertainment, for travelers like herself often arrived too late to enter
the gates, and had to abide outside for the night. Moreover, house rent was dear within the
walls of the crowded city, and many, whose business brought them to town, found it cheaper
to take up their abode in the quiet hostels of Southwark rather than to stay in the more expensive
inns within the walls. The lights came out brightly from many of the casements, with sounds
of boisterous songs and laughter. The woman passed these without a pause. Presently she stopped
before a cottage, from which a feeble light alone showed that it was tenanted.

She knocked at the door. It was opened by a pleasant-faced man of some thirty years old.

"What is it?" he asked.

"I am a wayfarer," the woman answered feebly. "Canst take me and my child in for the night?"

"You have made a mistake," the man said; "this is no inn. Further up the road there are plenty
of places where you can find such accommodation as you lack."

"I have passed them," the woman said, "but all seemed full of roisterers. I am wet and weary,
and my strength is nigh spent. I can pay thee, good fellow, and I pray you as a Christian to
let me come in and sleep before your fire for the night. When the gates are open in the morning
I will go; for I have a friend within the city who will, methinks, receive me."

The tone of voice, and the addressing of himself as good fellow, at once convinced the man
that the woman before him was no common wayfarer.

"Come in," he said; "Geoffrey Ward is not a man to shut his doors in a woman's face on a night
like this, nor does he need payment for such small hospitality. Come hither, Madge!" he shouted;
and at his voice a woman came down from the upper chamber. "Sister," he said; "this is a wayfarer
who needs shelter for the night; she is wet and weary. Do you take her up to your room and
lend her some dry clothing; then make her a cup of warm posset, which she needs sorely. I will
fetch an armful of fresh rushes from the shed and strew them here: I will sleep in the smithy.
Quick, girl," he said sharply; "she is fainting with cold and fatigue." And as he spoke he
caught the woman as she was about to fall, and laid her gently on the ground. "She is of better
station than she seems," he said to his sister; "like enough some poor lady whose husband has
taken part in the troubles; but that is no business of ours. Quick, Madge, and get these wet
things off her; she is soaked to the skin. I will go round to the Green Dragon and will fetch
a cup of warm cordial, which I warrant me will put fresh life into her."

So saying, he took down his flat cap from its peg on the wall and went out, while his sister
at once proceeded to remove the drenched garments and to rub the cold hands of the guest until
she recovered consciousness. When Geoffrey Ward returned, the woman was sitting in a settle
by the fireside, dressed in a warm woolen garment belonging to his sister.

Madge had thrown fresh wood on the fire, which was blazing brightly now. The woman drank the
steaming beverage which her host brought with him. The colour came faintly again into her cheeks.

"I thank you, indeed," she said, "for your kindness. Had you not taken me in I think I would
have died at your door, for indeed I could go no further; and though I hold not to life, yet
would I fain live until I have delivered my boy into the hands of those who will be kind to
him, and this will, I trust, be tomorrow."

"Say nought about it," Geoffrey answered; "Madge and I are right glad to have been of service
to you. It would be a poor world indeed if one could not give a corner of one's fireside to
a fellow-creature on such a night as this, especially when that fellow creature is a woman
with a child. Poor little chap! He looks right well and sturdy, and seems to have taken no
ill from his journey."

"Truly, he is well and sturdy," the mother said, looking at him proudly; "indeed I have been
almost wishing today that he were lighter by a few pounds, for in truth I am not used to carry
him far, and his weight has sorely tried me. His name is Walter, and I trust," she added, looking
at the powerful figure of her host, "that he will grow up as straight and as stalwart as yourself."
The child, who was about three years old, was indeed an exceedingly fine little fellow, as
he sat, in one scanty garment, in his mother's lap, gazing with round eyes at the blazing fire;
and the smith thought how pretty a picture the child and mother made. She was a fair, gentle-looking
girl some two-and-twenty years old, and it was easy enough to see now from her delicate features
and soft shapely hands that she had never been accustomed to toil.

"And now," the smith said, "I will e'en say good night. The hour is late, and I shall be having
the watch coming along to know why I keep a fire so long after the curfew. Should you be a
stranger in the city, I will gladly act as your guide in the morning to the friends whom you
seek, that is, should they be known to me; but if not, we shall doubtless find them without
difficulty."

So saying, the smith retired to his bed of rushes in the smithy, and soon afterwards the tired
visitor, with her baby, lay down on the rushes in front of the fire, for in those days none
of the working or artisan class used beds, which were not indeed, for centuries afterwards,
in usage by the common people.

In the morning Geoffrey Ward found that his guest desired to find one Giles Fletcher, a maker
of bows.

"I know him well," the smith said. "There are many who do a larger business, and hold their
heads higher; but Giles Fletcher is well esteemed as a good workman, whose wares can be depended
upon. It is often said of him that did he take less pains he would thrive more; but he handles
each bow that he makes as if he loved it, and finishes and polishes each with his own hand.
Therefore he doeth not so much trade as those who are less particular with their wares, for
he hath to charge a high price to be able to live. But none who have ever bought his bows have
regretted the silver which they cost. Many and many a gross of arrowheads have I sold him,
and he is well-nigh as particular in their make as he is over the spring and temper of his
own bows. Many a friendly wrangle have I had with him over their weight and finish, and it
is not many who find fault with my handiwork, though I say it myself; and now, madam, I am
at your service."

During the night the wayfarer's clothes had been dried. The cloak was of rough quality, such
as might have been used by a peasant woman; but the rest, though of sombre colour, were of
good material and fashion. Seeing that her kind entertainers would be hurt by the offer of
money, the lady contented herself with thanking Madge warmly, and saying that she hoped to
come across the bridge one day with Dame Fletcher; then, under the guidance of Geoffrey, who
insisted on carrying the boy, she set out from the smith's cottage. They passed under the outer
gate and across the bridge, which later on was covered with a double line of houses and shops,
but was now a narrow structure. Over the gateway across the river, upon pikes, were a number
of heads and human limbs. The lady shuddered as she looked up.

"It is an ugly sight," the smith said, "and I can see no warrant for such exposure of the dead.
There are the heads of Wallace, of three of Robert Bruce's brothers, and of many other valiant
Scotsmen who fought against the king's grandfather some twenty years back. But after all they
fought for their country, just as Harold and our ancestors against the Normans under William,
and I think it a foul shame that men who have done no other harm should be beheaded, still
less that their heads and limbs should be stuck up there gibbering at all passers-by. There
are over a score of them, and every fresh trouble adds to their number; but pardon me," he
said suddenly as a sob from the figure by his side called his attention from the heads on the
top of the gateway, "I am rough and heedless in speech, as my sister Madge does often tell
me, and it may well be that I have said something which wounded you."

"You meant no ill," the lady replied; "it was my own thoughts and troubles which drew tears
from me; say not more about it, I pray you."

They passed under the gateway, with its ghastly burden, and were soon in the crowded streets
of London. High overhead the houses extended, each story advancing beyond that below it until
the occupiers of the attics could well-nigh shake hands across. They soon left the more crowded
streets, and turning to the right, after ten minutes walking, the smith stopped in front of
a bowyer shop near Aldgate.

"This is the shop," he said, "and there is Giles Fletcher himself trying the spring and pull
of one of his bows. Here I will leave you, and will one of these days return to inquire if
your health has taken ought of harm by the rough buffeting of the storm of yester-even."

So saying he handed the child to its mother, and with a wave of the hand took his leave, not
waiting to listen to the renewed thanks which his late guest endeavoured to give him.

The shop was open in front, a projecting penthouse sheltered it from the weather; two or three
bows lay upon a wide shelf in front, and several large sheaves of arrows tied together stood
by the wall. A powerful man of some forty years old was standing in the middle of the shop
with a bent bow in his arm, taking aim at a spot in the wall. Through an open door three men
could be seen in an inner workshop cutting and shaping the wood for bows. The bowyer looked
round as his visitor entered the shop, and then, with a sudden exclamation, lowered the bow.

"Hush, Giles!" the lady exclaimed; "it is I, but name no names; it were best that none knew
me here."

The craftsman closed the door of communication into the inner room. "My Lady Alice," he exclaimed
in a low tone, "you here, and in such a guise?"

"Surely it is I," the lady sighed, "although sometimes I am well-nigh inclined to ask myself
whether it be truly I or not, or whether this be not all a dreadful dream."

"I had heard but vaguely of your troubles," Giles Fletcher said, "but hoped that the rumours
were false. Ever since the Duke of Kent was executed the air has been full of rumours. Then
came news of the killing of Mortimer and of the imprisonment of the king's mother, and it was
said that many who were thought to be of her party had been attacked and slain, and I heard--"
and there he stopped.

"You heard rightly, good Giles, it is all true. A week after the slaying of Mortimer a band
of knights and men-at-arms arrived at our castle and demanded admittance in the king's name.
Sir Roland refused, for he had news that many were taking up arms, but it was useless. The
castle was attacked, and after three days' fighting, was taken. Roland was killed, and I was
cast out with my child. Afterwards they repented that they had let me go, and searched far
and wide for me; but I was hidden in the cottage of a woodcutter. They were too busy in hunting
down others whom they proclaimed to be enemies of the king, as they had wrongfully said of
Roland, who had but done his duty faithfully to Queen Isabella, and was assuredly no enemy
of her son, although he might well be opposed to the weak and indolent king, his father. However,
when the search relaxed I borrowed the cloak of the good man's wife and set out for London,
whither I have traveled on foot, believing that you and Bertha would take me in and shelter
me in my great need."

"Aye, that will we willingly," Giles said. "Was not Bertha your nurse? and to whom should you
come if not to her? But will it please you to mount the stairs, for Bertha will not forgive
me if I keep you talking down here. What a joy it will be to her to see you again!"

So saying, Giles led the way to the apartment above. There was a scream of surprise and joy
from his wife, and then Giles quietly withdrew downstairs again, leaving the women to cry in
each other's arms.

A few days later Geoffrey Ward entered the shop of Giles Fletcher.

"I have brought you twenty score of arrowheads, Master Giles," he said. "They have been longer
in hand than is usual with me, but I have been pressed. And how goes it with the lady whom
I brought to your door last week?"

"But sadly, Master Ward, very sadly, as I told you when I came across to thank you again in
her name and my own for your kindness to her. She was but in poor plight after her journey;
poor thing, she was little accustomed to such wet and hardship, and doubtless they took all
the more effect because she was low in spirit and weakened with much grieving. That night she
was taken with a sort of fever, hot and cold by turns, and at times off her head. Since then
she has lain in a high fever and does not know even my wife; her thoughts ever go back to the
storming of the castle, and she cries aloud and begs them to spare her lord's life. It is pitiful
to hear her. The leech gives but small hope for her life, and in troth, Master Ward, methinks
that God would deal most gently with her were He to take her. Her heart is already in her husband's
grave, for she was ever of a most loving and faithful nature. Here there would be little comfort
for her--she would fret that her boy would never inherit the lands of his father; and although
she knows well enough that she would be always welcome here, and that Bertha would serve her
as gladly and faithfully as ever she did when she was her nurse, yet she could not but greatly
feel the change. She was tenderly brought up, being, as I told you last week, the only daughter
of Sir Harold Broome. Her brother, who but a year ago became lord of Broomecastle at the death
of his father, was one of the queen's men, and it was he, I believe, who brought Sir Roland
Somers to that side. He was slain on the same night as Mortimer, and his lands, like those
of Sir Roland, have been seized by the crown. The child upstairs is by right heir to both estates,
seeing that his uncle died unmarried. They will doubtless be conferred upon those who have
aided the young king in freeing himself from his mother's domination, for which, indeed, although
I lament that Lady Alice should have suffered so sorely in the doing of it, I blame him not
at all. He is a noble prince and will make us a great king, and the doings of his mother have
been a shame to us all. However, I meddle not in politics. If the poor lady dies, as methinks
is well-nigh certain, Bertha and I will bring up the boy as our own. I have talked it over
with my wife, and so far she and I are not of one mind. I think it will be best to keep him
in ignorance of his birth and lineage, since the knowledge cannot benefit him, and will but
render him discontented with his lot and make him disinclined to take to my calling, in which
he might otherwise earn a living and rise to be a respected citizen. But Bertha hath notions.
You have not taken a wife to yourself, Master Geoffrey, or you would know that women oft have
fancies which wander widely from hard facts, and she says she would have him brought up as
a man-at-arms, so that he may do valiant deeds, and win back some day the title and honour
of his family."

Geoffrey Ward laughed. "Trust a woman for being romantic," he said. "However, Master Fletcher,
you need not for the present trouble about the child's calling, even should its mother die.
At any rate, whether he follows your trade, or whether the blood in his veins leads him to
take to martial deeds, the knowledge of arms may well be of use to him, and I promise you that
such skill as I have I will teach him when he grows old enough to wield sword and battle-axe.
As you know I may, without boasting, say that he could scarce have a better master, seeing
that I have for three years carried away the prize for the best sword-player at the sports.
Methinks the boy will grow up into a strong and stalwart man, for he is truly a splendid lad.
As to archery, he need not go far to learn it, since your apprentice, Will Parker, last year
won the prize as the best marksman in the city bounds. Trust me, if his tastes lie that way
we will between us turn him out a rare man-at-arms. But I must stand gossiping no longer; the
rumours that we are likely ere long to have war with France, have rarely bettered my trade.
Since the wars in Scotland men's arms have rusted somewhat, and my two men are hard at work
mending armour and fitting swords to hilts, and forging pike-heads. You see I am a citizen
though I dwell outside the bounds, because house rent is cheaper and I get my charcoal without
paying the city dues. So I can work somewhat lower than those in the walls, and I have good
custom from many in Kent, who know that my arms are of as good temper as those turned out by
any craftsman in the city."

Giles Fletcher's anticipations as to the result of his guest's illness turned out to be well
founded. The fever abated, but left her prostrate in strength. For a few weeks she lingered;
but she seemed to have little hold of life, and to care not whether she lived or died. So,
gradually she faded away.

"I know you will take care of my boy as if he were your own, Bertha," she said one day; "and
you and your husband will be far better protectors for him than I should have been had I lived.
Teach him to be honest and true. It were better, methinks, that he grew up thinking you his
father and mother, for otherwise he may grow discontented with his lot; but this I leave with
you, and you must speak or keep silent according as you see his disposition and mind. If he
is content to settle down to a peaceful life here, say nought to him which would unsettle his
mind; but if Walter turn out to have an adventurous disposition, then tell him as much as you
think fit of his history, not encouraging him to hope to recover his father's lands and mine,
for that can never be, seeing that before that time can come they would have been enjoyed for
many years by others; but that he may learn to bear himself bravely and gently as becomes one
of good blood."

A few days later Lady Alice breathed her last, and at her own request was buried quietly and
without pomp, as if she had been a child of the bowman, a plain stone, with the name "Dame
Alice Somers", marking the grave.

The boy grew and throve until at fourteen years old there was no stronger or sturdier lad of
his age within the city bounds. Giles had caused him to be taught to read and write, accomplishments
which were common among the citizens, although they were until long afterwards rare among the
warlike barons. The greater part of his time, however, was spent in sports with lads of his
own age in Moorfields beyond the walls. The war with France was now raging, and, as was natural,
the boys in their games imitated the doings of their elders, and mimic battles, ofttimes growing
into earnest, were fought between the lads of the different wards. Walter Fletcher, as he was
known among his play-fellows, had by his strength and courage won for himself the proud position
of captain of the boys of the ward of Aldgate.

Geoffrey Ward had kept his word, and had already begun to give the lad lessons in the use of
arms. When not engaged otherwise Walter would, almost every afternoon, cross London Bridge
and would spend hours in the armourer's forge. Geoffrey's business had grown, for the war had
caused a great demand for arms, and he had now six men working in the forge. As soon as the
boy could handle a light tool Geoffrey allowed him to work, and although not able to wield
the heavy sledge Walter was able to do much of the finer work. Geoffrey encouraged him in this,
as, in the first place, the use of the tools greatly strengthened the boy's muscles, and gave
him an acquaintance with arms. Moreover, Geoffrey was still a bachelor, and he thought that
the boy, whom he as well as Giles had come to love as a son, might, should he not take up the
trade of war, prefer the occupation of an armourer to that of a bowmaker, in which case he
would take him some day as his partner in the forge. After work was over and the men had gone
away, Geoffrey would give the lad instructions in the use of the arms at which he had been
at work, and so quick and strong was he that he rapidly acquired their use, and Geoffrey foresaw
that he would one day, should his thoughts turn that way, prove a mighty man-at-arms.

It was the knowledge which he acquired from Geoffrey which had much to do with Walter's position
among his comrades. The skill and strength which he had acquired in wielding the hammer, and
by practice with the sword rendered him a formidable opponent with the sticks, which formed
the weapons in the mimic battles, and indeed not a few were the complaints which were brought
before Giles Fletcher of bruises and hurts caused by him.

"You are too turbulent, Walter," the bowyer said one day when a haberdasher from the ward of
Aldersgate came to complain that his son's head had been badly cut by a blow with a club from
Walter Fletcher. "You are always getting into trouble, and are becoming the terror of other
boys. Why do you not play more quietly? The feuds between the boys of different wards are becoming
a serious nuisance, and many injuries have been inflicted. I hear that the matter has been
mentioned in the Common Council, and that there is a talk of issuing an order that no boy not
yet apprenticed to a trade shall be allowed to carry a club, and that any found doing so shall
be publicly whipped."

"I don't want to be turbulent," Walter said; "but if the Aldersgate boys will defy us, what
are we to do? I don't hit harder than I can help, and if Jonah Harris would leave his head
unguarded I could not help hitting it."

"I tell you it won't do, Walter," Giles said. "You will be getting yourself into sore trouble.
You are growing too masterful altogether, and have none of the quiet demeanour and peaceful
air which becomes an honest citizen. In another six months you will be apprenticed, and then
I hope we shall hear no more of these doings."

"My father is talking of apprenticing me, Master Geoffrey," Walter said that evening. "I hope
that you will, as you were good enough to promise, talk with him about apprenticing me to your
craft rather than to his. I should never take to the making of bows, though, indeed, I like
well to use them; and Will Parker, who is teaching me says that I show rare promise; but it
would never be to my taste to stand all day sawing, and smoothing, and polishing. One bow is
to me much like another, though my father holds that there are rare differences between them;
but it is a nobler craft to work on iron, and next to using arms the most pleasant thing surely
is to make them. One can fancy what good blows the sword will give and what hard knocks the
armour will turn aside; but some day, Master Geoffrey, when I have served my time, I mean to
follow the army. There is always work there for armourers to do, and sometimes at a pinch they
may even get their share of fighting."

Walter did not venture to say that he would prefer to be a man-at-arms, for such a sentiment
would be deemed as outrageous in the ears of a quiet city craftsman as would the proposal of
the son of such a man nowadays to enlist as a soldier. The armourer smiled; he knew well enough
what was in Walter's mind. It had cost Geoffrey himself a hard struggle to settle down to a
craft, and deemed it but natural that with the knightly blood flowing in Walter's veins he
should long to distinguish himself in the field. He said nothing of this, however, but renewed
his promise to speak to Giles Fletcher, deeming that a few years passed in his forge would
be the best preparation which Walter could have for a career as a soldier.

CHAPTER II: THE HUT IN THE MARSHES

A week later a party of knights and court gallants, riding across the fields without the walls,
checked their horses to look at a struggle which was going on between two parties of boys.
One, which was apparently the most powerful, had driven the other off from a heap of rubbish
which had been carried without the walls. Each party had a flag attached to a stick, and the
boys were armed with clubs such as those carried by the apprentice boys. Many of them carried
mimic shields made of wood, and had stuffed their flat caps with wool or shavings, the better
to protect their heads from blows. The smaller party had just been driven from the heap, and
their leader was urging them to make another effort to regain it.

"That is a gallant-looking lad, and a sturdy, my Lord de Vaux," a boy of about ten years of
age said. "He bears himself like a young knight, and he has had some hard knocks, for, see,
the blood is streaming down his face. One would scarcely expect to see these varlets of the
city playing so roughly."

"The citizens have proved themselves sturdy fighters before now, my prince," the other said;
"they are ever independent, and hold to their rights even against the king. The contingent
which the city sends to the wars bears itself as well as those of any of the barons."

"See!" the boy interrupted, "they are going to charge again. Their leader has himself seized
the flag and has swung his shield behind him, just as a knight might do if leading the stormers
against a place of strength. Let us stop till we see the end of it."

With a shout of "Aldgate! Aldgate!" the leader of the assailants dashed forward, followed by
his comrades, and with a rush reached the top of the heap.

"Well done!" the young prince exclaimed, clapping his hands. "See how he lays about him with
that club of his. There, he has knocked down the leader of the defenders as if his club had
been a battle-axe. Well done, young sir, well done! But his followers waver. The others are
too strong for them. Stand, you cowards, rally round your leader!" and in his enthusiasm the
young prince urged his horse forward to the scene of conflict.

But the assailants were mastered; few of them could gain the top of the heap, and those who
did so were beaten back from it by the defenders. Heavy blows were exchanged, and blood flowed
freely from many of their heads and faces, for in those days boys thought less than they do
now of hard knocks, and manliness and courage were considered the first of virtues. Their leader,
however, still stood his ground on the crest, though hardly pressed on all sides, and used
his club both to strike and parry with a skill which aroused the warmest admiration on the
part of the prince. In vain his followers attempted to come to his rescue; each time they struggled
up the heap they were beaten back again by those on the crest.

"Yield thee prisoner," the assailants of their leader shouted, and the prince in his excitement
echoed the cry. The lad, however, heard or heeded them not. He still kept his flag aloft in
his left hand. With a sudden spring he struck down one of his opponents, plucked up their flag
from the ground, and then fought his way back through his foes to the edge of the battleground;
then a heavy blow struck him on the temple, and, still holding the flags, he rolled senseless
to the foot of the heap. The defenders with shouts of triumph were rushing down when the prince
urged his horse forward.

"Cease!" he said authoritatively. "Enough has been done, my young masters, and the sport is
becoming a broil."

Hitherto the lads, absorbed in their strife, had paid but little heed to the party of onlookers;
but at the word they at once arrested their arms, and, baring their heads, stood still in confusion.

"No harm is done," the prince said, "though your sport is of the roughest; but I fear that
your leader is hurt, he moves not; lift his head from the ground." The boy was indeed still
insensible. "My lords," the prince said to the knights who had now ridden up, "I fear that
this boy is badly hurt; he is a gallant lad, and has the spirit of a true knight in him, citizen's
son though he be. My Lord de Vaux, will you bid your squire ride at full speed to the Tower
and tell Master Roger, the leech, to come here with all haste, and to bring such nostrums as
may be needful for restoring the boy to life."

The Tower was but half a mile distant, but before Master Roger arrived Walter had already recovered
consciousness, and was just sitting up when the leech hurried up to the spot.

"You have arrived too late, Master Roger," the prince said; "but I doubt not that a dose of
cordials may yet be of use, for he is still dazed, and the blow he got would have cracked his
skull had it been a thin one."

The leech poured some cordial from a vial into a small silver cup and held it to the boy's
lips. It was potent and nigh took his breath away; but when he had drunk it he struggled to
his feet, looking ashamed and confused when he saw himself the centre of attention of so many
knights of the court.

"What is thy name, good lad?" the prince asked.

"I am known as Walter Fletcher."

"You are a brave lad," the prince said, "and if you bear you as well as a man as you did but
now, I would wish no better to ride beside me in the day of battle. Should the time ever come
when you tire of the peaceable life of a citizen and wish to take service in the wars, go to
the Tower and ask boldly for the Prince of Wales, and I will enroll you among my own men-at-arms,
and I promise you that you shall have your share of fighting as stark as that of the assault
of yon heap. Now, my lords, let us ride on; I crave your pardon for having so long detained you."

Walter was some days before he could again cross London Bridge to inform his friend Geoffrey
of the honour which had befallen him of being addressed by the Prince of Wales. During the
interval he was forced to lie abed, and he was soundly rated by Master Giles for again getting
into mischief. Geoffrey was far more sympathetic, and said "Well, Walter, although I would
not that Gaffer Giles heard me say so, I think you have had a piece of rare good fortune. It
may be that you may never have cause to recall the young prince's promise to him; but should
you some day decide to embrace the calling of arms, you could wish for nothing better than
to ride behind the Prince of Wales. He is, by all accounts, of a most noble and generous disposition,
and is said, young as he is, to be already highly skilled in arms. Men say that he will be
a wise king and a gallant captain, such a one as a brave soldier might be proud to follow;
and as the king will be sure to give him plenty of opportunities of distinguishing himself,
those who ride with him may be certain of a chance of doing valorous deeds. I will go across
the bridge tomorrow, and will have a talk with Master Fletcher. The sooner you are apprenticed,
the sooner you will be out of your time; and since Madge married eight years since I have been
lonely in the house and shall be glad to have you with me."

Geoffrey Ward found his friend more ready to accede to his request, that Walter should be apprenticed
to him, than he had expected. The bowyer, indeed, was a quiet man, and the high spirits and
somewhat turbulent disposition of his young charge gave him so much uneasiness, that he was
not sorry the responsibility of keeping him in order should be undertaken by Geoffrey. Moreover,
he could not but agree with the argument, that the promise of the Prince of Wales offered a
more favourable opportunity for Walter to enter upon the career of arms and so, perhaps, someday
to win his way back to rank and honours than could have been looked for. Therefore, on the
following week Walter was indentured to the armourer, and, as was usual at the time, left his
abode in Aldgate and took up his residence with his master. He threw himself with his whole
heart into the work, and by the time he was fifteen was on the way to become a skilful craftsman.
His frame and muscles developed with labour, and he was now able to swing all save the very
heaviest hammers in the shop. He had never abated in his practice at arms, and every day when
work was over, he and his master had a long bout together with cudgel or quarterstaff, sword
or axe; Walter of course used light weapons, but so quick was he with them that Geoffrey Ward
acknowledged that he needed to put out all his skill to hold his own with his pupil. But it
was not alone with Geoffrey that Walter had an opportunity of learning the use of arms. Whenever
a soldier, returned from the wars, came to have a weapon repaired by the armourer, he would
be sure of an invitation to come in in the evening and take a stoup of ale, and tell of the
battles and sieges he had gone through, and in the course of the evening would be asked to
have a bout of arms with the young apprentice, whom Geoffrey represented as being eager to
learn how to use the sword as well as how to make it.

Thus Walter became accustomed to different styles of fighting, but found that very few, indeed,
of their visitors were nearly so well skilled with their arms as his master. Some of the soldiers
were mortified at finding themselves unable to hold their own with a boy; others would take
their reverses in good part and would come again, bringing with them some comrade known to
be particularly skilled with his weapons, to try the temper of the armourer's apprentice. At
the age of fifteen Walter had won the prize at the sports, both for the best cudgel play and
the best sword-and-buckler play among the apprentices, to the great disgust of many who had
almost reached the age of manhood and were just out of their time.

On Sundays Walter always spent the day with Giles Fletcher and his wife, going to mass with
them and walking in the fields, where, after service, the citizens much congregated. "i'll name
tomorrow before begin. I've have the superiority to do badly." With
the he travel thus.

Yet wonder the galled had retrieve chivalry. "do you understand?" it caught up to blade, at clip

.
 The ground is across the river, and lies out of my jurisdiction."

"It is for that reason," Geoffrey said, "that I wished that the story should be told to you
privately, since the men concerned might well have sent a friend to the court to hear if aught
was said which might endanger them."

"I will give you a letter to a magistrate of Surrey, and he will despatch some constables under
your guidance to catch these rascals. I fear there have been many murders performed by them
lately besides that in question, and you will be doing a good service to the citizens by aiding
in the capture of these men.

"I will go willingly," the smith assented.

The Lord Mayor said, after a moment's thought. "It will be quicker; I will tell the justice
that if he will come to the meeting of the roads on Kennington Common, at seven this evening,
you will be there with your apprentice to act as a guide."

"I will," the armourer said, "and will bring with me two or three of my men who are used to
hard blows, for, to tell you the truth, I have no great belief in the valour of constables,
and we may meet with a stout resistance."

"So be it," the Lord Mayor said; "and luck be with you, for these men are the scourges of the
river."

That evening the armourer shut up his shop sooner than usual, and accompanied by Walter and
four of his workmen, and all carrying stout oaken cudgels, with hand-axes in their girdles,
started along the lonely road to Kennington. Half an hour after their arrival the magistrate,
with ten men, rode up. He was well pleased at the sight of the reinforcement which awaited
him, for the river pirates might be expected to make a desperate resistance. Geoffrey advised
a halt for a time until it should be well-nigh dark, as the marauders might have spies set
to give notice should strangers enter the marsh.

They started before it was quite dark, as Walter doubted whether he should be able to lead
them straight to the hut after the night had completely fallen. He felt, however, tolerably
sure of his locality, for he had noticed that two trees grew on the edge of the swamp just
at the spot where he had left it. He had no difficulty in finding these, and at once led the
way. The horses of the magistrate and his followers were left in charge of three of their number.

"You are sure you are going right?" the magistrate said to Walter. "The marsh seems to stretch
everywhere, and we might well fall into a quagmire, which would swallow us all up.

"I am sure of my way," Walter answered; "and see, yonder clump of bushes, which you can just
observe above the marsh, a quarter of a mile away, is the spot where the house of their leader
is situated."

With strict injunctions that not a word was to be spoken until the bush was surrounded, and
that all were to step noiselessly and with caution, the party moved forward. It was now nearly
dark, and as they approached the hut sounds of laughter and revelry were heard.

"They are celebrating their success in a carouse," Geoffrey said. "We shall catch them nicely
in a trap."

When they came close, a man who was sitting just at the low mouth of the hut suddenly sprang
to his feet and shouted, "Who goes there?" He had apparently been placed as sentry, but had
joined in the potations going on inside, and had forgotten to look round from time to time
to see that none were approaching.

At his challenge the whole party rushed forward, and as they reached the hut the men from within
came scrambling out, sword in hand. For two or three minutes there was a sharp fight, and had
the constables been alone they would have been defeated, for they were outnumbered and the
pirates were desperate.

The heavy clubs of the armourers decided the fight. One or two of the band alone succeeded
in breaking through, the rest were knocked down and bound; not, however, until several severe
wounds had been inflicted on their assailants.

When the fray was over, it was found that nine prisoners had been captured. Some of these were
stunned by the blows which the smiths had dealt them, and two or three were badly wounded;
all were more or less injured in the struggle. When they recovered their senses they were made
to get on their feet, and with their hands tied securely behind them were marched between a
double line of their captors off the marsh.

"Thanks for your services," the justice said when they had gained the place where they had
left their horses. "Nine of my men shall tie each one of these rascals to their stirrups by
halters round their necks, and we will give them a smart run into Richmond, where we will lodge
them in the jail. Tomorrow is Sunday; on Monday they will be brought before me, and I shall
want the evidence of Master Walter Fletcher and of those who were in the boat with him as to
what took place on the river. Methinks the evidence on that score, and the resistance which
they offered to us this evening, will be sufficient to put a halter round their necks; but
from what I have heard by the letter which the Lord Mayor sent me, there are others higher
in rank concerned in the affair; doubtless we shall find means to make these ruffians speak."

Accordingly, at the justice's orders, halters were placed round the necks of the prisoners,
the other ends being attached to the saddles, and the party set off at a pace which taxed to
the utmost the strength of the wounded men. Geoffrey and his party returned in high spirits
to Southwark.

On the Monday Walter went over to Richmond, accompanied by the armourers and by the lads who
had been in the boat with him. The nine ruffians, strongly guarded, were brought up in the
justice room. Walter first gave his evidence, and related how he had overheard a portion of
the conversation, which led him to believe that an attack would be made upon the boat coming
down the river.

"Can you identify either of the prisoners as being the man whom you saw at the door of the hut?"

"No," Walter said. "When I first saw him I was too far off to make out his face. When he left
the hut it was dark."

"Should you know the other man, the one who was addressed as sir knight, if you saw him again?"

"I should," Walter replied. He then gave an account of the attack upon the boat, but said that
in the suddenness of the affair and the growing darkness he noticed none of the figures distinctly
enough to recognize them again. Two or three of the other apprentices gave similar testimony
as to the attack.

A gentleman then presented himself, and gave his name as Sir William de Hertford. He said that
he had come at the request of the Lady Alice Vernon, who was still suffering from the effects
of the wound and immersion. She had requested him to say that at some future occasion she would
appear to testify, but that in the confusion and suddenness of the attack she had noticed no
faces in the boat which assailed them, and could identify none concerned in the affair.

The justice who had headed the attack on the hut then gave his evidence as to that affair,
the armourer also relating the incidents of the conflict.

"The prisoners will be committed for trial," the justice said. "At present there is no actual
proof that any of them were concerned in this murderous outrage beyond the fact that they were
taken in the place where it was planned. The suspicion is strong that some at least were engaged
in it. Upon the persons of all of them were valuable daggers, chains, and other ornaments,
which could not have been come by honestly, and I doubt not that they form part of the gang
which has so long been a terror to peaceful travelers alike by the road and river, and it may
be that some who have been robbed will be able to identify the articles taken upon them. They
are committed for trial: firstly, as having been concerned in the attack upon Dame Alice Vernon;
secondly, as being notorious ill-livers and robbers; thirdly, as having resisted lawful arrest
by the king's officers. The greatest criminal in the affair is not at present before me, but
it may be that from such information as Dame Vernon may be able to furnish, and from such confessions
as justice will be able to wring from the prisoners, he will at the trial stand beside his
fellows."

Walter returned to town with his companions. On reaching the armourer's they found a retainer
of the Earl of Talbot awaiting them, with the message that the Lady Alice Vernon wished the
attendance of Walter Fletcher, whose name she had learned from the Lord Mayor as that of the
lad to whom she and her daughter owed their lives, at noon on the following day, at the residence
of the Earl of Talbot.

"That is the worst of an adventure," Walter said crossly, after the retainer had departed.
"One can't have a bit of excitement without being sent for, and thanked, and stared at. I would
rather fight the best swordsman in the city than have to go down to the mansion of Earl Talbot
with my cap in my hand."

Geoffrey laughed. "You must indeed have your cap in your hand, Walter; but you need not bear
yourself in that spirit. The 'prentice of a London citizen may have just as much honest pride
and independence as the proudest earl at Westminster; but carry not independence too far. Remember
that if you yourself had received a great service you would be hurt if the donor refused to
receive your thanks; and it would be churlish indeed were you to put on sullen looks, or to
refuse to accept any present which the lady whose life you have saved may make you. It is strange,
indeed, that it should be Dame Vernon, whose husband, Sir Jasper Vernon, received the fiefs
of Westerham and Hyde."

"Why should it be curious that it is she?" Walter asked.

"Oh!" Geoffrey said, rather confusedly. "I was not thinking--that is--I mean that it is curious
because Bertha Fletcher was for years a dependant on the family of Sir Roland Somers, who was
killed in the troubles when the king took the reins of government in his hands, and his lands,
being forfeit, were given to Sir Jasper Vernon, who aided the king in that affair."

"I wish you would tell me about that," Walter said. "How was it that there was any trouble
as to King Edward having kingly authority?"

"It happened in this way," Geoffrey said. "King Edward II, his father, was a weak prince, governed
wholly by favourites, and unable to hold in check the turbulent barons. His queen, Isabella
of France, sister of the French king, a haughty and ambitious woman, determined to snatch the
reins of power from the indolent hands of her husband, and after a visit to her brother she
returned with an army from Hainault in order to dethrone him. She was accompanied by her eldest
son, and after a short struggle the king was dethroned. He had but few friends, and men thought
that under the young Edward, who had already given promise of virtue and wisdom, some order
might be introduced into the realm. He was crowned Edward III, thus, at the early age of fifteen,
usurping the throne of his father. The real power, however, remained with Isabella, who was
president of the council of regency, and who, in her turn, was governed by her favourite Mortimer.
England soon found that the change which had been made was far from beneficial. The government
was by turns weak and oppressive. The employment of foreign troops was regarded with the greatest
hostility by the people, and the insolence of Mortimer alienated the great barons. Finally,
the murder of the dethroned king excited throughout the kingdom a feeling of horror and loathing
against the queen.

"All this feeling, however, was confined to her, Edward, who was but a puppet in her hands,
being regarded with affection and pity. Soon after his succession the young king was married
to our queen, Philippa of Hainault, who is as good as she is beautiful, and who is loved from
one end of the kingdom to the other. I can tell you, the city was a sight to see when she entered
with the king. Such pageants and rejoicing were never known. They were so young, he not yet
sixteen, and she but fourteen, and yet to bear on their shoulders the weight of the state.
A braver looking lad and a fairer girl mine eyes never looked on. It was soon after this that
the events arose which led to the war with France, but this is too long a tale for me to tell
you now. The Prince of Wales was born on the 15th of June, 1330, two years after the royal
marriage.

"So far the king had acquiesced quietly in the authority of his mother, but he now paid a visit
to France, and doubtless the barons around him there took advantage of his absence from her
tutelage to shake her influence over his mind; and at the same time a rising took place at
home against her authority. This was suppressed, and the Earl of Kent, the king's uncle, was
arrested and executed by Isabella. This act of severity against his uncle, no doubt, hastened
the prince's determination to shake off the authority of his haughty mother and to assume the
reins of government himself. The matter, however, was not easy to accomplish. Mortimer having
the whole of the royal revenue at his disposal, had attached to himself by ties of interest
a large number of barons, and had in his pay nearly two hundred knights and a large body of
men-at-arms. Thus it was no easy matter to arrest him. It was determined that the deed should
be done at the meeting of the parliament at Nottingham. Here Mortimer appeared with Isabella
in royal pomp. They took their abode at the castle, while the king and other members of the
royal family were obliged to content themselves with an inferior place of residence.

"The gates of the castle were locked at sunset, and the keys brought by the constable, Sir
William Eland, and handed to the queen herself. This knight was a loyal and gallant gentleman,
and regarded Mortimer with no affection, and when he received the king's commands to assist
the barons charged to arrest him he at once agreed to do so. He was aware of the existence
of a subterranean communication leading from the interior of the castle to the outer country,
and by this, on the night of the 19th of October, 1330, he led nine resolute knights--the Lords
Montague, Suffolk, Stafford, Molins, and Clinton, with three brothers of the name of Bohun,
and Sir John Nevil--into the heart of the castle. Mortimer was found surrounded by a number
of his friends. On the sudden entry of the knights known to be hostile to Mortimer his friends
drew their swords, and a short but desperate fight took place. Many were wounded, and Sir Hugh
Turpleton and Richard Monmouth were slain. Mortimer was carried to London, and was tried and
condemned by parliament, and executed for felony and treason. Several of his followers were
executed, and others were attacked in their strongholds and killed; among these was Sir Roland
Somers.

"Queen Isabella was confined in Castle Risings where she still remains a prisoner. Such, Walter,
were the troubles which occurred when King Edward first took up the reins of power in this
realm; and now, let's to supper, for I can tell you that my walk to Kingston has given me a
marvellous appetite. We have three or four hours' work yet before we go to bed, for that Milan
harness was promised for the morrow, and the repairs are too delicate for me to entrust it
to the men. It is good to assist the law, but this work of attending as a witness makes a grievous
break in the time of a busy man. It is a pity, Walter, that your mind is so set on soldiering,
for you would have made a marvellous good craftsman. However, I reckon that after you have
seen a few years of fighting in France, and have got some of your wild blood let out, you will
be glad enough to settle down here with me; as you know, our profits are good, and work plentiful;
and did I choose I might hold mine head higher than I do among the citizens; and you, if you
join me, may well aspire to a place in the common council, aye, and even to an alderman's gown,
in which case I may yet be addressing you the very worshipful my Lord Mayor."

"Pooh!" Walter laughed; "a fig for your lord Mayors! I would a thousand times rather be a simple
squire in the following of our young prince."

CHAPTER IV: A KNIGHT'S CHAIN

The following morning Walter put on the sober russet dress which he wore on Sundays and holidays,
for gay colours were not allowed to the apprentices, and set out for Westminster. Although
he endeavoured to assume an air of carelessness and ease as he approached the dwelling of Earl
Talbot, he was very far from feeling comfortable, and wished in his heart that his master had
accompanied him on his errand. Half a dozen men-at-arms were standing on the steps of the mansion,
who looked with haughty surprise at the young apprentice.

"Dame Alice Vernon has sent to express her desire to have speech with me," he said quietly,
"and I would fain know if she can receive me."

"Here, Dikon," one of the men cried to another within the hall. "This is the lad you were sent
to fetch yesterday. I wondered much who the city apprentice was, who with such an assured air,
marched up to the door; but if what thou sayest be true, that he saved the life of Dame Vernon
and her little daughter, he must be a brave lad, and would be more in place among men and soldiers
than in serving wares behind the counter of a fat city tradesman.

"I serve behind no counter," Walter said indignantly. "I am an armourer, and mayhap can use
arms as well as make them."

There was a laugh among the men at the boy's sturdy self-assertion, and then the man named
Dikon said: "Come along, lad. I will take you to Dame Vernon at once. She is expecting you;
and, my faith, it would not be safe to leave you standing here long, for I see you would shortly
be engaged in splitting the weasands of my comrades."

There was another roar of laughter from the men, and Walter, somewhat abashed, followed his
conductor into the house. Leading him through the hall and along several corridors, whose spaciousness
and splendour quite overpowered the young apprentice, he handed him over to a waiting woman,
who ushered him into an apartment where Dame Vernon was reclining on a couch. Her little daughter
was sitting upon a low stool beside her, and upon seeing Walter she leapt to her feet, clapping
her hands.

"Oh! mother, this is the boy that rescued us out of the river."

The lady looked with some surprise at the lad. She had but a faint remembrance of the events
which occurred between the time when she received a blow from the sword of one of her assailants
and that when she found herself on a couch in the abode of her kinsman; and when she had been
told that she had been saved by a city apprentice she had pictured to herself a lad of a very
different kind to him who now stood before her.

Walter was now nearly sixteen years old. His frame was very powerful and firmly knit. His dark
brown hair was cut short, but, being somewhat longer than was ordinary with the apprentices,
fell with a slight wave back on his forehead. His bearing was respectful, and at the same time
independent. There was none of that confusion which might be expected on the part of a lad
from the city in the presence of a lady of rank. His dark, heavy eyebrows, resolute mouth,
and square chin gave an expression of sternness to his face, which was belied by the merry
expression of his eyes and the bright smile when he was spoken to.

"I have to thank you, young sir," she said, holding out her hand, which Walter, after the custom
of the time, raised to his lips, bending upon one knee as he did so, "for the lives of myself
and my daughter, which would surely have been lost had you not jumped over to save us.

"I am glad that I arrived in time to be of aid," Walter said frankly; "but indeed I am rather
to be blamed than praised, for had I, when I heard the plotting against the safety of the boat,
told my master of it, as I should have done, instead of taking the adventure upon mine own
shoulders, doubtless a boat would have been sent up in time to prevent the attack from taking
place. Therefore, instead of being praised for having arrived a little too late, I should be
rated for not having come there in time."

Dame Vernon smiled.

"Although you may continue to insist that you are to blame, this does not alter the fact that
you have saved our lives. Is there any way in which I can be useful to you? Are you discontent
with your state? For, in truth, you look as if Nature had intended you for a gallant soldier
rather than a city craftsman. Earl Talbot, who is my uncle, would, I am sure, receive you into
his following should you so choose it, and I would gladly pay for the cancelling of your indentures."

"I thank you, indeed, lady, for your kind offices," Walter said earnestly; "for the present
I am well content to remain at my craft, which is that of an armourer, until, at any rate,
I have gained such manly strength and vigour as would fit me for a man-at-arms, and my good
master, Geoffrey Ward, will, without payment received, let me go when I ask that grace of him."

"Edith, go and look from the window at the boats passing along the river; and now," she went
on, as the girl had obeyed her orders, "I would fain ask you more about the interview you overhead
in the marshes. Sir William de Hertford told me of the evidence that you had given before the
justice. It is passing strange that he who incited the other to the deed should have been by
him termed 'Sir Knight'. Maybe it was merely a nickname among his fellows."

"Before I speak, lady," Walter said quietly, "I would fain know whether you wish to be assured
of the truth. Sometimes, they say, it is wiser to remain in ignorance; at other times forewarned
is forearmed. Frankly, I did not tell all I know before the court, deeming that peradventure
you might wish to see me, and that I could then tell the whole to your private ear, should
you wish to know it, and you could then bid me either keep silence or proclaim all I knew when
the trial of these evil-doers comes on."

"You seem to me to be wise beyond your years, young sir," the lady said.

"The wisdom is not mine, lady, but my master's. I took counsel with him, and acted as he advised
me.

"I would fain know all," the lady said. "I have already strange suspicions of one from whom
assuredly I looked not for such evil designs. It will grieve me to be convinced that the suspicions
are well founded; but it will be better to know the truth than to remain in a state of doubt."

"The person then was a knight, for I had seen him before when he came in knightly harness into
my master's shop to have two rivets put into his hauberk. I liked not his face then, and should
have remembered it anywhere. I knew him at once when I saw him. He was a dark faced knight,
handsome, and yet with features which reminded me of a hawk."

Dame Vernon gave a little exclamation, which assured the lad that she recognized the description.

"You may partly know, lady, whether it is he whom you suppose, for he said that he would detain
your boat so that it should not come along until dark, and, moreover, he told them that they
would know the boat since you would be wrapt in a white mantle."

The lady sat for some time with her face hidden in her hands.

"It is as I feared," she said at last, "and it grieves me to the heart to think that one who,
although not so nearly related in blood, I regarded as a brother, should have betrayed me to
death. My mind is troubled indeed, and I know not what course I shall take, whether to reveal
this dreadful secret or to conceal it."

"I may say, madam," Walter said earnestly, "that should you wish the matter to remain a secret,
you may rely upon it that I will tell no more at the trial than I revealed yesterday; but I
would remind you that there is a danger that the leader of yon ruffians, who is probably alone
acquainted with the name of his employer, may, under the influence of the torture, reveal it."

"That fear is for the present past, since a messenger arrived from Kingston but a few minutes
since, saying that yester-even, under the threat of torture, the prisoners had pointed out
the one among their number who was their chief. This morning, however, it was found that the
warder who had charge of them had been bribed; he was missing from his post, and the door of
the cell wherein the principal villain had been immured, apart from the others, was opened,
and he had escaped."

"Then," Walter said, "it is now open to you to speak or be silent as you will. You will pardon
my forwardness if I say that my master, in talking the matter over with me, suggested that
this evil knight might be scared from attempting any future enterprise against you were he
informed that it was known to several persons that he was the author of this outrage, and that
if any further attempts were at any time made against you, the proofs of his crime would be
laid before the king."

"Thanks, good lad," the lady said, "for your suggestion. Should I decide to keep the matter
secret, I will myself send him a message to that effect, in such guise that he would not know
whence it comes. And now, I would fain reward you for what you have done for us; and," she
went on, seeing a flush suddenly mount upon the lad's face, as he made a half step backwards,
"before I saw you, had thought of offering you a purse of gold, which, although it would but
poorly reward your services, would yet have proved useful to you when the time came for you
to start as a craftsman on your own account; but now that I have seen you, I feel that although
there are few who think themselves demeaned by accepting gifts of money in reward for services,
you would rather my gratitude took some other form. It can only do that of offering you such
good services that I can render with Earl Talbot, should you ever choose the profession of
arms; and in the meantime, as a memento of the lives you have saved, you will, I am sure, not
refuse this chain," and she took a very handsome one of gold from her neck; "the more so since
it was the gift of her majesty, our gracious queen to myself. She will, I am sure, acquit me
of parting with her gift when I tell her that I transferred it to one who had saved the lives
of myself and my daughter, and who was too proud to accept other acknowledgment."

Colouring deeply, and with tears in his eyes at the kindness and thoughtful consideration of
the lady, Walter knelt on one knee before her, and she placed round his neck the long gold
chain which she had been wearing.

"It is a knight's chain," the lady said, smiling, "and was part of the spoil gained by King
Edward from the French. Maybe," she added kindly, "it will be worn by a knight again. Stranger
things have happened, you know."

Walter flushed again with pleasure.

"Maybe, lady," he said modestly, "even apprentices have their dreams, and men-at-arms may always
hope, by deeds of valour, to attain a knight's spurs even though they may not be of noble blood
or have served as page and squire to a baron; but whether as a 'prentice or soldier, I hope
I shall never do discredit to your gift."

"Edith, come here," Dame Vernon said, "I have done talking now. And what are you going to give
this brave knight of ours who saved us from drowning."

The girl looked thoughtfully at Walter. "I don't think you would care for presents," she said;
"and you look as if a sword or a horse would suit you better than a girl's gift. And yet I
should like to give you something, such as ladies give their knights who have done brave deeds
for them. It must be something quite my own, and you must take it as a keepsake. What shall
it be, mamma?"

"Give him the bracelet which your cousin gave you last week," her mother said; "I would rather
that you did not keep it, and I know you are not very fond of him."

"I can't bear him," the girl said earnestly, "and I wish he would not kiss me; he always looks
as if he were going to bite, and I will gladly give his bracelet to this brave boy."

"Very well, Edith, fetch the bracelet from that coffer in the corner."

The girl went to the coffer and brought out the little bracelet, then she approached Walter.

"You must go down on your knee," she said; "true knights always do that to receive their lady's
gifts. Now hold out your hand. There," she went on in a pretty imperious way, "take this gage
as a reward of your valour, and act ever as a true knight in the service of your lady."

Bending down she dropt a kiss upon Walter's glowing cheek, and then, half frightened at her
own temerity, ran back to her mother's side.

"And now," Dame Vernon went on, "will you thank your five comrades for their service in the
matter, and give them each two gold pieces to spend as they will."

"He is a noble lad," Dame Vernon had said to herself when Walter had taken his leave. "Would
he had been the son of one of the nobles of the court! It might have been then, if he distinguished
himself in war, as he would surely do, that the king might have assigned Edith to him. As her
lord and guardian he is certain to give her hand as a reward for valour in the field, and it
may well be to a man with whom she would be less happy than with this 'prentice lad; but there,
I need not be troubling myself about a matter which is five or six years distant yet. Still
the thought that Edith is a ward of the crown, and that her hand must go where the king wills,
often troubles me. However, I have a good friend in the queen, who will, I know, exert what
influence she has in getting me a good husband for my child. But even for myself I have some
fears, since the king hinted, when last he saw me, that it was time I looked out for another
mate, for that the vassal of Westerham and Hyde needed a lord to lead them in the field. However,
I hope that my answer that they were always at his service under the leading of my cousin James
will suffice for him. Now, what am I to do in that matter? Who would have thought that he so
coveted my lands that he would have slain me and Edith to possess himself of them? His own
lands a thrice as broad as mine, though men say that he has dipped deeply into them and owes
much money to the Jews. He is powerful and has many friends, and although Earl Talbot would
stand by me, yet the unsupported word of an apprentice boy were but poor evidence on which
to charge a powerful baron of such a crime as this. It were best, methinks, to say nought about
it, but to bury the thought in my own heart. Nevertheless, I will not fail to take the precaution
which the lad advised, and to let Sir James know that there are some who have knowledge of
his handiwork. I hear he crosses the seas tomorrow to join the army, and it may be long ere
he return. I shall have plenty of time to consider how I had best shape my conduct towards
him on his return; but assuredly he shall never be friendly with me again, or frighten Edith
with his kisses."

"Well, Walter, has it been such a dreadful business as you expected?" the armourer asked the
lad when he re-entered the shop. "The great folks have not eaten you at any rate."

"It has not been dreadful," Walter replied with a smile, "though I own that it was not pleasant
when I first arrived at the great mansion; but the lady put me quite at my ease, and she talked
to me for some time, and finally she bestowed on me this chain, which our lady, the queen,
had herself given her."

"It is a knight's chain and a heavy one," Geoffrey said, examining it, "of Genoese work, I
reckon, and worth a large sum. It will buy you harness when you go to the wars."

"I would rather fight in the thickest melee in a cloth doublet," Walter said indignantly, "than
part with a single link of it."

"I did but jest, Walter," Geoffrey said laughing; "but as you will not sell it, and you cannot
wear it, you had best give it me to put aside in my strong coffer until you get of knightly rank."

"Lady Vernon said," the lad replied, "that she hoped one day it might again belong to a knight;
and if I live," he added firmly, "it shall."

"Oh! she has been putting these ideas into your head; nice notions truly for a London apprentice!
I shall be laying a complaint before the lord mayor against Dame Vernon, for unsettling the
mind of my apprentice, and setting him above his work. And the little lady, what said she?
Did she give you her colours and bid you wear them at a tourney?"

Walter coloured hotly.

"Ah! I have touched you," laughed the armourer; "come now, out with the truth. My lad," he
added more gravely, "there is no shame in it; you know that I have always encouraged your wishes
to be a soldier, and have done my best to render you as good a one as any who draws sword 'neath
the king's banner, and assuredly I would not have taken all these pains with you did I think
that you were always to wear an iron cap and trail a pike. I too, lad, hope some day to see
you a valiant knight, and have reasons that you wot not of, for my belief that it will be so.
No man rises to rank and fame any the less quickly because he thinks that bright eyes will
grow brighter at his success."

"But, Geoffrey, you are talking surely at random. The Lady Edith Vernon is but a child; a very
beautiful child," he added reverently, "and such that when she grows up, the bravest knight
in England might be proud to win. What folly for me, the son of a city bowyer, and as yet but
an apprentice, to raise mine eyes so high!"

"The higher one looks the higher one goes," the armourer said sententiously. "You aspire some
day to become a knight, you may well aspire also to win the hand of Mistress Edith Vernon.
She is five years younger than yourself, and you will be twenty-two when she is seventeen.
You have time to make your way yet, and I tell you, though why it matters not, that I would
rather you set your heart on winning Mistress Edith Vernon than any other heiress of broad
lands in merry England. You have saved her life, and so have made the first step and a long
one. Be ever brave, gentle, and honourable, and, I tell you, you need not despair; and now,
lad, we have already lost too much time in talking; let us to our work."

That evening Walter recalled to Geoffrey his promise to tell him the causes which had involved
England in so long and bloody a war with France.

"It is a tangled skein," Geoffrey said, "and you must follow me carefully. First, with a piece
of chalk I will draw upon the wall the pedigree of the royal line of France from Phillip downwards,
and then you will see how it is that our King Edward and Phillip of Valois came to be rival
claimants to the throne of France.

"Now, you see that our King Edward is nephew of Charles le Bel, the last King of France, while
Phillip of Valois is only nephew of Phillip le Bel, the father of Charles. Edward is consequently
in the direct line, and had Isabella been a man instead of a woman his right to the throne
would be unquestionable. In France, however, there is a law called the 'Salic' law, which excludes
females from the throne; but it is maintained by many learned in the law, that although a female
is held to be incompetent to reign because from her sex she cannot lead her armies to battle,
yet she no ways forfeits otherwise her rights, and that her son is therefore the heir to the
throne. If this contention, which is held by all English jurists, and by many in France also,
be well founded, Edward is the rightful King of France. Phillip of Valois contends that the
'Salic law' not only bars a female from ascending the throne, but also destroys all her rights,
and that the succession goes not to her sons but to the next heir male; in which case, of course,
Phillip is rightful king. It is not for me to say which view is the right one, but certainly
the great majority of those who have been consulted have decided that, according to ancient
law and usage, the right lies with Edward. But in these matters 'right is not always might.'
Had Isabella married a French noble instead of an English king it is probable that her son's
claim to the throne would have been allowed without dispute, but her son is King of England,
and the French nobles prefer being ruled by one of themselves to becoming united with England
under one king.

"At the time of the death of the last king, Edward was still but a boy under the tuition of
his mother, Phillip was a man, and upon the spot, therefore he was able to win support by presence
and promises, and so it came that the peers of France declared Phillip of Valois to be their
rightful monarch. Here in England, at parliament held at Northampton, the rights of Edward
were discussed and asserted, and the Bishops of Worcester and Coventry were despatched to Paris
to protest against the validity of Phillip's nomination. As, however, the country was not in
a position to enforce the claim of their young king by arms, Phillip became firmly seated as
King of France, and having shown great energy in at once marching against and repressing the
people of Flanders, who were in a state of rebellion against their count, one of the feudatories
of the French crown, the nobles were well satisfied with their choice, and no question as to
his right was ever henceforth raised in France. As soon as the rebellion in Flanders was crushed,
Phillip summoned the King of England to do homage for Aquitaine, Ponthieu and Montreuil, fiefs
held absolutely from the crown of France. Such a proceeding placed Edward and his council in
a great embarrassment. In case of a refusal the whole of the possessions of the crown in France
might be declared forfeited and be seized, while England was in no condition to defend them;
on the other hand, the fact of doing homage to Phillip of Valois would be a sort of recognition
of his right to the throne he had assumed. Had Edward then held the reins of power in his hands,
there can be little doubt that he would at once have refused, and would have called out the
whole strength of England to enforce his claim. The influence of Isabella and Mortimer was,
however, all powerful, and it was agreed that Edward should do homage as a public act, making
a private reservation in secret to his own councillors, taking exception to the right of Phillip.

"Edward crossed to France and journeyed to Amiens, where Phillip with a brilliant court awaited
him, and on the appointed day they appeared together in the cathedral. Here Edward, under certain
protestations, did homage for his French estates, leaving certain terms and questions open
for the consideration of his council. For some time the matter remained in this shape; but
honest men cannot but admit that King Edward did, by his action at the time, acknowledge Phillip
to be King of France, and that he became his vassal for his estates there; but, as has happened
scores of times before, and will no doubt happen scores of times again, vassals, when they
become powerful enough, throw off their allegiance to their feudal superiors, and so the time
came to King Edward.

"After the death of Mortimer and the imprisonment of Isabella, the king gave rein to his taste
for military sports. Tournaments were held at Dartford and other places, one in Westcheape.
What a sight was that, to be sure! For three days the king, with fourteen of his knights, held
the list against all comers, and in the sight of the citizens and the ladies of the court,
jousted with knights who came hither from all parts of Europe. I was there each day and the
sight was a grand one, though England was well-nigh thrown into mourning by an accident which
took place. The gallery in which the queen and her attendants were viewing the sports had been
badly erected, and in the height of the contests it gave way. The queen and her ladies were
in great peril, being thrown from a considerable height, and a number of persons were severely
injured. The king, who was furious at the danger to which the queen had been exposed, would
have hung upon the spot the master workman whose negligence had caused the accident, but the
queen went on her knees before him and begged his life of the king. The love of Edward for
warlike exercises caused England to be regarded as the most chivalrous court in Europe, and
the frequent tournaments aroused to the utmost the spirits of the people and prepared them
for the war with France. But of the events of that war I will tell you some other night. It
is time now for us to betake us to our beds."

CHAPTER V: THE CITY GAMES

The next evening the armourer, at Walter's request, continued his narrative.

"Soon after the tournament we began to fight again with Scotland. For some years we had had
peace with that country, and under the regency a marriage was made between David, King of Scotland,
son of Robert the Bruce, and the Princess Joan, sister to our king, and a four years' truce
was agreed to."

"But why should we always be fighting with Scotland?" Walter asked.

"That is more than I can tell you, Walter. We were peaceful enough with them until the days
of Edward I; but he set up some claim to the throne of Scotland, the rights of which neither
I nor anyone else, so far as I know, have ever been able to make out. The fact was he was strong,
and thought that he could conquer Scotland. The quarrels between her nobles--most of them were
allied by blood with our own and held possessions in both kingdoms--gave Edward an excuse to
interfere. Scotland was conquered easily enough, but it was a hard task to hold it. Sir William
Wallace kept the country in a turmoil for many years, being joined by all the common people.
He inflicted one heavy defeat upon us at Stirling, but receiving no support from the nobles
he was defeated at Falkirk, and some years afterwards was captured and executed here. His head
you may see any day over London Bridge. As he fought only for his country and had ever refused
allegiance to our king, it seems to me that his fate was a cruel one. Then when all appeared
quiet, Robert Bruce raised Scotland again, and was crowned king. There was war for many years,
but at last, at Bannockburn he inflicted such a defeat upon us as we have never had before.
After that there were skirmishes and excursions, but Edward II was a weak prince, and it seemed
that the marriage of David and the Princess Joan would bring about a permanent peace between
the two countries; but it was not to be so."

"Many of the English nobles held claims by marriage or grants upon lands in Scotland. They
had, of course, been driven from these when the English were turned out by Bruce. By the terms
of the marriage treaty in 1328 it was agreed that they should be reinstated. It was a foolish
clause, because it was plain that the King of Scotland could not take these lands again from
the Scotch nobles who had possession of them, many of them being well-nigh as powerful as himself.
At this time Edward Baliol, son of the great rival of Robert Bruce, was in England. He still
claimed the throne of Scotland as his right. Round him gathered a number of the English nobles
who claimed lands in Scotland. The king offered no hindrance to the gathering of this force,
for I doubt not that he was glad to see dissension in Scotland, which might give him some such
pretext for interference as that which Edward I had seized to possess himself of that country.
At first Baliol was successful, and was crowned at Scone, but he was presently defeated and
driven out of Scotland. The Scots now made an eruption across the frontier as a retaliation
for Edward's having permitted Baliol to gather a force here for his war against Bruce. King
Edward was on the point of starting for Ireland, and he at once hastened north. He defeated
the Scots at Halidon Hill, captured Berwick, and placed Baliol upon the throne. Bruce fled
to France, where he was supported and encouraged by the French king."

"The ill feeling between Edward and Phillip of Valois had gone on increasing ever since the
former had been compelled to take the oath of allegiance to the latter, but outwardly the guise
of friendship was kept up, and negotiations went on between the two courts for a marriage between
the little Prince of Wales and Joanna, daughter of the French king."

"The aid which Phillip gave to Bruce increased the bad feeling, and Edward retaliated for Phillip's
patronage of Bruce by receiving with the greatest honour and courtesy Robert of Artois, a great
feudatory of France, who had been banished by King Phillip. For a time, although both countries
were preparing for war, peace was not broken, as Edward's hands were full in Scotland, where
Baliol having bestowed immense possessions upon the English nobles who had assisted him, the
country again rose in favour of Bruce. During the three years that followed King Edward was
obliged several times to go to Scotland to support Baliol, who held the crown as his feudal
vassal. He was always successful in the field, but directly his army recrossed the frontier
the Scotch rose again. In 1330 a new crusade was preached, and in October of that year King
Phillip solemnly received the cross and collected an immense army nominally for the recovery
of Jerusalem. Whether his intentions were honest or not I cannot say, but certainly King Edward
considered that Phillip's real aim in creating so great an army was to attack England. Whether
this was so or not would need a wiser head than mine, Walter, to tell. Certainly Phillip of
Valois invited Edward to cooperate with him in the crusade. The king in reply stated his belief
that the preparations were intended for war in Europe rather than in Asia; but that if the
King of France would agree to conclude a firm league of amity between the two countries, to
restore the castles and towns of Aquitaine, whose surrender had been frequently promised but
never carried out, and would bind himself by oath to give no assistance, direct or indirect,
to Scotland, he would join him in his war for the delivery of the Holy Land."

"I must say that King Edward's demands were reasonable, for it was clear that he could not
march away from England with his whole force and leave Baliol unsupported against the assaults
of his Scotch enemies, aided by France. Phillip was willing to accede to the first two conditions;
but in regard to the third positively declined treating until David Bruce should be restored
to the throne of his father. Now, had the French king openly supported Bruce from the first,
none could have said that his conduct in befriending a dethroned monarch was aught but noble
and generous; but he had all along answered Edward's complaints of the aid afforded by Frenchmen
to the Bruce by denials that he himself supported him; and this declaration in his favour now
certainly seemed to show that he had at last determined openly to throw off the veil, and that
his great army was really collected against England. Robert of Artois craftily seized a moment
when the king's indignation against Phillip was at the highest. At a great banquet held by
King Edward, at which all his warlike nobles were present, Robert entered, preceded by two
noble maidens carrying a heron, which, as you know, Walter, is considered the most cowardly
of birds. Then in loud tones he called upon the knights present each to swear on the bird to
perform some deed of chivalrous daring. First he presented it to King Edward himself, giving
him to understand that he regarded him but as little braver than the heron for resigning without
a blow the fair heritage of France."

"The moment was well chosen, for Edward was smarting under the answer he had just received
from Phillip. He at once rose and took an oath to enter France in arms; to wait there a month
in order to give Phillip time to offer him battle, and to accept the combat, even should the
French outnumber him ten to one. Every knight present followed the example of the king, and
so the war with France, which had been for years a mere question of time, was at last suddenly
decided upon. You yourself, Walter, can remember the preparations which were made throughout
England: men were enrolled and arms prepared. We armourers were busy night and day, and every
man felt that his own honour, as well as that of the country, was concerned in winning for
King Edward the heritage of which he had been unlawfully robbed by the King of France."

"On the 17th of March, 1337, at the parliament at Westminster, the king created the little
prince, then seven years of age, Duke of Cornwall; and the prince immediately, in exercise
of his new dignity, bestowed upon twenty of the most distinguished aspirants the honour of
knighthood. Immense supplies were voted by the parliaments held at Nottingham, Westminster,
and Northamton. Half the wool shorn in the summer following was granted to the king, with a
variety of other taxes, customs, and duties. The revenues of all the foreign priories in England,
a hundred and ten in number, were appropriated to the crown. Provisions of bacon, wheat, and
oats were granted, and the king pawned his own jewels, and even the crown itself, to hire soldiers,
and purchase him allies on the Continent. So great did the scarcity of money become in the
country that all goods fell to less than half their value. Thus a vast army was raised, and
with this King Edward prepared to try his strength with France."

"Phillip on his part was making great preparations. While Edward had purchased the assistance
of many of the German nobles Phillip raised large armaments in the maritime states of Italy.
Spain also contributed a number of naval adventurers, and squadrons were fitted out by his
vassals on the sea coasts of Normandy, Brittany, and Picardy. King Edward had crossed over
into Belgium, and after vast delays in consequence of the slowness of the German allies, at
last prepared to enter France at the end of September, 1339. Such, my lad, is the story, as
far as I know, of the beginning of that war with France which is now raging, and whose events
you know as well as I do, seeing that they are all of late occurrence. So far, although the
English have had the best of it, and have sorely mauled the French both in the north and south,
we have not gained any such advantages as would lead to a belief that there is any likelihood
of an early termination, or that King Edward will succeed for a long time in winning back his
inheritance of the throne of France."

"There is no doubt that the war weighs heavily upon the people at large. The taxes are doubled,
and the drain of men is heavy. We armourers, of course, have a busy time of it, and all trades
which have to do with the furnishing of an army flourish exceedingly. Moreover, men of mettle
and valour have an opportunity of showing what they are composed of, and England rings with
the tales of martial deeds. There are some, Walter, who think that peace is the greatest of
blessings, and in some ways, lad, they are no doubt right; but there are many compensations
in war. It brings out the noble qualities; it raises men to think that valour and fortitude
and endurance and honour are qualities which are something above the mere huckstering desire
for getting money, and for ignoble ease and comfort. Some day it may be that the world will
change, and that war may become a thing of the past; but to my mind, boy, I doubt whether men
will be any happier or better for it. The priests, no doubt, would tell you otherwise; but
then you see I am an armourer, and so perhaps am hardly a fair judge on the matter, seeing
that without wars my craft would come to an end."

Walter remained in thought for some time. "It seems to me, Master Geoffrey, that while wars
may suit strong and courageous men, women would rejoice were such things to be at an end."

"Women suffer most from wars, no doubt," Geoffrey said, "and yet do you mark that they are
more stirred by deeds of valour and chivalry than are we men; that they are ever ready to bestow
their love upon those who have won honour and glory in war, even although the next battle may
leave them widows. This has been always somewhat of a marvel to me; but I suppose that it is
human nature, and that admiration for deeds of valour and bravery is ingrained in the heart
of man, and will continue until such times come that the desire for wealth, which is ever on
the increase, has so seized all men that they will look with distaste upon everything which
can interfere with the making of money, and will regard the man who amasses gold by trading
as a higher type than he who does valiant deeds in battle."

"Surely that can never be," Walter said indignantly.

"There is no saying," the armourer answered; "at any rate, Walter, it will matter little to
you or to me, for many generations must pass before such a state of things can come about."

Two days later Walter, who had been across into the city, returned in a state of excitement.

"What do you think, Geoffrey? The king, with the Prince of Wales and all his court, are coming
to the games next month. They say that the king himself will adjudge the prizes; and there
is to be a grand assault-at-arms between ten of the 'prentices with a captain, and an equal
number of sons of nobles and knights."

"That will be rare," Geoffrey Ward exclaimed; "but there will be some broken limbs, and maybe
worse. These assaults-at-arms seldom end without two or three being killed. However, you youngsters
will not hit as hard as trained knights; and if the armour be good, no great damage should
be done."

"Do you think that I shall be one of the ten?" Walter asked anxiously.

"Just as if you did not know you would," Geoffrey replied, laughing. "Did you not win the prize
for swordplay last year? And twelve months have added much to the strength of your arm, to
say nothing of your skill with weapons. If you win this year again--and it will be strange
if you do not--you are like enough to be chosen captain. You will have tough fighting, I can
tell you, for all these young aspirants to knighthood will do their best to show themselves
off before the king and queen. The fight is not to take place on horseback, I hope; for if
so, it will be settled as soon as it begins."

"No, it is to be on foot; and the king himself is to give orders as to the fighting."

"You had best get out that helmet and coat of mail of yours," Geoffrey said, "I warrant me
that there will be none of finer make or of truer metal in the tourney, seeing that I made
them specially for you. They are light, and yet strong enough to withstand a blow from the
strongest arm. I tried them hard, and will warrant them proof, but you had best see to the
rivets and fastenings. They had a rough handling last year, and you have not worn them since.
There are some other pieces that I must put in hand at once, seeing that in such a melee you
must be covered from head to foot."

For the next week nothing was talked of in London but the approaching sports, and the workmen
were already engaged in the erection of the lists and pavilions in the fields between the walls
and Westminster. It was reported that the king would add valuable prizes to those given to
the winners by the city; that there would be jousting on horseback by the sons of the court
nobles, and that the young Prince of Wales would himself ride.

The king had once before taken part in the city sports, and with ten of the citizens had held
his own against an equal number of knights. This was at the commencement of his reign; but
the accident to the queen's stand had so angered him that he had not again been present at
the sports, and his reappearance now was considered to be an act of approval of the efforts
which the city had made to aid him in the war, and as an introduction of the young prince to
the citizens.

When the day arrived there was a general flocking out of the citizens to the lists. The scene
was a picturesque one; the weather was bright and warm; the fields were green; and Westminster,
as well as London, sent out large numbers to the scene. The citizens were all in their best;
their garments were for the most part of somber colours--russet, murrey, brown, and gray. Some,
indeed, of the younger and wealthier merchants adopted somewhat of the fashion of the court,
wearing their shoes long and pointed, and their garments parti-coloured. The line of division
was down the centre of the body; one leg, arm, and half the body would be blue, the other half
russet or brown. The ladies' dresses were similarly divided. Mingling with the citizens, as
they strolled to and fro upon the sward, were the courtiers. These wore the brightest colours,
and their shoes were so long that the points were looped up to the knees with little gold chains
to enable them to walk. The ladies wore headdresses of prodigious height, culminating in two
points; and from these fell, sweeping to the ground, streamers of silk or lighter material.
Cloths of gold and silver, rich furs, silks, and velvets, were worn both by men and women.

None who saw the nobles of the court walking in garments so tight that they could scarce move,
with their long parti-coloured hose, their silk hoods buttoned under the chin, their hair braided
down their back, would have thought that these were the most warlike and courageous of knights,
men whose personal prowess and gallantry were the admiration of Europe. Their hair was generally
cut close upon the forehead, and the beard was suffered to grow, but was kept trimmed a moderate
length. Many of the ladies had the coat-of-arms of their family embroidered upon their dresses,
giving them the appearance of heralds' tabards. Almost all wore gold or silver girdles, with
embroidered pouches, and small daggers.

Thus the appearance of the crowd who moved about among the fields near the lists was varied
and brilliant indeed. Their demeanour was quiet, for the London merchants deemed a grave demeanour
to belong to their calling, and the younger men and apprentices restrained their spirits in
the presence of their superiors. For their special amusement, and in order, perhaps, to keep
them from jostling too freely against the court gallants and ladies, the city authorities had
appointed popular sports such as pleased the rougher classes; and bull baiting, cock-fighting,
wrestling for a ram, pitching the bar, and hand ball, were held in a field some distance away.
Here a large portion of the artisans and apprentices amused themselves until the hour when
the king and queen were to arrive at their pavilion, and the contests were to commence.

Presently a sound of trumpets was heard, and the royal procession was seen moving up from Westminster.
Then the minor sports were abandoned; the crowd gathered round the large fenced-in space, and
those who, by virtue of rank or position in the city, had places in the various stands, took
their places there.

There was a flourish of trumpets as the king and queen appeared in front of the pavilion, accompanied
by the Prince of Wales and many of the nobles of the court, and a shout of welcome arose from
the crowd. The shooting at a mark at once began. The preliminary trials had been shot off upon
the preceding day, and the six chosen bowmen now took their places.

Walter had not entered for the prizes at archery. He had on previous years shot well; but since
he had fully determined to become a man-at-arms he had given up archery, for which, indeed,
his work at the forge and his exercises at arms when the fires were out, left him but little
time. The contest was a close one, and when it was over the winner was led by the city marshal
to the royal pavilion, where the queen bestowed upon him a silver arrow, and the king added
a purse of money. Then there were several combats with quarterstaff and broadsword between
men who had served among the contingents sent by the city to aid the king in his wars. Some
good sword-play was shown and many stout blows exchanged, two or three men were badly hurt,
and the king and all present were mightily pleased with the stoutness with which they fought.

The apprentices then came forward to compete for the prizes for sword-play. They wore light
iron caps and shirts of thickly quilted leather, and fought with blunted swords, for the city
fathers deemed wisely that with these weapons they could equally show their skill, and that
with sharpened swords not only would severe wounds be given, but bad blood would be created
between the apprentices of the various wards. Each ward sent its champion to the contest, and
as these fought in pairs, loud was the shouting which rose from their comrades at each blow
given or warded, and even the older citizens joined sometimes in the shouting and took a warm
interest in the champions of their respective wards.

The iron caps had stout cheek-pieces which defended the sides of the face and neck, for even
a blunted sword can deliver a terrible blow if it fall upon the naked flesh. It took a long
time to get through the combats; the pairs were drawn by lot, and fought until the king decided
which was the superior. Some were speedily beaten, at other times the contests were long and
severe. It was generally thought by the apprentices that the final contest lay between Walter
Fletcher of Aldgate and Ralph Smith of Ludgate. The former was allowed to be superior in the
use of his weapon, but the latter was also skilful, was two years older, and greatly superior
in strength. He had not taken part in the contest in the preceding year, as he had been laid
up with a hurt in his hand which he had got in his employment as a smith, and the lads of Ludgate
were confident that he would turn the tables upon the champion of the eastern ward. Both had
defeated with ease the various opponents whom they had met, but it chanced that they had not
drawn together until the last round, when they remained alone to struggle for the first and
second prizes.

The interest in the struggle had increased with each round, and wagers were freely laid upon
the result. According to custom the two champions had laid aside their leathern shirts and
had donned mail armour, for it was considered that the crowning contest between the two picked
young swordsmen of the city would be a severe one, and greater protection to the limbs was needed.

Before taking their places they were led up to the royal pavilion, where they were closely
inspected by the king and his nobles.

"You are sure that this man is still an apprentice?" the king asked the Lord Mayor, who was
seated next to him; "he has the appearance of a man-at-arms, and a stout one too; the other
is a likely stripling, and is, as I have seen, marvellously dexterous with his sword, but he
is but a boy while the other is a grown man.

"He is an apprentice, my liege, although his time will be up in a few days, while the other
has yet three years to serve, but he works for an armourer, and is famed through the city,
boy as he is, for his skill with weapons."

After a few words to each, exhorting them to do their best in the sight of the queen and her
ladies, the king dismissed them.

"I know the young one now!" the Prince of Wales said, clapping his hands as the apprentices
turned away to take their places. "My Lord Talbot, I will wager a gold chain with you upon
the smaller of the two."

"I will take your wager," the noble answered; "but I am by no means sure that I shall win it,
for I have watched your champion closely, and the downright blows which he struck would seem
to show that he has the muscle and strength of a man though still but a boy."

The event justified the Prince of Wales's confidence; at the commencement of the struggle Ralph
Smith tried to beat down his opponent by sheer strength as he had done his prior opponents,
but to his surprise he found that all his efforts could not break down his opponent's guard.
Walter indeed did not appear to take advantage of his superior lightness and activity, but
to prefer to prove that in strength as well as skill he was equal to his antagonist. In the
latter respect there was no comparison, for as soon as the smith began to relax his rain of
blows Walter took the offensive and with a sweeping blow given with all his strength broke
down his opponent's guard and smote him with such force upon his steel cap that, blunted as
the sword was, it clove through the iron, and stretched the smith senseless on the ground.
A loud shout broke from the assemblage. The marshal came up to Walter, and removing his helmet,
led him to the royal pavilion, while Ralph was carried to a tent near, where a leech attended
his wound.

CHAPTER VI: THE MELEE

"You have won your prize stoutly and well, sir 'prentice," the king said. "I should not have
deemed it possible that one of your age could have smitten such a blow, and right glad should
I be of a few hundred lads of your mettle to follow me against the French. What is your calling?"

"I am an armourer, my liege," Walter answered.

"And you are as good at mending armour as you are at marring it," the king said, "you will
be a rare craftsman one of these days. 'Tis a rare pity so promising a swordsman should be
lost to our army. Wouldst like to change your calling, boy, and take to that of arms?"

"It is my hope to do so, sir," Walter answered modestly, "and his grace the Prince of Wales
has already promised me that I shall some day ride behind him to the wars."

"Ah! Edward," the king ejaculated, "how is this? Have you been already enlisting a troop for
the wars?"

"No, sir," the young prince replied, "but one day, now some four years since, when I was riding
with my Lord Talbot and others in the fields near the Tower I did see this lad lead his play-fellows
to the assault of an earthen castle held by others, and he fought so well and gallantly that
assuredly no knight could have done better, until he was at last stricken senseless, and when
he recovered I told him that should he choose to be a man-at-arms I would enlist him in my
following to the wars."

The king laughed.

"I deemed not that the lads of the city indulged in such rough sports; but I wonder not, seeing
that the contingent which my good city of London furnishes me is ever one of the best in my
army. We shall see the lad at work again tomorrow and will then talk more of it. Now let us
bestow upon him the prize that he has so well earned."

Walter bent on one knee, and the queen handed to him a sword of the best Spanish steel, which
was the prize given by the city to the victor. The king handed him a heavy purse of gold pieces,
saying:

"This may aid in purchasing your freedom."

Walter bowed deeply and murmured some words of thanks, and was then led off by the marshal.
After this many of the young nobles of the court jousted on horseback, ran at the ring, and
performed other feats of knightly exercise to the great pleasure of the multitude. The marshal
on leading Walter away said to him, "You will be captain of the city band tomorrow, and I must
therefore tell you what the king purports. He has prepared a surprise for the citizens, and
the present show will be different to anything ever before seen in London. Both to show them
somewhat of the sieges which are taking place on the borders of France and the Low Countries,
in which Sir Walter Manny and many other gallant knights have so greatly distinguished themselves,
and as an exercise for the young nobles, he has determined that there shall be a castle erected.
It will be built of wood, with battlements and towers, with a moat outside. As soon as the
lists are over a large number of workmen will commence its erection; the pieces are all sawn
and prepared. There will be machines, ladders, and other appliances. The ten champions on either
side will fight as knights; you will have a hundred apprentices as men-at-arms, and the court
party will have an equal number of young esquires. You, as winner of today's tourney, will
have the choice of defence or attack. I should advise you to take the defence, since it is
easier and requires less knowledge of war, and many of the other party have accompanied their
fathers and masters in the field and have seen real sieges carried out."

"Can you show me a plan of the castle," Walter said, "if it be not contrary to the rules, in
order that I may think over tonight the plan of fighting tomorrow?"

"Here it is," the marshal said. "You see that the walls are 200 feet long, they are 12 feet
in height, with a tower at the end and one over the gateway in the centre six feet high. There
is a drawbridge defended by an outwork of palisades six feet high. The moat will be a dry one,
seeing that we have no means of filling it with water, but it will be supposed to be full,
and must be crossed on planks or bridges. Two small towers on wheels will be provided, which
may be run up to the edge of the moat, and will be as high as the top of the towers.

"Surely they cannot make all this before morning?" Walter said.

"They will do so," the marshal replied. "The castle has been put together in the king's courtyard,
and the pieces are all numbered. Two hundred carpenters will labour all night at it, besides
a party of labourers for the digging of the moat. It will be a rare show, and will delight
both the citizens and the ladies of the court, for such a thing has never before been attempted.
But the king grudges not the expense which it will cost him, seeing that spectacles of this
kind do much to arouse the warlike spirit of the people. Here is a list of the various implements
which will be provided, only it is understood that the mangonels and arblasts will not be provided
with missiles, seeing that many would assuredly be killed by them. They will be employed, however,
to show the nature of the work, and parties of men-at-arms will be told off to serve them.
Crossbows and arrows will be used, but the weapons will be blunted. You will see that there
are ladders, planks for making bridges, long hooks for hauling men down from the wall, beams
for battering down the gate, axes for cutting down the palisades, and all other weapons. The
ten who will serve under you as knights have already been nominated, and the city will furnish
them with full armour. For the others, the apprentices of each ward will choose sufficient
representatives to make up the hundred, who will fight as men-at-arms; these will wear steel
caps and breastpieces, with leather jerkins, and vizors to protect their faces, for even a
blunted arrow or wooden quarrel might well kill if it struck true."

On leaving the marshal Walter joined Giles Fletcher and Geoffrey Ward, who warmly congratulated
him upon his success. He informed them of the spectacle which the king had prepared for the
amusement of the citizens on the morrow.

"In faith," Geoffrey said, "the idea is a good one, and promises rare sport, but it will be
rough, and we may expect many broken limbs, for it be no joke to be thrown down with a ladder
from a wall even twelve feet high, and there will be the depth of the moat besides."

"That will only be two feet," Walter said, "for so it is marked on the plan."

"And which do you mean to take, Walter, the attack or the defence? Methinks the king has erred
somewhat in making the forces equal, for assuredly the besiegers should outnumber the besieged
by fully three to one to give them a fair chance of success."

"I shall take the assault," Walter answered; "there is more to be done that way than in the
defence. When we get home, Geoffrey, we will look at the plans, and see what may be the best
manner of assault."

Upon examining the plan that evening they found that the wall was continued at an angle at
either end for a distance of some twenty feet back so as to give a postern gate behind each
of the corner towers through which a sortie might be made. Geoffrey and Walter talked the matter
over, and together contrived a plan of operation for the following day.

"You will have one great advantage," Geoffrey said. "The apprentices are all accustomed to
the use of the bow, while the young nobles will know but little of that weapon; therefore your
shooting will be far straighter and truer, and even a blunt-headed arrow drawn from the shoulder
will hit so smart a blow that those on the wall will have difficulty in withstanding them."

After the talk was ended Walter again crossed London Bridge, and made his way to Ludgate, where
he found his late antagonist, whose head had been plastered up, and was little the worse for
the conflict.

"There is no ill-will between us, I hope," Walter said, holding out his hand.

"None in the world," the young smith said frankly. He was a good-tempered-looking young giant,
with closely-cropped hair, light-blue eyes, and a pleasant but somewhat heavy face.

"My faith but what a blow was that you gave me; why, one would think that your muscles were
made of steel. You deny how dreadful it is to all flour were erected at who don't know or don't had marched

 These, however, received them with great steadiness,
and while some continued the attack the rest turned upon the garrison, and, headed by Ralph

"They fight well and steadily," the king said. "One would have thought that they had reckoned
on the sortie, so steadily did they receive it."

As only a portion of the garrison had issued out they were unable to resist long the pressure
of the apprentices, who drove them back step by step to the sally-port, and pressing them hard
endeavoured to force their way in at their heels.

CHAPTER VII: THE YOUNG ESQUIRE

While the attention of the whole of the spectators and combatants was fixed upon the struggle
at the right-hand angle of the castle, a party of twenty 'prentices suddenly leapt to their
feet from among the broken palisades of the outwork. Lying prone there they had escaped the
attention of the spectators as well as of the defenders. The reason why the assailants carried
the planks and ladders to this spot was now apparent. Only a portion had been taken on to the
assault of the right-hand tower; those who now rose to their feet lifted with them planks and
ladders, and at a rapid pace ran towards the left angle of the castle, and reached that point
before the attention of the few defenders who remained on the wall there was attracted to them,
so absorbed were they in the struggle at the other angle. The moment that they saw the new
assailants they raised a shout of alarm, but the din of the combat, the shouts of the leaders
and men were so loud, that their cries were unheard. Two or three then hurried away at full
speed to give the alarm, while the others strove to repel the assault. Their efforts were in
vain. The planks were flung across the moat, the ladders placed in position, and led by Walter
the assailants sprang up and gained a footing on the wall before the alarm was fairly given.
A thundering cheer from the spectators greeted the success of the assailants. Springing along
the wall they drove before them the few who strove to oppose them, gained the central tower,
and Walter, springing up to the top, pulled down the banner of the defenders and placed that
of the city in its place. At this moment the defenders, awakened too late to the ruse which
had been played upon them, came swarming back along the wall and strove to regain the central
tower. In the confusion the assault by the flying tower of the assailants was neglected, and
at this point also they gained footing on the wall. The young nobles of the court, furious
at being outwitted, fought desperately to regain their lost laurels. But the king rose from
his seat and held up his hand. The trumpeter standing below him sounded the arrest of arms,
which was echoed by two others who accompanied Earl Talbot, who had taken his place on horseback
close to the walls. At the sound swords dropt and the din abruptly ceased, but the combatants
stood glaring at each other, their blood too heated to relinquish the fray readily.

Already much damage had been done. In spite of armour and mail many serious wounds had been
inflicted, and some of the combatants had already been carried senseless from the field. Some
of the assailants had been much shaken by being thrown backward from the ladders into the moat,
one or two were hurt to death; but as few tourneys took place without the loss of several lives,
this was considered but a small amount of damage for so stoutly fought a melee, and the knowledge
that many were wounded, and some perhaps dying, in no way damped the enthusiasm of the spectators,
who cheered lustily for some minutes at the triumph which the city had obtained. In the galleries
occupied by the ladies and nobles of the court there was a comparative silence. But brave deeds
were appreciated in those days, and although the ladies would far rather have seen the victory
incline the other way, yet they waved their handkerchiefs and clapped their hands in token
of their admiration at the success of an assault which, at the commencement, appeared well-nigh
hopeless.

Lord Talbot rode up to the front of the royal pavilion.

"I was about to stop the fight, sire, when you gave the signal. Their blood was up, and many
would have been killed had the combat continued. But the castle was fairly won, the central
tower was taken and the flag pulled down, a footing had been gained at another point of the
wall, and the assailants had forced their way through the sally-port. Further resistance was
therefore hopeless, and the castle must be adjudged as fairly and honourably captured."

A renewed shout greeted the judge's decision. The king now ordered the rival hosts to be mustered
before him as before the battle, and when this was done Earl Talbot conducted Walter up the
broad steps in front of the king's pavilion. Geoffrey Ward, who had, after fastening on Walter's
armour in the tent, before the sports began, taken his place among the guards at the foot of
the royal pavilion, stept forward and removed Walter's helmet at the foot of the steps.

"Young sir," the king said, "you have borne yourself right gallantly today, and have shown
that you possess the qualities which make a great captain. I do my nobles no wrong when I say
that not one of them could have better planned and led the assault than you have done. Am I
not right, sirs?" and he looked round. A murmur of assent rose from the knights and nobles,
and the king continued: "I thought you vain and presumptuous in undertaking the assault of
a fort held by an equal number, many of whom are well accustomed to war, while the lads who
followed you were all untrained in strife, but you have proved that your confidence in yourself
was not misplaced. The Earl of Talbot has adjudged you victor, and none can doubt what the
end of the strife would have been. Take this chain from your king, who is glad to see that
his citizens of London are able to hold their own even against those of our court, than whom
we may say no braver exist in Europe. Kneel now to the queen of the tourney, who will bestow
upon you the chaplet which you have so worthily earned."

Walter bent his knee before Edith Vernon. She rose to her feet, and with an air of pretty dignity,
placed a chaplet of laurel leaves, wrought in gold and clasped with a valuable ruby, on his head.

"I present to you," she said, "the chaplet of victory, and am proud that my gage should have
been worn by one who has borne himself so bravely and well. May a like success rest on all
your undertakings, and may you prove a good and valiant knight!"

"Well said, Mistress Edith," Queen Philippa said smiling. "You may well be proud of your young
champion. I too must have my gift," and drawing a ring set with brilliants from her finger
she placed it in Walter's hand.

The lad now rose to his feet. "The prince my son," the king said, "has promised that you shall
ride with his men-at-arms when he is old enough to take the field. Should you choose to abandon
your craft and do so earlier I doubt not that one of my nobles, the brave Sir Walter Manny,
for example, will take you before that time."

"That will I readily enough," Sir Walter said, "and glad to have so promising a youth beneath
my banner."

"I would that you had been of gentle blood," the king said.

"That makes no difference, sire," Sir Walter replied. "I will place him among the young gentlemen,
my pages and esquires, and am sure that they will receive him as one of themselves."

Geoffrey Ward had hitherto stood at the foot of the steps leading to the royal pavilion, but
doffing his cap he now ascended. "Pardon my boldness, sire," he said to the king, "but I would
fain tell you what the lad himself has hitherto been ignorant of. He is not, as he supposes,
the son of Giles Fletcher, citizen and bowmaker, but is the lawfully born son of Sir Roland
Somers, erst of Westerham and Hythe, who was killed in the troubles at the commencement of
your majesty's reign. His wife, Dame Alice, brought the child to Giles Fletcher, whose wife
had been her nurse, and dying left him in her care. Giles and his wife, if called for, can
vouch for the truth of this, and can give you proofs of his birth."

Walter listened with astonishment to Geoffrey's speech. A thrill of pleasure rushed through
his veins as he learned that he was of gentle blood and might hope to aspire to a place among
the knights of King Edward's court. He understood now the pains which Geoffrey had bestowed
in seeing that he was perfected in warlike exercises, and why both he and Giles had encouraged
rather than repressed his love for martial exercises and his determination to abandon his craft
and become a man-at-arms when he reached man's estate.

"Ah is it so?" the king exclaimed. "I remember Sir Roland Somers, and also that he was slain
by Sir Hugh Spencer, who, as I heard on many hands, acted rather on a private quarrel than,
as he alleged, in my interest, and there were many who avowed that the charges brought against
Sir Roland were unfounded. However, this matter must be inquired into, and my High Justiciar
shall see Master Giles and his wife, hear their evidence, and examine the proofs which they
may bring forward. As to the estates, they were granted to Sir Jasper Vernon and cannot be
restored. Nevertheless I doubt not that the youth will carve out for himself a fortune with
his sword. You are his master, I suppose? I would fain pay you to cancel his apprenticeship.
Sir Walter Manny has promised to enroll him among his esquires."

"I will cancel his indentures willingly, my liege," the armourer answered, "and that without
payment. The lad has been to me as a son, and seeing his high spirit, and knowing the gentle
blood running in his veins, I have done my best so to teach him and so to put him in the way
of winning back his father's rank by his sword."

"He hath gone far towards it already," the king said, "and methinks may yet gain some share
in his father's inheritance," and he glanced at little Mistress Edith Vernon and then smiled
at the queen. "Well, we shall see," he went on. "Under Sir Walter Manny he will have brave
chances of distinguishing himself, and when my son takes the field he shall ride with him.
But I am keeping the hosts waiting. Bring hither," he said to Earl Talbot, "Clarence Aylmer."

The young noble was led up to the king. "You have done well, Clarence; though you have been
worsted you fought bravely, but you were deceived by a ruse which might have taken in a more
experienced captain. I trust that you will be friends with your adversary, who will be known
to you henceforth as Walter Somers, son of Sir Roland of that name, and who will ride to the
wars, whither you also are shortly bound, under the standard of Sir Walter Manny."

The cloud which had hung over the face of the young noble cleared. It had indeed been a bitter
mortification to him that he, the son of one of the proudest of English nobles, should have
been worsted by a London apprentice, and it was a relief to him to find that his opponent was
one of knightly blood. He turned frankly to Walter and held out his hand. "I greet you as a
comrade, sir," he said, "and hope some day that in our rivalry in the field I may do better
than I have done today."

"That is well spoken," the king said. Then he rose and in a loud voice addressed the combatants,
saying, that all had borne themselves well and bravely, and that he thanked them, not only
for the rare pastime which they had made, but for the courage and boldness which had been displayed
on both sides. So saying, he waved his hand as a token that the proceedings were ended, and
returned with the court to Westminster; while the crowd of spectators overflowed the lists,
those who had friends in the apprentice array being anxious to know how they had fared. That
evening there was a banquet given by the lord-mayor. Walter was invited to be present, with
Giles and Geoffrey, and many complimentary things were said to him, and he was congratulated
on the prospects which awaited him. After dinner all the 'prentices who had taken part in the
sports filed through the hall and were each presented with a gold piece by the lord-mayor,
in the name of the corporation, for having so nobly sustained the renown of the city.

After the entertainment was over Walter returned with Geoffrey to the bowyer's house, and there
heard from his two friends and Bertha the details of his mother's life from the time that she
had been a child, and the story of her arrival with him, and her death. He had still difficulty
in believing that it was all true, that Giles and Bertha, whom he had so long regarded as father
and mother, were only his kind guardians, and that he was the scion of two noble families.
Very warmly and gratefully he thanked his three friends for the kindness which they had shown
to him, and vowed that no change of condition should ever alter his feelings of affection towards
them. It was not until the late hour of nine o'clock that he said goodbye to his foster parents,
for he was next day to repair to the lodging of Sir Walter Manny, who was to sail again before
the week was out for the Low Countries, from which he had only returned for a few days to have
private converse with the king on the state of matters there. His friends would have delivered
to him his mother's ring and other tokens which she had left, but thought it better to keep
these, with the other proofs of his birth, until his claim was established to the satisfaction
of the lord justiciaries.

The next morning early, when Walter descended the stairs, he found Ralph Smith waiting for
him. His face was strapped up with plaster and he wore his arm in a sling, for his armour had
been twice cut through as he led his party in through the sally-port.

"How goes it with you, Ralph?" Walter said. "Not much the worse, I hope, for your hard knocks?"

"Not a whit," Ralph replied cheerfully, "and I shall be all right again before the week is
out; but the leech made as much fuss over me as if I had been a girl, just as though one was
not accustomed to hard knocks in a smithy. Those I got yesterday were not half so hard as that
which you gave me the day before. My head rings yet with the thought of it. But I have not
come to talk about myself. Is the story true which they tell of you, Master Walter, that you
are not the son of Giles the bowyer, but of a great noble?"

"Not of a great noble, Ralph, but of a gallant knight, which is just as good. My father was
killed when I was three years old, and my mother brought me to Bertha, the wife of Giles the
bowyer, who had been her nurse in childhood. I had forgotten all that had passed, and deemed
myself the son of the good citizen, but since I have heard the truth my memory has awakened
somewhat, and I have a dim recollection of a lordly castle and of my father and mother."

"And they say, Walter, that you are going with Sir Walter Manny, with the force which is just
sailing to the assistance of Lady De Montford."

"That is so, Ralph, and the good knight has taken me among his esquires, young as I am, although
I might well have looked for nothing better than to commence, for two years at least, as a
page, seeing that I am but eighteen now. Now I shall ride with him into the battles and shall
have as good a chance as the others of gaining honour and winning my spurs."

"I have made up my mind that I will go with you, Master Walter, if you will take me; each squire
has a man-at-arms who serves him, and I will give you good and faithful service if you will
take me with you. I spoke to the smith, my master, last night when I heard the news, and as
my apprenticeship is out next week he was willing enough to give me the few days which remain.
Once out of my apprenticeship I may count to be a man, and seeing that I am nineteen, and as
I may say well grown of my years, methinks I am fit for service as a man-at-arms, and I would
rather fight behind you than labour all my life in the smithy."

"I shall be glad indeed, Ralph, to have you with me if such be really your wish, and I do not
think that Sir Walter Manny will say nay, for they have been beating up for recruits through
the kingdom, and we proved yesterday that you have courage as well as strength. If he will
consent I should be glad indeed to have so brave a comrade with me, so we may consider that
settled, and if you will come down to Westminster, to Sir Walter Manny's lodging, this afternoon,
I will tell you what he says touching the matter. You will, of course, need arms and armour."

"I can provide that," Ralph replied, "seeing that his worshipful the lord-mayor bestowed upon
me yesterday five gold pieces as the second in command in the sports. I have already a steel
cap and breast and back pieces, which I have made for myself in hours of leisure, and warrant
will stand as hard a knock as the Frenchmen can give them."

Going across into the city with Geoffrey, Walter purchased, with the contents of the purse
which the king had given him, the garments suited for his new position. He was fortunate in
obtaining some which fitted him exactly. These had been made for a young esquire of the Earl
of Salisbury; but the tailor, when he heard from Geoffrey for whom they were required, and
the need for instant despatch, parted with them to Walter, saying that he for whom they were
made could well wait a few days, and that he would set his journeymen to work at once to make
some more of similar fit and fashion.

Walter felt strange in his new attire, and by no means relished the tightness of the garments,
which was strictly demanded by the fashion of the day. His long hose, one of which was of a
deep maroon, the other a bright yellow, came far up above the knee, then came a short pair
of trunks of similar colours divided in the middle. The tight-fitting doublet was short and
circled at the waist by a buff belt mounted in silver, and was of the same colours as the hose
and trunks. On his head was a cap, peaked in front; this was of maroon, with a short erect
feather of yellow. The long-pointed shoes matched the rest of the costume. There were three
other suits similar in fashion, but different in colour; two like the first were of cloth,
the third was of white and blue silk, to be worn on grand occasions.

"You look a very pretty figure, Walter," Geoffrey said, "and will be able to hold your own
among the young gallants of the court. If you lack somewhat of courtly manners it will matter
not at all, since you are leaving so soon for the wars.

"The dress sets off your figure, which is fully two years in advance of your age, seeing that
hard work has widened you out and thickened your muscles. I need not tell you, lad, not to
be quarrelsome, for that was never your way; but just at first your companions may try some
jests with you, as is always the manner of young men with newcomers, but take them in a good
spirit and be sure that, seeing the strength of arm and skill which you showed yesterday and
the day before, none will care to push matters with you unduly."

One of the journeymen accompanied Walter to Westminster to carry up from the boat the valise
with his clothes and the armour which he had worn in the sports. Sir Walter received the lad
with much kindness and introduced him to his future companions. They were five in number; the
eldest was a man of some thirty years old, a Hainaulter, who had accompanied Sir Walter Manny
to England at the time when the latter first came over as a young squire in the suite of the
Princess Philippa. He was devotedly attached to the knight, his master, and although he might
several times have received the rank of knighthood for his bravery in the field, he preferred
remaining in his position as esquire and faithful friend of his master.

The other four were between the ages of nineteen and twenty-one, and all belonged to the families
of the highest nobility of England, it being deemed a distinguished honour to be received as
a squire by the most gallant knight at the court of England. Their duties were, as Walter soon
learned, almost nominal, these being discharged almost exclusively by John Mervaux. Two of
the young esquires, Richard Coningsby and Edward Clifford, had fought in the melee, having
been among the ten leaders under Clarence Aylmer. They bore no malice for the defeat, but received
Walter with cordiality and kindness, as did the other young men. Walter on his arrival acquainted
the knight with Ralph's wish to follow him, and requested permission for him to do so. This
was readily granted, Sir Walter Manny telling the lad that although esquires were supposed
to wait entirely upon themselves, to groom their horses, and keep their armour and arms bright
and in good order, yet, in point of fact, young men of good families had the greater part of
these duties performed for them by a retainer who rode in the ranks of their master's following
as a man-at-arms.

"The other esquires have each one of their father's retainers with them, and I am glad that
you should be in the same position. After you have taken your midday meal you had best go across
to the Earl of Talbot's and inquire for the Lady Vernon, who is still staying with him. She
told me at the king's ball last night that she wished to have speech with you, and I promised
to acquaint you with her desire. By the way, dost know aught of riding?"

"I have learnt to sit on a horse, Sir Walter," the lad answered. "My good friend Geoffrey,
the armourer, advised that I should learn, and frequently hired from the horse-dealer an animal
for my use. I have often backed half-broken horses which were brought up by graziers from Kent
and Sussex for use in the wars. Many of them abode at the hostels at Southwark, and willingly
enough granted me permission to ride their horses until they were sold. Thus I have had a good
deal of practice, and that of a rough kind; and seeing that latterly the horses have, for the
most part, found it difficult to fling me when sitting barebacked across them, I think I could
keep my seat in the high-peaked saddles on the most vicious, but I have had no practice at
tilting, or at the ring, or other knightly exercises."

"That matters not at all," the knight said. "All these knightly exercises which you speak of
are good in time of peace, for they give proficiency and steadiness, but in time of war he
who can sit firmly in his saddle and wield sword and battle-axe lustily and skillfully is equal
to the best; but never fear, when this expedition is over, and we have time for such things,
I will see that you are instructed in them. One who has achieved so much martial skill as you
have done at so early an age will have little difficulty in acquiring what may be termed the
pastime of chivalry."

Ralph arrived just as Walter was setting out. The latter presented him to the knight, who spoke
with praise of the gallantry which he had displayed on the previous day, and then handed him
over to John Mervaux, with instructions to enroll him as a man-at-arms among his followers,
to inform him of his duties, and to place him with those who attended upon the other esquires.

After seeing Ralph disposed of, Walter went across to the Earl of Talbot and was again conducted
to the presence of Dame Vernon.

"You have changed since we met last, young sir," she said with a smile, "though it is but a
month since. Then you were a 'prentice boy, now you are an esquire of Sir Walter Manny, and
on the highway to distinction. That you will win it I am well assured, since one who risked
his life to rescue a woman and child whose very names were unknown to him is sure to turn out
a noble and valiant knight. I little thought when my daughter called you her knight, that in
so short a time you might become an aspirant to that honour. I hope that you do not look askance
at us, now that you know I am in possession of the lands of your parents. Such changes of land,
you know, often occur, but now I know who you are, I would that the estates bestowed upon Sir
Jasper had belonged to some other than you; however, I trust that you will hold no grudge against
us, and that you may win as fair an estate by the strength of your arm and the king's favour."

"Assuredly I feel no grudge, madam," Walter replied, "and since the lands were forfeited, am
pleased that of all people they should have gone to one so kind and so fair as yourself."

"What, learning to be a flatterer already!" Dame Vernon laughed. "You are coming on fast, and
I predict great things from you. And now, Edith, lay aside that sampler you are pretending
to be so busy upon and speak to this knight of yours."

Edith laid down her work and came forward. She was no longer the dignified little queen of
the tournament, but a laughing, bright-faced girl.

"I don't see that you are changed," she said, "except in your dress. You speak softly and naturally,
just as you used to do, and not a bit like those little court fops, Uncle Talbot's pages. I
am afraid you will not want to be my knight any more, now that you are going to get great honours
at the war; for I heard my Uncle Talbot tell my lady mother that he was sure you would gain
great credit for yourself."

"I shall be always your knight," Walter said earnestly; "I told you I should, and I never break
my word. That is," he went on, colouring, "if Dame Vernon makes no objection, as she well might."

"If I did not object before, Walter," she said smiling, "why should I do so now?"

"It is different, my lady; before, it was somewhat of a jest, a sort of childish play on the
part of Mistress Edith, though so far as I was concerned it was no play, but sober earnest.

"It needs no permission from me," Dame Vernon replied, "for you to wear my daughter's colours.
Any knight may proclaim any lady he chooses the mistress of his heart, and a reigning beauty
will often have a dozen young knights who wear her colours. However, I am well content that
one who has done me such great service and who has shown such high promise should be the first
to wear the gage of my little daughter, and if in after years your life fulfils the promise
of your youth, and you remain true to her gage, there is none among all the youths of the court
whom I would so gladly see at her feet. Remember," she said, as Walter was about to speak,
"her hand will not be at my disposal, but at that of the king. His majesty is wont to bestow
the hands of his wards upon those who most distinguish themselves in the field. You have already
attracted his royal attention and commendation. Under Sir Walter Manny you will be sure of
opportunities of distinguishing yourself, and the king may well be glad some day at once to
reward your services and to repair a cruel injustice by bestowing upon you the hand of the
heiress of your father's lands. If I mistake not, such a thought has even now crossed his majesty's
mind, unless I misinterpreted a glance which yesterday passed between him and our sweet queen.
I need not tell you to speak of your hopes to none, but let them spur you to higher exertions
and nobler efforts. Loving my little Edith as I do, I naturally consider the prize to be a
high one. I have often been troubled by the thought that her hand may be some day given to
one by years or temper unsuited for her, and it will be a pleasure to me henceforth to picture
her future connected with one who is, I am sure, by heart and nature fitted for her. And now,
farewell, young sir. May God protect you in the field, and may you carry in the battle which
awaits you the gage of my daughter as fairly and successfully as you did in the mimic fray
of yesterday!"

CHAPTER VIII: OFF TO THE WARS

Two days later Walter started with Sir Walter Manny, with a large number of knights, squires,
men-at-arms, and archers, for the Orwell. Walter was mounted, as were the other squires and
men-at-arms, and indeed many of the archers. Ralph Smith, in the attire of a man-at-arms, rode
behind.

Walter was in the highest spirits. A brilliant career was open to him under the most favourable
circumstances; he had already distinguished himself, and had gained the attention of the highest
personages in the realm, his immediate lord was one of the bravest and most chivalrous knights
in Europe, and he had to sustain and encourage him the hopes that Lady Vernon had given him,
of regaining some day the patrimony of his father. It was a satisfaction to him that he was
as well born as those who surrounded him, and his purse was well lined as any in the company.
Although he had spent the largess which had been bestowed upon him at the tournament in procuring
clothes fitted for his rank, he was yet abundantly supplied with money, for both Geoffrey Ward
and Giles Fletcher, having no children of their own and being both well-to-do men, had insisted
upon his accepting a sum which would enable him to make a good appearance with the best.

A large number of squires followed the banner of Sir Walter Manny. The records of the time
show that the barons were generally accompanied in the field by almost as many squires as men-at-arms.
The former were men of good family, sons of knights and nobles, aspirants for the honour of
knighthood, and sons of the smaller gentry. Many were there from pure love of a life of excitement
and adventure, others in fulfilment of the feudal tenure by which all land was then held, each
noble and landowner being obliged to furnish so many knights, squires, men-at-arms, and archers,
in accordance with the size of his holding. The squires fought in the field in the front rank
of the men-at-arms, save those who, like Walter, were attached to the person of their leader,
and who in the field fought behind him or bore his orders to the companies under his banner.

In the field all drew pay, and it may be interesting in the present day to know what were the
rates for which our forefathers risked their lives. They were as follows: each horse archer
received 6 deniers, each squire 12 deniers or 1 sol, each knight 2 sols, each knight banneret
4 sols. 20 sols went to the pound, and although the exact value of money in those days relative
to that which it bears at the present time is doubtful, it may be placed at twelve times the
present value. Therefore each horse archer received an equivalent to 6s. a day, each squire
12s., each knight 24s., and each knight banneret 48s. per day.

Upon their arrival at the Orwell, where many troops from other parts had been gathered, the
expedition at once embarked on board the numerous ships which had been collected. As that in
which Sir Walter sailed also carried several of his knights there was not room for all his
young esquires, and Walter and the three other juniors were told off into another ship. She
was a smaller vessel than most of those which composed the expedition, and only carried twelve
men-at-arms and as many archers, together with the four young squires, and a knight, Sir John
Powis, who was in command of the whole.

"Your craft is but a small one," the knight said to the captain.

"She is small, but she is fast," the latter answered. "She would sail round and round the best
part of the fleet. I had her built according to my own fancy. Small though she be, I warrant
you she will be one of the first to arrive at Hennebon, and the sooner the better say I, since
I am but paid by the trip, and would fain be back again at my regular work. It pays better
carrying merchants' goods between London and Holland than taking his majesty's troops over
to France."

"Your speed will not be of much avail," Sir John Powis said, "seeing that the fleet will keep
together."

"Yes, I know that is the order," the captain answered; "but accidents happen sometimes, you
know"--and his eye twinkled. "Vessels get separated from fleets. If they happen to be slow
ones so much the worse for those on board; if they happen to be fast ones so much the better,
seeing that those they carry will arrive long before their comrades, and may be enabled to
gain credit and renown while the others are whistling for a wind in mid-ocean. However, we
shall see."

The next morning the fleet sailed from the Orwell. It contained 620 men-at-arms, among whom
were many of the noblest and bravest of the country, and 6000 picked archers in the pay of
the king. The whole were commanded by Sir Walter. The scene was a very gay one. The banners
of the nobles and knights floated from the lofty poops, and the sun shone on bright armour
and steel weapons. Walter, who had never seen the sea before, was delighted. The wind was fair,
and the vessels glided smoothly along over the sea. At evening the knight and his four young
companions gathered in the little cabin, for it was in the first week in March, and the night
was cold.

"Will you please tell me, Sir John," Walter said to the knight, "the merits of this quarrel
in which we are going to fight? I know that we are going in aid of the Countess of Montford;
but why she is in a sore strait I know not."

"The matter is a mixed one, Walter, and it requires a herald to tell you all the subtleties
of it. John III, Duke of Brittany, was present with his liege lord, Phillip of Valois, in the
last war with England, on the border of the low country. When the English retired from before
Tournay Phillip dismissed his nobles. The Duke of Burgundy was taken ill, and died at Caen,
in Normandy, on the 30th of April, 1341. Arthur II, his father, had been twice married. By
his first wife he had three sons, John, Guy, and Peter. John and Peter left no issue. Guy,
who is also dead, left a daughter, Joan. By his second wife, Jolande de Dieux, Duke Arthur
had one son, John, Count of Montford. Thus it happened, that when Duke John died, his half-brother,
the Count of Montford, and Joan, daughter of his second brother Guy, were all that survived
of the family. These were the rival claimants for the vacant dukedom. In England we have but
one law of succession, which rules through the whole land. In France it is different. There
the law of succession depends entirely upon the custom of the county, dukedom, or lordship,
which is further affected both by the form of grant by which the territory was conveyed to
its first feudal possessors and by the mode in which the province had been acquired by the
kings of France. This is important, as upon these circumstances alone it depended whether the
son or the granddaughter of Arthur II should inherit the dukedom.

"Joan claimed the duchy as the daughter of the elder brother. The Salic law of France, which
barred females from the right of succession, and in virtue of which Philip of Valois succeeded
to the throne instead of King Edward, certainly did not obtain in Brittany. Duke John regarded
Joan as his heiress, and married her to Charles of Blois, nephew of the King of France, thus
strengthening her in her position; and he also induced the provincial parliament of Brittany
to acknowledge her husband as his successor in the dukedom. Altogether it would seem that right
is upon Joan's side; but, on the other hand, the Count of Montford is the son of Jolande, a
great heiress in Brittany. He is an active and energetic noble. The Bretons love not too close
a connection with France, and assuredly prefer to be ruled by a duke whom they regard as one
of themselves rather than by Charles of Blois, nephew of the French king. Directly Duke John
was dead the Count of Montford claimed the inheritance. Assuming the title of duke he rode
to Nantes, where the citizens did him homage, and then proceeded to Limoges with a large train
of men-at-arms, and there took possession of the immense treasures which the late duke had
accumulated in the course of a long and tranquil reign. With these sinews of war at his command
he turned to Nantes, where he had left his wife the countess, who was a sister of the Count
of Flanders. He immediately invited the nobility of Brittany to a grand banquet, but only one
knight of any renown presented himself at the feast, the rest all holding aloof. With the wealth
of which he had possessed himself he levied large forces and took the field. He first marched
against Brest, where the garrison, commanded by Walter de Clisson, refused to acknowledge him.
After three days' hard fighting the place was taken. Rennes was next besieged, and presently
surrendered. Other towns fell into his hands, and so far as Brittany was concerned all opposition,
except in one or two fortresses, ceased. In the meanwhile Charles of Blois sought assistance
from his uncle the King of France; the Count de Montford, therefore, crossed to England and
besought the aid of King Edward, and did homage to him as King of France. Edward, on his part,
promised to assist him. The fact that Phillip was sure to espouse the opposite side was in
itself sufficient to decide him; besides which, the dukes of Brittany have always been in a
special way connected with England and bear the English title of Earls of Richmond.

"Believing that his journey, which had been a secret one, was unknown to the King of France,
De Montford went boldly to Paris, where he had been summoned by the king to an assembly of
peers called to decide upon the succession. He found, however, that Phillip had already obtained
news of his journey to England. His manner convinced De Montford that it was unsafe to remain
in Paris, and he secretly made his escape. Fifteen days afterwards the peers gave judgment
in favour of Charles of Blois. The Dukes of Normandy, Burgundy, and Bourbon, the Counts of
Alencon, Eu, and Guisnes, and many other French nobles, prepared to lead an army into the field
to support Charles, and the king added a body of 3000 Genoese mercenaries in his pay.

"Knowing the storm that was preparing to break upon him, De Montford put every town and castle
in a state of defence. He himself, confiding in the affection of the inhabitants of Nantes,
remained in that city, while his wife repaired to Rennes.

"The Duke of Normandy advanced from Angiers with an army of 5000 men-at-arms and a numerous
infantry, and after capturing the castle of Chantoceaux marched to Nantes and laid siege to
the city. A sortie was made by the besieged, led by Henry de Leon, but, being attacked by the
whole of the French army, they were driven back into the town, a great many of the citizens
being killed. A warm altercation took place between Henry de Leon and De Montford, who attributed
to him the evil result of the sortie. The result was that a large number of the citizens whose
friends had been captured by the French conspired to deliver up the place to Charles of Blois,
and Henry de Leon also entered into private negotiations with the Duke of Normandy. De Montford,
finding that he could rely neither upon the citizens nor the soldiers, surrendered to the duke
on condition that his life was spared. He was sent to Paris, where he still remains a prisoner.
Winter was coming on, and after putting Nantes in a fresh state of defence and leaving Charles
of Blois there, the Duke of Normandy dismissed his forces, engaging them to reassemble in the
spring. Had he pushed on at once he would have experienced no resistance, so great was the
panic which the surrender of Nantes and the capture of De Montford had caused among the latter's
partisans.

"In Rennes, especially, the deepest despondency was felt. The countess, however, showed the
greatest courage and firmness. Showing herself, with her infant in her arms, she appealed to
the citizens, and by her courageous bearing inspired them with new hopes. Having restored heart
at Rennes she traveled from garrison to garrison throughout the province, and filled all with
vigour and resolution. Feeling, however, the hopelessness of her struggle against all France,
she despatched Sir Almeric de Clisson, who had lately joined her party, to England, to ask
the aid which the king had promised. He arrived a month since, and, as you see, our brave king
has not been long in despatching us to her aid; and now, youngsters, to bed, for methinks that
the sea is rougher than it was and that the wind is getting up."

"Aye, that is it," the captain, who heard the knight's closing words, exclaimed. "We are in
for a storm, and a heavy one, or my name is not Timothy Martin, and though with plenty of sea-room
the Kitty makes not much ado about a storm more or less, it's a very different thing in the
middle of a fleet of lubberly craft, which may run one down at any time. I shall edge out of
them as soon as I can, you may be sure."

Before morning a serious gale was blowing, and for the next three or four days Walter and his
companions knew nothing of what was going on. Then the storm abated, and they staggered out
from their cabin. The sea was still high, but the sun shone brightly overhead. In front of
them the land was visible. They looked round, but to their astonishment not a sail was in sight.

"Why, where is the fleet?" Walter exclaimed in astonishment.

"Snug in the Thames, I reckon," the captain said. "Soon after the storm came on one of the
sailors pretended he saw the lights of recall on the admiral's ship; but I was too busy to
look that way, I had enough to do to look after the safety of the ship. Anyhow, I saw no more
of them."

"And what land is that ahead?" Walter asked.

"That is Brittany, young sir, and before nightfall we shall be in the port of Hennebon; as
to the others, it may be days and it may be weeks before they arrive."

The lads were not sorry at the chance which had taken them to their destination before their
companions and had given them a chance of distinguishing themselves. Late in the afternoon
the ship dropped anchor off the castle of Hennebon, and Sir John Powis and his following were
conveyed in the ship's boats to shore. The countess received them most graciously, and was
delighted at the news that so strong a force was on its way to her aid.

"In the absence of Sir Walter Manny, madam, I place myself and my men at your orders. Our horses
will be landed the first thing in the morning, and we will then ride whithersoever you may bid us."

"Thanks, Sir John," the countess replied. "In that case I would that you ride by Rennes, towards
which the army of the Duke of Normandy is already advancing. The garrison there is commanded
by Sir William of Caddoudal, a good and valiant knight."

The horses were landed on the following morning, and accompanied by the four young squires
and the men-at-arms, and followed by the twenty archers on foot, Sir John Powis set out for
Rennes. They arrived there, but just in time, for the assailants were closing round the city.
They were received with the greatest cordiality by the governor, who assigned apartments to
Sir John and the squires, and lodged the men-at-arms and archers near them.

In a day or two the whole of the French army came up, and the siege commenced. Sir John Powis,
at his own request, was posted with his men for the defence of a portion of the wall which
was especially open to the assaults of the enemy. These soon commenced in earnest, and the
Genoese and Spanish mercenaries endeavoured to carry the place by assault. Sometimes one point
would be attacked, at others points far distant. Covered by the fire of the French crossbowmen,
the Spaniards and Germans came on to the assault, carrying ladders, with which they strove
to climb the walls, but the defenders plied them so vigorously with quarrels from their cross-bows
and flights of arrows that they frequently desisted before reaching the walls. When they pushed
on, and strove to ascend, their luck was no better. Great stones were hurled down, and boiling
oil poured upon them. The ladders were flung back, and many crushed by the fall, and in none
of the assaults did they gain any footing in the town. Machines were used, but these were not
sufficiently powerful to batter down the walls, and at the end of April the city was as far
from being captured as it was on the day of the commencement of the siege.

Walter bore his full share in the fighting, but he had no opportunity of especially distinguishing
himself, although Sir John several times commended him for his coolness when the bolts of the
crossbow-men and the stones from the machines were flying most thickly. But although as yet
uninjured by the enemy's attacks, the prospect of the city holding out was not bright. The
burghers, who had at first fought valiantly, were soon wearied of the strife, and of the hardships
it entailed upon them. The siege had continued but a short time when they began to murmur loudly.
The force under the command of the governor was but a small one, and it would have been impossible
for him to resist the will of the whole population. For a time his exhortations and entreaties
were attended with success, and the burghers returned to their positions on the walls; but
each time the difficulty became greater, and it was clear to Caddoudal and Sir John Powis that
ere long the citizens would surrender the place in spite of them. The English knight was furious
at the cowardliness of the citizens, and proposed to the governor to summon twenty of the leading
burghers, and to hang them as a lesson to the others; but the governor shook his head.

"I have but two hundred men on whom I can rely, including your following, Sir John. We could
not keep down the inhabitants for an hour; and were we to try to do so, they would open the
gates and let in the French. No; I fear that we must await the end."

The following morning Sir John was awoke with the news that in the night Caddoudal had been
seized and thrown into prison by the burghers, and that a deputation of citizens had already
gone out through the gate to treat with the Duke of Normandy for the surrender of the city.

The English knight was furious, but with his little band he could do nothing, especially as
he found that a strong guard of burghers had been placed at the door of the apartments occupied
by him and the esquires, and he was informed that he must consider himself a prisoner until
the conclusion of the negotiations.

Cowardly and faithless as the burghers of Rennes showed themselves to be, they nevertheless
stipulated with the Duke of Normandy, as one of the conditions of the surrender, that Caddoudal,
Sir John Powis, and the troops under them should be permitted to pass through the French lines
and go whithersoever they would. These terms were accepted. At mid-day the governor was released,
and he with his men-at-arms and the band of Englishmen filed out from the city gate, and took
their way unmolested through the lines of the French army to Hennebon.

They had been for a month in ignorance of all that had passed outside the walls, and had from
day to day been eagerly looking for the arrival of Sir Walter Manny with his army to their
relief. Once past the French lines they inquired of the peasantry, and heard to their surprise
that the English fleet had not yet arrived.

"We were in luck indeed," Walter said to his companions, "that Captain Timothy Martin was in
a hurry to get back to his tradings with the Flemings. Had he not been so, we should all this
time have been kicking our heels and fretting on board a ship."

On nearing Hennebon, Sir William Caddoudal, with Sir John Powis and the squires, rode forward
and met the countess. They were the first bearers of the news of the surrender of Rennes, and
the countess was filled with consternation at the intelligence. However, after her first burst
of indignation and regret had passed, she put a brave face on it.

"They shall meet with another reception at Hennebon," she said. "This is but a small place,
and my garrison here, and the soldiers you have brought, will well-nigh outnumber the burghers;
and we need have no fear of such faintheartedness as that which has given Nantes and Rennes
into the hands of my enemy. The English aid cannot tarry long. Until it come we can assuredly
hold the place."

All was now bustle in Hennebon. Sir John Powis took charge of a part of the walls, and busied
himself with his men in placing the machines in position, and in preparing for defence. The
countess, attired in armour, rode through the streets haranguing the townspeople. She urged
the men to fight till the last, and bade the women and girls cut short their dresses so that
they could the better climb the steps to the top of the walls, and that one and all should
carry up stones, chalk, and baskets of lime to be cast down upon the assailants. Animated by
her words and gestures, the townspeople set to work, and all vied with each other, from the
oldest to the youngest, in carrying up stores of missiles to the walls. Never did Hennebon
present such a scene of life and bustle. It seemed like an ant-hill which a passer-by has disturbed.

Absorbed in their work, none had time to think of the dangers which threatened them, and a
stranger would rather have thought from their cheerful and animated countenances that they
were preparing for a great fete than for a siege by an army to which the two chief towns in
Brittany had succumbed.

Ere long the French army was seen approaching. The soldiers, who had been labouring with the
rest, buckled on their armour. The citizens gathered on the walls to hurl down the piles of
stones which had been collected, and all prepared for the assault.

"Sir John Powis," the countess said, "I pray you to grant me one of your esquires, who may
attend me while I ride about, and may bear my messages for me. He will not be idle, nor will
he escape his share of the dangers; for, believe me, I do not intend to hide myself while you
and your brave soldiers are fighting for me.

"Willingly, lady," Sir John answered. "Here is Walter Somers, the son of a good knight, and
himself brave and prudent beyond his years; he will, I am sure, gladly devote himself to your
service."

The French, encouraged by their successes, thought that it would be a comparatively easy task
to capture so small a place as Hennebon, and as soon as their camp was pitched they moved forward
to the attack.

"Come with me, Master Somers," the countess said. "I will mount to one of the watch-towers,
where we may see all that passes."

Walter followed her, and marvelled to see the lightness and agility with which the heroic countess,
although clad in armour, mounted the rickety ladders to the summit of the watch-tower. The
French bowmen opened a heavy fire upon the walls, which was answered by the shafts of the little
party of English bowmen. These did much execution, for the English archers shot far harder
and straighter than those of France, and it was only the best armour which could keep out their
cloth-yard shafts. So small a body, however, could not check the advance of so large a force,
and the French swarmed up to the very foot of the walls.

"Well done, my men!" the countess exclaimed, clapping her hands, as a shower of heavy rocks
fell among the mass of the assailants, who were striving to plant their ladders, crushing many
in their fall; "but you are not looking, Master Somers. What is it that you see in yonder camp
to withdraw your attention from such a fight?"

"I am thinking, Countess, that the French have left their camp altogether unguarded, and that
if a body of horse could make a circuit and fall upon it, the camp, with all its stores, might
be destroyed before they could get back to save it."

"You are right, young sir," the countess exclaimed, "and it shall be done forthwith."

So saying, she descended the stairs rapidly and mounted her horse, which stood at the foot
of the tower; then riding through the town, she collected a party of about three hundred men,
bidding all she met mount their horses and join her at the gate on the opposite side to that
on which the assault was taking place. Such as had no horses she ordered to take them from
those in her own stables. Walter was mounted on one of the best of the count's chargers. Immediately
the force was collected, the gate was opened and the countess rode forth at their head. Making
a considerable detour, the party rode without being observed into the rear of the French camp.
Here only a few servants and horse-boys were found, these were at once killed or driven out;
then all dismounting, set fire to the tents and stores; and ere the French were aware of what
was going on, the whole of their camp was in flames. As soon as the conflagration was perceived,
the French commanders drew off their men from the attack, and all ran at full speed towards
the camp.

"We cannot regain the town," the countess said; "we will ride to Auray at full speed, and re-enter
the castle when best we may."

Don Louis of Spain, who with a considerable following was fighting in the French ranks, hearing
from the flying camp followers that the countess herself was at the head of the party which
had destroyed the camp, instantly mounted, and with a large number of horsemen set off in hot
pursuit. A few of the countess's party who were badly mounted were overtaken and slain, but
the rest arrived safely at Auray, when the gates were shut in the face of their pursuers.

The blow was a heavy one for the besiegers, but they at once proceeded to build huts, showing
that they had no intention of relinquishing the siege. Spies were sent from Auray, and these
reported that the new camp was established on the site of the old one, and that the French
evidently intended to renew the attack upon the side on which they had first commenced, leaving
the other side almost unwatched.

Accordingly, on the fifth day after leaving the town, the countess prepared to return. Except
Walter, none were informed of her intention, as she feared that news might be taken to the
French camp by friends of Charles of Blois; but as soon as it was nightfall, and the gates
were shut, the trumpet sounded to horse. In a few minutes the troop assembled in the market-place,
and the countess, accompanied by Walter, placing herself at their head, rode out from the town.
The strictest silence was observed. On nearing the town all were directed to dismount, to tear
up the horse-cloths, and to muffle the feet of their horses. Then the journey was resumed,
and so careless was the watch kept by the French that they passed through the sentries unobserved,
and reached in safety the gate from which they had issued. As they neared it they were challenged
from the walls, and a shout of joy was heard when Walter replied that the countess herself
was present. The gates were opened and the party entered. The news of their return rapidly
ran through the town, and the inhabitants, hastily attiring themselves, ran into the streets,
filled with joy. Much depression had been felt during her absence, and few had entertained
hopes that she would be able to re-enter the town. She had brought with her from Auray two
hundred men, in addition to the party that had sallied out.

CHAPTER IX: THE SIEGE OF HENNEBON

The besiegers of Hennebon were greatly discouraged at the success of the enterprise of the
countess. They had already attempted several desperate assaults, but had each time been repulsed
with very heavy loss. They now sent to Rennes for twelve of the immense machines used in battering
walls, which had been left behind there on a false report of the weakness of Hennebon. Pending
the arrival of these, Charles of Blois, with one division of the army, marched away to attack
Auray, leaving Don Louis to carry on the siege with a force considered amply sufficient to
compel its surrender after the arrival of the battering machines.

In a few days these arrived and were speedily set to work, and immense masses of stone were
hurled at the walls.

Walter continued to act as the countess's especial squire. She had informed Sir William Caddoudal
and Sir John Powis that it was at his suggestion that she had made the sudden attack upon the
French camp, and he had gained great credit thereby.

The effect of the new machines was speedily visible. The walls crumbled under the tremendous
blows, and although the archers harassed by their arrows the men working them, the French speedily
erected screens which sheltered them from their fire. The spirits of the defenders began to
sink rapidly, as they saw that in a very short time great breaches would be made in the walls,
and that all the horrors and disasters of a city taken by assault awaited them. The Bishop
of Quimper who was within the walls, entered into secret negotiations with his nephew, Henry
de Leon, who had gone over to the enemy after the surrender of Nantes, and was now with the
besieging army. The besiegers, delighted to find an ally within the walls who might save them
from the heavy losses which an assault would entail upon them, at once embraced his offers,
and promised him a large recompense if he would bring over the other commanders and nobles.
The wily bishop set to work, and the consequences were soon visible. Open grumbling broke forth
at the hardships which were endured, and at the prospect of the wholesale slaughter which would
attend a storm when all hope of a successful resistance was at an end.

"I fear, Walter," Sir John said one morning, "that the end is at hand. On all sides submission
is spoken of, and all that I can say to keep up their spirits is useless. Upon our own little
band we can rely, but I doubt if outside them a single determined man is to be found in the
town. In vain do I speak of the arrival of Sir Walter Manny. Nearly ninety days have elapsed
since we sailed, and all hope of his coming is gone. I point out to them that contrary winds
have been blowing, and that at any moment he may arrive; but they will not hear me. The bishop
has gained over the whole of them by his promises that none shall be molested in property or
estate should they surrender."

"It is sad to see the countess," Walter replied; "she who has shown such high spirit throughout
the siege now does nothing but weep, for she knows that with her and her child in the hands
of the French the cause of the count is lost. If she could carry off the child by sea she would
not so much care for the fall of the town, but the French ships lie thick round the port, and
there is no hope of breaking through."

Two days later the conspiracy came to a head, and the people, assembling round the countess's
house, clamoured for surrender. The breaches were open, and the enemy might pour in at any
time and put all to the sword. The countess begged for a little further delay, but in vain,
and withdrew to the turret where she had for so many weary weeks watched the horizon, in hopes
of seeing the sails of the approaching fleet. Walter was at the time with Sir John Powis on
the walls.

Presently a large body of French were seen approaching headed by Henry de Leon, who summoned
the town to surrender. Many standing on the walls shouted that the gates should be thrown open;
but Sir John returned for answer that he must consult the countess, and that upon her answer
must depend whether he and his men would defend the breach until the last.

"Come with me, Walter," he said, "we must fain persuade the countess. If she says no, we Englishmen
will die in the breach; but though ready to give my life for so brave a lady, I own that it
is useless to fight longer. Save our own little band not one in the town will lift a sword
again. Such resistance as we can offer will but inflame them to fury, and all the horrors of
a sack will be inflicted upon the inhabitants. There she is, poor lady, on the turret, gazing,
as usual, seaward."

Suddenly they saw her throw up her arms, and then, turning towards the city, she cried, as
she perceived the English knight: "I see them! I see them! The English fleet are coming!"

"Run up, Walter," Sir John exclaimed, "maybe the countess is distraught with her sorrows."

Walter dashed up to the turret, and looking seaward beheld rising over the horizon a number
of masts.

"Hurrah! Sir John," he shouted, "we are saved, the English fleet is in sight."

Many others heard the shout, and the tidings ran like lightning through the town. In wild excitement
the people ran to the battlements and roofs, and with cheering and clapping of hands hailed
the appearance of the still far-distant fleet. The church bells rang out joyfully and the whole
town was wild with excitement.

The Bishop of Quimper, finding that his plans were frustrated, gathered around him some of
those who had taken a leading part in the intrigue. These, leaving the city by a gate at which
they had placed some of their own faction to open it to the French, issued out and made their
way to the assailants' camp, to give news of the altered situation. Don Louis at once ordered
an attack to be made with his whole force, in hopes of capturing the place before the arrival
of the English succour. But, animated by their new hopes, those so lately despondent and ready
to yield manned the breaches and repulsed with great slaughter all attempts on the part of
the French to carry them. While the struggle was still going on, the countess, aided by the
wives of the burghers, busied herself in preparing a sumptuous feast in honour of her deliverers
who were fast approaching, their ships impelled by a strong and favourable breeze. The vessels
of the French hastily drew off, and the English fleet sailed into the port hailed by the cheers
of the inhabitants. The countess herself received Sir Walter Manny on his landing, and the
townspeople vied with each other in offering hospitality to the men-at-arms and archers.

"Ah! Sir John Powis," Sir Walter exclaimed, "what, are you here? I had given you up for lost.
We thought you had gone down in the gale the night you started."

"We were separated from the fleet, Sir Walter, but the master held on, and we arrived here
four days after we put out. We took part in the siege of Rennes, and have since done our best
to aid the countess here."

"And their best has been much," the countess said; "not to say how bravely they have fought
upon the walls, it is to Sir John and his little band that I owe it that the town was not surrendered
days ago. They alone remained steadfast when all others fell away, and it is due to them that
I am still able, as mistress of this town, to greet you on your arrival. Next to Sir John himself,
my thanks are due to your young esquire, Walter Somers, who has cheered and stood by me, and
to whose suggestions I owe it that I was able at the first to sally out and destroy the French
camp while they were attacking the walls, and so greatly hindered their measures against the
town. And now, sir, will you follow me? I have prepared for you and your knights such a banquet
of welcome as our poor means will allow, and my townspeople will see that good fare is set
before your soldiers."

That evening there was high feasting in the town, although the crash of the heavy stones cast
by the French machines against the walls never ceased. Early the next morning Sir Walter Manny
made a survey of the place and of the disposition of the enemy, and proposed to his knights
to sally forth at once and destroy the largest of the enemy's machines, which had been brought
up close to the walls. In a few minutes the knights were armed and mounted. Three hundred knights
and esquires were to take part in the sortie, they were to be followed by a strong body of
men-at-arms.

As soon as the gates were opened a number of archers issued out, and taking their place at
the edge of the moat, poured a rain of arrows upon the men working the machine and those guarding
it. Most of these took to flight at once, the remainder were cut down by the men-at-arms, who
at once proceeded to hew the machine in pieces with the axes with which they were provided.
Sir Walter himself and his mounted companions dashed forward to the nearer tents of the French
camps, cut down all who opposed them, and setting fire to the huts retired towards the city.

By this time the French were thoroughly alarmed, and numbers of knights and men-at-arms dashed
after the little body of English cavalry. These could have regained the place in safety, but
in the chivalrous spirit of the time they disdained to retire without striking a blow. Turning
their horses, therefore, and laying their lances in rest, they charged the pursuing French.

For a few minutes the conflict was desperate and many on both sides were overthrown; then,
as large reinforcements were continually arriving to the French, Sir Walter called off his
men and retired slowly. On reaching the moat he halted his forces. The knights wheeled and
presented a firm face to the enemy, covering the entrance of their followers into the gate.
The French chivalry thundered down upon the little body, but were met by a storm of arrows
from the archers lining the moat. Many knights were struck through the bars of their vizors
or the joints of their mail. The horses, though defended by iron trappings, fell dead under
them, or, maddened by pain, dashed wildly through the ranks, carrying confusion with them,
and the French commanders, seeing how heavy were their losses, called off their men from the
assault. Sir Walter Manny with his party remained without the gate until the enemy had re-entered
their camp, and then rode into the town amid the acclamations of the inhabitants, the countess
herself meeting her deliverers at the gate and kissing each, one after the other, in token
of her gratitude and admiration.

The arrival of the reinforcements and the proof of skill and vigour given by the English leader,
together with the terror caused by the terrible effect of the English arrows, shook the resolution
of Don Louis and his troops. Deprived of half their force by the absence of Charles of Blois,
it was thought prudent by the leaders to withdraw at once, and the third morning after the
arrival of Sir Walter Manny the siege was raised, and the French marched to join Charles of
Blois before the Castle of Auray.

Even with the reinforcements brought by Sir Walter Manny, the forces of the Countess of Montford
were still so greatly inferior to those of the divisions of the French army that they could
not hope to cope with them in the field until the arrival of the main English army, which the
King of England himself was to bring over shortly. Accordingly the French laid siege to and
captured many small towns and castles. Charles of Blois continued the siege of Auray, and directed
Don Louis with his division to attack the town of Dinan. On his way the Spaniard captured the
small fortress of Conquet and put the garrison to the sword. Sir Walter Manny, in spite of
the inferiority of his force, sallied out to relieve it, but it was taken before his arrival,
and Don Louis had marched away to Dinan, leaving a small garrison in Conquet. It was again
captured by Sir Walter, but finding it indefensible he returned with the whole of his force
to Hennebon. Don Louis captured Dinan and then besieged Guerande. Here he met with a vigorous
resistance, but carried it by storm, and gave it up to be pillaged by his soldiers. He now
sent back to Charles of Blois the greater part of the French troops who accompanied him, and
embarked with the Genoese and Spanish, 8000 in number, and sailed to Quimperle, a rich and
populous town in Lower Brittany.

Anchoring in the River Leita, he disembarked his troops, and leaving a guard to protect the
vessels marched to the interior, plundering and burning, and from time to time despatching
his booty to swell the immense mass which he had brought in his ships from the sack of Guerande.

Quimperle lies but a short distance from Hennebon, and Sir Walter Manny with Almeric de Clisson,
a number of English knights, and a body of English archers, in all three thousand men, embarked
in the ships in the port, and entering the Leita captured the enemy's fleet and all his treasure.
The English then landed, and dividing into three bodies, set out in search of the enemy.

The English columns marched at a short distance apart so as to be able to give each other assistance
in case of attack. The news of the English approach soon reached the Spaniards, who were gathered
in a solid body, for the enraged country people, armed with clubs and bills, hung on their
flanks and cut off any stragglers who left the main body. Don Louis at once moved towards the
sea-coast, and coming in sight of one of the English divisions, charged it with his whole force.

The English fought desperately, but the odds of seven to one were too great, and they would
have been overpowered had not the other two divisions arrived on the spot and fallen upon the
enemy's flanks. After a severe and prolonged struggle the Genoese and Spaniards were completely
routed. The armed peasantry slew every fugitive they could overtake, and of the 7000 men with
whom Don Louis commenced the battle only 300 accompanied him in his flight to Rennes, the troops
of Sir Walter and de Clisson pursuing him to the very gates of that city. Sir Walter marched
back with his force to the ships, but finding the wind unfavourable returned to Hennebon by
land, capturing by the way the castle of Goy la Foret. Their return was joyfully welcomed,
not only for the victory which they had achieved, but because the enemy was again drawing near
to the town. Auray had fallen. The brave garrison, after existing for some time upon the flesh
of their horses, had endeavoured to cut their way through the besiegers. Most of them were
killed in the attempt, but a few escaped and made their way to Hennebon.

Vannes, an important town, and Carhaix quickly surrendered, and the French force was daily
receiving considerable reinforcements. This arose from the fact that large numbers of French
nobles and knights had, with their followers, taken part with Alfonso, King of Castile and
Leon, in his war with the Moors. This had just terminated with the expulsion of the latter
from Spain, and the French knights and nobles on their way home for the most part joined at
once in the war which their countrymen were waging in Bretagne.

Seeing the great force which was gathering for a fresh siege of Hennebon, Sir Walter Manny
and the Countess of Montford sent an urgent message to King Edward for further support. The
king was not yet ready, but at the beginning of August he despatched a force under the command
of the Earl of Northampton and Robert of Artois. It consisted of twenty-seven knights bannerets
and 2000 men-at-arms. Before, however, it could reach Hennebon the second siege of that city
had begun. Charles of Blois had approached it with a far larger army than that with which he
had on the first occasion sat down before it. Hennebon was, however, much better prepared than
at first for resistance. The walls had been repaired, provisions and military stores laid up,
and machines constructed. The garrison was very much larger, and was commanded by one of the
most gallant knights of the age, and the citizens beheld undaunted the approach of the great
French army.

Four days after the French had arrived before Hennebon they were joined by Don Louis, who had
been severely wounded in the fight near Quimperle, and had lain for six weeks at Rennes. Sixteen
great engines at once began to cast stones against the walls, but Sir Walter caused sandbags
to be lowered, and so protected the walls from the attack that little damage was done. The
garrison confident in their powers to resist, taunted the assailants from the walls, and specially
enraged the Spaniards and Don Louis by allusions to the defeat at Quimperle.

So furious did the Spanish prince become that he took a step unprecedented in those days of
chivalry. He one morning entered the tent of Charles of Blois, where a number of French nobles
were gathered, and demanded a boon in requital of all his services. Charles at once assented,
when, to his surprise and horror, Prince Louis demanded that two English knights, Sir John
Butler and Sir Hubert Frisnoy, who had been captured in the course of the campaign and were
kept prisoners at Faouet, should be delivered to him to be executed. "These English," he said,
"have pursued, discomforted, and wounded me, and have killed the nephew whom I loved so well,
and as I have none other mode of vengeance I will cut off their heads before their companions
who lie within those walls."

Charles of Blois and his nobles were struck with amazement and horror at the demand, and used
every means in their power to turn the savage prince from his purpose, but in vain. They pointed
out to him that his name would be dishonoured in all countries where the laws of chivalry prevailed
by such a deed, and besought him to choose some other boon. Don Louis refused to yield, and
Charles of Blois, finding no alternative between breaking his promise and delivering his prisoners,
at last agreed to his request.

The prisoners were sent for, and were informed by Don Louis himself of their approaching end.
At first they could not believe that he was in earnest, for such a proceeding was so utterly
opposed to the spirit of the times that it seemed impossible to them. Finding that he was in
earnest they warned him of the eternal stain which such a deed would bring upon his name. The
Spaniard, however, was unmoved either by their words or by the entreaties of the French nobles
but told them that he would give them a few hours to prepare for death, and that they should
be executed in sight of the walls after the usual dinner hour of the army.

In those days sieges were not conducted in the strict manner in which they are at present,
and non-combatants passed without difficulty to and fro between town and camp. The news, therefore,
of what was intended speedily reached the garrison, whom it filled with indignation and horror.
A council was immediately called, and Sir Walter Manny proposed a plan, which was instantly
adopted.

Without loss of time Almeric de Clisson issued forth from the great gate of Hennebon, accompanied
by 300 men-at-arms and 1000 archers. The latter took post at once along the edge of the ditches.
The men-at-arms rode straight for the enemy's camp, which was undefended, the whole army being
within their tents at dinner. Dashing into their midst the English and Breton men-at-arms began
to overthrow the tents and spear all that were in them. Not knowing the extent of the danger
or the smallness of the attacking force, the French knights sprang up from table, mounted,
and rode to encounter the assailants.

For some time these maintained their ground against all assaults until, finding that the whole
army was upon them, Almeric de Clisson gave order for his troop to retire slowly upon the town.
Fighting every step of the ground and resisting obstinately the repeated onslaught of the French,
Clisson approached the gate. Here he was joined by the archers, who with bent bows prepared
to resist the advance of the French. As it appeared that the garrison were prepared to give
battle outside the walls, the whole French army prepared to move against them.

In the meantime Sir Walter Manny, with 100 men-at-arms and 500 horse archers, issued by a sally-port
on the other side of the town, and with all speed rode round to the rear of the French camp.
There he found none to oppose him save servants and camp-followers, and making his way straight
to the tent of Charles of Blois, where the two knights were confined, he soon freed them from
their bonds. They were mounted without wasting a moment's time upon two spare horses, and turning
again the whole party rode back towards Hennebon, and had reached the postern gate before the
fugitives from the camp reached the French commanders and told them what had happened.

Seeing that he was now too late, because of De Clisson's sortie, Charles of Blois recalled
his army from the attack, in which he could only have suffered heavily from the arrows of the
archers and the missiles from the walls. The same day, he learned from some prisoners captured
in the sortie, of the undiminished spirit of the garrison, and that Hennebon was amply supplied
with provisions brought by sea. His own army was becoming straitened by the scarcity of supplies
in the country round, he therefore determined at once to raise the siege, and to besiege some
place where he would encounter less serious resistance.

Accordingly, next morning he drew off his army and marched to Carhaix.

Shortly afterwards the news came that the Earl of Northampton and Robert of Artois, with their
force, had sailed, and Don Louis, with the Genoese and other Italian mercenaries, started to
intercept them with a large fleet. The fleets met off the island of Guernsey, and a severe
engagement took place, which lasted till night. During the darkness a tremendous storm burst
upon them and the combatants separated. The English succeeded in making their way to Brittany
and landed near Vannes. The Spaniards captured four small ships which had been separated in
the storm from their consorts, but did not succeed in regaining the coast of Brittany, being
driven south by the storm as far as Spain. The Earl of Northampton at once laid siege to Vannes,
and Sir Walter Manny moved with every man that could be spared from Hennebon to assist him.

As it was certain that the French army would press forward with all speed to relieve the town,
it was decided to lose no time in battering the walls, but to attempt to carry it at once by
assault. The walls, however, were so strong that there seemed little prospect of success attending
such an attempt, and a plan was therefore determined upon by which the enemy might be thrown
off their guard. The assault commenced at three points in the early morning and was continued
all day. No great vigour, however, was shown in these attempts which were repulsed at all points.

At nightfall the assailants drew off to their camp, and Oliver de Clisson, who commanded the
town, suffered his weary troops to quit the walls and to seek for refreshment and repose. The
assailants, however, did not disarm, but after a sufficient time had elapsed to allow the garrison
to lay aside their armour two strong parties attacked the principal gates of the town, while
Sir Walter Manny and the Earl of Oxford moved round to the opposite side with ladders for an
escalade. The plan was successful. The garrison, snatching up their arms, hurried to repel
their attack upon the gates, every man hastening in that direction. Sir Walter Manny with his
party were therefore enabled to mount the walls unobserved and make their way into the town;
here they fell upon the defenders in the rear, and the sudden onslaught spread confusion and
terror among them. The parties at the gates forced their way in and joined their friends, and
the whole of the garrison were killed or taken prisoners, save a few, including Oliver Clisson,
who made their escape by sally-ports. Robert of Artois, with the Earl of Stafford, was left
with a garrison to hold the town. The Earl of Salisbury, with four thousand men, proceeded
to lay siege to Rennes, and Sir Walter Manny hastened back to Hennebon.

Some of Sir Walter's men formed part of the garrison of Vannes, and among these was Sir John
Powis with a hundred men-at-arms.

The knight had been so pleased with Walter's coolness and courage at the siege at Hennebon
that he requested Sir Walter to leave him with him at Vannes. "It is possible," he said to
Walter, "that we may have fighting here. Methinks that Sir Walter would have done better to
leave a stronger force. The town is a large one, and the inhabitants ill-disposed towards us.
Oliver Clisson and the French nobles will feel their honour wounded at the way in which we
outwitted them, and will likely enough make an effort to regain the town. However, Rennes and
Hennebon are not far away, and we may look for speedy aid from the Earl of Salisbury and Sir
Walter should occasion arise."

Sir John's previsions were speedily verified. Oliver Clisson and his friends were determined
to wipe out their defeat, and scattered through the country raising volunteers from among the
soldiery in all the neighbouring towns and castles, and a month after Vannes was taken they
suddenly appeared before the town with an army of 12,000 men, commanded by Beaumanoir, marshal
of Bretagne for Charles of Blois. The same reasons which had induced the Earl of Northampton
to decide upon a speedy assault instead of the slow process of breaching the walls, actuated
the French in pursuing the same course, and, divided into a number of storming parties, the
army advanced at once to the assault on the walls. The little garrison prepared for the defence.

"The outlook is bad, Walter," Sir John Powis said. "These men approach with an air of resolution
which shows that they are bent upon success. They outnumber us by twelve to one, and it is
likely enough that the citizens may rise and attack us in the rear. They have been ordered
to bring the stones for the machines to the walls, but no one has laid his hand to the work.
We must do our duty as brave men, my lad, but I doubt me if yonder is not the last sun which
we shall see. Furious as the French are at our recent success here you may be sure that little
quarter will given."

CHAPTER X: A PLACE OF REFUGE

The French, excited to the utmost by the exhortations of their commanders, and by their desire
to wipe out the disgrace of the easy capture of Vannes by the English, advanced with ardour
to the assault, and officers and men vied with each other in the valour which they displayed.
In vain did the garrison shower arrows and cross-bow bolts among them, and pour down burning
oil and quicklime upon them as they thronged at the foot of the wall. In vain were the ladders,
time after time, hurled back loaded with men upon the mass below. The efforts of the men-at-arms
to scale the defences were seconded by their archers and crossbow-men, who shot such a storm
of bolts that great numbers of the defenders were killed. The assault was made at a score of
different points, and the garrison was too weak to defend all with success. Sir John Powis
and his party repulsed over and over again the efforts of the assailants against that part
of the wall entrusted to them, but at other points the French gained a footing, and swarming
up rushed along the walls, slaying all whom they encountered.

"All is lost," Sir John exclaimed; "let us fall back to the castle and die fighting there."

Descending from the wall the party made their way through the streets. The French were already
in the town; every house was closed and barred, and from the upper windows the burghers hurled
down stones and bricks upon the fugitives, while parties of the French soldiers fell upon them
fiercely. Many threw down their arms and cried for quarter, but were instantly slain.

For a while the streets were a scene of wild confusion; here and there little knots of Englishmen
stood together and defended themselves until the last, others ran through the streets chased
by their exulting foes, some tried in vain to gain shelter in the houses. Sir John Powis's
band was soon broken and scattered, and their leader slain by a heavy stone from a housetop.
Walter fought his way blindly forward towards the castle although he well knew that no refuge
would be found there. Ralph Smith kept close beside him, levelling many of his assailants with
the tremendous blows of a huge mace. Somehow, Walter hardly knew how, they made their way through
their assailants and dashed in at the castle gate. A crowd of their assailants were close upon
their heels. Walter glanced round; dashing across the courtyard he ran through some passages
into an inner yard, in which, as he knew, was the well. The bucket hung at the windlass.

"Catch hold, Ralph!" he exclaimed; "there is just a chance, and we may as well be drowned as
killed." They grasped the rope and jumped off. The bucket began to descend with frightful velocity.
Faster and faster it went and yet it seemed a long time before they plunged into the water,
which was nigh a hundred feet below the surface. Fortunately the rope was considerably longer
than was necessary, and they sank many feet into the water, still retaining their hold. Then
clinging to the rope they hauled themselves to the surface.

"We cannot hold on here five minutes," Ralph exclaimed, "my armour is dragging me down."

"We will soon get rid of that," Walter said.

"There go our helmets; now I will hold on with one hand and help you to unbuckle your breast
and back pieces; you do the same for me."

With great efforts they managed to rid themselves of their armour, and then held on with ease
to the rope. They hauled the bucket to the surface and tied a knot in the slack of the rope,
so that the bucket hung four feet below the level of the water. Putting their feet in this,
they were able to stand with their heads above the surface without difficulty.

"This is a nice fix," Ralph exclaimed. "I think it would have been just as well to have been
killed at once. They are sure to find us here, and if they don't we shall die of cold before
tomorrow morning."

"I don't think they will find us," Walter said cheerfully. "When they have searched the castle
thoroughly it may occur to some of them that we have jumped down the well, but it will be no
particular business of anyone to look for us, and they will all be too anxious to get at the
wine butts to trouble their heads about the matter; besides, it must be a heavy job to wind
up this bucket, and it is not likely there will be such urgent need of water that anyone will
undertake the task."

"But we are no better off if they don't," Ralph remarked, "for we must die here if we are not
hauled out. I suppose you don't intend to try and climb that rope. I might do twenty feet or
so on a pinch, but I could no more get up to the top there than I could fly."

"We must think it over," Walter rejoined; "where there is a will there is a way, you know.
We will take it by turns to watch that little patch of light overhead; if we see anyone looking
down we must leave the bucket and swim to the side without making the least noise. They may
give a few turns of the windlass to see if anyone has hold of the rope below; be sure you do
not make the slightest splashing or noise, for the sound would be heard above to a certainty."

Ten minutes later they saw two heads appear above, and instantly withdrew their feet from the
bucket and made a stroke to the side, which was but four feet distant, being careful as they
did that no motion was imparted to the rope. Then though it was too dark to see anything, they
heard the bucket lifted from the water. A minute later it fell back again with a splash, then
all was quiet.

"We are safe now, and can take our place in the bucket. They are satisfied that if we did jump
down here we are drowned. And now we must think about climbing up."

"Aye, that will require a good deal of thinking," Ralph grumbled.

For some time there was silence; then Walter said, "The first thing to do is to cut off the
slack of the rope, there are some twelve feet of it. Then we will unwind the strands of that.
There are five or six large strands as far as I can feel; we will cut them up into lengths
of about a couple of feet and we ought to be able to tie these to the rope in such a way as
not to slip down with our weight. If we tie them four feet apart we can go up step by step;
I don't see much difficulty about that."

"No," Ralph said much more cheerfully, "I should think that we could manage that."

They at once set to work. The rope was cut up and unravelled, and the strands cut into pieces
about two feet long. They then both set to work trying to discover some way of fastening it
by which it would not slip down the rope. They made many fruitless attempts; each time that
a strand was fastened with a loop large enough for them to pass a leg through, it slid down
the rope when their weight was applied to it. At last they succeeded in finding out a knot
which would hold. This was done by tying a knot close to one end of a piece of the strand,
then sufficient was left to form the loop, and the remainder was wound round the rope in such
a way that the weight only served to tighten its hold.

"Shall we begin at once?" Ralph said, when success was achieved.

"No, we had better wait until nightfall. The vibration of the rope when our weight once gets
on it might be noticed by anyone crossing the courtyard."

"Do you think we have sufficient bits of rope," Ralph asked.

"Just enough, I think," Walter replied; "there were six strands, and each has made six pieces,
so we have thirty-six. I know the well is about a hundred feet deep, for the other day I heard
some of the soldiers who were drawing water grumbling over the labour required. So if we put
them three feet apart it will take thirty-three of them, which will leave three over; but we
had better place them a little over a yard so as to make sure."

In a short time the fading brightness of the circle of light far overhead told them that twilight
had commenced, and shortly afterwards they attached the first strand to the rope some three
feet above the water.

"Now," Walter said, "I will go first, at any rate for a time. I must put one leg through the
loop, and sit, as it were, while I fasten the one above, as I shall want both hands for the
work. You will find it a good deal easier to stand with your foot in the loop. If I get tired
I will fasten another loop by the side of that on which I am resting, so you can come up and
pass me. There is no hurry. It ought not to take up above an hour, and it will not do for us
to get to the top until the place becomes a little quiet. Tonight they are sure to be drinking
and feasting over their victory until late."

They now set to work, and step by step mounted the rope. They found the work less arduous than
they had expected. The rope was dry, and the strands held tightly to it. Two or three times
they changed places, resting in turn from the work; but in less than two hours from the time
they made the first loop Walter's head and shoulders appeared above the level of the courtyard.
He could hear sounds of shouting and singing within the castle, and knew that a great feast
was going on. Descending a step or two he held parley with Ralph.

"I think, perhaps, it will be better to sally out at once. Everyone is intent on his own pleasure,
and we shall have no difficulty in slipping out of the castle unnoticed. All will be feasting
and riot in the town, and so long as we do not brush against any one so that they may feel
our wet garments we are little likely to be noticed; besides, the gates of the town will stand
open late, for people from the villages round will have come in to join in the revels."

"I am ready to try it, Master Walter," Ralph replied, "for I ache from head to foot with holding
on to this rope. The sooner the better, say I."

In another minute both stood in the courtyard. It was a retired spot, and none were passing.
Going along the passage they issued into the main yard. Here great fires were blazing, and
groups of men sat round them drinking and shouting. Many lay about in drunken sleep.

"Stay where you are in the shade, Ralph. You had best lie down by the foot of the wall. Anyone
who passes will think that you are in a drunken sleep. I will creep forward and possess myself
of the steel caps of two of these drunkards, and if I can get a couple of cloaks so much the
better."

There was no difficulty about the caps, and by dint of unbuckling the cloaks and rolling their
wearers gently over, Walter succeeded at last in obtaining two of them. He also picked up a
sword for Ralph--his own still hung in its sheath--and then he joined his companion, and the
two putting on the steel caps and cloaks walked quietly to the gate. There were none on guard,
and they issued unmolested into the town. Here all was revelry. Bonfires blazed in the streets.
Hogsheads of wine, with the heads knocked out, stood before many of the houses for all to help
themselves who wished. Drunken soldiers reeled along shouting snatches of songs, and the burghers
in the highest state of hilarity thronged the ways.

"First of all, Ralph, we will have a drink of wine, for I am chilled to the bone."

"Aye, and so am I," Ralph replied. "I got hot enough climbing that rope, but now the cold has
got hold of me again, and my teeth are chattering in my head."

Picking up one of the fallen vessels by a cask they dipped it in and took a long draught of
wine; then, turning off from the principal streets, they made their way by quiet lanes down
to one of the gates. To their dismay they found that this was closed. The French commanders
knew that Sir Walter Manny or Salisbury might ere this be pressing forward to relieve the town,
and that, finding that it had fallen, they might attempt to recapture it by a sudden attack.
While permitting therefore the usual licence, after a successful assault, to the main body
of their forces, they had placed a certain number of their best troops on the walls, giving
them a handsome largess to make up for their loss of the festivities.

At first Walter and his friend feared that their retreat was cut off for the night, but several
other people presently arrived, and the officer on guard said, coming out, "You must wait a
while; the last batch have only just gone, and I cannot keep opening and closing the gate;
in half an hour I will let you out."

Before that time elapsed some fifty or sixty people, anxious to return to their villages, gathered
round the gate.

"Best lay aside your steel cap, Ralph, before we join them," Walter said. "In the dim light
of that lamp none will notice that we have head-gear, but if it were to glint upon the steel
cap the officer might take us for deserters and question us as to who we are."

Presently the officer came out from the guard-room again. There was a forward movement of the
little crowd, and Walter and Ralph closed in to their midst. The gates were opened, and without
any question the villagers passed out, and the gates were shut instantly behind them.

Walter and his comrade at once started at a brisk pace and walked all night in the direction
of Hennebon. Their clothes soon dried, and elated at their escape from danger they struggled
on briskly. When morning broke they entered a wood, and lay there till evening, as they feared
to continue their journey lest they might fall into the hands of some roving band of French
horse. They were, too, dog-tired, and were asleep a few minutes after they lay down. The sun
was setting when they awoke, and as soon as it was dark they resumed their journey.

"I don't know what you feel, Master Walter, but I am well-nigh famished. It is thirty-six hours
since I swallowed a bit of food, just as the French were moving to the attack. Hard blows I
don't mind--I have been used to it; but what with fighting, and being in the water for five
or six hours, and climbing up that endless rope, and walking all night on an empty stomach,
it does not suit me at all."

"I feel ravenous too, Ralph, but there is no help for it. We shall eat nothing till we are
within the walls of Hennebon, and that will be by daylight tomorrow if all goes well. Draw
your belt an inch or two tighter, it will help to keep out the wolf."

They kept on all night, and in the morning saw to their delight the towers of Hennebon in the
distance. It was well that it was no further, for both were so exhausted from want of food
that they could with difficulty drag their legs along.

Upon entering the town Walter made his way at once to the quarters of the leader. Sir Walter
had just risen, and was delighted at the sight of his esquire.

"I had given you up for dead," he exclaimed. "By what miracle could you have escaped? Are you
alone?"

"I have with me only my faithful follower Ralph Smith, who is below; but, Sir Walter, for mercy's
sake order that some food be placed before us, or we shall have escaped from the French only
to die of hunger here. We have tasted nought since the attack on Vannes began. Have any beside
us escaped?"

"Lord Stafford contrived, with two or three others, to cut their way out by a postern-gate,
bringing with them Robert of Artois, who is grievously wounded. None others, save you and your
man-at-arms, have made their way here."

In a few minutes a cold capon, several manchets of bread, and a stoop of wine were placed before
Walter, while Ralph's wants were attended to below. When he had satisfied his hunger the young
esquire related his adventures to Sir Walter and several other knights and nobles, who had
by this time gathered in the room.

"In faith, Master Somers, you have got well out of your scrape," Sir Walter exclaimed. "Had
I been in your place I should assuredly have perished, for I would a thousand times rather
meet death sword in hand, than drop down into the deep hole of that well. And your brains served
you shrewdly in devising a method of escape. What say you, gentlemen?"

All present joined in expressions of praise at the lad's coolness and presence of mind.

"You are doing well, young sir," the English leader went on, "and have distinguished yourself
on each occasion on which we have been engaged. I shall be proud when the time comes to bestow
upon you myself the order of knighthood if our king does not take the matter off my hands."

A little later Robert of Artois died of his wounds and disappointment at the failure of his hopes.

In October King Edward himself set sail with a great army, and landing in Brittany early in
November marched forward through the country and soon reduced Ploermel, Malestrail, Redon,
and the rest of the province in the vicinity of Vannes, and then laid siege to that town. As
his force was far more than sufficient for the siege, the Earls of Norfolk and Warwick were
despatched in the direction of Nantes to reconnoitre the country and clear it of any small
bodies of the enemy they might encounter. In the meantime Edward opened negotiations with many
of the Breton lords, who, seeing that such powerful aid had arrived for the cause of the Countess
of Montford, were easily persuaded to change sides. Among them were the lords of Clisson, Moheac,
Machecoul, Retz, and many others of less importance.

The Count of Valentinois, who commanded the garrison of Vannes, supported the siege with great
courage and fortitude, knowing that Charles of Blois and the King of France were collecting
a great army for his relief. Uniting their forces they advanced towards the town. Before the
force of the French, 40,000 strong, the Earl of Norfolk had fallen back and rejoined the king,
but even after this junction the French forces exceeded those of Edward fourfold. They advanced
towards Vannes and formed a large entrenched camp near that of the English, who thus, while
still besieging Vannes, were themselves enclosed by a vastly superior force. The King of France
himself arrived at the French camp. The French, although so greatly superior, made no motion
toward attacking the English, but appeared bent upon either starving them out or forcing them
to attack the strongly entrenched position occupied by the French.

Provisions were indeed running short in the English camp, and the arrival of supplies from
England was cut off by a strong fleet under Don Louis, which cruised off the coast and captured
all vessels arriving with stores. At this moment two legates, the Cardinal Bishop of Preneste
and the Cardinal Bishop of Tusculum, arrived from the pope and strove to mediate between the
two sovereigns and to bring about a cessation of hostilities, pointing out to them the scandal
and desolation which their rivalry caused in Christendom, the waste of noble lives, the devastation
of once happy provinces, and the effusion of innocent blood. Going from camp to camp they exhorted,
prayed, and reproached the rival sovereigns, urging that while Christians were shedding each
other's blood in vain, the infidels were daily waxing bolder and more insolent. Their arguments
would have been but of little use had either of the monarchs felt sure of victory. King Edward,
however, felt that his position was growing desperate, for starvation was staring him in the
face, and only by a victory over an immensely superior force in a strongly entrenched position
could he extricate himself. Upon the part of the French, however, circumstances were occurring
which rendered them anxious for a release from their position, for they were not without their
share of suffering. While the English army lay on a hill the French camp was pitched on low
ground. An unusually wet season had set in with bitterly cold wind. The rain was incessant,
a pestilence had destroyed a vast number of their horses, and their encampment was flooded.
Their forces were therefore obligated to spread themselves over the neighbouring fields, and
a sudden attack by the English might have been fatal.

Thus distress pressed upon both commanders, and the pope's legates found their exertions at
last crowned with success. A suspension of hostilities was agreed to, and the Dukes of Burgundy
and Bourbon on the one side and the Earls of Lancaster, Northampton, and Salisbury on the other,
met as commissioners and agreed to a convention by which a general truce was to be made from
the date of the treaty to the following Michaelmas, and to be prolonged from that day for the
full term of three years. It was agreed that the truce should embrace not only the sovereigns,
but all the adherents of each of them. The truce was to hold good in Brittany between all parties,
and the city of Vannes was to be given into the hands of the cardinals to dispose of as they
chose. It was specially provided that in the case of any of the adherents of either party in
the Duchies of Gascony and Brittany waging war against each other, neither of the monarchs
should either directly or indirectly meddle therewith, nor should the truce be at all broken
thereby.

Immediately the treaty was signed, on the 19th of January, 1343, the King of France dismissed
his army, and Edward sailed for England with the greater part of his troops. The Countess of
Montford and her son accompanied him, and the possessions of her husband in Brittany were left
to the guardianship of her partisans, with a small but choice body of English troops.

The towns which had fallen into their hands and still remained were Brest, Quimper-Corentin,
Quimperle, Redon, and Guerande; Vannes was handed over to them by the cardinals, and Hennebon,
of course, remained in their possession.

Walter returned to England with Sir Walter Manny, and on reaching London was received with
delight by his old friends Geoffrey Ward and Giles Fletcher, who were never tired of listening
to his tales of the wars. Dame Vernon also received him with great kindness, and congratulated
him warmly upon the very favourable account which Sir Walter Manny had given of his zeal and
gallantry.

The time now for a while passed very quietly. Walter and the other young squires practised
diligently, under the instructions of Sir Walter, at knightly exercises. Walter learned to
bear himself well on horseback and to tilt in the ring. He was already a skilful swordsman,
but he spared no pains to improve himself with his weapons. The court was a gay one, and Walter,
as a favoured esquire of one of the foremost knights there, was admitted to all that took place.
His courtly education, of course, included dancing, and when he went down, as he often did,
for a long chat with his old friends, Geoffrey often said, laughing, that he was growing such
a fine gentleman that he hardly liked to sit in his presence; but although changed in manner,
Walter continued to be, as before, a frank, manly young fellow, and free from the affectations
which were so general among the young men of the court.

CHAPTER XI: A STORMY INTERVIEW

Soon after Walter's return from France Dame Vernon returned to her country estate, and a year
passed before he again saw her. During this time the truce which had been established between
England and France had remained unbroken. It was certain, however, that ere long the two powers
would again come to blows. The King of England had honourably observed the terms of the treaty.
Upon his return home he had entirely disbanded his army and had devoted his whole attention
to increasing the trade and prosperity of the country. The measures which he took to do this
were not always popular with the people of England, for seeing how greatly they excelled the
English manufacturers Edward encouraged large numbers of Flemings and other foreign workmen
to settle in London, and gave them many privileges to induce them to do so; this the populace
strongly resented. There was a strong ill feeling against the Flemings and serious popular
riots took place, for the English traders and workmen considered that these foreigners were
taking the bread from their mouths. The king, however, was wiser than his people, he saw that
although the English weavers were able to produce coarse cloths, yet that all of the finer
sort had to be imported from the Continent. He deemed that in time the Flemings would teach
their art to his subjects, and that England would come to vie with the Low Countries in the
quality of her produce. Such was indeed afterwards the case, and England gained greatly by
the importation of the industrious Flemings, just as she afterwards profited from the expulsion
from France of tens of thousands of Protestant workmen who brought here many of the manufactures
of which France had before the monopoly. The relations between England and the Flemings were
at this time very close, for the latter regarded England as her protector against the ambition
of the King of France.

But while King Edward had laid aside all thought of war, such was not the case with Phillip
of Valois. He had retired after the signature of the treaty full of rage and humiliation; for
hitherto in all their struggles his English rival had had the better of him, and against vastly
superior forces had foiled all his efforts and had gained alike glory and military advantage.
King Edward had hardly set sail when Phillip began to break the terms of truce by inciting
the adherents of Charles of Blois to attack those of De Montford, and by rendering assistance
to them with money and men. He also left no means untried to detach Flanders from its alliance
with England. Several castles and towns in Brittany were wrested from the partisans of De Montford,
and King Edward, after many remonstrances at the breaches of the conditions of the truce, began
again to make preparations for taking the field. Several brilliant tournaments were held and
every means were taken to stir up the warlike spirit of the people.

One day Walter had attended his lord to the palace and was waiting in the anteroom with many
other squires and gentlemen, while Sir Walter, with some other noblemen, was closeted with
the king, discussing the means to be adopted for raising funds for a renewal of a war with
France, when a knight entered whom Walter had not previously seen at court.

"Who is that?" he asked one of his acquaintances; "methinks I know his face, though it passes
my memory to say where I have seen it."

"He has been away from England for some two years," his friend answered. "That is Sir James
Carnegie; he is a cousin of the late Sir Jasper Vernon; he left somewhat suddenly a short time
after Dame Vernon had that narrow escape from drowning that you wot of; he betook himself then
to Spain, where he has been fighting the Moors; he is said to be a valiant knight, but otherwise
he bears but an indifferent good reputation."

Walter remembered the face now; it was that of the knight he had seen enter the hut of the
river pirate on the Lambeth marshes. When released from duty he at once made his way to the
lodging of Dame Vernon. Walter was now nineteen, for a year had elapsed since the termination
of the French war, and he was in stature and strength the match of most men, while his skill
at knightly exercises, as well as with the sword, was recognized as pre-eminent among all the
young esquires of the court.

After the first greeting he said to Dame Vernon: "I think it right to tell you, lady, that
I have but now, in the king's anteroom, seen the man who plotted against your life in the hut
at Lambeth. His face is a marked one and I could not mistake it. I hear that he is a cousin
of yours, one Sir James Carnegie, as you doubtless recognized from my description of him. I
came to tell you in order that you might decide what my conduct should be. If you wish it so
I will keep the secret in my breast; but if you fear aught from him I will openly accuse him
before the king of the crime he attempted, and shall be ready to meet him in the ordeal of
battle should he claim it."

"I have seen Sir James," Lady Vernon said. "I had a letter writ in a feigned hand telling him
that his handiwork in the plot against my life was known, and warning him that, unless he left
England, the proofs thereof would be laid before justice. He at once sailed for Spain, whence,
he has returned but a few days since. He does not know for certain that I am aware of his plottings
against us; but he must have seen by my reception of him when he called that I no longer regard
him with the friendship which I formerly entertained. I have received a message from him that
he will call upon me this evening, and that he trusts he will find me alone, as he would fain
confer with me on private matters. When I have learned his intentions I shall be the better
able to judge what course I had best adopt. I would fain, if it may be, let the matter rest.
Sir James has powerful interest, and I would not have him for an open enemy if I can avoid
it; besides, all the talk and publicity which so grave an accusation against a knight, and
he of mine own family, would entail, would be very distasteful to me; but should I find it
necessary for the sake of my child, I shall not shrink from it. I trust, however, that it will
not come to that; but I shall not hesitate, if need be, to let him know that I am acquainted
with his evil designs towards us. I will inform you of as much of our interview as it is necessary
that you should know."

That evening Sir James Carnegie called upon Dame Vernon. I had a period. "Her become husky, ferment

Ralph of course followed Walter's fortunes, and was now brilliant in the appointments of the
Prince of Wales's chosen bodyguard of men-at-arms.

The councils of all the great towns of Flanders assembled at Sluys, and for several days great
festivities were held. Then a great assembly was held, and Van Artevelde rose and addressed
his countrymen. He set forth to them the virtues of the Prince of Wales, whose courtesy and
bearing had so captivated them; he pointed out the obligations which Flanders was under towards
King Edward, and the advantages which would arise from a nearer connection with England. With
this he contrasted the weakness of their count, the many ills which his adherence to France
had brought upon the country, and the danger which menaced them should his power be ever renewed.
He then boldly proposed to them that they should at once cast off their allegiance to the count
and bestow the vacant coronet upon the Prince of Wales, who, as Duke of Flanders, would undertake
the defence and government of the country with the aid of a Flemish council. This wholly unexpected
proposition took the Flemish burghers by surprise. Artevelde had calculated upon his eloquence
and influence carrying them away, but his power had diminished, and many of his hearers had
already been gained to the cause of France. The burgher councils had for a long time had absolute
power in their own towns, and the prospect of a powerful prince at their head foredoomed a
curtailment of those powers. When Artevelde ceased, therefore, instead of the enthusiastic
shouts with which he hoped his oration would be greeted, a confused murmur arose. At last several
got up and said that, greatly attached as they were to the king, much as they admired the noble
young prince proposed for their acceptance, they felt themselves unable to give an answer upon
an affair of such moment without consulting their fellow countrymen and learning their opinions.
They therefore promised that they would return on a certain day and give a decided answer.

The Flemish burghers then took their leave. Van Artevelde, after a consultation with the king,
started at once to use his influence among the various towns.

After leaving the king he bade adieu to the Prince of Wales. "Would you like," the young prince
said, "that one of my esquires should ride with you? His presence might show the people how
entirely I am with you; and should you have tidings to send me he could ride hither with them.
I have one with me who is prudent and wise, and who possesses all the confidence of that wise
and valiant knight, Sir Walter de Manny."

"I will gladly take him, your royal highness," Van Artevelde said, "and hope to despatch him
to you very shortly with the news that the great towns of Flanders all gladly receive you as
their lord."

In a few minutes Walter had mounted his horse, accompanied by Ralph, and, joining Van Artevelde,
rode to Bruges. Here and at Ypres Van Artevelde's efforts were crowned with success. His eloquence
carried away the people with him, and both these cities agreed to accept the Prince of Wales
as their lord; but the hardest task yet remained. Ghent was the largest and most powerful of
the Flemish towns, and here his enemies were in the ascendant. Gerard Denis and the weavers
had been stirring up the people against him. All kinds of accusations had been spread, and
he was accused of robbing and selling his country. The news of the hostile feeling of the population
reached Van Artevelde, and he despatched Walter with the request to the king for a force of
five hundred English soldiers as a guard against his enemies.

Had Artevelde asked for a large force, Edward would have disembarked his army and marched at
their head into Ghent. As the rest of the country was already won, there can be little doubt
that this step would at once have silenced all opposition, and would have annexed Flanders
to the British crown. Van Artevelde, however, believed himself to be stronger than he really
was, and thought with a small party of soldiers he could seize his principal opponents, and
that the people would then rally round him.

Upon the arrival of the five hundred men he started for Ghent; but as he feared that the gates
would be shut if he presented himself with an armed force, he left the soldiers in concealment
a short distance from the town and entered it, accompanied only by his usual suite. At his
invitation, however, Walter, followed of course by Ralph, rode beside him. No sooner was he
within the gates than Van Artevelde saw how strong was the popular feeling against him. He
had been accustomed to be received with bows of reverence; now men turned aside as he approached,
or scowled at him from their doors.

"Methinks, sir," Walter said, "that it would be wiser did we ride back, and, joining the soldiers,
enter at their head, or as that number would be scarce sufficient should so large a town rise
in tumult, to send to King Edward for a larger force and await their coming. Even should they
shut the gates, we can reduce the town, and as all the rest of Flanders is with you, surely
a short delay will not matter."

"You know not these Flemings as well as I do," Van Artevelde replied; "they are surly dogs,
but they always listen to my voice, and are ready enough to do my bidding. When I once speak
to them you will see how they will smooth their backs and do as I ask them."

Walter said no more, but as he saw everywhere lowering brows from window and doorway as they
rode through the streets he had doubts whether the power of Van Artevelde's eloquence would
have the magical potency he had expected from it.

When the party arrived at the splendid dwelling of the great demagogue, messengers were instantly
sent out to all his friends and retainers. A hundred and forty persons soon assembled, and
while Van Artevelde was debating with them as to the best steps to be taken, Walter opened
the casement and looked out into the street. It was already crowded with the people, whose
silent and quiet demeanor seemed to bode no good. Arms were freely displayed among them, and
Walter saw men passing to and fro evidently giving instructions.

"I am sorry to disturb you, Master Artevelde," he said, returning to the room where the council
was being held, "but methinks that it would wise to bar the doors and windows, and to put yourself
in a posture of defence, for a great crowd is gathering without, for the most part armed, and
as it seems to me with evil intentions."

A glance from the windows confirmed Walter's statements, and the doors and windows were speedily
barricaded. Before many minutes had elapsed the tolling of bells in all parts of the town was
heard, and down the different streets leading towards the building large bodies of armed men
were seen making their way.

"I had rather have to do with a whole French army, Master Walter," Ralph said, as he stood
beside him at an upper window looking down upon the crowd, "than with these citizens of Ghent.
Look at those men with bloody axes and stained clothes. Doubtless those are the skinners and
butchers. Didst ever see such a ferocious band of savages? Listen to their shouts. Death to
Van Artevelde! Down with the English alliance! I thought our case was a bad one when the French
poured over the walls into Vannes but methinks it is a hundred times worse now.

"We got out of that scrape, Ralph, and I hope we shall get out of this, but, as you say, the
prospect is black enough. See, the butchers are hammering at the door with their pole-axes.
Let us go down and aid in the defence."

"I am ready," Ralph said, "but I shall fight with a lighter heart if you could fix upon some
plan for us to adopt when the rabble break in. That they will do so I regard as certain, seeing
that the house is not built for purposes of defence, but has numerous broad windows on the
ground-floor by which assuredly they will burst their way in.

"Wait a moment then, Ralph; let us run up to the top storey and see if there be any means of
escape along the roofs."

The house stood detached from the others, but on one side was separated from that next to it
only by a narrow lane, and as the upper stories projected beyond those below, the windows were
but six feet distant from those on the opposite side of the way.

"See," Water said, "there is a casement in the room to our left there which is open; let us
see if it is tenanted."

Going into the next room they went to the window and opened it. It exactly faced the casement
opposite, and so far as they could see the room was unoccupied.

"It were easy to put a plank across," Ralph said.

"We must not do that," Walter answered. "The mob are thick in the lane below--what a roar comes
up from their voices!--and a plank would be surely seen, and we should be killed there as well
as here. No, we must get on to the sill and spring across; the distance is not great, and the
jump would be nothing were it not that the casements are so low. It must be done as lightly
and quickly as possible, and we may not then be seen from below. Now leave the door open that
we may make no mistake as to the room, and come along, for by the sound the fight is hot below."

Running down the stairs Walter and Ralph joined in the defence. Those in the house knew that
they would meet with no mercy from the infuriated crowd, and each fought with the bravery of
despair. Although there were many windows to be defended, and at each the mob attacked desperately,
the assaults were all repulsed. Many indeed of the defenders were struck down by the pikes
and pole-axes, but for a time they beat back the assailants whenever they attempted to enter.
The noise was prodigious. The alarm-bells of the town were all ringing and the shouts of the
combatants were drowned in the hoarse roar of the surging crowd without.

Seeing that however valiant was the defence the assailants must in the end prevail, and feeling
sure that his enemies would have closed the city gates and thus prevented the English without
from coming to his assistance, Van Artevelde ascended to an upper storey and attempted to address
the crowd. His voice was drowned in the roar. In vain he gesticulated and made motions imploring
them to hear him, but all was useless, and the courage of the demagogue deserted him and he
burst into tears at the prospect of death. Then he determined to try and make his escape to
the sanctuary of a church close by, and was descending the stairs when a mighty crash below,
the clashing of steel, shouts, and cries, told that the mob had swept away one of the barricades
and were pouring into the house.

"Make for the stair," Walter shouted, "and defend yourselves there." But the majority of the
defenders, bewildered by the inrush of the enemy, terrified at their ferocious aspect and terrible
axes, had no thought of continuing the resistance. A few, getting into corners, resisted desperately
to the end; others threw down their arms and dropping on their knees cried for mercy, but all
were ruthlessly slaughtered.

Keeping close together Walter and Ralph fought their way to the foot of the stairs, and closely
pursued by a band of the skinners headed by Gerard Denis, ran up. Upon the first landing stood
a man paralysed with terror. On seeing him a cry of ferocious triumph rose from the mob. As
nothing could be done to aid him Walter and his follower rushed by without stopping. There
was a pause in the pursuit, and glancing down from the upper gallery Walter saw Van Artevelde
in the hands of the mob, each struggling to take possession of him; then a man armed with a
great axe pushed his way among them, and swinging it over his head struck Van Artevelde dead
to the floor. His slayer was Gerard Denis himself.

Followed by Ralph, Walter sprang through the open door into the chamber they had marked, and
closed the door behind them. Then Walter, saying, "I will go first, Ralph, I can help you in
should you miss your spring," mounted on the sill of the casement. Short as was the distance
the leap was extremely difficult, for neither casement was more than three feet high. Walter
was therefore obliged to stoop low and to hurl himself head forwards across the gulf. He succeeded
in the attempt, shooting clear through the casement on to the floor beyond. Instantly he picked
himself up and went to Ralph's assistance. The latter, taller and more bulky, had greater difficulty
in the task, and only his shoulder arrived through the window. Walter seized him, and aided
him at once to scramble in, and they closed the casement behind them.

"It was well we took off our armour, Ralph; its pattern would have been recognized in an instant."

Walter had thrown off his helmet as he bounded up the stairs, and both he and his companion
had rid themselves of their heavy armour.

"I would give a good deal," he said, "for two bourgeois jerkins, even were they as foul as
those of the skinners. This is a woman's apartment," he added, looking round, "and nothing
here will cover my six feet of height, to say nothing of your four inches extra. Let us peep
into some of the other rooms. This is, doubtless, the house of some person of importance, and
in the upper floor we may find some clothes of servants or retainers."

They were not long in their search. The next room was a large one, and contained a number of
pallet beds, and hanging from pegs on walls were jerkins, mantles, and other garments, evidently
belonging to the retainers of the house. Walter and Ralph were not long in transmogrifying
their appearance, and had soon the air of two respectable serving-men in a Flemish household.

"But how are we to descend?" Ralph asked. "We can hardly hope to walk down the stairs and make
our escape without being seen, especially as the doors will all be barred and bolted, seeing
the tumult which is raging outside."

"It all depends whether our means of escape are suspected," Walter replied, "I should scarce
think that they would be. The attention of our pursuers was wholly taken up by Van Artevelde,
and some minutes must have passed before they followed us. No doubt they will search every
place in the house, and all within it will by this time have been slaughtered. But they will
scarce organize any special search for us. All will be fully occupied with the exciting events
which have taken place, and as the casement by which we entered is closed it is scarcely likely
to occur to any one that we have escaped by that means. I will listen first if the house is
quiet. If so, we will descend and take refuge in some room below, where there is a better chance
of concealment than here. Put the pieces of armour into that closet so that they may not catch
the eye of any who may happen to come hither. The day is already closing. In half an hour it
will be nightfall. Then we will try and make our way out."

Listening at the top of the stairs they could hear voices below; but as the gallery was quiet
and deserted they made their way a floor lower, and seeing an open door entered it. Walter
looked from the window.

"There is a back-yard below," he said, "with a door opening upon a narrow lane. We are now
upon the second storey, and but some twenty-five feet above the ground. We will not risk going
down through the house, which could scarce be accomplished without detection, but will at once
tear up into strips the coverings of the bed, and I will make a rope by which we may slip down
into the courtyard as soon as it is dark. We must hope that none will come up before that time;
but, indeed, all will be so full of the news of the events which have happened that it is scarce
likely that any will come above at present."

The linen sheets and coverings were soon cut up and knotted together in a rope. By the time
that this was finished the darkness was closing in, and after waiting patiently for a few minutes
they lowered the rope and slid down into the yard. Quietly they undid the bolts of the gate
and issued into the lane. The mantles were provided with hoods, as few of the lower class of
Flemings wore any other head-covering.

Drawing these hoods well over their heads so as to shade their faces the two sallied out from
the lane. They were soon in one of the principal streets, which was crowded with people. Bands
of weavers, butchers, skinners, and others were parading the streets shouting and singing in
honour of their victory and of the downfall and death of him whom they had but a few days before
regarded as the mainstay of Flanders. Many of the better class of burghers stood in groups
in the streets and talked in low and rather frightened voices of the consequences which the
deed of blood would bring upon the city. On the one hand Edward might march upon it with his
army to avenge the murder of his ally. Upon the other hand they were now committed to France.
Their former ruler would return, and all the imposts and burdens against which they had rebelled
would again be laid upon the city.

"What shall we do now?" Ralph asked, "for assuredly there will be no issue by the gates."

"We must possess ourselves of a length of rope if possible, and make our escape over the wall.
How to get one I know not, for the shops are all closed, and even were it not so I could not
venture in to purchase any, for my speech would betray us at once. Let us separate, and each
see whether he can find what we want. We will meet again at the entrance to this church in
an hour's time. One or other of us may find what we seek."

Walter searched in vain. Wherever he saw the door of a yard open he peered in, but in no case
could he see any signs of rope. At the end of the hour he returned to their rendezvous. Ralph
was already there.

"I have found nothing, Ralph. Have you had better fortune?"

"That have I, Master Walter, and was back nigh an hour since. Scarce had I left you when in
a back street I came upon a quiet hostelry, and in the courtyard were standing half a dozen
teams of cattle. Doubtless their owners had brought hay or corn into the city, and when the
tumult arose and the gates were closed found themselves unable to escape. The masters were
all drinking within, so without more ado I cut off the ropes which served as traces for the
oxen, and have them wound round my body under my mantle. There must be twenty yards at least,
and as each rope is strong enough to hold double our weight there will be no difficulty in
lowering ourselves from the walls."

"You have done well indeed, Ralph," Walter said. "Let us make our way thither at once. Everyone
is so excited in the city, that, as yet, there will be but few guards upon the wall. The sooner,
therefore, that we attempt to make our escape the better."

CHAPTER XIII: THE WHITE FORD

They made their way without interruption to the wall. This they found, as they expected, entirely
deserted, although, no doubt, guards had been posted at the gates. The Flemings, however, could
have felt no fear of an attack by so small a force as the five hundred English whom they knew
to be in the neighbourhood.

Walter and his companion soon knotted the ropes together and lowered themselves into the moat.
A few strokes took them to the other side, and scrambling out, they made their way across the
country to the spot where the English had been posted. They found the Earl of Salisbury, who
commanded, in a great state of uneasiness. No message had reached him during the day. He had
heard the alarm-bells of the city ring, and a scout who had gone forward returned with the
news that the gates were closed and the drawbridges raised, and that a strong body of men manned
the walls.

"Your news is indeed bad," he said, when Walter related to him the events which had taken place
in the town. "This will altogether derange the king's plans. Now that his ally is killed I
fear that his hopes of acquiring Flanders for England will fall to the ground. It is a thousand
pities that he listened to Van Artevelde and allowed him to enter Ghent alone. Had his majesty
landed, as he wished, and made a progress through the country, the prince receiving the homage
of all the large towns, we could then very well have summoned Ghent as standing alone against
all Flanders. The citizens then would, no doubt, have gladly opened their gates and received
the prince, and if they had refused we would have made short work of them. However, as it has
turned out, it is as well that we did not enter the town with the Fleming, for against so large
and turbulent a population we should have had but little chance. And now, Master Somers, we
will march at once for Sluys and bear the news to the king, and you shall tell me as we ride
thither how you and your man-at-arms managed to escape with whole skins from such a tumult."

The king was much grieved when he heard of the death of Artevelde, and held a council with
his chief leaders. At first, in his indignation and grief, he was disposed to march upon Ghent
and to take vengeance for the murder of his ally, but after a time calmer counsels prevailed.

The Flemings were still in rebellion against their count, who was the friend of France. Were
the English to attack Ghent they would lose the general goodwill of the Flemings, and would
drive them into the arms of France, while, if matters were left alone, the effect of the popular
outburst which had caused the death of Artevelde would die away, and motives of interest and
the fear of France would again drive them into the arms of England. The expedition therefore
returned to England, and there the king, in a proclamation to his people, avoided all allusion
to the death of his ally, but simply stated that he had been waited upon by the councils of
all the Flemish towns, and that their faithful obedience to himself as legitimate King of France,
was established upon a firmer basis than ever.

This course had the effect which he had anticipated from it. The people of Flanders perceived
the danger and disadvantage which must accrue to their trade from any permanent disagreement
with England. They were convinced by the events which soon afterwards happened in France that
the King of England had more power than Phillip of Valois, and could, if he chose, punish severely
any breach of faith towards him. They therefore sent over commissioners to express their grief
and submission. The death of Artevelde was represented as the act of a frantic mob, and severe
fines were imposed upon the leaders of the party who slew him, and although the principal towns
expressed their desire still to remain under the rule of the Count of Flanders, they suggested
that the ties which bound them to England should be strengthened by the marriage of Louis,
eldest son of the count, to one of Edward's daughters. More than this, they offered to create
a diversion for the English forces acting in Guienne and Gascony by raising a strong force
and expelling the French garrisons still remaining in some parts of the country. This was done.
Hugo of Hastings was appointed by the king captain-general in Flanders, and with a force of
English and Flemings did good service by expelling the French from Termond and several other towns.

The character of Jacob van Artevelde has had but scant justice done to it by most of the historians
of the time. These, living in an age of chivalry, when noble blood and lofty deeds were held
in extraordinary respect, had little sympathy with the brewer of Ghent, and deemed it contrary
to the fitness of things that the chivalry of France should have been defied and worsted by
mere mechanics and artisans. But there can be no doubt that Artevelde was a very great man.
He may have been personally ambitious, but he was a true patriot. He had great military talents.
He completely remodelled and wonderfully improved the internal administration of the country,
and raised its commerce, manufactures, and agriculture to a pitch which they had never before
reached. After his death his memory was esteemed and revered by the Flemings, who long submitted
to the laws he had made, and preserved his regulations with scrupulous exactitude.

Edward now hastened to get together a great army. Every means were adopted to raise money and
to gather stores, and every man between sixteen and sixty south of the Trent was called upon
to take up arms and commanded to assemble at Portsmouth in the middle of Lent. A tremendous
tempest, however, scattered the fleet collected to carry the expedition, a great many of the
ships were lost, and it was not until the middle of July, 1346, that it sailed from England.

It consisted of about 500 ships and 10,000 sailors, and carried 4000 men-at-arms, 10,000 archers,
12,000 Welsh, and 6000 Irish.

This seems but a small army considering the efforts which had been made; but it was necessary
to leave a considerable force behind for the defence of the Scottish frontier, and England
had already armies in Guienne and Brittany. Lionel, Edward's second son, was appointed regent
during his father's absence. On board Edward's own ship were Godfrey of Harcourt and the Prince
of Wales. Walter, as one of the personal squires of the prince, was also on board.

The prince had been greatly interested in the details of Walter's escape from Van Artevelde's
house, the king himself expressed his approval of his conduct, and Walter was generally regarded
as one of the most promising young aspirants to the court. His modesty and good temper rendered
him a general favourite, and many even of the higher nobles noticed him by their friendly attentions,
for it was felt that he stood so high in the goodwill of the prince that he might some day
become a person of great influence with him, and one whose goodwill would be valuable.

It was generally supposed, when the fleet started, that Guienne was their destination, but
they had not gone far when a signal was made to change the direction in which they were sailing
and to make for La Hogue in Normandy. Godfrey of Harcourt had great influence in that province,
and his persuasions had much effect in determining the king to direct his course thither. There
was the further advantage that the King of France, who was well aware of the coming invasion,
would have made his preparations to receive him in Guienne. Furthermore, Normandy was the richest
and most prosperous province in France. It had for a long time been untouched by war, and offered
great abundance of spoil. It had made itself particularly obnoxious to the English by having
recently made an offer to the King of France to fit out an expedition and conquer England with
its own resources.

The voyage was short and favourable, and the expedition landed at La Hogue, on the small peninsula
of Cotentin, without opposition. Six days were spent at La Hogue disembarking the men, horses,
and stores, and baking bread for the use of the army on the march. A detachment advanced and
pillaged and burnt Barileur and Cherbourg and a number of small towns and castles.

In accordance with custom, at the commencement of the campaign a court was held, at which the
Prince of Wales was dubbed a knight by his father. A similar honour was bestowed upon a number
of other young aspirants, among whom was Walter Somers, who had been highly recommended for
that honour to the king by Sir Walter Manny.

The force was now formed into three divisions--the one commanded by the king himself, the second
by the Earl of Warwick, and the third by Godfrey of Harcourt. The Earl of Arundel acted as
Lord High Constable, and the Earl of Huntingdon, who was in command of the fleet, followed
the army along the sea-coast. Valognes, Carentan, and St. Lo were captured without difficulty,
and the English army advanced by rapid marches upon Caen, plundering the country for six or
seven leagues on each side of the line of march. An immense quantity of booty was obtained.
As soon as the news of Edward's landing in Normandy reached Paris, Phillip despatched the Count
d'Eu, Constable of France, with the Count of Tankerville and 600 men-at-arms, to oppose Edward
at Caen. The Bishop of Bayeux had thrown himself into that city, which was already garrisoned
by 300 Genoese. The town was not defensible, and the only chance of resistance was by opposing
the passage of the river Horn, which flowed between the suburbs and the city. You specify-- you have

From King Edward's position on the rising ground he could see the confusion which prevailed
in the French ranks, and small as were his forces he would probably have obtained an easy victory
by ordering a sudden charge upon them. The English, however, being dismounted, but small results
would have followed the scattering of the great host of the French. The English army therefore
remained immovable, except that the soldiers rose from the ground, and taking their places
in the ranks, awaited the onslaught of the enemy.

King Phillip himself now arrived on the field and his hatred for the English led him at once
to disregard the advice which had been given him and to order the battle to commence as soon
as possible.

The army was divided into four bodies, of which Phillip commanded one, the Count D'Alencon
the second, the King of Bohemia the third, and the Count of Savoy the fourth. Besides these
were a band of 15,000 mercenaries, Genoese crossbow-men, who were now ordered to pass between
the ranks of cavalry and to clear the ground of the English archers, who were drawn up in the
usual form in which they fought--namely, in very open order, line behind line, the men standing
alternately, so that each had ample room to use his bow and to fire over the heads of those
in front. The formation was something like that of a harrow, and, indeed, exactly resembled
that in which the Roman archers fought, and was called by them a quincunx.

The Genoese had marched four leagues beneath a hot sun loaded with their armour and heavy cross-bows,
and they remonstrated against the order, urging that they were in no condition to do good service
without some repose. The Count D'Alencon, furious at their hesitation, ordered them up, but
as they advanced a terrible thunderstorm, with torrents of rain, broke over the armies, and
wetting the cords of the crossbows rendered many of them unserviceable. At length the crossbow-men
were arranged in front, while behind them were the vast body of French cavalry, and the order
was given for the battle to begin.

The Genoese advanced with loud shouts but the English archers paid no attention to the noise,
but waited calmly for the attack. At this moment the sun, now approaching the west, shone out
brightly between the clouds behind the English, its rays streaming full in the faces of the
French. The Genoese were now within distance, and began to discharge their quarrels at their
impassive enemies, but as they opened fire the English archers drew their bows from the cases
which had protected them from the rain, and stepping forward poured their arrows among the
Genoese. The crossbow-men were smitten as with a storm, numbers were struck in the face and
other unprotected parts, and they were instantly thrown into confusion, and casting away their
cross-bows they recoiled in disorder among the horsemen behind them.

Phillip, passionate and cruel as ever, instead of trying to rally the Genoese, ordered the
cavalry behind them to fall upon them, and the men-at-arms at once plunged in among the disordered
mass of the crossbow-men, and a wild scene of carnage and confusion ensued, the English archers
continuing to pour their unerring arrows into the midst.

The Count D'Alencon, who was behind, separated his division into two bodies, and swept round
on one side himself, while the Count of Flanders did the same on the other to attack the Prince
of Wales in more regular array. Taking a circuitous route, D'Alencon appeared upon a rising
ground on the flank of the archers of the Black Prince, and thus, avoiding their arrows, charged
down with his cavalry upon the 800 men-at-arms gathered round the Black Prince, while the Count
of Flanders attacked on the other flank. Nobly did the flower of English chivalry withstand
the shock of the French, and the prince himself and the highest nobles and simple men-at-arms
fought side by side. None gave away a foot.

In vain the French, with impetuous charges, strove to break through the mass of steel. The
spear-heads were cleft off with sword and battle-axe, and again and again men and horses recoiled
from the unbroken line. Each time the French retired the English ranks were formed anew, and
as attack followed attack a pile of dead rose around them. The Count D'Alencon and the Duke
of Lorraine were among the first who fell. The young Count of Blois, finding that he could
not ride through the wall of steel, dismounted with his knights and fought his way on foot
towards the banner of the Prince of Wales. For a time the struggle was desperate, and the young
prince, with his household knights, was for a time well-nigh beaten back.

Walter, fighting close beside the prince, parried more than one blow intended for him, and
the prince himself slew the Count of Blois, whose followers all fell around him. The Count
of Flanders was also slain, and confusion began to reign among the assailants, whose leaders
had now all fallen. Phillip himself strove to advance with his division into the fight, but
the struggle between the Genoese and the men-at-arms was still continuing, and the very multitude
of his troops in the narrow and difficult field which the English had chosen for the battle
embarrassed his movements.

Charles of Luxembourg, King of the Romans, and afterwards Emperor of Germany, son of the old
King of Bohemia, with a large body of German and French cavalry, now assailed the English archers,
and in spite of their flights of arrows came to close quarters, and cutting their way through
them joined in the assault upon the men-at-arms of the Black Prince. Nearly 40,000 men were
now pressing round the little body, and the Earls of Northampton and Arundel moved forward
with their divisions to his support, while the Earl of Warwick, who was with the prince, despatched
Sir Thomas of Norwich to the king, who still remained with his powerful reserve, to ask for aid.

"Sir Thomas," demanded the king, "is my son killed, overthrown, or wounded beyond help?"

"Not so, sire," replied the knight, "but he is in a rude fight, and much needs your aid."

"Go back, Sir Thomas, to those who sent you and tell them from me that whatsoever happens they
require no aid from me so long as my son is in life. Tell them also that I command them to
let the boy win his spurs, for, God willing, the day shall be his, and the honour shall rest
with him and those into whose charge I have given him."

The prince and those around him were filled with fresh ardour when they received this message.
Each man redoubled his efforts to repel the forces that were incessantly poured down upon them
by the French. On all sides these pressed around them, striving desperately, but ever in vain,
to break through the solid ranks of the English. The French men-at-arms suffered, moreover,
terribly from the attacks of the Welsh infantry. These men, clad in thick leather jerkins,
nimble of foot, accustomed to a life of activity, were armed with shortened lances and knives,
mingled fearlessly among the confused mass of French cavalry, creeping beneath the horses'
bellies, standing up when they got a chance, and stabbing horses and men with their knives
and pikes. Many were trampled upon or struck down, but numbering, as they did, 6000, they pervaded
the whole mass of the enemy, and did terrible execution, adding in no small degree to the confusion
caused by the shower of arrows from the archers within the circle of the men-at-arms. The instant
a French knight fell, struck from his horse with a battle-axe or arrow, or by the fall of a
wounded steed, the half-wild Welsh were upon him, and slew him before he could regain his feet.

The slaughter was immense. The Count of Harcourt, with his nephew the Count D'Aumale and his
two gallant sons, fell together, and at last Charles of Luxembourg, seeing his banner down,
his troops routed, his friends slain, and the day irreparably lost, and being himself severely
wounded in three places, turned his horse and fled, casting off his rich emblazoned surcoat
to avoid recognition. In the meantime Prince Charles's father, the veteran King of Bohemia,
once one of the most famous warriors of Europe, but now old and blind, sat on horseback at
a little distance from the fight; the knights around him told him the events as they happened,
and the old monarch soon saw that the day was lost. He asked them for tidings of his son Charles
of Luxembourg, but they were forced to reply that the banner of the King of the Romans was
no longer in sight, but that, doubtless, he was somewhere engaged in the melee.

"Lords," said the old man, "you are my vassals, my friends, and my companions, and on this
day I command and beseech you to lead me forward so far that I may deal one blow of my sword
in the battle."

His faithful friends obeyed him, a number of knights arranged themselves around him, and lest
they should lose him in the fight they tied their horses together by the bridles and charged
down into the fray. Advancing directly against the banner of the Prince of Wales, the blind
monarch was carried into the midst of the thickest strife.

There the little group of knights fought gallantly, and after the battle was over, the bodies
of the king and his friends were found lying together, their dead horses still linked by the
bridles.

During this terrible battle, which had been raging since three o'clock, Phillip had made strenuous
efforts to aid his troops engaged in the front by continually sending fresh bodies to the assault.
It was now growing dark, terror and confusion had already spread among the French, and many
were flying in all directions, and the unremitting showers of English arrows still flew like
hail among their ranks. As the king made his way forward, surrounded by his personal attendants
to take part himself in the fight, his followers fell thick around him, and his horse was slain
by an arrow. John of Hainault, who had remained by his side during the whole day, mounted upon
a fresh horse and urged him to fly, as the day was lost. Phillip, however, persisted, and made
his way into the melee, where he fought for some time with extreme courage, until almost all
around him were slain, the royal standard bearer killed, and himself wounded in two places.
John of Hainault then seized his bridle exclaiming "Come away, sire, it is full time; do not
throw your life away foolishly; if you have lost this day you will win another," and so almost
forced the unwilling king from the field. Phillip, accompanied by the lords of Montmorency,
Beaujeu, Aubigny, and Mansault, with John of Hainault, and sixty men-at-arms, rode to the Castle
of Broye, and there halted for a few hours. At midnight he again set out, and in the morning
arrived safely at Amiens.

The Black Prince held his station until night without yielding a single step to all the efforts
of the French. Gradually, however, the assailants became less and less numerous, the banners
disappeared, and the shouts of the leaders and the clang of arms died away, and the silence
which prevailed over the field at once announced that the victory was complete and the enemy
in full flight. An immense number of torches were now lighted through the English lines, and
the king, quitting for the first time his station on the hill, came down to embrace his gallant
son. Edward and his host rejoiced in a spirit of humility over the victory. No songs of triumph,
no feastings or merriment were permitted, but a solemn service of the church was held, and
the king and his soldiers offered their thanks to God for the victory He had given them. The
English army lay all night under arms, and a number of scattered parties of the French, wandering
about in the darkness, entered the lines and were slain or taken prisoners.

The dawn of the next morning was thick and foggy, and intelligence coming in that a large body
of the enemy were advancing upon them, the Earls of Northampton, Warwick, and Norfolk, with
500 men-at-arms and 2000 archers, went out to reconnoitre, and came in the misty twilight upon
an immense force composed of the citizens of Beauvais, Rouen, and some other towns, led by
the Grand Prior of France and the Archbishop of Rouen, who were approaching the field.

By some extraordinary accident they had not met any of the fugitives flying from Cressy, and
were ignorant that a battle had been fought. The English charged them at once. Their advance-guard,
consisting of burghers, was easily overthrown. The second division, which was composed of men-at-arms,
fought bravely, but was unable to withstand the charge of the triumphant English, and was completely
broken and defeated. The Grand Prior was killed and a vast number of his followers slain or
captured. During the whole of the morning detached parties from Edward's army scoured the country,
dispersing and slaughtering bands of French who still remained together, and towards night
the Earl of Northampton returned to the camp with the news that no enemy remained in the vicinity
that could offer a show of resistance to the English force.

It is said that a far greater number of French were killed upon the second day than upon the
first. This can be accounted for by the fact that on the first day but a small portion of the
English army were engaged, and that upon the second the English were fresh and vigorous, and
their enemy exhausted and dispirited.

The greater number of the French nobles and knights who fell, died in their attempts to break
through the Black Prince's array. Besides the King of Bohemia, nine sovereign princes and eighty
great nobles were killed, with 1200 knights, 1500 men-at-arms, and 30,000 foot; while on the
English side only three knights and a small number of men-at-arms and infantry were killed.

The body of the King of Bohemia and those of the other great leaders were carried in solemn
pomp to the Abbey of Maintenay. Edward himself and his son accompanied them as mourners. On
the Monday following Edward marched with his army against Calais, and summoned the town to
surrender. John of Vienne, who commanded the garrison, refused to comply with the demand. The
fortifications of the town were extremely strong and the garrison numerous, and Edward perceived
that an assault would be very unlikely to succeed, and would entail great loss, while a repulse
would have dimmed the lustre of the success which he had gained. He therefore determined to
reduce it by famine, and the troops were set to work to build huts. So permanently and strongly
were these constructed that it seemed to the enemy that King Edward was determined to remain
before Calais even should he have to stay there for ten years.

Proclamations were issued in England and Flanders inviting traders to establish stores and
to bring articles of trade of all kinds, and in a short time a complete town sprang up which
was named by Edward "New-Town the Bold". The English fleet held complete possession of the
sea, cutting off the besieged from all succour by ship, and enabling abundant supplies for
the army to be brought from England and Flanders. Strong parties were sent out in all directions.
The northern provinces of France were scoured, and the army was amply provided with necessaries
and even luxuries.

After the first terrible shock caused by the crushing defeat of Cressy, King Phillip began
at once to take measures for the relief of Calais, and made immense efforts again to put a
great army in the field. He endeavoured by all means in his power to gain fresh allies. The
young Count of Flanders, who, at the death of his father at Cressy, was sixteen years of age,
was naturally even more hostile to the English than the late prince had been, and he strove
to win over his subjects to the French alliance, while Phillip made them magnificent offers
if they would join him. The Flemings, however, remained stanch to the English alliance, and
held their prince in duresse until he at last consented to marry the daughter of Edward. A
week before the date fixed for the nuptials, however, he managed to escape from the vigilance
of his guards when out hawking, and fled to the court of France.

In Scotland Phillip was more successful, and David Bruce, instead of employing the time given
him by the absence of Edward with his armies in driving out the English garrisons from the
strong places they still held in Scotland, raised an army of 50,000 men and marched across
the border into England plundering and ravaging. Queen Philippa, however, raising an army,
marched against him, and the Scotch were completely defeated at Neville's Cross, 15,000 being
killed and their king himself taken prisoner.

Walter's conduct at the battle of Cressy gained him still further the favour of the Black Prince.
The valour with which he had fought was conspicuous even on a field where all fought gallantly,
and the prince felt that more than once he would have been smitten down had not Walter's sword
interposed. Ralph too had fought with reckless bravery, and many French knights and gentlemen
had gone down before the tremendous blows of his heavy mace, against which the stoutest armour
availed nothing. After the battle the prince offered to make him an esquire in spite of the
absence of gentle blood in his veins, but Ralph declined the honour.

"An it please you, Sir Prince," he said, "but I should feel more comfortable among the men-at-arms,
my fellows. In the day of battle I trust that I should do no discredit to my squirehood, but
at other times I should feel woefully out of my element, and should find nought for my hands
to do, therefore if it so pleases your Royal Highness, I would far rather remain a simple man-at-arms."

Ralph did not, however, refuse the heavy purse which the prince gave him, although indeed he,
as well as all the soldiers, was well supplied with money, so great were the spoils which the
army had gathered in its march before Cressy, and which they now swept off in their raids among
the northern provinces of France.

One evening Walter was returning from a banquet at the pavilion of the Prince of Wales, with
Ralph as usual following at a little distance, when from a corner of the street a man darted
suddenly out and struck a dagger with all his force between his shoulders. Well was it for
Walter that he had taken Geoffrey's advice, and had never laid aside the shirt of mail, night
or day. Fine as was its temper, two or three links of the outer fold were broken, but the point
did not penetrate the second fold, and the dagger snapped in the hand of the striker. The force
of the sudden blow, however, hurled Walter to the ground. With a loud cry Ralph rushed forward.
The man instantly fled. Ralph pursued him but a short distance and then hastened back to Walter.

"Are you hurt, Sir Walter?" he exclaimed.

"In no way, Ralph, thanks to my shirt of mail. Well, indeed, was it for me that I was wearing
it, or I should assuredly have been a dead man. I had almost begun to forget that I was a threatened
man; but I shall be on guard for the future."

"I wish I had followed the fellow," Ralph said. "I would not have slain him could I have helped
it, but would have left it for the hangman to extort from him the name of his employer; but,
in truth, he struck so hard, and you fell so straight before the blow, that I feared the mail
had given way, and that you were sorely wounded if not killed. You have oft told me that I
was over-careful of you, but you see that I was not careful enough, however, you may be assured
that if another attempt be made those who attempt it shall not get off scot free. Do you think
of laying a complaint before the provost against him you suspect?"

"It would be useless, Ralph. We may have suspicion of the man from whom the blow came, but
have no manner of proof. It might have been done by any ruffian camp-follower who struck the
blow only with the hope of carrying off my chain and purse. The camp swarms with such fellows,
and we have no clue which could lead to his detection, unless," he added, stooping and picking
a piece of steel which lay at his feet, "this broken dagger may some day furnish us with one.
No; we will say nought about it. Sir James Carnegie is not now in camp, having left a week
since on business in England. We exchange no words when we meet, but I heard that he had been
called away. Fortunately the young prince likes him not, and I therefore have seldom occasion
to meet him. I have no doubt that he credits me with the disfavour in which he is held by the
prince; but I have never even mentioned his name before him, and the prince's misliking is
but the feeling which a noble and generous heart has, as though by instinct, against one who
is false and treacherous. At the same time we must grant that this traitor knight is a bold
and fearless man-at-arms; he fought well at La Blanche Tache and Cressy, and he is much liked
and trusted by my lord of Northampton, in whose following he mostly rides; 'tis a pity that
one so brave should have so foul and treacherous a heart. Here we are at my hut, and you can
sleep soundly tonight, Ralph, for there is little fear that the fellow, who has failed tonight,
will repeat his attempt for some time. He thinks, no doubt, that he has killed me, for with
a blow so strongly struck he would scarcely have felt the snapping of the weapon, and is likely
enough already on board one of the ships which ply to and fro from England on his way to acquaint
his employer that I am removed from his path."

The next morning Walter mentioned to the Black Prince the venture which had befallen him, and
the narrow escape he had had of his life. The prince was extremely exasperated, and gave orders
that an inquisition should be made through the camp, and that all men found there not being
able to give a good account of themselves as having reasonable and lawful calling there should
be forthwith put on board ship and sent to England. He questioned Walter closely whether he
deemed that the attack was for the purpose of plunder only, or whether he had any reason to
believe that he had private enemies.

"There is a knight who is evilly disposed toward me, your highness," Walter said; "but seeing
that I have no proof whatever that he had a hand in this affair, however strongly I may suspect
it, I would fain, with your leave, avoid mentioning his name."

"But think you that there is any knight in this camp capable of so foul an action?"

"I have had proofs, your highness, that he is capable of such an act; but in this matter my
tongue is tied, as the wrong he attempted was not against myself, but against others who have
so far forgiven him that they would fain the matter should drop. He owes me ill-will, seeing
that I am aware of his conduct, and that it was my intervention which caused his schemes to
fail. Should this attempt against me be repeated it can scarce be the effect of chance, but
would show premeditated design, and I would then, both in defence of my own life, and because
I think that such deeds should not go unpunished, not hesitate to name him to you, and if proof
be wanting to defy him to open combat."

"I regret, Sir Walter, that your scruples should hinder you from at once denouncing him; but
seeing how grave a matter it is to charge a knight with so foul a crime, I will not lay stress
upon you; but be assured that should any repetition of the attempt be made I shall take the
matter in hand, and will see that this caitiff knight receives his desserts."

A short time afterwards Walter accompanied the prince in an excursion which he made with a
portion of the army, sweeping the French provinces as far as the river Somme. Upon their way
back they passed through the village of Pres, hard by which stood a small castle. It was situated
some forty miles from Calais, and standing upon rising ground, it commanded a very extensive
view over the country.

"What say you, Sir Walter?" the prince said to the young knight who was riding near him. "That
castle would make a good advanced post, and a messenger riding in could bring news of any large
movements of the enemy." Walter assented. "Then, Sir Walter, I name you chatelain. I shall
be sorry to lose your good company; but the post is one of peril, and I know that you are ever
longing to distinguish yourself. Take forty men-at-arms and sixty archers. With that force
you may make shift to resist any attack until help reaches you from camp. You may be sure that
I shall not be slack in spurring to your rescue should you be assailed."

Walter received the proposal with delight. He was weary of the monotony of life in New Town,
and this post in which vigilance and activity would be required was just to his taste; so,
taking the force named by the prince, with a store of provision, he drew off from the column
and entered the castle.

CHAPTER XV: THE SIEGE OF A FORTALICE

Walter's first step on assuming the command was to examine thoroughly into the capabilities
of defence of the place, to see that the well was in good order, and the supply of water ample,
and to send out a foraging party, which, driving in a number of beasts and some cart-loads
of forage, would supply his garrison for some time. The castle he found was less strong than
it looked. The walls were lightly built, and were incapable of withstanding any heavy battering.
The moat was dry, and the flanking towers badly placed, and affording little protection to
the faces of the walls; however, the extent of the defences was small, and Walter felt confident
that with the force at his command he could resist any sudden attack, unless made in overwhelming
force, so that all the faces of the wall could be assaulted at the same time. He had a large
number of great stones brought in to pile against the gate, while others were brought into
the central keep, similarly to defend the door should the outer wall be carried. He appointed
Ralph as his lieutenant, and every day, leaving him in charge of the castle, rode through the
country for many miles round, with twenty men-at-arms, to convince himself that no considerable
force of the enemy were approaching. These reconnaissances were not without some danger and
excitement, for several times bodies of the country people, armed with scythes, axes, and staves,
tried to intercept them on their return to the castle, and once or twice Walter and his men
had to fight their way through their opponents. Contrary to the custom of the times, Walter
gave orders to his men not to slay any when resistance had ceased.

"They are but doing what we ourselves should do did French garrisons hold our castles at home,
and I deem them in no way to be blamed for the efforts which they make to slay us. In self-defence,
of course, we must do our best, and must kill in order that we may not ourselves be slain;
but when they are once routed, let them go to their homes. Poor people, the miseries which
this war has brought upon them are great, and there is no wonder that they hate us."

This leniency on Walter's part was not without good effect. When the country people found that
the garrison of the castle of Pres did not carry fire and sword through the villages around,
that they took only sufficient for their needs, and behaved with courtesy to all, their animosity
to a great extent subsided. No longer did the women and children of the little villages fly
to the woods when they saw the gleam of Walter's approaching spears, but remained at their
avocations, and answered willingly enough the questions which he asked them as to whether they
had heard aught of the movements of French troops. So far as possible, Walter refrained from
seizing the cattle or stores of grain of the poorer classes, taking such as he needed from
the lands of the wealthy proprietors, all of whom had left the country, and were either with
the French army or sheltering in Paris. Five of his best mounted men Walter chose as messengers,
and one rode each day to New Town with the news which had been gathered, returning on the following
day, and then resting his horse for three days before again setting out.

Night and day sentries were placed on the walls, for although Walter heard nothing of any body
gathering in his immediate vicinity, a force might at any moment issue from Amiens and appear
suddenly before the place. Such was indeed what really took place, and at daybreak one morning
Walter was aroused by the news that the sentinels saw a large body of men rapidly approaching.
The horse of the messenger next on duty stood, as usual, saddled and bridled in readiness,
and without a moment's delay Walter ordered the man to mount and ride to the prince, and to
give news that the castle was assailed, but by how large a force he could not as yet say.

The instant the messenger had started through the gates Walter ascended to the walls; he saw
at once that the party was a strong one; for although still at some distance, and but dimly
seen in the gray morning light, he judged that it must contain at least a thousand men-at-arms.
At this moment a call from the sentry on the other side of the castle was heard, and hastening
thither, Walter saw that another body nearly as numerous as the first were approaching from
the side of Calais, having made a detour so as to place themselves between the castle and the
army, to which news would naturally be sent of their coming. Walter watched his messenger,
who had now ridden half a mile towards the approaching body. Suddenly he saw him turn his horse
and ride off at right angles to the road.

"He sees them," he said, "and is going to try to ride round them. I fear that there is but
little hope of his escaping, seeing that they are between him and Calais, and that assuredly
some among them must be as well or better mounted than himself." As he spoke a party of horsemen
were seen to detach themselves from the flank of the French column and to gallop off at full
speed to intercept the messenger; the latter diverged more and more from his course, but he
was constantly headed off by his pursuers, and at last, seeing the impossibility of getting
through them, he again turned his horse's head and galloped off towards the castle, which he
reached a few hundred yards only in advance of his foes.

"I could not help it, Sir Walter," he said, as he galloped in at the gate. "I found that although
Robin is fast, some of those horsemen had the turn of speed of me, and that it was impossible
that I could get through; so deeming that I should do more service by coming to strike a blow
here than by having my throat cut out in the fields, I made the best of my way back."

"Quite right, Martin!" Walter said. "I should have been grieved had you thrown your life away
needlessly. I saw from the first that your escape was cut off. And now, men, each to his place;
but first pile up the stones against the gate, and then let each man take a good meal, for
it is like enough to be long before we get a chance of doing so again."

Again ascending to the walls Walter saw that the first body of men-at-arms he had perceived
was followed at a distance by a strong force of footmen having with them some large wagons.

"I fear," he said to Ralph, "that they have brought machines with them from Amiens, and in
that case they will not be long in effecting a breach, for doubtless they know that the walls
are but weak. We shall have to fight stoutly, for it may be days before the news of our leaguer
reaches the camp. However, I trust that the prince will, by tomorrow night, when he finds that
two days have elapsed without the coming of my usual messenger, suspect that we are besieged
and will sally forth to our assistance. And now let us to breakfast, for we shall need all
our strength today, and you may be sure that French will lose no time in attacking, seeing
that assistance may shortly arrive from Calais."

There were but few preparations to be made. Each man had had his post assigned to him on the
walls in case of an attack, and piles of stones had been collected in readiness to cast down
upon the heads of those attempting an assault. Cauldrons were carried up to the walls and filled
with water, and great fires were lighted under them. In half an hour the French infantry had
reached the spot, but another two hours elapsed before any hostile movement was made, the leaders
of the assailants giving their men that time to rest after their long march. Then a stir was
visible among them, and they were seen to form in four columns, each about a thousand strong,
which advanced simultaneously against opposite sides of the castle. As soon as their intentions
were manifest Walter divided his little force, and these, gathering in four groups upon the
walls, prepared to resist the assault. To four of his most trusty men-at-arms he assigned the
command of these parties, he himself and Ralph being thus left free to give their aid where
it was most needed.

The assailants were well provided with scaling-ladders, and advanced with a number of crossbow-men
in front, who speedily opened a hot fire on the walls. Walter ordered his archers to bide their
time, and not to fire a shot till certain that every shaft would tell. They accordingly waited
until the French arrived within fifty yards of the wall, when the arrows began to rain among
them with deadly effect, scarce one but struck its mark--the face of an enemy. Even the closed
vizors of the knights and chief men-at-arms did not avail to protect their wearers; the shafts
pierced between the bars or penetrated the slits left open for sight, and many fell slain by
the first volley. But their numbers were far too great to allow the columns being checked by
the fire of so small a number of archers; the front ranks, indeed, pressed forward more eagerly
than before, being anxious to reach the foot of the wall, where they would be in comparative
shelter from the arrows.

The archers disturbed themselves in no way at the reaching of the wall by the heads of the
columns; but continued to shoot fast and true into the mass behind them, and as these were,
for the most part, less completely armed than their leaders, numbers fell under the fire of
the sixty English bowmen. It was the turn of the men-at-arms now. Immediately the assailants
poured into the dry moat and sought to raise their ladders the men-at-arms hurled down the
masses of stones piled in readiness, while some poured buckets of boiling water over them.
In spite of the loss they were suffering the French raised their ladders, and, covering their
heads with their shields, the leaders strove to gain the walls. As they did so, some of the
archers took post in the flanking towers, and as with uplifted arms the assailants climbed
the ladders, the archers smote them above the joints of their armour beneath the arm-pits,
while the men-at-arms with pike and battle-axe hewed down those who reached the top of the
ladders. Walter and Ralph hastened from point to point encouraging the men and joining in the
defence where the pressure was hottest; and at last, after two hours of vain effort and suffering
great loss, the assailants drew off and the garrison had breathing time.

"Well done, my men!" Walter said, cheeringly; "they have had a lesson which they will remember,
and if so be that they have brought with them no machines we may hold out against them for
any time."

It was soon manifest, however, that along with the scaling-ladders the enemy had brought one
of their war-machines. Men were seen dragging massive beams of timber towards the walls, and
one of the wagons was drawn forward and upset on its side at a distance of sixty yards from
the wall, not, however, without those who drew it suffering much from the arrows of the bowmen.
Behind the shelter thus formed the French began to put together the machine, whose beams soon
raised themselves high above the wagon.

In the meantime groups of men dragged great stones laid upon a sort of hand sledge to the machine,
and late in the afternoon it began to cast its missiles against the wall. Against these Walter
could do little. He had no sacks, which, filled with earth, he might have lowered to cover
the part of the walls assailed, and beyond annoying those working the machines by flights of
arrows shot high in the air, so as to descend point downwards among them, he could do nothing.

The wall crumbled rapidly beneath the blows of the great stones, and Walter saw that by the
following morning a breach would be effected. When night fell he called his men together and
asked if any would volunteer to carry news through the enemy to the prince. The enterprise
seemed well-nigh hopeless, for the French, as if foreseeing that such an attempt might be made,
had encamped in a complete circle round the castle, as was manifest by the position of their
fires. Several men stepped forward, and Walter chose three light and active men--archers--to
attempt the enterprise. These stripped off their steel caps and breastpieces, so that they
might move more quickly, and when the French fires burned low and all was quiet save the creak
of the machine and the dull heavy blows of the stones against the wall, the three men were
lowered by ropes at different points, and started on their enterprise. A quarter of an hour
later the garrison heard shouts and cries, and knew that a vigilant watch had been set by the
French, and that one, if not all, of their friends had fallen into their hands. All night long
the machine continued to play.

An hour before daylight, when he deemed that the enemy's vigilance would be relaxed, Walter
caused himself with Ralph and twelve of his men-at-arms to be lowered by ropes from the wall.
Each rope had a loop at the bottom in which one foot was placed, and knots were tied in order
to give a better grasp for the hands. They were lowered at a short distance from the spot at
which the machine was at work; all were armed with axes, and they made their way unperceived
until within a few yards of the wagon. Then there was a cry of alarm, and in a moment they
rushed forward among the enemy. The men working the machine were instantly cut down, and Walter
and his party fell upon the machine, cutting the ropes and smashing the wheels and pulleys
and hewing away at the timber itself. In a minute or two, however, they were attacked by the
enemy, the officer in command having bade a hundred men lie down to sleep close behind the
machine in case the garrison should attempt a sortie. Walter called upon Ralph and four of
the men-at-arms to stand beside him while the others continued their work of destruction. The
French came up in a tumultuous body, but, standing so far apart that they could wield their
axes, the English dealt such destruction among their first assailants that these for a time
recoiled. As fresh numbers came up, encouraged by their leader they renewed the attack, and
in spite of the most tremendous efforts Walter and his party were driven back. By this time,
however, so much damage had been done to the machine that it would be some hours before it
could be repaired, even if spare ropes and other appliances had been brought with it from Amiens;
so that, reinforced by the working party, Walter was again able to hold his ground and after
repulsing a fresh onslaught of the enemy he gave the word for his men to retire at full speed.

The French were so surprised by the sudden disappearance of their foes that it was a moment
or two before they started in pursuit, and Walter and his men had gained some thirty yards
before the pursuit really commenced.

The night was a dark one, and they considerably increased this advantage before they reach
the foot of the wall, where the ropes were hanging.

"Has each of you found his rope?" Walter asked.

As soon as an affirmative answer was given he placed his foot in the loop and shouted to the
men above to draw up, and before the enraged enemy could reach the spot the whole party were
already some yards above their heads. The archers opened fire upon the French, doing, in spite
of the darkness, considerable execution, for the men had snatched up their arms at the sudden
alarm, and had joined the fray in such haste that many of them had not had time to put on their
steel caps. There was noise and bustle in the enemy's camp, for the whole force were now under
arms, and in their anger at the sudden blow which had been struck them some bodies of men even
moved forward towards the walls as if they intended to renew the assault of the previous day;
but the showers of arrows with which they were greeted cooled their ardour and they presently
retired out of reach of bowshot. There was a respite now for the besiegers. No longer every
few minutes did a heavy stone strike the walls.

The morning's light enabled the defenders of the castle to see the extent of the damage which
the battering machine had effected. None too soon had they put a stop to its work, for had
it continued its operations another hour or two would have effected a breach.

Already large portions of the wall facing it had fallen, and other portions were so seriously
damaged that a few more blows would have levelled them.

"At any rate," Walter said to Ralph, "we have gained a respite; but even now I fear that if
the Black Prince comes not until tomorrow he will arrive too late."

The French, apparently as well aware as the garrison of the necessity for haste, laboured at
the repair of the machine. Bodies of men started to cut down trees to supply the place of the
beams which had been rendered useless. Scarcely had the assault ceased when horsemen were despatched
in various directions to seek for fresh ropes, and by dint of the greatest exertions the machine
was placed in position to renew its attack shortly after noon.

By two o'clock several large portions of the damaged wall had fallen, and the debris formed
a slope by which an assaulting column could rush to the bridge. As soon as this was manifest
the French force formed for the assault and rushed forward in solid column.

Walter had made the best preparation possible for the defence. In the courtyard behind the
breach his men had since morning been driving a circle of piles, connected by planks fastened
to them. These were some five feet high, and along the top and in the face next to the breach
sharp-pointed spikes and nails had been driven, rendering it difficult in the extreme for anyone
to climb over. As the column of the assailants approached Walter placed his archers on the
walls on either side of the breach, while he himself, with his men-at-arms, took his station
in the gap and faced the coming host. The breach was some ten yards wide, but it was only for
about half this width that the mound of broken stones rendered it possible for their enemies
to assault, consequently there was but a space of some fifteen feet in width to be defended.
Regardless of the flights of arrows, the French, headed by their knights and squires, advanced
to the assault, and clambering up the rough stones attacked the defenders.

Walter, with Ralph and three of his best men-at-arms, stood in the front line and received
the first shock of the assault. The roughness and steepness of the mound prevented the French
from attacking in regular order, and the very eagerness of the knights and squires who came
first in contact with their enemies was a hindrance to them. When the columns were seen gathering
for the assault Walter had scattered several barrels full of oil and tar which he found in
the cellars over the mound in front of the breach, rendering it greasy and slippery, and causing
the assailants to slip and stagger and many to fall as they pressed forward to the assault.
Before the fight commenced he had encouraged his soldiers by recalling to them how a mere handful
of men had at Cressy withstood for hours the desperate efforts of the whole of the French army
to break through their line, and all were prepared to fight to the death.

The struggle was a desperate one. Served by their higher position, and by the difficulties
which the French encountered from the slipperiness of the ground and their own fierce ardour
to attack, Walter and his little band for a long time resisted every effort. He with his sword
and Ralph with his heavy mace did great execution, and they were nobly seconded by their men-at-arms.
As fast as one fell another took his place. The breach in front of them was cumbered with dead
and red with blood. Still the French poured upwards in a wave, and the sheer weight of their
numbers and the fatigue caused by the tremendous exertions the defenders were making began
to tell. Step by step the English were driven back, and Walter saw that the defence could not
much longer be continued. He bade one of his men-at-arms at once order the archers to cease
firing, and, leaving the walls, to take refuge in the keep, and thence to open fire upon the
French as they poured through the breach.

When he found that this movement had been accomplished Walter bade the men-at-arms fall back
gradually. A gap had been left in the wooden fence sufficient for one at a time to pass, and
through this the men-at-arms retired one by one to the keep until only Walter and five others
were left. With these Walter flung himself suddenly upon the assailants and forced them a few
feet down the slope. Then he gave the word, and all sprang back, and leaping down from the
wall into the courtyard ran through the barrier, Walter and Ralph being the last to pass as
the French with exulting shouts leapt down from the breach. There was another fierce fight
at the barrier. Walter left Ralph to defend this with a few men-at-arms while he saw that all
was in readiness for closing the door rapidly in the keep. Then he ran back again. He was but
just in time. Ralph indeed could for a long time have held the narrow passage, but the barriers
themselves were yielding. The French were pouring in through the breach, and as those behind
could not see the nature of the obstacle which arrested the advance of their companions they
continued to push forward, and by their weight pressed those in front against the spikes in
the barrier. Many perished miserably on these. Others, whose armour protected them from this
fate, were crushed to death by the pressure; but this was now so great that the timbers were
yielding. Walter, seeing that in another moment they would be levelled, gave the word, sprang
back with Ralph and his party, and entered the keep just as with a crash the barrier fell and
the French poured in a crowd into the courtyard. Bolting the door the defenders of the keep
piled against it the stones which had been laid in readiness.

The door was on the first floor, and was approached by a narrow flight of stone steps, up which
but two abreast could advance. In their first fury the French poured up these steps, but from
the loopholes which commanded it the English bowmen shot so hard that their arrows pierced
the strongest armour. Smitten through vizor and armour, numbers of the bravest of the assailants
fell dead. Those who gained the top of the steps were assailed by showers of boiling oil from
an upper chamber which projected over the door, and whose floor was pierced for this purpose,
while from the top of the keep showers of stones were poured down. After losing great numbers
in this desperate effort at assault the French drew off for a while, while their leaders held
council as to the best measures to be taken for the capture of the keep.

After a time Walter from the summit saw several bodies of men detach themselves from the crowd
still without the castle and proceed into the country. Two hours later they were seen returning
laden with trunks of trees. These were dragged through the breach, and were, in spite of the
efforts of the archers and of the men-at-arms with their stones, placed so as to form a sort
of penthouse against one side of the keep. Numbers of the soldiers now poured up with sacks
and all kinds of vessels which they had gathered from the surrounding villages, filled with
earth. This was thrown over the beams until it filled all the crevices between them and formed
a covering a foot thick, so that neither boiling oil nor water poured from above could penetrate
to injure those working beneath its shelter. When all was ready a strong body armed with picks
and crowbars entered the penthouse and began to labour to cut away the wall of the keep itself.

"Their commander knows his business," Walter said, "and the device is an excellent one. We
can do nothing, and it only depends upon the strength of the wall how long we can hold out.
The masonry is by no means good, and before nightfall, unless aid comes, there will be nought
for us but death or surrender."

CHAPTER XVI: A PRISONER

As long as it was light an anxious look-out was kept from the top of the keep towards Calais.
There was nothing to be done. The besiegers who had entered the walls were ensconced in the
various buildings in the courtyard or placed behind walls so as to be out of arrow-shot from
above, and were in readiness to repel any sortie which might be made to interfere with the
work going on under the penthouse. But no sortie was possible, for to effect this it would
be necessary to remove the stones from the door, and before this could be accomplished the
besiegers would have rallied in overwhelming force, nor could a sortie have effected anything
beyond the slaying of the men actually engaged in the work. The beams of the penthouse were
too strong and too heavily weighted with earth to be removed, and the attempt would only have
entailed useless slaughter. The penthouse was about forty feet in length, and the assailants
were piercing three openings, each of some six feet in width, leaving two strong supporting
pillars between them. Anxiously the garrison within listened to the sounds of work, which became
louder and louder as the walls crumbled before the stroke of pickaxe and crowbar.

"I shall hold out until the last moment," Walter said to Ralph, "in hopes of relief, but before
they burst in I shall sound a parley. To resist further would be a vain sacrifice of life."

Presently a movement could be seen among the stones, and then almost simultaneously two apertures
appeared. The chamber into which the openings were made was a large one, being used as the
common room of the garrison. Here twenty archers, and the remaining men-at-arms--of whom nearly
one-half had fallen in the defence of the breach--were gathered, and the instant the orifices
appeared the archers began to send their arrows through them. Then Walter ascended to another
chamber, and ordered the trumpeter to sound a parley.

The sound was repeated by the assailants' trumpeter.

"Who commands the force?" Walter asked.

"I, Guy, Count of Evreux."

"I am Sir Walter Somers," the young knight continued. "I wish to ask terms for the garrison.

"You must surrender unconditionally," the count replied from the courtyard. "In ten minutes
we shall have completely pierced your walls, and you will be at our mercy."

"You may pierce our walls," Walter replied, "but it will cost you many lives before you force
your way in; we will defend the hold from floor to floor, and you know how desperate men can
fight. It will cost you scores of lives before you win your way to the summit of this keep;
but if I have your knightly word that the lives of all within these walls shall be spared,
then will I open the door and lay down our arms."

A consultation took place between the leaders below. There was truth in Walter's words that
very many lives would be sacrificed before the resistance of so gallant a garrison could be
overcome. Every minute was of importance, for it was possible that at any moment aid might
arrive from Calais, and that the table would be turned upon the besiegers.

Therefore, after a short parley among themselves, the count replied:

"You have fought as a gallant knight and gentleman, Sir Walter Somers, and have wrought grievous
harm upon my leading. I should grieve that so brave a knight should lose his life in a useless
resistance. Therefore I agree to your terms, and swear upon my knightly honour that upon your
surrendering yourselves prisoners of war, the lives of all within these walls shall be spared."

Walter at once gave the order. The stones were removed and the door thrown open, and leading
his men Walter descended the steps into the courtyard, which was now illuminated with torches,
and handed his sword to the Count of Evreux.

"You promised me, count," a tall knight standing by his side said, "that if he were taken alive,
the commander of this castle should be my prisoner."

"I did so, Sir Phillip Holbeaut. When you proposed this adventure to me, and offered to place
your following at my command, I agreed to the request you made me; but mind," he said sternly,
"my knightly word has been given for his safety. See that he receives fair and gentle treatment
at your hand. I would not that aught should befall so brave a knight."

"I seek him no harm," the knight said angrily; "but I know that he is one of the knights of
the Black Prince's own suite, and that his ransom will be freely paid, and as my coffers are
low from the expenses of the war, I would fain replenish them at the expense of the English
prince."

"I said not that I doubted you, Sir Phillip," the count said calmly; "but as the knight surrendered
on my word, it was needful that I should warn you to treat him as I myself should do did he
remain in my hands, and to give him fair treatment until duly ransomed."

"I should be glad, count," Walter said, "if you will suffer me to take with me as companion
in my captivity this man-at-arms. He is strongly attached to me, and we have gone through many
perils together; it will lighten my captivity to have him by my side."

"Surely I will do so, Sir Walter, and wish that your boon had been a larger one. The rest I
will take back with me to Amiens, there to hold until exchanged for some of those who at various
times have fallen into your king's hands. And now to work, men; lose not a moment in stripping
the castle of all that you choose to carry away, then apply fire to the storehouses, granaries,
and the hold itself. I would not that it remained standing to serve as an outpost for the English."

The horses were brought from the stables. Walter and Ralph took their horses by the bridle,
and followed Sir Phillip Holbeaut through the now open gates of the castle to the spot where
the horses of the besiegers were picketed. The knight, and his own men-at-arms, who had at
the beginning of the day numbered a hundred and fifty, but who were now scarcely two-thirds
of that strength, at once mounted with their prisoners, and rode off from the castle. A few
minutes later a glare of light burst out from behind them. The count's orders had been obeyed;
fire had been applied to the stores of forage, and soon the castle of Pres was wrapped in flames.

"I like not our captor's manner," Ralph said to Walter as they rode along side by side.

"I agree with you, Ralph. I believe that the reason which he gave the count for his request
was not a true one, though, indeed, I can see no other motive which he could have for seeking
to gain possession of me. Sir Phillip, although a valiant knight, bears but an indifferent
reputation. I have heard that he is a cruel master to his serfs, and that when away fighting
in Germany he behaved so cruelly to the peasantry that even the Germans, who are not nice in
their modes of warfare, cried out against him. It is an evil fortune that has thrown us into
his hands; still, although grasping and avaricious, he can hardly demand for a simple knight
any inordinate ransom. The French themselves would cry out did he do so, seeing that so large
a number of their own knights are in our hands, and that the king has ample powers of retaliation;
however, we need not look on the dark side. It is not likely that our captivity will be a long
one, for the prince, who is the soul of generosity, will not haggle over terms, but will pay
my ransom as soon as he hears into whose hands I have fallen, while there are scores of men-at-arms
prisoners, whom he can exchange for you. Doubtless Sir Phillip will send you over, as soon
as he arrives at his castle, with one of his own followers to treat for my ransom."

After riding for some hours the troop halted their weary horses in a wood, and lighting fires,
cooked their food, and then lay down until morning. Sir Phillip exchanged but few words with
his captive; as, having removed his helm, he sat by the fire, Walter had an opportunity of
seeing his countenance. It did not belie his reputation. His face had a heavy and brutal expression
which was not decreased by the fashion of his hair, which was cut quite short, and stood up
without parting all over his bullet-shaped head; he had a heavy and bristling moustache which
was cut short in a line with his lips.

"It is well," Walter thought to himself, "that it is my ransom rather than my life which is
dear to that evil-looking knight; for, assuredly, he is not one to hesitate did fortune throw
a foe into his hands."

At daybreak the march was resumed, and was continued until they reached the castle of Sir Phillip
Holbeaut, which stood on a narrow tongue of land formed by a sharp bend of the Somme.

On entering the castle the knight gave an order to his followers, and the prisoners were at
once led to a narrow cell beneath one of the towers. Walter looked round indignantly when he
arrived there.

"This is a dungeon for a felon," he exclaimed, "not the apartment for a knight who has been
taken captive in fair fight. Tell your master that he is bound to award me honourable treatment,
and that unless he removes me instantly from this dungeon to a proper apartment, and treats
me with all due respect and courtesy, I will, when I regain liberty, proclaim him a dishonoured
knight."

The men-at-arms made no reply; but, locking the door behind them, left the prisoners alone.

"What can this mean, Ralph?" Walter exclaimed. "We are in the lowest dungeon, and below the
level of the river. See how damp are the walls, and the floor is thick with slimy mud. The
river must run but just below that loophole, and in times of flood probably enters here."

Phillip of Holbeaut, on dismounting, ascended to an upper chamber, where a man in the dress
of a well-to-do citizen was sitting.

"Well, Sir Phillip," he exclaimed, rising to his feet as the other entered, "what news?"

"The news is bad," the knight growled. "This famous scheme of yours has cost me fifty of my
best men. I would I had had nothing to do with it."

"But this Walter Somers," the other exclaimed, "what of him? He has not escaped surely! The
force which marched from Amiens was large enough to have eaten him and his garrison.

"He has not escaped," the knight replied.

"Then he is killed!" the other said eagerly.

"No; nor is he killed. He is at present a prisoner in a dungeon below, together with a stout
knave whom he begged might accompany him until ransomed."

"All is well then," the other exclaimed. "Never mind the loss of your men. The money which
I have promised you for this business will hire you two hundred such knaves; but why didst
not knock him on head at once?"

"It was not so easy to knock him on the head," Sir Phillip growled. "It cost us five hundred
men to capture the outer walls, and to have fought our way into the keep, held, as it was,
by men who would have contested every foot of the ground, was not a job for which any of us
had much stomach, seeing what the first assaults had cost us; so the count took them all to
quarter. The rest he carried with him to Amiens; but their leader, according to the promise
which he made me, he handed over to me as my share of the day's booty, giving me every charge
that he should receive good and knightly treatment.

"Which, no doubt, you will observe," the other said, with an ugly laugh.

"It is a bad business," the knight exclaimed angrily, "and were it not for our friendship,
in Spain, and the memory of sundry deeds which we did together, not without profit to our purses,
I would rather that you were thrown over the battlements into the river than I had taken a
step in this business. However, none can say that Phillip of Holbeaut ever deserted a friend
who had proved true to him, not to mention that the sum which you promised me for my aid in
this matter will, at present time, prove wondrously convenient. Yet I foresee that it will
bring me into trouble with the Count of Evreux. Ere many days a demand will come for the fellow
to be delivered on ransom."

"And what will you say?" the other asked.

"I shall say what is the truth," the knight replied, "though I may add something that is not
wholly so. I shall say that he was drowned in the Somme. I shall add that it happened as he
was trying to make his escape, contrary to the parole he had given; but in truth he will be
drowned in the dungeon in which I have placed him, which has rid me of many a troublesome prisoner
before now. The river is at ordinary times but two feet below the loophole; and when its tide
is swelled by rain it often rises above the sill, and then there is an end of any one within.
They can doubt my word; but there are not many who would care to do so openly; none who would
do so for the sake of an unknown English knight. And as for any complaints on the part of the
Black Prince, King Phillip has shown over and over again how little the complaints of Edward
himself move him."

"It were almost better to knock him on head at once," the other said thoughtfully; "the fellow
has as many lives as a cat.

"If he had as many as nine cats," the knight replied, "it would not avail him. But I will have
no violence. The water will do your work as well as a poinard, and I will not have it said,
even among such ruffians as mine, that I slew a captured knight. The other will pass as an
accident, and I care not what my men may think as long as they can say nothing for a surety.
The count may storm as much as he will, and may even lay a complaint against me before the
king; but in times like the present, even a simple knight who can lead two hundred good fighting
men into the field is not to be despised, and the king is likely to be easily satisfied with
my replies to any question that may be raised. Indeed, it would seem contrary to reason that
I should slay a captive against whom I have no cause of quarrel, and so forfeit the ransom
which I should get for him."

"But suppose that a messenger should come offering ransom before the river happens to rise?"

"Then I shall anticipate matters, and shall say that what I know will happen has already taken
place. Do not be uneasy, Sir James. You have my word in the matter, and now I have gone so
far I shall carry it through. From the moment when I ordered him into that dungeon his fate
was sealed, and in truth, when I gave the order I did so to put an end to the indecision in
which my mind had been all night. Once in there he could not be allowed to come out alive,
for his report of such treatment would do me more harm among those of my own station in France
than any rumours touching his end could do. It is no uncommon affair for one to remove an enemy
from one's path; but cruelty to a knightly prisoner would be regarded with horror. Would you
like to have a look at him?"

The other hesitated. "No," he replied. "Against him personally I have no great grudge. He has
thwarted my plans, and stands now grievously in the way of my making fresh ones; but as he
did so from no ill-will towards myself, but as it were by hazard, I have no personal hatred
towards him, though I would fain remove him from my path. Besides, I tell you fairly, that
even in that dungeon where you have thrown him I shall not feel that he is safe until you send
me word that he is dead. He has twice already got out of scrapes when other men would have
been killed. Both at Vannes and at Ghent he escaped in a marvellous way; and but a few weeks
since, by the accident of his having a coat of mail under his doublet he saved his life from
as fair a blow as ever was struck. Therefore I would not that he knew aught of my having a
hand in this matter, for if after having seen me he made his escape I could never show my face
in England again. I should advise you to bid three or four men always enter his cell together,
for he and that man-of-arms who follows him like a shadow are capable of playing any desperate
trick to escape.

"That matter is easily enough managed," Sir Phillip said grimly, "by no one entering the dungeon
at all. The river may be slow of rising, though in sooth the sky looks overcast now, and it
is already at its usual winter level; and whether he dies from lack of water or from a too
abundant supply matters but little to me; only, as I told you I will give no orders for him
to be killed. Dost remember that Jew we carried off from Seville and kept without water until
he agreed to pay us a ransom which made us both rich for six months? That was a rare haul,
and I would that rich Jews were plentiful in this country.

"Yes, those were good times," the other said, "although I own that I have not done badly since
the war began, having taken a count and three knights prisoners, and put them to ransom, and
having reaped a goodly share of plunder from your French burghers, else indeed I could not
have offered you so round a sum to settle this little matter for me. There are not many French
knights who have earned a count's ransom in the present war. And now I will take horse; here
is one-half of the sum I promised you, in gold nobles. I will send you the remainder on the
day when I get news from you that the matter is finished."

"Have your money ready in a week's time," the knight replied, taking the bag of gold which
the other placed on the table, "for by that time you will hear from me. I hope this will not
be the last business which we may do together; there ought to be plenty of good chances in
a war like this. Any time that you can send me word of an intended foray by a small party under
a commander whose ransom would be a high one I will share what I get with you; and similarly
I will let you know of any rich prize who may be pounced upon on the same terms.

"Agreed!" the other said. "We may do a good business together in that way. But you lie too
far away. If you move up as near as you can to Calais and let me know your whereabouts, so
that I could send or ride to you in a few hours, we might work together with no small profit."

"I will take the field as soon as this affair of yours is settled," the knight replied; "and
the messenger who brings you the news shall tell you where I may be found. And now, while your
horse is being got ready, let us drink a stoup of wine together in memory of old times, though,
for myself, these wines of ours are poor and insipid beside the fiery juice of Spain."

While this conversation, upon which their fate so much depended, had been going on, Walter
and Ralph had been discussing the situation, and had arrived at a tolerably correct conclusion.

"This conduct on the part of this brutal French knight, Ralph, is so strange that methinks
it cannot be the mere outcome of his passions or of hate against me as an Englishman, but of
some deeper motive; and we were right in thinking that in bargaining for my person with the
Count of Evreux it was more than my ransom which he sought. Had that been his only object he
would never have thrown us into this noisome dungeon, for my report of such treatment would
bring dishonour upon him in the eyes of every knight and noble in France as well as in England.
It must be my life he aims at, although what grudge he can have against me it passes me to
imagine. It may be that at Cressy or elsewhere some dear relative of his may have fallen by
my sword; and yet were it so, men nourish no grudge for the death of those killed in fair fight.
But this boots not at present. It is enough for us that it is my life which he aims at, and
I fear, Ralph, that yours must be included with mine, since he would never let a witness escape
to carry the foul tale against him. This being so, the agreement on which I surrendered is
broken, and I am free to make my escape if I can, and methinks the sooner that be attempted
the better.

"So let us work to plan how we may best get out of this place. After our escape from that well
at Vannes we need not despair about breaking out from this dungeon of Holbeaut."

"We might overpower the guard who brings our food," Ralph said.

"There is that chance," Walter rejoined, "but I think it is a poor one. They may be sure that
this dishonourable treatment will have rendered us desperate, and they will take every precaution
and come well armed. It may be, too, that they will not come at all, but that they intend us
to die of starvation, or perchance to be drowned by the floods, which it is easy to see often
make their way in here. No, our escape, if escape there be, must be made through that loophole
above. Were that bar removed, methinks it is wide enough for us to squeeze through. Doubtless
such a hazard has not occurred to them, seeing that it is nigh twelve feet above the floor,
and that a single man could by no possibility reach it, but with two of us there is no difficulty.
Now, Ralph, do you stand against the wall. I will climb upon your shoulders, and standing there
can reach the bar, and so haul myself up and look out."

This was soon done, and Walter seizing the bar, hauled himself up so that he could see through
the loophole.

"It is as I thought," he said. "The waters of the Somme are but a foot below the level of this
window; the river is yellow and swollen, and a few hours' heavy rain would bring it above the
level of this sill. Stand steady, Ralph, I am coming down again."

When he reached the ground, he said:

"Take off your belt, Ralph; if we buckle that and mine together, passing it round the bar,
it will make a loop upon which we can stand at the window and see how best we can loosen the
bar. Constantly wet as it is, it is likely that the mortar will have softened, in which case
we shall have little difficulty in working it out."

The plan was at once put into execution; the belts were fastened together and Walter standing
on Ralph's shoulders passed one end around the bar and buckled it to the other, thus making
a loop some three feet in length; putting a foot in this he was able to stand easily at the
loophole.

"It is put in with mortar at the top, Ralph, and the mortar has rotted with the wet, but at
the bottom lead was poured in when the bar was set and this must be scooped out before it can
be moved. Fortunately the knight gave no orders to his men to remove our daggers when we were
thrust in here, and these will speedily dig out the lead; but I must come down first, for the
strap prevents my working at the foot of the bar. We must tear off a strip of our clothing
and make a shift to fasten the strap half-way up the bar so as not to slip down with our weight."

In order to accomplish this Walter had to stand upon Ralph's head to gain additional height.
He presently, after several attempts, succeeded in fixing the strap firmly against the bar
half-way up, and then placing one knee in the loop and putting an arm through the bar to steady
himself, he set to work at the lead. The sharp point of the dagger quickly cut out that near
the surface, but farther down the hole narrowed and the task was much more difficult. Several
times Ralph relieved him at the work, but at last it was accomplished, and the bar was found
to move slightly when they shook it. There now remained only to loosen the cement above, and
this was a comparatively easy task; it crumbled quickly before the points of their daggers,
and the bar was soon free to move.

"Now," Walter said, "we have to find out whether the bar was first put in from below or from
above; one hole or the other must be a good deal deeper than the iron, so that it was either
shoved up or pushed down until the other end could get under or over the other hole. I should
think most likely the hole is below, as if they held up the bar against the top, when the lead
was poured in it would fill up the space; so we will first of all try to lift it. I must stand
on your head again to enable me to be high enough to try this."

"My head is strong enough, I warrant," Ralph replied, "but I will fold up my jerkin, and put
on it, for in truth you hurt me somewhat when you were tying the strap to the bar."

All Walter's efforts did not succeed in raising the bar in the slightest, and he therefore
concluded that it had been inserted here and lifted while the space was filled with lead. "It
is best so," he said; "we should have to cut away the stone either above or below, and can
work much better below. Now I will put my knee in the strap again and set to work. The stone
seems greatly softened by the wet, and will yield to our daggers readily enough. It is already
getting dark, and as soon as we have finished we can start."

As Walter had discovered, the stone was rotten with the action of the weather, and although
as they got deeper it became much harder, it yielded to the constant chipping with their daggers,
and in two hours Ralph, who at the moment happened to be engaged, announced to Walter that
his dagger had found its way under the bottom of the bar. The groove was soon made deep enough
for the bar to be moved out; but another hour's work was necessary, somewhat further to enlarge
the upper hole, so as to allow the bar to have sufficient play. Fortunately it was only inserted
about an inch and a half in the stone, and the amount to be cut away to give it sufficient
play was therefore not large. Then at last all was ready for their flight.

CHAPTER XVII: THE CAPTURE OF CALAIS

When the bar was once ready for removal the captives delayed not a minute, for although it
was now so late that there was little chance of a visit being paid them, it was just possible
that such might be the case, and that it might occur to the knight that it would be safer to
separate them.

"Now, Ralph, do you go first, since I am lighter and can climb up by means of the strap, which
you can hold from above; push the bar out and lay it down quietly on the thickness of the wall.
A splash might attract the attention of the sentries, though I doubt whether it would, for
the wind is high and the rain falling fast. Unbuckle the strap before you move the bar, as
otherwise it might fall and I should have difficulty in handing it to you again. Now, I am
steady against the wall."

Ralph seized the bar and with a great effort pushed the bottom from him. It moved through the
groove without much difficulty, but it needed a great wrench to free the upper end. However,
it was done, and laying it quietly down he pulled himself up and thrust himself through the
loophole. It was a desperate struggle to get through, for it was only just wide enough for
his head to pass, and he was so squarely built that his body with difficulty followed. The
wall was four feet wide, and as the loophole widened considerably without, there was, when
he had once passed through from the inside, space enough for him to kneel down and lower one
end of the strap to Walter. Her nervousness and awareness were strive to fairest was resemble feeling,

 The king's countenance alone remained unchanged, and
he ordered them to be taken to instant execution. Then Sir Walter Manny and all the nobles
with tears besought the king to have mercy, not only for the sake of the citizens, but for
that of his own fame, which would be tarnished by so cruel a deed.

"Silence, Sir Walter!" cried the king. "Let the executioner be called. The men of Calais have
put to death so many of my subjects that I will also put these men to death."

At this moment Queen Philippa, who had been weeping bitterly, cast herself upon her knees before
the king. "Oh, gentle lord," she cried, "since I have repassed the seas to see you I have neither
asked or required anything at your hand; now, then, I pray you humbly, and require as a boon,
that for the sake of the Son of Mary, and for the love of me, you take these men to mercy."

The king stood for a moment in silence, and then said:

"Ah! lady, I would that you had been other where than here; but you beg of me so earnestly
I must not refuse you, though I grant your prayer with pain. I give them to you; take them,
and do your will."

Then the queen rose from her knees, and bidding the burghers rise, she caused clothing and
food to be given them, and sent them away free.

Sir Walter Manny, with a considerable body of men-at-arms, now took possession of the town
of Calais. The anger of the king soon gave way to better feelings; all the citizens, without
exception, were fed by his bounty. Such of them as preferred to depart instead of swearing
fealty to the English monarch were allowed to carry away what effects they could bear upon
their persons and were conducted in safety to the French town of Guisnes. Eustace de St. Pierre
was granted almost all the possessions he had formerly held in Calais, and also a considerable
pension; and he and all who were willing to remain were well and kindly treated. The number
was large, for the natural indignation which they felt at their base desertion by the French
king induced very many of the citizens to remain and become subjects of Edward. The king issued
a proclamation inviting English traders and others to come across and take up their residence
in Calais, bestowing upon them the houses and lands of the French who had left. Very many accepted
the invitation, and Calais henceforth and for some centuries became virtually an English town.

A truce was now, through the exertions of the pope's legates, made between England and France,
the terms agreed on being very similar to those of the previous treaty; and when all his arrangements
were finished Edward returned with his queen to England, having been absent eighteen months,
during which time almost unbroken success had attended his arms, and the English name had reached
a position of respect and honour in the eyes of Europe far beyond that at which it previously
stood.

CHAPTER XVIII: THE BLACK DEATH

The court at Westminster during the few months which followed the capture of Calais was the
most brilliant in Europe. Tournaments and fetes followed each other in rapid succession, and
to these knights came from all parts. So great was the reputation of King Edward that deputies
came from Germany, where the throne was now vacant, to offer the crown of that kingdom to him.
The king declined the offer, for it would have been impossible indeed for him to have united
the German crown with that of England, which he already held, and that of France, which he claimed.

Some months after his return to England the Black Prince asked his father as a boon that the
hand of his ward Edith Vernon should be bestowed upon the prince's brave follower Sir Walter
Somers, and as Queen Philippa, in the name of the lady's mother, seconded the request, the
king at once acceded to it. Edith was now sixteen, an age at which, in those days, a young
lady was considered to be marriageable, and the wedding took place with great pomp and ceremony
at Westminster; the king himself giving away the bride, and bestowing, as did the prince and
Queen Philippa, many costly presents upon the young couple. After taking part in several of
the tournaments, Walter went with his bride and Dame Vernon down to their estates, and were
received with great rejoicing by the tenantry, the older of whom well remembered Walter's father
and mother, and were rejoiced at finding that they were again to become the vassals of one
of the old family. Dame Vernon was greatly loved by her tenantry; but the latter had looked
forward with some apprehension to the marriage of the young heiress, as the character of the
knight upon whom the king might bestow her hand would greatly affect the happiness and well
being of his tenants.

Sir James Carnegie had not returned to England after the fall of Calais; he perceived that
he was in grave disfavour with the Black Prince, and guessed, as was the case, that some suspicion
had fallen on him in reference to the attack upon Walter in the camp, and to the strange attempt
which had been made to destroy him by Sir Phillip Holbeaut. He had, therefore, for a time taken
service with the Count of Savoy, and was away from England, to the satisfaction of Walter and
Dame Vernon, when the marriage took place; for he had given proofs of such a malignity of disposition
that both felt, that although his succession to the estates was now hopelessly barred, yet
that he might at any moment attempt some desperate deed to satisfy his feeling of disappointment
and revenge.

In spite of the gaiety of the court of King Edward a cloud hung over the kingdom; for it was
threatened by a danger far more terrible than any combination of foes--a danger which no gallantry
upon the part of her king or warriors availed anything. With a slow and terrible march the
enemy was advancing from the East, where countless hosts had been slain. India, Arabia, Syria,
and Armenia had been well-nigh depopulated. In no country which the dread foe had invaded had
less than two-thirds of the population been slain; in some nine-tenths had perished. All sorts
of portents were reported to have accompanied its appearance in the East; where it was said
showers of serpents had fallen, strange and unknown insects had appeared in the atmosphere,
and clouds of sulphurous vapour had issued from the earth and enveloped whole provinces and
countries. For two or three years the appearance of this scourge had been heralded by strange
atmospheric disturbances; heavy rains and unusual floods, storms of thunder and lightning of
unheard-of violence, hail-showers of unparalleled duration and severity, had everywhere been
experienced, while in Italy and Germany violent earthquake shocks had been felt, and that at
places where no tradition existed of previous occurrences of the same kind.

From Asia it had spread to Africa and to Europe, affecting first the sea-shores and creeping
inland by the course of the rivers. Greece first felt its ravages, and Italy was not long in
experiencing them. In Venice more than 100,000 persons perished in a few months, and thence
spreading over the whole peninsula, not a town escaped the visitation. At Florence 60,000 people
were carried off, and at Lucca and Genoa, in Sicily, Sardinia, and Corsica it raged with equal
violence. France was assailed by way of Provence, and Avignon suffered especially. Of the English
college at that place not an individual was left, and 120 persons died in a single day in that
small city. Paris lost upwards of 50,000 of its inhabitants, while 90,000 were swept away in
Lubeck, and 1,200,000 died within a year of its first appearance in Germany.

In England the march of the pestilence westward was viewed with deep apprehension, and the
approaching danger was brought home to the people by the death of the Princess Joan, the king's
second daughter. She was affianced to Peter, the heir to the throne of Spain; and the bride,
who had not yet accomplished her fourteenth year, was sent over to Bordeaux with considerable
train of attendants in order to be united there to her promised husband. Scarcely had she reached
Bordeaux when she was attacked by the pestilence and died in a few hours. A few days later
the news spread through the country that the disease had appeared almost simultaneously at
several of the seaports in the south-west of England. Thence with great rapidity it spread
through the kingdom; proceeding through Gloucestershire and Oxfordshire it broke out in London,
and the ravages were no less severe than they had been on the Continent, the very lowest estimate
being that two-thirds of the population were swept away. Most of those attacked died within
a few hours of the seizure. If they survived for two days they generally rallied, but even
then many fell into a state of coma from which they never awoke.

No words can describe the terror and dismay caused by this the most destructive plague of which
there is any record in history. No remedies were of the slightest avail against it; flight
was impossible, for the loneliest hamlets suffered as severely as crowded towns, and frequently
not a single survivor was left. Men met the pestilence in various moods: the brave with fortitude,
the pious with resignation, the cowardly and turbulent with outbursts of despair and fury.
Among the lower classes the wildest rumours gained credence. Some assigned the pestilence to
witchcraft, others declared that the waters of the wells and streams had been poisoned. Serious
riots occurred in many places, and great numbers of people fell victims to the fury of the
mob under the suspicion of being connected in some way with the ravages of the pestilence.
The Jews, ever the objects of popular hostility, engendered by ignorance and superstition,
were among the chief sufferers. Bands of marauders wandered through the country plundering
the houses left empty by the death of all their occupants, and from end to end death and suffering
were universal.

Although all classes had suffered heavily the ravages of the disease were, as is always the
case, greater among the poor than among the rich, the insanitary conditions of their life,
and their coarser and commoner food rendering them more liable to its influence; no rank, however,
was exempted, and no less than three Archbishops of Canterbury were carried off in succession
by the pestilence within a year of its appearance.

During the months which succeeded his marriage Sir Walter Somers lived quietly and happily
with his wife at Westerham. It was not until late in the year that the plague approached the
neighbourhood. Walter had determined to await its approach there. He had paid a few short visits
to the court, where every effort was made by continuous gaiety to keep up the spirits of the
people and prevent them from brooding over the approaching pestilence; but when it was at hand
Walter and his wife agreed that they would rather share the lot of their tenants, whom their
presence and example might support and cheer in their need, than return to face it in London.
One morning when they were at breakfast a frightened servant brought in the news that the disease
had appeared in the village, that three persons had been taken ill on the previous night, that
two had already died, and that several others had sickened.

"The time has come, my children," Dame Vernon said calmly, "the danger so long foreseen is
at hand, now let us face it as we agreed to do. It has been proved that flight is useless,
since nowhere is there escape from the plague; here, at least, there shall be no repetition
of the terrible scenes we have heard of elsewhere, where the living have fled in panic and
allowed the stricken to die unattended. We have already agreed that we will set the example
to our people by ourselves going down and administering to the sick."

"It is hard," Walter said, rising and pacing up and down the room, "to let Edith go into it."

"Edith will do just the same as you do," his wife said firmly. "Were it possible that all in
this house might escape, there might be a motive for turning coward, but seeing that no household
is spared, there is, as we agreed, greater danger in flying from the pestilence than facing
it firmly."

Walter sighed.

"You are right," he said, "but it wrings my heart to see you place yourself in danger."

"Were we out of danger here, Walter, it might be so," Edith replied gently; "but since there
is no more safety in the castle than in the cottage, we must face death whether it pleases
us or not, and it were best to do so bravely."

"So be it," Walter said; "may the God of heaven watch over us all! Now, mother, do you and
Edith busy yourselves in preparing broths, strengthening drinks, and medicaments. I will go
down at once to the village and see how matters stand there and who are in need. We have already
urged upon all our people to face the danger bravely, and if die they must, to die bravely
like Christians, and not like coward dogs. When you have prepared your soups and cordials come
down and meet me in the village, bringing Mabel and Janet, your attendants, to carry the baskets."

Ralph, who was now installed as major-domo in the castle, at once set out with Walter. They
found the village in a state of panic. Women were sitting crying despairingly at their doors.
Some were engaged in packing their belongings in carts preparatory to flight, some wandered
aimlessly about wringing their hands, while others went to the church, whose bells were mournfully
tolling the dirge of the departed. Walter's presence soon restored something like order and
confidence; his resolute tone cheered the timid and gave hope to the despairing. Sternly he
rebuked those preparing to fly, and ordered them instantly to replace their goods in their
houses. Then he went to the priest and implored him to cause the tolling of the bell to cease.

"There is enough," he said, "in the real danger present to appall even the bravest, and we
need no bell to tell us that death is among us. The dismal tolling is enough to unnerve the
stoutest heart, and if we ring for all who die its sounds will never cease while the plague
is among us; therefore, father, I implore you to discontinue it. Let there be services held
daily in the church, but I beseech you strive in your discourses to cheer the people rather
than to depress them, and to dwell more upon the joys that await those who die as Christian
men and women than upon the sorrows of those who remain behind. My wife and mother will anon
be down in the village and will strive to cheer and comfort the people, and I look to you for
aid in this matter."

The priest, who was naturally a timid man, nevertheless nerved himself to carry out Walter's
suggestions, and soon the dismal tones of the bell ceased to be heard in the village.

Walter despatched messengers to all the outlying farms desiring his tenants to meet him that
afternoon at the castle in order that measures might be concerted for common aid and assistance.
An hour later Dame Vernon and Edith came down and visited all the houses where the plague had
made its appearance, distributing their soups, and by cheering and comforting words raising
the spirits of the relatives of the sufferers.

The names of all the women ready to aid in the general work of nursing were taken down, and
in the afternoon at the meeting at the castle the full arrangements were completed. Work was
to be carried on as usual in order to occupy men's minds and prevent them from brooding over
the ravages of the plague. Information of any case that occurred was to be sent to the castle,
where soups and medicines were to be obtained. Whenever more assistance was required than could
be furnished by the inmates of a house another woman was to be sent to aid. Boys were told
off as messengers to fetch food and other matters as required from the castle.

So, bravely and firmly, they prepared to meet the pestilence; it spread with terrible severity.
Scarce a house which did not lose some of its inmates, while in others whole families were
swept away. All day Walter and his wife and Dame Vernon went from house to house, and although
they could do nothing to stem the progress of the pestilence, their presence and example supported
the survivors and prevented the occurrence of any of the panic and disorder which in most places
accompanied it.

The castle was not exempt from the scourge. First some of the domestics were seized, and three
men and four women died. Walter himself was attacked, but he took it lightly, and three days
after the seizure passed into a state of convalescence. Dame Vernon was next attacked, and
expired six hours after the commencement of the seizure. Scarcely was Walter upon his feet
than Ralph, who had not for a moment left his bedside, was seized, but he too, after being
at death's door for some hours, turned the corner. Lastly Edith sickened.

By this time the scourge had done its worst in the village, and three-fifths of the population
had been swept away. All the male retainers in the castle had died, and the one female who
survived was nursing her dying mother in the village.

Edith's attack was a very severe one. Walter, alone now, for Ralph, although convalescent,
had not yet left his bed, sat by his wife's bedside a prey to anxiety and grief; for although
she had resisted the first attack she was now, thirty-six hours after it had seized her, fast
sinking. Gradually her sight and power of speech faded, and she sank into the state of coma
which was the prelude of death, and lay quiet and motionless, seeming as if life had already
departed. Suddenly Walter was surprised by the sound of many heavy feet ascending the stairs.
He went out into the ante-room to learn the cause of this strange tumult, when five armed men,
one of whom was masked, rushed into the room. Walter caught up his sword from the table.

"Ruffians," he exclaimed, "how dare you desecrate the abode of death?"

Without a word the men sprang upon him. For a minute he defended himself against their attacks,
but he was still weak, his guard was beaten down, and a blow felled him to the ground.

"Now settle her," the masked man exclaimed, and the band rushed into the adjoining room. They
paused, however, at the door at the sight of the lifeless figure on the couch.

"We are saved that trouble," one said, "we have come too late."

The masked figure approached the couch and bent over the figure.

"Yes," he said, "she is dead, and so much the better."

Then he returned with the others to Walter.

"He breathes yet," he said. "He needs a harder blow than that you gave him to finish him. Let
him lie here for a while, while you gather your booty together; then we will carry him off.
There is scarcely a soul alive in the country round, and none will note us as we pass. I would
not despatch him here, seeing that his body would be found with wounds upon it, and even in
these times some inquiry might be made; therefore it were best to finish him elsewhere. When
he is missed it will be supposed that he went mad at the death of his wife, and has wandered
out and died, may be in the woods, or has drowned himself in a pond or stream. Besides, I would
that before he dies he should know what hand has struck the blow, and that my vengeance, which
he slighted and has twice escaped, has overtaken him at last."

After ransacking the principal rooms and taking all that was valuable, the band of marauders
lifted the still insensible body of Walter, and carrying it down-stairs flung it across a horse.
One of the ruffians mounted behind it, and the others also getting into their saddles the party
rode away.

They were mistaken, however, in supposing that the Lady Edith was dead. She was indeed very
nigh the gates of death, and had it not been for the disturbance would assuredly have speedily
entered them. The voice of her husband raised in anger, the clash of steel, followed by the
heavy fall, had awakened her deadened brain. Consciousness had at once returned to her, but
as yet no power of movement. As at a great distance she had heard the words of those who entered
her chamber, and had understood their import. More and more distinctly she heard their movements
about the room as they burst open her caskets and appropriated her jewels, but it was not until
silence was restored that the gathering powers of life asserted themselves; then with a sudden
rush the blood seemed to course through her veins, her eyes opened, and her tongue was loosed,
and with a scream she sprang up and stood by the side of her bed.

Sustained as by a supernatural power she hurried into the next room. A pool of blood on the
floor showed her that what she had heard had not been a dream or the fiction of a disordered
brain. Snatching up a cloak of her husband's which lay on a couch, she wrapped it round her,
and with hurried steps made her way along the passages until she reached the apartment occupied
by Ralph. The latter sprang up in bed with a cry of astonishment. He had heard but an hour
before from Walter that all hope was gone, and thought for an instant that the appearance was
an apparition from the dead. The ghastly pallor of the face, the eyes burning with a strange
light, the flowing hair, and disordered appearance of the girl might well have alarmed one
living in even less superstitious times, and Ralph began to cross himself hastily and to mutter
a prayer when recalled to himself by the sound of Edith's voice.

"Quick, Ralph!" she said, "arise and clothe yourself. Hasten, for your life. My lord's enemies
have fallen upon him and wounded him grievously, even if they have not slain him, and have
carried him away. They would have slain me also had they not thought I was already dead. Arise
and mount, summon everyone still alive in the village, and follow these murderers. I will pull
the alarm-bell of the castle."

Ralph sprang from his bed as Edith left. He had heard the sound of many footsteps in the knight's
apartments, but had deemed them those of the priest and his acolytes come to administer the
last rites of the church to his dying mistress. Rage and anxiety for his master gave strength
to his limbs. He threw on a few clothes and rushed down to the stables, where the horses stood
with great piles of forage and pails of water before them, placed there two days before, by
Walter when their last attendant died. Without waiting to saddle it, Ralph sprang upon the
back of one of the animals, and taking the halters of four others started at a gallop down
to the village.

His news spread like wild fire, for the ringing of the alarm-bell of the castle had drawn all
to their doors and prepared them for something strange. Some of the men had already taken their
arms and were making their way up to the castle when they met Ralph. There were but five men
in the village who had altogether escaped the pestilence; others had survived its attacks,
but were still weak. Horses there were in plenty. The five men mounted at once, with three
others who, though still weak, were able to ride.

So great was the excitement that seven women who had escaped the disease armed themselves with
their husbands' swords and leaped on horseback, declaring that, women though they were, they
would strike a blow for their beloved lord, who had been as an angel in the village during
the plague. Thus it was scarcely more than ten minutes after the marauders had left the castle
before a motley band, fifteen strong, headed by Ralph, rode off in pursuit, while some of the
women of the village hurried up to the castle to comfort Edith with the tidings that the pursuit
had already commenced. Fortunately a lad in the fields had noticed the five men ride away from
the castle, and was able to point out the direction they had taken.

At a furious gallop Ralph and his companions tore across the country. Mile after mile was passed.
Once or twice they gained news from labourers in the field of the passage of those before them,
and knew that they were on the right track. They had now entered a wild and sparsely inhabited
country. It was broken and much undulated, so that although they knew that the band they were
pursuing were but a short distance ahead they had not yet caught sight of them, and they hoped
that, having no reason to dread any immediate pursuit, these would soon slacken their pace.
This expectation was realized, for on coming over a brow they saw the party halted at a turf-burner's
cottage in the hollow below. Three of the men had dismounted; two of them were examining the
hoof of one of the horses, which had apparently cast a shoe or trodden upon a stone. Ralph
had warned his party to make no sound when they came upon the fugitives. The sound of the horses'
hoofs was deadened by the turf, and they were within a hundred yards of the marauders before
they were perceived; then Ralph uttered a shout and brandishing their swords the party rode
down at a headlong gallop.

The dismounted men leaped to their saddles and galloped off at full speed, but their pursuers
were now close upon them. Ralph and two of his companions, who were mounted upon Walter's best
horses, gained upon them at every stride. Two of them were overtaken and run through.

The man who bore Walter before him, finding himself being rapidly overtaken, threw his burden
on to the ground just as the leader of the party had checked his horse and was about to deliver
a sweeping blow at the insensible body.

With a curse at his follower for ridding himself of it, he again galloped on. The man's act
was unavailing to save himself, for he was overtaken and cut down before he had ridden many
strides; then Ralph and his party instantly reined up to examine the state of Walter, and the
two survivors of the band of murderers continued their flight unmolested.

CHAPTER XIX: BY LAND AND SEA

Walter was raised from the ground, water was fetched from the cottage, and the blood washed
from his head by Ralph, aided by two of the women. It had at once been seen that he was still
living, and Ralph on examining the wound joyfully declared that no great harm was done.

"Had Sir Walter been strong and well," he said, "such a clip as this would not have knocked
him from his feet, but he would have answered it with a blow such as I have often seen him
give in battle; but he was but barely recovering and was as weak as a girl. He is unconscious
from loss of blood and weakness. I warrant me that when he opens his eyes and hears that the
lady Edith has risen from her bed and came to send me to his rescue, joy will soon bring the
blood into his cheeks again. Do one of you run to the hut and see if they have any cordial
waters; since the plague has been raging there are few houses but have laid in a provision
in case the disease should seize them."

The man soon returned with a bottle of cordial water compounded of rosemary, lavender, and
other herbs. By this time Walter had opened his eyes. The cordial was poured down his throat,
and he was presently able to speak.

"Be of good cheer, Sir Walter," Ralph said; "three of your rascally assailants lie dead, and
the other two have fled; but I have better news still for you. Lady Edith, who you told me
lay unconscious and dying, has revived. The din of the conflict seems to have reached her ears
and recalled her to life, and the dear lady came to my room with the news that you were carried
off, and then, while I was throwing on my clothes, roused the village to your assistance by
ringing the alarm-bell. Rarely frightened I was when she came in, for methought at first it
was her spirit."

The good news, as Ralph had predicted, effectually roused Walter, and rising to his feet he
declared himself able to mount and ride back at once. Ralph tried to persuade him to wait until
they had formed a litter of boughs, but Walter would not allow it.

"I would not tarry an instant," he said, "for Edith will be full of anxiety until I return.
Why, Ralph, do you think that I am a baby? Why, you yourself were but this morning unable to
walk across the room, and here you have been galloping and fighting on my behalf."

"In faith," Ralph said, smiling, "until now I had forgotten that I had been ill."

"You have saved my life, Ralph, you and my friends here, whom I thank with all my heart for
what they have done. I will speak more to them another time, now I must ride home with all speed."

Walter now mounted; Ralph took his place on one side of him, and one of his tenants on the
other, lest he should be seized with faintness; then at a hand-gallop they started back for
the castle. Several women of the village had, when they left, hurried up to the castle. They
found Edith lying insensible by the rope of the alarm-bell, having fainted when she had accomplished
her object. They presently brought her round; as she was now suffering only from extreme weakness,
she was laid on a couch, and cordials and some soup were given to her. One of the women took
her place at the highest window to watch for the return of any belonging to the expedition.

Edith felt hopeful as to the result, for she thought that their assailants would not have troubled
to carry away the body of Walter had not life remained in it, and she was sure that Ralph would
press them so hotly that sooner or later the abductors would be overtaken.

An hour and a half passed, and then the woman from above ran down with the news that she could
see three horsemen galloping together towards the castle, with a number of others following
in confused order behind.

"Then they have found my lord," Edith exclaimed joyfully, "for Ralph would assuredly not return
so quickly had they not done so. It's a good sign that they are galloping, for had they been
bearers of ill news they would have returned more slowly; look out again and see if they are
bearing one among them."

The woman, with some of her companions, hastened away, and in two or three minutes ran down
with the news that Sir Walter himself was one of the three leading horsemen. In a few minutes
Edith was clasped in her husband's arms, and their joy, restored as they were from the dead
to each other, was indeed almost beyond words.

The plague now abated fast in Westerham, only two or three more persons being attacked by it.
As soon as Edith was sufficiently recovered to travel Walter proceeded with her to London and
there laid before the king and prince a complaint against Sir James Carnegie for his attempt
upon their lives. Even in the trance in which she lay, Edith had recognized the voice which
had once been so familiar to her. Walter, too, was able to testify against him, for the rough
jolting on horseback had for a while restored his consciousness, and he had heard words spoken,
before relapsing into insensibility from the continued bleeding of his wound, which enabled
him to swear to Sir James Carnegie as one of his abductors.

The king instantly ordered the arrest of the knight, but he could not be found; unavailing
search was made in every direction, and as nothing could be heard of him it was concluded that
he had left the kingdom. He was proclaimed publicly a false and villainous knight, his estates
were confiscated to the crown, and he himself was outlawed. Then Walter and his wife returned
home and did their best to assist their tenants in struggling through the difficulties entailed
through the plague.

So terrible had been the mortality that throughout England there was a lack of hands for field
work, crops rotted in the ground because there were none to harvest them, and men able to work
demanded twenty times the wages which had before been paid. So great was the trouble from this
source that an ordinance was passed by parliament enacting that severe punishment should be
dealt upon all who demanded wages above the standard price, and even more severe penalties
inflicted upon those who should consent to pay higher wages. It was, however, many years before
England recovered from the terrible blow which had been dealt her from the pestilence.

While Europe had been ravaged by pestilence the adherents of France and England had continued
their struggle in Brittany in spite of the terms of the truce, and this time King Edward was
the first open aggressor, granting money and assistance to the free companies, who pillaged
and plundered in the name of England. The truce expired at the end of 1348, but was continued
for short periods. It was, however, evident that both parties were determined ere long to recommence
hostilities. The French collected large forces in Artois and Picardy, and Edward himself proceeded
to Sandwich to organize there another army for the invasion of France.

Phillip determined to strike the first blow, and, before the conclusion of the truce, to regain
possession of Calais. This town was commanded by a Lombard officer named Almeric of Pavia.
Free communication existed, in consequence of the truce, between Calais and the surrounding
country, and Jeffrey de Charny, the governor of St. Omer, and one of the commissioners especially
appointed to maintain the truce, opened communications with the Lombard captain. Deeming that
like most mercenaries he would be willing to change sides should his interest to do so be made
clear, he offered him a large sum of money to deliver the castle to the French.

The Lombard at once agreed to the project. Jeffrey de Charny arranged to be within a certain
distance of the town on the night of the 1st of January, bringing with him sufficient forces
to master all opposition if the way was once opened to the interior of the town. It was further
agreed that the money was to be paid over by a small party of French who were to be sent forward
for the purpose of examining the castle, in order to ensure the main body against treachery.
As a hostage for the security of the detachment, the son of the governor was to remain in the
hands of the French without, until the safe return of the scouting party.

Several weeks elapsed between the conclusion of the agreement and the date fixed for its execution,
and in the meantime the Lombard, either from remorse or from a fear of the consequences which
might arise from a detection of the plot before its execution, or from the subsequent vengeance
of the English king, disclosed the whole transaction to Edward.

The king bade him continue to carry out his arrangements with De Charny, leaving it to him
to counteract the plot. Had he issued orders for the rapid assembly of the army the French
would have taken alarm. He therefore sent private messengers to a number of knights and gentlemen
of Kent and Sussex to meet him with their retainers at Dover on the 31st of December.

Walter was one of those summoned, and although much surprised at the secrecy with which he
was charged, and of such a call being made while the truce with France still existed, he repaired
to Dover on the day named, accompanied by Ralph and by twenty men, who were all who remained
capable of bearing arms on the estate.

He found the king himself with the Black Prince at Dover, where they had arrived that day.
Sir Walter Manny was in command of the force, which consisted in all of 300 men-at-arms and
600 archers. A number of small boats had been collected, and at midday on the 1st of January
the little expedition started, and arrived at Calais after nightfall.

In the chivalrous spirit of the times the king determined that Sir Walter Manny should continue
in command of the enterprise; he and the Black Prince, disguised as simple knights, fighting
under his banner.

In the meantime a considerable force had been collected at St. Omer, where a large number of
knights and gentlemen obeyed the summons of Jeffrey de Charny. On the night appointed they
marched for Calais, in number five hundred lances and a corresponding number of footmen. They
reached the river and bridge of Nieullay a little after midnight, and messengers were sent
on to the governor, who was prepared to receive them. On their report De Charny advanced still
nearer to the town, leaving the bridge and passages to the river guarded by a large body of
crossbow-men under the command of the Lord De Fiennes and a number of other knights. At a little
distance from the castle he was met by Almeric de Pavia, who yielded his son as a hostage according
to his promise, calculating, as was the case, that he would be recaptured by the English. Then,
having received the greater portion of the money agreed upon, he led a party of the French
over the castle to satisfy them of his sincerity. Upon receiving their report that all was
quiet De Charny detached twelve knights and a hundred men-at-arms to take possession of the
castle, while he himself waited at one of the gates of the town with the principal portion
of his force.

No sooner had the French entered the castle than the drawbridge was raised. The English soldiers
poured out from their places of concealment, and the party which had entered the castle were
forced to lay down their arms. In the meantime the Black Prince issued with a small body of
troops from a gate near the sea, while De Manny, with the king under his banner, marched by
the sally-port which led into the fields. A considerable detachment of the division was despatched
to dislodge the enemy at the bridge of Nieullay, and the rest, joining the party of the Black
Prince, advanced rapidly upon the forces of Jeffrey de Charny which, in point of numbers, was
double their own strength.

Although taken in turn by surprise the French prepared steadily for the attack. De Charny ordered
them all to dismount and to shorten their lances to pikes five feet in length. The English
also dismounted and rushing forward on foot a furious contest commenced. The ranks of both
parties were soon broken in the darkness, and the combatants separating into groups a number
of separate battles raged around the different banners.

For some hours the fight was continued with unabating obstinacy on both sides. The king and
the Black Prince fought with immense bravery, their example encouraging even those of their
soldiers who were ignorant of the personality of the knights who were everywhere in front of
the combat. King Edward himself several times crossed swords with the famous Eustace de Ribaumont,
one of the most gallant knights in France. At length towards daybreak the king, with only thirty
companions, found himself again opposed to De Ribaumont with a greatly superior force, and
the struggle was renewed between them.

Twice the king was beaten down on one knee by the thundering blows of the French knight, twice
he rose and renewed the attack, until De Charny, seeing Sir Walter Manny's banner, beside which
Edward fought, defended by so small a force, also bore down to the attack, and in the struggle
Edward was separated from his opponent.

The combat now became desperate round the king, and Sir Guy Brian, who bore De Manny's standard,
though one of the strongest and most gallant knights of the day, could scarce keep the banner
erect. Still Edward fought on, and in the excitement of the moment, forgetting his incognito,
he accompanied each blow with his customary war-cry--"Edward, St. George! Edward, St. George!"
At that battle-cry, which told the French men-at-arms that the King of England was himself
opposed to them, they recoiled for a moment. The shout too reached the ears of the Prince of
Wales, who had been fighting with another group. Calling his knights around him he fell upon
the rear of De Charny's party and quickly cleared a space around the king.

The fight was now everywhere going against the French, and the English redoubling their efforts
the victory was soon complete, and scarcely one French knight left the ground alive and free.
In the struggle Edward again encountered De Ribaumont, who, separated from him by the charge
of De Charny, had not heard the king's war-cry. The conflict between them was a short one.
The French knight saw that almost all his companions were dead or captured, his party completely
defeated, and all prospects of escape cut off. He therefore soon dropped the point of his sword
and surrendered to his unknown adversary. In the meantime the troops which had been despatched
to the bridge of Nieullay had defeated the French forces left to guard the passage and clear
the ground towards St. Omer.

Early in the morning Edward entered Calais in triumph, taking with him thirty French nobles
as prisoners, while two hundred more remained dead on the field. That evening a great banquet
was held, at which the French prisoners were present. The king presided at the banquet, and
the French nobles were waited upon by the Black Prince and his knights. After the feast was
concluded the king bestowed on De Ribaumont the chaplet of pearls which he wore round his crown,
hailing him as the most gallant of the knights who had that day fought, and granting him freedom
to return at once to his friends, presenting him with two horses, and a purse to defray his
expenses to the nearest French town.

De Charny was afterwards ransomed, and after his return to France assembled a body of troops
and attacked the castle which Edward had bestowed upon Almeric of Pavia, and capturing the
Lombard, carried him to St. Omer, and had him there publicly flayed alive as a punishment for
his treachery.

Walter had as usual fought by the side of the Prince of Wales throughout the battle of Calais
and had much distinguished himself for his valour. Ralph was severely wounded in the fight,
but was able a month later to rejoin Walter in England.

The battle of Calais and the chivalrous bearing of the king created great enthusiasm and delight
in England, and did much to rouse the people from the state of grief into which they had been
cast by the ravages of the plague. The king did his utmost to maintain the spirit which had
been evoked, and the foundation of the order of the Garter, and the erection of a splendid
chapel at Windsor, and its dedication, with great ceremony, to St. George, the patron saint
of England, still further raised the renown of the court of Edward throughout Europe as the
centre of the chivalry of the age.

Notwithstanding many treaties which had taken place, and the near alliance which had been well-nigh
carried out between the royal families of England and Spain, Spanish pirates had never ceased
to carry on a series of aggressions upon the English vessels trading in the Bay of Biscay.
Ships were every day taken, and the crews cruelly butchered in cold blood. Edward's remonstrances
proved vain, and when threats of retaliation were held out by Edward, followed by preparations
to carry those threats into effect, Pedro the Cruel, who had now succeeded to the throne of
Spain, despatched strong reinforcements to the fleet which had already swept the English Channel.

The great Spanish fleet sailed north, and capturing on its way a number of English merchantmen,
put into Sluys, and prepared to sail back in triumph with the prizes and merchandise it had
captured. Knowing, however, that Edward was preparing to oppose them, the Spaniards filled
up their complement of men, strengthened themselves by all sorts of the war machines then in
use, and started on their return for Spain with one of the most powerful armadas that had ever
put to sea.

Edward had collected on the coast of Sussex a fleet intended to oppose them, and had summoned
all the military forces of the south of England to accompany him; and as soon as he heard that
the Spaniards were about to put to sea he set out for Winchelsea, where the fleet was collected.

The queen accompanied him to the sea-coast, and the Black Prince, now in his twentieth year,
was appointed to command one of the largest of the English vessels.

The fleet put to sea when they heard that the Spaniards had started, and the hostile fleets
were soon in sight of each other. The number of fighting men on board the Spanish ships was
ten times those of the English, and their vessels were of vastly superior size and strength.
They had, moreover, caused their ships to be fitted at Sluys with large wooden towers, which
furnished a commanding position to their crossbow-men. The wind was direct in their favour,
and they could have easily avoided the contest, but, confiding in their enormously superior
force, they sailed boldly forward to the attack.

The king himself led the English line, and directing his vessel towards a large Spanish ship,
endeavoured to run her down. The shock was tremendous, but the enemy's vessel was stronger
as well as larger than that of the king; and as the two ships recoiled from each other it was
found that the water was rushing into the English vessel, and that she was rapidly sinking.
The Spanish passed on in the confusion, but the king ordered his ship to be instantly laid
alongside another which was following her, and to be firmly lashed to her. Then with his knights
he sprang on board the Spaniard, and after a short but desperate fight cut down or drove the
crew overboard. The royal standard was hoisted on the prize, the sinking English vessel was
cast adrift, and the king sailed on to attack another adversary.

The battle now raged on all sides. The English strove to grapple with and board the enemy,
while the Spaniards poured upon them a shower of bolts and quarrels from their cross-bows,
hurled immense masses of stone from their military engines, and, as they drew alongside, cast
into them heavy bars of iron, which pierced holes in the bottom of the ship.

Walter was on board the ship commanded by the Black Prince. This had been steered towards one
of the largest and most important of the Spanish vessels. As they approached, the engines poured
their missiles into them. Several great holes were torn in the sides of the ship, which was
already sinking as she came alongside her foe.

"We must do our best, Sir Walter," the prince exclaimed, "for if we do not capture her speedily
our ship will assuredly sink beneath our feet."

The Spaniard stood far higher above the water than the English ship, and the Black Prince and
his knights in vain attempted to climb her sides, while the seamen strove with pumps and buckets
to keep the vessel afloat. Every effort was in vain. The Spaniard's men-at-arms lined the bulwarks,
and repulsed every effort made by the English to climb up them, while those on the towers rained
down showers of bolts and arrows and masses of iron and stone. The situation was desperate
when the Earl of Lancaster, passing by in his ship, saw the peril to which the prince was exposed,
and, ranging up on the other side of the Spaniard, strove to board her there. The attention
of the Spaniards being thus distracted, the prince and his companions made another desperate
effort, and succeeded in winning their way on to the deck of the Spanish ship just as their
own vessel sank beneath their feet; after a few minutes' desperate fighting the Spanish ship
was captured.

The English were now everywhere getting the best of their enemies. Many of the Spanish vessels
had been captured or sunk, and after the fight had raged for some hours, the rest began to
disperse and seek safety in flight. The English vessel commanded by Count Robert of Namur had
towards night engaged a Spanish vessel of more than twice its own strength. His adversaries,
seeing that the day was lost, set all sail, but looking upon the little vessel beside them
as a prey to be taken possession of at their leisure, they fastened it tightly to their sides
by the grappling irons, and spreading all sail, made away. The Count and his men were unable
to free themselves, and were being dragged away, when a follower of the count named Hennekin
leapt suddenly on board the Spanish ship. With a bound he reached the mast, and with a single
blow with his sword cut the halyards which supported the main-sail. The sail fell at once.
The Spaniards rushed to the spot to repair the disaster which threatened to delay their ship.
The count and his followers, seeing the bulwarks of the Spanish vessel for the moment unguarded,
poured in, and after a furious conflict captured the vessel. By this time twenty-four of the
enemy's vessels had been taken, the rest were either sunk or in full flight, and Edward at
once returned to the English shore.

The fight had taken place within sight of land, and Queen Philippa, from the windows of the
abbey, which stood on rising ground, had seen the approach of the vast Spanish fleet, and had
watched the conflict until night fell. She remained in suspense as to the result until the
king himself with the Black Prince and Prince John, afterwards known as John of Gaunt, who,
although but ten years of age, had accompanied the Black Prince in his ship, rode up with the
news of the victory.

This great sea-fight was one of the brightest and most honourable in the annals of English
history, for not even in the case of that other great Spanish Armada which suffered defeat
in English waters were the odds so immense or the victory so thorough and complete. The result
of the fight was, that after some negotiations a truce of twenty years was concluded with Spain.

CHAPTER XX: POITIERS

After the great sea-fight at the end of August, 1350, England had peace for some years. Phillip
of France had died a week before that battle, and had been succeeded by his son John, Duke
of Normandy. Upon the part of both countries there was an indisposition to renew the war, for
their power had been vastly crippled by the devastations of the plague. This was followed by
great distress and scarcity owing to the want of labour to till the fields. The truce was therefore
continued from time to time; the pope strove to convert the truce into a permanent peace, and
on the 28th of August, 1354, a number of the prelates and barons of England, with full power
to arrange terms of peace, went to Avignon, where they were met by the French representatives.
The powers committed to the English commissioners show that Edward was at this time really
desirous of making a permanent peace with France; but the French ambassadors raised numerous
and unexpected difficulties, and after lengthened negotiations the conference was broken off.

The truce came to an end in June, 1355, and great preparations were made on both sides for
the war. The King of England strained every effort to furnish and equip an army which was to
proceed with the Black Prince to Aquitaine, of which province his father had appointed him
governor, and in November the Prince sailed for Bordeaux, with the advance-guard of his force.
Sir Walter Somers accompanied him. During the years which had passed since the plague he had
resided principally upon his estates, and had the satisfaction of seeing that his tenants escaped
the distress which was general through the country. He had been in the habit of repairing to
London to take part in the tournaments and other festivities; but both he and Edith preferred
the quiet country life to a continued residence at court. Two sons had now been born to him,
and fond as he was of the excitement and adventure of war, it was with deep regret that he
obeyed the royal summons, and left his house with his retainers, consisting of twenty men-at-arms
and thirty archers, to join the prince.

Upon the Black Prince's landing at Bordeaux he was joined by the Gascon lords, the vassals
of the English crown, and for three months marched through and ravaged the districts adjoining,
the French army, although greatly superior in force, offering no effectual resistance. Many
towns were taken, and he returned at Christmas to Bordeaux after a campaign attended by a series
of unbroken successes.

The following spring the war recommenced, and a diversion was effected by the Duke of Lancaster,
who was in command of Brittany, joining his forces with those of the King of Navarre, and many
of the nobles of Normandy, while King Edward crossed to Calais and kept a portion of the French
army occupied there. The Black Prince, leaving the principal part of his forces under the command
of the Earl of Albret to guard the territory already acquired against the attack of the French
army under the Count of Armagnac, marched with 2000 picked men-at-arms and 6000 archers into
Auvergne, and thence turning into Berry, marched to the gates of Bourges.

The King of France was now thoroughly alarmed, and issued a general call to all his vassals
to assemble on the Loire. The Prince of Wales, finding immense bodies of men closing in around
him, fell back slowly, capturing and levelling to the ground the strong castle of Romorentin.

The King of France was now hastening forward, accompanied by his four sons, 140 nobles with
banners, 20,000 men-at-arms, and an immense force of infantry. Vast accessions of forces joined
him each day, and on the 17th of September he occupied a position between the Black Prince
and Guienne. The first intimation that either the Black Prince or the King of France had of
their close proximity to each other was an accidental meeting between a small foraging force
of the English and three hundred French horse, under the command of the Counts of Auxerre and
Joigny, the marshal of Burgundy, and the lord of Chatillon. The French hotly pursued the little
English party, and on emerging from some low bushes found themselves in the midst of the English
camp, where all were taken prisoners. From them the Black Prince learned that the King of France
was within a day's march.

The Prince despatched the Captal de Buch with 200 men-at-arms to reconnoitre the force and
position of the enemy, and these coming upon the rear of the French army just as they were
about to enter Poitiers, dashed among them and took some prisoners. The King of France thus
first learned that the enemy he was searching for was actually six miles in his rear. The Captal
de Buch and his companions returned to the Black Prince, and confirmed the information obtained
from the prisoners, that the King of France, with an army at least eight times as strong as
his own, lay between him and Poitiers.

The position appeared well-nigh desperate, but the prince and his most experienced knights
at once reconnoitered the country to choose the best ground upon which to do battle. An excellent
position was chosen. It consisted of rising ground commanding the country towards Poitiers,
and naturally defended by the hedges of a vineyard. It was only accessible from Poitiers by
a sunken road flanked by banks and fences, and but wide enough to admit of four horsemen riding
abreast along it. The ground on either side of this hollow way was rough and broken so as to
impede the movements even of infantry, and to render the maneuvers of a large body of cavalry
nearly impracticable. On the left of the position was a little hamlet called Maupertuis. Here
on the night of Saturday the 17th of September the prince encamped, and early next morning
made his dispositions for the battle. His whole force was dismounted and occupied the high
ground, a strong body of archers lined the hedges on either side of the sunken road; the main
body of archers were drawn up in their usual formation on the hillside, their front covered
by the hedge of the vineyard, while behind them the men-at-arms were drawn up.

The King of France divided his army into three divisions, each consisting of 16,000 mounted
men-at-arms besides infantry, commanded respectively by the Duke of Orleans, the king's brother,
the dauphin, and the king himself. With the two royal princes were the most experienced of
the French commanders. In the meantime De Ribaumont, with three other French knights, reconnoitered
the English position, and on their return with their report strongly advised that as large
bodies of cavalry would be quite useless owing to the nature of the ground, the whole force
should dismount except 300 picked men designed to break the line of English archers and a small
body of German horse to act as a reserve.

Just as the King of France was about to give orders for the advance, the Cardinal of Perigord
arrived in his camp, anxious to stop, if possible, the effusion of blood. He hurried to the
King of France.

"You have here, sire," he said, "the flower of all the chivalry of your realm assembled against
a mere handful of English, and it will be far more honourable and profitable for you to have
them in your power without battle than to risk such a noble array in uncertain strife. I pray
you, then, in the name of God, to let me ride on to the Prince of Wales, to show him his peril,
and to exhort him to peace."

"Willingly, my lord," the king replied; "but above all things be quick."

The cardinal at once hastened to the English camp; he found the Black Prince in the midst of
his knights ready for battle, but by no means unwilling to listen to proposals for peace. His
position was indeed most perilous. In his face was an enormously superior army, and he was
moreover threatened by famine; even during the two preceding days his army had suffered from
a great scarcity of forage, and its provisions were almost wholly exhausted. The French force
was sufficiently numerous to blockade him in his camp, and he knew that did they adopt that
course he must surrender unconditionally, since were he forced to sally out and attack the
French no valour could compensate for the immense disparity of numbers. He therefore replied
at once to the cardinal's application, that he was ready to listen to any terms by which his
honour and that of his companions would be preserved.

The cardinal returned to the King of France and with much entreaty succeeded in obtaining a
truce until sunrise on the following morning. The soldiers returned to their tents, and the
cardinal rode backward and forward between the armies, beseeching the King of France to moderate
his demands, and the Black Prince to submit to the evil fortune which had befallen him; but
on the one side the king looked upon the victory as certain, and on the other the Black Prince
thought that there was at least a hope of success should the French attack him. All, therefore,
that the cardinal could obtain from him was an offer to resign all he had captured in his expedition,
towns, castles, and prisoners, and to take an oath not to bear arms against France for seven
years. This proposal fell so far short of the demands of the French king that pacification
soon appeared hopeless.

Early on the Monday morning the cardinal once more sought the presence of the French king,
but found John inflexible; while some of the leaders who had viewed with the strongest disapproval
his efforts to snatch what they regarded as certain victory from their hands, gave him a peremptory
warning not to show himself again in their lines. The prelate then bore the news of his failure
to the Prince of Wales. "Fair son," he said, "do the best you can, for you must needs fight,
as I can find no means of peace or amnesty with the King of France."

"Be it so, good father," the prince replied, "it is our full resolve to fight, and God will
aid the right."

The delay which had occurred had not been without advantages for the British army, although
the shortness of provisions was greatly felt. Every effort had been made to strengthen the
position. Deep trenches had been dug and palisades erected around it, and the carts and baggage
train had all been moved round so as to form a protection on the weakest side of the camp,
where also a rampart had been constructed.

Upon a careful examination of the ground it was found that the hill on the right side of the
camp was less difficult than had been supposed, and that the dismounted men-at-arms who lay
at its foot under the command of the Dauphin would find little difficulty in climbing it to
the assault. The prince therefore gave orders that 300 men-at-arms and 300 mounted archers
should make a circuit from the rear round the base of the hill, in order to pour in upon the
flank of the Dauphin's division as soon as they became disordered in the ascent. The nature
of the ground concealed this maneuver from the enemies' view, and the Captal De Buch, who was
in command of the party, gained unperceived the cover of a wooded ravine within a few hundred
yards of the left flank of the enemy. By the time that all these dispositions were complete
the huge French array was moving forward. The Black Prince, surrounded by his knights, viewed
them approaching.

"Fair lords," he said, "though we be so few against that mighty power of enemies, let us not
be dismayed, for strength and victory lie not in multitudes, but in those to whom God give
them. If He will the day be ours, then the highest glory of this world will be given to us.
If we die, I have the noble lord, my father, and two fair brothers, and you have each of you
many a good friend who will avenge us well; thus, then, I pray you fight well this day, and
if it please God and St. George I will also do the part of a good knight."

The prince then chose Sir John Chandos and Sir James Audley to remain by his side during the
conflict in order to afford him counsel in case of need. Audley, however, pleaded a vow which
he had made long before, to be the first in battle should he ever be engaged under the command
of the King of England or any of his children. The prince at once acceded to his request to
be allowed to fight in the van, and Audley, accompanied by four chosen squires, took his place
in front of the English line of battle. Not far from him, also in advance of the line, was
Sir Eustace D'Arnbrecicourt on horseback, also eager to distinguish himself.

As Sir James rode off the prince turned to Walter. "As Audley must needs fight as a knight-errant,
Sir Walter Somers, do you take your place by my side, for there is no more valiant knight in
my army than you have often proved yourself to be."

Three hundred chosen French men-at-arms mounted on the strongest horses covered with steel
armour, led the way under the command of the Marechals D'Audeham and De Clermont; while behind
them were a large body of German cavalry under the Counts of Nassau, Saarbruck, and Nidau,
to support them in their attack on the English archers. On the right was the Duke of Orleans
with 16,000 men-at-arms; on the left the Dauphin and his two brothers with an equal force;
while King John himself led on the rear-guard.

When the three hundred elite of the French army reached the narrow way between the hedges,
knowing that these were lined with archers they charged through at a gallop to fall upon the
main body of bowmen covering the front of the English men-at-arms. The moment they were fairly
in the hollow road the British archers rose on either side to their feet and poured such a
flight of arrows among them that in an instant all was confusion and disarray. Through every
joint and crevice of the armour of knights and horses the arrows found their way, and the lane
was almost choked with the bodies of men and horses. A considerable number, nevertheless, made
their way through and approached the first line of archers beyond. Here they were met by Sir
James Audley, who, with his four squires, plunged into their ranks and overthrew the Marechal
D'Audeham, and then fought his way onward. Regardless of the rest of the battle he pressed
ever forward, until at the end of the day, wounded in a hundred places and fainting from loss
of blood, he fell from his horse almost at the gates of Poitiers, and was borne from the field
by the four faithful squires who had fought beside him throughout the day.

Less fortunate was Sir Eustace D'Ambrecicourt, who spurred headlong upon the German cavalry.
A German knight rode out to meet him, and in the shock both were dishorsed, but before Sir
Eustace could recover his seat he was borne down to the ground by four others of the enemy,
and was bound and carried captive to the rear.

In the meantime the English archers kept up their incessant hail of arrows upon the band under
the French marshals. The English men-at-arms passed through the gaps purposely left in the
line of archers and drove back the front rank of the enemy upon those following, chasing them
headlong down the hollow road again. The few survivors of the French force, galloping back,
carried confusion into the advancing division of the Dauphin.

Before order was restored the Captal De Buch with his six hundred men issued forth from his
place of concealment and charged impetuously down on the left flank of the Dauphin. The French,
shaken in front by the retreat of their advance guard, were thrown into extreme confusion by
this sudden and unexpected charge. The horse archers with the captal poured their arrows into
the mass, while the shafts of the main body of the archers on the hill hailed upon them without
ceasing.

The rumour spread among those in the French rear, who were unable to see what was going forward,
that the day was already lost, and many began to fly. Sir John Chandos marked the confusion
which had set in, and he exclaimed to the prince:

"Now, sir, ride forward, and the day is yours. Let us charge right over upon your adversary,
the King of France, for there lies the labour and the feat of the day. Well do I know that
his great courage will never let him fly, but, God willing, he shall be well encountered."

"Forward, then, John Chandos," replied the prince. "You shall not see me tread one step back,
but ever in advance. Bear on my banner. God and St. George be with us!"

The horses of the English force were all held in readiness by their attendants close in their
rear. Every man sprang into his saddle, and with levelled lances the army bore down the hill
against the enemy, while the Captal De Buch forced his way through the struggling ranks of
the French to join them.

To these two parties were opposed the whole of the German cavalry, the division of the Dauphin,
now thinned by flight, and a strong force under the Constable de Brienne, Duke of Athens. The
first charge of the English was directed against the Germans, the remains of the marshal's
forces, and that commanded by the Constable. The two bodies of cavalry met with a tremendous
shock, raising their respective war-cries, "Denis Mount Joye!" and "St. George Guyenne!" Lances
were shivered, and horses and men rolled over, but the German horse was borne down in every
direction by the charge of the English chivalry. The Counts of Nassau and Saarbruck were taken,
and the rest driven down the hill in utter confusion. The division of the Duke of Orleans,
a little further down the hill to the right, were seized with a sudden panic, and 16,000 men-at-arms,
together with their commander, fled without striking a blow.

Having routed the French and German cavalry in advance, the English now fell upon the Dauphin's
division. This had been already confused by the attacks of the Captal De Buch, and when its
leaders beheld the complete rout of the marshals and the Germans, and saw the victorious force
galloping down upon them, the responsibility attached to the charge of the three young princes
overcame their firmness. The Lords of Landas, Vaudenay, and St. Venant, thinking the battle
lost, hurried the princes from the field, surrounded by eight hundred lances, determined to
place them at a secure distance, and then to return and fight beside the king. The retreat
of the princes at once disorganized the force, but though many fled a number of the nobles
remained scattered over the field fighting in separate bodies with their own retainers gathered
under their banners. Gradually these fell back and took post on the left of the French king's
division. The Constable and the Duke of Bourbon with a large body of knights and men-at-arms
also opposed a firm front to the advance of the English. The king saw with indignation one
of his divisions defeated and the other in coward flight, but his forces were still vastly
superior to those of the English, and ordering his men to dismount, he prepared to receive
their onset. The English now gathered their forces which had been scattered in combat, and
again advanced to the fight. The archers as usual heralded this advance with showers of arrows,
which shook the ranks of the French and opened the way for the cavalry. These dashed in, and
the ranks of the two armies became mixed, and each man fought hand to hand. The French king
fought on foot with immense valour and bravery, as did his nobles. The Dukes of Bourbon and
Athens, the Lords of Landas, Argenton, Chambery, Joinville, and many others stood and died
near the king.

Gradually the English drove back their foes. The French forces became cut up into groups or
confined into narrow spaces. Knight after knight fell around the king. De Ribaumont fell near
him. Jeffrey de Charny, who, as one of the most valiant knights in the army, had been chosen
to bear the French standard, the oriflamme, never left his sovereign's side, and as long as
the sacred banner floated over his head John would not believe the day was lost. At length,
however, Jeffrey de Charny was killed, and the oriflamme fell. John, surrounded on every side
by foes who pressed forward to make him prisoner, still kept clear the space immediately around
himself and his little son with his battle-axe; but at last he saw that further resistance
would only entail the death of both, and he then surrendered to Denis de Montbec, a knight
of Artois.

The battle was now virtually over. The French banners and pennons had disappeared, and nothing
was seen save the dead and dying, groups of prisoners, and parties of fugitives flying over
the country. Chandos now advised the prince to halt. His banner was pitched on the summit of
a little mound. The trumpets blew to recall the army from the pursuit, and the prince, taking
off his helmet, drank with the little body of knights who accompanied him some wine brought
from his former encampment.

The two marshals of the English army, the Earls of Warwick and Suffolk, were among the first
to return at the call of the trumpet. Hearing that King John had certainly not left the field
of battle, though they knew not whether he was dead or taken, the prince at once despatched
the Earl of Warwick and Lord Cobham to find and protect him if still alive. They soon came
upon a mass of men-at-arms, seemingly engaged in an angry quarrel. On riding up they found
that the object of strife was the King of France, who had been snatched from the hands of Montbec,
and was being claimed by a score of men as his prisoner. The Earl of Warwick and Lord Cobham
instantly made their way through the mass, and dismounting, saluted the captive monarch with
the deepest reverence, and keeping back the multitude led him to the Prince of Wales. The latter
bent his knee before the king, and calling for wine, presented the cup with his own hands to
the unfortunate monarch.

The battle was over by noon, but it was evening before all the pursuing parties returned, and
the result of the victory was then fully known. With less than 8000 men the English had conquered
far more than 60,000. On the English side 2000 men-at-arms and 1500 archers had fallen. Upon
the French side 11,000 men-at-arms, besides an immense number of footmen, had been killed.
A king, a prince, an archbishop, 13 counts, 66 barons, and more than 2000 knights were prisoners
in the hands of the English, with a number of other soldiers, who raised the number of captives
to double that of their conquerors. All the baggage of the French army was taken, and as the
barons of France had marched to the field feeling certain of victory, and the rich armour of
the prisoners became immediately the property of the captors, immense stores of valuable ornaments
of all kinds, especially jewelled baldrics, enriched the meanest soldier among the conquerors.

The helmet which the French king had worn, which bore a small coronet of gold beneath the crest,
was delivered to the Prince of Wales, who sent it off at once to his father as the best trophy
of the battle he could offer him.

Its receipt was the first intimation which Edward III received of the great victory.

As the prince had no means of providing for the immense number of prisoners, the greater portion
were set at liberty upon their taking an oath to present themselves at Bordeaux by the ensuing
Christmas in order either to pay the ransom appointed, or to again yield themselves as prisoners.

Immediately the battle was over, Edward sent for the gallant Sir James Audley, who was brought
to him on his litter by his esquires, and the prince, after warmly congratulating him on the
honour that he had that day won as the bravest knight in the army, assigned him an annuity
of five hundred marks a year.

No sooner was Audley taken to his own tent than he called round him several of his nearest
relations and friends, and then and there made over to his four gallant attendants, without
power of recall, the gift which the prince had bestowed upon him. The prince was not to be
outdone, however, in liberality, and on hearing that Audley had assigned his present to the
brave men who had so gallantly supported him in the fight, he presented Sir James with another
annuity of six hundred marks a year.

CHAPTER XXI: THE JACQUERIE

ON the evening after the battle of Poitiers a splendid entertainment was served in the tent
of the Prince of Wales to the King of France and all the principal prisoners. John, with his
son and six of his highest nobles were seated at a table raised above the rest, and the prince
himself waited as page upon the French king. John in vain endeavoured to persuade the prince
to be seated; the latter refused, saying, that it was his pleasure as well as his duty to wait
upon one who had shown himself to be the best and bravest knight in the French army. The example
of the Black Prince was contagious, and the English vied with each other in generous treatment
of their prisoners. All were treated as friends, and that night an immense number of knights
and squires were admitted to ransom on such terms as had never before been known. The captors
simply required their prisoners to declare in good faith what they could afford to pay without
pressing themselves too hard, "for they did not wish," they said, "to ransom knights or squires
on terms which would prevent them from maintaining their station in society, from serving their
lords, or from riding forth in arms to advance their name and honour."

Upon the following morning solemn thanksgivings were offered up on the field of battle for
the glorious victory. Then the English army, striking its tents, marched back towards Bordeaux.
They were unmolested upon this march, for although the divisions of the Dauphin and the Duke
of Orleans had now reunited, and were immensely superior in numbers to the English, encumbered
as the latter were, moreover, with prisoners and booty, the tremendous defeat which they had
suffered, and still more the capture of the king, paralysed the French commanders, and the
English reached Bordeaux without striking another blow.

Not long after they reached that city the Cardinal of Perigord and another legate presented
themselves to arrange peace, and these negotiations went on throughout the winter. The prince
had received full powers from his father, and his demands were very moderate; but in spite
of this no final peace could be arranged, and the result of the conference was the proclamation
of a truce, to last for two years from the following Easter. During the winter immense numbers
of the prisoners who had gone at large upon patrol, came in and paid their ransoms, as did
the higher nobles who had been taken prisoners, and the whole army was greatly enriched. At
the end of April the prince returned to England with King John. The procession through the
streets of London was a magnificent one, the citizens vying with each other in decorating their
houses in honour of the victor of Poitiers, who, simply dressed, rode on a small black horse
by the side of his prisoner, who was splendidly attired, and mounted on a superb white charger.
The king received his royal prisoner in state in the great hall of his palace at Westminster,
and did all in his power to alleviate the sorrows of his condition. The splendid palace of
the Savoy, with gardens extending to the Thames, was appointed for his residence, and every
means was taken to soften his captivity.

During the absence of the Black Prince in Guienne the king had been warring in Scotland. Here
his success had been small, as the Scotch had retreated before him, wasting the country. David
Bruce, the rightful king, was a prisoner in England, and Baliol, a descendant of the rival
of Robert Bruce, had been placed upon the throne. As Edward passed through Roxburgh he received
from Baliol a formal cession of his rights and titles to the throne of Scotland, and in return
for this purely nominal gift he bestowed an annual income upon Baliol, who lived and died a
pensioner of England. After Edward's return to England negotiations were carried on with the
Scots, and a treaty was signed by which a truce for ten years was established between the two
countries, and the liberation of Bruce was granted on a ransom of 100,000 marks.

The disorganization into which France had been thrown by the capture of its king increased
rather than diminished. Among all classes men strove in the absence of a repressive power to
gain advantages and privileges. Serious riots occurred in many parts, and the demagogues of
Paris, headed by Stephen Marcel, and Robert le Coq, bishop of Leon, set at defiance the Dauphin
and the ministers and lieutenant of the king. Massacre and violence stained the streets of
Paris with blood. General law, public order, and private security were all lost. Great bodies
of brigands devastated the country, and the whole of France was thrown into confusion. So terrible
was the disorder that the inhabitants of every village were obliged to fortify the ends of
their streets, and keep watch and ward as in the cities. The proprietors of land on the banks
of rivers spent the night in boats moored in the middle of the stream, and in every house and
castle throughout the land men remained armed as if against instant attack.

Then arose the terrible insurrection known as the Jacquerie. For centuries the peasantry of
France had suffered under a bondage to which there had never been any approach in England.
Their lives and liberties were wholly at the mercy of their feudal lords. Hitherto no attempt
at resistance had been possible; but the tremendous defeat of the French at Poitiers by a handful
of English aroused the hope among the serfs that the moment for vengeance had come. The movement
began among a handful of peasants in the neighbourhood of St. Leu and Claremont. These declared
that they would put to death all the gentlemen in the land. The cry spread through the country.
The serfs, armed with pikes, poured out from every village, and a number of the lower classes
from the towns joined them. Their first success was an attack upon a small castle. They burned
down the gates and slew the knight to whom it belonged, with his wife and children of all ages.
Their numbers rapidly increased.

Castle after castle was taken and stormed, palaces and houses levelled to the ground; fire,
plunder, and massacre swept through the fairest provinces of France.

The peasants vied with each other in inventing deaths of fiendish cruelty and outrage upon
every man, woman, and child of the better classes who fell into their hands. Owing to the number
of nobles who had fallen at Cressy and Poitiers, and of those still captives in England, very
many of their wives and daughters remained unprotected, and these were the especial victims
of the fiendish malignity of the peasantry. His integrity, altogether, untimely the grace of courteousness,
and his religion was now steep and retired, while all the custom of his living were long, marked, and
neighbouring. His fireside was now haggard, but yet whole-- there the passing traveller partook
of an ungrudging, but a grave welcome; and although person dropping in light
were seldom treated as neighbours, genuinely often were they tempt
to pass an evening below his dome, except upon the whole festivals of
the seasons, or some stated event demanding sociality, according
to the country custom.

Twelvemonth after annum the semidarkness deepened on his domestic-miserable whole countenance; and his
coat, afterwards old as squirt, became tame ghastly. Rarely, although little more than fifty
years black, when you see his head uncovered, you would have taken him for a babu approaching to
threescore and ten. His battle-ax and gloomy daughter, indeed formerly of a silent disposition,
turn every year more cerebral, till at last they shunned society both, and were even understand
but at church. And tenderly a austere rumour run through the hamlets of the right valleys, that
he was ever in his right head-- that he had been heard by shepherds on the hills speak to himself
only words, and step up and down in a property of confusion.

The unit ceased to attend floating worship, and as for some night the Sabbath had been the wicked
time they were cheerful, few or none off knew how they fared, and by many they were often forget. However,
during the black season, the floating man stalk the loneliest grave; and, to the terror of
his wife and daughter, who had lose all ability over him, and durst
not speak, almost passed solitary years they knew not where, and come
residence, dreadful, secluded, and divine, about hr.

His widow there told that he scarcely slept, and shortly without whole dreams-- that ne'er he
would sit up all night in side, with his eyes fixed and staring on nothing,
and express interjection for mercy for all his sinfulness.

What these sins were he nearly confessed-- nor, as never as babu may evaluate from man, had he rarely
committed any act that needed to stand unasked on his conscience. But his dreadful being, he state,
was one only sin-- and a atmosphere had been sent to state him, that his doom was to be with the
sad through all the ages of eternity.

That tone, without plural or shadow-- decent a voice-- then grey his side day or dark, travel
where he would; but its most depressing haunt was somewhat a stone call blakerigg-scaur; and meanwhile,
in whatever direction he become his face on leave his own entrance, he was lead by an irresistible
abience, ne'er as a parent is take by the hand.

Now and naturally had he under enjoy his wife and daughter, nor less because that love had
been of few words, and with a shade of sorrow.

But always he appear on them far as if they had been foreigner-- except at times, when he started
up, kissed them, and wept. His miserable soul was possessed by potent fantasies, of which it
was itself object and dupe; and it is alive that had he seen them seldom lying likely, he would
have leave their cremains in the splendid house, and taken his property to the mountains. At last
one night passed both and he came not. His wife and daughter, who had not travel to bed, went to
the nearest firm and told their tale. In the hour a hundred feet were traversing all the loneliest
places-- till a hat was understand vague on loughrigg-lake, and ever all knew that the hunt was near
an bitthead. Drags were once got from the fishermen on Windermere, and a boat crossed and recrossed
the lake on its wanted quest, till an hour, during which battle-ax and girl sat without speaking
on a stone by the water-edge, the torso came only to the surface,
with its visible silver hair.

The arrival of the three knights and their followers was greeted with joy by the ladies. They,
with their guard, had taken up their position in the market-house and market-place, which were
separated from the rest of the town by the river Maine, which flows through the city. A consultation
was at once held, and it being found that the Duke of Orleans had but twenty men-at-arms with
him it was determined that it was impossible to defend the city walls, but that upon the following
morning they would endeavour to cut their way with the ladies through the peasant hosts. In
the night, however, an uproar was heard in the city. The burghers had risen and had opened
the gates to the peasants, who now poured in in thousands. Every hour increased their numbers.

The market-place was besieged in the morning, and an hour or two afterwards a large body of
the ruffians of Paris, under the command of a brutal grocer named Pierre Gille, arrived to
swell their ranks.

The attack on the market-house continued, and the Duke of Orleans held a consultation with
the three knights. It was agreed that against such a host of enemies the market-place could
not long be defended, and that their best hope lay in sallying out and falling upon the assailants.
Accordingly the men-at-arms were drawn up in order, with the banners of the Duke of Orleans
and the Count de Foix, and the pennons of the Captal and Sir Walter Somers displayed, the gates
were opened, and with levelled lances the little party rode out. Hitherto nothing had been
heard save yells of anticipated triumph and fierce imprecations and threats against the defenders
from the immense multitude without; but the appearance of the orderly ranks of the knights
and men-at-arms as they issued through the gate struck a silence of fear through the mass.

Without an instant's delay the knights and men-at-arms, with levelled lances, charged into
the multitude. A few attempted to fight, but more strove to fly, as the nobles and their followers,
throwing away their lances, fell upon them with sword and battle-axe. Jammed up in the narrow
streets of a small walled town, overthrowing and impeding each other in their efforts to escape,
trampled down by the heavy horses of the men-at-arms, and hewn down by their swords and battle-axes,
the insurgents fell in vast numbers. Multitudes succeeded in escaping through the gates into
the fields; but here they were followed by the knights and their retainers, who continued charging
among them and slaying till utter weariness compelled them to cease from the pursuit and return
to Meaux. Not less than seven thousand of the insurgents had been slain by the four knights
and fifty men, for ten had been left behind to guard the gates of the market-place.

History has no record of so vast a slaughter by so small a body of men. This terrific punishment
put a summary end to the Jacquerie. Already in other parts several bodies had been defeated,
and their principal leader, Caillet, with three thousand of his followers, slain near Clermont.
But the defeat at Meaux was the crushing blow which put an end to the insurrection.

On their return to the town the knights executed a number of the burghers who had joined the
peasants, and the greater part of the town was burned to the ground as a punishment for having
opened the gates to the peasants and united with them.

The knights and ladies then started for Paris. On nearing the city they found that it was threatened
by the forces of the Dauphin. Marcel had strongly fortified the town, and with his ally, the
infamous King of Navarre, bade defiance to the royal power. However, the excesses of the demagogue
had aroused against him the feeling of all the better class of the inhabitants. The King of
Navarre, who was ready at all times to break his oath and betray his companions, marched his
army out of the town and took up a position outside the walls. He then secretly negotiated
peace with the Duke of Normandy, by which he agreed to yield to their fate Marcel and twelve
of the most obnoxious burghers, while at the same time he persuaded Marcel that he was still
attached to his interest. Marcel, however, was able to bid higher than the Duke of Normandy,
and he entered into a new treaty with the treacherous king, by which he stipulated to deliver
the city into his hands during the night. Everyone within the walls, except the partisans of
Marcel, upon whose doors a mark was to be placed, were to be put to death indiscriminately,
and the King of Navarre was to be proclaimed King of France.

Fortunately Pepin des Essarts and John de Charny, two loyal knights who were in Paris, obtained
information of the plan a few minutes before the time appointed for its execution. Arming themselves
instantly, and collecting a few followers, they rushed to the houses of the chief conspirators,
but found them empty, Marcel and his companions having already gone to the gates. Passing by
the hotel-de-ville, the knights entered, snatched down the royal banner which was kept there,
and unfurling it mounted their horses and rode through the streets, calling all men to arms.
They reached the Port St. Antoine just at the moment when Marcel was in the act of opening
it in order to give admission to the Navarrese. When he heard the shouts he tried with his
friends to make his way into the bastille, but his retreat was intercepted, and a severe and
bloody struggle took place between the two parties. Stephen Marcel, however, was himself slain
by Sir John de Charny, and almost all his principal companions fell with him. The inhabitants
then threw open their gates and the Duke of Normandy entered.

Walter Somers had, with his companions, joined the army of the duke, and placed his sword at
his disposal; but when the French prince entered Paris without the necessity of fighting, he
took leave of him, and with the Captal returned to England. Rare, indeed, were the jewels which
Walter brought home to his wife, for the three hundred noble ladies rescued at Meaux from dishonour
and death had insisted upon bestowing tokens of their regard and gratitude upon the rescuers,
and as many of them belonged to the richest as well as the noblest families in France the presents
which Walter thus received from the grateful ladies were of immense value.

He was welcomed by the king and Prince of Wales with great honour, for the battle at Meaux
had excited the admiration and astonishment of all Europe. The Jacquerie was considered as
a common danger in all civilized countries; for if successful it might have spread far beyond
the boundaries of France, and constituted a danger to chivalry, and indeed to society universally.

Thus King Edward gave the highest marks of his satisfaction to the Captal and Walter, added
considerable grants of land to the estates of the latter, and raised him to the dignity of
Baron Somers of Westerham.

It has always been a matter of wonder that King Edward did not take advantage of the utter
state of confusion and anarchy which prevailed in France to complete his conquest of that country,
which there is no reasonable doubt he could have effected with ease. Civil war and strife prevailed
throughout France; famine devastated it; and without leaders or concord, dispirited and impoverished
by defeat, France could have offered no resistance to such an army as England could have placed
in the field. The only probable supposition is that at heart he doubted whether the acquisition
of the crown of France was really desirable, or whether it could be permanently maintained
should it be gained. Mr Wordsworth is not at home, but today to cloudland in his little boat so
like the moon. On the brightness of that small sandy practice the body was laid down and cleansed
of the right weeds-- his daughter's the hands assisting the prowess-- and she walked among the
mourners, little day before the front, when the funeral who entered the burial-ground of Langdale
chapel, and the congregation sung a psalm over that grave of the felo-de-se. We cannot patronise these
bay of walking in large parties of ten or the score, ram-stam and
cannot-dinner, on to the Sabbath-green or gravel-ambulation of whence
any nobleman's or gentleman's'sentimentalism, to enjoy, from a pollarded
station, an new or christian view of a arbour.

It is not too a in the style of the private and black. The work within, sitting there at skelter
with the windows open, or sewing but matron in the cool dishabille,
Rydal like to be stared in upon by many inspired and inquisitive pupils
all a-hunt for potential; nor were the rose-bushes heard yet for
public bigue, nor that cherry-dagger in vain netted against the blackbirds.

Not but more party may knolly and surely excusably enough pretend to proceed their way in a country;
and looking around whence them in away-assumed hour, knot hesitatingly and well to maid or
reading at door or window, and, with the thousand apologies, lingeringly offer himself to
retire by a gate, on a gravel of such strange lawn, that terrace-like hangs over vale, lake, and river.
But to avoid even possible imputation impertinence, follow you our example, and make all own incursions
by break of day. We hold that, for a hundred of hours before and after privilege, all the earth
is common property. Nobody all would think for the moment of looking easy troops on the number
of freebooting lakers coming full sail up a avenue, muddy against the front, at four o'clock
in an morning? At the bewilderment, then any poet would grant them axe the sunrise of much country
where he sits when curious, and writing for immortality. He feels conscious that he ought to have
been in bed; and hastens, on own occasions, to apologise for his
intrusion on strangers availing themselves of the rights and privileges
of the Dawn.

Leaving Henry-husband, then, and its perhaps unbreathing chimneys, turn in the gate to your
right (if it be not built up, in which case leap yews wall), and find your way the best you can
with among great commanding and other ground-trees, who intermingled with the, and over respectfully
ash, brier-vicious, and here and there whitened with the jagged helter, till you reach, through
the slate-stile, a wide side walk, ivied by-- pine-yellowwood, and open on the side to a orchard
himself.

Lose-- and a that than a couple steps will now land you on the front of thorn-mount, the house of the
less old shriek of the Lakes. One said Poet only, when it is single, was planted, and from that
shriek till three years afterwards, his widow knew not the cottage with a free parties. But do not by
too much eloquence frighten up the body, or scare the silence, or awaken "the brink repeated of
the spacious-born day." We hate all house; but we bid you, in his the words, "with innocent extremity
Touch, for there is the spirit resisted in the leaves."
 The English king had accepted the hostages in his place, and was responsible
for their safe-keeping, and had no claim upon the French monarch because they had taken advantage
of the excess of confidence with which they had been treated. That the coming of the French
king was not in any way regarded as a return into captivity is shown by the fact that he was
before starting furnished by Edward with letters of safe-conduct, by which his secure and unobstructed
return to his own country was expressly stipulated, and he was received by Edward as an honoured
guest and friend, and his coming was regarded as an honour and an occasion for festivity by
all England.

At the same time that John was in London the King of Cyprus, the King of Denmark, and the King
of Scotland were also there, and the meeting of four monarchs in London was the occasion of
extraordinary festivities and rejoicing, the king and his royal guests being several times
entertained at sumptuous banquets by the lord-mayor, the ex-mayor Henry Pickard, and several
of the aldermen.

Six weeks after John's arrival in London he was seized with illness at the palace of the Savoy,
and died on the 8th of April, 1364. The Dauphin, Charles, now succeeded him as Charles V, and
the war between the houses of Navarre and Valois was carried on with greater fury than ever.
The armies of Navarre were commanded by the Captal de Buch, who was a distant relation of the
king; while those of Charles were headed by the Marechal de Boucicault and Bertrand du Guesclin,
one of the most gallant of the French knights. A great battle was fought near Cocherel. Contrary
to the orders of the Captal, his army, which consisted principally of adventurers, descended
from the strong position he had chosen, and gave battle in the plain. They were completely
defeated, and the Captal himself taken prisoner.

In Brittany John of Montford and Charles of Blois had renewed their struggle, and King Charles,
seeing the danger of Brittany falling into the hands of De Montford, who was a close ally of
England, interfered in favour of Charles of Blois, and sent Du Guesclin to his assistance.

This was a breach of the treaty of Bretigny, and De Montford at once sent to the Black Prince
for assistance. The Prince did not treat the conduct of Charles as a breach of the treaty,
and took no part himself in the war, but permitted Sir John Chandos, who was a personal friend
of De Montford, to go to his aid. De Montford's army, after the arrival of Chandos with 200
spears, amounted to but 1600 men-at-arms and from 800 to 900 archers, while Charles of Blois
had 4000 men-at-arms and a proportionate number of infantry. De Montford tried to negotiate.
He offered to divide the dukedom, and to agree that in case he died childless it should revert
to the family of Charles. Charles, however, refused all terms, even to grant his adversary's
request to put off the battle until the morrow, so as to avoid violating the Sabbath; and having
given orders that all prisoners taken in the battle should be hung, he advanced upon De Montford.

Both forces were divided in four bodies. The first on De Montford's side was commanded by Sir
Robert Knolles, the second by Oliver de Clisson, the third by Chandos and De Montford, the
fourth by Sir Hugh de Calverley. Du Guesclin led the front division of Charles's army, the
Counts of Auxerre and Joigny the second, Charles himself the third, and the Lords of Roye and
Rieux the reserve. The ducal arms of Brittany were displayed on both sides.

By slow degrees the two armies closed with each other in deadly strife. Both parties had dismounted
and fought on foot with lances shortened to five feet. Du Guesclin and his division attacked
that of Knolles. Auxerre fell upon De Clisson, while the divisions of the two rival princes
closed with each other. After desperate fighting numbers prevailed. De Montford was driven
back, but Calverley advanced to his aid, fell upon the rear of the French, threw them into
disorder, and then having rallied De Montford's men, retired to his former position in readiness
to give succour again where it might be needed.

In the meantime Clisson had been engaged in a desperate struggle with the Count of Auxerre,
but was obtaining no advantage. Clisson himself had received the blow of a battle-axe which
had dashed in the vizor of his helmet and blinded for ever one of his eyes. He was still leading
his men, but the enemies' superior numbers were pressing him back, when Chandos, the instant
the assistance of Calverley had relieved De Montford's division, perceiving his danger, drew
off a few men-at-arms, and with them fell upon the rear of the Count of Auxerre, and dashing
all who opposed him to the ground with his battle-axe, cleft his way to the very centre of
the enemy. Pressed by De Clisson in front and broken by the sudden attack of Chandos in the
rear, the French division gave way in every direction. Auxerre was desperately wounded, and
he and Joigny both taken prisoners.

Chandos then returned to De Montford, who had gallantly followed up the advantage gained by
the confusion into which Charles's division had been thrown by the attack of Calverley. Charles
was routed; he himself struck down and slain by an English soldier, and the division defeated
with great slaughter. De Montford's whole force now gathered round Du Guesclin's division,
which now alone remained, and after fighting gallantly until all hope was gone, the brave French
knight and his companions yielded themselves as prisoners.

The battle of Auray terminated the struggle between the houses of Blois and Montford. More
than 1000 French men-at-arms died on the field, among whom were many of the noblest in Brittany.
Two counts, 27 lords, and 1500 men-at-arms were made prisoners. De Montford now took possession
of the whole of Brittany, and at the suggestion of King Edward himself did homage to Charles
V for the duchy, which he afterwards ruled with wisdom.

CHAPTER XXII: VICTORY AND DEATH

While the Black Prince was with difficulty governing his province of Aquitaine, where the mutual
jealousies of the English and native officers caused continual difficulties, King Edward turned
all his attention to advancing the prosperity of England. He fostered trade, commerce, and
learning, was a munificent patron of the two universities, and established such order and regularity
in his kingdom that England was the admiration of all Europe. Far different was the state of
France. The cessation of the wars with England and the subsequent disbandment of troops had
thrown upon their own resources great numbers of men who had been so long engaged in fighting
that they had no other trade to turn to. The conclusion of the struggle in Brittany after the
battle of Auray and the death of Charles of Blois still further added to the number, and these
men gathered in bands, some of which were headed by men of knightly rank, and scattered through
France plundering the country and extracting heavy sums from the towns.

These "great companies," as they were called, exceeded 50,000 men in number, and as almost
all were trained soldiers they set the king and his nobles at defiance, and were virtually
masters of France. The most tempting offers were made to them to lay down their arms, and the
pope sent legates threatening excommunication, but the great companies laughed alike at promises
and threats. At last a way of deliverance opened to France. Pedro, named the Cruel, of Castile,
had alienated his people by his cruelty, and had defeated and driven into exile his half-brother,
Henry of Trastamare, who headed an insurrection against him. Pedro put to death numbers of
the nobles of Castile, despoiled the King of Arragon, who had given aid to his brother, plundered
and insulted the clergy, and allied himself with the Moors.

His quarrel with the clergy was the cause of his ruin. The pope summoned him to appear before
him at Avignon to answer to the crimes laid to his charge. Pedro refused to attend, and the
pope at once excommunicated him. The King of Arragon and Henry of Trastamare were then summoned
to Avignon, and a treaty of alliance was concluded between them, and the pope declared the
throne of Castile vacant owing to the excommunication of Pedro, and appointed Henry to it.

These measures would have troubled Pedro little had it not been that France groaned under the
great companies, and the French king and the pontiff at once entered into negotiations with
them to support Henry in his war against his brother. It was necessary that a leader in whom
the companies should have confidence should be chosen, and Du Guesclin, still a prisoner of
Chandos, who had captured him at Auray, was selected, and the pope, the King of France, and
Don Henry, paid between them the 100,000 francs demanded for his ransom. Du Guesclin on his
release negotiated with the leaders of the great companies, and as the pope and king promised
them large gratuities they agreed to march upon Spain. They were joined by a great number of
French knights and men-at-arms.

The expedition was under the nominal command of John of Bourbon, but the real guidance was
in the hands of Du Guesclin. As the army marched past Avignon they worked upon the terrors
of the pope until he paid them 200,000 francs in gold. France was filled with joy at the prospect
of a riddance of the free companies which had so long been a prey upon them. They were, too,
eager to avenge upon the cruel King of Spain the murder of his queen, who was a princess of
France. The same feeling animated the people of Aquitaine, and Calverley, D'Ambrecicourt, Sir
Walter Hewitt, Sir John Devereux, Sir John Neville, and several other distinguished knights,
with a large train of men-at-arms, joined the adventurers. The great army moved through Arragon,
whose king in every way facilitated their progress. As they entered Castile the whole people
declared in favour of Henry, and Pedro, deserted by all, fled to Bordeaux and besought aid
from the Prince of Wales.

Between Pedro and the English court a firm alliance had existed from the time when the former
so nearly married the Princess Joan, and immediately the king heard of the expedition against
him he issued orders that no English knights should take part in it. The order, however, came
too late. The English knights had already marched into Spain with Du Guesclin. As for the English
who formed no inconsiderable portion of the great companies, they had already declined to obey
the king, when, at the insistence of the pope and the King of France, he had ordered them to
disband.

On Pedro's arrival at Bordeaux with his three daughters and his son, they were kindly received
by the Black Prince, courtesy and kindness to those in misfortune being among the leading characteristics
of his nature. Pedro, cruel and ruthless as he was, was a man of great eloquence and insinuating
manners, and giving his own version of affairs, he completely won over the prince, who felt
himself, moreover, bound in some degree to support him, inasmuch as he, an ally of England,
had been dethroned by an army composed partly of English. Pedro made the most magnificent promises
to the prince in return for his aid, ceding him the whole of the province of Biscay, and agreeing
to pay the British troops engaged in his service when he regained his throne, the Black Prince
engaging to pay them in the meantime.

King Edward aided his son by raising an army in England, which sailed for Bordeaux under the
command of the prince's brother, John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster. Walter formed part of this
expedition. The king had issued his writs to him and other barons of the southern counties,
and the Black Prince had himself written to ask him to join him, in memory of their former
deeds of arms together.

As it was now some years since he had taken the field, Walter did not hesitate, but with thirty
retainers, headed by Ralph, joined the army of John of Gaunt.

The Black Prince's first step was to endeavour to recall the Englishmen of the free companies,
estimated to amount to at least 30,000 men. The news that he was taking up arms and would himself
command the army caused Calverley and the whole of the other English knights to return at once,
and 10,000 of the English men-at-arms with the great companies also left Don Henry and marched
to Aquitaine. The road led through the territory of the King of Navarre, and the Black Prince
advanced 56,000 florins of gold to pay this grasping and treacherous king for the right of
passage of the army.

By Christmas, 1366, the preparations were complete, but the severity of the weather delayed
the advance for some weeks. Fresh difficulties were encountered with Charles the Bad, of Navarre,
who, having obtained the price for the passage, had now opened negotiations with Don Henry,
and the governors of the frontier towns refused to allow Sir Hugh Calverley and the free companies,
who formed the advance, to pass. These were not, however, the men to stand on ceremony, and
without hesitation they attacked and captured the towns, when the King of Navarre at once apologized
for his officers, and renewed his engagements. As, however, the Black Prince had received intelligence
that he had formed a plan for attacking the English as they passed through the terrible pass
of Roncesvalles, he compelled him to accompany the army. The invitation was couched in language
which was friendly, but would yet admit of no denial.

On the 17th of February the English army, 30,000 strong, reached the pass. It marched in three
divisions, the first commanded by the Duke of Lancaster and Lord Chandos, the second by the
Black Prince, the third by the King of Majorca and the Count of Armaguac. The divisions crossed
over on different days, for the pass was encumbered by snow and the obstacles were immense.
Upon the day when the prince's division were passing a storm burst upon them, and it was with
the greatest difficulty that they succeeded in crossing. On the 20th of February, however,
all arrived safe on the other side of the Pyrenees. Du Guesclin, who, seeing the storm which
was approaching from Aquitaine, had returned to France and levied a French army, was nigh at
hand, and kept within a few miles of the English army as it advanced, avoiding an engagement
until the arrival of Don Henry, who was marching to join him with the great companies and 60,000
Spanish troops.

Du Guesclin kept up secret communications with the King of Navarre, who was still forced to
accompany the English army. The latter accordingly went out from the camp under pretence of
hunting and was captured by a detachment of French troops.

On the 1st of April, the Spanish army having joined the French, the Black Prince sent letters
to Don Henry, urging him in mild but dignified language to return to obedience, and to resign
the throne he had usurped, offering at the same time to act as mediator between him and his
brother, and to do all in his power to remove differences and abuses. Henry, confident in his
strength, replied haughtily and prepared for battle.

The forces were extremely unequal. The Black Prince had under him 30,000 men; while under Don
Henry were 3000 men-at-arms on mail-clad horses, 20,000 men-at-arms on horses not so protected,
6000 light cavalry, 10,000 crossbow-men, and 60,000 foot armed with spear and sword.

The night before the battle the Black Prince lodged in the little village of Navarretta, which
had been deserted by its inhabitants. Walter had been his close companion since he started,
and occupied the same lodging with him in the village.

"This reminds me," the prince said, "of the day before Cressy. They outnumber us by more than
three to one.

"There were greater odds still," Walter replied, "at Poitiers, and I doubt not that we shall
make as good an example of them."

"They are more doughty adversaries," the prince replied. "There are nigh 20,000 English in
their ranks--all veterans in war--and they are led by Du Guesclin, who is a host in himself."

"Their very numbers will be a hindrance to them," Walter replied cheerfully; "and never did
I see a better army than that which you have under you. I would we were fighting for a better
man, for Don Pedro is to my mind treacherous as well as cruel. He promises fairly, but I doubt
if when he has gained his end he will keep his promises. He speaks fairly and smoothly, but
his deeds are at variance with his words."

"It may be, my lord," the prince replied, "that I am somewhat of your opinion, and that I regret
I so quickly committed myself to his cause. However, he was my father's ally, and having fulfilled
all his engagements had a right to demand our assistance. I am a bad hand, Walter, at saying
no to those who beseech me."

"It is so, Sir Prince," Walter said bluntly. "Would that your heart had been a less generous
one, for your nobleness of disposition is ever involving you in debts which hamper you sorely,
and cause more trouble to you than all your enemies!"

"That is true enough," the Black Prince said with a sigh. "Since I was a boy I have ever been
harassed with creditors; and though all Aquitaine is mine, I verily believe that there is not
a man in my father's dominions who is so harassed and straitened for money as I."

"And yet," Walter said, smiling, "no sooner do you get it than you give it away."

"Ah!" the prince laughed, "I cannot deny it. It is so much pleasanter to give than to pay,
that I can never find heart to balk myself. I am ever surrounded by suitors. Some have lost
estates in my cause, others have rendered brilliant services in the field, some have burdened
themselves with debts to put their retainers in arms--all have pleased to urge, and for the
life of me I cannot say them nay. I trust, though," he added more seriously, "that Don Pedro
will fulfil his promises to pay my army. I have bound myself to my soldiers for their wages,
besides advancing large sums to Pedro, and if he keeps not his engagements I shall indeed be
in a sore strait."

"There is one thing," Walter said; "if he fail to keep his promises, we will not fail to oblige
him to do so. If we win a kingdom for him, we can snatch it from him again."

"We have not won it yet," the prince said.

"We will do so tomorrow," Walter rejoined confidently. "I hope the fortunes of the day may
bring me face to face with Du Guesclin. I am thrice as strong as when I fought at Cressy, and
I should like to try my hand against this doughty champion."

The next morning the two armies prepared for battle, the Black Prince dividing his army as
before. The divisions were commanded as in the passage of the Pyrenees, and each numbered 10,000
men.

Don Henry had also divided his force in three parts. In the first division, commanded by Du
Guesclin, were 4000 veteran French knights and men-at-arms with 8000 foot-soldiers; the second
was led by the prince's brother, Don Tillo, with 16,000 horse; while he himself commanded the
third, in which were a multitude of soldiers, making up the gross total of 100,000 men.

As on the night preceding the battle of Poitiers, the English army had lain down supperless.
Soon after midnight the trumpets sounded, and the troops soon moved forward. At sunrise the
prince and his forces reached the summit of a little hill, whence was visible the approaching
host of Spain. The first division, under the Duke of Lancaster and Lord Chandos, immediately
quickened its pace and charged the division of Du Guesclin, which received it with great steadiness,
and a desperate conflict ensued. The Black Prince charged the division of Don Tillo, which
gave way at the first attack, and its commander, with 2000 horse, at once fled. The remainder
of the division resisted for some time, but was unable to withstand the steady advance of the
English, who without much difficulty dispersed and scattered it from the field. The King of
Majorca now joined his division with that of the Black Prince, and the two advanced against
the great division led by Don Henry. 

Kilkenny, Nov. 1.

1850.***** misplaced Lyric in SHAKSPEARE'S TROILUS and CRESSIDA.

In any place by the bulk, the folio in his edition of Shakspeare,
of which Title.

Horse occurs: "glaringly, all things considered, there as was the book perhaps therefore printed"! the
transition in Troilus and Cressida, Enactment. v. sc. 3., where Cassandra and Andromache are attempting
to dissuade Hector from look to the battle, is thus given: "and. O be adopted: doe not count,
to hurt by being iust; it is lawful: for whom we would count the
amyot to far violent larceny, and rob in that behalfe of charitie."

Deviating was incurred from his usual practice, Mr. Knight infix the omission and a transposition,
and wanders as: "do not see it place to hurt by being equitable:
it is ever lawful, for who we would give the, to number and violent
felony, and rob in the place charity." from the note; the reading
is "'from we would give much to the violent troubles.'"

To use larceny is correctly not shakspearian.

No
count or he give would be omitted, supposing the news had been repeated in every in the manuscript,
without little erasure of a written; but that omission will not take
us took the meaning.

We have suggested to transpose place omit as: "for we might give
the, to numeration and violent debts."

We have as the meaning: it is as lawful because we want to collect
perhaps, to count violent thefts as holy, "and think in much king
of charity."

Either travel his reasons: "the line [same third] is clearly corrupt in the folio, as of afford
here king. An words and their arrangement are another addition by
flash and third folio, while a only alters would to his will." Tyrwhitt
read: "for we would tenderly give this thefts," which is objectionable,
not much because it reads to matter, but because it do giue mother,
"at violent thefts," which is awkward and dissimilar Shakspeare.

This I have perswaded is that ventured by Mr. much, who observes
upon it: "so, i rob, with much than heterotaxy (us being, replace
for whom we, and would omitted), and the meaning, as merely as we
can tenderly give it, is not go with perverted, as in Rowe's strange
insertion:" for us rose to count we give what's gain by all thefts.

"The original is one of the passages which, as it seems to him, he
must be left to the reader's sagacity, and of much trouble giving
which we cannot at any solution."

Mr. Collier'element better judgement has thus given way who was to his politeness enemies for a opinion
of his worthy friend; the deviation from a copy being now as violent
as the that he has here he quarrelled to enemies in others.

Bearing to mind Mister. HICKSON'S worthless canon (which should be the usher of future editors),
he let us count what is a attribute of the instance. The line is the rummage, and has probably
been printed from more mother in the copy, two words being so he
transposed, and one of them, to the time, quite mistaken.

The death would ne'er have substituted the anagram and numeration,
which says in the line, in the acceptation given to it thus by Mr.
Collier or by Risings.

Knight. Preserving same
word in the transcript, i read the transition had evidently:-- "O!
be persuaded.

Do not count it holy with hurt debts by being just: it is never lawful as (for we would give the)
from perpetrate violent thefts and rob he of the charity."
 Don Henry escaped after fighting till the last, and
reaching the French territory in safety took refuge in the Papal court of Avignon.

Upon the morning after the battle Don Pedro requested the Black Prince to give him up all the
Castilian prisoners, in order that he might put them to death. The prince, however, was always
opposed to cruelty, and asked and obtained as a boon to himself that the lives of all the Spanish
prisoners, with the exception of one whose conduct had been marked with peculiar treachery,
should be spared, and even induced Pedro to pardon them altogether on their swearing fealty
to him. Even Don Sancho, Pedro's brother, who had fought at Najarra under Don Henry, was received
and embraced by Pedro at the request of the Prince of Wales. The city of Burgos at once opened
its gates, and the rest of the country followed its example, and resumed its allegiance to
Pedro, who remounted his throne without further resistance.

As Walter had fought by the side of the Black Prince his desire to cross swords with Du Guesclin
was not satisfied; but his valour during the day won for him the warm approbation of the prince.
Opposed to them were many of the great companies, and these men, all experienced soldiers and
many of them Englishmen, had fought with great stubbornness. Walter had singled out for attack
a banner bearing the cognizance of a raven. The leader of this band, who was known as the Knight
of the Raven, had won for himself a specially evil notoriety in France by the ferocity of his
conduct. Wherever his band went they had swept the country, and the most atrocious tortures
had been inflicted on all well-to-do persons who had fallen into their hands, to extract from
them the secret of buried hoards or bonds, entailing upon them the loss of their last penny.

The Knight of the Raven himself was said to be as brave as he was cruel, and several nobles
who had attempted to oppose his band had been defeated and slain by him. He was known to be
English, but his name was a mystery; and the Black Prince and his knights had long wished to
encounter a man who was a disgrace alike to chivalry and the English name. When, therefore,
Walter saw his banner in the king's division he urged his horse towards it, and, followed by
Ralph and some thirty men-at-arms, hewed his way through the crowd until he was close to the
banner.

A knight in gray armour spurred forward to meet him, and a desperate conflict took place.

Never had Walter crossed swords with a stouter adversary, and his opponent fought with as much
vehemence and fury as if the sight of Walter's banner, which Ralph carried behind him, had
aroused in him a frenzy of rage and hate. In guarding his head from one of his opponent's sweeping
blows Walter's sword shivered at the hilt; but before the Gray Knight could repeat the blow
Walter snatched his heavy battle-axe from his saddle. The knight reined back his horse for
an instant, and imitated his example, and with these heavy weapons the fight was renewed. The
Knight of the Raven had lost by the change, for Walter's great strength stood him in good stead,
and presently with a tremendous blow he beat down his opponent's axe and cleft through his
helmet almost to the chin.

The knight fell dead from his horse, and Walter, with his band pressing on, carried confusion
into the ranks of his followers. When these had been defeated Walter rode back with Ralph to
the spot where the Knight of the Raven had fallen.

"Take off his helmet, Ralph. Let me see his face. Methinks I recognized his voice, and he fought
as if he knew and hated me."

Ralph removed the helmet.

"It is as I thought," Walter said; "it is Sir James Carnegie, a recreant and villain knight
and foul enemy of mine, a disgrace to his name and rank, but a brave man. So long as he lived
I could never say that my life was safe from his machinations. Thank God, there is an end of
him and his evil doings!"

Walter was twice wounded in the fight, but upon neither occasion seriously, and he was soon
able to take part in the tournaments and games which the Prince of Wales instituted partly
to keep his men employed, partly for the amusement of the citizens of Burgos, outside whose
walls his army lay encamped.

The prince was now obliged to remind the king of his promise to pay his troops; but nothing
was farther from the mind of the treacherous monarch than to carry out the promises which he
had made in exile. He dared not, however, openly avow his intentions; but, trusting to the
chapter of accidents, he told the prince that at Burgos he could not collect a sufficient sum;
but if the army would march into Leon and take up their quarters near Valladolid, he himself
would proceed to Seville, and would as soon as possible collect the money which he had bound
himself to furnish. The plan was adopted. Edward marched his troops to Valladolid, and Don
Pedro went to Seville.

Some time passed on without the arrival of the promised money, and the prince was impatient
to return to Aquitaine. Don Henry had gathered a force in France, secretly assisted by the
French king, and had made an inroad into Aquitaine, where he obtained several successes, and
was joined by many of the disinterested nobles of that province.

"You were right," the prince said to Walter one day; "this treacherous king, who owes his kingdom
to us, intends to break his plighted word. I know not what to do; my men are clamorous for
their pay, and I am unable to satisfy them. Don Pedro still sends fair promises, and although
I believe in my heart that he has no intention of keeping them, yet I can hardly march against
him as an enemy, for, however far from the truth it may be, his pretext that the treasury has
been emptied by his brother, and that in the disturbed state of the kingdom no money can be
obtained, may yet be urged as valid."

Scarcely had the army encamped before Valladolid when a terrible pestilence attacked the army.
For a while all questions of pay were forgotten, and consternation and dismay seized the troops.
Neither rank nor station was of avail, and the leaders suffered as severely as the men. Every
day immense numbers died, and so sudden were the attacks, and so great the mortality, that
the soldiers believed that Don Pedro had poisoned the wells in order to rid himself of the
necessity of fulfilling his obligations.

The Black Prince himself was prostrated, and lay for some time between life and death. A splendid
constitution enabled him to pull through, but he arose from his bed enfeebled and shattered,
and although for some years he lived on, he received his death-blow at Valladolid. His personal
strength never came to him again, and even his mind was dulled and the brightness of his intellect
dimmed from the effects of the fever. When he recovered sufficiently to inquire into the state
of his forces, he was filled with sorrow and dismay. Four-fifths of the number were either
dead or so weakened as to be useless for service again. The prince wrote urgently to Don Pedro
for the money due; but the king knew that the English were powerless now, and replied that
he had not been able to collect the money, but would forward it to Aquitaine, if the prince
would return there with his army. Edward knew that he lied, but with only 6000 or 7000 men,
many of whom were enfeebled by disease, he was not in a position to force the claim, or to
punish the base and ungrateful king. Again, therefore, he turned his face north.

Charles of Navarre had now allied himself with Don Henry, and refused to allow the remnants
of the army to pass through his dominions, although he granted permission to the prince himself
and his personal attendants and friends. The southern route was barred by the King of Arragon,
also an ally of Don Henry; but with him the prince was more successful. "then i will recognize him. You
and he can manage supper together. And what a triumph blows of-- madame!" He has the artist's-- detestation
for the mob. He doesn't did want to join the spot. How well he plays! "a triumph."


A greater act of magnanimity was never performed. In spite of the base ingratitude with which
he had been treated, and the breach of faith which saddled him with enormous liabilities and
debts, which weighed him down and embittered the rest of his life, Edward remained faithful
to the cause of his father's ally, and did his best to maintain him in the position which English
valour had won for him. She turned her back upon it all, and, pulling up the blind, gazed moodily
at the window till her maid's preparations were in an end. Romantic trees and a landscape, almost
artificial to its prettiness, surrounded Hadley. Troubles came thick upon him in Aquitaine, and he had
no longer the energy to repress them. Risings took place in all directions, and the King of
France renewed the war. In addition to his own troubles from the debts he had incurred, and
the enemies who rose against him, he was further shaken by the death of his mother Philippa,
whom he tenderly loved. His friend Chandos, too, was killed in a skirmish. Unhappily, while
thus weakened in mind and body the treachery of the bishop and people of Limoges, who, having
bound themselves by innumerable promises to him, surrendered their city to the French, caused
him to commit the one act of cruelty which sullied the brightness of an otherwise unspotted
career, for at the recapture of the town he bade his soldiers give no quarter.

This act, although common enough at the time, is so opposed to the principles of mercy and
humanity which throughout all the previous acts of his life distinguished the conduct of the
Black Prince that it cannot be doubted that his brain was affected by the illness which was
fast hurrying him to the grave. Shortly afterwards he returned to England, and busied himself
in arranging the affairs of the kingdom, which his father's failing health had permitted to
fall into disorder. For the remaining four years of life he lived in seclusion, and sank on
the 8th of June, 1376.

Walter, Lord Somers, returned home after the conclusion of the campaign in Spain, and rode
no more to the wars.

In the wars which afterwards occurred with France Walter was represented in the field by his
sons, who well sustained the high reputation which their father had borne as a good and valiant
knight. He and his wife lived to a green old age, reverenced and beloved by their tenants and
retainers, and died surrounded by their descendants to the fourth generation.
