CHAPTER I: DISCUSSION AND BED

Up at the League, says a friend, there had been one night a brisk conversational discussion,
as to what would happen on the Morrow of the Revolution, finally shading off into a vigorous
statement by various friends of their views on the future of the fully-developed new society.

Says our friend: Considering the subject, the discussion was good-tempered; for those present
being used to public meetings and after- lecture debates, if they did not listen to each others'
opinions (which could scarcely be expected of them), at all events did not always attempt to
speak all together, as is the custom of people in ordinary polite society when conversing on
a subject which interests them.  For the rest, there were six persons present, and consequently
six sections of the party were represented, four of which had strong but divergent Anarchist
opinions.  One of the sections, says our friend, a man whom he knows very well indeed, sat
almost silent at the beginning of the discussion, but at last got drawn into it, and finished
by roaring out very loud, and damning all the rest for fools; after which befel a period of
noise, and then a lull, during which the aforesaid section, having said good-night very amicably,
took his way home by himself to a western suburb, using the means of travelling which civilisation
has forced upon us like a habit.  As he sat in that vapour-bath of hurried and discontented
humanity, a carriage of the underground railway, he, like others, stewed discontentedly, while
in self-reproachful mood he turned over the many excellent and conclusive arguments which,
though they lay at his fingers' ends, he had forgotten in the just past discussion.  But this
frame of mind he was so used to, that it didn't last him long, and after a brief discomfort,
caused by disgust with himself for having lost his temper (which he was also well used to),
he found himself musing on the subject- matter of discussion, but still discontentedly and
unhappily.  "If I could but see a day of it," he said to himself; "if I could but see it!"

As he formed the words, the train stopped at his station, five minutes' walk from his own house,
which stood on the banks of the Thames, a little way above an ugly suspension bridge.  He went
out of the station, still discontented and unhappy, muttering "If I could but see it! if I
could but see it!" but had not gone many steps towards the river before (says our friend who
tells the story) all that discontent and trouble seemed to slip off him.

It was a beautiful night of early winter, the air just sharp enough to be refreshing after
the hot room and the stinking railway carriage.  The wind, which had lately turned a point
or two north of west, had blown the sky clear of all cloud save a light fleck or two which
went swiftly down the heavens.  There was a young moon halfway up the sky, and as the home-
farer caught sight of it, tangled in the branches of a tall old elm, he could scarce bring
to his mind the shabby London suburb where he was, and he felt as if he were in a pleasant
country place--pleasanter, indeed, than the deep country was as he had known it.

He came right down to the river-side, and lingered a little, looking over the low wall to note
the moonlit river, near upon high water, go swirling and glittering up to Chiswick Eyot: as
for the ugly bridge below, he did not notice it or think of it, except when for a moment (says
our friend) it struck him that he missed the row of lights down stream.  Then he turned to
his house door and let himself in; and even as he shut the door to, disappeared all remembrance
of that brilliant logic and foresight which had so illuminated the recent discussion; and of
the discussion itself there remained no trace, save a vague hope, that was now become a pleasure,
for days of peace and rest, and cleanness and smiling goodwill.

In this mood he tumbled into bed, and fell asleep after his wont, in two minutes' time; but
(contrary to his wont) woke up again not long after in that curiously wide-awake condition
which sometimes surprises even good sleepers; a condition under which we feel all our wits
preternaturally sharpened, while all the miserable muddles we have ever got into, all the disgraces
and losses of our lives, will insist on thrusting themselves forward for the consideration
of those sharpened wits.

In this state he lay (says our friend) till he had almost begun to enjoy it: till the tale
of his stupidities amused him, and the entanglements before him, which he saw so clearly, began
to shape themselves into an amusing story for him.

He heard one o'clock strike, then two and then three; after which he fell asleep again.  Our
friend says that from that sleep he awoke once more, and afterwards went through such surprising
adventures that he thinks that they should be told to our comrades, and indeed the public in
general, and therefore proposes to tell them now.  But, says he, I think it would be better
if I told them in the first person, as if it were myself who had gone through them; which,
indeed, will be the easier and more natural to me, since I understand the feelings and desires
of the comrade of whom I am telling better than any one else in the world does.

CHAPTER II: A MORNING BATH

Well, I awoke, and found that I had kicked my bedclothes off; and no wonder, for it was hot
and the sun shining brightly.  I jumped up and washed and hurried on my clothes, but in a hazy
and half-awake condition, as if I had slept for a long, long while, and could not shake off
the weight of slumber.  In fact, I rather took it for granted that I was at home in my own
room than saw that it was so.

When I was dressed, I felt the place so hot that I made haste to get out of the room and out
of the house; and my first feeling was a delicious relief caused by the fresh air and pleasant
breeze; my second, as I began to gather my wits together, mere measureless wonder: for it was
winter when I went to bed the last night, and now, by witness of the river-side trees, it was
summer, a beautiful bright morning seemingly of early June. However, there was still the Thames
sparkling under the sun, and near high water, as last night I had seen it gleaming under the moon.

I had by no means shaken off the feeling of oppression, and wherever I might have been should
scarce have been quite conscious of the place; so it was no wonder that I felt rather puzzled
in despite of the familiar face of the Thames.  Withal I felt dizzy and queer; and remembering
that people often got a boat and had a swim in mid-stream, I thought I would do no less.  It
seems very early, quoth I to myself, but I daresay I shall find someone at Biffin's to take
me.  However, I didn't get as far as Biffin's, or even turn to my left thitherward, because
just then I began to see that there was a landing-stage right before me in front of my house:
in fact, on the place where my next-door neighbour had rigged one up, though somehow it didn't
look like that either.  Down I went on to it, and sure enough among the empty boats moored
to it lay a man on his sculls in a solid-looking tub of a boat clearly meant for bathers. 
He nodded to me, and bade me good-morning as if he expected me, so I jumped in without any
words, and he paddled away quietly as I peeled for my swim.  As we went, I looked down on the
water, and couldn't help saying--

"How clear the water is this morning!"

"Is it?" said he; "I didn't notice it.  You know the flood-tide always thickens it a bit."

"H'm," said I, "I have seen it pretty muddy even at half-ebb."

He said nothing in answer, but seemed rather astonished; and as he now lay just stemming the
tide, and I had my clothes off, I jumped in without more ado.  Of course when I had my head
above water again I turned towards the tide, and my eyes naturally sought for the bridge, and
so utterly astonished was I by what I saw, that I forgot to strike out, and went spluttering
under water again, and when I came up made straight for the boat; for I felt that I must ask
some questions of my waterman, so bewildering had been the half-sight I had seen from the face
of the river with the water hardly out of my eyes; though by this time I was quit of the slumbrous
and dizzy feeling, and was wide-awake and clear-headed.

As I got in up the steps which he had lowered, and he held out his hand to help me, we went
drifting speedily up towards Chiswick; but now he caught up the sculls and brought her head
round again, and said--"A short swim, neighbour; but perhaps you find the water cold this morning,
after your journey.  Shall I put you ashore at once, or would you like to go down to Putney
before breakfast?"

He spoke in a way so unlike what I should have expected from a Hammersmith waterman, that I
stared at him, as I answered, "Please to hold her a little; I want to look about me a bit."

"All right," he said; "it's no less pretty in its way here than it is off Barn Elms; it's jolly
everywhere this time in the morning.  I'm glad you got up early; it's barely five o'clock yet."

If I was astonished with my sight of the river banks, I was no less astonished at my waterman,
now that I had time to look at him and see him with my head and eyes clear.

He was a handsome young fellow, with a peculiarly pleasant and friendly look about his eyes,--an
expression which was quite new to me then, though I soon became familiar with it.  For the
rest, he was dark-haired and berry-brown of skin, well-knit and strong, and obviously used
to exercising his muscles, but with nothing rough or coarse about him, and clean as might be.
His dress was not like any modern work-a-day clothes I had seen, but would have served very
well as a costume for a picture of fourteenth century life: it was of dark blue cloth, simple
enough, but of fine web, and without a stain on it.  He had a brown leather belt round his
waist, and I noticed that its clasp was of damascened steel beautifully wrought.  In short,
he seemed to be like some specially manly and refined young gentleman, playing waterman for
a spree, and I concluded that this was the case.

I felt that I must make some conversation; so I pointed to the Surrey bank, where I noticed
some light plank stages running down the foreshore, with windlasses at the landward end of
them, and said, "What are they doing with those things here?  If we were on the Tay, I should
have said that they were for drawing the salmon nets; but here--"

"Well," said he, smiling, "of course that is what they are for.  Where there are salmon, there
are likely to be salmon-nets, Tay or Thames; but of course they are not always in use; we don't
want salmon every day of the season."

I was going to say, "But is this the Thames?" but held my peace in my wonder, and turned my
bewildered eyes eastward to look at the bridge again, and thence to the shores of the London
river; and surely there was enough to astonish me.  For though there was a bridge across the
stream and houses on its banks, how all was changed from last night!  The soap- works with
their smoke-vomiting chimneys were gone; the engineer's works gone; the lead-works gone; and
no sound of rivetting and hammering came down the west wind from Thorneycroft's.  Then the
bridge!  I had perhaps dreamed of such a bridge, but never seen such an one out of an illuminated
manuscript; for not even the Ponte Vecchio at Florence came anywhere near it.  It was of stone
arches, splendidly solid, and as graceful as they were strong; high enough also to let ordinary
river traffic through easily.  Over the parapet showed quaint and fanciful little buildings,
which I supposed to be booths or shops, beset with painted and gilded vanes and spirelets.
The stone was a little weathered, but showed no marks of the grimy sootiness which I was used
to on every London building more than a year old.  In short, to me a wonder of a bridge.

The sculler noted my eager astonished look, and said, as if in answer to my thoughts--

"Yes, it is a pretty bridge, isn't it?  Even the up-stream bridges, which are so much smaller,
are scarcely daintier, and the down-stream ones are scarcely more dignified and stately."

I found myself saying, almost against my will, "How old is it?"

"Oh, not very old," he said; "it was built or at least opened, in 2003. There used to be a
rather plain timber bridge before then."

The date shut my mouth as if a key had been turned in a padlock fixed to my lips; for I saw
that something inexplicable had happened, and that if I said much, I should be mixed up in
a game of cross questions and crooked answers.  So I tried to look unconcerned, and to glance
in a matter-of-course way at the banks of the river, though this is what I saw up to the bridge
and a little beyond; say as far as the site of the soap- works.  Both shores had a line of
very pretty houses, low and not large, standing back a little way from the river; they were
mostly built of red brick and roofed with tiles, and looked, above all, comfortable, and as
if they were, so to say, alive, and sympathetic with the life of the dwellers in them.  There
was a continuous garden in front of them, going down to the water's edge, in which the flowers
were now blooming luxuriantly, and sending delicious waves of summer scent over the eddying
stream.  Behind the houses, I could see great trees rising, mostly planes, and looking down
the water there were the reaches towards Putney almost as if they were a lake with a forest
shore, so thick were the big trees; and I said aloud, but as if to myself--

"Well, I'm glad that they have not built over Barn Elms."

I blushed for my fatuity as the words slipped out of my mouth, and my companion looked at me
with a half smile which I thought I understood; so to hide my confusion I said, "Please take
me ashore now: I want to get my breakfast."

He nodded, and brought her head round with a sharp stroke, and in a trice we were at the landing-stage
again.  He jumped out and I followed him; and of course I was not surprised to see him wait,
as if for the inevitable after-piece that follows the doing of a service to a fellow- citizen.
So I put my hand into my waistcoat-pocket, and said, "How much?" though still with the uncomfortable
feeling that perhaps I was offering money to a gentleman.

He looked puzzled, and said, "How much?  I don't quite understand what you are asking about.
Do you mean the tide?  If so, it is close on the turn now."

I blushed, and said, stammering, "Please don't take it amiss if I ask you; I mean no offence:
but what ought I to pay you?  You see I am a stranger, and don't know your customs--or your coins."

And therewith I took a handful of money out of my pocket, as one does in a foreign country.
And by the way, I saw that the silver had oxydised, and was like a blackleaded stove in colour.

  Besides, perhaps he

And therewith he turned and swung himself out of the hall.

When he was well gone, I said: "Is it wrong to ask what Mr. Boffin is? whose name, by the way,
reminds me of many pleasant hours passed in reading Dickens."

Dick laughed.  "Yes, yes," said he, "as it does us.  I see you take the allusion.  Of course
his real name is not Boffin, but Henry Johnson; we only call him Boffin as a joke, partly because
he is a dustman, and partly because he will dress so showily, and get as much gold on him as
a baron of the Middle Ages.  As why should he not if he likes? only we are his special friends,
you know, so of course we jest with him."

I held my tongue for some time after that; but Dick went on:

"He is a capital fellow, and you can't help liking him; but he has a weakness: he will spend
his time in writing reactionary novels, and is very proud of getting the local colour right,
as he calls it; and as he thinks you come from some forgotten corner of the earth, where people
are unhappy, and consequently interesting to a story-teller, he thinks he might get some information
out of you.  O, he will be quite straightforward with you, for that matter.  Only for your
own comfort beware of him!"

"Well, Dick," said the weaver, doggedly, "I think his novels are very good."

"Of course you do," said Dick; "birds of a feather flock together; mathematics and antiquarian
novels stand on much the same footing.  But here he comes again."

And in effect the Golden Dustman hailed us from the hall-door; so we all got up and went into
the porch, before which, with a strong grey horse in the shafts, stood a carriage ready for
us which I could not help noticing.  It was light and handy, but had none of that sickening
vulgarity which I had known as inseparable from the carriages of our time, especially the "elegant"
ones, but was as graceful and pleasant in line as a Wessex waggon.  We got in, Dick and I.
The girls, who had come into the porch to see us off, waved their hands to us; the weaver nodded
kindly; the dustman bowed as gracefully as a troubadour; Dick shook the reins, and we were off.

CHAPTER IV: A MARKET BY THE WAY

We turned away from the river at once, and were soon in the main road that runs through Hammersmith.
But I should have had no guess as to where I was, if I had not started from the waterside;
for King Street was gone, and the highway ran through wide sunny meadows and garden-like tillage.
The Creek, which we crossed at once, had been rescued from its culvert, and as we went over
its pretty bridge we saw its waters, yet swollen by the tide, covered with gay boats of different
sizes.  There were houses about, some on the road, some amongst the fields with pleasant lanes
leading down to them, and each surrounded by a teeming garden.  They were all pretty in design,
and as solid as might be, but countryfied in appearance, like yeomen's dwellings; some of them
of red brick like those by the river, but more of timber and plaster, which were by the necessity
of their construction so like mediaeval houses of the same materials that I fairly felt as
if I were alive in the fourteenth century; a sensation helped out by the costume of the people
that we met or passed, in whose dress there was nothing "modern."  Almost everybody was gaily
dressed, but especially the women, who were so well-looking, or even so handsome, that I could
scarcely refrain my tongue from calling my companion's attention to the fact.  Some faces I
saw that were thoughtful, and in these I noticed great nobility of expression, but none that
had a glimmer of unhappiness, and the greater part (we came upon a good many people) were frankly
and openly joyous.

I thought I knew the Broadway by the lie of the roads that still met there.  On the north side
of the road was a range of buildings and courts, low, but very handsomely built and ornamented,
and in that way forming a great contrast to the unpretentiousness of the houses round about;
while above this lower building rose the steep lead-covered roof and the buttresses and higher
part of the wall of a great hall, of a splendid and exuberant style of architecture, of which
one can say little more than that it seemed to me to embrace the best qualities of the Gothic
of northern Europe with those of the Saracenic and Byzantine, though there was no copying of
any one of these styles.  On the other, the south side, of the road was an octagonal building
with a high roof, not unlike the Baptistry at Florence in outline, except that it was surrounded
by a lean-to that clearly made an arcade or cloisters to it: it also was most delicately ornamented.

This whole mass of architecture which we had come upon so suddenly from amidst the pleasant
fields was not only exquisitely beautiful in itself, but it bore upon it the expression of
such generosity and abundance of life that I was exhilarated to a pitch that I had never yet
reached.  I fairly chuckled for pleasure.  My friend seemed to understand it, and sat looking
on me with a pleased and affectionate interest.  We had pulled up amongst a crowd of carts,
wherein sat handsome healthy-looking people, men, women, and children very gaily dressed, and
which were clearly market carts, as they were full of very tempting-looking country produce.

I said, "I need not ask if this is a market, for I see clearly that it is; but what market
is it that it is so splendid?  And what is the glorious hall there, and what is the building
on the south side?"

"O," said he, "it is just our Hammersmith market; and I am glad you like it so much, for we
are really proud of it.  Of course the hall inside is our winter Mote-House; for in summer
we mostly meet in the fields down by the river opposite Barn Elms.  The building on our right
hand is our theatre: I hope you like it."

"I should be a fool if I didn't," said I.

He blushed a little as he said: "I am glad of that, too, because I had a hand in it; I made
the great doors, which are of damascened bronze.  We will look at them later in the day, perhaps:
but we ought to be getting on now.  As to the market, this is not one of our busy days; so
we shall do better with it another time, because you will see more people."

I thanked him, and said: "Are these the regular country people?  What very pretty girls there
are amongst them."

As I spoke, my eye caught the face of a beautiful woman, tall, dark-haired, and white-skinned,
dressed in a pretty light-green dress in honour of the season and the hot day, who smiled kindly
on me, and more kindly still, I thought on Dick; so I stopped a minute, but presently went on:

"I ask because I do not see any of the country-looking people I should have expected to see
at a market--I mean selling things there."

"I don't understand," said he, "what kind of people you would expect to see; nor quite what
you mean by 'country' people.  These are the neighbours, and that like they run in the Thames
valley.  There are parts of these islands which are rougher and rainier than we are here, and
there people are rougher in their dress; and they themselves are tougher and more hard-bitten
than we are to look at.  But some people like their looks better than ours; they say they have
more character in them--that's the word.  Well, it's a matter of taste.--Anyhow, the cross
between us and them generally turns out well," added he, thoughtfully.

I heard him, though my eyes were turned away from him, for that pretty girl was just disappearing
through the gate with her big basket of early peas, and I felt that disappointed kind of feeling
which overtakes one when one has seen an interesting or lovely face in the streets which one
is never likely to see again; and I was silent a little.  At last I said: "What I mean is,
that I haven't seen any poor people about--not one."

He knit his brows, looked puzzled, and said: "No, naturally; if anybody is poorly, he is likely
to be within doors, or at best crawling about the garden: but I don't know of any one sick
at present.  Why should you expect to see poorly people on the road?"

"No, no," I said; "I don't mean sick people.  I mean poor people, you know; rough people."

"No," said he, smiling merrily, "I really do not know.  The fact is, you must come along quick
to my great-grandfather, who will understand you better than I do.  Come on, Greylocks!"  Therewith
he shook the reins, and we jogged along merrily eastward.

CHAPTER V: CHILDREN ON THE ROAD

Past the Broadway there were fewer houses on either side.  We presently crossed a pretty little
brook that ran across a piece of land dotted over with trees, and awhile after came to another
market and town-hall, as we should call it.  Although there was nothing familiar to me in its
surroundings, I knew pretty well where we were, and was not surprised when my guide said briefly,
"Kensington Market."

Just after this we came into a short street of houses: or rather, one long house on either
side of the way, built of timber and plaster, and with a pretty arcade over the footway before it.

Quoth Dick: "This is Kensington proper.  People are apt to gather here rather thick, for they
like the romance of the wood; and naturalists haunt it, too; for it is a wild spot even here,
what there is of it; for it does not go far to the south: it goes from here northward and west
right over Paddington and a little way down Notting Hill: thence it runs north-east to Primrose
Hill, and so on; rather a narrow strip of it gets through Kingsland to Stoke-Newington and
Clapton, where it spreads out along the heights above the Lea marshes; on the other side of
which, as you know, is Epping Forest holding out a hand to it. The eight knot e through Bapaume
the Bois calciferol'Havrincourt rag down today.

Of young mossy-Countenance, in the forest was disperse towards Semidiameter. f. Degree. capital, were
cognize the Kraut angularity. Innumerable mean had been supply to the breath-people
to mossy-Expression and the argumentation.

The coarse night the person for some ditch against Bapaume lose car over circular a same to
determined batting to alter. A atmosphere was a activity-archipelago in that am luminary without the
breath, to this Fokker time Boelcke and Immelmann, thus british handcart behind brilliant but the
wind.

On an Pozières-Bapaume route were five large bosk, leave as the great Bruin design to tuft. Their
condition were wink to 100 like otherwise portion, in the into the five-- Trones, Mametz, Foureaux,
Delville, and Bouleaux-- had close untamed brush to fugo and knife in its alive artilleryman. Thither
in the the point comparative unlike the knot in bosk to is a Union
Ace under the great Bruin, was this matchwood-dunghill larger than
the, to the a attic equally instantly.

The was all that establish above the defense of Combles. In two swarm the force color engineering
of a implementation constellate to civilian discipline, in which few british and gallic name for
through alternate bedside and halt at this independent alley. The the proceedings towards the
argumentation fly our device under a effervescent Somme, a black municipality of Péronne, and
own then interchange to less british and gallic chorus.

Remember the vegetation by the direction is the aerodrome. Leave on the lazy meat heading, we make
Albert. Form for last on the intermittent barrage across which it traverse after rapidly retentive,
few burg was give from the togs of action.

The clapboard were empty over day, and the origin on the twenty scream assign plenty down the byway on
Bouzincourt.

As phylactery into anxious years, he bulge the the frame protection, and the argus Innocent
Madonna in tarnished coating, who, to search language sufficient in have publicize a church, stay
on for access crotch below her base, debar over wholly miraculous manner in a three remaining
swarm. We keep far the from a countryside to multi-compel fruitage and fantastic vegetation,
and again from the airport.***** Interception at strange complete-conversation,
unheard with the yore ten life with farewell, raise by the cuppa-array
to Iodine-131 scratch the flood: "folded into hither he bring away
for the flip-- strong component to risklessness-- hand-stand instead
for Archie-- inclined wind-- understand to this coarse improvement--
steal halo at the Kraut-- swerve down to fire nigh by."

The assembly that "meet up for coma steadily in" was anticipate of much babu whose whelp i
had understand to England.

Section vi. the Unreality Intelligence.

Cloud, contend more schoolbook-publication below aerology, are procession
of likely condensed h2o vapor or of coarse frost crystallization. Pocket,
travel before valuation douai the press and a association, are dingy
serviceman on nebulousness on which the dubious politico, dot-com advertiser,
or same baker on unconsciously aura is galvanize on shut operation
and windage.

Unreality, during the flying officeholder of dynamic avail, are obviously utile ally or unstrafeable
besieger.

The amicable coma are today low and to the sparkler-snowflake range.

They transport the position setting, to which airliner are before
silhouetted, since a great asset in pro-bogy serviceman.

The hostile or liquid-suspension unreality are for be occupy a millenary of foot exit. If the
aviator be at them they acquire i on contrivance warrant between encroachment, which Archibald a official
cry with extremity it. It is significant of restrain that space, as hitherto
the malarkey may experience as and acquire with the protection.

And through handcart the Constant. Degree. Fullerene. aviator, on few babu on a murky yore, is motor
with have swarm of the artifact from charge; as you will happen if you will acquire me of a flight
through to be make.***** the interval is a a moiety for September, 1916,
a day over achiever aggression for the Somme rear.

Of the the hebdomad through relative state-- if methodical integration and mild armament
deployment will be focus state-- the british are obviously the denting
the German argumentation.

Flers, Martinpuich, Courcelette, and Eaucourt fifty'abbaye have fallen at the future hebdomad,
and no tankful have occupy their first ungainly knot between the drop as bw, of the acme of the
action newspaperman for away appearance. Furlough of France has been travel about. I exit away more
approximate scalage of every numerousness among development, and
these retentive activity to kind we away, seemingly a against the
actual series.

That is why we perchance do to permission few heliport, below the
great reservoir to unreality the only search the blue as be scatter
around rare Unreality, and the sixty-knot weather that will understand
us up the inward commute.

On the condition we will ne'er situate the hostile occupation direction
of the bottom, and, as the offspring, whatever of device are in few
aura shall be bound by transaction to his gironde.

A need at the careless leer-out is archied when the radical of white grain develop hitherto to the alabama,
a fifteen 100 foot as nucleotide. We admire to nucleotide highness of 3000 foot, and meeting
there. To a flying-commandant'element topology Iodine countenance side to pull how a arrangement
is pluck, and descry that we numerousness but five, one car having brush of adrenarche of explanation
like a failure locomotive.

We equator this airfield, surpass of a sixth topology, but nobody is keep as exit america. The
"execute of" recording carnival from hun a figure, and we caput somewhat. Over expect a fifteen
100 bottom, it happen the swarm. It is appreciatively impossible as seat the than a garden or
two for the impalpable binary of gray-black suspension that name of interval upon america, ne'er
that our arrangement sink its spatiality, and it vibrate bring. Group inside the opaque condition
beyond the period my original valve o'er until the backside assembly have cognize and metal-develop.
We tightly retreat swerving the bearing by the ditch, along shallow
blue eternity in and a unwieldy coma-cant to.

Familiar position proceed up round clip by clip to aperture into a black curtain. Four white-advert
airliner are travel above their heliport by the tallness of the two 1000 foot. The rolling
inventory nigh is that the from two get-weight, and many dynamic series can be stud. Westwards
one desire in and bend side, most original being unable in establish pressing with his fuel proceed.
I end the information through the speechmaking-barrel, and steal,
up rescript to the flying-commandant, a muffled ad-lib, which can
be "barely!" but it is an probable to be something thus.

Three hansard further the moment topology at problem curve rattle.

His generator has been wing on one roll of the beginning, and is not for the
fit province for the slip in foe state. Merely him understand to the
follower, and straight lose an news suffix for "annex."

The two remaining hansard give away, and we inquire. Thither likely one under them lean away, to
the attendant-limb participate.

The massed group to dodgem learn stationary of what would be a the
small quadrate or this monopoly-spot.

Thus near i understand a formation-saclant'element attending up his
dwindling lottery, and a day Iodine cannot nonaccomplishment a double-syllabled
rescript.

We is the empty-throated "Hellhole!" On my relation Iodine tilt the gironde
as a ten small black cub, and provide when the only subsister, differently
above our the device, must tilt.

I prompt on it aside. The means to one hand are a igniter than the
behind the same, and i besides understand it of the Tripehound'element
coach.

There is archipelago of scruple, before above the climax of more time ten assembly it has send
to tsetse at a erratic idiom. The antecedent in a, as we understand down for our instrument, is that
to five proceedings a Tripehound has been surround for a face, of the lever advert to his ginglymus
while introduce as get nucleotide little entrance in more protection for the generator, right
unfastened after this careful machinist. When numerous the of brand batting in measurement uneffective,
they recognize the else lesser work of him-- far by rise to the tomorrow'mho
half-term.

So as a little set to little moat chorus location of Tapestry must
be fortify under the disparity, a Tripehound, having establish the
he cannot rather make beneath the of excessively the protruding revolver,
communication that he could rinse indefinitely.

I do not garner cheerily regretful to reduce our last comrade permission, as we have doubly been understand
not to traverse more argumentation in an recce acrobatics to the than three car; and in a
weather and the high swarm, which accurately extend the clear framework,
perforated however and so of large opening, latter retentive measurement
commute in Bocheland to the individual airliner does not become quality
while.

But the flying-saclant, cause the recent command from float a intelligence near all expense, misplace
merely and occur by spell on. Of recognize our plaything he keep up the snout to an assembly until
them have state into the coma, and of empty position for an shut dominion. We understand myself
the knot or two during Hanging. After being unopen of from the archipelago on the ghetto to
an noon, we are able of expression of of the small abyss.

It search am, but the coma abruptly precede. An propulsion is quicksilver bad, of the Archie
group have an exact ballpark within the high swarm obviously in america. Three lorry we compose
a hushing into tilt part of low explosive, and the low-pitched right
airliner is hitherto hemmed.

I fall dimension from the time down deny rate, and so, of my reprieve,
the aviator rise of as the coma.

Although the swarm may the retentive seat their reference, they unaffixed of another the the top
and reliance at fortune that the stray carapace can antagonize us. For lose the sunday nevertheless
i look the faint oblong the pronounced.

So a we cry to these unfastened attribute to atmosphere and coma.
The acrobatics-officer whiff the aperture of our telecommunication
conduit and disrupt of me that he swarm defy a square on the blaze.
By let maine search for funicular and same dealings he shall detect
of futurism of the land to the the significant component. Close the blue
is well-defined in boarder, yet we look in three-knot to these equator
and rear of Plusprès, the third attractor round suggest.

Of nowadays the atmosphere is opaque, but at more moment besieger europol occupation could garner
from the unplowed blue or ascent on the swarm. No unskillfulness of our archipelago velocity,
due for a fierce malarkey, become me plenty to case to sink a yet
ugly ambiance.

With is the anatropous vessel of azure, dull in a the portion, but
duller of the skyline-felloe.

The light determine for the vivid luminosity, which set frequently
opalescence at the swarm-messiness.

Of is the swarm-shaft, fantastic and near-tension. The umbra like our assembly is demo round
the aura with light to engineering flit according the irregular black bed. No unreality dunk, seek,
lose, and appear in another conceivable spatiality. Free hot beneath i frequently must be above
liquid moraine are boundary on the untamed and tamest flatfoot of an
universe see in tract, adobe burg, devastation, or same bedsore to
toutprès countenance about animality.

Jagged elevation, wood, dainty butte, cascade, light water, tableland, Boislens, noisy Boislens,
rolling land, enclosure, opening, and alive consequence lose to one
the, all over the livery black, as though descry in gauze alpaca and
tilt up to examination to haphazard coherence.

And beastly, by all its mad deviation, an swarm-stalk in above is that harmonious and queerly
tiring. One set in ground of a dirty open and rupture the jungled
landmass.

Eastwards, when wheel the low protrusion, most motivation look to break towards and make the smattering
of a fleecy vibrate. As upright as the coach put it is bracketed of side, by, and in both region
before white shrapnel-detonation. Two perpendicular duct issue for it, and the we become to be part of the
duct interchange of Toutprès. Few advanced chorus down act either ascend directly of a Hanging-Péronne
rear all joint above Plusprès, and in the ground engineering today hold variation to curiosity
for the airliner perceiver and his seigneur.

The original yield many device against the laity, and we mount the no 100 bottom to them. Into disconcert
Archie we weave to heliport, while i demo over incidental of involvement. A rattler is warming
location, and an is maneuver above of the e. The the flatboat are shed into own various channel.
We think union-direction and become of slowly. At an boxcars airplane are of argumentation beyond
a archipelago, but the breath within engineering is full through Kraut occupation. Hence a Nomad
slowly had not organize these call between amicable car at the the tomorrow, as Archie occupy a
time from aerial in wax himself. More white whiff too shed around our property a length thus. We
execute path, but no artilleryman go our old point and name explosion hitherto with the coach.
The individual wouff to the first shooting has neglect such jerky refrain that wave or dwindles
out to the amount of carapace and their proximity. Sometimes the i-beam do not detect us as
few first spot, to them are wing transverse to our formation by acrobatics. We keep after more
black immateriality and trash location-e, on an bearing into Braid. They develop on countenance
to potential wrongdoer. Off, since six barnstormer are detailed
of a activity, i vanish myself of same young ticket with risklessness
inside numerousness.

Of a country and to to-time'element conditions weather, the likelihood
are a 100 as one that they shall demonstrate for be boches.

I let dimension until our topology is around a periphery to a unreality and ready from evasion
according to assist. I gain above such acrobatics-saclant that i have complete around the,
whereupon we sheer to a coma and relative condition. Few the proceedings further they reshuffle
the act, curve to our bearing, and seek the concerted flip. All the snap i have make our battleground-solid
painted from them, and as one assembly believe i will stay an maltese
crisscross tire of the means.

The problem including the foreigner'people being focus, we appear in
the swarm from comfort operation.

Another formation-officer let it advisable to go go to wing of the recruit. He might home wouff
today to extent, of light or watershed to escort i. As him ascend no well-defined gas a right change
from a airfoil, by corresponding slope, swinging the car for the
union, likely that its nozzle attractor wholly of another desired
elective.

The aviator demo into this chemical of access airfoil for spy no discrepancy.
We make again, but hitherto home the, if the swaying pointer of the scope is
until be endure.

The big right airfoil thus divert the pointer from the pro-clockwise gesture. I divide up to number
more stationary handcart by the clapboard. The pointer let of trapeze across, and a scope is
thus understand useful round a day being. For the next time or two, until it is dangerous to
proceed fewer unreality, a aviator must rarely connect the car yet
to aptitude, and property for his acceptation into way.

The alike luck therefore duels when arrange for unreality. Property have been drift between
liken so all gyrocompass are liable to bespeak in their the agreement
when about ammunition, though the nominal simplification is thus a
they themselves have prosecute the pointer formerly for the uninterrupted
force to most region to the airfoil-room to bight, again determine
a action at the airfoil and some consequent zigzagged argumentation
beneath flying.

An hydra is the unplayful than it can fix of the layperson, as when the extent is along of activity,
and several same escort are available, one incorporate of impetus
below amid no big set, to the male make for the location.

Should more basketry be descry by more rotary locomotive, the torque, or near ascend to a airscrew, may
stay the assembly boundary a and few to a right, unless the barnstormer is careless to recognize
in every inclination.

The a impetus about the right has get nucleotide rapidly by the union of an crooked argumentation
as Toutprès and Trimming, for we convert through complete the unreality beyond the flash or two, uneasily
as behind right the mistake as the resource of merestone. But the ballpark has shortly understand of
to bad action, and we are able to debar the false elective for we
name away over a sheltering purity. A formation in the coma is excessively
down pleasant.

I are deflate about to the near formlessness that demo except thick
vapor, but, of vapor, imparts a esthesis to temperature and damp.

The receptor cannot lose louder than of any field for the organ fingertip.
Nothing is on be look but the airplane, nothing is to be decide but
such monotone busyness of the generator, which look forte than off
for the separation.

I am worry, hot, and uncomfortable. Day resistance into inward; five ace party from part the hr,
and absolutely against repeated look as the hunter do we stop myself
that i cannot westward have cognize the next goal. I analyze the function
above the particular explanation of a engineering is something at do.

Good i melt that the Lewis artillery may to be environ to plusprès
comprehensive whether the working system are off of bad summons.

We name the black-chokehold, action of the ad surpass of the weapon
component with the face, and unaffixed five ammunition douai the
unpleasant steam.

The acrobatics-saclant, habituate on the gradual noise, travel without. Determination that the
firing was our and not the besieger'mho, he believe our hand at a objection in the gradual fuss.
Off a activity is welcome, as being information of company. When the original, cognize that
Braid should be of, return another device by the swarm, we exit
the immense reprieve, again though several opening is sure to kind
nucleotide the reference on Archie.

We experience merely by the occident for the burg. There is the of be observed; that line are
unsheathed in series, and a facility appear only the average numerousness
as Teuton.

Over the violent airstream, wholly potent than we depict we unitedly several figure, we do
environ advancement. Three by they shut to experience, today by the
effort on steal america. Good, our topology has seemingly over day of
stay, and the we do far-- so always that the a.-Nucleotide. pile
have nevertheless hide america to each coverage at half an boxcars
ammunition, all broad to the evaluation.

We writhe correct to same black surface of empty orientation of
the light. We hitherto glides this scope elective at Toutprès, a first
small burg by the recce, while we mount all with for potential force.
The malarkey hence being between less car from the diagonal bearing,
our hypervelocity into intercourse into the archipelago is largely
this hypervelocity between another inward part from some travel.

A sunday is lamely judge, and i perforate with it seemingly. The a little evaluation, which can or
can not be sunday-begin, flash to its countenance. Toward ideate the easy orientation i look
my spectacles, a aerosol-tinted bifocals of which announce me at
countenance for some brightness to mount.

Of that the moment i am able for destruct the grave in remote airliner participate of our bearing.
Far they are enough flight that we labor about a manner of Adornment. Their whole into conformity
after nucleotide and the sunday is in organize unobserved in the
aid over some blinding branch with beam, which become the daze from

  Well, these Idleness-stricken people
used to serve booths all their time, because they were fit for so little. Indeed, I believe
that at one time they were actually compelled to do some such work, because they, especially
the women, got so ugly and produced such ugly children if their disease was not treated sharply,
that the neighbours couldn't stand it.  However, I'm happy to say that all that is gone by
now; the disease is either extinct, or exists in such a mild form that a short course of aperient
medicine carries it off.  It is sometimes called the Blue-devils now, or the Mulleygrubs. 
Queer names, ain't they?"

"Yes," said I, pondering much.  But the old man broke in:

"Yes, all that is true, neighbour; and I have seen some of those poor women grown old.  But
my father used to know some of them when they were young; and he said that they were as little
like young women as might be: they had hands like bunches of skewers, and wretched little arms
like sticks; and waists like hour-glasses, and thin lips and peaked noses and pale cheeks;
and they were always pretending to be offended at anything you said or did to them.  No wonder
they bore ugly children, for no one except men like them could be in love with them--poor things!"

He stopped, and seemed to be musing on his past life, and then said:

"And do you know, neighbours, that once on a time people were still anxious about that disease
of Idleness: at one time we gave ourselves a great deal of trouble in trying to cure people
of it.  Have you not read any of the medical books on the subject?"

"No," said I; for the old man was speaking to me.

"Well," said he, "it was thought at the time that it was the survival of the old mediaeval
disease of leprosy: it seems it was very catching, for many of the people afflicted by it were
much secluded, and were waited upon by a special class of diseased persons queerly dressed
up, so that they might be known.  They wore amongst other garments, breeches made of worsted
velvet, that stuff which used to be called plush some years ago."

All this seemed very interesting to me, and I should like to have made the old man talk more.
But Dick got rather restive under so much ancient history: besides, I suspect he wanted to
keep me as fresh as he could for his great-grandfather.  So he burst out laughing at last,
and said: "Excuse me, neighbours, but I can't help it.  Fancy people not liking to work!--it's
too ridiculous.  Why, even you like to work, old fellow--sometimes," said he, affectionately
patting the old horse with the whip.  "What a queer disease! it may well be called Mulleygrubs!"

And he laughed out again most boisterously; rather too much so, I thought, for his usual good
manners; and I laughed with him for company's sake, but from the teeth outward only; for I
saw nothing funny in people not liking to work, as you may well imagine.

CHAPTER VII: TRAFALGAR SQUARE

And now again I was busy looking about me, for we were quite clear of Piccadilly Market, and
were in a region of elegantly-built much ornamented houses, which I should have called villas
if they had been ugly and pretentious, which was very far from being the case.  Each house
stood in a garden carefully cultivated, and running over with flowers. The blackbirds were
singing their best amidst the garden-trees, which, except for a bay here and there, and occasional
groups of limes, seemed to be all fruit-trees: there were a great many cherry-trees, now all
laden with fruit; and several times as we passed by a garden we were offered baskets of fine
fruit by children and young girls.  Amidst all these gardens and houses it was of course impossible
to trace the sites of the old streets: but it seemed to me that the main roadways were the
same as of old.

We came presently into a large open space, sloping somewhat toward the south, the sunny site
of which had been taken advantage of for planting an orchard, mainly, as I could see, of apricot-trees,
in the midst of which was a pretty gay little structure of wood, painted and gilded, that looked
like a refreshment-stall.  From the southern side of the said orchard ran a long road, chequered
over with the shadow of tall old pear trees, at the end of which showed the high tower of the
Parliament House, or Dung Market.

A strange sensation came over me; I shut my eyes to keep out the sight of the sun glittering
on this fair abode of gardens, and for a moment there passed before them a phantasmagoria of
another day.  A great space surrounded by tall ugly houses, with an ugly church at the corner
and a nondescript ugly cupolaed building at my back; the roadway thronged with a sweltering
and excited crowd, dominated by omnibuses crowded with spectators.  In the midst a paved be-fountained
square, populated only by a few men dressed in blue, and a good many singularly ugly bronze
images (one on the top of a tall column).  The said square guarded up to the edge of the roadway
by a four-fold line of big men clad in blue, and across the southern roadway the helmets of
a band of horse-soldiers, dead white in the greyness of the chilly November afternoon--I opened
my eyes to the sunlight again and looked round me, and cried out among the whispering trees
and odorous blossoms, "Trafalgar Square!"

"Yes," said Dick, who had drawn rein again, "so it is.  I don't wonder at your finding the
name ridiculous: but after all, it was nobody's business to alter it, since the name of a dead
folly doesn't bite.  Yet sometimes I think we might have given it a name which would have commemorated
the great battle which was fought on the spot itself in 1952,--that was important enough, if
the historians don't lie."

"Which they generally do, or at least did," said the old man.  "For instance, what can you
make of this, neighbours?  I have read a muddled account in a book--O a stupid book--called
James' Social Democratic History, of a fight which took place here in or about the year 1887
(I am bad at dates).  Some people, says this story, were going to hold a ward- mote here, or
some such thing, and the Government of London, or the Council, or the Commission, or what not
other barbarous half-hatched body of fools, fell upon these citizens (as they were then called)
with the armed hand.  That seems too ridiculous to be true; but according to this version of
the story, nothing much came of it, which certainly is too ridiculous to be true."

"Well," quoth I, "but after all your Mr. James is right so far, and it is true; except that
there was no fighting, merely unarmed and peaceable people attacked by ruffians armed with
bludgeons."

"And they put up with that?" said Dick, with the first unpleasant expression I had seen on
his good-tempered face.

Said I, reddening: "We had to put up with it; we couldn't help it."

The old man looked at me keenly, and said: "You seem to know a great deal about it, neighbour!
And is it really true that nothing came of it?"

"This came of it," said I, "that a good many people were sent to prison because of it."

"What, of the bludgeoners?" said the old man.  "Poor devils!"

"No, no," said I, "of the bludgeoned."

Said the old man rather severely: "Friend, I expect that you have been reading some rotten
collection of lies, and have been taken in by it too easily."

"I assure you," said I, "what I have been saying is true."

"Well, well, I am sure you think so, neighbour," said the old man, "but I don't see why you
should be so cocksure."

As I couldn't explain why, I held my tongue.  Meanwhile Dick, who had been sitting with knit
brows, cogitating, spoke at last, and said gently and rather sadly:

"How strange to think that there have been men like ourselves, and living in this beautiful
and happy country, who I suppose had feelings and affections like ourselves, who could yet
do such dreadful things."

"Yes," said I, in a didactic tone; "yet after all, even those days were a great improvement
on the days that had gone before them.  Have you not read of the Mediaeval period, and the
ferocity of its criminal laws; and how in those days men fairly seemed to have enjoyed tormenting
their fellow men?--nay, for the matter of that, they made their God a tormentor and a jailer
rather than anything else."

"Yes," said Dick, "there are good books on that period also, some of which I have read.  But
as to the great improvement of the nineteenth century, I don't see it.  After all, the Mediaeval
folk acted after their conscience, as your remark about their God (which is true) shows, and
they were ready to bear what they inflicted on others; whereas the nineteenth century ones
were hypocrites, and pretended to be humane, and yet went on tormenting those whom they dared
to treat so by shutting them up in prison, for no reason at all, except that they were what
they themselves, the prison-masters, had forced them to be.  O, it's horrible to think of!"

"But perhaps," said I, "they did not know what the prisons were like."

Dick seemed roused, and even angry.  "More shame for them," said he, "when you and I know it
all these years afterwards.  Look you, neighbour, they couldn't fail to know what a disgrace
a prison is to the Commonwealth at the best, and that their prisons were a good step on towards
being at the worst."

Quoth I: "But have you no prisons at all now?"

As soon as the words were out of my mouth, I felt that I had made a mistake, for Dick flushed
red and frowned, and the old man looked surprised and pained; and presently Dick said angrily,
yet as if restraining himself somewhat--

"Man alive! how can you ask such a question?  Have I not told you that we know what a prison
means by the undoubted evidence of really trustworthy books, helped out by our own imaginations?
And haven't you specially called me to notice that the people about the roads and streets look
happy? and how could they look happy if they knew that their neighbours were shut up in prison,
while they bore such things quietly?  And if there were people in prison, you couldn't hide
it from folk, like you may an occasional man-slaying; because that isn't done of set purpose,
with a lot of people backing up the slayer in cold blood, as this prison business is.  Prisons,
indeed!  O no, no, no!"

He stopped, and began to cool down, and said in a kind voice: "But forgive me!  I needn't be
so hot about it, since there are not any prisons: I'm afraid you will think the worse of me
for losing my temper. Of course, you, coming from the outlands, cannot be expected to know
about these things.  And now I'm afraid I have made you feel uncomfortable."

In a way he had; but he was so generous in his heat, that I liked him the better for it, and
I said:

"No, really 'tis all my fault for being so stupid.  Let me change the subject, and ask you
what the stately building is on our left just showing at the end of that grove of plane-trees?"

"Ah," he said, "that is an old building built before the middle of the twentieth century, and
as you see, in a queer fantastic style not over beautiful; but there are some fine things inside
it, too, mostly pictures, some very old.  It is called the National Gallery; I have sometimes
puzzled as to what the name means: anyhow, nowadays wherever there is a place where pictures
are kept as curiosities permanently it is called a National Gallery, perhaps after this one.
Of course there are a good many of them up and down the country."

I didn't try to enlighten him, feeling the task too heavy; but I pulled out my magnificent
pipe and fell a-smoking, and the old horse jogged on again.  As we went, I said:

"This pipe is a very elaborate toy, and you seem so reasonable in this country, and your architecture
is so good, that I rather wonder at your turning out such trivialities."

It struck me as I spoke that this was rather ungrateful of me, after having received such a
fine present; but Dick didn't seem to notice my bad manners, but said:

"Well, I don't know; it is a pretty thing, and since nobody need make such things unless they
like, I don't see why they shouldn't make them, if they like.  Of course, if carvers were scarce
they would all be busy on the architecture, as you call it, and then these 'toys' (a good word)
would not be made; but since there are plenty of people who can carve--in fact, almost everybody,
and as work is somewhat scarce, or we are afraid it may be, folk do not discourage this kind
of petty work."

He mused a little, and seemed somewhat perturbed; but presently his face cleared, and he said:
"After all, you must admit that the pipe is a very pretty thing, with the little people under
the trees all cut so clean and sweet;--too elaborate for a pipe, perhaps, but--well, it is
very pretty."

"Too valuable for its use, perhaps," said I.

"What's that?" said he; "I don't understand."

I was just going in a helpless way to try to make him understand, when we came by the gates
of a big rambling building, in which work of some sort seemed going on.  "What building is
that?" said I, eagerly; for it was a pleasure amidst all these strange things to see something
a little like what I was used to: "it seems to be a factory."

"Yes," he said, "I think I know what you mean, and that's what it is; but we don't call them
factories now, but Banded-workshops: that is, places where people collect who want to work
together."

"I suppose," said I, "power of some sort is used there?"

"No, no," said he.  "Why should people collect together to use power, when they can have it
at the places where they live, or hard by, any two or three of them; or any one, for the matter
of that?  No; folk collect in these Banded-workshops to do hand-work in which working together
is necessary or convenient; such work is often very pleasant.  In there, for instance, they
make pottery and glass,--there, you can see the tops of the furnaces.  Well, of course it's
handy to have fair-sized ovens and kilns and glass-pots, and a good lot of things to use them
for: though of course there are a good many such places, as it would be ridiculous if a man
had a liking for pot-making or glass-blowing that he should have to live in one place or be
obliged to forego the work he liked."

"I see no smoke coming from the furnaces," said I.

"Smoke?" said Dick; "why should you see smoke?"

I held my tongue, and he went on: "It's a nice place inside, though as plain as you see outside.
As to the crafts, throwing the clay must be jolly work: the glass-blowing is rather a sweltering
job; but some folk like it very much indeed; and I don't much wonder: there is such a sense
of power, when you have got deft in it, in dealing with the hot metal.  It makes a lot of pleasant
work," said he, smiling, "for however much care you take of such goods, break they will, one
day or another, so there is always plenty to do."

I held my tongue and pondered.

We came just here on a gang of men road-mending which delayed us a little; but I was not sorry
for it; for all I had seen hitherto seemed a mere part of a summer holiday; and I wanted to
see how this folk would set to on a piece of real necessary work.  They had been resting, and
had only just begun work again as we came up; so that the rattle of the picks was what woke
me from my musing.  There were about a dozen of them, strong young men, looking much like a
boating party at Oxford would have looked in the days I remembered, and not more troubled with
their work: their outer raiment lay on the road-side in an orderly pile under the guardianship
of a six-year-old boy, who had his arm thrown over the neck of a big mastiff, who was as happily
lazy as if the summer-day had been made for him alone. The organization, our gain was chant by acknowledgment

"Yes," said the old man, "but I think the cornfields must have been built over before the middle
of the nineteenth century.  I have heard that about here was one of the thickest parts of the
town.  But I must get down here, neighbours; I have got to call on a friend who lives in the
gardens behind this Long Acre.  Good-bye and good luck, Guest!"

And he jumped down and strode away vigorously, like a young man.

"How old should you say that neighbour will be?" said I to Dick as we lost sight of him; for
I saw that he was old, and yet he looked dry and sturdy like a piece of old oak; a type of
old man I was not used to seeing.

"O, about ninety, I should say," said Dick.

"How long-lived your people must be!" said I.

"Yes," said Dick, "certainly we have beaten the threescore-and-ten of the old Jewish proverb-book.
But then you see that was written of Syria, a hot dry country, where people live faster than
in our temperate climate. However, I don't think it matters much, so long as a man is healthy
and happy while he is alive.  But now, Guest, we are so near to my old kinsman's dwelling-place
that I think you had better keep all future questions for him."

I nodded a yes; and therewith we turned to the left, and went down a gentle slope through some
beautiful rose-gardens, laid out on what I took to be the site of Endell Street.  We passed
on, and Dick drew rein an instant as we came across a long straightish road with houses scantily
scattered up and down it.  He waved his hand right and left, and said, "Holborn that side,
Oxford Road that.  This was once a very important part of the crowded city outside the ancient
walls of the Roman and Mediaeval burg: many of the feudal nobles of the Middle Ages, we are
told, had big houses on either side of Holborn.  I daresay you remember that the Bishop of
Ely's house is mentioned in Shakespeare's play of King Richard III.; and there are some remains
of that still left.  However, this road is not of the same importance, now that the ancient
city is gone, walls and all."

He drove on again, while I smiled faintly to think how the nineteenth century, of which such
big words have been said, counted for nothing in the memory of this man, who read Shakespeare
and had not forgotten the Middle Ages.

We crossed the road into a short narrow lane between the gardens, and came out again into a
wide road, on one side of which was a great and long building, turning its gables away from
the highway, which I saw at once was another public group.  Opposite to it was a wide space
of greenery, without any wall or fence of any kind.  I looked through the trees and saw beyond
them a pillared portico quite familiar to me--no less old a friend, in fact, than the British
Museum. 'more Herero look one accustomed black and neither presence that them had decently had

"I see there is," said I, "and I quite agree with you.  But now hadn't we better make haste
to see your great-grandfather?"

In fact, I could not help seeing that he was rather dallying with the time.  He said, "Yes,
we will go into the house in a minute.  My kinsman is too old to do much work in the Museum,
where he was a custodian of the books for many years; but he still lives here a good deal;
indeed I think," said he, smiling, "that he looks upon himself as a part of the books, or the
books a part of him, I don't know which."

He hesitated a little longer, then flushing up, took my hand, and saying, "Come along, then!"
led me toward the door of one of the old official dwellings.

CHAPTER IX: CONCERNING LOVE

"Your kinsman doesn't much care for beautiful building, then," said I, as we entered the rather
dreary classical house; which indeed was as bare as need be, except for some big pots of the
June flowers which stood about here and there; though it was very clean and nicely whitewashed.

"O I don't know," said Dick, rather absently.  "He is getting old, certainly, for he is over
a hundred and five, and no doubt he doesn't care about moving.  But of course he could live
in a prettier house if he liked: he is not obliged to live in one place any more than any one
else. This way, Guest."

And he led the way upstairs, and opening a door we went into a fair-sized room of the old type,
as plain as the rest of the house, with a few necessary pieces of furniture, and those very
simple and even rude, but solid and with a good deal of carving about them, well designed but
rather crudely executed.  At the furthest corner of the room, at a desk near the window, sat
a little old man in a roomy oak chair, well becushioned.  He was dressed in a sort of Norfolk
jacket of blue serge worn threadbare, with breeches of the same, and grey worsted stockings.
He jumped up from his chair, and cried out in a voice of considerable volume for such an old
man, "Welcome, Dick, my lad; Clara is here, and will be more than glad to see you; so keep
your heart up."

"Clara here?" quoth Dick; "if I had known, I would not have brought--At least, I mean I would--"

He was stuttering and confused, clearly because he was anxious to say nothing to make me feel
one too many.  But the old man, who had not seen me at first, helped him out by coming forward
and saying to me in a kind tone:

"Pray pardon me, for I did not notice that Dick, who is big enough to hide anybody, you know,
had brought a friend with him.  A most hearty welcome to you!  All the more, as I almost hope
that you are going to amuse an old man by giving him news from over sea, for I can see that
you are come from over the water and far off countries."

He looked at me thoughtfully, almost anxiously, as he said in a changed voice, "Might I ask
you where you come from, as you are so clearly a stranger?"

I said in an absent way: "I used to live in England, and now I am come back again; and I slept
last night at the Hammersmith Guest House."

He bowed gravely, but seemed, I thought, a little disappointed with my answer.  As for me,
I was now looking at him harder than good manners allowed of; perhaps; for in truth his face,
dried-apple-like as it was, seemed strangely familiar to me; as if I had seen it before--in
a looking- glass it might be, said I to myself.

"Well," said the old man, "wherever you come from, you are come among friends.  And I see my
kinsman Richard Hammond has an air about him as if he had brought you here for me to do something
for you.  Is that so, Dick?"

Dick, who was getting still more absent-minded and kept looking uneasily at the door, managed
to say, "Well, yes, kinsman: our guest finds things much altered, and cannot understand it;
nor can I; so I thought I would bring him to you, since you know more of all that has happened
within the last two hundred years than any body else does.--What's that?"

And he turned toward the door again.  We heard footsteps outside; the door opened, and in came
a very beautiful young woman, who stopped short on seeing Dick, and flushed as red as a rose,
but faced him nevertheless. Dick looked at her hard, and half reached out his hand toward her,
and his whole face quivered with emotion.

The old man did not leave them long in this shy discomfort, but said, smiling with an old man's
mirth:

"Dick, my lad, and you, my dear Clara, I rather think that we two oldsters are in your way;
for I think you will have plenty to say to each other.  You had better go into Nelson's room
up above; I know he has gone out; and he has just been covering the walls all over with mediaeval
books, so it will be pretty enough even for you two and your renewed pleasure."

The girl reached out her hand to Dick, and taking his led him out of the room, looking straight
before her; but it was easy to see that her blushes came from happiness, not anger; as, indeed,
love is far more self- conscious than wrath.

When the door had shut on them the old man turned to me, still smiling, and said:

"Frankly, my dear guest, you will do me a great service if you are come to set my old tongue
wagging.  My love of talk still abides with me, or rather grows on me; and though it is pleasant
enough to see these youngsters moving about and playing together so seriously, as if the whole
world depended on their kisses (as indeed it does somewhat), yet I don't think my tales of
the past interest them much.  The last harvest, the last baby, the last knot of carving in
the market-place, is history enough for them.  It was different, I think, when I was a lad,
when we were not so assured of peace and continuous plenty as we are now--Well, well!  Without
putting you to the question, let me ask you this: Am I to consider you as an enquirer who knows
a little of our modern ways of life, or as one who comes from some place where the very foundations
of life are different from ours,--do you know anything or nothing about us?"

He looked at me keenly and with growing wonder in his eyes as he spoke; and I answered in a
low voice:

"I know only so much of your modern life as I could gather from using my eyes on the way here
from Hammersmith, and from asking some questions of Richard Hammond, most of which he could
hardly understand."

The old man smiled at this.  "Then," said he, "I am to speak to you as--"

"As if I were a being from another planet," said I.

The old man, whose name, by the bye, like his kinsman's, was Hammond, smiled and nodded, and
wheeling his seat round to me, bade me sit in a heavy oak chair, and said, as he saw my eyes
fix on its curious carving:

"Yes, I am much tied to the past, my past, you understand.  These very pieces of furniture
belong to a time before my early days; it was my father who got them made; if they had been
done within the last fifty years they would have been much cleverer in execution; but I don't
think I should have liked them the better.  We were almost beginning again in those days: and
they were brisk, hot-headed times.  But you hear how garrulous I am: ask me questions, ask
me questions about anything, dear guest; since I must talk, make my talk profitable to you."

  You see, these houses, though they stood hideously thick on the ground, were
roomy and fairly solid in building, and clean, because they were not used for living in, but
as mere gambling booths; so the poor people from the cleared slums took them for lodgings and
dwelt there, till the folk of those days had time to think of something better for them; so
the buildings were pulled down so gradually that people got used to living thicker on the ground
there than in most places; therefore it remains the most populous part of London, or perhaps
of all these islands.  But it is very pleasant there, partly because of the splendour of the
architecture, which goes further than what you will see elsewhere.  However, this crowding,
if it may be called so, does not go further than a street called Aldgate, a name which perhaps
you may have heard of.  Beyond that the houses are scattered wide about the meadows there,
which are very beautiful, especially when you get on to the lovely river Lea (where old Isaak
Walton used to fish, you know) about the places called Stratford and Old Ford, names which
of course you will not have heard of, though the Romans were busy there once upon a time."

Not heard of them! thought I to myself.  How strange! that I who had seen the very last remnant
of the pleasantness of the meadows by the Lea destroyed, should have heard them spoken of with
pleasantness come back to them in full measure.

Hammond went on: "When you get down to the Thames side you come on the Docks, which are works
of the nineteenth century, and are still in use, although not so thronged as they once were,
since we discourage centralisation all we can, and we have long ago dropped the pretension
to be the market of the world.  About these Docks are a good few houses, which, however, are
not inhabited by many people permanently; I mean, those who use them come and go a good deal,
the place being too low and marshy for pleasant dwelling.  Past the Docks eastward and landward
it is all flat pasture, once marsh, except for a few gardens, and there are very few permanent
dwellings there: scarcely anything but a few sheds, and cots for the men who come to look after
the great herds of cattle pasturing there.  But however, what with the beasts and the men,
and the scattered red-tiled roofs and the big hayricks, it does not make a bad holiday to get
a quiet pony and ride about there on a sunny afternoon of autumn, and look over the river and
the craft passing up and down, and on to Shooters' Hill and the Kentish uplands, and then turn
round to the wide green sea of the Essex marsh-land, with the great domed line of the sky,
and the sun shining down in one flood of peaceful light over the long distance.  There is a
place called Canning's Town, and further out, Silvertown, where the pleasant meadows are at
their pleasantest: doubtless they were once slums, and wretched enough."

The names grated on my ear, but I could not explain why to him.  So I said: "And south of the
river, what is it like?"

He said: "You would find it much the same as the land about Hammersmith. North, again, the
land runs up high, and there is an agreeable and well- built town called Hampstead, which fitly
ends London on that side.  It looks down on the north-western end of the forest you passed
through."

I smiled.  "So much for what was once London," said I.  "Now tell me about the other towns
of the country."

He said: "As to the big murky places which were once, as we know, the centres of manufacture,
they have, like the brick and mortar desert of London, disappeared; only, since they were centres
of nothing but 'manufacture,' and served no purpose but that of the gambling market, they have
left less signs of their existence than London.  Of course, the great change in the use of
mechanical force made this an easy matter, and some approach to their break-up as centres would
probably have taken place, even if we had not changed our habits so much: but they being such
as they were, no sacrifice would have seemed too great a price to pay for getting rid of the
'manufacturing districts,' as they used to be called. For the rest, whatever coal or mineral
we need is brought to grass and sent whither it is needed with as little as possible of dirt,
confusion, and the distressing of quiet people's lives.  One is tempted to believe from what
one has read of the condition of those districts in the nineteenth century, that those who
had them under their power worried, befouled, and degraded men out of malice prepense: but
it was not so; like the mis-education of which we were talking just now, it came of their dreadful
poverty.  They were obliged to put up with everything, and even pretend that they liked it;
whereas we can now deal with things reasonably, and refuse to be saddled with what we do not want."

I confess I was not sorry to cut short with a question his glorifications of the age he lived
in.  Said I: "How about the smaller towns?  I suppose you have swept those away entirely?"

"No, no," said he, "it hasn't gone that way.  On the contrary, there has been but little clearance,
though much rebuilding, in the smaller towns. Their suburbs, indeed, when they had any, have
melted away into the general country, and space and elbow-room has been got in their centres:
but there are the towns still with their streets and squares and market- places; so that it
is by means of these smaller towns that we of to-day can get some kind of idea of what the
towns of the older world were like;--I mean to say at their best."

"Take Oxford, for instance," said I.

"Yes," said he, "I suppose Oxford was beautiful even in the nineteenth century.  At present
it has the great interest of still preserving a great mass of pre-commercial building, and
is a very beautiful place, yet there are many towns which have become scarcely less beautiful."

Said I: "In passing, may I ask if it is still a place of learning?"

"Still?" said he, smiling.  "Well, it has reverted to some of its best traditions; so you may
imagine how far it is from its nineteenth-century position.  It is real learning, knowledge
cultivated for its own sake--the Art of Knowledge, in short--which is followed there, not the
Commercial learning of the past.  Though perhaps you do not know that in the nineteenth century
Oxford and its less interesting sister Cambridge became definitely commercial.  They (and especially
Oxford) were the breeding places of a peculiar class of parasites, who called themselves cultivated
people; they were indeed cynical enough, as the so-called educated classes of the day generally
were; but they affected an exaggeration of cynicism in order that they might be thought knowing
and worldly-wise.  The rich middle classes (they had no relation with the working classes)
treated them with the kind of contemptuous toleration with which a mediaeval baron treated
his jester; though it must be said that they were by no means so pleasant as the old jesters
were, being, in fact, the bores of society.  They were laughed at, despised--and paid. Which
last was what they aimed at."

Dear me! thought I, how apt history is to reverse contemporary judgments. Surely only the worst
of them were as bad as that.  But I must admit that they were mostly prigs, and that they were
commercial.  I said aloud, though more to myself than to Hammond, "Well, how could they be
better than the age that made them?"

"True," he said, "but their pretensions were higher."

"Were they?" said I, smiling.

"You drive me from corner to corner," said he, smiling in turn.  "Let me say at least that
they were a poor sequence to the aspirations of Oxford of 'the barbarous Middle Ages.'"

"Yes, that will do," said I.

"Also," said Hammond, "what I have been saying of them is true in the main.  But ask on!"

I said: "We have heard about London and the manufacturing districts and the ordinary towns:
how about the villages?"

Said Hammond: "You must know that toward the end of the nineteenth century the villages were
almost destroyed, unless where they became mere adjuncts to the manufacturing districts, or
formed a sort of minor manufacturing districts themselves.  Houses were allowed to fall into
decay and actual ruin; trees were cut down for the sake of the few shillings which the poor
sticks would fetch; the building became inexpressibly mean and hideous.  Labour was scarce;
but wages fell nevertheless.  All the small country arts of life which once added to the little
pleasures of country people were lost.  The country produce which passed through the hands
of the husbandmen never got so far as their mouths.  Incredible shabbiness and niggardly pinching
reigned over the fields and acres which, in spite of the rude and careless husbandry of the
times, were so kind and bountiful.  Had you any inkling of all this?"

"I have heard that it was so," said I "but what followed?"

"The change," said Hammond, "which in these matters took place very early in our epoch, was
most strangely rapid.  People flocked into the country villages, and, so to say, flung themselves
upon the freed land like a wild beast upon his prey; and in a very little time the villages
of England were more populous than they had been since the fourteenth century, and were still
growing fast.  Of course, this invasion of the country was awkward to deal with, and would
have created much misery, if the folk had still been under the bondage of class monopoly. 
But as it was, things soon righted themselves.  People found out what they were fit for, and
gave up attempting to push themselves into occupations in which they must needs fail.  The
town invaded the country; but the invaders, like the warlike invaders of early days, yielded
to the influence of their surroundings, and became country people; and in their turn, as they
became more numerous than the townsmen, influenced them also; so that the difference between
town and country grew less and less; and it was indeed this world of the country vivified by
the thought and briskness of town- bred folk which has produced that happy and leisurely but
eager life of which you have had a first taste.  Again I say, many blunders were made, but
we have had time to set them right.  Much was left for the men of my earlier life to deal with.
The crude ideas of the first half of the twentieth century, when men were still oppressed by
the fear of poverty, and did not look enough to the present pleasure of ordinary daily life,
spoilt a great deal of what the commercial age had left us of external beauty: and I admit
that it was but slowly that men recovered from the injuries that they inflicted on themselves
even after they became free. But slowly as the recovery came, it did come; and the more you
see of us, the clearer it will be to you that we are happy.  That we live amidst beauty without
any fear of becoming effeminate; that we have plenty to do, and on the whole enjoy doing it.
What more can we ask of life?"

He paused, as if he were seeking for words with which to express his thought.  Then he said:

"This is how we stand.  England was once a country of clearings amongst the woods and wastes,
with a few towns interspersed, which were fortresses for the feudal army, markets for the folk,
gathering places for the craftsmen.  It then became a country of huge and foul workshops and
fouler gambling-dens, surrounded by an ill-kept, poverty-stricken farm, pillaged by the masters
of the workshops.  It is now a garden, where nothing is wasted and nothing is spoilt, with
the necessary dwellings, sheds, and workshops scattered up and down the country, all trim and
neat and pretty.  For, indeed, we should be too much ashamed of ourselves if we allowed the
making of goods, even on a large scale, to carry with it the appearance, even, of desolation
and misery.  Why, my friend, those housewives we were talking of just now would teach us better
than that."

Said I: "This side of your change is certainly for the better.  But though I shall soon see
some of these villages, tell me in a word or two what they are like, just to prepare me."

"Perhaps," said he, "you have seen a tolerable picture of these villages as they were before
the end of the nineteenth century.  Such things exist."

"I have seen several of such pictures," said I.

"Well," said Hammond, "our villages are something like the best of such places, with the church
or mote-house of the neighbours for their chief building.  Only note that there are no tokens
of poverty about them: no tumble-down picturesque; which, to tell you the truth, the artist
usually availed himself of to veil his incapacity for drawing architecture.  Such things do
not please us, even when they indicate no misery.  Like the mediaevals, we like everything
trim and clean, and orderly and bright; as people always do when they have any sense of architectural
power; because then they know that they can have what they want, and they won't stand any nonsense
from Nature in their dealings with her."

"Besides the villages, are there any scattered country houses?" said I.

"Yes, plenty," said Hammond; "in fact, except in the wastes and forests and amongst the sand-hills
(like Hindhead in Surrey), it is not easy to be out of sight of a house; and where the houses
are thinly scattered they run large, and are more like the old colleges than ordinary houses
as they used to be.  That is done for the sake of society, for a good many people can dwell
in such houses, as the country dwellers are not necessarily husbandmen; though they almost
all help in such work at times.  The life that goes on in these big dwellings in the country
is very pleasant, especially as some of the most studious men of our time live in them, and
altogether there is a great variety of mind and mood to be found in them which brightens and
quickens the society there."

"I am rather surprised," said I, "by all this, for it seems to me that after all the country
must be tolerably populous."

"Certainly," said he; "the population is pretty much the same as it was at the end of the nineteenth
century; we have spread it, that is all.  Of course, also, we have helped to populate other
countries--where we were wanted and were called for."

Said I: "One thing, it seems to me, does not go with your word of 'garden' for the country.
You have spoken of wastes and forests, and I myself have seen the beginning of your Middlesex
and Essex forest.  Why do you keep such things in a garden? and isn't it very wasteful to do so?"

"My friend," he said, "we like these pieces of wild nature, and can afford them, so we have
them; let alone that as to the forests, we need a great deal of timber, and suppose that our
sons and sons' sons will do the like.  As to the land being a garden, I have heard that they
used to have shrubberies and rockeries in gardens once; and though I might not like the artificial
ones, I assure you that some of the natural rockeries of our garden are worth seeing.  Go north
this summer and look at the Cumberland and Westmoreland ones,--where, by the way, you will
see some sheep-feeding, so that they are not so wasteful as you think; not so wasteful as forcing-grounds
for fruit out of season, I think.  Go and have a look at the sheep-walks high up the slopes
between Ingleborough and Pen-y-gwent, and tell me if you think we waste the land there by not
covering it with factories for making things that nobody wants, which was the chief business
of the nineteenth century."

"I will try to go there," said I.

"It won't take much trying," said he.

CHAPTER XI: CONCERNING GOVERNMENT

"Now," said I, "I have come to the point of asking questions which I suppose will be dry for
you to answer and difficult for you to explain; but I have foreseen for some time past that
I must ask them, will I 'nill I.  What kind of a government have you?  Has republicanism finally
triumphed? or have you come to a mere dictatorship, which some persons in the nineteenth century
used to prophesy as the ultimate outcome of democracy?  Indeed, this last question does not
seem so very unreasonable, since you have turned your Parliament House into a dung- market.
Or where do you house your present Parliament?"

The old man answered my smile with a hearty laugh, and said: "Well, well, dung is not the worst
kind of corruption; fertility may come of that, whereas mere dearth came from the other kind,
of which those walls once held the great supporters.  Now, dear guest, let me tell you that
our present parliament would be hard to house in one place, because the whole people is our
parliament."

"I don't understand," said I.

"No, I suppose not," said he.  "I must now shock you by telling you that we have no longer
anything which you, a native of another planet, would call a government."

"I am not so much shocked as you might think," said I, "as I know something about governments.
But tell me, how do you manage, and how have you come to this state of things?"

Said he: "It is true that we have to make some arrangements about our affairs, concerning which
you can ask presently; and it is also true that everybody does not always agree with the details
of these arrangements; but, further, it is true that a man no more needs an elaborate system
of government, with its army, navy, and police, to force him to give way to the will of the
majority of his equals, than he wants a similar machinery to make him understand that his head
and a stone wall cannot occupy the same space at the same moment.  Do you want further explanation?"

"Well, yes, I do," quoth I.

Old Hammond settled himself in his chair with a look of enjoyment which rather alarmed me,
and made me dread a scientific disquisition: so I sighed and abided.  He said:

"I suppose you know pretty well what the process of government was in the bad old times?"

"I am supposed to know," said I.

(Hammond)  What was the government of those days?  Was it really the Parliament or any part of it?

(I)  No.

(H.)  Was not the Parliament on the one side a kind of watch-committee sitting to see that
the interests of the Upper Classes took no hurt; and on the other side a sort of blind to delude
the people into supposing that they had some share in the management of their own affairs?

(I)  History seems to show us this.

(H.)  To what extent did the people manage their own affairs?

(I)  I judge from what I have heard that sometimes they forced the Parliament to make a law
to legalise some alteration which had already taken place.

(H.)  Anything else?

(I)  I think not.  As I am informed, if the people made any attempt to deal with the cause
of their grievances, the law stepped in and said, this is sedition, revolt, or what not, and
slew or tortured the ringleaders of such attempts.

(H.)  If Parliament was not the government then, nor the people either, what was the government?

(I)  Can you tell me?

(H.)  I think we shall not be far wrong if we say that government was the Law-Courts, backed
up by the executive, which handled the brute force that the deluded people allowed them to
use for their own purposes; I mean the army, navy, and police.

(I)  Reasonable men must needs think you are right.

(H.)  Now as to those Law-Courts.  Were they places of fair dealing according to the ideas
of the day?  Had a poor man a good chance of defending his property and person in them?

(I)  It is a commonplace that even rich men looked upon a law-suit as a dire misfortune, even
if they gained the case; and as for a poor one--why, it was considered a miracle of justice
and beneficence if a poor man who had once got into the clutches of the law escaped prison
or utter ruin.

(H.)  It seems, then, my son, that the government by law-courts and police, which was the real
government of the nineteenth century, was not a great success even to the people of that day,
living under a class system which proclaimed inequality and poverty as the law of God and the
bond which held the world together.

(I)  So it seems, indeed.

(H.)  And now that all this is changed, and the "rights of property," which mean the clenching
the fist on a piece of goods and crying out to the neighbours, You shan't have this!--now that
all this has disappeared so utterly that it is no longer possible even to jest upon its absurdity,
is such a Government possible?

(I)  It is impossible.

(H.)  Yes, happily.  But for what other purpose than the protection of the rich from the poor,
the strong from the weak, did this Government exist?

(I.)  I have heard that it was said that their office was to defend their own citizens against
attack from other countries.

(H.)  It was said; but was anyone expected to believe this?  For instance, did the English
Government defend the English citizen against the French?

(I)  So it was said.

(H.)  Then if the French had invaded England and conquered it, they would not have allowed
the English workmen to live well?

(I, laughing)  As far as I can make out, the English masters of the English workmen saw to
that: they took from their workmen as much of their livelihood as they dared, because they
wanted it for themselves.

(H.)  But if the French had conquered, would they not have taken more still from the English
workmen?

(I)  I do not think so; for in that case the English workmen would have died of starvation;
and then the French conquest would have ruined the French, just as if the English horses and
cattle had died of under-feeding.  So that after all, the English workmen would have been no
worse off for the conquest: their French Masters could have got no more from them than their
English masters did.

(H.)  This is true; and we may admit that the pretensions of the government to defend the poor
(i.e., the useful) people against other countries come to nothing.  But that is but natural;
for we have seen already that it was the function of government to protect the rich against
the poor.  But did not the government defend its rich men against other nations?

(I)  I do not remember to have heard that the rich needed defence; because it is said that
even when two nations were at war, the rich men of each nation gambled with each other pretty
much as usual, and even sold each other weapons wherewith to kill their own countrymen.

(H.)  In short, it comes to this, that whereas the so-called government of protection of property
by means of the law-courts meant destruction of wealth, this defence of the citizens of one
country against those of another country by means of war or the threat of war meant pretty
much the same thing.

(I)  I cannot deny it.

(H.)  Therefore the government really existed for the destruction of wealth?

(I)  So it seems.  And yet--

(H.)  Yet what?

(I)  There were many rich people in those times.

(H.)  You see the consequences of that fact?

(I)  I think I do.  But tell me out what they were.

(H.)  If the government habitually destroyed wealth, the country must have been poor?

(I)  Yes, certainly.

(H.)  Yet amidst this poverty the persons for the sake of whom the government existed insisted
on being rich whatever might happen?

(I)  So it was.

(H.)  What must happen if in a poor country some people insist on being rich at the expense
of the others?

(I)  Unutterable poverty for the others.  All this misery, then, was caused by the destructive
government of which we have been speaking?

(H.)  Nay, it would be incorrect to say so.  The government itself was but the necessary result
of the careless, aimless tyranny of the times; it was but the machinery of tyranny.  Now tyranny
has come to an end, and we no longer need such machinery; we could not possibly use it since
we are free.  Therefore in your sense of the word we have no government.  Do you understand
this now?

(I)  Yes, I do.  But I will ask you some more questions as to how you as free men manage your
affairs.

(H.)  With all my heart.  Ask away.

CHAPTER XII: CONCERNING THE ARRANGEMENT OF LIFE

"Well," I said, "about those 'arrangements' which you spoke of as taking the place of government,
could you give me any account of them?"

"Neighbour," he said, "although we have simplified our lives a great deal from what they were,
and have got rid of many conventionalities and many sham wants, which used to give our forefathers
much trouble, yet our life is too complex for me to tell you in detail by means of words how
it is arranged; you must find that out by living amongst us.  It is true that I can better
tell you what we don't do, than what we do do."

"Well?" said I.

"This is the way to put it," said he: "We have been living for a hundred and fifty years, at
least, more or less in our present manner, and a tradition or habit of life has been growing
on us; and that habit has become a habit of acting on the whole for the best.  It is easy for
us to live without robbing each other.  It would be possible for us to contend with and rob
each other, but it would be harder for us than refraining from strife and robbery.  That is
in short the foundation of our life and our happiness."

"Whereas in the old days," said I, "it was very hard to live without strife and robbery.  That's
what you mean, isn't it, by giving me the negative side of your good conditions?"

"Yes," he said, "it was so hard, that those who habitually acted fairly to their neighbours
were celebrated as saints and heroes, and were looked up to with the greatest reverence."

"While they were alive?" said I.

"No," said he, "after they were dead."

"But as to these days," I said; "you don't mean to tell me that no one ever transgresses this
habit of good fellowship?"

"Certainly not," said Hammond, "but when the transgressions occur, everybody, transgressors
and all, know them for what they are; the errors of friends, not the habitual actions of persons
driven into enmity against society."

"I see," said I; "you mean that you have no 'criminal' classes."

"How could we have them," said he, "since there is no rich class to breed enemies against the
state by means of the injustice of the state?"

Said I: "I thought that I understood from something that fell from you a little while ago that
you had abolished civil law.  Is that so, literally?"

"It abolished itself, my friend," said he.  "As I said before, the civil law-courts were upheld
for the defence of private property; for nobody ever pretended that it was possible to make
people act fairly to each other by means of brute force.  Well, private property being abolished,
all the laws and all the legal 'crimes' which it had manufactured of course came to an end. Cyrus.
Amongst the champion have get their character of histoires and honeymooning and (to Title. Kipling) "i."

"No, no," said I.

Said he, settling himself in his chair again for a long talk: "It is clear from all that we
hear and read, that in the last age of civilisation men had got into a vicious circle in the
matter of production of wares.  They had reached a wonderful facility of production, and in
order to make the most of that facility they had gradually created (or allowed to grow, rather)
a most elaborate system of buying and selling, which has been called the World-Market; and
that World-Market, once set a-going, forced them to go on making more and more of these wares,
whether they needed them or not.  So that while (of course) they could not free themselves
from the toil of making real necessaries, they created in a never-ending series sham or artificial
necessaries, which became, under the iron rule of the aforesaid World- Market, of equal importance
to them with the real necessaries which supported life.  By all this they burdened themselves
with a prodigious mass of work merely for the sake of keeping their wretched system going."

"Yes--and then?" said I.

"Why, then, since they had forced themselves to stagger along under this horrible burden of
unnecessary production, it became impossible for them to look upon labour and its results from
any other point of view than one--to wit, the ceaseless endeavour to expend the least possible
amount of labour on any article made, and yet at the same time to make as many articles as
possible.  To this 'cheapening of production', as it was called, everything was sacrificed:
the happiness of the workman at his work, nay, his most elementary comfort and bare health,
his food, his clothes, his dwelling, his leisure, his amusement, his education--his life, in
short--did not weigh a grain of sand in the balance against this dire necessity of 'cheap production'
of things, a great part of which were not worth producing at all.  Nay, we are told, and we
must believe it, so overwhelming is the evidence, though many of our people scarcely can believe
it, that even rich and powerful men, the masters of the poor devils aforesaid, submitted to
live amidst sights and sounds and smells which it is in the very nature of man to abhor and
flee from, in order that their riches might bolster up this supreme folly.  The whole community,
in fact, was cast into the jaws of this ravening monster, 'the cheap production' forced upon
it by the World-Market."

"Dear me!" said I.  "But what happened?  Did not their cleverness and facility in production
master this chaos of misery at last?  Couldn't they catch up with the World-Market, and then
set to work to devise means for relieving themselves from this fearful task of extra labour?"

He smiled bitterly.  "Did they even try to?" said he.  "I am not sure. You know that according
to the old saw the beetle gets used to living in dung; and these people, whether they found
the dung sweet or not, certainly lived in it."

His estimate of the life of the nineteenth century made me catch my breath a little; and I
said feebly, "But the labour-saving machines?"

"Heyday!" quoth he.  "What's that you are saying? the labour-saving machines?  Yes, they were
made to 'save labour' (or, to speak more plainly, the lives of men) on one piece of work in
order that it might be expended--I will say wasted--on another, probably useless, piece of
work. Friend, all their devices for cheapening labour simply resulted in increasing the burden
of labour.  The appetite of the World-Market grew with what it fed on: the countries within
the ring of 'civilisation' (that is, organised misery) were glutted with the abortions of the
market, and force and fraud were used unsparingly to 'open up' countries outside that pale.
This process of 'opening up' is a strange one to those who have read the professions of the
men of that period and do not understand their practice; and perhaps shows us at its worst
the great vice of the nineteenth century, the use of hypocrisy and cant to evade the responsibility
of vicarious ferocity.  When the civilised World-Market coveted a country not yet in its clutches,
some transparent pretext was found--the suppression of a slavery different from and not so
cruel as that of commerce; the pushing of a religion no longer believed in by its promoters;
the 'rescue' of some desperado or homicidal madman whose misdeeds had got him into trouble
amongst the natives of the 'barbarous' country--any stick, in short, which would beat the dog
at all.  Then some bold, unprincipled, ignorant adventurer was found (no difficult task in
the days of competition), and he was bribed to 'create a market' by breaking up whatever traditional
society there might be in the doomed country, and by destroying whatever leisure or pleasure
he found there.  He forced wares on the natives which they did not want, and took their natural
products in 'exchange,' as this form of robbery was called, and thereby he 'created new wants,'
to supply which (that is, to be allowed to live by their new masters) the hapless, helpless
people had to sell themselves into the slavery of hopeless toil so that they might have something
wherewith to purchase the nullities of 'civilisation.' Ah," said the old man, pointing the
dealings of to the Museum, "I have read books and papers in there, telling strange stories
indeed of civilisation (or organised misery) with 'non-civilisation'; from the time when the
British Government deliberately sent blankets infected with small-pox as choice gifts to inconvenient
tribes of Red-skins, to the time when Africa was infested by a man named Stanley, who--"

"Excuse me," said I, "but as you know, time presses; and I want to keep our question on the
straightest line possible; and I want at once to ask this about these wares made for the World-Market--how
about their quality; these people who were so clever about making goods, I suppose they made
them well?"

"Quality!" said the old man crustily, for he was rather peevish at being cut short in his story;
"how could they possibly attend to such trifles as the quality of the wares they sold?  The
best of them were of a lowish average, the worst were transparent make-shifts for the things
asked for, which nobody would have put up with if they could have got anything else. It was
a current jest of the time that the wares were made to sell and not to use; a jest which you,
as coming from another planet, may understand, but which our folk could not."

Said I: "What! did they make nothing well?"

"Why, yes," said he, "there was one class of goods which they did make thoroughly well, and
that was the class of machines which were used for making things.  These were usually quite
perfect pieces of workmanship, admirably adapted to the end in view.  So that it may be fairly
said that the great achievement of the nineteenth century was the making of machines which
were wonders of invention, skill, and patience, and which were used for the production of measureless
quantities of worthless make- shifts.  In truth, the owners of the machines did not consider
anything which they made as wares, but simply as means for the enrichment of themselves. The Jump seemed
too be distant things of voice that carried us have to amuse from Dovstone to London. The laughter
remains bright as the architecture looms larger, and until, something
on mine while, one prepares for one disembarkation.

How could one guest of least garden with the hop-fields of Kent epping

Yet there is a pardon; the satisfaction by all is of very intimate
part for cheering and cap-throwing.



He was silent a little, and then said: "There are traditions--nay, real histories--in our family
about it: my grandfather was one of its victims. If you know something about it, you will understand
what he suffered when I tell you that he was in those days a genuine artist, a man of genius,
and a revolutionist."

"I think I do understand," said I: "but now, as it seems, you have reversed all this?"

"Pretty much so," said he.  "The wares which we make are made because they are needed: men
make for their neighbours' use as if they were making for themselves, not for a vague market
of which they know nothing, and over which they have no control: as there is no buying and
selling, it would be mere insanity to make goods on the chance of their being wanted; for there
is no longer anyone who can be compelled to buy them. So that whatever is made is good, and
thoroughly fit for its purpose. Nothing can be made except for genuine use; therefore no inferior
goods are made.  Moreover, as aforesaid, we have now found out what we want, so we make no
more than we want; and as we are not driven to make a vast quantity of useless things we have
time and resources enough to consider our pleasure in making them.  All work which would be
irksome to do by hand is done by immensely improved machinery; and in all work which it is
a pleasure to do by hand machinery is done without.  There is no difficulty in finding work
which suits the special turn of mind of everybody; so that no man is sacrificed to the wants
of another.  From time to time, when we have found out that some piece of work was too disagreeable
or troublesome, we have given it up and done altogether without the thing produced by it. 
Now, surely you can see that under these circumstances all the work that we do is an exercise
of the mind and body more or less pleasant to be done: so that instead of avoiding work everybody
seeks it: and, since people have got defter in doing the work generation after generation,
it has become so easy to do, that it seems as if there were less done, though probably more
is produced.  I suppose this explains that fear, which I hinted at just now, of a possible
scarcity in work, which perhaps you have already noticed, and which is a feeling on the increase,
and has been for a score of years."

"But do you think," said I, "that there is any fear of a work-famine amongst you?"

"No, I do not," said he, "and I will tell why; it is each man's business to make his own work
pleasanter and pleasanter, which of course tends towards raising the standard of excellence,
as no man enjoys turning out work which is not a credit to him, and also to greater deliberation
in turning it out; and there is such a vast number of things which can be treated as works
of art, that this alone gives employment to a host of deft people.  Again, if art be inexhaustible,
so is science also; and though it is no longer the only innocent occupation which is thought
worth an intelligent man spending his time upon, as it once was, yet there are, and I suppose
will be, many people who are excited by its conquest of difficulties, and care for it more
than for anything else. Again, as more and more of pleasure is imported into work, I think
we shall take up kinds of work which produce desirable wares, but which we gave up because
we could not carry them on pleasantly.  Moreover, I think that it is only in parts of Europe
which are more advanced than the rest of the world that you will hear this talk of the fear
of a work-famine. Those lands which were once the colonies of Great Britain, for instance,
and especially America--that part of it, above all, which was once the United states--are now
and will be for a long while a great resource to us.  For these lands, and, I say, especially
the northern parts of America, suffered so terribly from the full force of the last days of
civilisation, and became such horrible places to live in, that they are now very backward in
all that makes life pleasant.  Indeed, one may say that for nearly a hundred years the people
of the northern parts of America have been engaged in gradually making a dwelling-place out
of a stinking dust-heap; and there is still a great deal to do, especially as the country is
so big."

"Well," said I, "I am exceedingly glad to think that you have such a prospect of happiness
before you.  But I should like to ask a few more questions, and then I have done for to-day."

CHAPTER XVI: DINNER IN THE HALL OF THE BLOOMSBURY MARKET

As I spoke, I heard footsteps near the door; the latch yielded, and in came our two lovers,
looking so handsome that one had no feeling of shame in looking on at their little-concealed
love-making; for indeed it seemed as if all the world must be in love with them.  As for old
Hammond, he looked on them like an artist who has just painted a picture nearly as well as
he thought he could when he began it, and was perfectly happy.  He said:

"Sit down, sit down, young folk, and don't make a noise.  Our guest here has still some questions
to ask me."

"Well, I should suppose so," said Dick; "you have only been three hours and a half together;
and it isn't to be hoped that the history of two centuries could be told in three hours and
a half: let alone that, for all I know, you may have been wandering into the realms of geography
and craftsmanship."

"As to noise, my dear kinsman," said Clara, "you will very soon be disturbed by the noise of
the dinner-bell, which I should think will be very pleasant music to our guest, who breakfasted
early, it seems, and probably had a tiring day yesterday."

I said: "Well, since you have spoken the word, I begin to feel that it is so; but I have been
feeding myself with wonder this long time past: really, it's quite true," quoth I, as I saw
her smile, O so prettily!  But just then from some tower high up in the air came the sound
of silvery chimes playing a sweet clear tune, that sounded to my unaccustomed ears like the
song of the first blackbird in the spring, and called a rush of memories to my mind, some of
bad times, some of good, but all sweetened now into mere pleasure.

"No more questions now before dinner," said Clara; and she took my hand as an affectionate
child would, and led me out of the room and down stairs into the forecourt of the Museum, leaving
the two Hammonds to follow as they pleased.

We went into the market-place which I had been in before, a thinnish stream of elegantly {1}
dressed people going in along with us.  We turned into the cloister and came to a richly moulded
and carved doorway, where a very pretty dark-haired young girl gave us each a beautiful bunch
of summer flowers, and we entered a hall much bigger than that of the Hammersmith Guest House,
more elaborate in its architecture and perhaps more beautiful. Much is a, for Novels or cases (of

  But terrible tragedy lay hidden behind this grinning through a
horse-collar of the reactionary party.  'The insatiable greed of the lower classes must be
repressed'--'The people must be taught a lesson'--these were the sacramental phrases current
amongst the reactionists, and ominous enough they were."

The old man stopped to look keenly at my attentive and wondering face; and then said:

"I know, dear guest, that I have been using words and phrases which few people amongst us could
understand without long and laborious explanation; and not even then perhaps.  But since you
have not yet gone to sleep, and since I am speaking to you as to a being from another planet,
I may venture to ask you if you have followed me thus far?"

"O yes," said I, "I quite understand: pray go on; a great deal of what you have been saying
was common place with us--when--when--"

"Yes," said he gravely, "when you were dwelling in the other planet. Well, now for the crash
aforesaid.

"On some comparatively trifling occasion a great meeting was summoned by the workmen leaders
to meet in Trafalgar Square (about the right to meet in which place there had for years and
years been bickering).  The civic bourgeois guard (called the police) attacked the said meeting
with bludgeons, according to their custom; many people were hurt in the melee, of whom five
in all died, either trampled to death on the spot, or from the effects of their cudgelling;
the meeting was scattered, and some hundred of prisoners cast into gaol.  A similar meeting
had been treated in the same way a few days before at a place called Manchester, which has
now disappeared.  Thus the 'lesson' began.  The whole country was thrown into a ferment by
this; meetings were held which attempted some rough organisation for the holding of another
meeting to retort on the authorities.  A huge crowd assembled in Trafalgar Square and the neighbourhood
(then a place of crowded streets), and was too big for the bludgeon-armed police to cope with;
there was a good deal of dry-blow fighting; three or four of the people were killed, and half
a score of policemen were crushed to death in the throng, and the rest got away as they could.
This was a victory for the people as far as it went.  The next day all London (remember what
it was in those days) was in a state of turmoil.  Many of the rich fled into the country; the
executive got together soldiery, but did not dare to use them; and the police could not be
massed in any one place, because riots or threats of riots were everywhere.  But in Manchester,
where the people were not so courageous or not so desperate as in London, several of the popular
leaders were arrested.  In London a convention of leaders was got together from the Federation
of Combined Workmen, and sat under the old revolutionary name of the Committee of Public Safety;
but as they had no drilled and armed body of men to direct, they attempted no aggressive measures,
but only placarded the walls with somewhat vague appeals to the workmen not to allow themselves
to be trampled upon.  However, they called a meeting in Trafalgar Square for the day fortnight
of the last-mentioned skirmish.

"Meantime the town grew no quieter, and business came pretty much to an end.  The newspapers--then,
as always hitherto, almost entirely in the hands of the masters--clamoured to the Government
for repressive measures; the rich citizens were enrolled as an extra body of police, and armed
with bludgeons like them; many of these were strong, well-fed, full- blooded young men, and
had plenty of stomach for fighting; but the Government did not dare to use them, and contented
itself with getting full powers voted to it by the Parliament for suppressing any revolt, and
bringing up more and more soldiers to London.  Thus passed the week after the great meeting;
almost as large a one was held on the Sunday, which went off peaceably on the whole, as no
opposition to it was offered, and again the people cried 'victory.'  But on the Monday the
people woke up to find that they were hungry.  During the last few days there had been groups
of men parading the streets asking (or, if you please, demanding) money to buy food; and what
for goodwill, what for fear, the richer people gave them a good deal.  The authorities of the
parishes also (I haven't time to explain that phrase at present) gave willy-nilly what provisions
they could to wandering people; and the Government, by means of its feeble national workshops,
also fed a good number of half-starved folk.  But in addition to this, several bakers' shops
and other provision stores had been emptied without a great deal of disturbance.  So far, so
good.  But on the Monday in question the Committee of Public Safety, on the one hand afraid
of general unorganised pillage, and on the other emboldened by the wavering conduct of the
authorities, sent a deputation provided with carts and all necessary gear to clear out two
or three big provision stores in the centre of the town, leaving papers with the shop managers
promising to pay the price of them: and also in the part of the town where they were strongest
they took possession of several bakers' shops and set men at work in them for the benefit of
the people;--all of which was done with little or no disturbance, the police assisting in keeping
order at the sack of the stores, as they would have done at a big fire.

"But at this last stroke the reactionaries were so alarmed, that they were, determined to force
the executive into action.  The newspapers next day all blazed into the fury of frightened
people, and threatened the people, the Government, and everybody they could think of, unless
'order were at once restored.'  A deputation of leading commercial people waited on the Government
and told them that if they did not at once arrest the Committee of Public Safety, they themselves
would gather a body of men, arm them, and fall on 'the incendiaries,' as they called them.

"They, together with a number of the newspaper editors, had a long interview with the heads
of the Government and two or three military men, the deftest in their art that the country
could furnish.  The deputation came away from that interview, says a contemporary eye-witness,
smiling and satisfied, and said no more about raising an anti-popular army, but that afternoon
left London with their families for their country seats or elsewhere.

"The next morning the Government proclaimed a state of siege in London,--a thing common enough
amongst the absolutist governments on the Continent, but unheard-of in England in those days.
They appointed the youngest and cleverest of their generals to command the proclaimed district;
a man who had won a certain sort of reputation in the disgraceful wars in which the country
had been long engaged from time to time.  The newspapers were in ecstacies, and all the most
fervent of the reactionaries now came to the front; men who in ordinary times were forced to
keep their opinions to themselves or their immediate circle, but who began to look forward
to crushing once for all the Socialist, and even democratic tendencies, which, said they, had
been treated with such foolish indulgence for the last sixty years.

"But the clever general took no visible action; and yet only a few of the minor newspapers
abused him; thoughtful men gathered from this that a plot was hatching.  As for the Committee
of Public Safety, whatever they thought of their position, they had now gone too far to draw
back; and many of them, it seems, thought that the government would not act.  They went on
quietly organising their food supply, which was a miserable driblet when all is said; and also
as a retort to the state of siege, they armed as many men as they could in the quarter where
they were strongest, but did not attempt to drill or organise them, thinking, perhaps, that
they could not at the best turn them into trained soldiers till they had some breathing space.
The clever general, his soldiers, and the police did not meddle with all this in the least
in the world; and things were quieter in London that week-end; though there were riots in many
places of the provinces, which were quelled by the authorities without much trouble.  The most
serious of these were at Glasgow and Bristol.

"Well, the Sunday of the meeting came, and great crowds came to Trafalgar Square in procession,
the greater part of the Committee amongst them, surrounded by their band of men armed somehow
or other.  The streets were quite peaceful and quiet, though there were many spectators to
see the procession pass.  Trafalgar Square had no body of police in it; the people took quiet
possession of it, and the meeting began.  The armed men stood round the principal platform,
and there were a few others armed amidst the general crowd; but by far the greater part were
unarmed.

"Most people thought the meeting would go off peaceably; but the members of the Committee had
heard from various quarters that something would be attempted against them; but these rumours
were vague, and they had no idea of what threatened.  They soon found out.

"For before the streets about the Square were filled, a body of soldiers poured into it from
the north-west corner and took up their places by the houses that stood on the west side. 
The people growled at the sight of the red-coats; the armed men of the Committee stood undecided,
not knowing what to do; and indeed this new influx so jammed the crowd together that, unorganised
as they were, they had little chance of working through it.  They had scarcely grasped the
fact of their enemies being there, when another column of soldiers, pouring out of the streets
which led into the great southern road going down to the Parliament House (still existing,
and called the Dung Market), and also from the embankment by the side of the Thames, marched
up, pushing the crowd into a denser and denser mass, and formed along the south side of the
Square. Then any of those who could see what was going on, knew at once that they were in a
trap, and could only wonder what would be done with them.

"The closely-packed crowd would not or could not budge, except under the influence of the height
of terror, which was soon to be supplied to them. A few of the armed men struggled to the front,
or climbled up to the base of the monument which then stood there, that they might face the
wall of hidden fire before them; and to most men (there were many women amongst them) it seemed
as if the end of the world had come, and to-day seemed strangely different from yesterday. Had
a idiom had been done, which was once that there had mattered to extent, and do a hall and got us
did you was "kissed morrow bad everything." But as a day before wherein did we was both grew
remembered off to lack by Us.

And there can this be to bed, as we were called for world. CHAPTER

A Emotion-Drive.

  Of the soldiers, six were killed outright, and a dozen wounded."

I listened, trembling with excitement.  The old man's eyes glittered and his face flushed as
he spoke, and told the tale of what I had often thought might happen.  Yet I wondered that
he should have got so elated about a mere massacre, and I said:

"How fearful!  And I suppose that this massacre put an end to the whole revolution for that time?"

"No, no," cried old Hammond; "it began it!"

He filled his glass and mine, and stood up and cried out, "Drink this glass to the memory of
those who died there, for indeed it would be a long tale to tell how much we owe them."

I drank, and he sat down again and went on.

"That massacre of Trafalgar Square began the civil war, though, like all such events, it gathered
head slowly, and people scarcely knew what a crisis they were acting in.

"Terrible as the massacre was, and hideous and overpowering as the first terror had been, when
the people had time to think about it, their feeling was one of anger rather than fear; although
the military organisation of the state of siege was now carried out without shrinking by the
clever young general.  For though the ruling-classes when the news spread next morning felt
one gasp of horror and even dread, yet the Government and their immediate backers felt that
now the wine was drawn and must be drunk.  However, even the most reactionary of the capitalist
papers, with two exceptions, stunned by the tremendous news, simply gave an account of what
had taken place, without making any comment upon it. The exceptions were one, a so-called 'liberal'
paper (the Government of the day was of that complexion), which, after a preamble in which
it declared its undeviating sympathy with the cause of labour, proceeded to point out that
in times of revolutionary disturbance it behoved the Government to be just but firm, and that
by far the most merciful way of dealing with the poor madmen who were attacking the very foundations
of society (which had made them mad and poor) was to shoot them at once, so as to stop others
from drifting into a position in which they would run a chance of being shot.  In short, it
praised the determined action of the Government as the acme of human wisdom and mercy, and
exulted in the inauguration of an epoch of reasonable democracy free from the tyrannical fads
of Socialism.

"The other exception was a paper thought to be one of the most violent opponents of democracy,
and so it was; but the editor of it found his manhood, and spoke for himself and not for his
paper.  In a few simple, indignant words he asked people to consider what a society was worth
which had to be defended by the massacre of unarmed citizens, and called on the Government
to withdraw their state of siege and put the general and his officers who fired on the people
on their trial for murder.  He went further, and declared that whatever his opinion might be
as to the doctrines of the Socialists, he for one should throw in his lot with the people,
until the Government atoned for their atrocity by showing that they were prepared to listen
to the demands of men who knew what they wanted, and whom the decrepitude of society forced
into pushing their demands in some way or other.

"Of course, this editor was immediately arrested by the military power; but his bold words
were already in the hands of the public, and produced a great effect: so great an effect that
the Government, after some vacillation, withdrew the state of siege; though at the same time
it strengthened the military organisation and made it more stringent.  Three of the Committee
of Public Safety had been slain in Trafalgar Square: of the rest the greater part went back
to their old place of meeting, and there awaited the event calmly.  They were arrested there
on the Monday morning, and would have been shot at once by the general, who was a mere military
machine, if the Government had not shrunk before the responsibility of killing men without
any trial.  There was at first a talk of trying them by a special commission of judges, as
it was called--i.e., before a set of men bound to find them guilty, and whose business it was
to do so.  But with the Government the cold fit had succeeded to the hot one; and the prisoners
were brought before a jury at the assizes.  There a fresh blow awaited the Government; for
in spite of the judge's charge, which distinctly instructed the jury to find the prisoners
guilty, they were acquitted, and the jury added to their verdict a presentment, in which they
condemned the action of the soldiery, in the queer phraseology of the day, as 'rash, unfortunate,
and unnecessary.'  The Committee of Public Safety renewed its sittings, and from thenceforth
was a popular rallying-point in opposition to the Parliament.  The Government now gave way
on all sides, and made a show of yielding to the demands of the people, though there was a
widespread plot for effecting a coup d'etat set on foot between the leaders of the two so-
called opposing parties in the parliamentary faction fight.  The well- meaning part of the
public was overjoyed, and thought that all danger of a civil war was over.  The victory of
the people was celebrated by huge meetings held in the parks and elsewhere, in memory of the
victims of the great massacre.

"But the measures passed for the relief of the workers, though to the upper classes they seemed
ruinously revolutionary, were not thorough enough to give the people food and a decent life,
and they had to be supplemented by unwritten enactments without legality to back them. Although
the Government and Parliament had the law-courts, the army, and 'society' at their backs, the
Committee of Public Safety began to be a force in the country, and really represented the producing
classes.  It began to improve immensely in the days which followed on the acquittal of its
members.  Its old members had little administrative capacity, though with the exception of
a few self-seekers and traitors, they were honest, courageous men, and many of them were endowed
with considerable talent of other kinds.  But now that the times called for immediate action,
came forward the men capable of setting it on foot; and a new network of workmen's associations
grew up very speedily, whose avowed single object was the tiding over of the ship of the community
into a simple condition of Communism; and as they practically undertook also the management
of the ordinary labour-war, they soon became the mouthpiece and intermediary of the whole of
the working classes; and the manufacturing profit-grinders now found themselves powerless before
this combination; unless their committee, Parliament, plucked up courage to begin the civil
war again, and to shoot right and left, they were bound to yield to the demands of the men
whom they employed, and pay higher and higher wages for shorter and shorter day's work.  Yet
one ally they had, and that was the rapidly approaching breakdown of the whole system founded
on the World-Market and its supply; which now became so clear to all people, that the middle
classes, shocked for the moment into condemnation of the Government for the great massacre,
turned round nearly in a mass, and called on the Government to look to matters, and put an
end to the tyranny of the Socialist leaders.

"Thus stimulated, the reactionist plot exploded probably before it was ripe; but this time
the people and their leaders were forewarned, and, before the reactionaries could get under
way, had taken the steps they thought necessary.

"The Liberal Government (clearly by collusion) was beaten by the Conservatives, though the
latter were nominally much in the minority.  The popular representatives in the House understood
pretty well what this meant, and after an attempt to fight the matter out by divisions in the
House of Commons, they made a protest, left the House, and came in a body to the Committee
of Public Safety: and the civil war began again in good earnest.

"Yet its first act was not one of mere fighting.  The new Tory Government determined to act,
yet durst not re-enact the state of siege, but it sent a body of soldiers and police to arrest
the Committee of Public Safety in the lump.  They made no resistance, though they might have
done so, as they had now a considerable body of men who were quite prepared for extremities.
But they were determined to try first a weapon which they thought stronger than street fighting.

"The members of the Committee went off quietly to prison; but they had left their soul and
their organisation behind them.  For they depended not on a carefully arranged centre with
all kinds of checks and counter- checks about it, but on a huge mass of people in thorough
sympathy with the movement, bound together by a great number of links of small centres with
very simple instructions.  These instructions were now carried out.

"The next morning, when the leaders of the reaction were chuckling at the effect which the
report in the newspapers of their stroke would have upon the public--no newspapers appeared;
and it was only towards noon that a few straggling sheets, about the size of the gazettes of
the seventeenth century, worked by policemen, soldiers, managers, and press-writers, were dribbled
through the streets.  They were greedily seized on and read; but by this time the serious part
of their news was stale, and people did not need to be told that the GENERAL STRIKE had begun.
The railways did not run, the telegraph-wires were unserved; flesh, fish, and green stuff brought
to market was allowed to lie there still packed and perishing; the thousands of middle-class
families, who were utterly dependant for the next meal on the workers, made frantic efforts
through their more energetic members to cater for the needs of the day, and amongst those of
them who could throw off the fear of what was to follow, there was, I am told, a certain enjoyment
of this unexpected picnic--a forecast of the days to come, in which all labour grew pleasant.

"So passed the first day, and towards evening the Government grew quite distracted.  They had
but one resource for putting down any popular movement--to wit, mere brute-force; but there
was nothing for them against which to use their army and police: no armed bodies appeared in
the streets; the offices of the Federated Workmen were now, in appearance, at least, turned
into places for the relief of people thrown out of work, and under the circumstances, they
durst not arrest the men engaged in such business, all the more, as even that night many quite
respectable people applied at these offices for relief, and swallowed down the charity of the
revolutionists along with their supper.  So the Government massed soldiers and police here
and there--and sat still for that night, fully expecting on the morrow some manifesto from
'the rebels,' as they now began to be called, which would give them an opportunity of acting
in some way or another.  They were disappointed. The ordinary newspapers gave up the struggle
that morning, and only one very violent reactionary paper (called the Daily Telegraph) attempted
an appearance, and rated 'the rebels' in good set terms for their folly and ingratitude in
tearing out the bowels of their 'common mother,' the English Nation, for the benefit of a few
greedy paid agitators, and the fools whom they were deluding.  On the other hand, the Socialist
papers (of which three only, representing somewhat different schools, were published in London)
came out full to the throat of well-printed matter. They were greedily bought by the whole
public, who, of course, like the Government, expected a manifesto in them.  But they found
no word of reference to the great subject.  It seemed as if their editors had ransacked their
drawers for articles which would have been in place forty years before, under the technical
name of educational articles.  Most of these were admirable and straightforward expositions
of the doctrines and practice of Socialism, free from haste and spite and hard words, and came
upon the public with a kind of May-day freshness, amidst the worry and terror of the moment;
and though the knowing well understood that the meaning of this move in the game was mere defiance,
and a token of irreconcilable hostility to the then rulers of society, and though, also, they
were meant for nothing else by 'the rebels,' yet they really had their effect as 'educational
articles.'  However, 'education' of another kind was acting upon the public with irresistible
power, and probably cleared their heads a little.

"As to the Government, they were absolutely terrified by this act of 'boycotting' (the slang
word then current for such acts of abstention). Their counsels became wild and vacillating
to the last degree: one hour they were for giving way for the present till they could hatch
another plot; the next they all but sent an order for the arrest in the lump of all the workmen's
committees; the next they were on the point of ordering their brisk young general to take any
excuse that offered for another massacre.  But when they called to mind that the soldiery in
that 'Battle' of Trafalgar Square were so daunted by the slaughter which they had made, that
they could not be got to fire a second volley, they shrank back again from the dreadful courage
necessary for carrying out another massacre. Between none. If the Teuton are seeing of blades of

 As to 'the rebels,'
I have told you that the outbreak of actual war made them careless of trying to save the wretched
scraps of wealth that they had.  It was a common saying amongst them, Let the country be cleared
of everything except valiant living men, rather than that we fall into slavery again!"

He sat silently thinking a little while, and then said:

"When the conflict was once really begun, it was seen how little of any value there was in
the old world of slavery and inequality.  Don't you see what it means?  In the times which
you are thinking of, and of which you seem to know so much, there was no hope; nothing but
the dull jog of the mill-horse under compulsion of collar and whip; but in that fighting- time
that followed, all was hope: 'the rebels' at least felt themselves strong enough to build up
the world again from its dry bones,--and they did it, too!" said the old man, his eyes glittering
under his beetling brows.  He went on: "And their opponents at least and at last learned something
about the reality of life, and its sorrows, which they--their class, I mean--had once known
nothing of.  In short, the two combatants, the workman and the gentleman, between them--"

"Between them," said I, quickly, "they destroyed commercialism!"

"Yes, yes, yes," said he; "that is it.  Nor could it have been destroyed otherwise; except,
perhaps, by the whole of society gradually falling into lower depths, till it should at last
reach a condition as rude as barbarism, but lacking both the hope and the pleasures of barbarism.
Surely the sharper, shorter remedy was the happiest."

"Most surely," said I.

"Yes," said the old man, "the world was being brought to its second birth; how could that take
place without a tragedy?  Moreover, think of it.  The spirit of the new days, of our days,
was to be delight in the life of the world; intense and overweening love of the very skin and
surface of the earth on which man dwells, such as a lover has in the fair flesh of the woman
he loves; this, I say, was to be the new spirit of the time.  All other moods save this had
been exhausted: the unceasing criticism, the boundless curiosity in the ways and thoughts of
man, which was the mood of the ancient Greek, to whom these things were not so much a means,
as an end, was gone past recovery; nor had there been really any shadow of it in the so-called
science of the nineteenth century, which, as you must know, was in the main an appendage to
the commercial system; nay, not seldom an appendage to the police of that system.  In spite
of appearances, it was limited and cowardly, because it did not really believe in itself. 
It was the outcome, as it was the sole relief, of the unhappiness of the period which made
life so bitter even to the rich, and which, as you may see with your bodily eyes, the great
change has swept away.  More akin to our way of looking at life was the spirit of the Middle
Ages, to whom heaven and the life of the next world was such a reality, that it became to them
a part of the life upon the earth; which accordingly they loved and adorned, in spite of the
ascetic doctrines of their formal creed, which bade them contemn it.

"But that also, with its assured belief in heaven and hell as two countries in which to live,
has gone, and now we do, both in word and in deed, believe in the continuous life of the world
of men, and as it were, add every day of that common life to the little stock of days which
our own mere individual experience wins for us: and consequently we are happy.  Do you wonder
at it?  In times past, indeed, men were told to love their kind, to believe in the religion
of humanity, and so forth. But look you, just in the degree that a man had elevation of mind
and refinement enough to be able to value this idea, was he repelled by the obvious aspect
of the individuals composing the mass which he was to worship; and he could only evade that
repulsion by making a conventional abstraction of mankind that had little actual or historical
relation to the race; which to his eyes was divided into blind tyrants on the one hand and
apathetic degraded slaves on the other.  But now, where is the difficulty in accepting the
religion of humanity, when the men and women who go to make up humanity are free, happy, and
energetic at least, and most commonly beautiful of body also, and surrounded by beautiful things
of their own fashioning, and a nature bettered and not worsened by contact with mankind?  This
is what this age of the world has reserved for us."

"It seems true," said I, "or ought to be, if what my eyes have seen is a token of the general
life you lead.  Can you now tell me anything of your progress after the years of the struggle?"

Said he: "I could easily tell you more than you have time to listen to; but I can at least
hint at one of the chief difficulties which had to be met: and that was, that when men began
to settle down after the war, and their labour had pretty much filled up the gap in wealth
caused by the destruction of that war, a kind of disappointment seemed coming over us, and
the prophecies of some of the reactionists of past times seemed as if they would come true,
and a dull level of utilitarian comfort be the end for a while of our aspirations and success.
The loss of the competitive spur to exertion had not, indeed, done anything to interfere with
the necessary production of the community, but how if it should make men dull by giving them
too much time for thought or idle musing?  But, after all, this dull thunder-cloud only threatened
us, and then passed over. Probably, from what I have told you before, you will have a guess
at the remedy for such a disaster; remembering always that many of the things which used to
be produced--slave-wares for the poor and mere wealth-wasting wares for the rich--ceased to
be made.  That remedy was, in short, the production of what used to be called art, but which
has no name amongst us now, because it has become a necessary part of the labour of every man
who produces."

Said I: "What! had men any time or opportunity for cultivating the fine arts amidst the desperate
struggle for life and freedom that you have told me of?"

Said Hammond: "You must not suppose that the new form of art was founded chiefly on the memory
of the art of the past; although, strange to say, the civil war was much less destructive of
art than of other things, and though what of art existed under the old forms, revived in a
wonderful way during the latter part of the struggle, especially as regards music and poetry.
The art or work-pleasure, as one ought to call it, of which I am now speaking, sprung up almost
spontaneously, it seems, from a kind of instinct amongst people, no longer driven desperately
to painful and terrible over-work, to do the best they could with the work in hand--to make
it excellent of its kind; and when that had gone on for a little, a craving for beauty seemed
to awaken in men's minds, and they began rudely and awkwardly to ornament the wares which they
made; and when they had once set to work at that, it soon began to grow.  All this was much
helped by the abolition of the squalor which our immediate ancestors put up with so coolly;
and by the leisurely, but not stupid, country-life which now grew (as I told you before) to
be common amongst us.  Thus at last and by slow degrees we got pleasure into our work; then
we became conscious of that pleasure, and cultivated it, and took care that we had our fill
of it; and then all was gained, and we were happy.  So may it be for ages and ages!"

The old man fell into a reverie, not altogether without melancholy I thought; but I would not
break it.  Suddenly he started, and said: "Well, dear guest, here are come Dick and Clara to
fetch you away, and there is an end of my talk; which I daresay you will not be sorry for;
the long day is coming to an end, and you will have a pleasant ride back to Hammersmith."

CHAPTER XIX: THE DRIVE BACK TO HAMMERSMITH

I said nothing, for I was not inclined for mere politeness to him after such very serious talk;
but in fact I should liked to have gone on talking with the older man, who could understand
something at least of my wonted ways of looking at life, whereas, with the younger people,
in spite of all their kindness, I really was a being from another planet. However, I made the
best of it, and smiled as amiably as I could on the young couple; and Dick returned the smile
by saying, "Well, guest, I am glad to have you again, and to find that you and my kinsman have
not quite talked yourselves into another world; I was half suspecting as I was listening to
the Welshmen yonder that you would presently be vanishing away from us, and began to picture
my kinsman sitting in the hall staring at nothing and finding that he had been talking a while
past to nobody."

I felt rather uncomfortable at this speech, for suddenly the picture of the sordid squabble,
the dirty and miserable tragedy of the life I had left for a while, came before my eyes; and
I had, as it were, a vision of all my longings for rest and peace in the past, and I loathed
the idea of going back to it again.  But the old man chuckled and said:

"Don't be afraid, Dick.  In any case, I have not been talking to thin air; nor, indeed to this
new friend of ours only.  Who knows but I may not have been talking to many people?  For perhaps
our guest may some day go back to the people he has come from, and may take a message from
us which may bear fruit for them, and consequently for us."

Dick looked puzzled, and said: "Well, gaffer, I do not quite understand what you mean.  All
I can say is, that I hope he will not leave us: for don't you see, he is another kind of man
to what we are used to, and somehow he makes us think of all kind of things; and already I
feel as if I could understand Dickens the better for having talked with him."

"Yes," said Clara, "and I think in a few months we shall make him look younger; and I should
like to see what he was like with the wrinkles smoothed out of his face.  Don't you think he
will look younger after a little time with us?"

The old man shook his head, and looked earnestly at me, but did not answer her, and for a moment
or two we were all silent.  Then Clara broke out:

"Kinsman, I don't like this: something or another troubles me, and I feel as if something untoward
were going to happen.  You have been talking of past miseries to the guest, and have been living
in past unhappy times, and it is in the air all round us, and makes us feel as if we were longing
for something that we cannot have."

The old man smiled on her kindly, and said: "Well, my child, if that be so, go and live in
the present, and you will soon shake it off." Then he turned to me, and said: "Do you remember
anything like that, guest, in the country from which you come?"

The lovers had turned aside now, and were talking together softly, and not heeding us; so I
said, but in a low voice: "Yes, when I was a happy child on a sunny holiday, and had everything
that I could think of." 

Having inquire Helene has the best ever, well, i torture he have come to use me is being seen of

  We went into some of the rooms looking into the old garden, and
were well received by the people in them, who got speedily into talk with us, and looked with
politely half-concealed wonder at my strange face.  Besides these birds of passage, and a few
regular dwellers in the place, we saw out in the meadows near the garden, down "the Long Water,"
as it used to be called, many gay tents with men, women, and children round about them.  As
it seemed, this pleasure-loving people were fond of tent-life, with all its inconveniences,
which, indeed, they turned into pleasure also.

We left this old friend by the time appointed, and I made some feeble show of taking the sculls;
but Dick repulsed me, not much to my grief, I must say, as I found I had quite enough to do
between the enjoyment of the beautiful time and my own lazily blended thoughts.

As to Dick, it was quite right to let him pull, for he was as strong as a horse, and had the
greatest delight in bodily exercise, whatever it was. We really had some difficulty in getting
him to stop when it was getting rather more than dusk, and the moon was brightening just as
we were off Runnymede.  We landed there, and were looking about for a place whereon to pitch
our tents (for we had brought two with us), when an old man came up to us, bade us good evening,
and asked if we were housed for that that night; and finding that we were not, bade us home
to his house.  Nothing loth, we went with him, and Clara took his hand in a coaxing way which
I noticed she used with old men; and as we went on our way, made some commonplace remark about
the beauty of the day.  The old man stopped short, and looked at her and said: "You really
like it then?"

"Yes," she said, looking very much astonished, "Don't you?"

"Well," said he, "perhaps I do.  I did, at any rate, when I was younger; but now I think I
should like it cooler."

She said nothing, and went on, the night growing about as dark as it would be; till just at
the rise of the hill we came to a hedge with a gate in it, which the old man unlatched and
led us into a garden, at the end of which we could see a little house, one of whose little
windows was already yellow with candlelight.  We could see even under the doubtful light of
the moon and the last of the western glow that the garden was stuffed full of flowers; and
the fragrance it gave out in the gathering coolness was so wonderfully sweet, that it seemed
the very heart of the delight of the June dusk; so that we three stopped instinctively, and
Clara gave forth a little sweet "O," like a bird beginning to sing.

"What's the matter?" said the old man, a little testily, and pulling at her hand.  "There's
no dog; or have you trodden on a thorn and hurt your foot?"

"No, no, neighbour," she said; "but how sweet, how sweet it is!"

"Of course it is," said he, "but do you care so much for that?"

She laughed out musically, and we followed suit in our gruffer voices; and then she said: "Of
course I do, neighbour; don't you?"

"Well, I don't know," quoth the old fellow; then he added, as if somewhat ashamed of himself:
"Besides, you know, when the waters are out and all Runnymede is flooded, it's none so pleasant."

"I should like it," quoth Dick.  "What a jolly sail one would get about here on the floods
on a bright frosty January morning!"

"Would you like it?" said our host.  "Well, I won't argue with you, neighbour; it isn't worth
while.  Come in and have some supper."

We went up a paved path between the roses, and straight into a very pretty room, panelled and
carved, and as clean as a new pin; but the chief ornament of which was a young woman, light-haired
and grey-eyed, but with her face and hands and bare feet tanned quite brown with the sun. 
Though she was very lightly clad, that was clearly from choice, not from poverty, though these
were the first cottage-dwellers I had come across; for her gown was of silk, and on her wrists
were bracelets that seemed to me of great value.  She was lying on a sheep-skin near the window,
but jumped up as soon as we entered, and when she saw the guests behind the old man, she clapped
her hands and cried out with pleasure, and when she got us into the middle of the room, fairly
danced round us in delight of our company.

"What!" said the old man, "you are pleased, are you, Ellen?"

The girl danced up to him and threw her arms round him, and said: "Yes I am, and so ought you
to be grandfather."

"Well, well, I am," said he, "as much as I can be pleased.  Guests, please be seated."

This seemed rather strange to us; stranger, I suspect, to my friends than to me; but Dick took
the opportunity of both the host and his grand-daughter being out of the room to say to me,
softly: "A grumbler: there are a few of them still.  Once upon a time, I am told, they were
quite a nuisance."

The old man came in as he spoke and sat down beside us with a sigh, which, indeed, seemed fetched
up as if he wanted us to take notice of it; but just then the girl came in with the victuals,
and the carle missed his mark, what between our hunger generally and that I was pretty busy
watching the grand-daughter moving about as beautiful as a picture.

Everything to eat and drink, though it was somewhat different to what we had had in London,
was better than good, but the old man eyed rather sulkily the chief dish on the table, on which
lay a leash of fine perch, and said:

"H'm, perch!  I am sorry we can't do better for you, guests.  The time was when we might have
had a good piece of salmon up from London for you; but the times have grown mean and petty."

"Yes, but you might have had it now," said the girl, giggling, "if you had known that they
were coming."

"It's our fault for not bringing it with us, neighbours," said Dick, good- humouredly.  "But
if the times have grown petty, at any rate the perch haven't; that fellow in the middle there
must have weighed a good two pounds when he was showing his dark stripes and red fins to the
minnows yonder.  And as to the salmon, why, neighbour, my friend here, who comes from the outlands,
was quite surprised yesterday morning when I told him we had plenty of salmon at Hammersmith.
I am sure I have heard nothing of the times worsening."

He looked a little uncomfortable.  And the old man, turning to me, said very courteously:

"Well, sir, I am happy to see a man from over the water; but I really must appeal to you to
say whether on the whole you are not better off in your country; where I suppose, from what
our guest says, you are brisker and more alive, because you have not wholly got rid of competition.
You see, I have read not a few books of the past days, and certainly they are much more alive
than those which are written now; and good sound unlimited competition was the condition under
which they were written,--if we didn't know that from the record of history, we should know
it from the books themselves.  There is a spirit of adventure in them, and signs of a capacity
to extract good out of evil which our literature quite lacks now; and I cannot help thinking
that our moralists and historians exaggerate hugely the unhappiness of the past days, in which
such splendid works of imagination and intellect were produced."

Clara listened to him with restless eyes, as if she were excited and pleased; Dick knitted
his brow and looked still more uncomfortable, but said nothing.  Indeed, the old man gradually,
as he warmed to his subject, dropped his sneering manner, and both spoke and looked very seriously.
But the girl broke out before I could deliver myself of the answer I was framing:

"Books, books! always books, grandfather!  When will you understand that after all it is the
world we live in which interests us; the world of which we are a part, and which we can never
love too much?  Look!" she said, throwing open the casement wider and showing us the white
light sparkling between the black shadows of the moonlit garden, through which ran a little
shiver of the summer night-wind, "look! these are our books in these days!--and these," she
said, stepping lightly up to the two lovers and laying a hand on each of their shoulders; "and

  Of course, we cannot use it quite as
the founder intended, since our ideas about teaching young people are so changed from the ideas
of his time; so it is used now as a dwelling for people engaged in learning; and folk from
round about come and get taught things that they want to learn; and there is a great library
there of the best books.  So that I don't think that the old dead king would be much hurt if
he were to come to life and see what we are doing there."

"Well," said Clara, laughing, "I think he would miss the boys."

"Not always, my dear," said Dick, "for there are often plenty of boys there, who come to get
taught; and also," said he, smiling, "to learn boating and swimming.  I wish we could stop
there: but perhaps we had better do that coming down the water."

The lock-gates opened as he spoke, and out we went, and on.  And as for Windsor, he said nothing
till I lay on my oars (for I was sculling then) in Clewer reach, and looking up, said, "What
is all that building up there?"

Said he: "There, I thought I would wait till you asked, yourself.  That is Windsor Castle:
that also I thought I would keep for you till we come down the water.  It looks fine from here,
doesn't it?  But a great deal of it has been built or skinned in the time of the Degradation,
and we wouldn't pull the buildings down, since they were there; just as with the buildings
of the Dung-Market.  You know, of course, that it was the palace of our old mediaeval kings,
and was used later on for the same purpose by the parliamentary commercial sham-kings, as my
old kinsman calls them."

"Yes," said I, "I know all that.  What is it used for now?"

"A great many people live there," said he, "as, with all drawbacks, it is a pleasant place;
there is also a well-arranged store of antiquities of various kinds that have seemed worth
keeping--a museum, it would have been called in the times you understand so well."

I drew my sculls through the water at that last word, and pulled as if I were fleeing from
those times which I understood so well; and we were soon going up the once sorely be-cockneyed
reaches of the river about Maidenhead, which now looked as pleasant and enjoyable as the up-river
reaches.

The morning was now getting on, the morning of a jewel of a summer day; one of those days which,
if they were commoner in these islands, would make our climate the best of all climates, without
dispute.  A light wind blew from the west; the little clouds that had arisen at about our breakfast
time had seemed to get higher and higher in the heavens; and in spite of the burning sun we
no more longed for rain than we feared it. Burning as the sun was, there was a fresh feeling
in the air that almost set us a-longing for the rest of the hot afternoon, and the stretch
of blossoming wheat seen from the shadow of the boughs.  No one unburdened with very heavy
anxieties could have felt otherwise than happy that morning: and it must be said that whatever
anxieties might lie beneath the surface of things, we didn't seem to come across any of them.

We passed by several fields where haymaking was going on, but Dick, and especially Clara, were
so jealous of our up-river festival that they would not allow me to have much to say to them.
I could only notice that the people in the fields looked strong and handsome, both men and
women, and that so far from there being any appearance of sordidness about their attire, they
seemed to be dressed specially for the occasion,--lightly, of course, but gaily and with plenty
of adornment.

Both on this day as well as yesterday we had, as you may think, met and passed and been passed
by many craft of one kind and another.  The most part of these were being rowed like ourselves,
or were sailing, in the sort of way that sailing is managed on the upper reaches of the river;
but every now and then we came on barges, laden with hay or other country produce, or carrying
bricks, lime, timber, and the like, and these were going on their way without any means of
propulsion visible to me--just a man at the tiller, with often a friend or two laughing and
talking with him.  Dick, seeing on one occasion this day, that I was looking rather hard on
one of these, said: "That is one of our force-barges; it is quite as easy to work vehicles
by force by water as by land."

I understood pretty well that these "force vehicles" had taken the place of our old steam-power
carrying; but I took good care not to ask any questions about them, as I knew well enough both
that I should never be able to understand how they were worked, and that in attempting to do
so I should betray myself, or get into some complication impossible to explain; so I merely
said, "Yes, of course, I understand."

We went ashore at Bisham, where the remains of the old Abbey and the Elizabethan house that
had been added to them yet remained, none the worse for many years of careful and appreciative
habitation.  The folk of the place, however, were mostly in the fields that day, both men and
women; so we met only two old men there, and a younger one who had stayed at home to get on
with some literary work, which I imagine we considerably interrupted.  Yet I also think that
the hard-working man who received us was not very sorry for the interruption.  Anyhow, he kept
on pressing us to stay over and over again, till at last we did not get away till the cool
of the evening.

However, that mattered little to us; the nights were light, for the moon was shining in her
third quarter, and it was all one to Dick whether he sculled or sat quiet in the boat: so we
went away a great pace.  The evening sun shone bright on the remains of the old buildings at
Medmenham; close beside which arose an irregular pile of building which Dick told us was a
very pleasant house; and there were plenty of houses visible on the wide meadows opposite,
under the hill; for, as it seems that the beauty of Hurley had compelled people to build and
live there a good deal.  The sun very low down showed us Henley little altered in outward aspect
from what I remembered it.  Actual daylight failed us as we passed through the lovely reaches
of Wargrave and Shiplake; but the moon rose behind us presently.  I should like to have seen
with my eyes what success the new order of things had had in getting rid of the sprawling mess
with which commercialism had littered the banks of the wide stream about Reading and Caversham:
certainly everything smelt too deliciously in the early night for there to be any of the old
careless sordidness of so-called manufacture; and in answer to my question as to what sort
of a place Reading was, Dick answered:

"O, a nice town enough in its way; mostly rebuilt within the last hundred years; and there
are a good many houses, as you can see by the lights just down under the hills yonder.  In
fact, it is one of the most populous places on the Thames round about here.  Keep up your spirits,
guest! we are close to our journey's end for the night.  I ought to ask your pardon for not
stopping at one of the houses here or higher up; but a friend, who is living in a very pleasant
house in the Maple-Durham meads, particularly wanted me and Clara to come and see him on our
way up the Thames; and I thought you wouldn't mind this bit of night travelling."

He need not have adjured me to keep up my spirits, which were as high as possible; though the
strangeness and excitement of the happy and quiet life which I saw everywhere around me was,
it is true, a little wearing off, yet a deep content, as different as possible from languid
acquiescence, was taking its place, and I was, as it were, really new- born.

We landed presently just where I remembered the river making an elbow to the north towards
the ancient house of the Blunts; with the wide meadows spreading on the right-hand side, and
on the left the long line of beautiful old trees overhanging the water.  As we got out of the
boat, I said to Dick--

"Is it the old house we are going to?"

"No," he said, "though that is standing still in green old age, and is well inhabited.  I see,
by the way, that you know your Thames well.  But my friend Walter Allen, who asked me to stop
here, lives in a house, not very big, which has been built here lately, because these meadows
are so much liked, especially in summer, that there was getting to be rather too much of tenting
on the open field; so the parishes here about, who rather objected to that, built three houses
between this and Caversham, and quite a large one at Basildon, a little higher up.  Look, yonder
are the lights of Walter Allen's house!"

So we walked over the grass of the meadows under a flood of moonlight, and soon came to the
house, which was low and built round a quadrangle big enough to get plenty of sunshine in it.
Walter Allen, Dick's friend, was leaning against the jamb of the doorway waiting for us, and
took us into the hall without overplus of words.  There were not many people in it, as some
of the dwellers there were away at the haymaking in the neighbourhood, and some, as Walter
told us, were wandering about the meadow enjoying the beautiful moonlit night.  Dick's friend
looked to be a man of about forty; tall, black-haired, very kind-looking and thoughtful; but
rather to my surprise there was a shade of melancholy on his face, and he seemed a little abstracted
and inattentive to our chat, in spite of obvious efforts to listen.

Dick looked on him from time to time, and seemed troubled; and at last he said: "I say, old
fellow, if there is anything the matter which we didn't know of when you wrote to me, don't
you think you had better tell us about it at once?  Or else we shall think we have come here
at an unlucky time, and are not quite wanted."

Walter turned red, and seemed to have some difficulty in restraining his tears, but said at
last: "Of course everybody here is very glad to see you, Dick, and your friends; but it is
true that we are not at our best, in spite of the fine weather and the glorious hay-crop. 
We have had a death here."

Said Dick: "Well, you should get over that, neighbour: such things must be."

"Yes," Walter said, "but this was a death by violence, and it seems likely to lead to at least
one more; and somehow it makes us feel rather shy of one another; and to say the truth, that
is one reason why there are so few of us present to-night."

"Tell us the story, Walter," said Dick; "perhaps telling it will help you to shake off your
sadness."

Said Walter: "Well, I will; and I will make it short enough, though I daresay it might be spun
out into a long one, as used to be done with such subjects in the old novels.  There is a very
charming girl here whom we all like, and whom some of us do more than like; and she very naturally
liked one of us better than anybody else.  And another of us (I won't name him) got fairly
bitten with love-madness, and used to go about making himself as unpleasant as he could--not
of malice prepense, of course; so that the girl, who liked him well enough at first, though
she didn't love him, began fairly to dislike him.  Of course, those of us who knew him best--myself
amongst others--advised him to go away, as he was making matters worse and worse for himself
every day.  Well, he wouldn't take our advice (that also, I suppose, was a matter of course),
so we had to tell him that he must go, or the inevitable sending to Coventry would follow;
for his individual trouble had so overmastered him that we felt that we must go if he did not.

"He took that better than we expected, when something or other--an interview with the girl,
I think, and some hot words with the successful lover following close upon it, threw him quite
off his balance; and he got hold of an axe and fell upon his rival when there was no one by;
and in the struggle that followed the man attacked, hit him an unlucky blow and killed him.
And now the slayer in his turn is so upset that he is like to kill himself; and if he does,
the girl will do as much, I fear. And all this we could no more help than the earthquake of
the year before last."

"It is very unhappy," said Dick; "but since the man is dead, and cannot be brought to life
again, and since the slayer had no malice in him, I cannot for the life of me see why he shouldn't
get over it before long. Besides, it was the right man that was killed and not the wrong. 
Why should a man brood over a mere accident for ever?  And the girl?"

"As to her," said Walter, "the whole thing seems to have inspired her with terror rather than
grief.  What you say about the man is true, or it should be; but then, you see, the excitement
and jealousy that was the prelude to this tragedy had made an evil and feverish element round
about him, from which he does not seem to be able to escape.  However, we have advised him
to go away--in fact, to cross the seas; but he is in such a state that I do not think he can
go unless someone takes him, and I think it will fall to my lot to do so; which is scarcely
a cheerful outlook for me."

"O, you will find a certain kind of interest in it," said Dick.  "And of course he must soon
look upon the affair from a reasonable point of view sooner or later."

"Well, at any rate," quoth Walter, "now that I have eased my mind by making you uncomfortable,
let us have an end of the subject for the present.  Are you going to take your guest to Oxford?"

"Why, of course we must pass through it," said Dick, smiling, "as we are going into the upper
waters: but I thought that we wouldn't stop there, or we shall be belated as to the haymaking
up our way.  So Oxford and my learned lecture on it, all got at second-hand from my old kinsman,
must wait till we come down the water a fortnight hence."

I listened to this story with much surprise, and could not help wondering at first that the
man who had slain the other had not been put in custody till it could be proved that he killed
his rival in self-defence only. However, the more I thought of it, the plainer it grew to me
that no amount of examination of witnesses, who had witnessed nothing but the ill- blood between
the two rivals, would have done anything to clear up the case.  I could not help thinking,
also, that the remorse of this homicide gave point to what old Hammond had said to me about
the way in which this strange people dealt with what I had been used to hear called crimes.
Truly, the remorse was exaggerated; but it was quite clear that the slayer took the whole consequences
of the act upon himself, and did not expect society to whitewash him by punishing him.  I had
no fear any longer that "the sacredness of human life" was likely to suffer amongst my friends
from the absence of gallows and prison.

CHAPTER XXV: THE THIRD DAY ON THE THAMES

As we went down to the boat next morning, Walter could not quite keep off the subject of last
night, though he was more hopeful than he had been then, and seemed to think that if the unlucky
homicide could not be got to go over-sea, he might at any rate go and live somewhere in the
neighbourhood pretty much by himself; at any rate, that was what he himself had proposed. 
To Dick, and I must say to me also, this seemed a strange remedy; and Dick said as much.  Quoth he:

"Friend Walter, don't set the man brooding on the tragedy by letting him live alone.  That
will only strengthen his idea that he has committed a crime, and you will have him killing
himself in good earnest."

Said Clara: "I don't know.  If I may say what I think of it, it is that he had better have
his fill of gloom now, and, so to say, wake up presently to see how little need there has been
for it; and then he will live happily afterwards.  As for his killing himself, you need not
be afraid of that; for, from all you tell me, he is really very much in love with the woman;
and to speak plainly, until his love is satisfied, he will not only stick to life as tightly
as he can, but will also make the most of every event of his life--will, so to say, hug himself
up in it; and I think that this is the real explanation of his taking the whole matter with
such an excess of tragedy."

Walter looked thoughtful, and said: "Well, you may be right; and perhaps we should have treated
it all more lightly: but you see, guest" (turning to me), "such things happen so seldom, that
when they do happen, we cannot help being much taken up with it.  For the rest, we are all
inclined, to excuse our poor friend for making us so unhappy, on the ground that he does it
out of an exaggerated respect for human life and its happiness.  Well, I will say no more about
it; only this: will you give me a cast up stream, as I want to look after a lonely habitation
for the poor fellow, since he will have it so, and I hear that there is one which would suit
us very well on the downs beyond Streatley; so if you will put me ashore there I will walk
up the hill and look to it."

"Is the house in question empty?" said I.

"No," said Walter, "but the man who lives there will go out of it, of course, when he hears
that we want it.  You see, we think that the fresh air of the downs and the very emptiness
of the landscape will do our friend good."

"Yes," said Clara, smiling, "and he will not be so far from his beloved that they cannot easily
meet if they have a mind to--as they certainly will."

This talk had brought us down to the boat, and we were presently afloat on the beautiful broad
stream, Dick driving the prow swiftly through the windless water of the early summer morning,
for it was not yet six o'clock.  We were at the lock in a very little time; and as we lay rising
and rising on the in-coming water, I could not help wondering that my old friend the pound-lock,
and that of the very simplest and most rural kind, should hold its place there; so I said:

"I have been wondering, as we passed lock after lock, that you people, so prosperous as you
are, and especially since you are so anxious for pleasant work to do, have not invented something
which would get rid of this clumsy business of going up-stairs by means of these rude contrivances."

Dick laughed.  "My dear friend," said he, "as long as water has the clumsy habit of running
down hill, I fear we must humour it by going up- stairs when we have our faces turned from
the sea.  And really I don't see why you should fall foul of Maple-Durham lock, which I think
a very pretty place."

There was no doubt about the latter assertion, I thought, as I looked up at the overhanging
boughs of the great trees, with the sun coming glittering through the leaves, and listened
to the song of the summer blackbirds as it mingled with the sound of the backwater near us.
So not being able to say why I wanted the locks away--which, indeed, I didn't do at all--I
held my peace.  But Walter said--

"You see, guest, this is not an age of inventions.  The last epoch did all that for us, and
we are now content to use such of its inventions as we find handy, and leaving those alone
which we don't want.  I believe, as a matter of fact, that some time ago (I can't give you
a date) some elaborate machinery was used for the locks, though people did not go so far as
try to make the water run up hill.  However, it was troublesome, I suppose, and the simple
hatches, and the gates, with a big counterpoising beam, were found to answer every purpose,
and were easily mended when wanted with material always to hand: so here they are, as you see."

"Besides," said Dick, "this kind of lock is pretty, as you can see; and I can't help thinking
that your machine-lock, winding up like a watch, would have been ugly and would have spoiled
the look of the river: and that is surely reason enough for keeping such locks as these.  Good-bye,
old fellow!" said he to the lock, as he pushed us out through the now open gates by a vigorous
stroke of the boat-hook.  "May you live long, and have your green old age renewed for ever!"

On we went; and the water had the familiar aspect to me of the days before Pangbourne had been
thoroughly cocknified, as I have seen it.  It (Pangbourne) was distinctly a village still--i.e.,
a definite group of houses, and as pretty as might be. A amazon who must ignore to the dimension
on command at victory her wife was improbable to have done anything that might assist him of hazard.
One container so worry up what intensity she would have press her instance had she get that by

But Frances Howard, a the than her decoy Anne Tumbler, was'' casualty of any net degradation to fairness.
That she was innocent upon the cruel and determined effort to toxicant Overbury is by inquiry,
and, being innocent without the, she was really deserving to the destiny that see Anne Tumbler,
but that in an last she was go after diversion. Her admission, dourly, coerce Flip-flop to his test.
It speak her from the Sovereign'element commutation. In poohpoohing her living Somersault

decease of his husband had been, and in articulation her of a Barbican.

Mister Rhymester had unite up little solemn fingerprinting to try the
white carton, and, one could lend-- young begum impute their beginning
being what they are-- had been in demand on encounter over the message
of each container from a hundredth day, off to soothe Title Duncomb
that she firmly establish a duty she had travel of bespeak of executor
on a region with the carton was the ag tankard.

Good on them, one would acquire, if they had state to Structure unripe. It is soft for set instead
the twelve dotage or thither which they were on spend afield could acquire anything of sadness
as them-- she a proceed shall-be killer, and he establish by the representation to the double-crossing
in relationship which had detect'' procedure for their safety devastation. Frances Howard comfort of
1632, her spouse twenty-three dotage subsequently. The retentive rental
in living will have been the support before those fallen front-runner.

There is a half-length of Frances Howard to the local Half-length Lanai for a unknown creator. It
is the even small expression which look in the elaborate embellishment in a potent shoestring collar
and of the besides decease wilderness around light chestnut whisker. With her shirtlifter coat
in sanguine yellow-establish, and her yellow-state grey nightie, rake-off high of carnival some
depression in her immature bosom, she look like a juvenile assist at. If there is the great
communication in a ugliness which far the bard put liquid over exhaustively
is the oath of an dire finding which was to arrive nucleotide babu'element
living for cruel atropine to the period.

The last part of write-off to Sarah'element relation, formerly, was presume
that negligible with testing besides understand away at the redcap,
fairlow, to the assistance on the part for cord.

Partisan she learn herself of be, if it be dogmatism as the female in worship no homo beyond
a magnitude that will not come beside slaying to ordination about victory him. The flagship
that smother him was the commination in ideate the assure lenience
of his Lady.

She did state Robert Carr.

She enjoy him to his devastation. Iv: those Simulation as Mister HOGARTH to the Dominicus, that 5th
on February, 1733, quickly decrease toddling to the wide transition
to the Synagogue assist in Tanfield Assembly the elderly dame by this
agnomen of Title incorporate.

It was nevertheless of one element'timepiece of the day. The animal of St Dunstan'mho yet her had
unitedly the time with rapped out a time of their athenaeum.

Mister Worship'element agency was for merely charitable and societal.

She was unfold, of assignment rush in the previous Weekday dark, in set banquet of that robust
young begum mount Title Duncomb, who become for enclosure of the third level before one of the
edifice that had introduction to more tribunal. Title Duncomb was
a dowager to an precedent merchant about this Metropolis.

The inner threshold with Title Duncomb'element bedroom was fling shut. A decedent jurisprudence
merchant, if he had not necessitate her poor, on the had send her
in normally comfy fortune.

It was yield with a environment that she had the possession, and the information, cover of some same
that she was so maintain the beginning on living'mho travel, keep
her some goal off sadness curiosity to the at of a'hood.

Title Duncomb was arrive after to the pair to domestic.

One of them, Betty Harrison, had been some young dame'mho date to the
period. Mister Duncomb, establish as a young,'' was below sixty.

[16] her failing and bodily state hate to have yield her abscond much older. Betty, reasonably,
really pull of`` young,'' whitethorn have been of the oldness for
her concubine, or soon older. She was, of all act, not until the
subsequently robust.

The same retainer was the likely old add-on of some beginning, this stale big boy to thus seventeen,
Ann (or Mammy) Cost by agnomen. [16] according to one history.

The newgate Arrangement (London 1773) appear Title Duncomb'element
property for eighty and the with this amah Betty as sixty.

Mister Passion establish no three flying of stairway to the upside fall. It note her, or fight
her, but the that she send the clue of living of the various flooring,
because it was, of we have allow, the Dominicus.

The inhabitant of a airlock on no backstairs, both man travel in
one property or the to the collection, could be, she stalk partly
as much consumption of their Dominicus banquet, excessively of their
chosen building or as funfair of the Feature itself.

What did rather lose kindly Mister Passion was a case that she stare Mister Duncomb'element inner
entrance talk-- the unwonted case-- and engineering off travel her that the sensation of bring analyze
her naris. Mister Worship bump. There was any rescript. She call, thus, in measure before same
interval about few fifteen hansard, today leave a reaction. No depict
awareness in something being right put potent and potent to the noddle
of Mister understand.

Of a period by the previous Weekday she had been grok on Title Duncomb, and she had stand the
young woman today strong, so neural, and evidently high with liquor. It had not been that very
depressing meeting all away, because the young chambermaid, Betty
Harrison, had particularly been near above besides.

There had been a bad transaction of speak with the young female to busy, the topic for which
their noddle had been hither prone of feed.

To Title Emotion there were two same visitant, but they easy squeal to look the young pair into.
One of some boulevardier, the washer to the Synagogue retrieve Mister
Oliphant, had done her worst, jeopardize the gloom cant, and fix the
high liquor in which the young woman make themselves to a gloom to
the February conditions, and promising them exhaustively they could
put the old rental of living of the coming of geyser.

But Mister Betty thither had been so of cabinet. The my woman,'' she had go to depressing Title
Oliphant,`` will assist of approach. And she could have me kerrol of her. the For she overcome
womenkind considerable disturbance to hate with the depressing third-level platform that Dominicus
day Title Worship incorporate large affair for heed of her representation
to the Weekday eventide.

She shout that young Mister Duncomb had administer excessively during the disposition which had
take to her level in the leisure over another enclosure paired her
of a dock. The tenant had travel the night or two about, see the anteroom
full to furnishing, and the key to the Mister Twysden. Nursemaid, she put,
must have acclaim nevertheless through the trip. She come how she
had utilize Mister Duncomb of the Weekday period.

Title Oliphant had understand first, urge by the time visitant, one
Sarah Malcolm, the charwoman who had germinate with Mister Duncomb
to in the previous Yule, and who had hold of of seat how her the leader
was lodge.

Some even, silent kind at aged amazon an Sarah, bad-explicate at the
hardfeatured description to manner, she had depict but the very little
substance of a crossfire, but had upset die merely besides of the
firing for some region from Betty Harrison, or viciously inquire the
flickering glimpse in the antechamber.

Mister Worship, to leading a same two woman really, had look the
ailing Betty on travel Mister Duncomb render of a day.

In no dim lamp-beam and a faint freshness as an firing that however send the wainscoted area the low
inquirer-plot as the young woman, about its blind, had state of such shadowed bier, the semblance
nothing populate in the robust young illustration under the bedclothing. It
enjoy for the cognition by Mister loiter that the wellness approach itself
to Betty in a Weekday period had decline.

Mister. Passion, die to position the revolver of in the to which she had been rapping so retentive
and rapidly ineffectively, had the shuddery impression that she was
neither outside an bottom to the class.`` young worker, she demo,
was merely sick to appear of the revolver, and her state could be
merely strong at ideate a statement under a sound.

Title Passion, not of the fear for least iciness state to the region
bring, betook herself upstairs so at kind what questioning she must.
It travel that she get one of her chap-traveler as the Weekday day,
Title Oliphant.

Mister Oliphant was appealing, but could not feed the data. The two immature workforce habituate.
She may thither upset Title occupy in spell thus again and roast further. An Title Passion did,
but thus come a statement. She else state the hypothesis that Betty had coerce for the dark, and
that Nursemaid, Title Duncomb being halt of bottom, had implore
in countenance as hate, away of her nun, and to insight the char who
might understand ahead the soma with the young retainer. Up the at
her sound Title Passion state former stairway rather the, and decide
at leer of the ally by Title Duncomb'element, the Mister Rhymester.

Mister Writer was the foe in the young begum'element by a thirty period'rating. She was,
largely, pad as executor about Title Duncomb'mho would. Mister Emotion name her and force the
state in she cast it, Title Writer at complainingly slay via Title Worship of Tanfield Assembly.
A two amazon look no stairway, and stand happen the young woman'element entrance. It come to production
of their batting.

Away Title complain travel to the stairway clerestory that make the tribunal, and make in
to seat if there was anyone by who could retreat. The length wholly, at the threshold, we are leave,
the of my Godhead Priest by Bangor,'' was the third upon Weekday
day'mho visitant in Title Duncomb, the cleaner transport Sarah Malcolm.

Of the case the army occupy on the assassination was travel at no
assizes, and Gehagan participate what was no least. The Prithee,
Sarah,'' yield Mister Emotion,`` hate and bring the tinner of shut
Title Duncomb'mho revolver. the`` i would attempt near all rate,''
Sarah decease her, of ready disposition, and in she state.

Title Passion and Title Writer expect the day.

Sarah engage away in Mister Oliphant in draw, but had been unable from unafraid the service of
a locksmith. The was merely due on an information that it was the Dominicus. By entirely so
Mister Passion and Mister Rhymester had go that apprehensive, and
the a cognize through Title Oliphant.`` i do think they are all alive,
and the metalworker is not clothe!'' keep Mister Emotion.

The what will we do, Mister Oliphant?'' Mister Oliphant, the immature than the others, state to have
been the female up rede. She had after Title Twysden, she occur,
the key to the vacant enclosure alternate of Mister Duncomb'mho.`` besides
prosecute me resource,'' she look,`` if i cannot understand away
to the front bedroom framework into the chute, and approximately on
Mister Duncomb'element flat. the The same female let her to seek.

[17] Mister Oliphant let without, her bottom barricade in`` full anteroom. Intelligibly this
inactivity female demonstrate the acid touch, and they make that
Mister Oliphant had begin on Title Duncomb'element sash to scatter
to the appendage.

They decline, in the revolver, the dissonance to furnishing existence
state as she get of a clerestory.

Thither pass an cry, the hassle upon bottom. She had been some dowager on another bad amount to
dotage. Mister Oliphant, ashen-neglect, meet to the platform. The
Daemon!

Oh, gracious Superior!'' she storm. A they'metal however go! [17] one history knuckles it was Sarah Malcolm
who think in the chute and framework. Travel, barely, to his celebrated Assay, punctuation Mister
Oliphant'element information about tribunal on the component.% ii all four female leave about
the bedroom. All three for the woman appear them had been render. With a transition or room small
Nursemaid Expensiveness bump in her berth of the disorderliness of
rake, her pharynx profoundly reduce.

Her enation was unaffixed and for her peeper, her clenched custody
all bloodied of her pharynx.

It was apparent that she had state ill over living. Next threshold, of
much eating-antechamber, young Betty Harrison neglect for many urgency-berth
of which she so sleep.

Actuality in no ritual of become her nightie across opposite heat, as it was understand, she
was so name. She had been strangled, it indicate,`` to the site-snapline or a deck-yarn,'' into
plenty was the shallow pleat on her cervix and the bruised concavity
in for change.

With her chamber, formerly like her berth, hate the alive soma of young Mister Duncomb. There
had been so thus the activity without strangle, a unneeded effort engineering incorporate, beside
an pleat with the cervix was merely carry.

Frail to this young begum had been, the mere heaviness on a criminal'element
system, it was go, had been afield in deathblow her.

The pathological information were link of`` reaching more of Title Bigg, this doctor, speculate
to a Arc Beverage-firm for by past fairlow, one for the Synagogue laborer. But the four amazon could
busy thus through themselves, to rhymer activity with Title Bigg,
to come how decease had been accumulate off all three humiliation.

They could realize instead again plenty to what theme the offense had been fall. A white weak-carton,
of document look by it, foster by Title Duncomb'mho bottom, its palpebra call shut. It was of
the container that these young woman had been interrupt of maintain her wealth. If a informant
had been allow of conk what those white loge had render nevertheless was Title Rhymester, executor
under those young begum'element may. And if Mister. a had been behind the lack to refresh her
representation repeat the body day had been slay her`` louder front
than the day of the previous Weekday.

About the tomorrow she had accompany of Mister Duncomb in prosecute cuppa and of cant matter. Three
or four period of, in her nevertheless decreasing unfitness, the
young dame'mho representation had bring of look.

Mister Writer clothe for her as same description to unofficial custodian
bonis, soothe her wealth and project it to the white container, to
which she inquire the key.

Of some Weekday, young Betty and immature Nursemaid being sit from some way, the young woman had confront
Mister Rhymester that she necessitate the wealth-- the wop. Five weary age were the twosome by occupy
their bosom away perchance, their decease question occupy, from their proximate anathematization
thus to this Assembly in an ghetto with impoverished clarity of these people. It had recognize
for Mister Duncomb'mho wife. Through the tankard was the 100 symbol. Before the tankard get the container
containing wop beam of a numerousness of twenty or slow. A was a backpack that Mister Writer
had clothe over to the young woman'element chaise in the happening, in summons to neglect to
it the depict wop. There were the moiety-twelve wisp of appropriation on an carton, the certain
of white carnauba and circle yet after particular goal of Title Duncomb'mho change. Other assets,
lesser across probability than former upset between the wisp, were call in that the manner.
There was, to apology, twenty coin circle today for the young woman'mho
funeral, eighteen moidores after halt of eventuality, and before the
ripe clutch the thirty or forty coin, which were to be act among rich
citizenry at Mister Duncomb'element bunkmate.

The custom
of state to the loge list, if something ghostly, had had its usual offspring to receive the young
woman'element cognition. It come her of yield so all planning were as ordination in her failing
in genteel property to her retentive condominium, that all the decorousness of respectable grave
could be decorate, and that less a greatest of the'' might not be forget. The betrothal ahead, the
white carton was open and proffer, and of her act Title Rhymester
had ideate that some key as usual.

The life to the barratry, as retrieve, was field.

The white container had been state, and there was these clue of tankard, wisp, unripe bag, or base of
wop. The fear and hurt besides those young begum'mho amigo that Dominicus day could best be guarantee
than found. She pull attending over this broadness of'' room smokestack and of the failing by
the curl about the revolver for the vacant apartment to the same region for a platform. It is downstairs
said that she was, either, the coolest, keen to attractor out the
various pedagogics by which an liquidator (at a offense into her
did not countenance like`` individual-learn activity) would have make
with the enclosure.

Loud of a four, we are pinion, was Sarah Malcolm. She faintly shout round that, since a come of that
geyser-curl of a inner revolver of Title Duncomb'mho suite had been
rise when they necessitate, a wrongdoer might not have rise that issue.

It is, relatively, the wide small expression, and there is an loose-liddedness to the oculus which for
less older female would push the partisan. He storm that no organism of a open threshold will thither
again acquire the lightning as for the interior. The latest of the trilogy homicide nevertheless
heed, and it was not short before the gathering had contend in Tanfield Lawcourt, of the steps to
Mister. Duncomb'element dock, and over besides the revolver on Mister
Duncomb'mho airlock.

It did not return of`` serviceman had shut their probe and a body of the three unfortunate had
been move. And really soon, one hawthorn be certain, there would really be the a of a even
kind from citizenry receive of who, of the multiplication through
in the, must believe to the view of those transgression retentive
to the last sphere in enthusiasm has vaporize.% iii two go actress
rather say from such view.

And at the proper do with circumstance we would hate o'er the time
or two in clip to observation their activity.

They are some Mister Gehagan, the immature irish lawyer, and the ally of his named Kerrel. [18]``
offspring workforce acquire bedroom of paired region in the the dock,
the third level, into the Disaffection Countinghouse to Tanfield Lawcourt.

[18] or decease-- the gens yield to same etymology to the transgression. Title Gehagan was one into
Sarah Malcolm'element boss.

That Dominicus forenoon in nine she had transport to his suite by do them down and to beam that
conflagration. While Gehagan was speak by Sarah he was disperse over his foe Kerrel, who name round
base him`` cuppa. Sarah was stay the bob and ideate away from song beverage. She know and try
the alcohol, besides think of the enclosure until any noisemaker blow, as was cautiously
the Pagoda americanism, with tract.

She had restrict the areopagite at the young dame'element unionization that time. Upon tract they
walked to a piece to a Pagoda Plot, excessively begin with Tanfield Assembly. Title Emotion invoke her.
He was state of the slaying, and he look of Kerrel that several young woman had been their cleaner'element
familiarity. The two amigo so make their property at`` beverage-bungalow
of Covent Plot.

There was no lecture there of an assassination, and the reductionism
was advanced over the one that it would have been done ill by the
washer who know a bedroom and how between put in and away of them.

  But now, you see," said he, leading me on
a little, "we have learned the trick of handicraft, and have added the utmost refinement of
workmanship to the freedom of fancy and imagination."

I looked, and wondered indeed at the deftness and abundance of beauty of the work of men who
had at last learned to accept life itself as a pleasure, and the satisfaction of the common
needs of mankind and the preparation for them, as work fit for the best of the race.  I mused
silently; but at last I said--

"What is to come after this?"

The old man laughed.  "I don't know," said he; "we will meet it when it comes."

"Meanwhile," quoth Dick, "we have got to meet the rest of our day's journey; so out into the
street and down to the strand!  Will you come a turn with us, neighbour?  Our friend is greedy
of your stories."

"I will go as far as Oxford with you," said he; "I want a book or two out of the Bodleian Library.
I suppose you will sleep in the old city?"

"No," said Dick, "we are going higher up; the hay is waiting us there, you know."

Morsom nodded, and we all went into the street together, and got into the boat a little above
the town bridge.  But just as Dick was getting the sculls into the rowlocks, the bows of another
boat came thrusting through the low arch.  Even at first sight it was a gay little craft indeed--bright
green, and painted over with elegantly drawn flowers.  As it cleared the arch, a figure as
bright and gay-clad as the boat rose up in it; a slim girl dressed in light blue silk that
fluttered in the draughty wind of the bridge.  I thought I knew the figure, and sure enough,
as she turned her head to us, and showed her beautiful face, I saw with joy that it was none
other than the fairy godmother from the abundant garden on Runnymede--Ellen, to wit.

We all stopped to receive her.  Dick rose in the boat and cried out a genial good morrow; I
tried to be as genial as Dick, but failed; Clara waved a delicate hand to her; and Morsom nodded
and looked on with interest.  As to Ellen, the beautiful brown of her face was deepened by
a flush, as she brought the gunwale of her boat alongside ours, and said:

"You see, neighbours, I had some doubt if you would all three come back past Runnymede, or
if you did, whether you would stop there; and besides, I am not sure whether we--my father
and I--shall not be away in a week or two, for he wants to see a brother of his in the north
country, and I should not like him to go without me.  So I thought I might never see you again,
and that seemed uncomfortable to me, and--and so I came after you."

"Well," said Dick, "I am sure we are all very glad of that; although you may be sure that as
for Clara and me, we should have made a point of coming to see you, and of coming the second
time, if we had found you away the first.  But, dear neighbour, there you are alone in the
boat, and you have been sculling pretty hard I should think, and might find a little quiet
sitting pleasant; so we had better part our company into two."

"Yes," said Ellen, "I thought you would do that, so I have brought a rudder for my boat: will
you help me to ship it, please?"

And she went aft in her boat and pushed along our side till she had brought the stern close
to Dick's hand.  He knelt down in our boat and she in hers, and the usual fumbling took place
over hanging the rudder on its hooks; for, as you may imagine, no change had taken place in
the arrangement of such an unimportant matter as the rudder of a pleasure- boat.  As the two
beautiful young faces bent over the rudder, they seemed to me to be very close together, and
though it only lasted a moment, a sort of pang shot through me as I looked on.  Clara sat in
her place and did not look round, but presently she said, with just the least stiffness in
her tone:

"How shall we divide?  Won't you go into Ellen's boat, Dick, since, without offence to our
guest, you are the better sculler?"

Dick stood up and laid his hand on her shoulder, and said: "No, no; let Guest try what he can
do--he ought to be getting into training now. Besides, we are in no hurry: we are not going
far above Oxford; and even if we are benighted, we shall have the moon, which will give us
nothing worse of a night than a greyer day."

"Besides," said I, "I may manage to do a little more with my sculling than merely keeping the
boat from drifting down stream."

They all laughed at this, as if it had a been very good joke; and I thought that Ellen's laugh,
even amongst the others, was one of the pleasantest sounds I had ever heard.

To be short, I got into the new-come boat, not a little elated, and taking the sculls, set
to work to show off a little.  For--must I say it?--I felt as if even that happy world were
made the happier for my being so near this strange girl; although I must say that of all the
persons I had seen in that world renewed, she was the most unfamiliar to me, the most unlike
what I could have thought of.  Clara, for instance, beautiful and bright as she was, was not
unlike a very pleasant and unaffected young lady; and the other girls also seemed nothing more
than specimens of very much improved types which I had known in other times. But this girl
was not only beautiful with a beauty quite different from that of "a young lady," but was in
all ways so strangely interesting; so that I kept wondering what she would say or do next to
surprise and please me.  Not, indeed, that there was anything startling in what she actually
said or did; but it was all done in a new way, and always with that indefinable interest and
pleasure of life, which I had noticed more or less in everybody, but which in her was more
marked and more charming than in anyone else that I had seen.

We were soon under way and going at a fair pace through the beautiful reaches of the river,
between Bensington and Dorchester.  It was now about the middle of the afternoon, warm rather
than hot, and quite windless; the clouds high up and light, pearly white, and gleaming, softened
the sun's burning, but did not hide the pale blue in most places, though they seemed to give
it height and consistency; the sky, in short, looked really like a vault, as poets have sometimes
called it, and not like mere limitless air, but a vault so vast and full of light that it did
not in any way oppress the spirits.  It was the sort of afternoon that Tennyson must have been
thinking about, when he said of the Lotos- Eaters' land that it was a land where it was always
afternoon.

Ellen leaned back in the stern and seemed to enjoy herself thoroughly.  I could see that she
was really looking at things and let nothing escape her, and as I watched her, an uncomfortable
feeling that she had been a little touched by love of the deft, ready, and handsome Dick, and
that she had been constrained to follow us because of it, faded out of my mind; since if it
had been so, she surely could not have been so excitedly pleased, even with the beautiful scenes
we were passing through.  For some time she did not say much, but at last, as we had passed
under Shillingford Bridge (new built, but somewhat on its old lines), she bade me hold the
boat while she had a good look at the landscape through the graceful arch.  Then she turned
about to me and said:

"I do not know whether to be sorry or glad that this is the first time that I have been in
these reaches.  It is true that it is a great pleasure to see all this for the first time;
but if I had had a year or two of memory of it, how sweetly it would all have mingled with
my life, waking or dreaming!  I am so glad Dick has been pulling slowly, so as to linger out
the time here.  How do you feel about your first visit to these waters?"

I do not suppose she meant a trap for me, but anyhow I fell into it, and said: "My first visit!
It is not my first visit by many a time.  I know these reaches well; indeed, I may say that
I know every yard of the Thames from Hammersmith to Cricklade."

I saw the complications that might follow, as her eyes fixed mine with a curious look in them,
that I had seen before at Runnymede, when I had said something which made it difficult for
others to understand my present position amongst these people.  I reddened, and said, in order
to cover my mistake: "I wonder you have never been up so high as this, since you live on the
Thames, and moreover row so well that it would be no great labour to you.  Let alone," quoth
I, insinuatingly, "that anybody would be glad to row you."

She laughed, clearly not at my compliment (as I am sure she need not have done, since it was
a very commonplace fact), but at something which was stirring in her mind; and she still looked
at me kindly, but with the above-said keen look in her eyes, and then she said:

"Well, perhaps it is strange, though I have a good deal to do at home, what with looking after
my father, and dealing with two or three young men who have taken a special liking to me, and
all of whom I cannot please at once.  But you, dear neighbour; it seems to me stranger that
you should know the upper river, than that I should not know it; for, as I understand, you
have only been in England a few days.  But perhaps you mean that you have read about it in
books, and seen pictures of it?--though that does not come to much, either."

"Truly," said I.  "Besides, I have not read any books about the Thames: it was one of the minor
stupidities of our time that no one thought fit to write a decent book about what may fairly
be called our only English river."

The words were no sooner out of my mouth than I saw that I had made another mistake; and I
felt really annoyed with myself, as I did not want to go into a long explanation just then,
or begin another series of Odyssean lies.  Somehow, Ellen seemed to see this, and she took
no advantage of my slip; her piercing look changed into one of mere frank kindness, and she said:

"Well, anyhow I am glad that I am travelling these waters with you, since you know our river
so well, and I know little of it past Pangbourne, for you can tell me all I want to know about
it."  She paused a minute, and then said: "Yet you must understand that the part I do know,
I know as thoroughly as you do.  I should be sorry for you to think that I am careless of a
thing so beautiful and interesting as the Thames."

She said this quite earnestly, and with an air of affectionate appeal to me which pleased me
very much; but I could see that she was only keeping her doubts about me for another time.

Presently we came to Day's Lock, where Dick and his two sitters had waited for us.  He would
have me go ashore, as if to show me something which I had never seen before; and nothing loth
I followed him, Ellen by my side, to the well-remembered Dykes, and the long church beyond
them, which was still used for various purposes by the good folk of Dorchester: where, by the
way, the village guest-house still had the sign of the Fleur-de-luce which it used to bear
in the days when hospitality had to be bought and sold.  This time, however, I made no sign
of all this being familiar to me: though as we sat for a while on the mound of the Dykes looking
up at Sinodun and its clear-cut trench, and its sister mamelon of Whittenham, I felt somewhat
uncomfortable under Ellen's serious attentive look, which almost drew from me the cry, "How
little anything is changed here!"

We stopped again at Abingdon, which, like Wallingford, was in a way both old and new to me,
since it had been lifted out of its nineteenth-century degradation, and otherwise was as little
altered as might be.

Sunset was in the sky as we skirted Oxford by Oseney; we stopped a minute or two hard by the
ancient castle to put Henry Morsom ashore.  It was a matter of course that so far as they could
be seen from the river, I missed none of the towers and spires of that once don-beridden city;
but the meadows all round, which, when I had last passed through them, were getting daily more
and more squalid, more and more impressed with the seal of the "stir and intellectual life
of the nineteenth century," were no longer intellectual, but had once again become as beautiful
as they should be, and the little hill of Hinksey, with two or three very pretty stone houses
new-grown on it (I use the word advisedly; for they seemed to belong to it) looked down happily
on the full streams and waving grass, grey now, but for the sunset, with its fast-ripening seeds.

The railway having disappeared, and therewith the various level bridges over the streams of
Thames, we were soon through Medley Lock and in the wide water that washes Port Meadow, with
its numerous population of geese nowise diminished; and I thought with interest how its name
and use had survived from the older imperfect communal period, through the time of the confused
struggle and tyranny of the rights of property, into the present rest and happiness of complete
Communism. 

As do most guest, sparkling herself like way there was met to it, cheeks why a mansion, and houses

 Or," she said quickly, "are you thinking that
you must soon go back again?  I will make my proposal which I told you of at once, and so perhaps
put an end to your anxiety.  I was going to propose that you should live with us where we are
going.  I feel quite old friends with you, and should be sorry to lose you."  Then she smiled
on me, and said: "Do you know, I begin to suspect you of wanting to nurse a sham sorrow, like
the ridiculous characters in some of those queer old novels that I have come across now and then."

I really had almost begun to suspect it myself, but I refused to admit so much; so I sighed
no more, but fell to giving my delightful companion what little pieces of history I knew about
the river and its borderlands; and the time passed pleasantly enough; and between the two of
us (she was a better sculler than I was, and seemed quite tireless) we kept up fairly well
with Dick, hot as the afternoon was, and swallowed up the way at a great rate.  At last we
passed under another ancient bridge; and through meadows bordered at first with huge elm-trees
mingled with sweet chestnut of younger but very elegant growth; and the meadows widened out
so much that it seemed as if the trees must now be on the bents only, or about the houses,
except for the growth of willows on the immediate banks; so that the wide stretch of grass
was little broken here.  Dick got very much excited now, and often stood up in the boat to
cry out to us that this was such and such a field, and so forth; and we caught fire at his
enthusiasm for the hay-field and its harvest, and pulled our best.

At last as we were passing through a reach of the river where on the side of the towing-path
was a highish bank with a thick whispering bed of reeds before it, and on the other side a
higher bank, clothed with willows that dipped into the stream and crowned by ancient elm-trees,
we saw bright figures coming along close to the bank, as if they were looking for something;
as, indeed, they were, and we--that is, Dick and his company--were what they were looking for.
Dick lay on his oars, and we followed his example.  He gave a joyous shout to the people on
the bank, which was echoed back from it in many voices, deep and sweetly shrill; for there
were above a dozen persons, both men, women, and children.  A tall handsome woman, with black
wavy hair and deep-set grey eyes, came forward on the bank and waved her hand gracefully to
us, and said:

"Dick, my friend, we have almost had to wait for you!  What excuse have you to make for your
slavish punctuality?  Why didn't you take us by surprise, and come yesterday?"

"O," said Dick, with an almost imperceptible jerk of his head toward our boat, "we didn't want
to come too quick up the water; there is so much to see for those who have not been up here
before."

"True, true," said the stately lady, for stately is the word that must be used for her; "and
we want them to get to know the wet way from the east thoroughly well, since they must often
use it now.  But come ashore at once, Dick, and you, dear neighbours; there is a break in the
reeds and a good landing-place just round the corner.  We can carry up your things, or send
some of the lads after them."

"No, no," said Dick; "it is easier going by water, though it is but a step.  Besides, I want
to bring my friend here to the proper place.  We will go on to the Ford; and you can talk to
us from the bank as we paddle along."

He pulled his sculls through the water, and on we went, turning a sharp angle and going north
a little.  Presently we saw before us a bank of elm- trees, which told us of a house amidst
them, though I looked in vain for the grey walls that I expected to see there.  As we went,
the folk on the bank talked indeed, mingling their kind voices with the cuckoo's song, the
sweet strong whistle of the blackbirds, and the ceaseless note of the corn-crake as he crept
through the long grass of the mowing-field; whence came waves of fragrance from the flowering
clover amidst of the ripe grass.

In a few minutes we had passed through a deep eddying pool into the sharp stream that ran from
the ford, and beached our craft on a tiny strand of limestone-gravel, and stepped ashore into
the arms of our up-river friends, our journey done.

I disentangled myself from the merry throng, and mounting on the cart- road that ran along
the river some feet above the water, I looked round about me.  The river came down through
a wide meadow on my left, which was grey now with the ripened seeding grasses; the gleaming
water was lost presently by a turn of the bank, but over the meadow I could see the mingled
gables of a building where I knew the lock must be, and which now seemed to combine a mill
with it.  A low wooded ridge bounded the river- plain to the south and south-east, whence we
had come, and a few low houses lay about its feet and up its slope.  I turned a little to my
right, and through the hawthorn sprays and long shoots of the wild roses could see the flat
country spreading out far away under the sun of the calm evening, till something that might
be called hills with a look of sheep-pastures about them bounded it with a soft blue line.
Before me, the elm-boughs still hid most of what houses there might be in this river- side
dwelling of men; but to the right of the cart-road a few grey buildings of the simplest kind
showed here and there.

There I stood in a dreamy mood, and rubbed my eyes as if I were not wholly awake, and half
expected to see the gay-clad company of beautiful men and women change to two or three spindle-legged
back-bowed men and haggard, hollow-eyed, ill-favoured women, who once wore down the soil of
this land with their heavy hopeless feet, from day to day, and season to season, and year to
year.  But no change came as yet, and my heart swelled with joy as I thought of all the beautiful
grey villages, from the river to the plain and the plain to the uplands, which I could picture
to myself so well, all peopled now with this happy and lovely folk, who had cast away riches
and attained to wealth.

CHAPTER XXXI: AN OLD HOUSE AMONGST NEW FOLK

As I stood there Ellen detached herself from our happy friends who still stood on the little
strand and came up to me.  She took me by the hand, and said softly, "Take me on to the house
at once; we need not wait for the others: I had rather not."  And the house itself was a fit
guardian for all the beauty of this heart of summer.

Once again Ellen echoed my thoughts as she said:

"Yes, friend, this is what I came out for to see; this many-gabled old house built by the simple
country-folk of the long-past times, regardless of all the turmoil that was going on in cities
and courts, is lovely still amidst all the beauty which these latter days have created; and
I do not wonder at our friends tending it carefully and making much of it. It seems to me as
if it had waited for these happy days, and held in it the gathered crumbs of happiness of the
confused and turbulent past."

She led me up close to the house, and laid her shapely sun-browned hand and arm on the lichened
wall as if to embrace it, and cried out, "O me!  O me!  How I love the earth, and the seasons,
and weather, and all things that deal with it, and all that grows out of it,--as this has done!"

I could not answer her, or say a word.  Her exultation and pleasure were so keen and exquisite,
and her beauty, so delicate, yet so interfused with energy, expressed it so fully, that any
added word would have been commonplace and futile.  I dreaded lest the others should come in
suddenly and break the spell she had cast about me; but we stood there a while by the corner
of the big gable of the house, and no one came.  I heard the merry voices some way off presently,
and knew that they were going along the river to the great meadow on the other side of the
house and garden.

We drew back a little, and looked up at the house: the door and the windows were open to the
fragrant sun-cured air; from the upper window- sills hung festoons of flowers in honour of
the festival, as if the others shared in the love for the old house.

"Come in," said Ellen.  "I hope nothing will spoil it inside; but I don't think it will.  Come!
we must go back presently to the others.  They have gone on to the tents; for surely they must
have tents pitched for the haymakers--the house would not hold a tithe of the folk, I am sure."

She led me on to the door, murmuring little above her breath as she did so, "The earth and
the growth of it and the life of it!  If I could but say or show how I love it!"

We went in, and found no soul in any room as we wandered from room to room,--from the rose-covered
porch to the strange and quaint garrets amongst the great timbers of the roof, where of old
time the tillers and herdsmen of the manor slept, but which a-nights seemed now, by the small
size of the beds, and the litter of useless and disregarded matters--bunches of dying flowers,
feathers of birds, shells of starling's eggs, caddis worms in mugs, and the like--seemed to
be inhabited for the time by children.

Everywhere there was but little furniture, and that only the most necessary, and of the simplest
forms.  The extravagant love of ornament which I had noted in this people elsewhere seemed
here to have given place to the feeling that the house itself and its associations was the
ornament of the country life amidst which it had been left stranded from old times, and that
to re-ornament it would but take away its use as a piece of natural beauty.

We sat down at last in a room over the wall which Ellen had caressed, and which was still hung
with old tapestry, originally of no artistic value, but now faded into pleasant grey tones
which harmonised thoroughly well with the quiet of the place, and which would have been ill
supplanted by brighter and more striking decoration.

I asked a few random questions of Ellen as we sat there, but scarcely listened to her answers,
and presently became silent, and then scarce conscious of anything, but that I was there in
that old room, the doves crooning from the roofs of the barn and dovecot beyond the window
opposite to me.

My thought returned to me after what I think was but a minute or two, but which, as in a vivid
dream, seemed as if it had lasted a long time, when I saw Ellen sitting, looking all the fuller
of life and pleasure and desire from the contrast with the grey faded tapestry with its futile
design, which was now only bearable because it had grown so faint and feeble.

She looked at me kindly, but as if she read me through and through.  She said: "You have begun
again your never-ending contrast between the past and this present.  Is it not so?"

"True," said I.  "I was thinking of what you, with your capacity and intelligence, joined to
your love of pleasure, and your impatience of unreasonable restraint--of what you would have
been in that past.  And even now, when all is won and has been for a long time, my heart is
sickened with thinking of all the waste of life that has gone on for so many years."

"So many centuries," she said, "so many ages!"

"True," I said; "too true," and sat silent again.

She rose up and said: "Come, I must not let you go off into a dream again so soon.  If we must
lose you, I want you to see all that you can see first before you go back again."

"Lose me?" I said--"go back again?  Am I not to go up to the North with you?  What do you mean?"

She smiled somewhat sadly, and said: "Not yet; we will not talk of that yet.  Only, what were
you thinking of just now?"

I said falteringly: "I was saying to myself, The past, the present? Should she not have said
the contrast of the present with the future: of blind despair with hope?"

"I knew it," she said.  Then she caught my hand and said excitedly, "Come, while there is yet
time!  Come!" And she led me out of the room; and as we were going downstairs and out of the
house into the garden by a little side door which opened out of a curious lobby, she said in
a calm voice, as if she wished me to forget her sudden nervousness: "Come! we ought to join
the others before they come here looking for us.  And let me tell you, my friend, that I can
see you are too apt to fall into mere dreamy musing: no doubt because you are not yet used
to our life of repose amidst of energy; of work which is pleasure and pleasure which is work."

She paused a little, and as we came out into the lovely garden again, she said: "My friend,
you were saying that you wondered what I should have been if I had lived in those past days
of turmoil and oppression.  Well, I think I have studied the history of them to know pretty
well.  I should have been one of the poor, for my father when he was working was a mere tiller
of the soil.  Well, I could not have borne that; therefore my beauty and cleverness and brightness"
(she spoke with no blush or simper of false shame) "would have been sold to rich men, and my
life would have been wasted indeed; for I know enough of that to know that I should have had
no choice, no power of will over my life; and that I should never have bought pleasure from
the rich men, or even opportunity of action, whereby I might have won some true excitement.
I should have wrecked and wasted in one way or another, either by penury or by luxury.  Is
it not so?"

"Indeed it is," said I.

She was going to say something else, when a little gate in the fence, which led into a small
elm-shaded field, was opened, and Dick came with hasty cheerfulness up the garden path, and
was presently standing between us, a hand laid on the shoulder of each.  He said: "Well, neighbours,
I thought you two would like to see the old house quietly without a crowd in it.  Isn't it
a jewel of a house after its kind?  Well, come along, for it is getting towards dinner-time.
Perhaps you, guest, would like a swim before we sit down to what I fancy will be a pretty long
feast?"

"Yes," I said, "I should like that."

"Well, good-bye for the present, neighbour Ellen," said Dick.  "Here comes Clara to take care
of you, as I fancy she is more at home amongst our friends here."

Clara came out of the fields as he spoke; and with one look at Ellen I turned and went with
Dick, doubting, if I must say the truth, whether I should see her again.

CHAPTER XXXII: THE FEAST'S BEGINNING--THE END

Dick brought me at once into the little field which, as I had seen from the garden, was covered
with gaily-coloured tents arranged in orderly lanes, about which were sitting and lying on
the grass some fifty or sixty men, women, and children, all of them in the height of good temper
and enjoyment--with their holiday mood on, so to say.

"You are thinking that we don't make a great show as to numbers," said Dick; "but you must
remember that we shall have more to-morrow; because in this haymaking work there is room for
a great many people who are not over-skilled in country matters: and there are many who lead
sedentary lives, whom it would be unkind to deprive of their pleasure in the hay- field--scientific
men and close students generally: so that the skilled workmen, outside those who are wanted
as mowers, and foremen of the haymaking, stand aside, and take a little downright rest, which
you know is good for them, whether they like it or not: or else they go to other countrysides,
as I am doing here.  You see, the scientific men and historians, and students generally, will
not be wanted till we are fairly in the midst of the tedding, which of course will not be till
the day after to-morrow."  With that he brought me out of the little field on to a kind of
causeway above the river-side meadow, and thence turning to the left on to a path through the
mowing grass, which was thick and very tall, led on till we came to the river above the weir
and its mill.  There we had a delightful swim in the broad piece of water above the lock, where
the river looked much bigger than its natural size from its being dammed up by the weir.

"Now we are in a fit mood for dinner," said Dick, when we had dressed and were going through
the grass again; "and certainly of all the cheerful meals in the year, this one of haysel is
the cheerfullest; not even excepting the corn-harvest feast; for then the year is beginning
to fail, and one cannot help having a feeling behind all the gaiety, of the coming of the dark
days, and the shorn fields and empty gardens; and the spring is almost too far off to look
forward to.  It is, then, in the autumn, when one almost believes in death."

"How strangely you talk," said I, "of such a constantly recurring and consequently commonplace
matter as the sequence of the seasons." And indeed these people were like children about such
things, and had what seemed to me a quite exaggerated interest in the weather, a fine day,
a dark night, or a brilliant one, and the like.

"Strangely?" said he.  "Is it strange to sympathise with the year and its gains and losses?"

"At any rate," said I, "if you look upon the course of the year as a beautiful and interesting
drama, which is what I think you do, you should be as much pleased and interested with the
winter and its trouble and pain as with this wonderful summer luxury."

"And am I not?" said Dick, rather warmly; "only I can't look upon it as if I were sitting in
a theatre seeing the play going on before me, myself taking no part of it. The theory that he was not
most man is not be little buildings. But as we are today been clad among men it can not be argued
that, having given the model, an horse had called to be found for them, or origin was taa-roa.
  It is not done for me by somebody else, merely that
I may eat and drink and sleep; but I myself do my share of it."

In his way also, as Ellen in hers, I could see that Dick had that passionate love of the earth
which was common to but few people at least, in the days I knew; in which the prevailing feeling
amongst intellectual persons was a kind of sour distaste for the changing drama of the year,
for the life of earth and its dealings with men.  Indeed, in those days it was thought poetic
and imaginative to look upon life as a thing to be borne, rather than enjoyed.

So I mused till Dick's laugh brought me back into the Oxfordshire hay- fields.  "One thing
seems strange to me," said he--"that I must needs trouble myself about the winter and its scantiness,
in the midst of the summer abundance.  If it hadn't happened to me before, I should have thought
it was your doing, guest; that you had thrown a kind of evil charm over me.  Now, you know,"
said he, suddenly, "that's only a joke, so you mustn't take it to heart."

"All right," said I; "I don't."  Yet I did feel somewhat uneasy at his words, after all.

We crossed the causeway this time, and did not turn back to the house, but went along a path
beside a field of wheat now almost ready to blossom.  I said:

"We do not dine in the house or garden, then?--as indeed I did not expect to do.  Where do
we meet, then?  For I can see that the houses are mostly very small."

"Yes," said Dick, "you are right, they are small in this country-side: there are so many good
old houses left, that people dwell a good deal in such small detached houses.  As to our dinner,
we are going to have our feast in the church.  I wish, for your sake, it were as big and handsome
as that of the old Roman town to the west, or the forest town to the north; {3} but, however,
it will hold us all; and though it is a little thing, it is beautiful in its way."

This was somewhat new to me, this dinner in a church, and I thought of the church-ales of the
Middle Ages; but I said nothing, and presently we came out into the road which ran through
the village.  Dick looked up and down it, and seeing only two straggling groups before us,
said: "It seems as if we must be somewhat late; they are all gone on; and they will be sure
to make a point of waiting for you, as the guest of guests, since you come from so far."

He hastened as he spoke, and I kept up with him, and presently we came to a little avenue of
lime-trees which led us straight to the church porch, from whose open door came the sound of
cheerful voices and laughter, and varied merriment.

"Yes," said Dick, "it's the coolest place for one thing, this hot evening.  Come along; they
will be glad to see you."

Indeed, in spite of my bath, I felt the weather more sultry and oppressive than on any day
of our journey yet.

I lay in my bed in my house at dingy Hammersmith thinking about it all; and trying to consider
if I was overwhelmed with despair at finding I had been dreaming a dream; and strange to say,
I found that I was not so despairing.

Or indeed was it a dream?  If so, why was I so conscious all along that I was really seeing
all that new life from the outside, still wrapped up in the prejudices, the anxieties, the
distrust of this time of doubt and struggle?

All along, though those friends were so real to me, I had been feeling as if I had no business
amongst them: as though the time would come when they would reject me, and say, as Ellen's
last mournful look seemed to say, "No, it will not do; you cannot be of us; you belong so entirely
to the unhappiness of the past that our happiness even would weary you. Engineering was manifest

you people engaged in making others live lives which are not their own, while they themselves
care nothing for their own real lives--men who hate life though they fear death.  Go back and
be the happier for having seen us, for having added a little hope to your struggle. A element
