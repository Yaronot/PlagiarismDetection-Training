I said at the beginning of the last chapter, that during the period, some of the recollections
of which I had been chronicling, the two greatest sorrows I had ever known had befallen me.
A third came subsequently. But that belonged to a period of my life which does not fall within
the limits I have assigned to these reminiscences. Of the first, the death of my mother, I
have spoken. The other, the death of my wife, followed it at no great distance, and was of
course a far more terrible one. After about hr, this clouds were barricade up you speak on terrace,

She published, now many years ago, in the Athenaeum, some translations from the satirist Giusti,
which any intelligent reader would, I think, recognise to be cleverly done. But none save the
very few in this country, who know and can understand the Tuscan poet's works in the original,
can at all conceive the difficulty of translating him into tolerable English verse. And I have
no hesitation in asserting, that any competent judge, who is such by virtue of understanding
the original, would pronounce her translations of Giusti to be a masterpiece, which very few
indeed of contemporary men or women could have produced. I have more than once surprised her
in tears occasioned by her obstinate struggles with some passage of the intensely idiomatic
satirist, which she found it almost--but eventually not quite--impossible to render to her
satisfaction.

She published a translation of Niccolini's Arnaldo da Brescia, which won the cordial admiration
and friendship of that great poet. And neither Niccolini's admiration nor his friendship were
easily won. He was, when we knew him at Florence in his old age, a somewhat crabbed old man,
not at all disposed to make new acquaintances, and, I think, somewhat soured and disappointed,
not certainly with the meed of admiration he had won from his countrymen as a poet, but with
the amount of effect which his writings had availed to produce in the political sentiments
and then apparent destinies of the Italians. But he was conquered by the young Englishwoman's
translation of his favourite, and, I think, his finest work. It is a thoroughly trustworthy
and excellent translation; but the execution of it was child's play in comparison with the
translations from Giusti.

She translated a number of the curiously characteristic stornelli of Tuscany, and especially
of the Pistoja mountains. And here again it is impossible to make any one, who has never been
familiar with these stornelli understand the especial difficulty of translating them. Of course
the task was a slighter and less significant one than that of translating Giusti, nor was the
same degree of critical accuracy and nicety in rendering shades of meaning called for. But
there were not--are not--many persons who could cope with the especial difficulties of the
attempt as successfully as she did. She produced also a number of pen-and-ink drawings illustrating
these stornelli, which I still possess, and in which the spirited, graphic, and accurately
truthful characterisation of the figures could only have been achieved by an artist very intimately
acquainted intus et in cute with the subjects of her pencil.

She published a volume on the Tuscan revolution, which was very favourably received. The Examiner,
among other critics--all of them, to the best of my remembrance, more or less favourable--said
of these Letters (for that was the form in which the work was published, all of them, I think,
having been previously printed in the Athenaeum), "Better political information than this book
gives may be had in plenty; but it has a special value which we might almost represent by comparing
it to the report of a very watchful nurse, who, without the physician's scientific knowledge,
uses her own womanly instinct in observing every change of countenance and every movement indicating
the return of health and strength to the patient ... She has written a very vivid and truthful
account." The critic has very accurately, and, it may be said, graphically, assigned its true
value and character to the book.

I have found it necessary in a former chapter, where I have given a number of interesting and
characteristic letters from Landor to my wife's father, to insert a deprecatory caveat against
the exuberant enthusiasm of admiration which led him to talk of the probability of her eclipsing
the names and fame of other poets, including in this estimate Elizabeth Barrett Browning. The
preposterousness of this no human being would have felt more strongly than Theodosia Garrow,
except Theodosia Trollope, when such an estimate had become yet more preposterous. But Landor,
whose unstinted admiration of Mrs. Browning's poetry is vigorously enough expressed in his
own strong language, as may be seen in Mr. Forster's pages, would not have dreamed of instituting
any such comparison at a later day. But that his critical acumen and judgment were not altogether
destroyed by the enthusiasm of his friendship, is, I think, shown by the following little poem
by Theodosia Trollope, written a few years after the birth of her child. I don't think I need
apologise for printing it.

The original MS. of it before me gives no title; nor do I remember that the authoress ever
assigned one to the verses.

  I.

    "In the noon-day's golden pleasance,
      Little Bice, baby fair,
    With a fresh and flowery presence,
      Dances round her nurse's chair,
  In the old grey loggia dances, haloed by her shining hair.

  II.

    "Pretty pearl in sober setting,
      Where the arches garner shade!
    Cones of maize like golden netting,
      Fringe the sturdy colonnade,
  And the lizards pertly pausing glance across the balustrade.

  III.

    "Brown cicala drily proses,
      Creaking the hot air to sleep,
    Bounteous orange flowers and roses,
      Yield the wealth of love they keep,
  To the sun's imperious ardour in a dream of fragrance deep.

  IV.

    "And a cypress, mystic hearted,
      Cleaves the quiet dome of light
    With its black green masses parted
      But by gaps of blacker night,
  Which the giddy moth and beetle circle round in dubious flight.

  V.

    "Here the well chain's pleasant clanging,
      Sings of coolness deep below;
    There the vine leaves breathless hanging,
      Shine transfigured in the glow,
  And the pillars stare in silence at the shadows which they throw.

  VI.

    "Portly nurse, black-browed, red-vested,
      Knits and dozes, drowsed with heat;
    Bice, like a wren gold-crested,
      Chirps and teases round her seat,
  Hides the needles, plucks the stocking, rolls the cotton o'er her feet.

  VII.

    "Nurse must fetch a draught of water,
      In the glass with painted wings,[1]
    Nurse must show her little daughter
      All her tale of silver rings,
  Dear sweet nurse must sing a couplet--solemn nurse, who never
  sings!

  VIII.

    "Blest Madonna! what a clamour!
      Now the little torment tries,
    Perched on tiptoe, all the glamour
      Of her coaxing hands and eyes!
  May she hold the glass she drinks from--just one moment, Bice cries.

  IX.

    "Nurse lifts high the Venice beaker,
      Bossed with masks, and flecked with gold,
    Scarce in time to 'scape the quicker
      Little fingers over-bold,
  Craving tendril-like to grasp it, with the will of four years old.

  X.

    "Pretty wood bird, pecking, flitting,
      Round the cherries on the tree.
    Ware the scarecrow, grimly sitting,
      Crouched for silly things, like thee!
  Nurse hath plenty such in ambush. 'Touch not, for it burns,'[2] quoth
    she.

  XI.

    "And thine eyes' blue mirror widens
      With an awestroke of belief;
    Meekly following that blind guidance,
      On thy finger's rosy sheaf,
  Blow'st thou softly, fancy wounded, soothing down a painless grief.

  XII.

    "Nurse and nursling, learner, teacher,
      Thus foreshadow things to come,
    When the girl shall grow the creature
      Of false terrors vain and dumb,
  And entrust their baleful fetish with her being's scope and sum.

  XIII.

    "Then her heart shall shrink and wither,
      Custom-straitened like her waist,
    All her thought to cower together,
      Huddling sheep-like with the rest,
  With the flock of soulless bodies on a pattern schooled and laced.

  XIV.

    "Till the stream of years encrust her
      With a numbing mail of stone,
    Till her laugh lose half its lustre,
      And her truth forswear its tone,
  And she see God's might and mercy darkly through a glass alone!

  XV.

    "While our childhood fair and sacred.
      Sapless doctrines doth rehearse,
    And the milk of falsehoods acrid,
      Burns our babe-lips like a curse,
  Cling we must to godless prophets, as the suckling to the nurse.

  XVI.

    "As the seed time, so the reaping,
      Shame on us who overreach,
    While our eyes yet smart with weeping,
      Hearts so all our own to teach,
  Better they and we lay sleeping where the darkness hath no speech!"

[Footnote 1: Those unacquainted with the forms of the old decorated Venetian glass will hardly
understand the phrase in the text. Those who know them will feel the accuracy of the picture.]

[Footnote 2: "Non toccare che brucia," Tuscan proverb.]

It is impossible for any but those who know--not Florence, but--rural Tuscany well, to appreciate
the really wonderful accuracy and picturesque perfection of the above scene from a Tuscan afternoon.
But I think many others will feel the lines to be good. In the concluding stanzas, in which
the writer draws her moral, there are weak lines. But in the first eleven, which paint her
picture, there is not one. Every touch tells, and tells with admirable truth and vividness
of presentation. In one copy of the lines which I have, the name is changed from Bice to "Flavia,"
and this, I take it, because of the entire non-applicability of the latter stanzas to the child,
whose rearing was in her own hands. But the picture of child and nurse--how life-like none
can tell, but I--was the picture of her "baby Beatrice," and the description simply the reproduction
of things seen.

I think I may venture to print also the following lines. They are, in my opinion, far from
being equal in merit to the little poem printed above, but they are pretty, and I think sufficiently
good to do no discredit to her memory. Like the preceding, they have no title.

  I.

  "I built me a temple, and said it should be
  A shrine, and a home where the past meets me,
  And the most evanescent and fleeting of things,
  Should be lured to my temple, and shorn of their wings,
    To adorn my palace of memories.

  II. 

  I might have been own i was just accomplished to
  acknowledge that there is not the something not unlike
  her accomplished page, if you had not cited
  to use-fit into the certificate of the making'years who
    perceive his presence.

  III.

  "I stood in the midst of the forest trees,
  And heard the sweet sigh of the wandering breeze,
  And this with the tinkle of heifer bells,
  As they trill on the ear from the dewy dells,
    Are the sounds in my palace of memories.
