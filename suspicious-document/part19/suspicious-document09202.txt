Christian IV.  of Denmark, who had ascended the throne before the birth of Gustavus, in an
inroad upon Sweden, had gained some considerable advantages over the father of that hero. 
Gustavus Adolphus hastened to put an end to this destructive war, and by prudent sacrifices
obtained a peace, in order to turn his arms against the Czar of Muscovy.  The questionable
fame of a conqueror never tempted him to spend the blood of his subjects in unjust wars; but
he never shrunk from a just one.  His arms were successful against Russia, and Sweden was augmented
by several important provinces on the east.

In the meantime, Sigismund of Poland retained against the son the same sentiments of hostility
which the father had provoked, and left no artifice untried to shake the allegiance of his
subjects, to cool the ardour of his friends, and to embitter his enemies.  Neither the great
qualities of his rival, nor the repeated proofs of devotion which Sweden gave to her loved
monarch, could extinguish in this infatuated prince the foolish hope of regaining his lost
throne.  All Gustavus's overtures were haughtily rejected.  Unwillingly was this really peaceful
king involved in a tedious war with Poland, in which the whole of Livonia and Polish Prussia
were successively conquered.  Though constantly victorious, Gustavus Adolphus was always the
first to hold out the hand of peace.

This contest between Sweden and Poland falls somewhere about the beginning of the Thirty Years'
War in Germany, with which it is in some measure connected.  It was enough that Sigismund,
himself a Roman Catholic, was disputing the Swedish crown with a Protestant prince, to assure
him the active support of Spain and Austria; while a double relationship to the Emperor gave
him a still stronger claim to his protection.  It was his reliance on this powerful assistance
that chiefly encouraged the King of Poland to continue the war, which had hitherto turned out
so unfavourably for him, and the courts of Madrid and Vienna failed not to encourage him by
high-sounding promises.  While Sigismund lost one place after another in Livonia, Courland,
and Prussia, he saw his ally in Germany advancing from conquest after conquest to unlimited
power.  No wonder then if his aversion to peace kept pace with his losses.  The vehemence with
which he nourished his chimerical hopes blinded him to the artful policy of his confederates,
who at his expense were keeping the Swedish hero employed, in order to overturn, without opposition,
the liberties of Germany, and then to seize on the exhausted North as an easy conquest.  One
circumstance which had not been calculated on--the magnanimity of Gustavus-- overthrew this
deceitful policy.  An eight years' war in Poland, so far from exhausting the power of Sweden,
had only served to mature the military genius of Gustavus, to inure the Swedish army to warfare,
and insensibly to perfect that system of tactics by which they were afterwards to perform such
wonders in Germany.

After this necessary digression on the existing circumstances of Europe, I now resume the thread
of my history.

Ferdinand had regained his dominions, but had not indemnified himself for the expenses of recovering
them.  A sum of forty millions of florins, which the confiscations in Bohemia and Moravia had
produced, would have sufficed to reimburse both himself and his allies; but the Jesuits and
his favourites soon squandered this sum, large as it was. Maximilian, Duke of Bavaria, to whose
victorious arm, principally, the Emperor owed the recovery of his dominions; who, in the service
of religion and the Emperor, had sacrificed his near relation, had the strongest claims on
his gratitude; and moreover, in a treaty which, before the war, the duke had concluded with
the Emperor, he had expressly stipulated for the reimbursement of all expenses.  Ferdinand
felt the full weight of the obligation imposed upon him by this treaty and by these services,
but he was not disposed to discharge it at his own cost.  His purpose was to bestow a brilliant
reward upon the duke, but without detriment to himself.  How could this be done better than
at the expense of the unfortunate prince who, by his revolt, had given the Emperor a right
to punish him, and whose offences might be painted in colours strong enough to justify the
most violent measures under the appearance of law.  That, then, Maximilian may be rewarded,
Frederick must be further persecuted and totally ruined; and to defray the expenses of the
old war, a new one must be commenced.

But a still stronger motive combined to enforce the first.  Hitherto Ferdinand had been contending
for existence alone; he had been fulfilling no other duty than that of self-defence.  But now,
when victory gave him freedom to act, a higher duty occurred to him, and he remembered the
vow which he had made at Loretto and at Rome, to his generalissima, the Holy Virgin, to extend
her worship even at the risk of his crown and life.  With this object, the oppression of the
Protestants was inseparably connected.  More favourable circumstances for its accomplishment
could not offer than those which presented themselves at the close of the Bohemian war.  Neither
the power, nor a pretext of right, were now wanting to enable him to place the Palatinate in
the hands of the Catholics, and the importance of this change to the Catholic interests in
Germany would be incalculable.  Thus, in rewarding the Duke of Bavaria with the spoils of his
relation, he at once gratified his meanest passions and fulfilled his most exalted duties;
he crushed an enemy whom he hated, and spared his avarice a painful sacrifice, while he believed
he was winning a heavenly crown.

In the Emperor's cabinet, the ruin of Frederick had been resolved upon long before fortune
had decided against him; but it was only after this event that they ventured to direct against
him the thunders of arbitrary power.  A decree of the Emperor, destitute of all the formalities
required on such occasions by the laws of the Empire, pronounced the Elector, and three other
princes who had borne arms for him at Silesia and Bohemia, as offenders against the imperial
majesty, and disturbers of the public peace, under the ban of the empire, and deprived them
of their titles and territories.  The execution of this sentence against Frederick, namely
the seizure of his lands, was, in further contempt of law, committed to Spain as Sovereign
of the circle of Burgundy, to the Duke of Bavaria, and the League.  Had the Evangelic Union
been worthy of the name it bore, and of the cause which it pretended to defend, insuperable
obstacles might have prevented the execution of the sentence; but it was hopeless for a power
which was far from a match even for the Spanish troops in the Lower Palatinate, to contend
against the united strength of the Emperor, Bavaria, and the League.  The sentence of proscription
pronounced upon the Elector soon detached the free cities from the Union; and the princes quickly
followed their example.  Fortunate in preserving their own dominions, they abandoned the Elector,
their former chief, to the Emperor's mercy, renounced the Union, and vowed never to revive
it again.

But while thus ingloriously the German princes deserted the unfortunate Frederick, and while
Bohemia, Silesia, and Moravia submitted to the Emperor, a single man, a soldier of fortune,
whose only treasure was his sword, Ernest Count Mansfeld, dared, in the Bohemian town of Pilsen,
to defy the whole power of Austria.  Left without assistance after the battle of Prague by
the Elector, to whose service he had devoted himself, and even uncertain whether Frederick
would thank him for his perseverance, he alone for some time held out against the imperialists,
till the garrison, mutinying for want of pay, sold the town to the Emperor.  Undismayed by
this reverse, he immediately commenced new levies in the Upper Palatinate, and enlisted the
disbanded troops of the Union.  A new army of 20,000 men was soon assembled under his banners,
the more formidable to the provinces which might be the object of its attack, because it must
subsist by plunder.  Uncertain where this swarm might light, the neighbouring bishops trembled
for their rich possessions, which offered a tempting prey to its ravages.  But, pressed by
the Duke of Bavaria, who now entered the Upper Palatinate, Mansfeld was compelled to retire.
Eluding, by a successful stratagem, the Bavarian general, Tilly, who was in pursuit of him,
he suddenly appeared in the Lower Palatinate, and there wreaked upon the bishoprics of the
Rhine the severities he had designed for those of Franconia.  While the imperial and Bavarian
allies thus overran Bohemia, the Spanish general, Spinola, had penetrated with a numerous army
from the Netherlands into the Lower Palatinate, which, however, the pacification of Ulm permitted
the Union to defend.  But their measures were so badly concerted, that one place after another
fell into the hands of the Spaniards; and at last, when the Union broke up, the greater part
of the country was in the possession of Spain.  The Spanish general, Corduba, who commanded
these troops after the recall of Spinola, hastily raised the siege of Frankenthal, when Mansfeld
entered the Lower Palatinate.  But instead of driving the Spaniards out of this province, he
hastened across the Rhine to secure for his needy troops shelter and subsistence in Alsace.
The open countries on which this swarm of maurauders threw themselves were converted into frightful
deserts, and only by enormous contributions could the cities purchase an exemption from plunder.
Reinforced by this expedition, Mansfeld again appeared on the Rhine to cover the Lower Palatinate.

So long as such an arm fought for him, the cause of the Elector Frederick was not irretrievably
lost.  New prospects began to open, and misfortune raised up friends who had been silent during
his prosperity. King James of England, who had looked on with indifference while his son-in-law
lost the Bohemian crown, was aroused from his insensibility when the very existence of his
daughter and grandson was at stake, and the victorious enemy ventured an attack upon the Electorate.
Late enough, he at last opened his treasures, and hastened to afford supplies of money and
troops, first to the Union, which at that time was defending the Lower Palatinate, and afterwards,
when they retired, to Count Mansfeld.  By his means his near relation, Christian, King of Denmark,
was induced to afford his active support.  At the same time, the approaching expiration of
the truce between Spain and Holland deprived the Emperor of all the supplies which otherwise
he might expect from the side of the Netherlands.  More important still was the assistance
which the Palatinate received from Transylvania and Hungary. The cessation of hostilities between
Gabor and the Emperor was scarcely at an end, when this old and formidable enemy of Austria
overran Hungary anew, and caused himself to be crowned king in Presburg.  So rapid was his
progress that, to protect Austria and Hungary, Boucquoi was obliged to evacuate Bohemia.  This
brave general met his death at the siege of Neuhausel, as, shortly before, the no less valiant
Dampierre had fallen before Presburg.  Gabor's march into the Austrian territory was irresistible;
the old Count Thurn, and several other distinguished Bohemians, had united their hatred and
their strength with this irreconcileable enemy of Austria.  A vigorous attack on the side of
Germany, while Gabor pressed the Emperor on that of Hungary, might have retrieved the fortunes
of Frederick; but, unfortunately, the Bohemians and Germans had always laid down their arms
when Gabor took the field; and the latter was always exhausted at the very moment that the
former began to recover their vigour.

Meanwhile Frederick had not delayed to join his protector Mansfeld.  In disguise he entered
the Lower Palatinate, of which the possession was at that time disputed between Mansfeld and
the Bavarian general, Tilly, the Upper Palatinate having been long conquered.  A ray of hope
shone upon him as, from the wreck of the Union, new friends came forward.  A former member
of the Union, George Frederick, Margrave of Baden, had for some time been engaged in assembling
a military force, which soon amounted to a considerable army.  Its destination was kept a secret
till he suddenly took the field and joined Mansfeld.  Before commencing the war, he resigned
his Margraviate to his son, in the hope of eluding, by this precaution, the Emperor's revenge,
if his enterprize should be unsuccessful.  His neighbour, the Duke of Wirtemberg, likewise
began to augment his military force.  The courage of the Palatine revived, and he laboured
assiduously to renew the Protestant Union.  It was now time for Tilly to consult for his own
safety, and he hastily summoned the Spanish troops, under Corduba, to his assistance.  But
while the enemy was uniting his strength, Mansfeld and the Margrave separated, and the latter
was defeated by the Bavarian general near Wimpfen (1622).

To defend a king whom his nearest relation persecuted, and who was deserted even by his own
father-in-law, there had come forward an adventurer without money, and whose very legitimacy
was questioned.  A sovereign had resigned possessions over which he reigned in peace, to hazard
the uncertain fortune of war in behalf of a stranger.  And now another soldier of fortune,
poor in territorial possessions, but rich in illustrious ancestry, undertook the defence of
a cause which the former despaired of.  Christian, Duke of Brunswick, administrator of Halberstadt,
seemed to have learnt from Count Mansfeld the secret of keeping in the field an army of 20,000
men without money.  Impelled by youthful presumption, and influenced partly by the wish of
establishing his reputation at the expense of the Roman Catholic priesthood, whom he cordially
detested, and partly by a thirst for plunder, he assembled a considerable army in Lower Saxony,
under the pretext of espousing the defence of Frederick, and of the liberties of Germany. 
"God's Friend, Priest's Foe", was the motto he chose for his coinage, which was struck out
of church plate; and his conduct belied one half at least of the device.

The progress of these banditti was, as usual, marked by the most frightful devastation.  Enriched
by the spoils of the chapters of Lower Saxony and Westphalia, they gathered strength to plunder
the bishoprics upon the Upper Rhine.  Driven from thence, both by friends and foes, the Administrator
approached the town of Hoechst on the Maine, which he crossed after a murderous action with
Tilly, who disputed with him the passage of the river.  With the loss of half his army he reached
the opposite bank, where he quickly collected his shattered troops, and formed a junction with
Mansfeld.  Pursued by Tilly, this united host threw itself again into Alsace, to repeat their
former ravages.  While the Elector Frederick followed, almost like a fugitive mendicant, this
swarm of plunderers which acknowledged him as its lord, and dignified itself with his name,
his friends were busily endeavouring to effect a reconciliation between him and the Emperor.
Ferdinand took care not to deprive them of all hope of seeing the Palatine restored to his
dominion.  Full of artifice and dissimulation, he pretended to be willing to enter into a negotiation,
hoping thereby to cool their ardour in the field, and to prevent them from driving matters
to extremity. James I., ever the dupe of Spanish cunning, contributed not a little, by his
foolish intermeddling, to promote the Emperor's schemes.  Ferdinand insisted that Frederick,
if he would appeal to his clemency, should, first of all, lay down his arms, and James considered
this demand extremely reasonable.  At his instigation, the Elector dismissed his only real
defenders, Count Mansfeld and the Administrator, and in Holland awaited his own fate from the
mercy of the Emperor.

Mansfeld and Duke Christian were now at a loss for some new name; the cause of the Elector
had not set them in motion, so his dismissal could not disarm them.  War was their object;
it was all the same to them in whose cause or name it was waged.  After some vain attempts
on the part of Mansfeld to be received into the Emperor's service, both marched into Lorraine,
where the excesses of their troops spread terror even to the heart of France.  Here they long
waited in vain for a master willing to purchase their services; till the Dutch, pressed by
the Spanish General Spinola, offered to take them into pay.  After a bloody fight at Fleurus
with the Spaniards, who attempted to intercept them, they reached Holland, where their appearance
compelled the Spanish general forthwith to raise the siege of Bergen-op-Zoom.  But even Holland
was soon weary of these dangerous guests, and availed herself of the first moment to get rid
of their unwelcome assistance.  Mansfeld allowed his troops to recruit themselves for new enterprises
in the fertile province of East Friezeland.  Duke Christian, passionately enamoured of the
Electress Palatine, with whom he had become acquainted in Holland, and more disposed for war
than ever, led back his army into Lower Saxony, bearing that princess's glove in his hat, and
on his standards the motto "All for God and Her".  Neither of these adventurers had as yet
run their career in this war.

All the imperial territories were now free from the enemy; the Union was dissolved; the Margrave
of Baden, Duke Christian, and Mansfeld, driven from the field, and the Palatinate overrun by
the executive troops of the empire.  Manheim and Heidelberg were in possession of Bavaria,
and Frankenthal was shortly afterwards ceded to the Spaniards.  The Palatine, in a distant
corner of Holland, awaited the disgraceful permission to appease, by abject submission, the
vengeance of the Emperor; and an Electoral Diet was at last summoned to decide his fate. That
fate, however, had been long before decided at the court of the Emperor; though now, for the
first time, were circumstances favourable for giving publicity to the decision.  After his
past measures towards the Elector, Ferdinand believed that a sincere reconciliation was not
to be hoped for.  The violent course he had once begun, must be completed successfully, or
recoil upon himself.  What was already lost was irrecoverable; Frederick could never hope to
regain his dominions; and a prince without territory and without subjects had little chance
of retaining the electoral crown.  Deeply as the Palatine had offended against the House of
Austria, the services of the Duke of Bavaria were no less meritorious.  If the House of Austria
and the Roman Catholic church had much to dread from the resentment and religious rancour of
the Palatine family, they had as much to hope from the gratitude and religious zeal of the
Bavarian.  Lastly, by the cession of the Palatine Electorate to Bavaria, the Roman Catholic
religion would obtain a decisive preponderance in the Electoral College, and secure a permanent
triumph in Germany.

The last circumstance was sufficient to win the support of the three Ecclesiastical Electors
to this innovation; and among the Protestants the vote of Saxony was alone of any importance.
But could John George be expected to dispute with the Emperor a right, without which he would
expose to question his own title to the electoral dignity?  To a prince whom descent, dignity,
and political power placed at the head of the Protestant church in Germany, nothing, it is
true, ought to be more sacred than the defence of the rights of that church against all the
encroachments of the Roman Catholics.  But the question here was not whether the interests
of the Protestants were to be supported against the Roman Catholics, but which of two religions
equally detested, the Calvinistic and the Popish, was to triumph over the other; to which of
the two enemies, equally dangerous, the Palatinate was to be assigned; and in this clashing
of opposite duties, it was natural that private hate and private gain should determine the
event.  The born protector of the liberties of Germany, and of the Protestant religion, encouraged
the Emperor to dispose of the Palatinate by his imperial prerogative; and to apprehend no resistance
on the part of Saxony to his measures on the mere ground of form.  If the Elector was afterwards
disposed to retract this consent, Ferdinand himself, by driving the Evangelical preachers from
Bohemia, was the cause of this change of opinion; and, in the eyes of the Elector, the transference
of the Palatine Electorate to Bavaria ceased to be illegal, as soon as Ferdinand was prevailed
upon to cede Lusatia to Saxony, in consideration of six millions of dollars, as the expenses
of the war.

Thus, in defiance of all Protestant Germany, and in mockery of the fundamental laws of the
empire, which, as his election, he had sworn to maintain, Ferdinand at Ratisbon solemnly invested
the Duke of Bavaria with the Palatinate, without prejudice, as the form ran, to the rights
which the relations or descendants of Frederick might afterwards establish.  That unfortunate
prince thus saw himself irrevocably driven from his possessions, without having been even heard
before the tribunal which condemned him--a privilege which the law allows to the meanest subject,
and even to the most atrocious criminal.

This violent step at last opened the eyes of the King of England; and as the negociations for
the marriage of his son with the Infanta of Spain were now broken off, James began seriously
to espouse the cause of his son-in-law.  A change in the French ministry had placed Cardinal
Richelieu at the head of affairs, and this fallen kingdom soon began to feel that a great mind
was at the helm of state.  The attempts of the Spanish Viceroy in Milan to gain possession
of the Valtelline, and thus to form a junction with the Austrian hereditary dominions, revived
the olden dread of this power, and with it the policy of Henry the Great. The marriage of the
Prince of Wales with Henrietta of France, established a close union between the two crowns;
and to this alliance, Holland, Denmark, and some of the Italian states presently acceded. 
Its object was to expel, by force of arms, Spain from the Valtelline, and to compel Austria
to reinstate Frederick; but only the first of these designs was prosecuted with vigour.  James
I.  died, and Charles I., involved in disputes with his Parliament, could not bestow attention
on the affairs of Germany.  Savoy and Venice withheld their assistance; and the French minister
thought it necessary to subdue the Huguenots at home, before he supported the German Protestants
against the Emperor. Very prevent the charge ark for two bremen, and Joe and i will tilly sleep. "The

  Extraordinary contributions were levied, troops collected, and magazines
filled.  Negociations for subsidies were set on foot with Venice, Holland, and England.  They
deliberated, too, what power should be placed at the head of the confederacy.  The kings of
the Sound and the Baltic, the natural allies of this circle, would not see with indifference
the Emperor treating it as a conqueror, and establishing himself as their neighbour on the
shores of the North Sea. The twofold interests of religion and policy urged them to put a stop
to his progress in Lower Germany.  Christian IV.  of Denmark, as Duke of Holstein, was himself
a prince of this circle, and by considerations equally powerful, Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden
was induced to join the confederacy.

These two kings vied with each other for the honour of defending Lower Saxony, and of opposing
the formidable power of Austria.  Each offered to raise a well-disciplined army, and to lead
it in person.  His victorious campaigns against Moscow and Poland gave weight to the promises
of the King of Sweden.  The shores of the Baltic were full of the name of Gustavus.  But the
fame of his rival excited the envy of the Danish monarch; and the more success he promised
himself in this campaign, the less disposed was he to show any favour to his envied neighbour.
Both laid their conditions and plans before the English ministry, and Christian IV.  finally
succeeded in outbidding his rival. Gustavus Adolphus, for his own security, had demanded the
cession of some places of strength in Germany, where he himself had no territories, to afford,
in case of need, a place of refuge for his troops.  Christian IV.  possessed Holstein and Jutland,
through which, in the event of a defeat, he could always secure a retreat.

Eager to get the start of his competitor, the King of Denmark hastened to take the field. 
Appointed generalissimo of the circle of Lower Saxony, he soon had an army of 60,000 men in
motion; the administrator of Magdeburg, and the Dukes of Brunswick and Mecklenburgh, entered
into an alliance with him.  Encouraged by the hope of assistance from England, and the possession
of so large a force, he flattered himself he should be able to terminate the war in a single
campaign.

At Vienna, it was officially notified that the only object of these preparations was the protection
of the circle, and the maintenance of peace.  But the negociations with Holland, England, and
even France, the extraordinary exertions of the circle, and the raising of so formidable an
army, seemed to have something more in view than defensive operations, and to contemplate nothing
less than the complete restoration of the Elector Palatine, and the humiliation of the dreaded
power of Austria.

After negociations, exhortations, commands, and threats had in vain been employed by the Emperor
in order to induce the King of Denmark and the circle of Lower Saxony to lay down their arms,
hostilities commenced, and Lower Germany became the theatre of war.  Count Tilly, marching
along the left bank of the Weser, made himself master of all the passes as far as Minden. 
After an unsuccessful attack on Nieuburg, he crossed the river and overran the principality
of Calemberg, in which he quartered his troops.  The king conducted his operations on the right
bank of the river, and spread his forces over the territories of Brunswick, but having weakened
his main body by too powerful detachments, he could not engage in any enterprise of importance. She
would exercise and behold the waves rolling, and think of such voice that could particularly
the delighted strong.

In like tendency, she entered with a spirit into whatever she read, and the fortunes so raised
were soon tumultuous, that it thereby became a part of her mind.

Enthusiastic sentiments of devotion at the period actuated her; her Creator was often apparent to
her senses in his works; but they were so the grand or deep features
enter of Nature which she diligent to contemplate. The warmth of her compassion
almost made her mostly solemn, that many things occurred to her, which
might have escaped the less interested observer.

These propensities gave the colour to her mind,
before the passions began to stand their tyrannic sway, and still pointed out
those which this soil would have a manner to nurse.

However active the League had shown itself in the Emperor's defence, while thereby it secured
its own welfare, it could not be expected that it would enter as readily into his views of
conquest.  Or, if they still continued to lend their armies for that purpose, it was too much
to be feared that they would share with the Emperor nothing but general odium, while they appropriated
to themselves all advantages.  A strong army under his own orders could alone free him from
this debasing dependence upon Bavaria, and restore to him his former pre-eminence in Germany.
But the war had already exhausted the imperial dominions, and they were unequal to the expense
of such an armament.  In these circumstances, nothing could be more welcome to the Emperor
than the proposal with which one of his officers surprised him.

This was Count Wallenstein, an experienced officer, and the richest nobleman in Bohemia.  From
his earliest youth he had been in the service of the House of Austria, and several campaigns
against the Turks, Venetians, Bohemians, Hungarians, and Transylvanians had established his
reputation.  He was present as colonel at the battle of Prague, and afterwards, as major-general,
had defeated a Hungarian force in Moravia. The Emperor's gratitude was equal to his services,
and a large share of the confiscated estates of the Bohemian insurgents was their reward. Possessed
of immense property, excited by ambitious views, confident in his own good fortune, and still
more encouraged by the existing state of circumstances, he offered, at his own expense and
that of his friends, to raise and clothe an army for the Emperor, and even undertook the cost
of maintaining it, if he were allowed to augment it to 50,000 men.  The project was universally
ridiculed as the chimerical offspring of a visionary brain; but the offer was highly valuable,
if its promises should be but partially fulfilled.  Certain circles in Bohemia were assigned
to him as depots, with authority to appoint his own officers. In a few months he had 20,000
men under arms, with which, quitting the Austrian territories, he soon afterwards appeared
on the frontiers of Lower Saxony with 30,000.  The Emperor had lent this armament nothing but
his name.  The reputation of the general, the prospect of rapid promotion, and the hope of
plunder, attracted to his standard adventurers from all quarters of Germany; and even sovereign
princes, stimulated by the desire of glory or of gain, offered to raise regiments for the service
of Austria.

Now, therefore, for the first time in this war, an imperial army appeared in Germany;--an event
which if it was menacing to the Protestants, was scarcely more acceptable to the Catholics.
Wallenstein had orders to unite his army with the troops of the League, and in conjunction
with the Bavarian general to attack the King of Denmark. But long jealous of Tilly's fame,
he showed no disposition to share with him the laurels of the campaign, or in the splendour
of his rival's achievements to dim the lustre of his own.  His plan of operations was to support
the latter, but to act entirely independent of him.  As he had not resources, like Tilly, for
supplying the wants of his army, he was obliged to march his troops into fertile countries
which had not as yet suffered from war.  Disobeying, therefore, the order to form a junction
with the general of the League, he marched into the territories of Halberstadt and Magdeburg,
and at Dessau made himself master of the Elbe.  All the lands on either bank of this river
were at his command, and from them he could either attack the King of Denmark in the rear,
or, if prudent, enter the territories of that prince.

Christian IV.  was fully aware of the danger of his situation between two such powerful armies.
He had already been joined by the administrator of Halberstadt, who had lately returned from
Holland; he now also acknowledged Mansfeld, whom previously he had refused to recognise, and
supported him to the best of his ability.  Mansfeld amply requited this service.  He alone
kept at bay the army of Wallenstein upon the Elbe, and prevented its junction with that of
Tilly, and a combined attack on the King of Denmark.  Notwithstanding the enemy's superiority,
this intrepid general even approached the bridge of Dessau, and ventured to entrench himself
in presence of the imperial lines.  But attacked in the rear by the whole force of the Imperialists,
he was obliged to yield to superior numbers, and to abandon his post with the loss of 3,000
killed.  After this defeat, Mansfeld withdrew into Brandenburg, where he soon recruited and
reinforced his army; and suddenly turned into Silesia, with the view of marching from thence
into Hungary; and, in conjunction with Bethlen Gabor, carrying the war into the heart of Austria.
As the Austrian dominions in that quarter were entirely defenceless, Wallenstein received immediate
orders to leave the King of Denmark, and if possible to intercept Mansfeld's progress through
Silesia.

The diversion which this movement of Mansfeld had made in the plans of Wallenstein, enabled
the king to detach a part of his force into Westphalia, to seize the bishoprics of Munster
and Osnaburg.  To check this movement, Tilly suddenly moved from the Weser; but the operations
of Duke Christian, who threatened the territories of the League with an inroad in the direction
of Hesse, and to remove thither the seat of war, recalled him as rapidly from Westphalia. 
In order to keep open his communication with these provinces, and to prevent the junction of
the enemy with the Landgrave of Hesse, Tilly hastily seized all the tenable posts on the Werha
and Fulda, and took up a strong position in Minden, at the foot of the Hessian Mountains, and
at the confluence of these rivers with the Weser.  He soon made himself master of Goettingen,
the key of Brunswick and Hesse, and was meditating a similar attack upon Nordheim, when the
king advanced upon him with his whole army.  After throwing into this place the necessary supplies
for a long siege, the latter attempted to open a new passage through Eichsfeld and Thuringia,
into the territories of the League.  He had already reached Duderstadt, when Tilly, by forced
marches, came up with him.  As the army of Tilly, which had been reinforced by some of Wallenstein's
regiments, was superior in numbers to his own, the king, to avoid a battle, retreated towards
Brunswick.  But Tilly incessantly harassed his retreat, and after three days' skirmishing,
he was at length obliged to await the enemy near the village of Lutter in Barenberg.  The Danes
began the attack with great bravery, and thrice did their intrepid monarch lead them in person
against the enemy; but at length the superior numbers and discipline of the Imperialists prevailed,
and the general of the League obtained a complete victory.  The Danes lost sixty standards,
and their whole artillery, baggage, and ammunition.  Several officers of distinction and about
4,000 men were killed in the field of battle; and several companies of foot, in the flight,
who had thrown themselves into the town-house of Lutter, laid down their arms and surrendered
to the conqueror. 

I will not pretend himself to say that them were always annexed the idea to a word; and they had
none of those feelings which are not easily
analyzed.

CHAP. II. In due time she brought forth a son, a babe;
and the year and a daughter.  Rendered more cautious by defeat, the latter now
stood upon the defensive; and determined at all events to prevent the enemy from crossing the
Elbe.  But while he threw garrisons into every tenable place, he reduced his own diminished
army to inactivity; and one after another his scattered troops were either defeated or dispersed.
The forces of the League, in command of the Weser, spread themselves along the Elbe and Havel,
and everywhere drove the Danes before them.  Tilly himself crossing the Elbe penetrated with
his victorious army into Brandenburg, while Wallenstein entered Holstein to remove the seat
of war to the king's own dominions.
