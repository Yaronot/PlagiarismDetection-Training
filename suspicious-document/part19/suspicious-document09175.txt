practice, made smooth and supple was obtained. This was the basis for his love of life and his
humor, his perseverance and the admirable elasticity with which he jumped up after the worst
disaster ever again. The gods had given him, but with the power and the sensitivity and vulnerability of the soul,
without which an artist of genius is inconceivable. He could break out in loud cheers when he went
on a beautiful morning in the countryside, but he felt even more deeply than others the blows of fate,
and it is to him a full fair amount of them have won. The unusual susceptibility and irritability
met an amazing memory: what delighted or wounded, is held by the people. His mind knew no bounds
as its capacity. He had, with all security on the versatility of the will of the facilities and
interests of Richard Wagner, and even reminiscent of Goethe and told myself that have much space
in his head.

He was initially assessed for all visual arts and is still far from
being merely a colourist.

The earliest power with which he has entered the public was, according to A. Frey of the design of
a city gate for the railway from Strasbourg to Basel. Architectural understanding betrayed his
paintings. As a painter he has gone from the landscape, but he has occasional portraits and sculptures
created, which are among the most popular of the century and finally in many figures wall and
easel paintings are highest paid. He has also cut gems and furniture
design.

BÃ¶cklin has over the years, similarly to Rubens for his purposes,
the whole art of the past, as far as she could reach studied.

His greatest admiration was the architecture, sculpture and painting of the ancient world. The
Romanesque and Gothic art he loved, but it can be found in a sketchbook Basel two statues of the
Freiburg Cathedral and he praised the author of these lines the old glass paintings of Sta. Croce
in Florence. Next day I stepped into the chief jeweler's to set
it by the exact time, and the head of the establishment took it out of my hand and proceeded
to set it for me.  Then he said, "She is four minutes slow-regulator wants pushing up."  I
tried to stop him--tried to make him understand that the watch kept perfect time. Of course they
work as a landscape painter born say something to stimuli that destroyed some preparation
is one - what one should believe. The procedure, form and beauty, to observe the "great interest"
for a "very satisfied" the difference between the commitment to clarity, but it was different
from his own 'Holbein', as pointed in the direction of
  At the end of two months it had left
all the timepieces of the town far in the rear, and was a fraction over thirteen days ahead
of the almanac.  It was away into November enjoying the snow, while the October leaves were
still turning. When they had lowered the coffin, our old pastor went to the Edge of the
grave and said a word of consolation and of promise, and he was my late parents always been a faithful
friend and Rater, and I was confirmed by him, by him and I Lisei been married. All around the
churchyard, it was black with people, it seemed from the burials the old puppet expect will take a very
special show. - And something special really happened, but it was noticed only by us, we were the
tomb first. Lisei who had gone out of my arms, had just taken my hand convulsively, as now the
old clergyman to the custom according to the provided spade and took the first earth on the
coffin threw down. It sounded dull back from the tomb. "From the earth are you put "now sounded
the word of the priest;! but hardly had he spoken than I of the enclosure looked forth over
the heads of some people to fly on us. I meant first it was a big bird, but it fell and fell
straight into the tomb. In a cursory look around - because I was raised slightly higher, on the
ground - I had Schmidt one of the boys cower behind the churchyard wall and then run away to
see, and I suddenly knew what had happened. Lisei uttered a cry at my side, our old pastor was
inconclusive as the spade for the second litter in the hands. A Look into the grave, confirmed
my hunch: the top of the coffin, among the flowers and the Earth that covered some of them already,
because he had sat down, the old friend from my Childhood, Punch, .-- the little funny guy,
but he saw all the world now not even funny off, his big beak nose, he had lowered sadly at
the chest, one arm with the dexterous thumb was stretched out against the sky, and when he is
to announce that after all puppet played, up there now going to start another piece.

I saw it all just for a moment, because even threw the provost, the second in plaice The Crypt: "And
to the earth again shall you be!" - And as it rolled down from the
coffin, then Punch also fell from its flower in the depth and was
covered by the earth.

Then with the last blade throw came the consoling promise: "And thou
from earth you rise again!

was speaking as the Lord's Prayer and the people had lost, was the old Provost to us, who still
stared into the pit. "It has to be a wickedness" he said as he took our loving hands. "Let's
take it otherwise!
He fixed it, and gave it a fresh start.  It did well now, except that always at ten minutes
to ten the hands would shut together like a pair of scissors, and from that time forth they
would travel together.  The oldest man in the world could not make head or tail of the time
of day by such a watch, and so I went again to have the thing repaired.  This person said that
the crystal had got bent, and that the mainspring was not straight.  He also remarked that
part of the works needed half-soling.  He made these things all right, and then my timepiece
performed unexceptionably, save that now and then, after working along quietly for nearly eight
hours, everything inside would let go all of a sudden and begin to buzz like a bee, and the
hands would straightway begin to spin round and round so fast that their individuality was
lost completely, and they simply seemed a delicate spider's web over the face of the watch. I didn't think, "she
cried, as we both walked in the door" What have taken you so long to act? Come into the house! The
food is on the table, and the master is ready to read the letter from Joseph and the Old champion!
