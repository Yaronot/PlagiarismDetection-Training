 Carthage would
no doubt have undergone a similar change of character, had the policy which was carried to
its greatest height by the aspiring house of Barcas succeeded in converting her from a trading
city into the capital of a great military empire. So would Venice, had she been able to carry
on her system of conquest in the Levant and of territorial aggrandisement on the Italian mainland.
The career of Venice was arrested by the League of Cambray. On Carthage the policy of military
aggrandisement, which was apparently resisted by the sage instinct of the great merchants while
it was supported by the professional soldiers and the populace, brought utter ruin; while Rome
paid the inevitable penalty of military despotism. Even when the Roman nobles had become a
caste of conquerors and proconsuls, they retained certain mercantile habits; unlike the French
aristocracy, and aristocracies generally, they were careful keepers of their accounts, and
they showed a mercantile talent for business, as well as a more than mercantile hardness, in
their financial exploitation of the conquered world. Brutus and his contemporaries were usurers
like the patricians of the early times. No one, we venture to think, who has been accustomed
to study national character, will believe that the Roman character was formed by war alone:
it was manifestly formed by war combined with business.

To what an extent the later character of Rome affected national tradition, or rather fiction,
as to her original character, we see from the fable which tells us that she had no navy before
the first Punic war, and that when compelled to build a fleet by the exigencies of that war,
she had to copy a Carthaginian war galley which had been cast ashore, and to train her rowers
by exercising them on dry land. She had a fleet before the war with Pyrrhus, probably from
the time at which she took possession of Antium, if not before; and her first treaty with Carthage
even if it is to be assigned to the date to which Mommsen, and not to that which Polybius assigns
it, shows that before 348 B.C. she had an interest in a wide sea-board, which must have carried
with it some amount of maritime power.

 Greek intellect showed its superiority
in speculative politics as in all other departments of speculation, but as a practical politician
the Greek was not self-controlled or strong, and he would never have bestowed on the provinces
of his empire local self- government and municipal life; besides, the race, though it included
wonderful varieties in itself, was, as a race, intensely tribal, and treated persistently all
other races as barbarians. It would have deprived mankind of Roman law and politics, as well
as of that vast extension of the Roman aedileship which covered the world with public works
beneficent in themselves and equally so as examples; whereas the Roman had the greatness of
soul to do homage to Greek intellect, and, notwithstanding an occasional Mummius, preserved
all that was of the highest value in Greek civilization, better perhaps than it would have
been preserved by the tyrants and condottieri of the Greek decadence. As to a Semitic Empire,
whether in the hands of Syrians or Carthaginians, with their low Semitic craft, their Moloch-worships
and their crucifixions,--the very thought fills us with horror. It would have been a world-wide
tyranny of the strong box, into which all the products of civilization would have gone. Parcere
subjectis was the rule of Rome as well as debellare superbos; and while all conquest is an
evil, the Roman was the most clement and the least destructive of conquerors. This is true
of him on the whole, though he sometimes was guilty of thoroughly primaeval cruelty. He was
the great author of the laws of war as well as of the laws of peace. That he not seldom, when
his own interest was concerned, put the mere letter of the social law in place of justice,
and that we are justly revolted on these occasions by his hypocritical observance of forms,
is very true: nevertheless, his scrupulosity and the language of the national critics in these
cases prove the existence of at least a rudimentary conscience. No compunction for breach of
international law or justice we may be sure ever visited the heart of Tiglath-Pileser. Cicero's
letter of advice to his brother on the government of a province may seem a tissue of truisms
now, though Warren Hastings and Sir Elijah Impey would hardly have found it so, but it is a
landmark in the history of civilization. That the Roman Republic should die, and that a colossal
and heterogeneous empire should fall under the rule of a military despot, was perhaps a fatal
necessity; but the despotism long continued to be tempered, elevated, and rendered more beneficent
by the lingering spirit of the Republic; the liberalism of Trajan and the Antonines was distinctly
republican nor did Sultanism finally establish itself before Diocletian. Perhaps we may number
among the proofs of the Roman's superiority the capacity shown so far as we know first by him
of being touched by the ruin of a rival. We may be sure that no Assyrian conqueror even affected
to weep over the fall of a hostile city however magnificent and historic. On the whole it must
be allowed that physical influences have seldom done better for humanity than they did in shaping
the imperial character and destinies of Rome.
