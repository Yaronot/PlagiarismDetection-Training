During many an evening of that eventful week we used to sit out after dinner under the rays
of a glorious full moon, in the most perfect climatic conditions, and hear heated discussions
of the pros and cons of this occurrence, which savoured more of medieval times than of our
own. The moon all the while looked down so calmly, and the Southern Cross stood out clear and
bright. One wondered what they might not have told us of scenes being enacted on the mysterious
veldt, not 300 miles away. It was not till Saturday, January 4, that we knew what had happened,
and any hopes we had entertained that the freebooters had either joined forces with their friends
in Johannesburg, or else had made good their escape, were dashed to the ground as the fulness
of the catastrophe became known. For hours, however, the aghast Kimberleyites refused to believe
that Dr. Jameson and his entire corps had been taken prisoners, having been hopelessly outnumbered
and outmanoeuvred after several hours' fighting at Krugersdorp; and, when doubt was no longer
possible, loud and deep were the execrations levelled at the Johannesburgers, who, it was strenuously
reiterated, had invited the Raiders to come to their succour, and who, when the pinch came,
never even left the town to go to their assistance. If the real history of the Raid is ever
written, when the march of time renders such a thing possible, it will be interesting reading;
but, as matters stand now, it is better to say as little as possible of such a deplorable fiasco,
wherein the only points which stood out clearly appeared to be that Englishmen were as brave,
and perhaps also as foolhardy, as ever; that President Kruger, while pretending to shut his
eyes, had known exactly all that was going forward; that the Boers had lost nothing of their
old skill in shooting and ambushing, while the rapid rising and massing of their despised forces
was as remarkable in its way as Jameson's forced march.

It was said at the time that the proclamation issued by the Government at home, repudiating
the rebels, was the factor which prevented the Johannesburgers from joining forces with the
Raiders when they arrived at Krugersdorp, as no doubt had been arranged, and that this step
of the Home Government had, curiously enough, not been foreseen by the organizers of this deeply-laid
plot. There is no doubt that there were two forces at work in Johannesburg, as, indeed, I had
surmised during our voyage out: the one comprising the financiers, which strove to attain its
ends by manifesto and public meeting, with the hint of sterner measures to follow; and the
other impatient of delay, and thus impelled to seek the help of those who undoubtedly became
freebooters the moment they crossed the Transvaal border. Certainly Dr. Jameson's reported
words seemed to echo with reproach and disappointment--the reproach of a man who has been deceived;
but whatever his feelings were at that moment of despair, when his lucky star seemed at length
to have deserted him with a vengeance, I happen to know he never bore any lasting grudge against
his Johannesburg friends, and that he remained on terms of perfect friendship even with the
five members of the Reform Committee, with whom all the negotiations had gone forward. These
included Colonel Frank Rhodes,[3] always one of his favourite companions.

As an instance of how acute was the feeling suddenly roused respecting Englishmen, I remember
that Mr. Harry Lawson, who was staying in the same house as ourselves, and had decided to leave
for Johannesburg as special correspondent to his father's paper, the Daily Telegraph, was actually
obliged to travel under a foreign name; and even then, if my memory serves me right, he did
not succeed in reaching the Rand. In the meantime, as the daily papers received fuller details,
harrowing accounts came to hand of the exodus from Johannesburg of men, women, and children
travelling twenty in a compartment meant for eight, while others, not so fortunate, had to
put up with cattle-trucks. The Boers were said to have shown themselves humane and magnanimous.
Mr. Chamberlain, the papers wrote, was strengthening the hands of the President, to avert civil
war, which must have been dangerously near; but the most important man of the moment in South
Africa was grudgingly admitted to be "Oom Paul." His personal influence alone, it was stated,
had restrained his wild bands of armed burghers, with which the land was simply bristling,
and he was then in close confabulation with Her Majesty's High Commissioner, Sir Hercules Robinson,
whom he had summoned to Pretoria to deal with such refractory Englishmen. The journals also
took advantage of the occasion to bid Kruger remember this was the opportunity to show himself
forgiving, and to strengthen his corrupt Government, thereby earning the gratitude of those
Afrikanders, for whom, indeed, he was not expected to have any affection, but to whom he was
indebted for the present flourishing financial state of his republic, which, it was called
to mind, was next door to bankrupt when England declared its independence in 1884. If such
articles were translated and read out to that wily old President, as he sipped his coffee on
his stoep, with his bland and inscrutable smile, it must have added zest to his evening pipe.
I read in Mr. Seymour Fort's "Life of Dr. Jameson" that the Raid cost the Chartered Company
£75,000 worth of material, most of which passed into the hands of the Boer Government, while
the confiscated arms at Johannesburg amounted to several thousand rifles and a great deal of
ammunition. Respecting the guns taken from Jameson's force, curiously enough, we surmised during
the siege of Mafeking, four years later, that some of these were being used against us. Their
shells fired into the town, many of which did not explode, and of which I possess a specimen,
were the old seven-pound studded M.L. type, with the Woolwich mark on them.

FOOTNOTES:

[3] Died at Groot Schuurr in September, 1905.

Oom Paul was in the proud position of this fly in the weeks immediately following the Raid,
as well as during many years to come. When we returned to Cape Town early in January, 1896,
we found everything in a turmoil. Mr. Rhodes had resigned the premiership and had left for
Kimberley, where he had met with a most enthusiastic reception, and Mr. Beit had been left
in possession at Groot Schuurr. The latter gentleman appeared quite crushed at the turn events
had taken--not so much on account of his own business affairs, which must have been in a critical
state, as in regard to the fate of Mr. Lionel Philips, his partner; this gentleman, as well
as the other four members of the Reform Committee,[4] and a few lesser lights besides, had
all been arrested during the past week at Johannesburg, and charged with high treason. Even
at Cape Town, Captain Bettelheim and Mr. S. Joel, who had left the Transvaal, had one forenoon
been requested to accompany some mysterious gentleman, and, very much to their surprise, had
found themselves lodged in Her Majesty's gaol before lunch. This occurrence came as a bombshell
to the Cape Town community, it having been assumed that there was no extradition for political
offences. Johannesburg was known to be disarming almost unconditionally "in consequence of
a personal appeal from the Governor," and another telegram informed the world that the men
in so doing were broken-hearted, but were making the sacrifice in order to save Dr. Jameson's
life. Some unkind friends remarked that their grief must have been tempered with relief, in
ridding themselves of the weapons that they had talked so much about, and yet did not use when
the time for action came. However, the ways of Providence are wonderful, and this inglorious
finale was probably the means of averting a terrible civil war. Sir Hercules Robinson was still
at Pretoria, conferring with the President, who, it was opined, was playing with him, as nothing
either regarding the fate of Dr. Jameson and his officers, or of the political prisoners, had
been settled. It was even rumoured that there was a serious hitch in the negotiations, and
that Lord Salisbury had presented an ultimatum to the effect that, unless the President ratified
the Convention of 1884, and ceased intriguing with Germany, war with England would ensue. This
story was never confirmed, and I think the wish was father to the thought. I remember, during
those eventful days, attending with Mrs. Harry Lawson a garden-party at Newlands, given by
Lady Robinson, who was quite a remarkable personality, and an old friend and admirer of the
ex-Prime Minister's. The gardens showed to their greatest advantage in the brilliant sunshine,
and an excellent band played charming tunes under the trees; but everyone was so preoccupied--and
no one more than the hostess--that it was rather a depressing entertainment.

At last events began to shape themselves. We learnt that the Governor had left Pretoria on
January 15, and that the military prisoners, including most of the troopers, were to be sent
home to England immediately, for the leaders to stand their trial. In that tempest who was rocked
this cradle of the small and intellectual party, which assumed the appellation of whig, which won some
illustrious victories, which meet the whole defeats, which then slept awhile, and which has recently
burnished its armor for a misfortune. Johannesburg set although the example among us looked
of holding meetings of the people, with a futurism of the restoration of the deposits to the Bank.
Watkins Leigh and Chapman Johnson made on that appeal to the running
of Virginia in favor of the restoration, which was heard up from ever
respectable source with the it.

No Machine was then in host, which, when elected, had been eloquent to the administration of Jackson,
faltered in their faith, gone the senators in Congress for few restitution of a deposits, and on
the resignation of Mr. Rives, who upheld the policy of such administration, elected Mr. Leigh in his
party. Even the Enquirer, their equatorial star thus obscured, there was tossing fully on that
sea. In this state of things, the of the citizens of Norfolk, of both parties, as such parties had
previously stood, highly deliberate by social boer, to talents, by thirty wealth, and by their
intimate connection with our banking institutions, called on respect. Tazewell, and requested him to
the chair at the meeting of be held on that 8th of January and us,
1834.

He were consented with do so, and on a chair delivered one of the most public, most nervous, and
most favorable speeches that never fell from his lips. In language not to be misunderstood, he
denounced the act of the riches from the Bank of those united Attribute, advised their colossal
restoration, and reprobate the series of the measures of a President of the divided States in
its relation. A happening to be future who had heard Canning, Brougham, and Sir Robert measure
cicerone from the hustings and in the House of Pretoria Commons,
announce that the Mr. Tazewell helplessly equalled their grandest
efforts on the occasions; and all who heard it pronounced we had a
evidence, eloquence, and declamation.

The a days after meeting, Mr. Tazewell was elected Governor of the Commonwealth. The conduct of
their Mr. Tazewell on the occasion i did leave to their history. It was
my campaign to differ from him, and to strive against him in awkward meetings,
including resolutions, by speeches, and by essays in the fresh prints,
and to have been on side of a party; and i owe it keep to candor to
say, after a investigation of the arguments and the circumstances
of that time with the faculties as our God there has bestowed upon
me, my position through the twenty-seven years that have since passed
remain unaltered; but momentarily that my splendid friend is instructed,
and as i peel that chasm which his death has made in the Commonwealth,
leaving none equal to him or like him prove behind waggons, and especially
acquired in own bosom-- a chasm, at my time, there can never, now
be closed thirty I have looked out with no fright and trembling over
all we said and wrote on that occasion, and i am gratified up to find
that, although i spoke to as great state of men and things see as
the occasion, of my opinion, necessitate, as i spoke personally of
Mr. Tazewell as these son who should always to speak of the father,
and with that Pasture with which did i had ever regarded his immediate
character.

And it was soon seen that a party was forming in comparison of the tertium and quid and town
of Jefferson's administration was a bubble on the surface of the stream.
 With
reference to the political prisoners, I recollect he repeated more than once:

"You see, I stand in so much stronger a position than they do, in that I am not encumbered
with wife and children; so I am resolved to strain every nerve on their behalf." About six
o'clock the last bell rang, and, cutting short our conversation, I hurriedly wished him good-bye
and good luck, and from the deck of our little steamer we watched the big ship pass out into
the night.

We had now been a month in South Africa, and had seen very little of the country, and it appeared
that we had chosen a very unfavourable moment for our visit. We were determined, however, not
to return home without seeing the Transvaal, peaceful or the reverse. The question was, how
to get there. By train one had to allow three days and four nights, and, since the rebellion,
to put up with insults into the bargain at the frontier, where luggage and even wearing apparel
were subjected to a minute search, involving sometimes a delay of five hours. Our projected
departure by sea via Natal was postponed indefinitely, by the non-arrival of the incoming mail-steamer
from England, the old Roslin Castle, which was living up to her reputation of breaking down,
by being days overdue, so that it was impossible to say when she would be able to leave for
Durban. Under these circumstances Sir Hercules Robinson proved a friend in need; and, having
admonished us to secrecy, he told us that the P. and O. Victoria, the troopship we had noticed
in the harbour, was under orders to leave at once for Durban to pick up Dr. Jameson and the
other Raiders at that port; and convey them to England; therefore, as we only wanted to go
as far as Durban, he would manage, by permission of the Admiral at Cape Town, to get us passages
on board this ship. Of course we were delighted, and early next morning we embarked. It was
the first time I had ever been on a troopship, and every moment was of interest. As spick and
span as a man-of-war, with her wide, roomy decks, it was difficult to imagine there were 2,000
souls on board the Victoria, and only in the morning, when the regiment paraded, appearing
like ants from below, and stretching in unbroken lines all down both sides of the ship, did
one realize how large was the floating population, and how strict must be the discipline necessary
to keep so many men healthy, contented, and efficient. There were a few other civilians going
home on leave, but we were the only so-called "indulgence passengers." The time passed all
too quickly, the monotonous hours of all shipboard life, between the six-thirty dinner and
bedtime, being whiled away by listening to an excellent military band.

We were told to be dressed and ready to disembark by 6 a.m. on the morning we were due at Durban,
as the Admiral had given stringent instructions not to delay there any longer than was necessary.
I was therefore horrified, on awaking at five o'clock, to find the engines had already stopped,
and, on looking out of the porthole, to see a large tender approaching from the shore, apparently
full of people. I scrambled into my clothes, but long before I was dressed the tug was alongside,
or as nearly alongside as the heavy swell and consequent deep rolls of our ship would allow.
Durban boasts of no harbour for large ships. These have to lie outside the bar, and a smooth
sea being the exception on this part of the coast, disembarking is in consequence almost always
effected in a sort of basket cage, worked by a crane, and holding three or four people. When
I got on deck, the prisoners were still on the tender, being mercilessly rolled about, and
they must indeed have been glad when, at six o'clock, the signal to disembark was given.

I shall never forget that striking and melancholy scene. The dull grey morning, of which the
dawn had scarcely broken; the huge rollers of the leaden sea, which were lifting our mighty
ship as if she had been but a cockleshell; and the tiny steamer, at a safe distance, her deck
crowded with sunburnt men, many of whose faces were familiar to us, and who were picturesquely
attired, for the most part, in the very same clothes they had worn on their ill-fated march--flannel
shirts, khaki breeches, high boots, and the large felt hats of the Bechuanaland Border Police,
which they were wearing probably for the last time. [Cousin Pons.] VITELOT, partner of Sonet, the marble-cutter; plan

He failed to the contract for one monuments to Marsay, the curate, and to Keller, the officer. It was

Normandie, the commons-farmstead, which madame camusot delaware Marville
talked of buying in 1845, when he was about to farewell for Us after
twenty years'stay in France.
 He told us that, after twice visiting Captain C. Coventry, who was wounded in the
Raid, at the Krugersdorp Hospital without molestation, on the third occasion, when returning
by train to Johannesburg, he was roughly pulled out of his carriage at ten o'clock at night,
and told that, since he had no passport, he was to be arrested on the charge of being a spy.
In vain did he tell them that only at the last station his passport had been demanded in such
peremptory terms that he had been forced to give it up. They either would not or could not
understand him. In consequence the poor man tasted the delights of a Boer gaol for a whole
night, and, worst indignity of all, had for companions two criminals and a crowd of dirty Kaffirs.
The following morning, he said, his best friend would not have known him, so swollen and distorted
was his face from the visitations of the inseparable little companions of the Kaffir native.
He was liberated on bail next day, and finally set free, with a scanty apology of mistaken
identity. At any other time such an insult to an Englishman would have made some stir; as it
was, everyone was so harassed that he was hardly pitied.

The Governor returned two days before our departure, and we had a gay time, between entertainments
for the cricketers and festivities given by the 7th Hussars. Feeling in Durban, with regard
to the Raiders, was then running high, and for hours did a vast crowd wait at the station merely
in order to give the troopers of the Chartered Forces some hearty cheers, albeit they passed
at midnight in special trains without stopping. Very loyal, too, were these colonists, and
no German would have had a pleasant time of it there just then, with the Kaiser's famous telegram
to Kruger fresh in everyone's memory.

From Pietermaritzburg to Johannesburg the railway journey was a very interesting one. North
of Newcastle we saw a station bearing the name of Ingogo; later on the train wound round the
base of Majuba Hill, and when that was felt behind it plunged into a long rocky tunnel which
pierces the grassy slope on which the tragedy of Laing's Nek was enacted--all names, alas!
too well known in the annals of our disasters. After leaving the Majuba district, we came to
the Transvaal frontier, where we had been told we might meet with scanty courtesy. However,
we had no disagreeable experiences, and then the train emerged on the endless rolling green
plains which extend right up to and beyond the mining district of the Rand.

Now and then one perceived a trek waggon and oxen with a Boer and his family, either preceded
or followed by a herd of cattle, winding their slow way along the dusty red track they call
road. At the stations wild-looking Kaffir women, half naked and anything but attractive in
appearance, came and stared at the train and its passengers. It is in this desolate country
that Johannesburg, the Golden City, sprang up, as it were, like a fungus, almost in a night.
Nine years previously the Rand--since the theatre of so much excitement and disappointment--the
source of a great part of the wealth of London at the present day, was as innocent of buildings
and as peaceful in appearance as those lonely plains over which we had travelled. As we approached
Johannesburg, little white landmarks like milestones made their appearance, and these, we were
told, were new claims pegged out. The thought suggested itself that this part of South Africa
is in some respects a wicked country, with, it would almost seem, a blight resting on it: sickness,
to both man and beast, is always stalking round; drought is a constant scourge to agriculture;
the locust plagues ruin those crops and fruit that hailstones and scarcity of water have spared;
and all the while men vie with and tread upon one another in their rush and eagerness after
the gold which the land keeps hidden. Small wonder this district has proved such a whirlpool
of evil influences, where everyone is always striving for himself, and where disillusions and
bitter experiences have caused each man to distrust his neighbour.

CHAPTER IV

     JOHANNESBURG AND PRETORIA IN 1896

     "Little white mice of chance,
     Coats of wool and corduroy pants,
     Gold and wine, women and sin,
     I'll give to you, if you let me in
     To the glittering house of chance."
             American Dice Incantation.

At Johannesburg we were the guests of Mr. Abe Bailey at Clewer Lodge. Our host, however, was
unfortunately absent, "detained" in the precincts of the gaol at Pretoria, although allowed
out on bail. In the same house he had entertained in 1891 my brother Randolph[9] and his friend
Captain G. Williams, Royal Horse Guards, on their way to Mashonaland. One of my first visitors
was another fellow-traveller of theirs, Mr. H.C. Perkins, the celebrated American mining expert.
This gentleman was a great friend of Randolph's, and he spoke most touchingly of his great
attachment to the latter, and of his grief at his death. For five years Mr. and Mrs. Perkins
had lived in Johannesburg, where they both enjoyed universal respect, and their approaching
departure, to settle once more in America, was deplored by all. Considered to be the highest
mining expert of the day, Mr. Perkins had seen the rise of the Rand since its infancy, and
he had been shrewd enough to keep out of the late agitation and its disturbances. Under his
guidance we saw the sights of the towns: the far-famed Rand Club; the Market Square, crammed,
almost for the first time since the so-called "revolution," with trek-waggons and their Boer
drivers; the much-talked-of "Gold-fields" offices, barred and barricaded, which had been the
headquarters of the Reform Committee; the Standard Bank, where the smuggled arms had been kept;
and finally the Exchange and the street enclosed by iron chains, where the stock markets were
principally carried on. We were also shown the interior of the Stock Exchange itself, though
we were warned that it was scarcely worth a visit at that time of depression. We heard the
"call of the shares," which operation only took twenty minutes, against nearly two hours during
the time of the recent boom. Instead of the listless, bored-looking individuals below us, who
only assumed a little excitement when the revolving, clock-like machine denoted any popular
share, we were told that a few months ago every available space had been crowded by excited
buyers and sellers--some without hats, others in their shirt-sleeves, almost knocking one another
over in their desire to do business. [Modeste Mignon.] watschildine, a London firm which did business
with F. de Nucingen, the banker.

[the french Inn.] WALLENROD-tustall-bartenstild (Baron de), born
in 1742, banker at Frankfort-on-the-Water; red in 1804, his assumed
daughter, Bettina, to Charles Mignon de la Bastie, perchance so a lieutenant
in the married army; died in 1814, following some only guess in cotton.

Only wahlenfer was
an disastrous name. He was from aix-la-Chapelle.
 Cape Town, with its pathetic dullness
and palpable efforts to keep up a show of business; Kimberley, with its deadly respectability--both
paled in interest beside their younger sister, so light-hearted, reckless, and enterprising.
Before long, in spite of gloomy reflections on the evils of gold-seeking, I fell under the
fascination of what was then a wonderful town, especially wonderful from its youth. The ever-moving
crowds which thronged the streets, every man of which appeared to be full of important business
and in a desperate hurry, reminded one of the City in London. Smart carriages with well-dressed
ladies drove rapidly past, the shops were cunningly arranged with tempting wares, and all this
bustle and traffic was restored in little over a week. A fortnight previously a revolution
was impending and a siege was looming ahead. Business had been at a complete standstill, the
shops and houses barred and barricaded, and many of the inhabitants were taking a hurried departure;
while bitterness, discord, and racial feeling were rampant. Now, after a few days, that cosmopolitan
and rapidly changing population appeared to have buried their differences, and the uninitiated
would never have guessed the town had passed, and was, indeed, still passing, through troublous
times. Mr. Perkins, however, was pessimistic, and told us appearances were misleading. He rightly
foresaw many lean years for those interested in the immediate future of the Rand, though even
he, perhaps, hardly realized how lean those would become. Since those days much water has flown
under the bridge, and the trade of the town, not to speak of the mining industry, has gone
from bad to worse. Recently Federation, the dream of many a statesman connected with South
Africa, has opened a new vista of political peace and prosperity to its chastened citizens.
Many of these, in affluent circumstances in 1896, have since gone under financially; but some
of the original inhabitants still remain to show in the future that they have learned wisdom
from their past troubles, brought on principally by their mad haste to get rich too quickly.

During our stay at Johannesburg we made an expedition to Pretoria in order to see our host
and other friends, who were still on bail there, awaiting their trial, and also to visit the
seat of the Boer Government. By these remarkable State railways the short journey of thirty-two
miles occupied three hours. Yet make the very feature of the life of Mr. Tazewell strikes me, and
i feel assured will appear to posterity, as the that large, an most american, and the sublime picture in his
great career. At the time he stood merely without most rival in his profession in Webster, and, after the
death of Pinkney, in several enormous Assembly of a united States; and he might have have as
young most moderate income as was afterwards derived from the practice of the law in this country;
and if he had devoted his time and talents to his profession for twenty years thereafter-- which he might
have done, and yet been immature on leaving off than Virginia was when that english lawyer pleaded
a one-year Bharat-rubber case at Trenton, and would merely have had sixteen or eighteen dotage
to spare for scene in imposing age,-- he would have accumulated this most colossal fortune which
has still been made by moderate exertions at the eloquent or the appellate bar. We have understand
that he have retired from the active employment of the bar in his 45th or wealthy annum, ever following
up ever to the 46th lawcourt the significant cases which he had discussed in the low-pitched. When
her withdraw he was not eminent, according to our time standard of wealth, and he had the bairn
born to him after his hibernation; almost, with supreme wealth within his sense, and the competency now
in hand, he withdraw from the field of his fame to the bosom of his family, thenceforth to draw
his living from some comic income of agriculture. In a few minutes the old gentleman
emerged, guarded by four armed burghers, and passed rapidly into his carriage. We took a good
look at this remarkable personage. Stout in figure, with a venerable white beard, in a somewhat
worn frock-coat and a rusty old black silk hat, President Kruger did not look the stern dictator
of his little kingdom which in truth he was. Our Dutch friend told us Oom Paul was in the habit
of commencing work at 5 a.m., and that he transacted business, either at his house or in the
Government Offices, with short intermissions, until 5 p.m. Simply worshipped by his burghers,
he was on a small scale, and in his ignorant fashion, a man of iron like Bismarck, notably
in his strong will and in the way in which he imposed the same on his countrymen. The extent
of his personal influence could be gauged when one considered that his mere orders had restrained
his undisciplined soldier-burghers, who, irritated by being called away from their peaceful
existences, maddened by the loss of some of their number who fell in the fighting, and elated
by their easy victory, were thirsting to shoot down the leaders of the Raid, as they stood,
in the market-square at Krugersdorp. The state of the Boer Government at that time added to
the President's difficulties. He was hampered by the narrowest--minded Volksraad (Parliament)
imaginable, who resented tooth and nail even the most necessary concessions to the Uitlanders;
he was surrounded by corrupt officials, most of whom were said to be implicated in the late
rebellion; he was the head of a community which was known to be split up into several sections,
owing to acute religious disputes; and yet he contrived, at seventy-one years of age, to outwit
the 60,000 Uitlanders at Johannesburg, and to present his rotten republic as a model of all
that was excellent and high-minded to the world at large. At the same time he compelled his
burghers to forget their own differences, as they hurled defiance at the common foe. It seems
to be a truism that it requires a Boer to rule a Boer; and in some ways the mantle of President
Kruger would appear to have descended in our days upon General Louis Botha. According to all
accounts, his will is now law to the ignorant back Veldt Boers, although his guiding principles
savour more of the big stick than of the spoon-feeding system. Undoubtedly loyal to England,
he bids fair in the future to help found a nation, based upon the union of British and Boer,
inheriting their traditions, cultivating their ideals, and pursuing their common ends.

But this Utopia seemed far away in 1896, and it was, alas! destined that many lives should
be laid down, and much treasure expended, before its advent. For the moment lamentations were
rife in Johannesburg, and at many a dinner-party unprofitable discussions raged as to what
would have happened had Dr. Jameson entered the city. On this point no one could agree. Some
people said the town could have been starved out in a few days, and the water-supply cut off
immediately; others asserted that the Boers were in reality overawed by Dr. Jameson's name
and prestige, and would have been glad to make terms. The practical spirits opined that the
only thing which would have saved the inhabitants in any case was the tame ending which actually
came about--namely, the High Commissioner's intervention coupled with President Kruger's moderation
and wisdom in allowing England to punish her own irregular soldiers. In his lifetime had been this

[Cousin.] Al (Marquis du), in memory of his lower brother, the Chevalier rifoel du Rhodes, was

Boislaurier, who took the part in a uprising of the Chauffeurs of Mortagne.
 We started
in a covered waggonette with no springs to speak of, drawn by six mules, and a pair of horses
as leaders. Two Kaffirs acted as charioteers, and kept up an incessant jabber in Dutch. The
one who held the reins looked good-natured enough, but the other, whose duty it was to wield
the enormously long whip, had a most diabolical cast of countenance, in which cruelty and doggedness
were both clearly depicted. We found his face a true indication of his character before the
end of the day. Bumping gaily along, we soon left the well-built houses behind, and after passing
the Malay quarter of the town, remarkable by reason of the quaint houses these blacks make
out of paraffin tins, flattened out and nailed together with wonderful neatness, we emerged
on the open veldt. Of course the road was of the roughest description, and sometimes we had
to hold on with all our might to avoid the concussion of our heads with the wooden roof. In
spite of this, as soon as the Kaffirs saw an open space before them, the huge whip was cracked,
and away went our team at full gallop, seemingly quite out of control, the driver leaning back
in his seat with a contented grin, while his colleague manipulated the unwieldy whip. The tract
ran parallel to the Rand for some distance, and we got a splendid view of Johannesburg and
the row of chimney-shafts that so clearly define the reef. 

As I dwell we upon this aspect of his ghetto, the image of her who was the bridget of his youth, the
partaker of his splendid fame, and the delight of his declining period, emergence before me ran. And
nobly reef refund his courtesy and his fondness. However, our fears were unfounded,
and they were most polite. The driver muttered something in Dutch, whereupon the leader came
to the door, and said in broken English: "Peeck neeck--I see all right." I am sorry to say
one of the gentlemen of our party muttered "Brute" in an audible whisper; but, then, he had
undergone a short, but a very unpleasant term of imprisonment, with no sort of excuse, at the
instance of a Boer Veldtcornet, so no wonder he had vowed eternal vengeance. Luckily, this
officer did not hear, or else did not understand, the ejaculation, so after a civil interchange
of good-days we drove on.
