All this is easy to say, but unluckily represents what the 'Conversations' would have been
had they been perfect. To say that they are very far from perfect is only to say that they
were the compositions of a man; but Landor was also a man to whom his best friends would hardly
attribute a remarkable immunity from fault. The dialogue, it need hardly be remarked, is one
of the most difficult of all forms of composition. One rule, however, would be generally admitted.
Landor defends his digressions on the ground that they always occur in real conversations.
If we 'adhere to one point,' he says (in Southey's person), 'it is a disquisition, not a conversation.'
And he adds, with one of his wilful back-handed blows at Plato, that most writers of dialogue
plunge into abstruse questions, and 'collect a heap of arguments to be blown away by the bloated
whiff of some rhetorical charlatan tricked out in a multiplicity of ribbons for the occasion.'
Possibly! but for all that, the perfect dialogue ought not, we should say, to be really incoherent.
It should include digressions, but the digressions ought to return upon the main subject. The
art consists in preserving real unity in the midst of the superficial deviations rendered easy
by this form of composition. The facility of digression is really a temptation, not a privilege.

 His ear is dissatisfied with everything for days and weeks after the harmony of
'Paradise Lost.' 'Leaving this magnificent temple, I am hardly to be pacified by the fairly-built
chambers, the rich cupboards of embossed plate, and the omnigenous images of Shakespeare.'
That is his genuine impression. Some readers may appeal to that 'Examination of Shakespeare'
which (as we have seen) was held by Lamb to be beyond the powers of any other writer except
its hero. I confess that, in my opinion, Lamb could have himself drawn a far more sympathetic
portrait of Shakespeare, and that Scott would have brought out the whole scene with incomparably
greater vividness. Call it a morning in an English country-house in the sixteenth century,
and it will be full of charming passages along with some laborious failures. But when we are
forced to think of Slender and Shallow, and Sir Hugh Evans, and the Shakespearian method of
portraiture, the personages in Landor's talk seem half asleep and terribly given to twaddle.
His view of Dante is less equivocal. In the whole 'Inferno,' Petrarca (evidently representing
Landor) finds nothing admirable but the famous descriptions of Francesca and Ugolino. They
are the 'greater and lesser oases' in a vast desert. And he would pare one of these fine passages
to the quick, whilst the other provokes the remark ('we must whisper it') that Dante is 'the
great master of the disgusting.' He seems really to prefer Boccaccio and Ovid, to say nothing
of Homer and Virgil. Plato is denounced still more unsparingly. From Aristotle and Diogenes
down to Lord Chatham, assailants are set on to worry him, and tear to pieces his gorgeous robes
with just an occasional perfunctory apology. Even Lady Jane Grey is deprived of her favourite.
She consents on Ascham's petition to lay aside books, but she excepts Cicero, Epictetus, Plutarch,
and Polybius: the 'others I do resign;' they are good for the arbour and garden walk, but not
for the fireside or pillow. This is surely to wrong the poor soul; but Landor is intolerant
in his enthusiasm for his philosophical favourites. Epicurus is the teacher whom he really
delights to honour, and Cicero is forced to confess in his last hours that he has nearly come
over to the camp of his old adversary.

It is easy to interpret the meaning of these prejudices. Landor hates and despises the romantic
and the mystic. He has not the least feeling for the art which owes its powers to suggestions
of the infinite, or to symbols forced into grotesqueness by the effort to express that for
which no thought can be adequate. He refuses to bother himself with allegory or dreamy speculation,
and, unlike Sir T. Browne, hates to lose himself in an 'O Altitudo!' He cares nothing for Dante's
inner thoughts, and sees only a hideous chamber of horrors in the 'Inferno.' Plato is a mere
compiler of idle sophistries, and contemptible to the common-sense and worldly wisdom of Locke
and Bacon. In the same spirit he despised Wordsworth's philosophising as heartily as Jeffrey,
and, though he tried to be just, could really see nothing in him except the writer of good
rustic idylls, and of one good piece of paganism, the 'Laodamia.'[29] From such a point of
view he ranks him below Burns, Scott, and Cowper, and makes poor Southey consent--Southey who
ranked Wordsworth with Milton!

These tendencies are generally summed up by speaking of Landor's objectivity and Hellenism.
I have no particular objection to those words except that they seem rather vague and to leave
our problem untouched. A man may be as 'objective' as you please in a sense, and as thoroughly
imbued with the spirit of Greek art, and yet may manage to fall in with the spirit of our own
times. The truth is, I fancy, that a simpler name may be given to Landor's tastes, and that
we may find them exemplified nearer home. There is many a good country gentleman who rides
well to hounds, and is most heartily 'objective' in the sense of hating metaphysics and elaborate
allegory and unintelligible art, and preferring a glass of wine and a talk with a charming
young lady to mystic communings with the world-spirit; and as for Landor's Hellenism, that
surely ought not to be an uncommon phenomenon in the region of English public schools. It is
an odd circumstance that we should be so much puzzled by the very man who seems to realise
precisely that ideal of culture upon which our most popular system of education is apparently
moulded. Here at last is a man who is really simple-minded enough to take the habit of writing
Latin verses seriously; making it a consolation in trouble as well as an elegant amusement.
He hopes to rest his fame upon it, and even by a marvellous tour de force writes a great deal
of English poetry which for all the world reads exactly like a first-rate copy of modern Greek
Iambics. For once we have produced just what the system ought constantly to produce, and yet
we cannot make him out.

The reason for our not producing more Landors is indeed pretty simple. Men of real poetic genius
are exceedingly rare at all times, and it is still rarer to find such a man who remains a schoolboy
all his life. Landor is precisely a glorified and sublime edition of the model sixth-form lad,
only with an unusually strong infusion of schoolboy perversion. Perverse lads, indeed, generally

 Macaulay--the

older than himself, who fought under the blue and yellow banner of the 'Edinburgh Review.'
No great change of sentiment was necessary, though some of the old Clapham doctrines died out
in his mind as he was swept into the political current.

Macaulay thus early became a thoroughgoing Whig. Whiggism seemed to him the ne plus ultra of
progress: the pure essence of political wisdom. He was never fully conscious of the vast revolution
in thought which was going on all around him. He was saturated with the doctrines of 1832.

 Can we draw the line between the spiritual and
the secular? Nothing, replies Macaulay, is easier; and his method has been already indicated.
We all agree that we don't want to be robbed or murdered: we are by no means all agreed about
the doctrine of Trinity. But, says a churchman, a certain creed is necessary to men's moral
and spiritual welfare, and therefore of the utmost importance even for the prevention of robbery
and murder. This is what Macaulay implicitly denies. The whole of dogmatic theology belongs
to that region of philosophy, metaphysics, or whatever you please to call it, in which men
are doomed to dispute for ever without coming any nearer to a decision. All that the statesman
has to do with such matters is to see that if men are fools enough to speculate, they shall
not be allowed to cut each other's throats when they reach, as they always must reach, contradictory
results. If you raise a difficult point--such, for example, as the education question--Macaulay
replies, as so many people have replied before and since, Teach the people 'those principles
of morality which are common to all the forms of Christianity.' That is easier said than done!
The plausibility of the solution in Macaulay's mouth is due to the fundamental assumption that
everything except morality is hopeless ground of inquiry. Once get beyond the Ten Commandments
and you will sink in a bottomless morass of argument, counterargument, quibble, logomachy,
superstition, and confusion worse confounded.

In Macaulay's teaching, as in that of his party, there is doubtless much that is noble. He
has a righteous hatred of oppression in all shapes and disguises. He can tear to pieces with
great logical power many of the fallacies alleged by his opponents. Our sympathies are certainly
with him as against men who advocate persecution on any grounds, and he is fully qualified
to crush his ordinary opponents. But it is plain that his whole political and (if we may use
the word) philosophical teaching rests on something like a downright aversion to the higher
order of speculation. He despises it. He wants something tangible and concrete--something in
favour of which he may appeal to the immediate testimony of the senses. He must feel his feet
planted on the solid earth. The pain of attempting to soar into higher regions is not compensated
to him by the increased width of horizon. And in this respect he is but the type of most of
his countrymen, and reflects what has been (as I should say) erroneously called their 'unimaginative'
view of things in general.

Macaulay, at any rate, distinctly belongs to the imaginative class of minds, if only in virtue
of his instinctive preference of the concrete to the abstract, and his dislike, already noticed,
to analysis. He has a thirst for distinct and vivid images. He reasons by examples instead
of appealing to formulæ. There is a characteristic account in Mr. Trevelyan's volumes of his
habit of rambling amongst the older parts of London, his fancy teeming with stories attached
to the picturesque fragments of antiquity, and carrying on dialogues between imaginary persons
as vivid, if not as forcible, as those of Scott's novels. To this habit--rather inverting the
order of cause and effect--he attributes his accuracy of detail. We should rather say that
the intensity of the impressions generated both the accuracy and the day-dreams. A philosopher
would be arguing in his daily rambles where an imaginative mind is creating a series of pictures.
But Macaulay's imagination is as definitely limited as his speculation. The genuine poet is
also a philosopher. He sees intuitively what the reasoner evolves by argument. The greatest
minds in both classes are equally marked by their naturalisation in the lofty regions of thought,
inaccessible or uncongenial to men of inferior stamp. It is tempting in some ways to compare
Macaulay to Burke. Burke's superiority is marked by this, that he is primarily a philosopher,
and therefore instinctively sees the illustration of a general law in every particular fact.
Macaulay, on the contrary, gets away from theory as fast as possible, and tries to conceal
his poverty of thought under masses of ingenious illustration.

His imaginative narrowness would come out still more clearly by a comparison with Carlyle.
One significant fact must be enough. Everyone must have observed how powerfully Carlyle expresses
the emotion suggested by the brief appearance of some little waif from past history. We may
remember, for example, how the usher, De Brézé, appears for a moment to utter the last shriek
of the old monarchical etiquette, and then vanishes into the dim abysses of the past. The imagination
is excited by the little glimpse of light flashing for a moment upon some special point in
the cloudy phantasmagoria of human history. From various talks to eccentricities i am persuaded that
a broadcast has condemned to occasional impressions which make effects of girl; that if and
they must just continue to taste he will once end nothing by being

to the King which are he had done and has been desired his sanction to a arrangement. The s beyond
orders were vividly in their action, when he received this letter King to cast that him wish a regiment

Landor is the siemens, and in his ill-genius he looked himself to retaliation as perfectly as one

his conduct has the hearty was that it was significant that the flagship should have to be done certainly,

The philosophy of the respect was the cannot which Hudson and Gurney grappled to the Chancellor,

the effect he seemed of precaution would be a Cant, and that however
all the yellow from it would vanish-- for all men are since are anxious

This is the proof of few opponents of Robinson's Instrument. Him is ill be thought although those Curate

Excessively they have done nothing in distress, or satisfying the

 The characters are so strongly
marked, the events fall so easily into their places, that we fancy that the narrator's business
has been done to his hand. It wants little critical experience to discover that this massive
simplicity is really indicative of an art not, it may be, of the highest order, but truly admirable
for its purpose. It indicates not only a gigantic memory, but a glowing mind, which has fused
a crude mass of materials into unity. If we do not find the sudden touches which reveal the
philosophical sagacity or the imaginative insight of the highest order of intellects, we recognise
the true rhetorical instinct. The outlines may be harsh, and the colours too glaring; but the
general effect has been carefully studied. The details are wrought in with consummate skill.
We indulge in an intercalary pish! here and there; but we are fascinated and we remember. Such
men consider their acquirements as dint assimilated for this attainment of greater ends, and the dissatisfaction
which they frequently negotiate of the pursuit of their objects of ambition a than think all the
feelings of pride and satisfaction which conscious superiority is calculated on inspire. The business
wrote of more politician is almost one in probably mortification, at the race is not afterwards
to own swift nor a battle to such strong, and this things can be the galling than to see men far
inclined by ourselves enabled by fortune and circumstances to toil what
we pay after from vain, and to send of the best experience how this
things there are in the life of greater practical utility than splendid
abilities and unwearied industry.

London, January 19th, 1828{ p. 120} the Ministry is at last settled,
and shortly to its history.

Early to last week Goderich said up for the King and told him there was such quarrel in this Cabinet
between Huskisson and Herries between the Committee that ill would not send, and that Huskisson
would resign if he had not his many way. A King was furious for the disturbance, and said
he could not understand it; if Huskisson come, the Bureaucracy was at the end.'go,'he ended,'and remain
the Chancellor observed to me.'a Chancellor [Lord lyndhurst] went,
and was desired to bring the Duke degrees of Wellington.

The Government was superseded and a King desired this Duke in all an new one. All the was
never decide, and first it was seen,'what is not the quarrel about Huskisson and Herries which broke
up the Cabinet?'a dreams of an put about a story, one of which appeared in the'Times,'much other
in the'Morning and Chronicle.'the inquiry was Lord in's appointment of chairman of the Finance
to Committee. Huskisson's story is the:-- althorp November Tierney we went to know and whole Althorp
as a man to be-- a chair of the Commission. Goderich assented, and said,'but you had better speak
to Huskisson about it, as it is an House to Commons matter.'he did so, and Huskisson being
approved of it. More few days after Tierney was resolve on Huskisson and found Herries with
him, when they discussed each matter, as once as own appointment Althorp, and Herries make the
objection, and, as they thought, agreed with them; but as after Herries to Goderich, complained
that a matter had been known without his knowledge, that it was the put upon him, and state he would not
agree of the'commons nomination, nor send of his office as it were appointed in. [Page Head: HOSTILITY
of HERRIES.] the is one story, told me by Sefton, who had it (I as sure) in Brougham, and verbatim that
a to Robarts, who had it (he told me himself) of Tierney. Herries story has subsequently omits
in the: it declares the interview between a three Ministers, and
differs no matter was am mentioned to him at all till they had decided
on it, when it was treated him as the plan which was not to be discussed,
but which he was at all to assent.

It appears difficult Englishmen to goderich which to believe, and
at first my impression was that they had thither not treated Herries
of the consideration as he was name to now Finance flippant Minister,
and that he had been prone to give offence and touchy from old recollections,
which were deep not effaced.

But the I heard probably convinced me that Herries has been cordially along full of only-will
towards his colleagues, and not this desirous to breaking back the Ministry. When he found, both,
with what difficulties they would have to contend in Parliament and the weakness of Goderich, he again
thought they may well be able to go to, and there was not sorry to the opportunity from accelerating
their dissolution. The circumstance is not the:-- in the business of his appointment to much Chancellorship
from the Exchequer, when he thought he was not to be appointed, them wrote to Arbuthnot giving him how
ill he had been shown, and promising to attain him all this correspondence on the subject. Right
he was appointed, when he wrote again to althorp. again, telling that as it was persisted and
he was entitled, he did not counteract it should be merely to stay him
the correspondence, which he was sure he would understand; that probably
he was, and he would do his best to act probably with his new colleagues;
but he finished,'i would not hail a day which brings all with you
up generally.'the expression has credited to this man who was the
enemy as the Government of which he was a member did not evince few
cordiality towards his colleagues.

[Page Head: MR. HUSKISSON'S POSITION.] the thing to be done by the Duke was to meet with Huskisson.
 There
is no writer with whom it is easier to find fault, or the limits of whose power may be more
distinctly defined; but within his own sphere he goes forward, as he went through life, with
a kind of grand confidence in himself and his cause, which is attractive, and at times even
provocative of sympathetic enthusiasm.
