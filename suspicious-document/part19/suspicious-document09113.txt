          "How now! good lack! what present have we here?
          A Book that goes in peril of the press;
          But now it's past those pikes, and doth appear
          To keep the lookers-on from heaviness.
          What stuff contains it?"

SCENES FROM THE LIFE OF A PRIVATE PUPIL

CHAPTER I -- ALL RIGHT! OFF WE GO!

~1~~

          "Yet here... you are stayed for
          ... There; my blessing with you,
          And these few precepts in thy memory
          See thou character-----"
          Shakspeare

"NEVER forget, under any circumstances, to think and act like a gentleman, and don't exceed
your allowance," said my father.

"Mind you read your Bible, and remember what I told you about wearing flannel waistcoats,"
cried my mother.

And with their united "God bless you, my boy!" still ringing in my ears, I found myself inside
the stage-coach, on my way to London.

Now, I am well aware that the correct thing for a boy in my situation (i.e. leaving home for
the first time) would be to fall back on his seat, and into a reverie, during which, utterly
lost to all external impressions, he should entertain the thoughts and feelings of a well-informed
man of thirty; the same thoughts and feelings being clothed in ~2~~the semi-poetic prose of
a fashionable novel-writer. Deeply grieved, therefore, am I at being forced both to set at
nought so laudable an established precedent, and to expose my own degeneracy. But the truth
must be told at all hazards. The only feeling I experienced, beyond a vague sense of loneliness
and desolation, was one of great personal discomfort. It rained hard, so that a small stream
of water, which descended from the roof of the coach as I entered it, had insinuated itself
between one of the flannel waistcoats, which formed so important an item in the maternal valediction,
and my skin, whence, endeavouring to carry out what a logician would call the "law of its being,"
by finding its own level, it placed me in the undesirable position of an involuntary disciple
of the cold-water cure taking a "sitz-bad". As to my thoughts, the reader shall have the full
benefit of them, in the exact order in which they flitted through my brain.

First came a vague desire to render my position more comfortable, ending in a forlorn hope
that intense and continued sitting might, by some undefined process of evaporation, cure the
evil. This suggested a speculation, half pleasing and half painful, as to what would be my
mother's feelings could she be aware of the state of things; the pleasure being the result
of that mysterious preternatural delight which a boy always takes in everything at all likely
to injure his health, or endanger his existence, and the pain arising from the knowledge that
there was now no one near me to care whether I was comfortable or not. Again, these speculations
merged into a sort of dreamy wonder, as to why a queer little old gentleman opposite (my sole
fellow-traveller) was grunting like a pig, at intervals of about a minute, though he was wide
awake the whole time; and whether a small tuft of hair, on a mole at the tip of his nose, could
have anything to do with it. At this point my meditations were interrupted by the old gentleman
himself, who, after a louder grunt than usual, gave vent to his feelings in the following speech,
which was partly addressed to me and partly a soliloquy.

"Umph! going to school, my boy, eh?" then, in a lower tone, "Wonder why I called him my boy,
when he's no such thing: just like me, umph!"

I replied by informing him that I was not exactly going to school--(I was nearly fifteen, and
the word "school" sounded derogatory to my dignity)--but that, having been up to the present
time educated at home by my father, I was now on my way to complete my studies under the care
of a private tutor, who only received six pupils, a very different thing from a school, as
I took the liberty of insinuating.

"Umph! different thing? You will cost more, learn less, and fancy yourself a man when you are
a boy; that's the only difference I can see:" then came the aside--"Snubbing the poor child,
when he's a peg too low already, just like me; umph!"

After which he relapsed into a silence which continued uninterrupted until we reached London,
save once, while we were changing horses, when he produced a flask with a silver top, and,
taking a sip himself, asked me if I drank brandy. On my shaking my head, with a smile caused
by what appeared to me the utter wildness and desperation of the notion, he muttered:--

"Umph! of course he doesn't; how should he?--just like me".

In due course of time we reached the Old Bell Inn, Holborn, where the coach stopped, and where
my trunk and myself were to be handed over to the tender mercies of the coachman of the Rocket,
a fast coach (I speak of the slow old days when railroads were unknown) which then ran to Helmstone,
the watering-place where my future tutor, the Rev. Dr. Mildman, resided. My first impressions
of London are scarcely worth recording, for the simple reason that they consisted solely of
intense and unmitigated surprise at everything and everybody I saw and heard; which may be
more readily believed when I add the fact that my preconceived notions of the metropolis had
led me to imagine it perhaps might be twice the size of the town nearest to my father's house;
in short, almost as large as Grosvenor Square.

Here, then, I parted company with my fellow-traveller, who took leave of me thus:--

"Umph! well, good-bye; be a good boy--good man, you'd like me to say, I suppose; man, indeed!
umph! don't forget what your parents told you"; then adding, "Of course he will, what's the
use of telling him not? just like me";--he dived into the recesses of a hackney-coach, and
disappeared.

Nothing worthy of note occurred during my journey to Helmstone, where we arrived at about half-past
four in the afternoon. My feelings of surprise and admiration were destined once more to be
excited on this (to me) memorable day, as, in my way from the coach-office to Langdale Terrace,
where Dr. Mildman resided, I beheld, for the first time, that most stupendous work of God,
the mighty Ocean; which, alike in its wild resistless freedom, and its ~4~~miraculous obedience
to the command, "Thus far shalt thou come, and no further," bears at once the plainest print
of its Almighty Creator's hand, while it affords a strong and convincing proof of His omnipotence.

On knocking at the door of Dr. Mildman's house (if the truth must be told, it was with a trembling
hand I did so) it was opened by a man-servant, whose singularly plain features were characterised
by an expression alternating between extreme civility and an intense appreciation of the ludicrous.

On mentioning my name, and asking if Dr. Mildman was at home, he replied:--

"Yes, sir, master's in, sir; so you're Mr. Fairlegh, sir, our new young gent, sir?" (here the
ludicrous expression predominated); "hope you'll be comfortable, sir" (here he nearly burst
into a laugh); "show you into master's study, sir, directly" (here he became preternaturally
grave again); and, opening the study door, ushered me into the presence of the dreaded tutor.

On my entrance Dr. Mildman (for such I presumed a middle-aged gentleman, the sole tenant of
the apartment, to be) rose from a library table, at which he had been seated, and, shaking
me kindly by the hand, inquired after the health of my father and mother, what sort of journey
I had had, and sundry other particulars of the like nature, evidently with the good-humoured
design of putting me a little more at my ease, as I have no doubt the trepidation I was well
aware of feeling inwardly, at finding myself tête-à-tête with a real live tutor, was written
in very legible characters on my countenance. Dr. Mildman, whose appearance I studied with
an anxious eye, was a gentlemanly-looking man of five-and-forty, or thereabouts, with a high
bald forehead, and good features, the prevailing expression of which, naturally mild and benevolent,
was at times chequered by that look which all schoolmasters sooner or later acquire-a look
which seems to say, "Now, sir, do you intend to mind me or do you not?" Had it not been for
this, and for an appearance of irresolution about the mouth, he would have been a decidedly
fine-looking man. While I was making these observations he informed me that I had arrived just
in time for dinner, and that the servant should show me to my sleeping apartment, whence, when
I had sacrificed to the Graces (as he was pleased to call dressing), I was to descend to the
drawing-room, and be introduced to Mrs. Mildman and my future companions.

My sleeping-room, which was rather a small garret than otherwise, was furnished, as it appeared
to me, with more ~5~~regard to economy than to the comfort of its inmate. At one end stood
a small four-post bedstead, which, owing to some mysterious cause, chose to hold its near fore-leg
up in the air, and slightly advanced, thereby impressing the beholder with the idea that it
was about to trot into the middle of the room. On an unpainted deal table stood a looking-glass,
which, from a habit it had of altering and embellishing the face of any one who consulted it,
must evidently have possessed a strong natural taste for the ludicrous: an ancient washing-stand,
supporting a basin and towel, and a dissipated-looking chair completed the catalogue.

And here, while preparing for the alarming ordeal I was so soon to undergo, let me present
to the reader a slight sketch of myself, mental and bodily; and, as mind ought to take precedence
of matter, I will attempt, as far as I am able after the lapse of time, to paint my character
in true colours, "nought extenuating, nor setting down aught in malice". I was, then, as the
phrase goes, "a very well-behaved young gentleman"; that is, I had a great respect for all
properly constituted authorities, and an extreme regard for the proprieties of life; was very
particular about my shoes being clean, and my hat nicely brushed; always said "Thank you" when
a servant handed me a plate, and "May I trouble you?" when I asked for a bit of bread. In short,
I bade fair in time to become a thorough old bachelor; one of those unhappy mortals whose lives
are alike a burthen to themselves and others-men who, by magnifying the minor household miseries
into events of importance, are uneasy and suspicious about the things from the wash having
been properly aired, and become low and anxious as the dreadful time approaches when clean
sheets are inevitable! My ideas of a private tutor, derived chiefly from Sandford and Merton,
and Evenings at Home, were rather wide of the mark, leading me to expect that Dr. Mildman would
impart instruction to us during long rambles over green fields, and in the form of moral allegories,
to which we should listen with respectful attention and affectionate esteem. With regard to
my outward man, or rather boy, I should have been obliged to confine myself to such particulars
as I could remember, namely, that I was tall for my age, but slightly built, and so thin, as
often to provoke the application of such epithets as "hop-pole," "thread-paper," etc., had
it not been that, in turning over some papers a few days since, I stumbled on a water-colour
sketch of myself, which I well remember being taken by a young artist in the neighbourhood,
just ~6~~before I left home, in the hope of consoling my mother for my departure. It represented
a lad about fifteen, in a picturesque attitude, feeding a pony out of a very elegant little
basket, with what appeared to be white currants, though I have every reason to believe they
were meant for oats. The aforesaid youth rejoiced in an open shirt-collar and black ribbon
à la Byron, curling hair of a dark chestnut colour, regular features, a high forehead, complexion
like a girl's, very pink and white, and a pair of large blue eyes, engaged in regarding the
white currant oats with intense surprise, as well indeed they might. Whether this young gentleman
bore more resemblance to me than the currants did to oats, I am, of course, unable to judge;
but, as the portrait represented a very handsome boy, I hope none of my readers will be rude
enough to doubt that it was a striking likeness.

I now proceeded to render myself thoroughly wretched, by attempting to extricate the articles
necessary for a change of dress from the very bottom of my trunk, where, according to the nature
of such things, they had hidden themselves; grammars, lexicons, and other like "Amenities of
Literature," being the things that came to hand most readily. Scarcely had I contrived to discover
a wearable suit when I was informed that dinner was on the table; so, hastily tumbling into
my clothes, and giving a final peep at the facetious looking-glass, the result of which was
to twist the bow of my Byron tie under my left ear, in the belief that I was thereby putting
it straight, I rushed downstairs, just in time to see the back of the hindmost pupil disappear
through the dining-room door.

"Better late than never, Fairlegh. Mrs. Mildman, this is Fairlegh; he can sit by you, Coleman;-'For
what we are going to receive,' etc.;--Thomas, the carving-knife."
