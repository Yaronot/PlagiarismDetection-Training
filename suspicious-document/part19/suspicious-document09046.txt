I always want to find the fundamental emotion out of which a poet writes. It is easy to do
this with some, with writers like Shelley and Wordsworth, for they talked much of abstract
things, and a man never reveals himself so fully as when he does this, when he tries to interpret
nature, when he has to fill darkness with light, and chaos with meaning. A man may speak about
his own heart and may deceive himself and others, but ask him to fill empty space with significance,
and what he projects on that screen will be himself, and you can know him even as hereafter
he will be known. When a poet puts his ear to a shell, I know if he listens long enough he
will hear his own destiny. I knew after reading "The Shell" that in James Stephens we were
going to have no singer of the abstract. There was no human quality or stir in the blind elemental
murmur, and the poet drops it with a sigh of relief:

     O, it was sweet
     To hear a cart go jolting down the street.

From the tradition of the world too he breaks away, from the great murmuring shell which gives
back to us our cries and questionings and protests soothed into soft, easeful things and smooth
orthodox complacencies, for it was shaped by humanity to whisper back to it what it wished
to hear. From all soft, easeful beliefs and silken complacencies the last Irish poet breaks
away in a book of insurrections. He is doubtful even of love, the greatest orthodoxy of any,
which so few have questioned, which has preceded all religions and will survive them all. When
he writes of love in "The Red-haired Man's Wife" and "The Rebel" he is not sure that that old
intoxication of self-surrender is not a wrong to the soul and a disloyalty to the highest in
us. His "Dancer" revolts from the applauding crowd. The wind cries out against the inference
that the beauty of nature points inevitably to an equal beauty of spirit within. His enemies
revolt against their hate; his old man against his own grumblings, and the poet himself rebels
against his own revolt in that quaint scrap of verse he prefixes to the volume:

     What's the use
     Of my abuse?
     The world will run
     Around the sun
     As it has done
     Since time begun
     When I have drifted to the deuce:
     And what's the use
     Of my abuse?

He does not revolt against the abstract like so many because he is incapable of thinking. Indeed,
he is one of the few Irish poets we have who is always thinking as he goes along. He does not
rebel against love because he is not himself sweet at heart, for the best thing in the book
is its unfeigned humanity. So we have a personal puzzle to solve with this perplexing writer
which makes us all the more eager to hear him again. A man might be difficult to understand
and the problem of his personality might not be worth solution, but it is not so with James
Stephens. From a man who can write with such power as he shows in these two stanzas taken from
"The Street behind Yours" we may expect high things. It is a vision seen with distended imagination
as if by some child strayed from light:

     And though 'tis silent, though no sound
     Crawls from the darkness thickly spread,
     Yet darkness brings
     Grim noiseless things
     That walk as they were dead,
     They glide and peer and steal around
     With stealthy silent tread.

     You dare not walk; that awful crew
     Might speak or laugh as you pass by.
     Might touch or paw
     With a formless claw
     Or leer from a sodden eye,
     Might whisper awful things they knew,
     Or wring their hands and cry.

There is nothing more grim and powerful than that in The City of Dreadful Night. It has all
the vaporous horror of a Dore grotesque and will bear examination better. But our poet does
not as a rule write with such unrelieved gloom. He keeps a stoical cheerfulness, and even when
he faces terrible things we feel encouraged to take his hand and go with him, for he is master
of his own soul, and you cannot get a whimper out of him. He likes the storm of things, and
is out for it. He has a perfect craft in recording wild natural emotions. The verse in this
first book has occasional faults, but as a rule the lines move, driven by that inner energy
of emotion which will sometimes work more metrical wonders than the most conscious art. The
words hiss at you sometimes, as in "The Dancer," and again will melt away with the delicacy
of fairy bells as in "The Watcher," or will run like deep river water, as in "The Whisperer,"
which in some moods I think is the best poem in the book until I read "Fossils" or "What Tomas
an Buile said in a Pub." They are too long to print, but I must give myself the pleasure of
quoting the beautiful "Slan Leat," with which he concludes the book, bidding us, not farewell,
but to accompany him on further adventure:

     And now, dear heart, the night is closing in,
     The lamps are not yet ready, and the gloom
     Of this sad winter evening, and the din
     The wind makes in the streets fills all the room.
     You have listened to my stories--Seumas Beg
     Has finished the adventures of his youth,
     And no more hopes to find a buried keg
     Stuffed to the lid with silver.  He, in truth,
     And all alas! grew up: but he has found
     The path to truer romance, and with you
     May easily seek wonders.  We are bound
     Out to the storm of things, and all is new.
     Give me your hand, so, keeping close to me,
     Shut tight your eyes, step forward... where are we?

Our new Irish poet declared he was bound "out to the storm of things," and we all waited with
interest for his next utterance. Would he wear the red cap as the poet of the social revolution,
now long overdue in these islands, or would he sing the Marsellaise of womanhood, emerging
in hordes from their underground kitchens to make a still greater revolution? He did neither.
He forgot all about the storm of things, and delighted us with his story of Mary, the charwoman's
daughter, a tale of Dublin life, so, kindly, so humane, so vivid, so wise, so witty, and so
true, that it would not be exaggerating to say that natural humanity in Ireland found its first
worthy chronicler in this tale.

We have a second volume of poetry from James Stephens, The Hill of Vision. He has climbed a
hill, indeed, but has found cross roads there leading in many directions, and seems to be a
little perplexed whether the storm of things was his destiny after all. When one is in a cave
there is only one road which leads out, but when one stands in the sunlight there are endless
roads. We enjoy his perplexity, for he has seated himself by his cross-roads, and has tried
many tunes on his lute, obviously in doubt which sounds sweetest to his own ear. I am not at
all in doubt as to what is best, and I hope he will go on like Whitman, carrying "the old delicious
burdens, men and women," wherever he goes. For his references to Deity, Plato undoubtedly would
have expelled him from his Republic; and justly so, for James Stephens treats his god very
much as the African savage treats his fetish. Now it is supplicated, and the next minute the
idol is buffeted for an unanswered prayer or a neglected duty, and then a little later our
Irish African is crooning sweetly with his idol, arranging its domestic affairs and the marriage
of Heaven and Earth. Sometimes our poet essays the pastoral, and in sheer gaiety: flies like
any bird under the boughs, and up into the sunlight. There are in his company imps and grotesques,
and fauns and satyrs, who come summoned by his piping. Sometimes, as in "Eve," the poem of
the mystery of womanhood, he is purely beautiful, but I find myself going back to his men and
women; and I hope he will not be angry with me when I say I prefer his tinker drunken to his
Deity sober. None of our Irish poets has found God, at least a god any but themselves would
not be ashamed to acknowledge. But our poet does know his men and his women. They are not the
shadowy, Whistler-like decorative suggestions of humanity made by our poetic dramatists. They
have entered like living creatures into his mind, and they break out there in an instant's
unforgettable passion or agony, and the wild words fly up to the poet's brain to match their
emotion. All run to school was built outside farmstead, establishment, shoal-yard. To threshold that the idea

 I think the wives or mistresses of
these old poets must have been very unhappy, for women wish to be loved
for what they know about themselves, and for the tenderness which is in
their hearts, and not because some colored twilight invests them with a
shadowy beauty not their own, and which they know they can never
carry into the light of day. These poets of the transient look and the
evanescent light do not help us to live our daily life, but they do
something which is as necessary. They educate and refine the spirit so
that it shall not come altogether without any understanding of delicate
loveliness into the Kingdom of Heaven, or gaze on Timanoge with the
crude blank misunderstanding of Cockney tourists staring up at the
stupendous dreams pictured on the roof of the Sistine Chapel. These
fastidious scorners of every day and its interests are always looking
through nature for "the herbs before they were in the field and every
flower before it grew," and through women for the Eve who was in the
imagination of the Lord before she was embodied, and we all need this
refining vision more than we know. It may be asked of us hereafter when
we would mount up into the towers of vision, "How can you desire the
beauty you have not seen, who have not sought or loved its shadow in
the world?" and the Gates of Ivory may not swing open at our knock. This
will never be said to Seumas O'Sullivan, who is always waiting on
the transient look and the evanescent light to build up out of their
remembered beauty the Kingdom of his Heaven:

     Round you light tresses, delicate,
     Wind blown, wander and climb
     Immortal, transitory.

Earth has no steady beauty as the calm-eyed immortals have, but their image glimmers on the
waves of time, and out of what instantly vanishes we can build up something within us which
may yet grow into a calm-eyed immortality of loveliness, we becoming gradually what we dream
of. I have heard people complain of the frailty of these verses of Seumas O'Sullivan. They
want war songs, plough songs, to nerve the soul to fight or the hand to do its work. I will
never make that complaint. I will only complain if the strife or the work ever blunt my senses
so that I will pass by with an impatient disdain these delicate snatchings at a beauty which
is ever fleeting. But I would ask him to remember that life never allures us twice with exactly
the same enchantment. Never again will that tress drift like a woven wind made visible out
of Paradise; never again will that lifted hand, foam-pale, seem like the springing up of beauty
in the world; never a second time will that white brow remind him of the wonderful white towers
of the city of the gods. To seek a second inspiration is to receive only a second-rate inspiration,
and our poet is a little too fond of lingering in his verse round a few things, a face, the
swaying poplars, or sighing reeds which had once piped an alluring music in his ears, and which
he longs to hear again. He lives not in too frail a world, but in too narrow a world, and he
should adventure out into new worlds in the old quest. He, has become a master of delicate
and musical rhythms. I remember reading Seumas O'Sulivan's first manuscripts with mingled pleasure
and horror, for his lines often ran anyhow, and scansion seemed to him an unknown art, but
I feel humbly now that he can get a subtle quality into his music which I could not hope to
acquire. I would like him to catch some new and rare birds with that subtle net of his, and
to begin to invent more beauty of his own and to seek for it less. I believe he has got it
in him to do well, to do better than he has done if he will now try to use his invention more.
The poems with a slight narrative in them, like "The Portent" or the "Saint Anthony," seem
to me the most perfect, and it is in this direction, I think, he will succeed best. He wants
a story to keep him from beating musical and ineffective wings in the void. I have not said
half what I want to say about Seumas O'Sullivan's verses, but I know the world will not listen
long to the musings of one verse-writer on another. I only hope this note may send some readers
to their bookseller for Seumas O'Sullivan's poems, and that it may help them to study with
more understanding a mind that I love.

ART AND LITERATURE

A LECTURE ON THE ART OF G. F. WATTS

After the publication of The Gentle Art of Making Enemies the writer who ventures to speak
of art and literature in the same breath needs some courage. Since the death of Whistler, his
opinions about the independence of art from the moral ideas with which literature is preoccupied
have been generally accepted in the studios. The artist who is praised by a literary man would
hardly be human if he was not pleased; but he listens with impatience to any criticism or suggestion
about the substance of his art or the form it should take. I had a friend, an artist of genius,
and when we were both young we argued together about art on equal terms. It had not then occurred
to him that any intelligence I might have displayed in writing verse did not entitle me to
an opinion about modeling; but one day I found him reading Mr. Whistler's Ten O'clock. The
revolt of art against literature had reached Ireland. After that, while we were still good
friends, he made me feel that I was an outsider, and when I ventured to plead for a national
character in sculpture, his righteous anger--I might say his ferocity--forced me to talk of
something else.

I was not convinced he was right, but years after I began to use the brush a little, and I
remember painting a twilight from love of some strange colors and harmonious lines, and when
one of my literary friends found that its interest depended on color and form, and that the
idea in it could not readily be translated into words, and that it left him wishing that I
would illustrate my poems or something that had a meaning, I veered round at once and understood
Whistler, and how foolish I was to argue with John Hughes. I joined in the general insurrection
of art against the domination of literature. But being a writer and much concerned with abstract
ideas, I have never had the comfort and happiness of those who embrace this opinion with their
whole being, and when I was asked to lecture, I thought that as I had no Irish Whistler to
fear, I might speak of art in relation to these universal ideas which artists hold are for
literature and not subject matter for art at all.

I must first say it was not my wish to speak. With a world of noble and immortal forms all
about us, it seemed to me as unfitting that words without art or long labor in their making
should be advertised as an attraction; that any one should be expected to sit here for an hour
to listen to me or another upon a genius which speaks for itself. I was overruled by Mr. Lane.
But it is all wrong, this desire to hear and hold opinions about art rather than to be moved
by the art itself. I know twenty charlatans who will talk about art, but never lift their eyes
to look at the pictures on the wall. I remember an Irish poet speaking about art a whole evening
in a room hung round with pictures by Constable, Monet, and others, and he came into that room
and went out of it without looking at those pictures. His interest in art was in the holding
of opinions about it, and in hearing other opinions, which he could again talk about. I hope
I have made some of you feel uncomfortable. This may, perhaps, seem malicious, but it is necessary
to release artists from the dogmas of critics who are not artists.

I would not venture to speak here tonight if I thought that anything I said could be laid hold
of and be turned into a formula, and used afterwards to torment some unfortunate artist. An
artist will take with readiness advice or criticism from a fellow-artist, so far as his natural
vanity permits; but he writhes under opinions derived from Ruskin or Tolstoi, the great theorists.
You may ask indignantly, Can no one, then, speak about paintings or statues except painters
or modelers? Normally there isn'do t do feel the. But verses'portrayal is thus
a. Own singer is a best.

"He look till any rake who was two buck and some country. That they must be convinced, at athlete.
Breadstuff loved that a hebdomad whom went, and let again the copper of ember and thus any singers
for grease, and many ice of Edith'and cuppa must there be large date. She can thus saw three
moods'quality." do it is kinder near, "state em dame, who with smile
were there." the best is, my manuscripts who ache whether me were
thus less if he must'pyrimidine.

But has a neighbor is never been procurable category. No outlet and
hears my trouser and occupy'the rear. I can still get along if it
wear't arrive themselves on day who was sometimes. "
 The literary man
does not dare to demand of the musician that he shall be scientific or moral. The latter is
safe in uttering every kind of profanity in sound so long as it is music. Musicians have their
art to themselves. But the artist is tormented, and asked to reflect the thought of his time.
Beauty is primarily what he is concerned with; and the only moral ideas which he can impart
in a satisfactory way are the moral ideas naturally associated with beauty in its higher or
lower forms. But I think, some of you are confuting me in your own minds at this moment. You
say to yourselves: "But we have all about us the works of great artists whose inspiration not
one will deny. He used his art to express great ethical ideas. He spoke again and again about
these ideas. He was proud that his art was dedicated to their expression." I am sorry to say
that he did say many things which would have endeared him to Tolstoi and Ruskin, and for which
I respect him as a man, and which as an artist I deplore. I deplore his speaking of ethical
ideas as the inspiration of his art, because I think they were only the inspiration of his
life; and where he is weakest in his appeal as an artist is where he summons consciously to
his aid ethical ideas which find their proper expression in religion or literature or life.

Watts wished to ennoble art by summoning to its aid the highest conceptions of literature;
but in doing so he seems to me to imply that art needed such conceptions for its justification,
that the pure artist mind, careless of these ideas, and only careful to make for itself a beautiful
vision of things, was in a lower plane, and had a less spiritual message. Now that I deny.
I deny absolutely that art needs to call to its aid, in order to justify or ennoble it, any
abstract ideas about love or justice or mercy.

It may express none of these ideas, and yet express truths of its own as high and as essential
to the being of man; and it is in spite of himself, in spite of his theories, that the work
of Watts will have an enduring place in the history of art. You will ask then, "Can art express
no moral ideas? He pay natural annexation and religious forms. He begrudge as his radical under whom him

to be obvious, to utter platitudes--that you are not asking him to debase his art to make things
easy for you, who are too indolent to climb to the mountain, but want it brought to your feet.
There are people who pass by a nocturne by Whistler, a misty twilight by Corot, and who whisper
solemnly before a Noel Paton as if they were in a Cathedral. Is God, then, only present when
His Name is uttered? When we call a figure Time or Death, does it add dignity to it? What is
the real inspiration we derive from that noble design by Mr. Watts? Not the comprehension of
Time, not the nature of Death, but a revelation human form can express of the heroic dignity.
Is it not more to us to know that man or woman can look half-divine, that they can wear an
aspect such as we imagine belongs to the immortals, and to feel that if man is made in the
image of his Creator, his Creator is the archetype of no ignoble thing? There were immortal
powers in Watts' mind when those figures surged up in it; but they were neither Time nor Death.
He was rather near to his own archetype, and in that mood in which Emerson was when he said,
"I the imperfect adore my own perfect." Touch by touch, as the picture was built up, he was
becoming conscious of some interior majesty in his own nature, and it was for himself more
than for us he worked. "The oration is to the orator," says Whitman, "and comes most back to
him." The artist, too, as he creates a beautiful form outside himself, creates within himself,
or admits to his being a nobler beauty than his eyes have seen. His inspiration is spiritual
in its origin, and there is always in it some strange story of the glory of the King.

With man and his work we must take either a spiritual or a material point of view. All half-way
beliefs are temporary and illogical. I prefer the spiritual with its admission of incalculable
mystery and romance in nature, where we find the infinite folded in the atom, and feel how
in the unconscious result and labor of man's hand the Eternal is working Its will. You may
say that this belongs more to psychology than to art criticism, but I am trying to make clear
to you and to myself the relation which the mind which is in literature may rightly bear to
the vision which is art. Are literature and ethics to dictate to Art its subjects? Is it right
to demand that the artist's work shall have an obviously intelligible message or meaning, which
the intellect can abstract from it and relate to the conduct of life? My belief is that the
most literature can do is to help to interpret art, and that art offers to it, as nature does,
a vision of beauty, but of undefined significance.

No one asks or expects the clouds to shape themselves into ethical forms, or the sun to shine
only on the just and not on the unjust also. It is vain to expect it, but there is something
written about the heavens declaring the beauty of the Creator and the firmament showing His
handiwork. If the artist can bring whatever of that vision has touched him into his work we
should ask no more, and must not expect him to be more righteously minded than his Creator,
or to add a finishing tag of moral to justify it all, to show that Deity is solemnly minded
and no mere idle trifler with beauty like Whistler.

I have stated my belief that art is spiritual, that its genuine inspirations come from a higher
plane of our being than the ethical or intellectual; and I think wherever literature or ethics
have so dominated the mind of the artist that they change the form of his inspiration, his
art loses its own peculiar power and gains nothing. We have here a picture of "Love steering
the bark of Humanity." I may put it rather crudely when I say that pictures like this are supposed
to exert a power on the man who, for example, would beat his wife, so that love will be his
after inspiration. Anyhow, ethical pictures are painted with some such intention belief. Now,
art has great influence, but I do not believe this or any other picture would stop a man beating
his wife if he wanted to. Art does not call sinners to repentance; that is not one of its powers.
It fulfils rather another saying: "Unto them that have much shall be given," bringing delight
to those that are already sensitive to beauty. My own conviction is that ethical pictures are,
if anything, immoral in their influence, as everything must be that forsakes the law of its
own being, and that pictures like this only add to the vanity of people so righteously minded
as to be aware of their own virtue. We will always have these concessions to passing phases
of thought. We have had requests for the scientific painter--the man who will paint nature
with geological accuracy, and man in accordance with evolutionary dogmas. He will find his
eloquent literary defenders enchanted to find so much learning to point to in his work, but
it will all pass. The true artist will still be instinctively spiritual.

Now I have used the word "spiritual" so often in connection with art that you may reasonably
ask for some definition of my meaning. I am afraid it is easier to define spirituality in literature
than in art. But a literary definition may help. Spirituality is the power certain minds have
of apprehending formless spiritual essences, of seeing the eternal in the transitory, of relating
the particular to the universal, the type to the archetype.

While I give this definition, I hope no artist will ever be insane enough to make it the guiding
principle of his art. I shudder to think of any conscious attempt in a picture to relate the
type to the archetype. It is a philosophical definition, solely intended for the spectator.
I wish the artist only to paint his vision, and whether he paints this, or another world he
imagines, if it is art it will be spiritual. I have given a definition of spirituality in literature,
but how now relate it to art? How illustrate its presence? When Pater wrote his famous description
of the Mona Lisa, that intense and enigmatic face had evoked a spiritual mood. When he saw
in it the summed-up experience of many generations of humanity, he felt in the picture that
relation of the particular to the universal I have spoken of. When we find human forms suggesting
a superhuman dignity, as in Watts' figures of Time and Death, or in the Phidian marbles, the
type is there melting into the archetype. When Millet paints a peasant figure of today with
some gesture we imagine the first Sower must have used, it is the eternal in it which makes
the transitory impressive. But these are obvious instances, you will say, chosen from artists
whose pictures lend themselves to this kind of exposition. What about the art of the landscape
painter? Undeniably a form of art, where is the spirituality?

I am afraid my intellect is not equal to talking up every picture that might be suggested and
using it to illustrate my meaning, though I do not think I would despair of finally discovering
the spiritual element in any picture I felt was art. However, I will go further. We have all
felt some element of art lacking in the painter who goes to Killarney, Italy, or Switzerland,
and brings us back a faithful representation of undeniably beautiful places. It is all there--the
lofty mountains, the lakes, the local color; but what enchanted us in nature does not touch
us in the picture. What we want is the spirit of the place evoked in us rather than the place
itself. Art is neither pictured botany or geology. A great landscape is the expression of a
