In the contemplation of facts like these it has been sometimes asked, whether a day will ever
arrive when the language spoken on this side of the Atlantic and on the other, will divide
into two languages, an old English and a new. We may confidently answer, No. Doubtless, if
those who went out from us to people and subdue a new continent, had left our shores two or
three centuries earlier than they did, when the language was very much farther removed from
that ideal after which it was unconsciously striving, and in which, once reached, it has in
great measure acquiesced; if they had not carried with them to their distant homes their English
Bible, and what else of worth had been already uttered in the English tongue; if, having once
left us, the intercourse between Old and New England had been entirely broken off, or only
rare and partial; there would then have unfolded themselves differences between the language
spoken here and there, which in tract of time accumulating and multiplying, might in the end
have justified the regarding of the languages as no longer one and the same. It could not have
failed but that such differences should have displayed themselves; for while there is a law
of necessity in the evolution of languages, while they pursue certain courses and in certain
directions, from which they can be no more turned aside by the will of men than one of the
heavenly bodies could be pushed from its orbit by any engines of ours, there is a law of liberty
no less; and this liberty must inevitably have made itself in many ways felt. In the political
and social condition of America, so far removed from our own, in the many natural objects which
are not the same with those which surround us here, in efforts independently carried out to
rid the language of imperfections, or to unfold its latent powers, even in the different effects
of soil and climate on the organs of speech, there would have been causes enough to have provoked
in the course of time not immaterial divergencies of language.

As it is, however, the joint operation of those three causes referred to already, namely, that
the separation did not take place in the infancy or youth of the language, but only in its
ripe manhood, that England and America owned a body of literature, to which they alike looked
up and appealed as containing the authoritative standards of the language, that the intercourse
between the one people and the other has been large and frequent, hereafter probably to be
larger and more frequent still, has effectually wrought. It has been strong enough so to traverse,
repress, and check all those causes which tended to divergence, that the written language of
educated men on both sides of the water remains precisely the same, their spoken manifesting
a few trivial differences of idiom; while even among those classes which do not consciously
acknowledge any ideal standard of language, there are scarcely greater differences, in some
respects far smaller, than exist between inhabitants of different provinces in this one island
of England; and in the future we may reasonably anticipate that these differences, so far from
multiplying, will rather diminish and disappear.

But I must return from this long digression. It seems often as if an almost unaccountable caprice
presided over the fortunes of words, and determined which should live and which die. Thus in
instances out of number a word lives on as a verb, but has ceased to be employed as a noun;
we say ‘to embarrass’, but no longer an ‘embarrass’; ‘to revile’, but not, with Chapman and
Milton, a ‘revile’; ‘to dispose’, but not a ‘dispose’{150}; ‘to retire’ but not a ‘retire’;
‘to wed’, but not a ‘wed’; we say ‘to infest’, but use no longer the adjective ‘infest’. Or
with a reversed fortune a word lives on as a noun, but has perished as a verb--thus as a noun
substantive, a ‘slug’, but no longer ‘to slug’ or render slothful; a ‘child’, but no longer
‘to child’, (“childing autumn”, Shakespeare); a ‘rape’, but not ‘to rape’ (South); a ‘rogue’,
but not ‘to rogue’; ‘malice’, but not ‘to malice’; a ‘path’, but not ‘to path’; or as a noun
adjective, ‘serene’, but not ‘to serene’, a beautiful word, which we have let go, as the French
have ‘sereiner’{151}; ‘meek’, but not ‘to meek’ (Wiclif); ‘fond’, but not ‘to fond’ (Dryden);
‘dead’, but not ‘to dead’; ‘intricate’, but ‘to intricate’ (Jeremy Taylor) no longer.
