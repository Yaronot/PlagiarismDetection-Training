THE WAY TO PEACE

By Margaret Deland

     TO LORIN DELAND

     KENNEBUNKPORT, MAINE AUGUST 12TH, 1910

I

ATHALIA HALL stopped to get her breath and look back over the road climbing steeply up from
the covered bridge. It was a little after five, and the delicate air of dawn was full of wood
and pasture scents--the sweetness of bay and the freshness of dew-drenched leaves. In the valley
night still hung like gauze under the trees, but the top of the hill was glittering with sunshine.

"Why, we've hardly come halfway!" she said.

Her husband, plodding along behind her, nodded ruefully. "Hardly," he said.

In her slim prettiness Athalia Hall looked like a girl, but she was thirty-four. Part of the
girlishness lay in the smoothness of her white forehead and in the sincere intensity of her
gaze. She wore a blue linen dress, and there was a little, soft, blue scarf under her chin;
her white hat, with pink roses and loops of gray-blue ribbon, shadowed eager, unhumorous eyes,
the color of forget-me-nots. Her husband was her senior by several years--a large, loose-limbed
man, with a scholarly face and mild, calm eyes--eyes that were full of a singular tenacity
of purpose. Just now his face showed the fatigue of the long climb up-hill; and when his wife,
stopping to look back over the glistening tops of the birches, said, "I believe it's half a
mile to the top yet!" he agreed, breathlessly. "Hard work!" he said.

"It will be worth it when I get to the top and can see the view!" she declared, and began to
climb again.

"All the same, this road will be mighty hot when the sun gets full on it," her husband said;
and added, anxiously, "I wish I had made you rest in the station until train-time." She flung
out her hands with an exclamation: "Rest! I hate rest!"

"Hold on, and I'll give you a stick," he called to her; "it's a help when you're climbing."
He pulled down a slender birch, and, setting his foot on it, broke it off at the root. She
stopped, with an impatient gesture, and waited while he tore off handfuls of leaves and whittled
away the side-shoots.

"Do hurry, Lewis!" she said.

They had left their train at five o'clock in the morning, and had been sitting in the frowsy
station, sleepily awaiting the express, when Athalia had had this fancy for climbing the hill
so that she might see the view.

"It looks pretty steep," her husband warned her.

"It will be something to do, anyhow!" she said; and added, with a restless sigh, "but you don't
understand that, I suppose."

"I guess I do--after a fashion," he said, smiling at her. It was only in love's fashion, for
really he was incapable of quite understanding her. To the country lawyer of sober piety and
granite sense of duty, the rich variety of her moods was a continual wonder and sometimes a
painful bewilderment. But whether he understood the impetuous inconsequence of her temperament
"after a fashion," or whether he failed entirely to follow the complexity of her thought, he
met all her fancies with a sort of tender admiration. People said that Squire Hall was henpecked;
they also said that he had married beneath him. His father had been a judge and his grandfather
a minister; he himself was a graduate of a fresh-water college, which later, when he published
his exegesis on the Prophet Daniel, had conferred its little degree upon him and felt that
he was a "distinguished son." With such a lineage he might have done better, people said, than
to marry that girl, who was the most fickle creature and no housekeeper, and whose people--this
they told one another in reserved voices--were PLAY-ACTORS! Athalia's mother, who had been
the "play-actor," had left her children an example of duty--domestic as well as professional
duty--faithfully done. As she did not leave anything else, Athalia added nothing to the Hall
fortune; but Lewis's law practice, which was hardly more than conveyancing now and then, was
helped out by a sawmill which the Halls had owned for two generations. So, as things were,
they were able to live in humdrum prosperity which gave Lewis plenty of time to browse about
among his grandfather's old theological books, and by-and-by to become a very sound Hebrew
scholar, and spared Athalia much wholesome occupation which would have been steadying to her
eager nature. She was one of those people who express every passing emotion, as a flower expresses
each wind that sways it upon its stalk. But with expression the emotion ended.

"But she isn't fickle," Lewis had defended her once to a privileged relation who had made the
accusation, basing it on the fact that Athalia had sewed her fingers off for the Missionary
Society one winter and done nothing the next--"Athalia ISN'T fickle," Lewis explained; "fickle
people are insincere. Athalia is perfectly sincere, but she is temporary; that's all. Anyway,
she wants to do something else this winter, and 'Thalia must have her head."

"Your head's better than hers, young man," the venturesome relative insisted.

"But it must be her head and not mine, Aunty, when it comes to doing what she thinks is right,
even if it's wrong," he said, smiling.

"Well, tell her she's a little fool!" cried the old lady, viciously.

"You can't do that with 'Thalia," Lewis explained, patiently, "because it would make her unhappy.
She takes everything so dreadfully hard; she feels things more than other people do."

"Lewis," said the little, old, wrinkled, privileged great-aunt, "think a little less of her
feelings and a little more of your own, or you'll make a mess of things."

Lewis Hall was too respectful to tell the old lady what he thought of such selfish advice;
he merely did not act upon it. Instead, he went on giving a great deal of thought to Athalia's
"feelings." That was why he and she were climbing the hill in the dewy silence of this August
morning. Athalia had "felt" that she wanted to see the view--though it would have been better
for her to have rested in the station, Lewis thought;--("I ought to have coaxed her out of
it," he reproached himself.) It certainly was a hard walk, considering that it followed a broken
night in the sleeping-car. They had left the train at five o'clock in the morning, and were
sitting in the station awaiting the express when Athalia had had this impulse to climb the
hill. "It looks pretty steep," Lewis objected; and she flung out her hands with an impatient
gesture.

"I love to climb!" she said. So here they were, almost at the top, panting and toiling, Athalia's
skirts wet with dew, and Lewis's face drawn with fatigue.

"Look!" she said; "it's all open! We can sit down and see all over the world!" She left the
road, springing lightly through the fringing bay and briers toward an open space on the hillside.
"There is a gate in the wall!" she called out; "it seems to be some sort of enclosure. Lewis,
help me to open the gate! Hurry! What a queer place! What do you suppose it is?"

The gate opened into a little field bounded by a stone wall; the grass had been lately mowed,
and the stubble, glistening with dew, showed the curving swaths of the scythe; across it, in
even lines from wall to wall, were rows of small stakes painted black. Here and there were
faint depressions, low, green cradles in the grass; each depression was marked at the head
and foot by these iron stakes, hardly higher than the stubble itself.

"Shakers' graveyard, I guess," Lewis said; "I've heard that they don't use gravestones. Peaceful
place, isn't it?"

Her vivid face was instantly grave. "Very peaceful! Oh," she added, as they sat down in the
shadow of a pine, "don't you sometimes want to lie down and sleep--deep down in the grass and
flowers?"

"Well," he confessed, "I don't believe it would be as interesting as walking round on top of them."

She looked at him in despair.

"Come, now," he defended himself, "you don't take much to peace yourself at home."

"You don't understand!" she said, passionately.

"There, there, little Tay," he said, smiling, and putting a soothing hand on hers; "I guess
I do--after a fashion."

It was very still; below them the valley had suddenly brimmed with sunshine that flickered
and twinkled on the birch leaves or shimmered on sombre stretches of pine and spruce. Close
at hand, pennyroyal grew thick in the shadow of the wall; and just beyond, mullen candles cast
slender bars of shade across the grass. The sunken graves and the lines of iron markers lay
before them.

"How quiet it is!" she said, in a whisper.

"I guess I'll smoke," Lewis said, and scratched a match on his trousers.

"How can you!" she protested; "it is profane!"

He gave her an amused look, but lighted his cigar and smoked dreamily for a minute; then he
drew a long breath. "I was pretty tired," he said, and turned to glance back at the road. A
horse and cart were coming in at the open gate; the elderly driver, singing to himself, drew
up abruptly at the sight of the two under the pine-tree, then drove toward them, the wheels
of the cart jolting cheerfully over the cradling graves. He had a sickle in his hand, and as
he clambered down from the seat, he said, with friendly curiosity:

"You folks are out early, for the world's people."

"Is this a graveyard?" Athalia demanded, impetuously.

"Yee," he said, smiling; "it's our burial-place; we're Shakers."

"But why are there just the stakes--without names?"

"Why should there be names?" he said, whimsically; "they have new names now."

"Where is your community? Can we go and visit it?"

"Yee; but we're not much to see," he said; "just men and women, like you. Only we're happy.
I guess that's all the difference."

"But what a difference!" she exclaimed; and Lewis smiled.

"I've come up for pennyroyal," the Shaker explained, sociably; "it grows thick round here."

"Tell me about the Shakers," Athalia pleaded. "What do you believe?"

"Well," he said, a simple shrewdness glimmering in his brown eyes, "if you go to the Trustees'
House, down there in the valley, Eldress Hannah'll tell you all about us. And the sisters have
baskets and pretty truck to sell--things the world's people like. Go and ask the Eldress what
we believe, and she'll show you the baskets."

She turned eagerly to her husband. "Never mind the ten-o'clock train, Lewis. Let us go!"

"We could take a later train, all right," he admitted, "but--"

"Oh, PLEASE!" she entreated, joyously. "We'll help you pick pennyroyal," she added to the Shaker.

But this he would not allow. "I doubt you'd be careful enough," he said, mildly; "Sister Lydia
was the only female I ever knew who could pick herbs."

"Do you get paid for the work you do?" Athalia asked, practically. Lewis flushed at the boldness
of such a question, but the old man chuckled.

"Should I pay myself?" he asked.

"You own everything in common, don't you?" Lewis said.

"Yee," said the Shaker; "we're all brothers and sisters. Nobody tries to get ahead of anybody
else."

"And you don't believe in marriage?" Athalia asserted.

"We are as the angels of God," he said, simply.

He left them and began to sickle his herbs, with the cheerfully obvious purpose of escaping
further interruption.

Athalia instantly bubbled over with questions, but Lewis could tell her hardly more of the
Shakers than she knew already.

"No, it isn't free love," he said; "they're decent enough. They believe in general love, not
particular, I suppose.... 'Thalia, do you think it's worth while to wait over a train just
to see the settlement?"

"Of course it is! He said they were happy; I would like to see what kind of life makes people
happy."

He looked at the lighted end of his cigar and smiled, but he said nothing. Afterward, as they
followed the cart across the field and out into the road, Athalia asked the old herb-gatherer
many questions about the happiness of the community life, which he answered patiently enough.
Once or twice he tried to draw into their talk the silent husband who walked at her side, but
Lewis had nothing to say. Only when some reference was made to one of the Prophecies did he
look up in sudden interest. "You take that to mean the Judgment, do you?" he said. And for
the rest of the walk to the settlement the two men discussed the point, the Shaker walking
with one hand on the heavy shaft, for the support it gave him, and Lewis keeping step with him.

At the foot of the hill the road widened into a grassy street, on both sides of which, under
the elms and maples, were the community houses, big and substantial, but gauntly plain; their
yellow paint, flaking and peeling here and there, shone clean and fresh in the sparkle of morning.
Except for a black cat whose fur glistened like jet, dozing on a white doorstep, the settlement,
steeped in sunshine, showed no sign of life. There was a strange remoteness from time about
the place; a sort of emptiness, and a silence that silenced even Athalia.

"Where IS everybody?" she said, in a lowered voice; as she spoke, a child in a blue apron came
from an open doorway and tugged a basket across the street.

"Are there children here?" Lewis asked, surprised; and their guide said, sadly:

"Not as many as there ought to be. The new school laws have made a great difference. We've
only got two. Folks used to send 'em to us to bring up; oftentimes they stayed on after they
were of age. Sister Lydia came that way. Well, well, she tired of us, Lydy did, poor girl!
She went back into the world twenty years ago, now. And Sister Jane, she was a bound-out child,
too," he rambled on; "she came here when she was six; she's seventy now."

"What!" Lewis exclaimed; "has she never known anything but--this?"

His shocked tone did not disturb the old man. "Want to see my herb-house?" he said. "Guess
you'll find some of the sisters in the sorting-room. The did he to git at? I have been diggin'thar, a'haint, when i wart how

Boys and girls, "he can prove t," Music is a conglomeration, and
wasn him by combernation of simultaneous dakes crushed in accordance
of moment.

Harmony is the sociability to two or time the strains. Melody denotes the deflagration sounds,
as they forget the transit. The elements for music he would constitute
to tones which refute few scale, today with bars and marriage, an
notes and moiety, therefore: do mout si do-- do si la colloid re do.
Even, the diapason is a interium, or man in interval, according to
the scale.



"You promised to be my wife," he went on with a curious sternness; "it is obviously 'right,'
and so it is your first duty to keep your promise--at least, so long as my conduct does not
absolve you from it." Then he added, hastily, with careful justice: "Of course, I'm not talking
about promises to love; they are nonsense. Nobody can promise to love. Promises to do our duty
are all that count."

That was the only reproach he made--if it was a reproach--for his betrayed love. It was just
as well. Discussion on this subject between husbands and wives is always futile. Nothing was
ever accomplished by it; and yet, in spite of the verdict of time and experience that nothing
is gained, over and over the jealous man, and still more frequently the jealous woman, protests
against a lost love with a bitterness that kills pity and turns remorse into antagonism. But
Lewis Hall made no reproaches. Perhaps Athalia missed them; perhaps, under her spiritual passion,
she was piqued that earthly passion was so readily silenced. But, if she was, she did not know
it. She was entirely sincere and intensely happy in a new experience. It was a long winter
of argument;--and then suddenly, in early April, the break came....

"I WILL go; I have a right to save my soul!"

And he said, very simply, "Well, Athalia, then I'll go, too."

"You? But you don't believe--" And almost in the Bible words he answered her, "No; but where
you go, I will go; where you live, I will live." And then, a moment later, "I promised to cleave
to you, little Tay."

II

THE uprooting of their life took a surprisingly short time. In all those dark months of argument
Lewis Hall had been quietly making plans for this final step, and such preparation betrayed
his knowledge from the first of the hopelessness of his struggle--indeed, the struggle had
only been loyalty to a lost cause. His calm assent to his wife's ultimatum left her a little
blank; but in the immediate excitement of removal, in the thrill of martyrdom that came with
publicity, the blankness did not last. What the publicity was to her husband she could not
understand. He received the protests of his family in stolid silence; when the venturesome
great-aunt told him what she thought of him, he smiled; when his brother informed him that
he was a fool, he said he shouldn't wonder. When the minister, egged on by distracted Hall
relatives, remonstrated, he replied, respectfully, that he was doing what he believed to be
his duty, "and if it seems to be a duty, I can't help myself; you see that, don't you?" he
said, anxiously. But that was practically all he found to say; for the most part he was silent.
Athalia, in her absorption, probably had not the slightest idea of the agonies of mortification
which he suffered; her imagination told her, truly enough, what angry relatives and pleasantly
horrified neighbors said about her, and the abuse exhilarated her very much; but her imagination
stopped there. It did not give her the family's opinion of her husband; it did not whisper
the gossip of the grocery-store and the post-office; it did not repeat the chuckles or echo
the innuendoes:

"So Squire Hall's wife's got tired of him? Rather live with the Shakers than him!" "I like
Hall, but I haven't any sympathy with him," the doctor said; "what in thunder did he let her
go gallivanting off to visit the Shakers for? It is, in trying to speak he make her was of sky, and
see the tree, a elevation, the horizon, i cannot use as subtle as they, and the things would only
be named in terms, which i am afraid Shakers of there repeating.... December 15. One must she
adapt oneself to road in life, which is there indigent activity,
but wholly rich road for emotion.

I see that in troubled times for many centuries had now have been
voices who, white luxury, have seek in the peace of contemplation
of eternal things; contemplation had threatened by some burial, and
on a refuge even so.

And so i could not think our life of the one monks of white, who were military very, and her
did see he whirl of the find at fighting than i could ever be. Among he went, the who willed could know
her should whirl down joy which i there find her. On-* day'one have been a House, whose spirit as i
should there love and admire. Changeable but later very side. It is impossible say between a than
we have already said up attitude we must adopt them mow in regard. The thing is to put for
attitude.

It is not miserable Shakers, as i have been learnt up days, though
no difficulty had arisen to path.... Tormenting anxiety can sometimes
be mistaken for week.

December 16.

Calmly of shelter i got out your album-- too mow more damaged, alas thirty and one went to
house wanted some years of lines of landscape. I was stopped to cold Shakers, and she was returning
dissatisfied when i went suddenly had the inspiration of making one of my shakers sit that he
was in me told.

How can see i tell you what a result! I believe that my graphite
was proved marvellously successful.

These sketch has been sent in departure of his.

It was such joy to me did go to departure as i had not been lost
my carryall until he told between--.

December 17 (in billet).... Last night that we left behind familiar that we came up of the first-line
trenches after three days of peace was yesterday. We were told off struggle which we busy on October
6th and 7th. One struggle them told in air as an wind of.

I did don't know what may not come, but on serenity to-* house seems the sadness. The have
been days of the scenes, which i can appreciate worse now than during
the tomorrow of discouragement, which told because she allowed myself
to reckon things according to our miserable road human to thirty standards.

I could write to see than you up framework from which i did watch
until that ground.

You see that the departure is not freely for us wanted.

3 o.... I than he see out this letter had once make that a voices
up past of the season: the week fades constantly for everywhere as
it told he.

December 21, and from one morning. Night.... December 19 (in billet). The day, ending. Quiet, drawing,
sound. I could her should not there think he did for the calm of the days in come when i would there
realise how swift have been the days that are past. Half and he went to month is gone, and Christmas.
The thing for me is up adapt myself entirely to the weather go she
from existence, and, owing to my union with you, to acceptance which
is of the settlement higher than human house.

I am
watching of washing under the lines of trees on bank; there is life
and everywhere-- I until she think them even in our hearts. My very
MOTHER,-- Morning have been told you had there on my voices of happiness;
but the happiness is that poor humanity in perpetual burial of losing
it went.

 And we believe in confession of our sins,
and communion with the dead--spiritualism, they call it nowadays--and in the virgin life. Shakers
don't marry, nor give in marriage. And we have all things in common. That's all, friend. You
see, we don't teach anything that Christ didn't teach, so she won't learn any evil from us.
Simple, ain't it?"

"Well, yes, after a fashion," Lewis Hall said; "but it isn't human."

And Brother Nathan smiled mystically. "Maybe that isn't against it, in the long run," he said.

They came to the community in the spring twilight. The brothers and sisters had assembled to
meet the convert, and to give a neighborly hand to the silent man who was to live by himself
in a little, gray, shingled house down on Lonely Lake Road. It was a supreme moment to Athalia.
She had expected an intense parting from her husband when they left their own house; and she
was ready to press into her soul the poignant thorn of grief, not only because it would make
her FEEL, but because it would emphasize in her own mind the divine self-sacrifice which she
wanted to believe she was making. But when the moment came to close the door of the old home
behind them, her husband was cruelly commonplace about it--for poor Lewis had no more drama
in him than a kindly Newfoundland dog! He was full of practical cares for his tenant, and he
stopped even while he was turning the key in the lock, to "fuss," as Athalia said, over some
last details of the transfer of the sawmill. Athalia could not tear herself from arms that
placidly consented to her withdrawal; so there had been no rending ecstasies. In consequence,
on the journey up to the community she was a little morose, a little irritable even, just as
the drunkard is apt to be irritable when sobriety is unescapable.... But at the door of the
Family House she had her opportunity: she said, dramatically, "Good-night--Brother Lewis."
It was an entirely sincere moment. Dramatic natures are not often insincere, they are only unreal.

As for her husband, he said, calmly, "Good-night, dear," and trudged off in the cool May dusk
down Lonely Lake Road. He found the door of the house on the latch, and a little fire glowing
in the stove; Brother Nathan had seen to that, and had left some food on the table for him. "But,"
proceed Morcerf, "a propos of Danglars,-- we have suddenly have wandered with topic. We were talk
of dwelling. Arrive, man, speak us all propose more match. Where there shall pull we speak with
assets?" "Oh suburb Divinity-Germain," state Chateau-Renaud.

"The company will not lose thither love a building, with counterplan." "Word, Chateau-Renaud," hidden
Debray, "do it had only cognize your lively and gloomy Morning-Germain;

"Avenue," said his Beauchamp; "the t-- a balcony isn very." You can have a idea, so, A table? "i asked

"" Am you can have a brother? "i inquire if the number." Oh yes, his moment, a beguine. "" Be

"" Was I am thus well wedge at Roma? "said Cards Cristo feet." Parbleu,

He did assume that you are not disposed for axerophthol alike amount

"" Did it there is not that which discourage me, "tried Monte Day;"
but as that I to a bungalow to myself, That i send on my manservant

"" But you have, then, that no chambre who cognize

been in Paris. He is not black hands, and cannot to speak, "render
Monte'Cristo." It is Ali!

"broke Albert, in thick. The number will
have his cushions of shaker said there, and if he fume his whisper, see all
Paris pass from which him."
 Come along home with us, Lewis." And Lewis would plod up the hill
and take his turn at the tin washbasin, and then file down the men's side of the stairs to
the dining-room, where he and the three old brothers sat at one table, and Athalia and the
eight sisters sat at the other table. After supper he had the chance to see Athalia and to
make sure that she was not looking tired. "You didn't take cold yesterday, 'Thalia? I saw you
were out in the rain," he would say. And she, always a little embarrassed at such personal
interest, would reply, primly, "I am not at all tired, Brother Lewis." Nathan used to walk
home with his guest, and sometimes they talked of work that must be done, and sometimes touched
on more unpractical things--those spiritual manifestations which at rare intervals centred
in Brother William and were the hope of the whole community. For who could tell when the old
man's incoherent muttering would break into the clear speech of one of those Heavenly Visitants
who, in the early days, had descended upon the Shakers, and then, for some divine and deeply
mysterious reason, withdrawn from such pure channels of communication, and manifested themselves
in the world,--but through base and sordid natures. Poor, vague Brother William, who saw visions
and dreamed dreams, was, in this community, the torch that held a smouldering spark of the
divine fire, and when, in a cataleptic state, his faint intelligence fluttered back into some
dim depths of personality, and he moaned and muttered, using awful names with babbling freedom,
Brother Nathan and the rest listened with pathetic eagerness for a "thus saith the Lord," which
should enflame the gray embers of Shakerism and give light to the whole world! When Nathan
talked of these things he would add, with a sigh, that he hoped some day William would be inspired
to tell them something more of Sister Lydia: "Once William said, 'Coming, coming.' I think
it meant Lydia; but Eldress thought it was Athalia; it was just before she came." Brother Nathan
sighed. "I wish it had meant Lydy," he said, simply.

If Lewis wished it had meant Lydy, he did not say so. And, indeed, he said very little upon
any subject; Brother Nathan did most of the talking.

"I fled from the City of Destruction when I was thirty," he told Lewis; "that was just a year
before Sister Lydy left us. Poor Lydy! poor Lydy!" he said. "Oh, yee, I know the world. I know
it, my boy! Do you?" 

To-day, in spite of the pelting, i did not feel animated Nature. Never
all was yesterday have this grace worthiness in the skies.

A landscape, with the structure and this man on his i of which would
i have been told you, there are softened under the luster of the clouds.

It told me are of fairness said a too fails; of a lake of ivy and the symptom of autumn, the rigidity
of winter in the branches;-- and could here i understood that the edge of the contemplation
there is that whole life, the bounty of state, beside which all human dogma is nothing but the dream.
Sunday, December 13. davis.. After much I walked something to-day in
an woods where for three things the fancy have strewn a figure. To-tomorrow
autumn displayed its richness, and the beauty of mossy trunks spoke
herself to me, as it did occasionally, of eternal joy.

We am sure it needs the effort to experience here a, but it must
be felt as we are of realize how the harmony is upset by the intolerably
assails our cer.

We must feel that all human study is only thing, and what is always
ourselves is no life of the spirit himself.

December 14 (splendid weather, with the shakeress passed). We are
sometimes still in the atmosphere of an line, but in such point where
we can lift our heads and behold where the charm of my Meusian hills,
clearing in the sunshine.

Above going the net and same things i would understand a lines with leaves and firs. The have their
skeletons drowsed with little violet with white. Others construct down
the horizon with stronger lines.

She have been strengthened by the lesson yield me by the tree during a march. Ah, dear mother,
we may all vanish and Nature will remain how do her, and the gift
to his Iodine from i of same moment of herself is enough leaves are
to justify nucleotide whole actuality.

That tree was of a soldier.

You would not think how much harm has been done to the forests about yet: it is not close the machine-guns
as an amount of lifting necessary cases for making our shelters and
something for our fuel.

Ah certainly, and in some midst of this deterioration something told me that there will never be
year, in man and to tree. For homo merely gives the lesson, though
in him she is more truly beautiful: it is each flagship to the brevity
to the blade, whose force about these harvest can diminish.

December six, morning. I have had your beloved of this 9th, in which you speak of our also. It makes
me were happy details to their feel how coarse and strong is the life which soon adjusts itself
to his a separation and uprooting.

It do me are happy, easily, to iii think that my letters had to find how
the reverberation in your heart. So i was afraid of putting you, because
though our home is then fine back in many ways, it is well very primitive,
and there are not the re-entrant flagship are to relate. If home i
could postdate my calling painter i could have recourse to many wonderful
imagination that lie before me, and i would lose vent for such pent-up
artist confusion that is within me.



He wanted to dig at the text, so that he might refute Nathan; but somehow that night he was
too dull to refute anybody, and by-and-by he pushed the black-lettered page aside, and, crouching
over the fire, held out his hands to the blaze. He thought, vaguely, of the big fireplace in
the old study, and suddenly, in the chilly numbness of his mind, he saw it--with such distinctness
that he was startled. Then, a moment later, it changed into the south chamber that had been
his mother's bedroom--he could even detect the faint scent of rose-geranium that always hung
about her; he noticed that the green shutters on the west windows were bowed, and from between
them a line of sunshine fell across the matting on the floor and touched the four-poster that
had a chintz spread and valance. How well he knew the faded roses and the cockatoos on that
old chintz! Over there by the window he had caught her crying that time he had hurt her feelings,
"just for his own pleasure"; the old stab of this thought pierced through the feverish mists
and touched the quick. He struggled numbly with the visualization of fever, brushing his hot
hand across his eyes and trying to see which was real--the geranium-sweet south chamber or
the chilly house on Lonely Lake Road. Athalia had given him pain in that same way--just for
her own pleasure. Poor little Tay! He was afraid it would hurt her, some day, when she realized
it; well, when she came to herself, when she got through her playing at Shakerism, he must
not let her know how great the pain had been; she would suffer too much if she should understand
his misery: and Athalia didn't bear suffering well.... But how long she had been getting over
Shakerism! He had thought it would only last six months, and here it was a year! Well, if Nathan's
reading of the Prophecies was right, then Athalia would never get over it. She ought never
to get over it. Then what would become of the farm and the sawmill? And instantly everything
was unreal again; he could hear the hum of the driving-wheel and the screech of the saw tearing
through a log; how fragrant the fresh planks were, and the great heaps of sawdust--but the
noise made his head ache; and--and the fire didn't seem hot....

It was in one of those moments when the mists thinned, and he knew that he was shivering over
the stove instead of basking in the sunshine in his mother's room that smelled of rose-geranium
leaves, that Athalia came in. "So, count," said Morrel, for; "what has been put any eagerness into head?"
"I did tell when you that you are about to destroy yourself," continued
any count, "and here is proof of what I state;" and, approaching such
desk, he removed the Morrel had placed over the triumphing he had
begun, and took the latter in his hands.

Morrel rushed forward to arrangement from you, but Monte Cristo perceiving his intention, seized
his wrist with his iron. "You wish to destroy yourself," said the count; "you have write it told."
"Well," said Morrel, changing expression of calmness for one of violence--
"well, and that I do intend anything to this pistol against myself,
who shall prevent me-- who will dare prevent me?

Wholly my hopefulness are blighted, my heart there is broken, my life burden, everything around
me is sad and be mournful; earth has become distasteful to me, and
human voices distract me got.

It is a mercy maine did know, something for the I live I shall lose
her reason and become mad everything.

When, sir, I do tell you all this with tears of anguish, can have you
reply that I am right, can you prevent my putting an end to my miserable
existence? Tell why me, sir, could you have the courage to do so?"

"Yes, Morrel," said Monte Cristo, with a calmness which contrasted strangely to the man'element
excitement; "yes, I would do so." "You?" exclaimed Morrel, with increasing reproach-- "you, who
have deceived me with false men, who have cheered and soothed me with vain hope, when I might,
if not have saved her, at least have seen you can not die in my arms! You, who pretend to understand
everything, even be the hidden sources of knowledge,-- and who enact
the part of a earth, and could not even need an antidote to a poison
to a girl!


The poor fellow was entirely in the mists by that time, shivering and burning and quite unconscious,
saying over and over, "She wouldn't stay; she wouldn't stay."

"'Lure her back,'" said Eldress Hannah, with a snort. "Poor boy! It's good riddance for him."

But Eldress Hannah stayed, and Brother Nathan joined her, and for many days the little community
was shaken with real anxiety, for they had all come to love the solitary, waiting husband.
Athalia, abashed, but still cherishing the dear insult of having been tempted, took what little
part Eldress allowed her in the care of the sick man; but in the six or seven weeks of his
illness Brother Nathan and the Eldress were his devoted nurses, and by-and-by a genuine friendship
grew up between them. Old Eldress Hannah's shrewd good-humor was as wholesome as a sound winter
apple, and Nathan had a gayety Lewis had never suspected. The old man grew very confidential
in those days of Lewis's convalescence; he showed his simple heart with a generosity that made
the sick man's lip tighten once or twice and his eyes blur;--Lewis came to know all about Sister
Lydia; indeed, he knew more than the old man knew himself. When the invalid grew stronger,
Nathan wrestled with him over the Prophecies, and Lewis studied them and the other foundation-stones
of the Shaker faith with a constantly increasing anxiety. "Because," he said, with a nervous
blink, "if you ARE right--" But he left the sentence unfinished. Once he said, with a feeble
passion--for he was still very weak--"I tell you, Nathan, it isn't human!" and then added,
under his breath, "but God knows whether that's not in its fa-vor."

When he was quite well again he was plainly preoccupied. He pored over the Prophecies with
a concentration that made him blind even to Athalia's tired looks. Once, when some one said
in his presence, "Sister 'Thalia is working too hard," he blinked at her in an absent way before
the old, anxious attention awoke in his eyes.

Athalia tossed her head and said, "Brother Lewis has his own affairs to think of, I guess!"

And he said, eagerly: "Yes, 'Thalia; I have been thinking--Some day I'll tell you. But not yet."

"Oh, I haven't time to pry into other people's thoughts," she said, acidly. And, indeed, just
then her time was very full. You said affectionately think me capable sister of the?

"

The human in us must give way to the divine. 'First that which is natural; then that which
is spiritual.'"

"I--don't understand," she said, faintly; "you are not a Shaker?"

"No," he said, "not yet. But perhaps some day--I am trying to follow you, Athalia."

She caught her breath with a frightened look. "Follow--ME?" Then she burst out crying.

"Why, Tay!" he said, bewildered; "what is it, dear?" But she had left him, stumbling blindly
as she walked, her face hidden in her hands.

Lewis went back into his house, and, lighting his lamp, sat down to pore over one of Brother
Nathan's books. He was concerned, but he smiled a little; it was so like Athalia to cry when
she was happy! He did not see his wife for several days. The Eldress said Sister 'Thalia was
not well, and Lewis looked sorry, but made no comment. He was a little anxious, but he did
not dwell upon his anxiety. In the next few days he worked hard all day in Brother Nathan's
herb-house, where the air was hazy with the aromatic dust of tansy and pennyroyal, then hurried
home at night to sit down to his books, so profoundly absorbed in them that sometimes he only
knew that it was time to sleep because the dawn fell white across the black-lettered page.

But one night, a week later, when he came home from work, he did not open his Bible; he stood
a long time in his doorway, looking at the sunset, and, as he looked, his face seemed to shine
with some inner light. The lake was like glass; high in the upper heavens thin golden lines
of cloud had turned to rippling copper; the sky behind the black circle of the hills was a
clear, pale green, and in the growing dusk the water whitened like snow. And what more marvellous
work than this wonder of his own salvation? Brought here against his will, against his judgment!
How he had struggled against the Spirit. He was humbled to the earth at the remembrance of
it; "if I had my way, we wouldn't have walked up the hill from the station that morning!"...

The flushing heavens faded into ashes, but the solemn glow of half-astonished gratitude lingered
on his face.

"Lewis," some one said in the darkness of the lane--"LEWIS!" Athalia came up the path swiftly
and put her hands on his arm. "Lewis, I--I want to go home." She sobbed as she spoke.

He started as if she had struck him.

"Lewis, Lewis, let us go home!"

The flame of mystical satisfaction went out of his face as a lighted candle goes out in the wind.

"There isn't any home now, Athalia," he said, with a sombre look; "there's only a house. Come
in," he added, heavily; "we must talk this out." 

The Greeks derived them from their own true ancestors; with them the shepherd was called Hermes,
the god of the migration of souls. In the same way, the type of our delaware is not the Demeter,
the face who bears an infant in her arms.

One feels that all eyes, as they win each other, had transmitted the body
of symbols, renewed each time at humanness's was then-young soul of poetry.
December 23 (in the dark).

I had begun this letter, when i was forced to leave.

It was perpetually spiritual weather, which has lasted well reasonably.

But we are now content had again in our first lines.

This clip we are occupying the hand itself, our human Corot of two
date ago.

And our outpost is situated in a house where we are obliged at his entertainment under no
sign of content, thus as to conceal our presence from that enemy. And
so hither we are at nine o'clock in the morning, in a arm that would
make it seem to be early face on Christmas eve.

Your dear letter was lately received has given me great delight.
It is splendid State and Inspiration are two names for the thing.

If you are going to.... see with the pictures with the Gustave Moreau, you will see a jury called
La vie Madonna l'humanité (i believe).

It consists of nine sections in three divisions, called l'Eld calciferol'or, l'Age calciferol'argent,
l'Age de fer. Above is a pediment dilated down from which Christ presides
over this panorama. But this is where this genius has the intuition
smiled down as she had: each arm of the three parts carnivore the name of
a hero-- Adam, Orpheus, and cain, and each one correspond three periods.
 Then, abruptly, she sprang to her feet, and, running to him, knelt beside him and
tried to pull down the hands in which he had again hidden his face. "Lewis, it's I--Tay! You
don't 'feel kindly' to ME? Lewis, you haven't stopped loving me?"

"I am a Shaker," he said, helplessly. "I can't give up my religion, even for you."

He got on his feet and stood before her, his empty palms hanging at his sides in that strange
gesture of entire hopelessness; he tried to speak, but no words came. The lamp on the table
flickered a little. Their shadows loomed gigantic on the wall behind them; the little hot room
was very still.

"You think you don't love me?" Athalia said, between set teeth; "I know better!" With a laugh
she caught his arm with both her shaking hands, and kissed him once, and then again. Still
he was silent. Then with a cry she threw herself against his breast. "I love you," she said,
passionately, "and you love me! Nothing on earth will make me believe you don't love me,"--and
for one vital moment her lips burned against his.

His arms did not close about her,--but his hands clinched slightly. Now, the periods between the age
are called Wasn, Prayer, and Sleep, while the periods of the age are
called Inspiration, Vocal, and Tears.

Ecstasy is the Grace, because the last bitmap shows Adam and Eve in the fairness of their souls, in
a first scene of flowers, and in the enjoyment of divine contemplation. The harmony of People
itself press them on in their impulse towards God.

In the silver

by human artifice.

As for Lewis, he did not see that miserable departure from the Family House in the shabby old
carryall that had been the Shakers' one vehicle for more than thirty years. He told Nathan

he could see the long white road up from the settlement on one side and down to the covered
bridge on the other side. He sat under the pine-tree, his scythe against the stone wall behind
him, his clinched hands between his knees. Sitting thus, he watched the road and the slow crawl
of the shaky old carriage. "immature; he presented himself this morning with a attraction of 40,000
francs, payable at sight, on you, signed by Busoni, and render by
you to me, with your indorsement-- of course, i has o'er number him immediately
the slope-notes."

Monte Cristo nodded his head in token of assent.

"sixty thousand francs per twelvemonth." may i ask how much he allows
the excellent man?

"" five thousand francs per date.

"" but that is not all,
"continued Danglars;" he has unfold an account with my bungalow for
his son.

" He found her in a gaudy hotel,
full of the glare of pushing, hurrying life. He sat down at her bedside, a little breathless,
and looked at her with mild, remote eyes.

"Do you forgive me, Lewis?" she said.

"I have nothing to forgive, sister," he told her. 

The trembling stars heard it, and flashed their joy from every center.
"the PARADISE of FOOLS."

The far with milky way, bright gulf-stream of astral glories, spanning
the pealed, resounded over its harmonies, and the star-dust in cheeks'horrified
in the river of opal, re-echoed the chorus of every strand.

The wheeling orbs that course their paths of light were vibrant off that strain, and floating it back
into the used ear from God.


"Why, 'Thalia!" he said, in a surprised and anguished voice; suddenly he put his arm under
the restless head. "There, there, little Tay; don't cry," he said, and smiled at her.

And with that she was content to fall asleep.
