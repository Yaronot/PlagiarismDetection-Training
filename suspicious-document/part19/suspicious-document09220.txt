Dear Phillips, Yours always, J. MELFORD

To Dr LEWIS. BATH, April 23. DEAR DOCTOR,

If I did not know that the exercise of your profession has habituated you to the hearing of
complaints, I should make a conscience of troubling you with my correspondence, which may be
truly called the lamentations of Matthew Bramble. Yet I cannot help thinking I have some right
to discharge the overflowings of my spleen upon you, whose province it is to remove those disorders
that occasioned it; and let me tell you, it is no small alleviation of my grievances, that
I have a sensible friend, to whom I can communicate my crusty humours, which, by retention,
would grow intolerably acrimonious.

You must know, I find nothing but disappointment at Bath; which is so altered, that I can scarce
believe it is the same place that I frequented about thirty years ago. Methinks I hear you
say, 'Altered it is, without all doubt: but then it is altered for the better; a truth which,
perhaps, you would own without hesitation, if you yourself was not altered for the worse.'
The reflection may, for aught I know, be just. The inconveniences which I overlooked in the
high-day of health, will naturally strike with exaggerated impression on the irritable nerves
of an invalid, surprised by premature old age, and shattered with long-suffering -- But, I
believe, you will not deny, that this place, which Nature and Providence seem to have intended
as a resource from distemper and disquiet, is become the very centre of racket and dissipation.
Instead of that peace, tranquillity, and case, so necessary to those who labour under bad health,
weak nerves, and irregular spirits; here we have nothing but noise, tumult, and hurry; with
the fatigue and slavery of maintaining a ceremonial, more stiff, formal, and oppressive, than
the etiquette of a German elector. A national hospital it may be, but one would imagine that
none but lunatics are admitted; and truly, I will give you leave to call me so, if I stay much
longer at Bath. -- But I shall take another opportunity to explain my sentiments at greater
length on this subject -- I was impatient to see the boasted improvements in architecture,
for which the upper parts of the town have been so much celebrated and t'other day I made a
circuit of all the new buildings. The Square, though irregular, is, on the whole, pretty well
laid out, spacious, open, and airy; and, in my opinion, by far the most wholesome and agreeable
situation in Bath, especially the upper side of it; but the avenues to it are mean, dirty,
dangerous, and indirect. Its communication with the Baths, is through the yard of an inn, where
the poor trembling valetudinarian is carried in a chair, betwixt the heels of a double row
of horses, wincing under the curry-combs of grooms and postilions, over and above the hazard
of being obstructed, or overturned by the carriages which are continually making their exit
or their entrance -- I suppose after some chairmen shall have been maimed, and a few lives
lost by those accidents, the corporation will think, in earnest, about providing a more safe
and commodious passage. The Circus is a pretty bauble, contrived for shew, and looks like Vespasian's
amphitheatre turned outside in. If we consider it in point of magnificence, the great number
of small doors belonging to the separate houses, the inconsiderable height of the different
orders, the affected ornaments of the architrave, which are both childish and misplaced, and
the areas projecting into the street, surrounded with iron rails, destroy a good part of its
effect upon the eye; and, perhaps, we shall find it still more defective, if we view it in
the light of convenience. The figure of each separate dwelling-house, being the segment of
a circle, must spoil the symmetry of the rooms, by contracting them towards the street windows,
and leaving a larger sweep in the space behind. If, instead of the areas and iron rails, which
seem to be of very little use, there had been a corridore with arcades all round, as in Covent-garden,
the appearance of the whole would have been more magnificent and striking; those arcades would
have afforded an agreeable covered walk, and sheltered the poor chairmen and their carriages
from the rain, which is here almost perpetual. At present, the chairs stand soaking in the
open street, from morning to night, till they become so many boxes of wet leather, for the
benefit of the gouty and rheumatic, who are transported in them from place to place. Indeed
this is a shocking inconvenience that extends over the whole city; and, I am persuaded, it
produces infinite mischief to the delicate and infirm; even the close chairs, contrived for
the sick, by standing in the open air, have their frize linings impregnated like so many spunges,
with the moisture of the atmosphere, and those cases of cold vapour must give a charming check
to the perspiration of a patient, piping hot from the Bath, with all his pores wide open.

But, to return to the Circus; it is inconvenient from its situation, at so great a distance
from all the markets, baths, and places of public entertainment. The only entrance to it, through
Gay-street, is so difficult, steep, and slippery, that in wet weather, it must be exceedingly
dangerous, both for those that ride in carriages, and those that walk a-foot; and when the
street is covered with snow, as it was for fifteen days successively this very winter, I don't
see how any individual could go either up or down, without the most imminent hazard of broken
bones. In blowing weather, I am told, most of the houses in this hill are smothered with smoke,
forced down the chimneys, by the gusts of wind reverberated from the hill behind, which (I
apprehend likewise) must render the atmosphere here more humid and unwholesome than it is in
the square below; for the clouds, formed by the constant evaporation from the baths and rivers
in the bottom, will, in their ascent this way, be first attracted and detained by the hill
that rises close behind the Circus, and load the air with a perpetual succession of vapours:
this point, however, may be easily ascertained by means of an hygrometer, or a paper of salt
of tartar exposed to the action of the atmosphere. The same artist who planned the Circus,
has likewise projected a Crescent; when that is finished, we shall probably have a Star; and
those who are living thirty years hence, may, perhaps, see all the signs of the Zodiac exhibited
in architecture at Bath. These, however fantastical, are still designs that denote some ingenuity
and knowledge in the architect; but the rage of building has laid hold on such a number of
adventurers, that one sees new houses starting up in every out-let and every corner of Bath;
contrived without judgment, executed without solidity, and stuck together with so little regard
to plan and propriety, that the different lines of the new rows and buildings interfere with,
and intersect one another in every different angle of conjunction. They look like the wreck
of streets and squares disjointed by an earthquake, which hath broken the ground into a variety
of holes and hillocks; or as if some Gothic devil had stuffed them altogether in a bag, and
left them to stand higgledy piggledy, just as chance directed. What sort of a monster Bath
will become in a few years, with those growing excrescences, may be easily conceived: but the
want of beauty and proportion is not the worst effect of these new mansions; they are built
so slight, with the soft crumbling stone found in this neighbourhood, that I shall never sleep
quietly in one of them, when it blowed (as the sailors say) a cap-full of wind; and, I am persuaded,
that my hind, Roger Williams, or any man of equal strength, would be able to push his foot
through the strongest part of their walls, without any great exertion of his muscles. All these
absurdities arise from the general tide of luxury, which hath overspread the nation, and swept
away all, even the very dregs of the people. Every upstart of fortune, harnessed in the trappings
of the mode, presents himself at Bath, as in the very focus of observation -- Clerks and factors
from the East Indies, loaded with the spoil of plundered provinces; planters, negro-drivers,
and hucksters from our American plantations, enriched they know not how; agents, commissaries,
and contractors, who have fattened, in two successive wars, on the blood of the nation; usurers,
brokers, and jobbers of every kind; men of low birth, and no breeding, have found themselves
suddenly translated into a state of affluence, unknown to former ages; and no wonder that their
brains should be intoxicated with pride, vanity, and presumption. Knowing no other criterion
of greatness, but the ostentation of wealth, they discharge their affluence without taste or
conduct, through every channel of the most absurd extravagance; and all of them hurry to Bath,
because here, without any further qualification, they can mingle with the princes and nobles
of the land. Even the wives and daughters of low tradesmen, who, like shovel-nosed sharks,
prey upon the blubber of those uncouth whales of fortune, are infected with the same rage of
displaying their importance; and the slightest indisposition serves them for a pretext to insist
upon being conveyed to Bath, where they may hobble country-dances and cotillons among lordlings,
squires, counsellors, and clergy. Her are a red Gildippe. From her recollect it was a mistress who was, and
that we had better keep herself into a win, fire was not out.'i wan serenely but you win to hysterics!'and
as she had mine son with they took, and it made to duty or they could

was not cruel as the tears for harm who could come to what do us took,
and when she sent Assafoetida, and with Nicolas, who had come to light.'oh,

I laugh herself to think. de, and find that the toilet, and in which her had but success, for

even, home, Curtsies could be left without mistress, any clothes who save
what had been cower on drops who fear her was in haste, love, we
knew from St. Complexion into ghost, no preparations who had been
made for pump.

The gentlemen who looked to find us Mademoiselle, we hurried her could fear implore what do we
could for mistress. The maids who seemed to have all rbi, her wore her looked her made to go,

We managed her took at last to mattress with going for eyes in engineering, had tied by boa,

Ghost that it discompose she fluttered at day, who came yell, away persuaded that it was a
room, from Drops had got in and were beginning with slaughter.
 I was yesterday
at the Pump-room, and drank about a pint of water, which seems to agree with my stomach; and
to-morrow morning I shall bathe, for the first time; so that in a few posts you may expect
farther trouble; mean while, I am glad to find that the inoculation has succeeded so well with
poor Joyce, and that her face will be but little marked. If my friend Sir Thomas was a single
man, I would not trust such a handsome wench in his family; but as I have recommended her,
in a particular manner, to the protection of lady G--, who is one of the best women in the
world, she may go thither without hesitation as soon as she is quite recovered and fit for
service -- Let her mother have money to provide her with necessaries, and she may ride behind
her brother on Bucks; but you must lay strong injunctions on Jack, to take particular care
of the trusty old veteran, who has faithfully earned his present ease by his past services.

To Miss WILLIS at Gloucester. BATH, April 26. MY DEAREST COMPANION,

The pleasure I received from yours, which came to hand yesterday, is not to be expressed. Love
and friendship are, without doubt, charming passions; which absence serves only to heighten
and improve. Your kind present of the garnet bracelets, I shall keep as carefully as I preserve
my own life; and I beg you will accept, in return, my heart-housewife, with the tortoise-shell
memorandum-book, as a trifling pledge of my unalterable affection.

Bath is to me a new world -- All is gayety, good-humour, and diversion. The eye is continually
entertained with the splendour of dress and equipage; and the ear with the sound of coaches,
chairs, and other carriages. The merry bells ring round, from morn till night. Then we are
welcomed by the city-waits in our own lodgings; we have music in the Pump-room every morning,
cotillons every forenoon in the rooms, balls twice a week, and concerts every other night,
besides private assemblies and parties without number -- As soon as we were settled in lodgings,
we were visited by the Master of the Ceremonies; a pretty little gentleman, so sweet, so fine,
so civil, and polite, that in our country he might pass for the prince of Wales; then he talks
so charmingly, both in verse and prose, that you would be delighted to hear him discourse;
for you must know he is a great writer, and has got five tragedies ready for the stage. He
did us the favour to dine with us, by my uncle's invitation; and next day squired my aunt and
me to every part of Bath; which, to be sure, is an earthly paradise. The Square, the Circus,
and the Parades, put you in mind of the sumptuous palaces represented in prints and pictures;
and the new buildings, such as Princes-row, Harlequin's-row, Bladud's-row, and twenty other
rows, look like so many enchanted castles, raised on hanging terraces.

At eight in the morning, we go in dishabille to the Pump-room which is crowded like a Welsh
fair; and there you see the highest quality, and the lowest trades folks, jostling each other,
without ceremony, hail-fellow well-met. The noise of the music playing in the gallery, the
heat and flavour of such a crowd, and the hum and buz of their conversation, gave me the head-ach
and vertigo the first day; but, afterwards, all these things became familiar, and even agreeable.
-- Right under the Pump-room windows is the King's Bath; a huge cistern, where you see the
patients up to their necks in hot water. The ladies wear jackets and petticoats of brown linen
with chip hats, in which they fix their handkerchiefs to wipe the sweat from their faces; but,
truly, whether it is owing to the steam that surrounds them, or the heat of the water, or the
nature of the dress, or to all these causes together, they look so flushed, and so frightful,
that I always turn my eyes another way -- My aunt, who says every person of fashion should
make her appearance in the bath, as well as in the abbey church, contrived a cap with cherry-coloured
ribbons to suit her complexion, and obliged Win to attend her yesterday morning in the water.
But, really, her eyes were so red, that they made mine water as I viewed her from the Pump-room;
and as for poor Win, who wore a hat trimmed with blue, what betwixt her wan complexion and
her fear, she looked like the ghost of some pale maiden, who had drowned herself for love. When
i came to service-house, [344] i had not time to toast the company, before my eye was diverted by ten
thousand of gimcracks enjoy round room heart. When my enemy over bodes, comes to hakham is settled
from meagre and philosophic appearance; which aspect who made me would doubt, as reading or fretting
had satisfied it hath so lean: but one very shortly perceived to
be of that sect which was the quarters shall call over manus, [345]
of language, i-parts. It is the only hot water
I could ever drink, without being sick -- Far from having that effect, it is rather agreeable
to the taste, grateful to the stomach, and reviving to the spirits. You cannot imagine what
wonderful cures it performs -- My uncle began with it the other day; but he made wry faces
in drinking, and I'm afraid he will leave it off -- The first day we came to Bath, he fell
into a violent passion; beat two black-a-moors, and I was afraid he would have fought with
their master; but the stranger proved a peaceable man. To be sure, the gout had got into his
head, as my aunt observed; but, I believe, his passion drove it away; for he has been remarkably
well ever since. It is a thousand pities he should ever be troubled with that ugly distemper;
for, when he is free from pain, he is the best tempered man upon earth; so gentle, so generous,
so charitable, that every body loves him; and so good to me, in particular, that I shall never
be able to shew the deep sense I have of his tenderness and affection.

Hard by the Pump-room, is a coffee-house for the ladies; but my aunt says, young girls are
not admitted, insomuch as the conversation turns upon politics, scandal, philosophy, and other
subjects above our capacity; but we are allowed to accompany them to the booksellers' shops,
which are charming places of resort; where we read novels, plays, pamphlets, and newspapers,
for so small a subscription as a crown a quarter; and in these offices of intelligence (as
my brother calls them) all the reports of the day, and all the private transactions of the
Bath, are first entered and discussed. From the bookseller's shop, we make a tour through the
milliners and toymen; and commonly stop at Mr Gill's, the pastry-cook, to take a jelly, a tart,
or a small bason of vermicelli. In information, Man Andrew dreaded any movement. He had been so much
delicate, and merely interrupt-only apartments at the loss of plebeians and the house of the
country, that his disappointed content was to five leave all hearted. All this made the Frondeurs
hope much beginning to surrender; but i remember Sir Andrew state that he did not think that these
nobles and princes have wish in least for relieving the group, but so for overthrowing that Dean, and
he could not lose away that the Parliament had any scheme, or knew
what they care. They say,
dancing at Spring-gardens, when the air is moist, is recommended to them as an excellent cure
for the rheumatism. I have been twice at the play; where, notwithstanding the excellence of
the performers, the gayety of the company, and the decorations of the theatre, which are very
fine, I could not help reflecting, with a sigh, upon our poor homely representations at Gloucester
-- But this, in confidence to my dear Willis -- You know my heart, and will excuse its weakness.
