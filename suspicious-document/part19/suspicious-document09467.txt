One of the earliest experiments to be introduced into psychology was that on reaction time,
conducted as follows: The experimenter tells his "subject" (the person whose reaction is to
be observed) to be ready to make a certain movement as promptly as possible on receiving a
certain stimulus. The response prescribed is usually a slight movement of the forefinger, and
the stimulus may be a sound, a flash of light, a touch on the skin, etc. The subject knows
in advance exactly what stimulus is to be given and what response he has to make, and is given
a "Ready!" signal a few seconds before the stimulus. With so simple a performance, the reaction
time is very short, and delicate apparatus must be employed to measure it. The "chronoscope"
or clock used to measure the reaction time reads to the hundredth or thousandth of a second,
and the time is found to be about .15 sec. in responding to sound or touch, about .18 sec.
in responding to light.

Even the simple reaction time varies, however, from one {23} individual to another, and from
one trial to another. Some persons can never bring their record much below the figures stated,
while a few can get the time down to .10 sec, which is about the limit of human ability. Every
one is bound to vary from trial to trial, at first widely, after practice between narrow limits,
but always by a few hundredths of a second at the least. It is curious to find the elementary
fact of variability of reaction present in such a simple performance.

What we have been describing is known as the "simple reaction", in distinction from other experiments
that demand more of the subject. In the "choice reaction", there are two stimuli and the subject
may be required to react to the one with the right hand and to the other with the left; for
example, if a red light appears he must respond with the right hand, but if a green light appears,
with the left. Here he cannot allow himself to become keyed up to as high a pitch as in the
simple reaction, for if he does he will make many false reactions. Therefore, the choice reaction
time is longer than the simple reaction time--about a tenth of a second longer.

The "associative reaction" time is longer still. Here the subject must name any color that
is shown, or read any letter that is shown, or respond to the sight of any number by calling
out the next larger number, or respond to any suitable word by naming its opposite. He cannot
be so well prepared as for the simple, or choice reaction, since he doesn't know exactly what
the stimulus is going to be; also, the brain process is more complex here; so that the reaction
time is longer, about a tenth of a second longer, at the best, than the choice reaction. It
may run up to two or three seconds, even in fairly simple cases, while if any serious thinking
or choosing has to be done, it runs into many seconds and even into minutes. Here the brain
process is very {24} complex and involves a series of steps before the required motor response
can be made.

These laboratory experiments can be paralleled by many everyday performances. The runner starting
at the pistol shot, after the preparatory "Ready! Set!", and the motorman applying the brakes
at the expected sound of the bell, are making "simple" reactions. The boxer, dodging to the
right or the left according to the blow aimed at him by his adversary, is making choice reactions,
and this type is very common in all kinds of steering, handling tools and managing machinery.
Reading words, adding numbers, and a large share of simple mental performances, are essentially
associative reactions. In most cases from ordinary life, the preparation is less complete than
in the laboratory experiments, and the reaction time is accordingly longer.

Reflex Action

The simple reaction has some points of resemblance with the "reflex", which, also, is a prompt
motor response to a sensory stimulus. A familiar example is the reflex wink of the eyes in
response to anything touching the eyeball, or in response to an object suddenly approaching
the eye. This "lid reflex" is quicker than the quickest simple reaction, taking about .05 second.
The knee jerk or "patellar reflex", aroused by a blow on the patellar tendon just below the
knee when the knee is bent and the lower leg hanging freely, is quicker still, taking about
.03 second. The reason for this extreme quickness of the reflex will appear as we proceed.
However, not every reflex is as quick as those mentioned, and some are slower than the quickest
of the simple reactions.

A few other examples of reflexes may be given. The "pupillary reflex" is the narrowing of the
pupil of the eye {25} in response to a bright light suddenly shining into the eye. The "flexion
reflex" is the pulling up of the leg in response to a pinch, prick or burn on the foot. Coughing
and sneezing are like this in being protective reflexes, and the scratching of the dog belongs
here also.

There are many internal reflexes: movements of the stomach and intestines, swallowing and hiccoughing,
widening and narrowing of the arteries resulting in flushing and paling of the skin. These
are muscular responses; and there are also glandular reflexes, such as the discharge of saliva
from the salivary glands into the mouth, in response to a tasting substance, the flow of the
gastric juice when food reaches the stomach, the flow of tears when a cinder gets into the
eye. There are also inhibitory reflexes, such as the momentary stoppage of breathing in response
to a dash of cold water. All in all, a large number of reflexes are to be found.

Most reflexes can be seen to be useful to the organism. A large proportion of them are protective
in one way or another, while others might be called regulative, in that they adjust the organism
to the conditions affecting it.

Now comparing the reflex with the simple reaction, we see first that the reflex is more deep-seated
in the organism, and more essential to its welfare. The reflex is typically quicker than the
simple reaction. The reflex machinery does not need a "Ready" signal, nor any preparation,
but is always ready for business. (The subject in a simple reaction experiment would not make
the particular finger movement that he makes unless he had made ready for that movement.) The
attachment of a certain response to a certain stimulus, rather arbitrary and temporary in the
simple reaction, is inherent and permanent in the reflex. Reflex action is involuntary and
often entirely unconscious.

Reflexes, we said, are permanent. That is because they {26} are native or inherent in the organism.
You can observe them in the new-born child. The reflex connection between stimulus and response
is something the child brings with him into the world, as distinguished from what he has to
acquire through training and experience. He does acquire, as he grows up, a tremendous number
of habitual responds that become automatic and almost unconscious, and these "secondary automatic"
reactions resemble reflexes pretty closely. Grasping for your hat when you feel the wind taking
it from your head is an example. These acquired reactions never reach the extreme speed of
the quickest reflexes, but at best may have about the speed of the simple reaction. Though
often useful enough, they are not so fundamentally necessary as the reflexes. "The lives of saints"are
not confined to history, even they embrace what ever is most valuble
in history,as they are sacred,ecclesiastical,or profone.This work

 That is the way it is in the nervous system, with "nerve center" substituted
for "central", and "sense organ" and "muscle or gland" for "telephones A and B."

The advantage of the centralized system is that it is a system, affording connections between
any part and any other, and unifying the whole complex organism.

The nerve centers are located in the brain and spinal cord. The brain lies in the skull and
the cord extends from the brain down through a tube in the middle of the {30} backbone. Of
the brain many parts can be named, but for the present it is enough to divide it into the "brain
stem", a continuation of the spinal cord up along the base of the skull cavity, and the two
great outgrowths of the brain stem, called "cerebrum" and "cerebellum". The spinal cord and
brain stem contain the lower or reflex centers, while the cerebellum, and especially the cerebrum,
contain the "higher centers". The lower centers are directly connected by nerves with the sense
organs, glands and muscles, while the higher centers have direct connections with the lower
and only through them with the sense organs, glands and muscles. In other words, the sensory
nerves run into the cord or brain stem, and the motor nerves run out of these same, while interconnecting
nerve strands extend between the lower centers in the cord and brain stem and the higher centers
in the cerebrum and cerebellum.

The spinal cord contains the reflex centers for the limbs and part of the trunk, and is connected
by sensory and motor nerves with the limbs and trunk. The brain stem contains the reflex centers
for the head and also for part of the interior of the trunk, including the heart and lungs,
and is connected with them by sensory and motor nerves. The nerve center that takes part in
the flexion reflex of the foot is situated in the lower part of the cord, that for the similar
reflex of the hand lies in the upper part of the cord, that for breathing lies in the lower
or rear part of the brain stem, and that for winking lies further forward in the brain stem.

Big movements, such as the combined action of all four legs of an animal in walking, require
cord and brain stem to work together, and throw into relief what is really true even of simpler
reflexes, namely that a reflex is a coordinated movement, in the sense that different muscles
cooperate in its execution.

{31}

Internal Construction of the Nerves and Nerve Centers

We shall understand nerve action better if we know something of the way in which the nervous
system is built. A nerve is not to be thought of as a unit, nor are the brain and cord to be
thought of as mere masses of some peculiar substance.

A nerve is a bundle of many slender insulated threads, just as a telephone cable, running along
the street, {32} is a bundle of many separate wires which are the real units of telephonic
communication. A nerve center, like the switchboard in a telephone central, consists of many
parts and connections.

The whole nervous system is essentially composed of neurones. A neurone is a nerve cell with
its branches. Most nerve cells have two kinds of branches, called the axon and the dendrites.

The nerve cell is a microscopic speck of living matter. Its dendrites are short tree-like branches,
while its axon is often several inches or even feet in length. The axon is the "slender thread",
just spoken of as analogous to the single telephone wire. A nerve is composed of axons. [Footnote:
The axon is always protected or insulated by a sheath, and axon and sheath, taken together,
are often called a "nerve fiber".] The "white matter" of the brain and cord is composed of
axons. Axons afford the means of communication between the nerve centers and the muscles and
sense organs, and between one nerve center and another.

The axons which make up the motor nerves are branches of nerve cells situated in the cord and
brain stem; they extend from the reflex center for any muscle out to and into that muscle and
make very close connection with the muscle substance. A nerve current, starting from the nerve
cells in the reflex center, runs rapidly along the axons to the muscle and arouses it to activity.

The axons which make up the optic nerve, or nerve of sight, are branches of nerve cells in
the eye, and extend into the brain stem. Light striking the eye starts nerve currents, which
run along these axons into the brain stem. Similarly, the axons of the nerve of smell are branches
of cells in the nose.

The remainder of the sensory axons are branches of nerve cells that lie in little bunches close
alongside the cord or {33} brain stem. These cells have no dendrites, but their axon, dividing,
reaches in one direction out to a sense organ and in the other direction into the cord or brain
stem, and thus connects the sense organ with its "lower center".

Where an axon terminates, it broadens out into a thin plate, or breaks up into a tuft of very
fine branches ( the "end-brush"), and by this means makes close contact with the muscle, the
sense organ, or the neurone with which it connects.

{34}

The Synapse

Now let us consider the mode of connection between one neurone and another in a nerve center.
The axon of one neurone, through its end-brush, is in close contact with the dendrites of another
neurone. There is contact, but no actual growing-together; the two neurones remain distinct,
and this contact or junction of two neurones is called a "synapse". The synapse, then, is not
a thing, but simply a junction between two neurones.

The junction is good enough so that one of the two neurones, if itself active, can arouse the
other to activity. The end-brush, when a nerve current reaches it from its own nerve cell,
arouses the dendrites of the other neurone, and thus starts a nerve current running along those
dendrites to their nerve cell and thence out along its axon.

Now here is a curious and significant fact: the dendrites are receiving organs, not transmitting;
they pick up messages from the end-brushes across the synapse, but send out no messages to
those end-brushes. Communication across a synapse is always in one direction, from end-brush
to dendrites.

This, then, is the way in which a reflex is carried out, the pupillary reflex, for example.
Light entering the eye starts a nerve current in the axons of the optic nerve; these axons
terminate in the brain stem, where their end-brushes arouse the dendrites of motor nerve cells,
and the axons of these {35} cells, extending out to the muscle of the pupil, cause it to contract,
and narrow the pupil.

Or again, this is the way in which one nerve center arouses another to activity. The axons
of the cells in the first center (or some of them) extend out of this center and through the
white matter to the second center, where they terminate, their end-brushes forming synapses
with the cells of the second center. Let the first center be thrown into activity, and immediately,
through this connection, it arouses the second.

The "gray matter" comprises the nerve centers, lower and higher. It is made up of nerve cells
and their dendrites, of the beginnings of axons issuing from these cells and of the terminations
of incoming axons. The white matter, as was said before, consists of axons. An axon issues
from the {36} gray matter at one point, traverses the white matter for a longer or shorter
distance, and finally turns into the gray matter at another point, and thus nerve connection
is maintained between these two points.

There are lots of nerve cells, billions of them. That ought to be plenty, and yet--well, perhaps
sometimes they are not well developed, or their synapses are not close enough to make good
connections.

Examined under the microscope, the nerve cell is seen to contain, besides the "nucleus" which
is present in every living cell and is essential for maintaining its vitality and special characteristics,
certain peculiar granules which appear to be stores of fuel to be consumed in the activity
of the cell, and numerous very fine fibrils coursing through the cell and out into the axon
and dendrites.

The reflex arc can now be described more precisely than before. Beginning in a sense organ,
it extends along a sensory axon (really along a team of axons acting side by side) to its end-brush
in a lower center, where it crosses a synapse and enters the dendrites of a motor neurone and
so {37} reaches the cell body and axon of this neurone, which last extends out to the muscle
(or gland). The simplest reflex arc consists then of a sensory neurone and a motor neurone,
meeting at a synapse in a lower or reflex center. This would be a two-neurone arc.

Very often, and possibly always, the reflex arc really consists of three neurones, a "central"
neurone intervening between the sensory and motor neurones and being connected through synapses
with each. The central neurone plays an important rôle in coördination.

COÖRDINATION

The internal structure of nerve centers helps us see how coördinated movement is produced.
The question is, how {38} several muscles are made to work together harmoniously, and also
how it is possible that a pin prick, directly affecting just a few sensory axons, causes a
big movement of many muscles. Well, we find the sensory axon, as it enters the cord, sending
off a number of side branches, each of which terminates in an end-brush in synaptic connection
with the dendrites of a motor nerve cell.

Thus the nerve current from a single sensory neurone is distributed to quite a number of motor
neurones. Where there are central neurones in the arc, their branching axons aid in distributing
the excitation; and so we get a big movement in response to a minute, though intense stimulus.

But the response is not simply big; it is definite, coordinated, representing team work on
the part of the muscles as distinguished from indiscriminate mass action. That means selective
distribution of the nerve current. The axons of the sensory and central neurones do not connect
with any and every motor neurone indiscriminately, but link up with selected groups of motor
neurones, and thus harness together teams that will work in definite ways, producing {39} flexion
of a limb in the case of one such team, and extension in the case of another. Every reflex
has its own team of motor neurones, harnessed together by its outfit of sensory and central
neurones. The same motor neurone may however be harnessed into two or more such teams, as is
seen from the fact that the same muscle may participate in different reflex movements; and
for a similar reason we believe that the same sensory neurone may be utilized in more than
one reflex arc.

The most distinctive part of any reflex arc is likely to be its central neurones, which are
believed to play the chief part in coördination, and in determining the peculiarities of any
given reflex, such as its speed and rhythm of action.

Reactions in General

Though the reflex is simple by comparison with voluntary movements, it is not the simplest
animal reaction, for it is coördinated and depends on the nervous system, while the simplest
animals, one-celled animals, have no nervous system, any more than they have muscles or organs
of any {40} kind. Without possessing separate organs for the different vital functions, these
little creatures do nevertheless take in and digest food, reproduce their kind, and move. Every
animal shows at least two different motor reactions, a positive or approaching reaction, and
a negative or avoiding reaction.

The general notion of a reaction is that of a response to a stimulus. The stimulus acts on
the organism and the organism acts back. If I am struck by a wave and rolled over on the beach,
that is passive motion and not my reaction; but if the wave stimulates me to maintain my footing,
then I am active, I respond or react.

Now there is no such thing as wholly passive motion. Did not Newton teach that "action and
reaction are equal"?--and he was thinking of stones and other inanimate objects. The motion
of a stone or ball depends on its own weight and shape and elasticity as much as on the blow
it receives. Even the stone counts for something in determining its own behavior.

A loaded gun counts for more than a stone, because of the stored energy of the powder that
is set free by the blow of the hammer. The "reaction" of the gun is greater than the force
acting on it, because of this stored energy that is discharged.

An animal reaction resembles the discharge of the gun, since there is stored energy in the
animal, consisting in the chemical attraction between food absorbed and oxygen inspired, and
some of this energy is utilized and converted into motion when the animal reacts. The stimulus,
like the trigger of the gun, simply releases this stored energy.

The organism, animal or human, fully obeys the law of conservation of energy, all the energy
it puts out being accounted for by stored energy it has taken in in food and oxygen. But at
any one time, when the organism receives {41} a stimulus, the energy that it puts forth in
reaction comes from inside itself.

There is another way in which the organism counts in determining its reaction. Not only does
it supply the energy of the response, but its own internal arrangements determine how that
energy shall be directed. That is to say, the organism does not blow up indiscriminately, like
a charge of dynamite, but makes some definite movement. This is true even of the simplest animals,
and the more elaborate the internal mechanism of the animal, the more the animal itself has
to do with the kind of response it shall make to a stimulus. The nervous system of the higher
animals, by the connections it provides between the stimulus and the stores of energy in the
muscles, is of especial importance in determining the nature of the response.

Stimuli are necessary to arouse the activity of the organism. Without any stimulus whatever,
it seems likely that the animal would relapse into total inactivity. It should be said, however,
that stimuli, such as that of hunger, may arise within the organism itself. The stimulus may
be external or internal, but some stimulus is necessary in order to release the stored energy.

In general, then, a reaction consists in the release by a stimulus of some of the stored energy
of an animal, and the direction of that energy by the animal's own internal mechanism of nerves
and muscles (and, we may add, bones and sinews) into the form of some definite response.

CHAPTER III

REACTIONS OF DIFFERENT LEVELS

HOW SENSATIONS, PERCEPTIONS AND THOUGHTS MAY BE CONSIDERED AS FORMS OF INNER RESPONSE, AND
HOW THESE HIGHER REACTIONS ARE RELATED IN THE NERVOUS SYSTEM TO THE SIMPLER RESPONSES OF THE
REFLEX LEVEL.

Having defined a reaction as an act of the individual aroused by a stimulus, there is no reason
why we should not include a great variety of mental processes under the general head of reactions.
Any mental process is an activity of the organism, and it is aroused by some stimulus, external
or internal; therefore, it is a reaction.

I hear a noise--now, while the noise, as a physical stimulus, comes to me, my hearing it is
my own act, my sensory reaction to the stimulus. I recognize the noise as the whistle of a
steamboat--this recognition is clearly my own doing, dependent on my own past experience, and
may be called a perception or perceptive response. The boat's whistle reminds me of a vacation
spent on an island--clearly a memory response. The memory arouses an agreeable feeling--an
affective response, this may be called. In its turn, this may lead me to imagine how pleasant
it would be to spend another vacation on that island, and to cast about for ways and means
to accomplish this result--here we have imagination and reasoning, aroused by what preceded
just as the sensation was aroused by the physical stimulus.

In speaking of any mental process as an act of the individual, we do not mean to imply that
he is always conscious {46} of his activity. Sometimes he feels active, sometimes passive.
He feels active in hard muscular work or hard thinking, while he feels passive in reflex action,
in sensation, and in simply "being reminded" of anything without any effort on his own part.
But he is active in everything he does, and he does everything that depends on his being alive.
Life is activity, and every manifestation of life, such as reflex action or sensation, is a
form of vital activity. The only way to be inactive is to be dead.

But vital activity is not "self-activity" in any absolute sense, for it is aroused by some
stimulus. It does not issue from the individual as an isolated unit, but is his response to
a stimulus. That is the sense of calling any mental process a reaction; it is something the
individual does in response to a stimulus.

To call a sensation a form of reaction means, then, that the sensation is not something done
to the person, nor passively received by him from outside, but something that he himself does
when aroused to this particular form of activity. What comes from outside and is received by
the individual is the stimulus, and the sensation is what he does in response to the stimulus.
It represents the discharge of internal stored energy in a direction determined by his own
inner mechanism. The sensation depends on his own make-up as well as on the nature of the stimulus,
as is especially obvious when the sensation is abnormal or peculiar. Take the case of color
blindness. The same stimulus that arouses in most people the sensation of red arouses in the
color-blind individual the sensation of brown. Now what the color-blind individual receives,
the light stimulus, is the same as what others receive, but he responds differently, i.e.,
with a different sensation, because his own sensory apparatus is peculiar.

The main point of this discussion is that all mental {47} phenomena, whether movements, sensations,
emotions, impulses or thoughts, are a person's acts, but that every act is a response to some
present stimulus. This rather obvious truth has not always seemed obvious. Some theorists,
in emphasizing the spontaneity and "self-activity" of the individual, have pushed the stimulus
away into the background; while others, fixing their attention on the stimulus, have treated
the individual as the passive recipient of sensation and "experience" generally. Experience,
however, is not received; it is lived, and that means done; only, it is done in response to
stimuli. The concept of reaction covers the ground.

While speaking of sensations and thoughts as belonging under the general head of reactions,
it is well, however, to bear in mind that all mental action tends to arouse and terminate in
muscular and glandular activity. A thought or a feeling tends to "express itself" in words
or (other) deeds. The motor response may be delayed, or inhibited altogether, but the tendency
is always in that direction.

Different Sorts of Stimuli

To call all mental processes reactions means that it is always in order to ask for the stimulus.
Typically, the stimulus is an external force or motion, such as light or sound, striking on
a sense organ. There are also the internal stimuli, consisting of changes occurring within
the body and acting on the sensory nerves that are distributed to the muscles, bones, lungs,
stomach and most of the organs. The sensations of muscular strain and fatigue, and of hunger
and thirst, are aroused by internal stimuli, and many reflexes are aroused in the same way.

Such internal stimuli as these are like the better known external stimuli in that they act
upon sense organs; but it {48} seems necessary to recognize another sort of stimuli which act
directly on the nerve centers in the brain. These may be called "central stimuli" and so contrasted
with the "peripheral stimuli" that act on any sense organ, external or internal. To do this
is to take considerable liberty with the plain meaning of  "stimulus", and calls for justification.
What is the excuse for thus expanding the notion of a stimulus?

The excuse is found in the frequent occurrence of mental processes that are not directly aroused
by any peripheral stimulus, though they are plainly aroused by something else. Anything that
arouses a thought or feeling can properly be called its stimulus. Now it often happens that
a thought is aroused by another, just preceding thought; and it seems quite in order to call
the first thought the stimulus and the second the response. A thought may arouse an emotion,
as when the thought of my enemy, suddenly occurring to mind, makes me angry; the thought is
then the stimulus arousing this emotional response.

If hearing you speak of Calcutta makes me think of India, your words are the stimulus and my
thought the response. Well, then, if I think of Calcutta in the course of a train of thought,
and next think of India, what else can we say than that the thought of Calcutta acts as a stimulus
to arouse the thought of India as the response? In a long train of thought, where A reminds
you of B and B of C and C of D, each of these items is, first, a response to the preceding,
and, second, a stimulus to the one following.

There is no special difficulty with the notion of "central stimuli" from the physiological
side. We have simply to think of one nerve center arousing another by means of the tract of
axons connecting the two. Say the auditory center is aroused by hearing some one mention your
friend's name, {49} and this promptly calls up a mental picture of your friend; here the auditory
center has aroused the visual. What happens in a train of thought is that first one group of
neurones is aroused to activity, and then this activity, spreading along the axons that extend
from this group of neurones to another, arouses the second group to activity; and so on. The
brain process may often be exceedingly complex, but this simple scheme gives the gist of it.

The way nerve currents must go shooting around the brain from one center or group of neurones
to another, keeping it up for a long time without requiring any fresh peripheral stimulus,
is remarkable. We have evidence of this sort of thing in a dream or fit of abstraction. Likely
enough, the series of brain responses would peter out after awhile, in the absence of any fresh
peripheral stimulus, and total inactivity ensue. But response of one brain center to nerve
currents coming from another brain center, and not directly from any sense organ, must be the
rule rather than the exception, since most of the brain neurones are not directly connected
with any sense organ, but only with other parts of the brain itself. All the evidence we have
would indicate that the brain is not "self-active", but only responsive; but, once thrown into
activity at one point, it may successively become active at many other points, so that a long
series of mental operations may follow upon a single sensory stimulus.

The Motor Centers, Lower and Higher

A "center" is a collection of nerve cells, located somewhere in the brain or cord, which gives
off axons running to some other center or out to muscles or glands, while it also receives
axons coming from other centers, or from sense organs. These incoming axons terminate in end-brushes
and so form synapses with the dendrites of the local {50} nerve cells. The axons entering any
center and terminating there arouse that center to activity, and this activity, when aroused,
is transmitted out along the axons issuing from that center, and produces results where those
axons terminate in their turn.

The lower motor centers, called also reflex centers, are located in the cord or brain stem,
and their nerve cells give rise to the axons that form the motor nerves and connect with the
muscles and glands. A muscle is thrown into action by nerve currents from its lower motor center.

The principal higher motor center is the "motor area" of the brain, located in the cortex or
external layer of gray matter, in the cerebrum. More precisely, the motor area is a long, narrow
strip of cortex, lying just forward of what is called the "central fissure" or "fissure of
Rolando".

{51}

If you run your finger over the top of the head from one side to the other, about halfway back
from the forehead, the motor areas of the two cerebral hemispheres will lie close under the
path traced by your finger.

The motor area in the right hemisphere is connected with the left half of the cord and so with
the muscles of the left half of the body; the motor area of the left hemisphere similarly affects
{52} the right half of the body. Within the motor area are centers for the several limbs and
other motor organs. Thus, at the top, near the middle line of the head (and just about where
the phrenologists located their "bump of veneration"!), is the center for the legs; next below
and to the side is the center for the trunk, next that for the arm, next that for head movements,
and at the bottom, not far from the ears, is the center for tongue and mouth.

The largest nerve cells of all are found in the motor area, and are called, from their shape,
the "giant pyramids". They have large dendrites and very long axons, which latter, {53} running
in a thick bundle down from the cortex through the brain stem and cord, constitute the "pyramidal
tract", the principal path of communication from the cerebrum to the lower centers. The motor
area of the brain has no direct connection with any muscle, but acts through the pyramidal
tract on the lower centers, which in turn act on the muscles.

How The Brain Produces Muscular Movements

The motor area is itself aroused to action by nerve currents entering it through axons coming
from other parts of the cortex; and it is by way of the motor area that any other part of the
cortex produces bodily movement. There are a few exceptions, as, for example, the movements
of the eyes are produced generally by the "visual area" acting directly on the lower motor
centers for the eye in the brain stem; but, in the main, any motor effect of brain action is
exerted through the motor area. The motor area, as already mentioned, acts on the lower motor
centers in the cord and brain stem, and these in turn on the muscles; but we must look into
this matter a little more closely.

A lower motor center is a group of motor and central neurones, lying anywhere in the cord or
brain stem, and capable of directly arousing a certain coördinated muscular movement. One such
unit gives flexion of the leg, another gives extension of the leg, a third gives the rapid
alternation of flexion and extension that we see in the scratching movement of the dog. Such
a motor center can be aroused to activity by a sensory stimulus, and the resulting movement
is then called a reflex.

The lower center can be aroused in quite another way, and that is by nerve currents coming
from the brain, by way of the motor area and the pyramidal tract. Thus flexion of the leg can
occur voluntarily as well as reflexly. The same {54} muscles, and the same motor neurones,
do the job in either case. In the reflex, the lower center is aroused by a sensory nerve, and
in the voluntary movement by the pyramidal tract.

The story is told of a stranger who was once dangling his legs over the edge of the station
platform at a small backwoods town, when a native called out to him "Hist!" (hoist), pointing
to the ground under the stranger's feet. He "histed" obediently, which is to say that he voluntarily
threw into play the spinal center for leg flexion; and then, looking down, saw a rattler coiled
just beneath where his feet had been hanging. Now even if he had spied the rattler first, the
resulting flexion, though impulsive and involuntary, would still have been aroused by way of
the motor area and the pyramidal tract, since the movement would have been a response to knowledge
of what that object was and signified, and knowledge means action by the cerebral cortex, which
we have seen to affect movement through the medium of the motor area. But if the snake had
made the first move, the same leg movement on the man's part, made now in response to the painful
sensory stimulus, would have been the flexion reflex.

Facilitation and Inhibition

Not only can the motor area call out essentially the same movements that are also produced
reflexly, but it can prevent or inhibit the execution of a reflex in spite of the sensory stimulus
for the reflex being present, and it can reinforce or facilitate the action of the sensory
stimulus so as to assist in the production of the reflex. We see excellent examples of cerebral
facilitation and inhibition in the case of the knee jerk. This sharp forward kick of the foot
and lower leg is aroused by a tap on the tendon running in front {55} of the knee. Cross the
knee to be stimulated over the other leg, and tap the tendon just below the knee cap, and the
knee jerk appears. So purely reflex is this movement that it cannot be duplicated voluntarily;
for, though the foot can of course be voluntarily kicked forward, this voluntary movement does
not have the suddenness and quickness of the true reflex. For all that, the cerebrum can exert
an influence on the knee jerk. Anxious attention to the knee jerk inhibits it; gritting the
teeth or clenching the fist reinforces it. These are cerebral influences acting by way of the
pyramidal tract upon the spinal center for the reflex.

Thus the cortex controls the reflexes. Other examples of such control are seen when you prevent
for a time the natural regular winking of the eyes by voluntarily holding them wide open, or
when, carrying a hot dish which you know you must not drop, you check the flexion reflex which
would naturally pull the hand away from the painful stimulus. The young child learns to control
the reflexes of evacuation, and gradually comes to have control over the breathing movements,
so as to hold his breath or breathe rapidly or deeply at will, and to expire vigorously in
order to blow out a match.

The coughing, sneezing and swallowing reflexes likewise come under voluntary control. In all
such cases, the motor area facilitates or inhibits the action of the lower centers.

Super-motor Centers in the Cortex

Another important effect of the motor area upon the lower centers consists in combining their
action so as to produce what we know as skilled movements. It will be remembered that the lower
centers themselves give coördinated movements, such as flexion or extension of the whole limb;
but still higher coördinations result from cerebral control. {56} When the two hands, though
executing different movements, work together to produce a definite result, we have coördination
controlled by the cortex. Examples of this are seen in handling an ax or bat, or in playing
the piano or violin. A movement of a single hand, as in writing or buttoning a coat, may also
represent a higher or cortical coördination.

Now it appears that the essential work in producing these higher coördinations of skilled movement
is performed not by the motor area, but by neighboring parts of the cortex, which act on the
motor area in much the same way as the motor area acts on the lower centers. Some of these
{57} skilled-movement centers, or super-motor centers, are located in the cortex just forward
of the motor area, in the adjacent parts of the frontal lobe. Destruction of the cortex there,
through injury or disease, deprives the individual of some of his skilled movements, though
not really paralyzing him. He can still make simple movements, but not the complex movements
of writing or handling an instrument.

It is a curious fact that the left hemisphere, which exerts control over the movements of the
right hand and right side of the body generally, also plays the leading part in skilled movements
of either hand. This is true, at least, of right-handed persons; probably in the left-handed
the right hemisphere dominates.

Motor power may be lost through injury at various points in the nervous system. Injury to the
spinal cord, destroying the lower motor center for the legs, brings complete paralysis. Injury
to the motor area or to the pyramidal tract does not destroy reflex movement, but cuts off
all voluntary movement and cerebral control. Injury to the "super-motor centers" causes loss
of skilled movement, and produces the condition of  "apraxia", in which the subject, though
knowing what he wants to do, and though still able to move his limbs, simply cannot get the
combination for the skilled act that he has in mind.

Speech Centers

Similar to apraxia is "aphasia" or loss of ability to speak. It bears the same relation to
true paralysis of the speech organs that hand apraxia bears to paralysis of the hand. Through
brain injury it sometimes happens that a person loses his ability to speak words, though he
can still make vocal sounds. The cases differ in severity, some retaining the ability to speak
only one or two words which {58} from frequent use have become almost reflex (swear words,
sometimes, or "yes" and "no"), while others are able to pronounce single words, but can no
longer put them together fluently into the customary form of phrases and sentences, and still
others can utter simple sentences, but not any connected speech.

In pure cases of motor aphasia, the subject knows the words he wishes to say, but cannot get
them out. The brain injury here lies in the frontal lobe in the left hemisphere, in right-handed
people, just forward of the motor area for the mouth, tongue and larynx. This "motor speech
center" is the best-known instance of a super-motor center. It coördinates the elementary speech
movements into the combinations called words; and perhaps there is no other motor performance
so highly skilled as this of speaking. It is acquired so early in life, and practised so constantly,
that {59} we take it quite as a matter of course, and think of a word as a simple and single
movement, while in fact even a short word, as spoken, is a complex movement requiring great
motor skill.

There is some evidence that the motor speech center extends well forward into the frontal lobe,
and that the front part of it is related to the part further back as this is to the motor area
back of it. That is to say, the back of the speech center combines the motor units of the motor
area into the skilled movements of speaking a word, while the more forward part of the speech
center combines the word movements into the still more complex movement of speaking a sentence.
It is even possible that the very front part of the speech center has to do with those still
higher combinations of speech movements that give fluency and real excellence of speaking.

The Auditory Centers

Besides the motor aphasia, just mentioned, there is another type, called sensory aphasia, or,
more precisely, auditory aphasia. In pure auditory aphasia there is no inability to pronounce
words or even to speak fluently, but there is, first, an inability to "hear words", sometimes
called word deafness, and there is often also an inability to find the right words to speak,
so that the individual so afflicted, while speaking fluently enough and having sense in mind,
misuses his words and utters a perfect jargon. One old gentleman mystified his friends one
morning by declaring that he must go and "have his umbrella washed", till it was finally discovered
that what he wanted was to have his hair cut.

The cortical area affected in this form of aphasia is located a little further back on the
surface of the brain than {60} the motor speech center, being close to the auditory area proper.
The latter is a small cortical region in the temporal lobe, connected (through lower centers)
with the ear, and is the only part of the cortex to receive nerve currents from the organ of
hearing. The auditory area is, indeed, the organ of hearing, or an organ of hearing, for without
it the individual is deaf. He may make a few reflex responses to loud noises, but, consciously,
he does not hear at all; he has no auditory sensations.

In the immediate neighborhood of the auditory area proper (or of the "auditory-sensory area",
as it may well be called), are portions of the cortex intimately connected by axons with it,
and concerned in what may be called auditory perceptions, i.e., with recognizing and understanding
sounds. Probably different portions of the cortex near the auditory-sensory center have to
do with different sorts of auditory perception. At least, we sometimes find individuals who,
as a result of injury or disease affecting this general region, are unable any longer to follow
and appreciate music. They cannot "catch the tune" any longer, though they may have been fine
musicians before this portion of their cortex was destroyed. In other cases, we find, instead
of this music deafness, the word deafness mentioned just above.

The jargon talk that so often accompanies word deafness reminds us of the fact that speech
is first of all auditory to the child. He understands what is said to him before he talks himself,
and his vocabulary for purposes of understanding always remains ahead of his speaking vocabulary.
It appears that this precedence of auditory speech over motor remains the fact throughout life,
in most persons, and that the auditory speech center is the most fundamental of all the speech
centers, of which there is one more not yet mentioned, used in reading.

{61}

{62}

The Visual Centers

There is a visual-sensory area in the occipital lobe, at the back of the brain, that is connected
with the eye in the same way as the auditory center is connected with the ear. Without it,
the individual still shows the pupillary reflex to light, but has no sensations of sight. He
is blind.

This visual-sensory area occupies only a small portion of the occipital lobe, and yet practically
the whole lobe is concerned with vision. Some portions of the lobe are concerned in perceiving
words in reading, and without them the individual is "word blind". Other portions are concerned
in perceiving (recognizing, understanding) seen objects, and without them the individual is
"object blind". Other {63} portions are concerned in perceiving color relations, and still
other portions in perceiving spatial relations through the sense of sight and so knowing where
seen objects are and being able to guide one's movements by sight.

Cortical Centers for the Other Senses

There is an olfactory area in a rather secluded part of the cortex, and this is related to
the sense of smell in the same general way. Probably there is a similar taste center, but it
has not been definitely located. Then there is a large and important area called the "somesthetic",
connected with the body senses generally, i.e., chiefly with the skin and muscle senses. This
area is located in a narrow strip just back of the central fissure, extending parallel to the
motor area which lies just in front of the fissure, and corresponding part for part with it,
so that the sensory area for the legs lies just behind the motor area for the legs, and so
on. Destruction of any part of this somesthetic area brings loss of the sensations from the
corresponding part of the body.

Just behind this direct sensory center for the body, in the parietal lobe, are portions of
the cortex concerned in perceiving facts by aid of the body senses. Perception of size and
shape by the sense of touch, perception of weight by the muscle sense, perception of degrees
of warmth and cold by the temperature sense, are dependent on the parietal lobe and disappear
when the cortex of this region is destroyed. It appears that there is a sort of hierarchy of
centers here, as in the motor region and probably also in the visual and auditory regions.
Skill in handling objects is partly dependent on the "feel" of the objects and so is impaired
by injuries to the parietal lobe, as well as by injury to the frontal lobe; and knowing how
to manage a fairly complex situation, as in lighting a fire when you have the various {64}
materials assembled before you, seems also to depend largely on this part of the cortex.

Lower Sensory Centers

As already indicated, no portion of the cortex, not even the sensory areas, is directly connected
with any sense organ. The sensory axons from the skin, for example, terminate in the spinal
cord, in what may be called the lowest sensory centers. Here are nerve cells whose axons pass
up through the cord and brain stem to the thalamus or interbrain, where they terminate in a
second sensory center. And cells here send their axons up to the somesthetic area of the cortex.

{65}

The thalamus is remarkable as an intermediate center for all the senses, except smell; but
exactly what is accomplished by this big intermediate sensory center remains rather a mystery,
though it certainly appears that the thalamus has something to do with feeling and emotion.

The Cerebellum

Regarding the cerebellum, there is much knowledge at hand, but it is difficult to give the
gist of it in a few words. On the one hand, the cerebellum receives a vast number of axons
from the lower sensory centers; while, on the other hand, it certainly has nothing to do with
conscious sensation or perception. Its use seems to be motor. It has much to do with maintaining
the equilibrium of the body, and probably also with maintaining the steadiness and general
efficiency of muscular contraction. Though it has no known sensory or intellectual functions,
it is very closely connected with the cerebrum, receiving a tremendous bundle of axons from
different parts of the cerebrum, by way of the brain stem. Possibly these are related to motor
activity. The phrenologists taught that the cerebellum was the center for the sexual instinct,
but there is no evidence in favor of this guess.

Different Levels of Reaction

Let a noise strike the ear and start nerve currents in along the auditory nerve, passing through
the lowest and intermediate centers and reaching the auditory-sensory area of the cortex. When
this last is aroused to activity, we have a sensation of sound, which is the first conscious
reaction to the external stimulus. Axons running from the auditory-sensory to the near-by cortex
give a perception of some fact indicated by the external stimulus, and this perception is a
{66} second and higher conscious reaction, which, to be sure, ordinarily occurs so quickly
after the first that introspection cannot distinguish one as first and the other as second;
but the facts of brain injury, already mentioned, enable us to draw the distinction. The perceived
fact may call up a mental image, or a recognition of some further fact less directly signified
by the noise; these would be reactions of still higher order. Much of the cortex is apparently
not very directly connected with either the sensory or the motor areas, and probably is concerned
somehow in the recognition of facts that are only very indirectly indicated by any single sensory
stimulus, or with the planning of actions that only indirectly issue in muscular movement.

On the sensory and intellectual side, the higher reactions follow the lower: sensation arouses
perception and perception thought. On the motor side, the lower reactions are aroused by the
higher. Thus the speech center arouses the motor centers for the speech organs, combining the
action of these into the speaking of a word; and in a similar way, it seems, the intention
to speak a sentence expressing a certain meaning acts as a stimulus to call up in order the
separate words that make the sentence. A general plan of action precedes and arouses the particular
acts and muscular movements that execute the plan.

CHAPTER IV

TENDENCIES TO REACTION

HOW MOTIVES INFLUENCE BEHAVIOR, AND HOW THEY FIT INTO A PSYCHOLOGY WHICH SEEKS TO ANALYZE BEHAVIOR
INTO REACTIONS.

One advantage of basing our psychology on reactions is that it keeps us "close to the ground",
and prevents our discussions from sailing off into the clouds of picturesque but fanciful interpretation.
Psychology is very apt to degenerate into a game of blowing bubbles, unless we pin ourselves
down to hard-headed ways of thinking. The notion of a reaction is of great value here, just
because it is so hard-headed and concrete. Whenever we have any human action before us for
explanation, we have to ask what the stimulus is that arouses the individual to activity, and
how he responds. Stimulus-response psychology is solid, and practical as well; for if it can
establish the laws of reaction, so as to predict what response will be made to a given stimulus,
and what stimulus can be depended on to arouse a desired response, it furnishes the "knowledge
that is power". Perhaps no more suitable motto could be inscribed over the door of a psychological
laboratory than these two words, "Stimulus-Response."

Such a motto would not frighten away the modern introspectionists, for they, no less than the
behaviorists, could find a congenial home in a stimulus-response laboratory. They would begin
by studying sensations, and, advancing to more complex responses, would observe the conscious
processes entering into the response.

{69}

But, however useful the reaction may be as affording a sound basis for psychological study,
we must not allow it to blind our eyes to any of the real facts of mental life; and, at first
thought, it seems as if motives, interests and purposes did not fit into the stimulus-response
program. Many hard-headed psychologists have fought shy of such matters, and some have flatly
denied them any place in scientific psychology. But let us see.

  S ---> R

Suppose we are looking out on a city street during the noon hour. We see numbers of people
who--lunch over, nothing to do till one o'clock!--are standing or walking about, looking at
anything that chances to catch their eye, waving their hands to friends across the street,
whistling to a stray dog that comes past, or congregating about an automobile that has broken
down in the crowded thoroughfare. These people are responding to stimuli, obviously enough,
and there is no difficulty in fitting their behavior into the stimulus-response scheme.

But here comes some one who pays little attention to the sights and sounds of the street, simply
keeping his eyes open enough to avoid colliding with any one else. He seems in a hurry, and
we say of him, "He must have business on hand; he has to keep an appointment or catch a train".
He is not simply responding to the stimuli that come to him, but has some purpose of his own
that directs his movements.

Here is another who, while not in such a hurry, is not idling by any means, since he peers
closely at the faces of the men, neglecting the women, and seems to be looking for some one
in particular; or, perhaps, he neglects men and {70} women alike, and looks anxiously at the
ground, as if he had lost something. Some inner motive shuts him off from most of the stimuli
of the street, while making him extra responsive to certain sorts of stimuli.

Purposive Behavior

Now it would be a great mistake to rule these purposeful individuals out of our psychology.
We wish to understand busy people as well as idlers. What makes a man busy is some inner purpose
or motive. He still responds to present stimuli--otherwise he would be in a dream or trance
and out of all touch with what was going on about him--but his actions are in part controlled
by an inner motive.

To complete the foundations of our psychology, then, we need to fit purpose into the general
plan of stimulus and response. At first thought, purpose seems a misfit here, since--

First, a purpose is an inner force, whereas what arouses a response should be a stimulus, and
typically an external stimulus. We do not wish to drop back into the old "self-activity" psychology,
which thought of the individual as originating his acts from within himself. But if we could
show that a purpose is itself an inner response to some external stimulus, and acts in its
turn as a "central stimulus" to further reactions, this difficulty would disappear.

Second, while a typical reaction, like the reflex or the simple reaction of the experiment,
is prompt and over with at once, a purpose persists. It keeps the busy man, in our illustration,
hurrying all the way down the street and around the corner and how much farther we cannot say.
It is very different from a momentary response, or from a stimulus that arouses a momentary
response and nothing more.

Third, what persists, in purposive behavior, is the tendency {71} towards some end or goal.
The purposeful person wants something he has not yet got, and is striving towards some future
result. Whereas a stimulus pushes him from behind, a goal beckons to him from ahead. This element
of action directed towards some end is absent from the simple response to a stimulus.

In short, we have to find room in our stimulus-response psychology for action persistently
steered in a certain direction by some cause acting from within the individual. We must find
room for internal states that last for a time and direct action. In addition, we sometimes,
though not always, need to find room for conscious foreknowledge of the goal towards which
the action is directed.

"Purpose" is not the best general term to cover all the internal factors that direct activity,
since this word rather implies foresight of the goal, which demands the intellectual ability
to imagine a result not present to the senses. This highest level of inner control over one's
behavior had best be left for consideration in later chapters on imagination and will. There
are two levels below this. In the middle level, the individual has an inner steer towards a
certain result, though without conscious foresight of that result. At the lowest level, we
can scarcely speak of the individual as being directed towards any precise goal, but still
his {72} internal state is such as to predispose him for certain reactions and against other
reactions.

The lowest level, that of organic states, is typified by fatigue. The middle level, that of
internal steer, is typified by the hunting dog, striving towards his prey, though not, as far
as we know, having any clear idea of the result at which his actions are aimed. The highest
level, that of conscious purpose, is represented by any one who knows exactly what he wants
and means to get.

No single word in the language stands out clearly as the proper term to cover all three levels.
"Motives" would serve, if we agree at the outset that a motive is not always clearly conscious
or definite, but may be any inner state or force that drives the individual in a given direction.
"Wants" or "needs" might be substituted for "motives", and would apply better than "motives"
to the lowest of our three levels. "Tendencies", or "tendencies to reaction", carries about
the right meaning, namely that the individual, because of his internal state, tends towards
a certain action. "Determining tendencies" (perhaps better, "directive tendencies") is a term
that has been much used in psychology, with the meaning that the inner tendency determines
or directs behavior. Much used also are "adjustment" and "mental set", the idea here being
to liken the individual to an adjustable machine which can be set for one or another sort of
work. Often "preparation" or "readiness for action" is the best expression.

Organic States that Influence Behavior

Beginning at the lowest of our three levels, let us observe not even the simplest animal, but
a single muscle. If we give a muscle electric shocks as stimuli, it responds to each shock
by contracting. To a weak stimulus, the response is weak; {73} to a strong stimulus, strong.
But now let us apply a long series of equal shocks of moderate intensity, one shock every two
seconds. Then we shall get from the muscle what is called a "fatigue curve", the response growing
weaker and weaker, in spite of the continued equality of the stimuli. How is such a thing possible?
Evidently because the inner condition of the muscle has been altered by its long-continued
activity. The muscle has become fatigued, and physiologists, examining into the nature of this
fatigue, have found the muscle to be poisoned by "fatigue substances" produced by its own activity.
Muscular contraction depends on the oxidation of fuel, and produces oxidized wastes, of which
carbon dioxide is the best known; and these waste products, being produced in continued strong
activity faster than the blood can carry them away, accumulate in the muscle and partially
poison it. The "organic state" is here definitely chemical.

This simple experiment is worth thinking over. Each muscular contraction is a response to an
electric stimulus, but the force of the contraction is determined in part by the internal state
of the muscle. Fatigue is an inner state of the muscle that persists for a time (till the blood
carries away the wastes), and that predisposes the muscle towards a certain kind of response,
namely, weak response. Thus the three characteristics of purposive behavior that seemed so
{74} difficult to fit into the scheme of stimulus and response are all here in a rudimentary form.

But notice this fact also: the inner condition of muscular fatigue is itself a response to
external stimuli. It is part and parcel of the total muscular response to a stimulus. The total
response includes an internal change of condition, which, persisting for a time, is a factor
in determining how the muscle shall respond to later stimuli. These facts afford, in a simple
form, the solution of our problem.

Before leaving the muscle, let us take note of one further fact. If you examine the "fatigue
curve" closely, you will see that a perfectly fresh muscle gains in strength from its first
few responses. It is said to "warm up" through exercise; and the inner nature of this warming
up has been found to consist in a moderate accumulation of the same products which, in greater
accumulation, produce fatigue. The warmed-up condition is then another instance of an "organic
state".

There will be more to say of "organic states" when we come to the emotions. For the present,
do not the facts already cited compel us to enlarge somewhat the conception of a reaction as
we left it in the preceding chapters? Besides the external response, there is often an internal
response to a stimulus, a changed organic state that persists for a time and has an influence
on behavior. The motor response to a given stimulus is determined partly by that stimulus,
and partly by the organic state left behind by just preceding stimuli. You cannot predict what
response will be made to a given stimulus, unless you know the organic state present when the
stimulus arrives.

Preparation for Action

At the second level, the inner state that partly governs the response is more neural than chemical,
and is directed {75} specifically towards a certain end-result. As good an instance as any
is afforded by the "simple reaction", described in an earlier chapter. If the subject in that
experiment is to raise his finger promptly from the telegraph key on hearing a given sound,
he must be prepared, for there is no permanent reflex connection between this particular stimulus
and this particular response. You tell your subject to be ready, whereupon he places his finger
on the key, and gets all ready for this particular stimulus and response. The response is determined
as much by his inner state of readiness as by the stimulus. Indeed, he sometimes gets too ready,
and makes the response before he receives the stimulus.

The preparation in such a case is more specific, less a general organic state, than in the
previous cases of fatigue, etc. It is confined for the most part to the nervous system and
the sense organ and muscles that are to be used. In an untrained subject, it includes a conscious
purpose to make the finger movement quickly when the sound is heard; but as he becomes used
to the experiment he loses clear consciousness of what he is to do. He is, as a matter of fact,
ready for a specific reaction, but all he is conscious of is a general readiness. He feels
ready for what is coming, but does not have to keep his mind on it, since the specific neural
adjustment has become automatic with continued use.

Examples of internal states of preparedness might be multiplied indefinitely, and it may be
worth while to consider a few more, and try out on them the formula that has already been suggested,
to the effect that preparation is an inner adjustment for a specific reaction, set up in response
to some stimulus (like the "Ready!" signal), persisting for a time, and predisposing the individual
to make the specified reaction whenever a suitable stimulus for it arrives. The preparation
may or may not be conscious. It might be named "orientation" or "steer", with the meaning that
{76} the individual is headed or directed towards a certain end-result. It is like so setting
the rudder of a sailboat that, when a puff of wind arrives, the boat will respond by turning
to the one side.

The runner on the mark, "set" for a quick start, is a perfect picture of preparedness. Here
the onlookers can see the preparation, since the ready signal has aroused visible muscular
response in the shape of a crouching position. It is not simple crouching, but "crouching to
spring." But if the onlookers imagine themselves to be seeing the whole preparation--if they
suppose the preparation to be simply an affair of the muscles--they overlook the established
fact that the muscles are held in action by the nerve centers, and would relax instantly if
the nerve centers should stop acting. The preparation is neural more than muscular. The neural
apparatus is set to respond to the pistol shot by strong discharge into the leg muscles.

What the animal psychologists have called the delayed reaction is a very instructive example
of preparation. An animal is placed before a row of three food boxes, all looking just alike,
two of them, however, being locked while the third is unlocked. Sometimes one is unlocked and
sometimes another, and the one which at any time is unlocked is designated by an electric bulb
lighted above the door. The animal is first trained to go to whichever box shows the light;
he always gets food from the lighted box. When he has thoroughly learned to respond in this
way, the "delayed reaction" experiment begins. Now the animal is held while the light is burning,
and only released a certain time after the light is out, and the question is whether, after
this delay, he will still follow the signal and go straight to the right door. It is found
that he will do so, provided the delay is not too long--how long depends on the animal. With
rats the delay cannot exceed 5 seconds, with cats it can reach 18 {77} seconds, with dogs 1
to 3 minutes, with children (in a similar test) it increased from 20 seconds at the age of
fifteen months to 50 seconds at two and a half years, and to 20 minutes or more at the age
of five years.

Rats and cats, in this experiment, need to keep their heads or bodies turned towards the designated
box during the interval between the signal and the release; or else lose their orientation.
Some dogs, however, and children generally, can shift their position and still, through some
inner orientation, react correctly when released. The point of the experiment is that the light
signal puts the animal or child into a state tending towards a certain result, and that, when
that result is not immediately attainable, the state persists for a time and produces results
a little later.

Preparatory Reactions

In the delayed reaction, the inner orientation does little during the interval before the final
reaction, except to maintain a readiness for making that reaction; but often "preparatory reactions"
occur before the final reaction can take place. Suppose you whistle for your dog when he is
some distance off and out of sight. You give one loud whistle and wait. Presently the dog swings
around the corner and dashes up to you. Now, what kept the dog running towards you after your
whistle had ceased and before he caught sight of you? Evidently he was directed towards the
end-result of reaching you, and this directing tendency governed his movements during the process.
He made many preparatory reactions on the way to his final reaction of jumping up on you; and
these preparatory reactions were, of course, responses to the particular trees he had to dodge,
and the ditches he had to jump; but they were at the same time governed by the inner state
set up in him by your {78 } whistle. This inner state favored certain reactions and excluded
others that would have occurred if the dog had not been in a hurry. He passed another dog on
the way without so much as saying, "How d'ye do?" And he responded to a fence by leaping over
it, instead of trotting around through the gate. That is to say, the inner state set up in
him by your whistle facilitated reactions that were preparatory to the final reaction, and
inhibited reactions that were not in that line.

A hunting dog following the trail furnishes another good example of a directive tendency. Give
a bloodhound the scent of a particular man and he will follow that scent persistently, not
turning aside to respond to stimuli that would otherwise influence him, nor even to follow
the scent of another man. Evidently an inner neural adjustment has been set up in him predisposing
him to respond to a certain stimulus and not to others.

The homing of the carrier pigeon is a good instance of activity directed in part by an inner
adjustment, since, when released at a distance from home, he is evidently "set" to get back
home, and often persists and reaches home after a very long flight. Or, take the parallel case
of the terns, birds which nest on a little island not far from Key West. Of ten birds taken
from their nests and transported on shipboard out into the middle of the Gulf of Mexico and
released 500 miles from home, eight reappeared at their nests after intervals varying from
four to eight days. How they found their way over the open sea remains a mystery, but one thing
is clear: they persisted in a certain line of activity until a certain end-result was reached,
on which this line of activity ceased.

One characteristic of tendencies that has not previously been mentioned comes out in this example.
When a tendency has been aroused, the animal (or man) is tense and {79} restless till the goal
has been reached, and then quiets down. The animal may or may not be clearly conscious of the
goal, but he is restless till the goal has been attained, and his restlessness then ceases.
In terms of behavior, what we see is a series of actions which continues till a certain result
has been reached and then gives way to rest. Introspectively, what we feel (apart from any
clear mental picture of the goal) is a restlessness and tenseness during a series of acts,
giving way to relief and satisfaction when a certain result has been reached.

A hungry or thirsty animal is restless; he seeks food or drink, which means that he is making
a series of preparatory reactions, which continues till food or drink has been found, and terminates
in the end-reaction of eating or drinking.

What the Preparatory Reactions Accomplish

The behavior of a hungry or thirsty individual is worth some further attention--for it is the
business of psychology to interest itself in the most commonplace happenings, to wonder about
things that usually pass for matters of course, and, if not to find "sermons in stones", to
derive high instruction from very lowly forms of animal behavior. Now, what is hunger? Fundamentally
an organic state; next, a sensation produced by this organic state acting on the internal sensory
nerves, and through them arousing in the nerve centers an adjustment or tendency towards a
certain end-reaction, namely, eating. Now, I ask you, if hunger is a stimulus to the eating
movements, why does not the hungry individual eat at once? Why, at least, does he not go through
the motions of eating? You say, because he has nothing to eat. But he could still make the
movements; there is no physical impossibility in his making chewing and swallowing movements
without the presence of food. {80} Speaking rationally, you perhaps say that he does not make
these movements because he sees they would be of no use without food to chew; but this explanation
would scarcely apply to the lower sorts of animal, and besides, you do not have to check your
jaws by any such rational considerations. They simply do not start to chew except when food
is in the mouth. Well, then, you say, chewing is a response to the presence of food in the
mouth; and taking food into the mouth is a response to the stimulus of actually present food.
The response does not occur unless the stimulus is present; that is simple.

Not quite so simple, either. Unless one is hungry, the presence of food does not arouse the
feeding reaction; and even food actually present in the mouth will be spewed out instead of
chewed and swallowed, if one is already satiated. Try to get a baby to take more from his bottle
than he wants! Eating only occurs when one is both hungry and in the presence of food. Two
conditions must be met: the internal state of hunger and the external stimulus of food; then,
and then only, will the eating reaction take place.

Hunger, though a tendency to eat, does not arouse the eating movements while the stimulus of
present food is lacking; but, for all that, hunger does arouse immediate action. It typically
arouses the preparatory reactions of seeking food. Any such reaction is at the same time a
response to some actually present stimulus. Just as the dog coming at your whistle was responding
every instant of his progress to some particular object--leaping fences, dodging trees--so
the dog aroused to action by the pangs of hunger begins at once to respond to present objects.
He does not start to eat them, because they are not the sort of stimuli that produce this response,
but he responds by dodging them or finding his way by them in his quest for food. The responses
that the hungry dog makes to other objects than {81} food are preparatory reactions, and these,
if successful, put the dog in the presence of food. That is to say, the preparatory reactions
provide the stimulus that is necessary to arouse the end-reaction. They bring the individual
to the stimulus, or the stimulus to the individual.

What we can say about the modus operandi of hunger, then, amounts to this: Hunger is an inner
state and adjustment predisposing the individual to make eating movements in response to the
stimulus of present food; in the absence of food, hunger predisposes to such other responses
to various stimuli as will bring the food stimulus into play, and thus complete the conditions
necessary for the eating reaction. In general, an aroused reaction-tendency predisposes the
individual to make a certain end-reaction when the proper stimulus for that reaction is present;
otherwise, it predisposes him to respond to other stimuli, which are present, by preparatory
reactions that eventually bring to bear on the individual the stimulus required to arouse the
end-reaction.

Let us apply our formula to one more simple case. While reading in the late afternoon, I find
the daylight growing dim, rise and turn on the electric light. The stimulus that sets this
series of acts going is the dim light; the first, inner response is a need for light. This
need tends, by force of habit, to make me turn the button, but it does not make me execute
this movement in the air. I only make this movement when the button is in reaching distance.
My first {82} reaction, rising from my chair, is preparatory and brings the button close enough
to act as a stimulus for the hand reaction. The button within reach is not by itself sufficient
to arouse the turning reaction, nor is the need for light alone sufficient. The two conditions
must be present together, and the preparatory reaction is such that, given the need, the other
condition will be met and the reaction then aroused.

What a Tendency Is, in Terms of Nerve Action

Very little need be added to our neural conception of a reaction in order to get a satisfactory
conception of a tendency to reaction. Principally, we must add this fact, that a nerve center
aroused to activity does not always discharge instantly and completely into the muscles, or
into some other center, and come to rest itself. It does so, usually, in the case of a reflex,
and in other momentary reactions; as when A makes you think of B, and B at once of C, and so
on, each thought occupying you but a moment. But a tendency means the arousing of a nerve center
under conditions which do not allow that center to discharge at once. The center remains in
a condition of tension; energy is dammed up there, unable to find an outlet.

We have already seen what the conditions are that cause this damming up of energy. The center
that is aroused tends to arouse in turn some lower motor center, but by itself does not have
complete control over that lower center, since the lower center also requires a certain external
stimulus in order to arouse it to the discharging point. Until the proper external stimulus
arrives to complete the arousal of the lower center, the higher center cannot discharge its energy.

When there is an "organic state" present, such as hunger or thirst, this may act as a persistent
stimulus to the sensory nerves and through them to the higher center in {83} question; and
then we can readily understand how it is that the center remains active until the organic state
is relieved. But where there is no such persistent organic stimulus, as there can scarcely
be in the case of the bloodhound or of the man hurrying to a train or seeking in the crowd
for a friend, there we have to suppose that a center, once aroused to activity and prevented
from complete discharge, remains active by virtue of energy dammed up in itself. There is pretty
good physiological evidence that this sort of thing is a fundamental fact; for there are certain
rhythmical reflexes, like scratching or stepping, that, when started going by a momentary sensory
stimulus, keep it up for a time after the stimulus has ceased. There seems to be no doubt that
a nerve center, once aroused, may stay aroused for a time.

The "dammed-up energy" here is not to be confused with the "stored energy" spoken of under
the head of reactions. We said, in that connection, that a stimulus released energy stored
in the organism. That, however, was potential energy, dormant within the organism till aroused;
but what we have here in mind is active or kinetic energy. Stored energy is like that of coal
in the bin; dammed-up energy is like that of steam in the boiler.

Dammed-up energy in the nerve centers accounts for the persistence of a tendency to reaction
after the stimulus has ceased. It accounts for the "delayed reaction" and similar cases. But
how shall we account for preparatory reactions? We have a nerve center in an active state,
tending to discharge into a certain lower motor center, but unable to do so because a peripheral
stimulus is necessary, in addition, in order to arouse this lower center. Then we find the
higher center discharging into other lower centers, and so giving rise to preparatory reactions.
More precisely, what we find is that the higher center facilitates the response {84} of certain
lower centers to their proper peripheral stimuli, while inhibiting the response of other lower
centers to their appropriate stimuli. This is the same sort of thing that we observe in all
control exerted by a higher center over a lower. It means that the higher center, besides its
main line of connection with the lower center that will give the end-reaction, has minor lines
of connection with certain other lower centers; some of these centers it facilitates and others
it inhibits. These connections between the main and the subordinate centers may have been established
by inborn nature, or by previous training, as will be explained in later chapters.

The action of the main center on the subordinate centers concerned in executing preparatory
reactions does not relieve the tension in the main center. The dammed-up energy stays there
till the proper stimulus is procured for arousing the end-reaction, and then escapes through
its main channel of discharge, and the main center then finally comes to rest.

It may fairly be urged that no violence has been done to the general conception of a reaction
by these additions, and also that with the additions the notion of a reaction has room for
tendencies or inner adjustments. So that we conclude that stimulus-response psychology is adequate
to the job, and will do justice to all forms of human behavior. It has a place for sensations,
perceptions and thoughts, as we saw in the preceding chapter, and it has a place also for purposes,
desires and motives generally.

Motives

In the present chapter, desirous of "keeping close to the ground", we have said little of distinctively
human motives. That will come later. In general, a motive is a tendency towards a certain end-result
or end-reaction, a tendency which is itself aroused by some stimulus, and which {85} persists
for a time because its end-reaction is not at once made. The end-reaction is not made at once
because it can only be aroused by an appropriate stimulus, acting in conjunction with the motive.
But the motive, persisting in its inner activity, facilitates reactions to certain stimuli
and inhibits others. The reactions it facilitates are preparatory to the end-reaction, in that
they provide the necessary conditions for that reaction to occur, which means that they bring
to bear on the individual the necessary stimulus which can arouse the end-reaction. The restlessness
that characterizes an individual driven by an inner motive gives way to rest and satisfaction
when the end-result is reached.

Motives range from the primitive or primal, like hunger, to the very advanced, such as zeal
for a cause. They range from the momentary, illustrated by the need for more light in reading,
to the great permanent forces of life, like amour propre and esprit de corps. But the permanent
motives are not always active; they sleep and are awakened again by appropriate stimuli.

In everyday speech we are apt to use the words "motive" and "reason" interchangeably, as in
asking some one what his "motive", or what his "reason" is for doing so and so. A motive, however,
is not necessarily a reason, nor a reason a motive. A reason is thought-out and conscious,
which a motive need not be. On the other hand, a reason does not become a motive unless it
takes hold of us and arouses a genuine tendency towards the planned result. You may prove to
me, logically, the desirability of a course of action, but your reasons do not necessarily
make me desire it. You can give a child excellent reasons for studying his lessons, but you
have to stir some real motive of child life in order to get action. In the highest type of
conduct, to be sure, motive and reason pull together, reason showing the way to the goal at
which motive is aimed.

CHAPTER V

NATIVE AND ACQUIRED TRAITS

SOME RESPONSES ARE PROVIDED BY NATURE, WHILE OTHERS HAVE TO BE LEARNED BY EXPERIENCE

John Doe is a strongly built man, over six feet high, with big bones and muscles, erect, vigorous,
with plenty of color in his face, dark-haired, blue-eyed, clean-shaven, with a scar on his
cheek, broad face and large ears. He is easy-going, even-tempered, fond of children and also
of women, rather slangy and even profane in his talk, has a deep, sonorous voice and can carry
the bass in a chorus. He is handy with tools, can drive or repair an automobile, is a fairly
good carpet salesman, but much prefers out-of-door work. Rather free in spending his money,
he has never run into debt except on one occasion, which turned out badly for him. Which of
these traits of John Doe are native and which are acquired? How far are his physical, mental
and moral characteristics the result of his "original nature" and how far have they been ingrained
in him or imposed upon him by his training and environment?

The distinction between native and acquired is clearest in the field of anatomy. Hair color
and eye color are evidently native, and so, in the main, is the size of the body, though undoubtedly
growth may be stunted by poor nutrition, and the individual fail to reach his "natural" height
and weight. On the other hand, scars, tan, and the after-effects of disease or injury, are
evidently acquired. Of movements, the native character of the reflexes has already been noted,
and it is clear that skill in handling tools or {90} managing the voice is learned, though
the individual may have a natural aptitude for these performances. Temperament and emotional
traits we usually think of as belonging to a man's "nature", though we have to admit that a
naturally cheerful disposition may be soured by ill treatment. On the other hand, while we
reckon habits, such as profanity, or free spending, or an erect carriage, as belonging with
the acquired traits, we know that some natures are prone to certain habits, and other natures
to other habits. Thus the effects of "nature" and "experience" are almost inextricably interwoven
in the behavior of an adult person.

Difficult as it certainly is to separate the native from the acquired in human action, the
attempt must be made. We cannot dodge so fundamental a problem. Scientifically it is important
as the starting-point of a genetic study; we must know where the individual starts in order
to understand the course of his development. Practically it is important because there is reason
to believe that native traits are deeply seated and not easily eradicated, even though they
can be modified and specialized in different ways. If a habit is not simply a habit, but at
the same time a means of gratifying some natural tendency, then it is almost imperative to
find a substitute gratification in order to eliminate the habit. The individual's nature also
sets limits beyond which he cannot be brought by no matter how much training and effort; and
this is true of mental development as well as of physical.

The Source of Native Traits

"Native" means a little more than "congenital." A child may be born blind, having been infected
by disease germs shortly before birth; he may be congenitally an idiot because of head injury
during a difficult birth; or his mentality may have been impaired, during his uterine life,
by {91} alcohol reaching his brain from a drunken mother. Such traits are congenital, but acquired.
Native traits date back to the original constitution of the child, which was fully determined
at the time when his individual life began, nine months before birth. The "fertilized ovum",
formed by the combination of two cells, one from each of the parents, though microscopic in
size and a simple sphere in shape, somehow contains the determiners for all the native or inherited
traits of the new individual.

It is very mysterious, certainly. This microscopic, featureless creature is already a human
individual, with certain of its future traits--those that we call "native"--already settled.
It is a human being as distinguished from any other species, it is a white or colored individual,
male or female, blonde or brunette, short or tall, stocky or slender, mentally gifted or deficient,
perhaps a "born" musician or adventurer or leader of men. These and all other native traits
are already determined and latent within it; and the only question, regarding such traits,
is whether the environment is going to be such as to enable this young individual to live and
mature and unfold what is latent within it.

Reactions Appearing at Birth Must Be Native

For the first few months of the individual's existence, sheltered as it is within the mother's
body, there is no chance for any acquisition, except of certain abnormalities such as were
alluded to above. What occurs during this prenatal period is natural development, not learning
or any effect of experience. The traits displayed by the new-born child are, accordingly, native
traits. His breathing, crying, starting at a noise, squirming, stretching, grasping, sucking
and swallowing, and other movements made from birth on, are to be counted as native reactions,
that is to say, as {92} reactions executed by sensory, muscular and nervous machinery that
have become ready for use by the mere process of natural growth. This is the first and clearest
sign of a native trait, that it shall appear at birth.

Reactions That Cannot Be Learned Must Be Native

But native traits continue to make their appearance as the child's development proceeds after
birth. Inherited anatomical traits, like stature and build, hair color, beard, and shape of
nose, though certainly determined by native constitution, do not fully make their appearance
till maturity. In fact, what does maturity mean, except that the natural characteristics have
finally reached their complete development? And it is as true of internal structure as of external,
that natural development, far from being complete at birth, keeps on till maturity. The neurones
continue to grow, and their synapses in the nerve centers to become closer knit, just by virtue
of natural growth; and thus reflex arcs, and other reaction machinery, one by one reach the
ready-to-use stage during the individual's growing-up, especially during the first few years.
With the growth to a functional condition of their sensori-neuro-muscular mechanisms, mental
and motor reactions that are native, though not present at birth, make their appearance. The
native intelligence of the child gradually unfolds, likewise his special native "gifts" and
his inherited emotional and impulsive traits.

Of course it is more difficult to make sure that a trait is native when it does not appear
till some time after birth, for the chance of acquiring it by a process of learning has to
be taken into account. If you can so control the conditions under which the young individual
grows as to eliminate the possibility of learning a certain act, then you can {93} make sure
whether the act is acquired or provided by the native constitution.

Experimental Detection of Native Reactions

Take the question whether birds learn to fly or simply come to fly when their natural development
has gone far enough. The newly hatched bird cannot fly; its muscles are not strong enough,
its wings are not feathered, and its nerve mechanism for coördinating the wing movements has
still some growth to make before being ready for use. But, under ordinary conditions, the young
bird has some chance to learn flying, by watching the old birds fly and by trying and gradually
getting the motion. The old birds, after a time, push the young ones from the nest and seem,
to our eyes, to be teaching them to fly. Experiment enables us to decide the question. One
of the earliest experiments in animal psychology was made by Spalding in 1873. He took newly
hatched birds from the nest and shut each one separately in a little box that gave it no chance
to stretch its wings or to see other birds fly. Here he fed and cared for them till the age
at which flying usually begins, and then released them. Off they flew, skilfully managing wings
and tail, swooping around the trees and soon disappearing from sight. A very successful experiment!--and
conclusive. The little birds had had no chance to learn to fly, yet they flew. Flying must
have come to them in the natural course of growth.

Compare with this experiment another one no less successful, though it turned out differently.
To discover whether the song of the oriole is fixed by nature or learned by imitation, Scott
took some little ones, just hatched, and brought them up away from older birds. After a time,
when growth had advanced to a certain stage, the birds began {94} to sing. The elementary notes
and rattles characteristic of the oriole made their appearance, but were combined in unusual
ways, so that the characteristic song of the oriole did not appear, but a new song. When these
birds had grown up in the laboratory, other new-hatched orioles were brought up with them,
and adopted this new song; so that the laboratory became the center for a new school of oriole
music. The experiment showed that the elements of the oriole's song were provided by nature,
while the combination of these elements was acquired by imitation.

Probably this last is about the result one would get in the analogous case of human speech,
if a similar experiment should be tried on children. Without an experiment, we have certain
facts that point to a conclusion. The child uses his vocal organs from birth on; and before
he reaches the age when he imitates the speech of others, he produces various vowels and consonants,
and even puts them together into simple compounds, as "da-da" and "goo-goo." So far, deaf children
do about the same as others, affording additional evidence that so much of speech is native.
To get real speech, however, further combinations of the speech movements must be made, and
the combinations (words) must have meaning attached to them. These higher achievements are
evidently the result of learning, since the child uses the words that it hears spoken, and
attaches the same meanings to them as people do about it. The child comes to speak the language
of those about it, without regard to the speech of its ancestors. His "native language" is
therefore acquired, though the elements of vocal utterance are truly native, and apparently
are alike all over the world without regard to the various languages spoken.

{95}

Is Walking Native or Acquired?

As another example of this same general problem of distinguishing native from acquired reactions,
and of the kind of evidence that throws light on the problem in the absence of direct experiment,
let us consider the child's walking. Does the child learn to walk, or does it simply come to
walk when its natural development has gone far enough? We think the child learns to walk because
it begins very imperfectly and usually takes several weeks before it can be described as really
walking of itself. We even think we teach it to walk, though when we examine our teaching we
soon convince ourselves that we do not know how we walk, and that what we are doing with the
baby is to stimulate and encourage him to walk, protect him from hurting himself, etc., rather
than teaching him as we later teach the child to write. An experiment to settle the matter
might be conducted along the lines of Spalding's experiment on the young birds. We might prevent
the baby from making any attempt to walk till it had fully reached the normal age for walking,
and then turn it loose and see whether it walked of itself.

Such an experiment has never been made under strict laboratory conditions; but here is a well-attested
case that approximates to an experiment. A little girl of seven months, a very active child,
seemed to want to get on her feet; but the doctor decided that her feet were too small to use,
and directed that she be put back in long dresses. For four months she was kept in long dresses,
and great care was exercised never to place her on the floor without them. Then, one day, she
was set down without her dress, and immediately up she got and walked; and from that moment
she was very agile on her feet.

Another rather different case, but tending towards the {96} same conclusion, is that of a little
girl who, in contrast to the preceding, gave her parents some anxiety because, up to the age
of seventeen months, she wouldn't walk. She would stand holding on, but not trust herself to
her feet alone. One noon her father came in from his work and, removing his cuffs, laid them
on the table. The little girl crept to the table, and raised herself to a standing position,
holding on to the table. She then took a cuff in one hand, and inserted the other hand into
it, thus, for the first time, standing unsupported. She put on the other cuff in like manner,
and then marched across the room, as proud as you please. For a few days she could walk only
with cuffs, but after that was able to dispense with them. There are a few other cases, differing
in details, but agreeing on the main point, that the baby walked well on its first trial and
went through nothing that could properly be interpreted as a process of learning.

It would really be very surprising if the human infant were left to learn locomotion for himself,
while all other animals have this power by nature. Just because the human infant matures slowly,
and learns a vast deal while maturing, is no reason for overlooking the fact that it does mature,
i.e., that its native powers are gradually growing and reaching the condition of being ready
for use. The most probable conception of "learning to walk," in the light of the evidence,
is about as follows. At the age when the child's bones and muscles have become strong enough
for walking, the nerve connections for coördinating this complex movement have also just about
reached the stage of development when they are ready for business. The numerous synapses in
the nerve centers that must be traversed by nerve currents in order to arouse the muscles to
this particular act are not, we may suppose, all ready at the same instant, and it takes some
little time for them to pass from {97} the stage when they will first conduct to the stage
when, having grown more, they conduct perfectly. In other words, the neural mechanism for walking
can function imperfectly before it can function perfectly. It takes several weeks of growth
to pass from the barely functional condition to the fully functional condition; and it is during
these weeks that the child seems to be learning to walk, while really his exercise of the partially
developed neural mechanisms has no effect except to hasten their growth to some extent.

Universality as a Criterion of Native Reactions

The fundamental sign or criterion of a native trait, in accordance with what we have been saying,
is that it shall make its appearance when there has been no chance to acquire it through experience.
This is the one perfect criterion; but unfortunately it cannot always be applied, especially
with a slowly maturing and much-learning species such as the human. We need other criteria,
and one of some value is the criterion of universality.

Consider, for example, the attraction between the sexes, and ask whether this represents a
native tendency, or whether each individual acquires it, as he does his "native language",
by learning from his elders. Before the body reaches sexual maturity, there has been abundant
opportunity for the quick-learning child to observe sex attraction in older people. Yet it
is highly improbable that the liking for the other sex which he begins to show strongly in
youth is simply an acquired taste. It is improbable because the attraction between the sexes
is so universal not only among mankind but among birds and mammals and, indeed, practically
throughout the animal kingdom.

Fighting is a similar case. Not so universal as the sex instinct, it still appears almost universally
among birds and mammals.

{98}

The human individual is an animal, and some of his native traits are universal among animals.
He is a vertebrate, and some of his traits, though not present in all animals, are universal
among vertebrates. He is a mammal, with mammalian traits; a primate, with primate traits; a
man with human traits; a Chinaman or Indian or European with racial traits; belongs to a more
or less definite stock or breed within the race, and possesses the traits that are common to
members of that stock; and the same with family traits. The criterion of universality, in the
light of these facts, comes down to this: that when all individuals having the same descent
show a trait in common, that trait is to be regarded as belonging to their native constitution--unless
evidence can be brought forward to the contrary.

Smoking is universal among many Malay peoples, but we know, as a historical fact, that it was
introduced among them after the discovery of America, not very many generations ago. Superstition
is universal among some peoples, but we see the superstitious beliefs and practices taught
by the older to the younger generation. Similarly with any specific language. It may very well
be true in such cases that the universal practice appeals to some native tendency of the people;
but the specific practice is handed down by tradition and not by inheritance.

Some Native Traits Are Far from Being Universal

Though the universality of a trait creates a certain presumption in favor of its being native,
the opposite is not always true, for a trait may be native and yet appear in only a fraction
of those who have a common descent. Eye color is certainly native, and yet one of two brothers
may have blue eyes and the other brown. Mental deficiency runs in families, but usually some
members of such families have {99} normal mentality. Genius is almost certainly a native trait,
but it is the reverse of universal. The fact is that, along with certain traits that appear
in all, the native constitution of a stock provides also for traits that appear only sporadically.
Enough has been said to show that the criterion of universality is one that needs to be applied
with judgment.

Why Acquired Traits Differ from One Individual to Another

Acquired traits are on the whole much less universal, much more individual, than native traits.
They are readjustments of the individual to environmental conditions; and, as the environment
varies, so the adjustments vary, even when native traits are the same. Acquired traits are
often specializations of the native traits, as any specific language is a specialization of
the vocal utterances that are native and common to all men, and as the peculiar gait of an
individual is a specialization of the universal walking movement. The gait differs with the
environmental differences to which the individual has adapted himself, and will be different
in one who has been accustomed to walk over rough ground and in one whose walking has been
done on the city streets.

Acquired traits are not independent of native, but are developed on the basis of the native
traits. They are acquired not by laying aside native tendencies and working out something entirely
new, but by acting in accordance with the native tendencies and making such readjustments as
the environment demands. The acquisition of mental traits is accomplished by the process of
learning, and we shall later have abundant occasion to examine it in more detail.

{100}

What Mental Traits Are Native?

For the present, let us simply take a brief survey of the mental field, and notice what types
of reactions are native and what acquired. On the motor side, the reflexes are native, while
habitual and skilled movements are acquired. On the sensory side, nature provides the use of
the sense organs and the sensations immediately resulting from their stimulation. The baby
responds to touch, warmth, cold, sound and light as soon as it is born, or practically so,
and undoubtedly has the corresponding sensations. In other words, the rudiments of seeing,
hearing, etc., are provided by nature. But when we say, "I see a dog" we mean more than that
we are getting certain visual sensations; we mean that we see a known object or known sort
of object. This implies recognition of the object, either as an individual thing or as one
of a class; and this the baby can scarcely be supposed to do at first. He sees the dog to the
extent that he responds by visual sensations to the light coming from the dog, but not to the
extent that he recognizes the dog as a dog. In short, the meanings of sensations are acquired,
though the sensations themselves are native.

Things come to be known by use of the senses, and when thus known are not only recognized when
present, but also remembered and thought of when they are not present to the senses. Such memories
and items of knowledge, dependent as they are on experience, are to be reckoned among the acquired
reactions. Ideas or conceptions of things also belong here.

Of the emotions, some are called "primary" or native--anger and fear are examples--while others
result from the compounding of these primary emotions and are therefore acquired. As people
and things come to be known, emotional reactions become attached to them, and give what {101}
are often named "sentiments", such as love for this person, contempt for that one, family pride,
patriotism. These sentiments, bound up as they are with knowledge and ideas, are certainly
acquired.

Closely akin to the primary emotions are the native impulses, as the impulse to eat, to cry,
to laugh, to escape from danger, to resist external compulsion and to overcome obstacles. The
native impulses are the raw material out of which the numerous acquired desires of child and
adult are formed. One sort of native impulse is the impulse to notice or pay attention to certain
sorts of stimuli. These native interests of the child give birth to the various specialized
interests of the adult. The baby's attention to a bright light represents a native interest;
the older child's fixing his eyes on a dark brown piece of chocolate represents an acquired
interest which has developed in a way that is easy to understand.

Finally, we must count among the native traits of the individual his inherited aptitudes for
certain kinds of work. One child shows a natural aptitude for music, another for acting, another
for mathematics, another for mechanical things, another for language, and so on. As any of
these "natural gifts" is present in some degree in nearly all members of the human family,
and not to anything like the same degree in animals, they are the characteristically human
traits. It is on the basis of such native aptitudes that each individual proceeds, through
the processes of learning, to build up his various acquired abilities, such as the ability
to sing, to speak a certain language, to add, to work with tools, to perform athletic feats,
and to take part in social activities of various sorts.

Our next task will be to examine more closely the native equipment of man, and after that to
take up the process of learning, which is the way reactions are acquired. First the native,
then the acquired. The acquired is based upon {102} the native. Acquired reactions are indeed
so numerous that we cannot attempt even to list them all, let alone examine each one separately;
but we can at least study the way in which they are acquired. Native reactions are much less
numerous, so that the student may hope to obtain a fairly comprehensive survey of this field,
though, of course, without much detail.

The general plan of this book, then, is as follows. The Norman women would go to Granville weekly
to dispose of their fowls, eggs, fruit, vegetables and fish. They would seat at the stalls, and ply
their needles when not serving the customers. They had a very stern look and never condescended
to solicit any person to deal with them-a mode of behaviour which the butchers, fishmongers, fruiterers,
and greengrocers would try to imitate.
 Finally, there are several chapters devoted to such topics as imagination, reasoning
and will, which are ways in which the individual utilizes his whole equipment, native and acquired,
in meeting the exigencies of life.

CHAPTER VI

INSTINCT

CONDUCT AS DETERMINED BY NATIVE REACTION-TENDENCIES

Instinct is native behavior. It is contrasted with habit, knowledge, or anything in the way
of learned reactions. When the mother wasp gathers a store of food suitable for young wasps,
lays eggs beside the food and covers the whole with a wall of mud, we know that her behavior
is instinctive because she has had no possible chance to learn from older wasps. She has never
seen a wasp's nest made, for when the last preceding crop of nests was being made she was herself
an unhatched egg. Therefore, she cannot possibly know the use of the nest with its eggs and
store of food. She has no "reason" for building the nest, no ulterior purpose, but is impelled
to build the nest, simply and solely for the sake of doing just that thing. Thus instinct is
contrasted with calculated or reasoned action as well as with learned action. Calculated action
is based on knowledge of cause and effect, and this knowledge is acquired by the individual
in the course of his experience; but instinct is not based on the individual's experience,
but only on his native constitution.

The case of the baby eating is exactly the same as that of the wasp. The baby has not learned
to eat, he knows nothing of the use of food and therefore has no ulterior purpose in eating,
he does not reason about the matter, but eats simply because hunger is a native impulse to
eat. {106} Eating is an end in itself to a hungry baby, and not a means to some further end;
and that is what eating continues to be even to the hungry adult, however much he may learn
about the use of food in maintaining life. From a broad philosophical point of view, instinct
may be seen to work towards some great end, such as the preservation of the individual or the
propagation of the race, but from the individual's own point of view, it is directed simply
towards the performance of some particular act, or the accomplishment of some particular result.

If instinct, as a collective term, means native behavior, "an instinct" is a unit of such behavior.
Or, it is some unit of native organization that equips the individual to behave in a certain
way. Different species of animals have different instincts, i.e., they are differently organized
by nature. The differences of organization lie partly in the equipment of sense organs, partly
in the equipment of motor organs, and partly in the nerves and nerve centers that, being themselves
aroused by way of the sense organs, in turn arouse the motor organs.

The dependence of instinct on sensory equipment becomes clear when we think of animals possessing
senses that human beings lack. The instinct of dogs to follow the scent depends on their keen
sense of smell. Bees have something akin to a sense of taste in their feet, and follow their
own trails by tasting them. Fishes have special sense organs along their sides that are stimulated
by water currents, and it is in response to this stimulus that the fish instinctively keeps
his head turned upstream.

The dependence of instinct on motor equipment is still more obvious. The flying instinct of
birds depends on the possession of wings, and the swimming instinct of the seal depends on
the fact that his limbs have the peculiar form of flippers. The firefly instinctively makes
flashes of light, {107} and the electric eel instinctively discharges his electric organ and
gives his enemy a shock.

But the core of an instinct is to be sought in the nerve centers, since it is there that the
coördination of the muscles is accomplished. A wing or flipper would be of no use unless its
muscles were excited to action by the nerve centers, and it would be of very little use unless
the nerve centers were so organized as to arouse the muscles in a certain combination, and
with a certain force and rhythm. In terms of the nervous system, an instinct is the activity
of a team of neurones so organized, and so connected with muscles and sense organs, as to arouse
certain motor reactions in response to certain sensory stimuli.

The Difference Between an Instinct and a Reflex

What we have said regarding instinct thus far could equally well be said of reflex action.
A reflex is a native reaction, and it is taken care of by a team of neurones in the way just
stated. We might speak of a reflex as "instinctive", using this adjective as equivalent to
"native"; but we should shrink for some reason from speaking of the pupillary reflex to light
as an instinct, or of the "knee jerk instinct", or the "swallowing instinct", or the "flexion
instinct". There is some difference between the typical reflex and the typical instinct, though
it is not very obvious what the difference is.

The typical reflex is a much simpler act than the typical instinct, but it is impossible to
separate the two classes on this basis. At the best, this would be a difference of degree and
not of kind. Among reflexes, some are simpler than others, but even the simplest is compound
in the sense of being a coördinated movement. The knee jerk is simpler than the flexion reflex,
and this is simpler than the scratch {108} reflex, which consists of a rapid alternation of
flexion and extension by one leg, while the other is stiffly extended and supports the trunk.
Coughing, which would be called a reflex rather than an instinct, consists of a similar alternation
of inspiration and forced expiration, and swallowing consists of a series of tongue, throat
and gullet movements. These compound reflexes show that we cannot accept the simple definition
that is sometimes given for an instinct, that it is a compound of reflexes. Such a definition
would place coughing and swallowing among the instincts, and so do violence to the ordinary
use of the word. In point of complexity, we find a graded series ranging from the pupillary
reflex at one extreme to the nesting or mating instinct at the other, and no sharp line can
be drawn on this score between the reflexes and the instincts.

Another distinction has been attempted on the basis of consciousness. Typically, it may be
said, a reflex works automatically and unconsciously, while an instinct is consciously impulsive.
The reflex, accordingly, would be an unconscious reaction, the instinct a conscious reaction.
But this distinction also breaks down on examination of cases. The pupillary reflex, to be
sure, is entirely unconscious. But the flexion reflex is a little different. When unimpeded,
it occurs so promptly that we are scarcely aware of the painful stimulus before the reaction
has occurred. But let the reaction be hindered--either voluntarily or, for instance, by the
foot being seized and held--and a strong conscious impulse is felt to pull the leg away; so
that here the flexion reflex would belong among the instincts, according to the proposed distinction.

Similar remarks would apply equally well to coughing, since a strong impulse to cough is felt
if the coughing movement is checked. Sneezing, a protective reflex, is usually a slow reaction,
giving time for a conscious impulse to {109} sneeze before the reaction takes place. The same
is true of scratching and of swallowing, and of a number of other reflexes. In short, it is
impossible to draw a satisfactory line between reflexes and instincts on the basis of conscious
impulse.

These cases point the way, however, to what is probably the best distinction. It was when the
flexion reflex was delayed that it began to look like an instinct, and it was because sneezing
was a slow response that it had something of the character of an instinct. Typically, a reflex
is a prompt reaction. It occurs at once, on the occurrence of its stimulus, and is done with.
What is characteristic of the instinct, on the contrary, is the persisting "tendency", set
up by a given stimulus, and directed towards a result which cannot be instantly accomplished.

An Instinct Is a Native Reaction-Tendency

We would propose, then, to consider an instinct as an inner adjustment, or tendency to reaction.
It is this, rather than just a reaction. When a stimulus promptly arouses a reaction, and that
ends the matter, we speak of reflex action--provided, of course, the connection between stimulus
and response is native. But when a stimulus sets up a tendency to a reaction that cannot be
immediately executed, or towards an end-result which cannot immediately be reached, and when
the tendency so aroused persists for a time in activity, and gives rise to preparatory reactions,
then we speak of instinct.

The "broody" hen makes a good picture of instinct. When in this condition she responds to a
nestful of eggs, as she does not at other times, by sitting persistently on them and keeping
them covered. She is in a certain "organic state" that facilitates this response. In the absence
{110} of any nestful of eggs, she shows a peculiar restless behavior that indicates to one
who knows hens that this one "wants to set." The tendency that has been awakened in her cannot
be satisfied by any momentary act, but persists and governs her actions for a considerable period.

The nesting instinct of birds affords a still more complete example. The end-result here, the
finished nest, cannot be instantly had, and the pair of birds keep on gathering materials and
putting them together until this end-result is present before their eyes. It is not necessary
to suppose that the birds have any plan or mental image of what the nest is to be like; probably
not. But their state, in the nest-building season, is such that they are impelled to build,
and the tendency is not quieted till the completed nest is there.

The mating instinct, in unsophisticated members of the human species, is another perfect example.
So is the hunting instinct in a dog; when this instinct is aroused, the animal makes a lot
of movements of various sorts, responses to various particular stimuli, but evidently these
movements are not sufficient to quiet the tendency, for they continue till the prey is captured.
The behavior of a gregarious animal when separated from his fellows shows the same sort of
thing. Take a young chick out of the brood and fence it away from the rest. It "peeps" and
runs about, attacking the fence at different points; but such reactions evidently do not bring
satisfaction, for it varies them until, if a way out of the inclosure has been left, it reaches
the other chicks, when this series of acts terminates, and gives way to something quite different,
such as pecking for food.

The persisting tendency does not produce the series of movements all by itself, but, as was
explained in speaking of tendencies in general, coöperates with sensory stimuli in producing
them. Clearly enough, the nest-building bird, {111} picking up a twig, is reacting to that
twig. He does not peck at random, as if driven by a mere blind impulsion to peck. He reacts
to twigs, to the crotch in the tree, to the half-built nest. Only, he would not react to these
stimuli unless the nesting fit were on him. The nest-building tendency favors response to certain
stimuli, and not to others; it facilitates certain reactions and inhibits others. It facilitates
reactions that are preparatory to the end-result, and inhibits others.

Fully and Partially Organized Instincts

Insects afford the best examples of very highly organized instincts. Their behavior is extremely
regular and predictable, their progress towards the end-result of an instinct remarkably straightforward
and sure. They make few mistakes, and do not have to potter around. By contrast, the instincts
of mammals are rather loosely organized. Mammals are more plastic, more adaptable, and at the
same time less sure; and this is notably true of man. It would be a mistake to suppose that
man has few instinctive tendencies; perhaps he has more than any other creature. But his instinctive
behavior has not the hard-and-fast, ready-made character that we see in the insects. Man is
by all odds the most pottering, hem-and-hawing of animals. Instinct does not lead him straight
to his goal, but makes him seek this way and that till he finds it. His powers of observation,
memory and thought are drawn into the game, and thus instinct in man is complicated and partly
concealed by learning and reasoning.

For example, when an insect needs a nest, it proceeds in orderly fashion to construct a nest
of the pattern instinctive to that species of insect; but when a man needs a home, he goes
about it in a variable, try-and-try-again {112} manner, scheming, experimenting, getting suggestions
from other people, and finally producing--a dugout, a tree house; a wigwam, a cliff dwelling--something
that differs altogether from many other human habitations, except in the fact that it is a
habitation and thus satisfies a need which is undoubtedly as instinctive in man as in the insect.

A fully organized instinct is one where the necessary preparatory reactions are linked up closely
with the main reaction-tendency, so that, once the main tendency is aroused to activity, the
preparatory reactions follow with great sureness. The main team of neurones is closely connected
with the subordinate teams that give the preparatory reactions; and these connections do not
have to be acquired by experience and training, but are well formed by native growth. Just
the right preparatory reactions are linked to the main tendency, so that the whole series of
acts is run off with great regularity.

In a loosely organized instinct, the main tendency is not firmly linked with any specific preparatory
reactions, but is loosely linked with a great many preparatory reactions, and so gives quite
variable behavior, which, however, leads on the whole towards the main goal.

While a creature under the spell of a fully organized instinct is busy, one driven by a loosely
organized instinct may be better described as restless. He tries this thing and that, and goes
through the kind of behavior that is called "trial and error". A closely knit instinct, then,
gives a perfectly definite series of preparatory reactions, while a loosely organized instinct
gives trial and error behavior. We shall see later how trial and error furnishes a starting
point for learning, and how, in an animal that can learn, those among the trial-and-error reactions
that are actually preparatory to the end-result become firmly attached to the main tendency,
so that what was by native constitution a loosely {113} organized instinct may become, through
the individual's experience, a closely organized habit. If a man has occasion to build himself
many homes, he comes, after a while, to build almost as uniformly and surely as an insect.

Instincts Are Not Ancestral Habits

The theory of inheritance of acquired traits has gone by the board; biologists no longer accept
it. Such traits as an individual's tanned skin acquired by living in the tropics, horny hands
acquired by hard labor, immunity to measles acquired by having measles, big muscular development
acquired by gymnastics, are not transmitted by heredity to the children of the individual who
acquired these traits.

Nor are acquired behavior traits transmitted by heredity. Learned reactions are not so transmitted,
knowledge is not, acquired skill is not. Learn to cook, to typewrite, or pilot an airplane
as perfectly as possible, and your child will still have to learn all over again. You may make
your experience valuable to him by teaching him, but not in the way of heredity.

Language affords a good test of this matter. A child's parents, and all his ancestors for many
generations, may have spoken the same language, but that does not relieve the child of the
necessity of learning that language. He does not inherit the language habits of his ancestors.
He has no native tendency to say "dog", or "chien", or "hund", on sight of this animal. Here
in America we have children born of stocks that have spoken foreign languages for many generations;
but English becomes their "native tongue" after a generation or two here, that is to say, as
soon as the child hears English from infancy.

In short, there is no likelihood whatever that any instinct {114} ever originated out of a
habit or learned reaction. If we could believe it had so originated, that would furnish an
easy explanation of the origin of an instinct; but it is contrary to all the known facts.

Instincts Not Necessarily Useful in the Struggle for Existence

Some of the best-known instincts, such as feeding or mating--or hunting, or flight from danger,
or the hibernation of frogs--are so essential for the survival of the individual or the propagation
of the next generation that we tend to assume that all instinctive behavior has "survival value",
value, that is, towards the survival of the individual or of the race. But this is an assumption,
and it seems not to be borne out by actual observations of instinctive behavior, since, along
with the definitely useful reactions, others occur that would seem to have no survival value.
Perhaps the crowing of the rooster at dawn would be a case in point; or the elaborate bowing
that is observed in some kinds of birds. And there are the less definite, rather random movements
of squirming, kicking, running about, wrinkling up the face, etc., that appear in young animals.
We may well hesitate before definitely asserting that these movements are of no use for survival,
but at least their use is not obvious, and there is no reason for assuming that all instinctive
behavior must necessarily be useful.

To be sure, the "struggle for existence" would eliminate individuals who behaved in ways that
seriously handicapped them in procuring food or escaping from enemies; and therefore we should
not expect to find really harmful instincts preserved in the race. But a mode of behavior might
be neutral in this respect, or even slightly disadvantageous, and yet not be weeded out unless
the struggle for existence were very keen.

{115}

The main point is that the psychologist should take instinctive behavior as he finds it, and
not allow himself to be prejudiced by the assumption that instinct must necessarily be useful.
That has to be shown in each case, not assumed at the outset.

The So-called Instincts of Self-preservation and of Reproduction

You will hear it stated, by some, that there are just two instincts, and that all instinctive
behavior belongs under the head of one or the other of these two. The one is the instinct to
preserve one's individual life, and the other is the instinct to propagate the species. Mating,
nesting and care of the young come under the reproductive instinct, while feeding, flight from
danger, and shunning extreme heat or cold are modes of self-preservation. This seems logical
enough, but it is very bad psychology. It amounts to a classification of native reactions from
an external point of view, without any consideration of the way the individual is organized.

Perhaps the most obvious objection to these two supposedly all-inclusive instincts is found
in what has just been said, to the effect that some instinctive behavior has no known survival
value. This amounts to saying that some instincts do not serve either the preservation of the
individual or the propagation of the species; and such a statement is probably true, especially
of human instincts.

But even if this objection should not hold, there is another, more radical one. Neither of
these two big "instincts" is a behavior unit in any sense. Take the "instinct of self-preservation",
for example. It would certainly have to include both feeding and escape from danger. But feeding
and flight from danger do not belong in a single series {116} of acts; they are two distinct
series, and represent two distinct tendencies. So distinct are they that, as we shall see in
the next chapter, they are antagonistic. If the danger-avoiding tendency is aroused, the whole
feeding and digestive activity is checked for the time being. The two instincts are antagonistic,
in their actual operation; throw one into action, and you throw the other out. It is only from
an external point of view that the two can be classed together; in the organization of the
individual they are entirely separate.

Not much different is the "instinct of reproduction". In birds, to be sure, there is a fairly
continuous series of reactions, that begins with mating, continues with nesting, laying eggs
and incubating them, and ends in the care of the young birds. But in mammals there is no such
continuous series of reproductive acts, but mating comes to a close and an interval elapses
in which there is no behavior going on that has anything to do with reproduction.

Before giving a detailed list of the various human instincts, we shall do well to consider
emotion, which is closely bound up with instinct.

CHAPTER VII

EMOTION

VARIOUS ORGANIC STATES, AND THE CONSCIOUS STATES THAT GO WITH THEM

Joy, sorrow, fear, anger, amusement, disgust and curiosity illustrate the meaning of the term
"emotion". An emotion is a "moved" or stirred-up state of mind. Or, since almost any such state
of mind includes also elements that are cognitive, like recognition of present objects or memories
of the past, we might better speak of emotion as the stirred-up-ness present in a state of
mind. The emotional part of the total state may be so strong as to overshadow all other components,
or it may have less intensity down to zero.

Such is emotion from the introspective point of view; but it can also be observed objectively,
and in fact there is more to say about it objectively than introspectively. What appears to
introspection as the scarcely analyzable state of anger appears to the external observer as
clenched fists, flushed face, labored breathing, tense muscles, loud voice, and many other
describable details. Anger is a state of the organism, or state of the individual, rather than
simply a state of mind.

We shall have a more comprehensive definition, then, if we substitute "state of the individual"
for "state of mind", and say that emotion is a stirred-up state of the individual. It is a
conscious state, however; an "unconscious emotion" would be practically a contradiction in
terms. Not but that a person may be angry without knowing it. He may be {119} "unconscious
of the fact" that he is angry; which simply means that he is not introspectively observing
himself and analyzing his mental state. But it is impossible that his organic state shall be
all stirred up and his mental state meanwhile perfectly calm and intellectual. In short, an
emotion is a conscious stirred-up state of the organism.

Organic States That Are Not Usually Classed as Emotions

Something was said before about "organic states", under the general head of tendencies to reaction.
Fatigue was an example. Now we could include fatigue under the term, "stirred-up state of the
organism"; at least, if not precisely "stirred-up", it is uneasy. It is a deviation from the
normal or neutral state. Also, it is often a conscious state, as when we speak of the "tired
feeling"; not a purely cognitive state, either--not simply a recognition of the fact that we
are fatigued--but a state of disinclination to work any longer. Though fatigue is thus so much
like an emotion that it fits under our definition, it is not called an emotion, but a sensation
or complex of sensations. After hard muscular work, the state of the muscles makes itself felt
by "fatigue sensations", and the sum total of these, coming from many different muscles, makes
up the complex sensation of fatigue. After prolonged mental work, there may be fatigue sensations
from the eyes and perhaps from the neck, which is often fixed rigidly during strenuous mental
activity; and there are perhaps other obscure fatigue sensations originating in other organs
and contributing to the total sensation which we know as mental fatigue, or as general fatigue.

Many other organic states are akin to emotion in the same way. The opposite of fatigue, the
"warmed-up" condition, brought on by a certain amount of activity after {120} rest, is a case
in point. It is a deviation from the average or neutral condition, in the direction of greater
readiness for activity. The warmed-up person feels ready for business, full of "ginger" or
"pep"--in short, full of life. The name "euphoria" which means about the same as "feeling good",
is given to this condition. Drowsiness is another of these emotion-like states; but hunger
and thirst are as typical examples as any.

How These Organic States Differ from Regular Emotions

Now why do we hesitate to call hunger, fatigue and the rest by the name of emotions? For two
reasons, apparently. There are two salient differences between an organic state such as hunger,
and an emotion such as anger.

Hunger we call a sensation because it is localized; we feel it in the region of the stomach.
Thirst we localize in the throat, muscular fatigue in the fatigued muscles, and there are several
other organic states that come to us as sensations from particular organs. This is not entirely
true of drowsiness or euphoria, but it is still less true of the emotions, which we feel as
in us, rather than in any part of us. We "feel mad all over", and we feel glad or sorry all
over. It is true that, traditionally, the heart is the seat of the emotions, which means, no
doubt, that they are felt in the region of the heart more than elsewhere; and other ancient
"seats", in the bowels or diaphragm, agree to this extent that they point to the interior of
the trunk as the general location where the emotions are felt. But at best the location of
emotions is much less definite than that of the sensations of fatigue or hunger.

The second difference between the emotions and the other organic states comes to light when
we notice their causes. Thirst, as an organic state, is a lack of water resulting {121} from
perspiration, etc.; hunger as an organic state results from using up the food previously eaten;
fatigue results from prolonged muscular activity. Each of these organic states results naturally
from some internal bodily process; while, on the contrary, the exciting cause of an emotion
is usually something external which has nothing directly to do with the internal state of the
body. Here I am, perfectly calm and normal, my organic state neutral, when some one insults
me and throws me into a state of rage; this queer state seems to be inside me, specially in
the trunk. Now how can the sound of the insulting person's voice produce any change in my insides?
Evidently, by way of the auditory nerve, the brain and lower centers, and the motor nerves
to the interior. While, then, organic states of the hunger class result directly from internal
physiological processes, the organic state in an emotion is aroused by the brain, the brain
itself being aroused by some stimulus, usually external.

The Organic State in Anger

But perhaps we are going too fast in assuming that there is any peculiar internal state in
emotion. Possibly our subjective localization of anger in the trunk is all wrong, and everything
there is going on as usual. At least, the question is squarely before us whether or not there
is any internal bodily response in emotion.

Suppose we have a tame cat, that knows us well, and, after feeding her a good meal containing
some substance that is opaque to the X-rays, suppose we place her on a table and pass X-rays
through her body, so as to get a visible shadow of the stomach upon the plate of the X-ray
machine. Well and good; the cat is contentedly digesting her meal, and the X-ray picture shows
her stomach to be making rhythmical churning movements. In comes a fox {122} terrier and barks
fiercely at the cat, who shows the usual feline signs of anger; but she is held in position
and her stomach kept under observation--when, to our surprise, the stomach movements abruptly
cease, not to begin again till the dog has been gone for perhaps fifteen minutes. The churning
movements of the intestine cease along with those of the stomach, and, as other experiments
show, even the gastric juice stops flowing into the stomach. The whole business of digestion
halts during the state of anger. So anger is an organic state, without doubt. At least in cats--but
the same is found to be true of man, and hence the excellent rule not to get angry on a full
stomach.

Stomach-inhibition is not the only internal response during anger. He was a changed boy. His conceit,
coolness, audacity all gone replaced with a manner  grave and silent. He spent most days in
Kenrick's study now. The kindly Kenrick permitted this still. There are yet
other and more curious changes that have recently been discovered by the physiologists.

Glandular Responses During Emotion

Thus far, we have been considering muscular responses, but now we must turn our attention to
the glands. The glands are often affected during emotion, as witness the shedding of tears
in grief, sweating in anger, the dry mouth during fear due to inhibition of the salivary glands,
and the stoppage of the gastric juice during anger, as just noted. These particular glands
all pour out their secretions either upon the skin or upon the mucous membrane of the mouth,
stomach, etc.; and such secretion is called "external" in distinction from the "internal secretion"
of certain other glands which may be called the glands of internal secretion or the "endocrine
glands". Internal secretions are {123} discharged into the blood vessels, and carried by the
blood to all parts of the body, and they have important effects on the activity of various organs.

Of the endocrine glands, we will mention only two, which are known to play an important part
in mental life.

The thyroid gland, situated in the lower part of the neck, is necessary for normal brain activity.
Without its internal secretion, brain activity is very sluggish.

The adrenals, two little glands located near the kidneys (whence their name, though they have
nothing to do with the kidney in function), have a close connection with such emotions as anger.
In the normal or neutral state of the organism, the adrenal secretion oozes slowly into the
blood, and has a tonic influence on the heart and muscles. But let an anger stimulus occur,
and within a few seconds the adrenals are secreting rapidly; all the organs soon get a big
dose of the adrenal secretion, and some of them are strongly affected by it. It hastens and
strengthens the action of the heart, it causes the large veins inside the trunk to squeeze
the blood lagging there back to the heart; and by these two means greatly quickens the circulation.
It also affects the liver, causing it to discharge large quantities of stored sugar into the
blood. Thus the muscles of the limbs get an unusual quantity of their favorite fuel supplied
them, and also, by the increased circulation, an unusual quantity of oxygen; and they are enabled
to work with unusual energy. The adrenal secretion also protects them in some way against fatigue.

While the adrenal secretion is thus exerting a very stimulating influence on the limb muscles,
it is having just the opposite effect on the digestive organs; in fact it is having the effects
described above as occurring there during anger. These inhibitory effects are started by the
stomach nerves, but are continued by the action of the adrenal juice {124} on the stomach walls.
The rapid secretion of the adrenal glands during anger is itself aroused by the nerve running
to this gland.

The Nerves Concerned in Internal Emotional Response

There is a part of the nervous system called the "autonomic system", so called because the
organs it supplies--heart, blood vessels, stomach, intestines and other internal organs, possess
a large degree of "autonomy" or independence. The heart, it will be remembered, beats of itself,
even when cut off altogether from any influence of the nerve centers; and the same is true
in some measure of the other internal organs. Yet they are subject to the influence of the
nerve centers, which reinforce and inhibit their activity. Each internal organ has a double
supply of nerves, one nerve acting to reinforce the activity of the organ and the other to
inhibit it; and both the reinforcing and the inhibiting nerves belong to the autonomic system.

The autonomic is not separate from the main nervous system, but consists of outgoing axons
from centers in the cord and "medulla" (part of the brain stem). It has three divisions, one
from the medulla, one from the middle reach of the cord, and one from the lower part of the
cord; and these three divisions are related to three different emotional states. The upper
division, from the medulla, favors digestion by promoting the flow of gastric juice and the
churning movements of the stomach; and at the same time it seems to favor the comfortable,
rather lazy state that is appropriate for digestion. The middle division (often called the
"sympathetic", though the name is rather misleading to a student of psychology, as it has nothing
to do with "sympathy") checks digestion, hastens the heart beat, and stimulates the adrenal
glands to rapid secretion, thus giving {125} rise to the organic condition of anger. The lower
division has to do with the bladder, rectum and sex organs, and is active during sex excitement,
for one thing.

The lower centers in the medulla and cord that give rise to the autonomic nerves are themselves
much under the influence of the higher, cerebral centers. Thus appetite for food, and the flow
of gastric juice, can be aroused by the sight of good food, or by hearing or reading about
food, or even by merely thinking of food; and both anger and sex appetite can be aroused in
corresponding ways.

We should notice right here the antagonism that exists between the middle division of the autonomic
and the other two. Suppose the upper division is active, as in comfortable digestion, when
an angering stimulus supervenes; then, as we have seen, digestion halts, the upper autonomic
is shunted out of action by the middle division. In the same way, sex appetite is shunted out
by anger.

The Emotional State as a Preparatory Reaction

An emotion is often spoken of as a disturbance of the normal quiet state, and as if it represented
a breakdown of the organism's machinery. Anger or fear is often a nuisance in civilized life,
and any strong emotion is apt to disturb mental work or skilled manual work. But if we think
ourselves back into a primitive condition of life, when anger means a fight, we see that the
organic response in anger makes a first-class preparation for the fight. Rapid circulation,
abundant muscular fuel, protection from fatigue--these are all positively useful; and the halting
of digestion is useful also in relieving the circulation from taking care of an activity that
can afford to wait.

What we have been calling the "organic state in anger" occurs also in fear of the strong type
(as distinguished from {126} fear paralysis), and in certain other states that are not exactly
either fear or anger, such as the state of a football player before the game, or the state
of a student about to take an examination. It is the state of excitement or of being "all keyed
up". So far as known, the organic response (including the adrenal secretion) is the same in
these various instances of excitement: anger, fear, zeal and so on. When an individual is in
this organic state, his muscles will work harder and longer than is otherwise possible; and
thus are explained those remarkable cases of extraordinary strength and endurance in great
emergencies, as in escaping from a fire or from a bombarded city.

The fear-anger state of the organism, being certainly a state of preparedness for attack or
defense, suggests the following generalization: "Any emotion represents internal preparation
for some type of overt action." This holds good, at least, for food appetite and sex appetite.
Regarding the other emotions, we know too little of the internal responses that may occur,
to judge whether or not they have any utility as preparatory reactions.

"Expressive Movements," Another Sort of Preparatory Reactions

Though we know little of any internal response in many of the emotions, we almost always find
some characteristic external movement, such as smiling, scowling, pouting, sneering, sobbing,
screaming, shouting or dancing. By aid of such "expressive movements" we are sometimes able
to judge the emotional state of another person. But what is the sense of these movements? One
fine requisite coat, of stout cloth and fine manufacture, a uniform for which the public authority
supplies the design, is what every child or young man should wear; private people who participate
in this matter are suspect from the start.
 Perhaps they are just odd tricks of instinct--for we agreed in the preceding chapter
not to assume all instinctive responses to be useful. The Ababda of Egypt,is ruled by a traditional
chief. The chief is paid a subsidy for safeguarding travellers from the Bedouin robbers. It
is only a portion of the road -dues.According to Joseph Van Russeggar who visited this coutry
1836 the population is about 40,000 The Ababda of Nubia amalgmated
with their traditional enemies Bisharin, and they were a powerful
nation.

They speak Arabic because of their contact with Egypt, but the south south-eastern portion
of the tribe still speak Beja dialect.They won't speak this before strangers as they believe that
his will bring ruin to them. Those who live near Nile have much fellah
blood.

They claim to be Arab origin through their sheikhs. They dress like the fellahin unlike their kinsmen
the Busharin Hadendoa, who go naked.The latter have fine physique but they are small with of an
average height of 5ft or a little above except the Sheikh clan. Their complexion is rather
red than black, with angular features, straight nose and a luxuriant hair. They are honest in
money matters and hospitable. They have their own pride so that they
wont beg.

But they are trecherous and faithless.Ababda was poor before the British occupation in Egypt.
They settles in Nubia, where their main livelihood is agriculture and fishing. Some live by charcol
burning, wood-gathering and trading in gums and drugs (senna leaves). They live in small huts
made with hurdles and mats and some even live in natural caves as their ancestors.
 Such movements, directly
useful in certain simple situations, become linked up with analogous situations in the course
of the {128} individual's experience. It was named Buffalo Creek and it was part of a series
of villages that was started by them.

Ketchum is the historian who has 25 chapters of information in the
first volume of the Authentic and Comprehensive History of Buffalo.

It wasn't until the 24th chapter that he finds the Senecas stopped and lived in Buffalo Creek.
 Try this experiment: pretend to be angry--it is not hard!--go through the
motions of being angry, and notice what sensations you get. Strong poetical imagery describes
his style, including the happiest of expressions, although his style is peaceful, pure, and fluid,
as clear as water. Almost all writers of creative literature have a similar habit, of corrupting
the conversations of the destitute with primitiveness and grammatical errors which are as accurate
as they are elegant. Hawthorne's excellent taste and moral code did not allow him to develop this
habit. 

We've been here for almost two days, and we still don't know how long we'll have to wait for
the drama to start. Which is why we have to be patient, and only occasionally allow our time
honored tradition of complaining.
It has taken us ten days in these tiny little boats to get here from Liverpool. I wish I could
ask those who disdain us to consider that, when you think about crossing
the ocean in a luxury cruise liner.

Do you even think about us poor missionaries and the hardships that we endure? I have got to
tell you though. When I tell the other passengers on board where I am headed they raise their
eyebrows and look politely amused.

I took a chance and asked my roommate if she had ever been on Le
Petit Nord.

Oh how I wish you could have seen her face.

I'm sure it would have been the same as if I asked if she had ever been exiled in Siberia! Which
is why I decided that it was not in my best interest to be so curious and lust for information. Just
in case I learn more than I might want to know. I'll try to write you again when I get on the
coastal steamer. I heard that it makes the journey to St. Antoine once ever fortnight during
the summer months. Till then, au revoir.
Run-by-Guess, June 15
The steamer for the north left two whole days before I arrived at
the pier at St. John's. So I was stuck there for twelve days.

I wonder if all the babies at the Orphanage will die before I arrive on the next boat? Will
I take the next boat back and be in England before the coastal steamer comes south to get me? Disagreeing
emotions upset my unhappy soul, but "on and always on!"
The rural inhabitants of the island are tremendously proud of the railroad here. Just before my
arrival a daily service and been inaugurated. Before now, the passenger trains only ran three times
a week. They don't run the trains on Sunday either. With so much time on my hands I thought
it would be good to spend some of my free time going across the island and seeing the Southern
part of the country. There was a chance I could catch my boat by chance on the return journey.
I am compelled by the truth to add that I am wiser, yet sadder woman. I left St. Johns one evening
at six o'clock, due to arrive at my destination at eight o'clock
the next night.

There is no hurry on this train. You can wait calmly and relaxed for a whole hour while a very
simple meal is made for you. If youâre not hungry, this is fun interlude in the incessant rush
of a busy modern life. But if by chance Nature has given you a moderate appetite, that hour
is way to long.
I laid low the first night. I thought it all went well. My fellow passengers showed no signs
of there being anything wrong or unusual. Around noon the next day a big and long jolt made
the curious among us to look from the window. The luggage car, tender, and engine were derailed.
As the speed of the trains on the island never go above twenty-five miles an hour, such little
squabbles that occur from time to time didn't ruffle the calmness of those concerned. Accepting the
delay I decided to alight and explore the country.

Although the metric system is more convenient, American students will find it easier to bring an

The extensive writings of Mr. Ruskin on the subject of Northern Italy's
art singles him out among other writers for his venturing to investigate
and write on this extremely engrossing topic of great interest for
the architect, as well as himself.

One need not agree with all of
Mr. Ruskin's theories or admire his drawings unconditionally to find
real value in his books. Students of architecture will find "The Stones
of Venice" to be required reading. It should take precedence in beginning
an architect's library. The "startling of the thunderclap" was preceded by an accustomed proclamation, anecdotic
the offender, and alms a accolade of 50l. for his apprehension. He was not "hurried abroad
to Carlisle," but advisedly taken to London on December 12; advised at Bow Street, adjourned three
times, and assuredly committed; and beatific to Carlisle, area he was approved on August 15,
1803.
Three indictments were adopted adjoin him: the aboriginal for accomplishment a bill of barter for 20l.,
fatigued by Alexander Augustus Hope on John Crump, payable to George Wood; the additional for
a agnate bill for 30l.; and the third for counterfeiting Colonel
Hope's autography to bamboozle the Post-office.

The Cumberland board did not "declare their abhorrence to adhere him for accomplishment a frank," that
not getting a basic offence. I infer, also, that it was one for which he was not tried. He
was bedevilled on the aboriginal indictment; the cloister rose anon afterwards the board had
accustomed their verdict; and the captive was alleged up for acumen
at eight the next morning.

Trying a man beneath book of afterlife for a carriageable felony, is adverse to all practice.

Mary's misfortunes induced the sympathising accessible to catechumen her into a accessory heroine.
She seems to accept been a common-place person, with baby claims to the appellation of "The
Beauty of Buttermere." A cotemporary annual says, "she is rather gap-toothed and somewhat pock-marked."
And Mr. De Quincey, afterwards acquainted her acceptable figure, says, "the announcement of her
aspect was generally disagreeable."
"A lady, not actual conscientious in her adornment of facts, acclimated to acquaint an chestnut
of her which I achievement was exaggerated.

Some acquaintance of hers, as she affirmed, in aggregation with a
ample party, visited Buttermere a day or two afterwards that on which
Hatfield suffered; and she protested that Mary threw on the table,
with an absolute gesture, the Carlisle cardboard absolute an busy
annual of the execution."--P. 204.

Considering the analysis she had received, it is not absurd that her love, if she anytime had
any for a fat man of forty-five, was angry into hatred; and it was not to be accepted that her aftertaste
would accumulate down the appearance of such feeling. When Hatfield was advised at Bow Street,
Sir Richard Ford, the arch magistrate, ordered the agent to apprehend aloud a letter which he
accustomed from her. It was:
"Sir,--The man whom I had the accident to marry, and who has broke me and my age-old and black parents,
consistently told me that he was the Hon. Colonel Hope, the next brother to the Earl of Hopetoun.

Lawless Court, Rochford, Essex .-- A most extraordinary is usually in a mansion at Rochford,
in accordance with tenants holding what is called "Lawless Court." This court takes place at
midnight, by lantern light in the center of a field on the first Friday after September 29, and is

be bothered by this situation. So at length, he decided to put on a grave calculating face, and faced Mr.
Walter saying, "I'm at a lost on the merits of this fundamental inquiry.

How great must the length of a sheep be to actually be in consideration as a long sheep?"
 Or rather we would say, this new and aggressive vitae runs not from the chapel,

 As the maid withdrew Felice said to Guy
that You need not kneel and weep like a girl.

I want a brave knight as my groom.As a swan will never wed a swallow, I am interested to marry
coward. Show me that you are a brave young man before whose spear men bows like a king. I do not
want any parentage to be proud off. I just want a self-made man. I only need my children to
have their nobleness from the nobleness of a self-made man.A weeping and delicate man is not in
mydreams. A fighting, winning champion is my dream. At the same time
I like the passionate lover Guy the page. He
will dip it into the water discreetly and cautiously, naming it after
them (if the child can handle it and they certify him) and saying
(name) I baptise you.

If they state that the kid is weak, it will be enough to pour water on the child stating "(name)
I baptise you."

The minister is told not to ask certain questions from the child's sponsors. However a conculsion
may be made that he is not required to question if the child is weak, but can baptize the child
by the conventional pouring, unless dipping is requested. Sensibly,
such request should be made before the baptizism so preparations can
be made. 

He spoke in a low drawl as he ushered Ellen into the cabin, his gaze resting on her mother. "Here's
your kid come home."

Ellen sidestepped the man, avoiding his gaze, and carried her bedroll to the corner couch built
of tightly braided sprigs and twine. She paused midway as something hit the floor with a dull
thud. Stooping low, she lifted Jean Isbel's package. She forgot that she had it and quickly drew
the canvas curtain that framed her make-shift bedroom close around her, peeking through the
fabric toward the inner-workings of the cabin for any indication that someone may have noticed.

A
low murmur issued from the doorway, where Ellen's mother was still speaking quietly with the man. A
Mexican woman, a relative of Antonio, and the only servant about the place, remained in her crossed-legged
position beside the fire, stirring the contents of a large iron pot that hung low over the flame. Ellen
eyed the woman, uncertain if she had heard.

She and Ellen did not get along well and few words ever passed between
them.

But Ellen always felt that the woman was more perceptive than she
looked, as she seemed more willing to busy herself with the goings-on
of others as opposed to completing her own duties.

She detested the lazy woman.

   The inside of the cabin mirrored its keepers usual unkempt appearance.

A weathered supply cupboard situated beside the fireplace glared
bitterly into the dark, smoke-filled cabin; one of its doors hanging
at a 45 degree angle exposing the rusted hinge on the bottom.

A strip of bacon hung from the ceiling beside the cupboard, a haunch
   of venison framing the other side.
   
   Toward the center of the cabin, somewhat closer to the door, stood
a crude table and two benches.

Streaks of clouded light showed through the roof where the
   rough-hewn shingles had warped and split.

   Ellen scrunched her nose at the smell of smoke and dry, rotting timber.

   She had long since grown accustomed to the stale, acrid stench of
past cooked meals and almost welcomed the smell of freshly burned
beans that were, no doubt, crusting the bottom of the pot as the flames
lapped greedily at their dinner.

   
   Whatever Ellen had lost during the retrogression of the Jorths, she
   had still managed to maintain her own cleanly habits.

Turning back toward her sleeping space, Ellen straightened her belongings,
pleased with the ordiliness.

Her possessions were limited in number but they were hers and were
painstakingly cared for.

Sitting upon the crude square table that she had constructed herself was a little old-fashioned
walnut-framed mirror, a brush, comb, and a dilapidated ebony cabinet
which contained odds and ends; the sight of which always brought a
smile of derisive self-pity to her lips.

Under the table stood an old leather trunk. It had come with her from Texas, and stored her mother's
clothing and belongings.

Above the couch on pegs hung her scant wardrobe consisting of little more than rags and two dresses.
A tiny shelf held several leather-bound books, their covers and binding
weathered.

With a sigh, Ellen pulled the curtain along the wire and tucked it neatly between the couch
and wall before she set to work tidying up the rest of the cabin.

The Mexican woman lifted her gaze from the fire and watched Ellen
approach with a molded rag pinched between her fingers before she
stood up and slouched sullenly away to her own outside quarters; recognizing
the commencement of Ellen's cleansing ritual.

Ellen was left to the satisfaction of labor, her mind as busy as
her hands.

As she cleaned, swept, and dusted, she heard the occasional mumur
of discussion, the clip-clop of shod horses, and the long, low bellow
of the cattle.

A considerable amount of time elapsed before she was distracted by a tall shadow in the door.

"Howdy, little on. I see ya'll got home all right."

Lifting her gaze, Ellen recognized the superbly built man leaning against the door post. Like
most Texans, he was fair and light featured. His face was weathered from long, laborous hours outdoors
and his long, bristling mustache hid the drooping curl of his lips. But spurred, booted, belted,
and packing a heavy gun low down on his hip, he gave Ellen an entirely new impression. Indeed,
she was seeing everything strangely.

"Hello, Daggs," replied Ellen. "Where's my dad?"

"He's playin' cards with Jackson and Colter. Sure is playin' bad, too, and it's gone to his head."

Ellen
sighed but situated an indiscriminate expression on her face. "Gambling?"

"My child, when did Colonel Jorth ever play for fun?" Daggs chuckled, hooking his thumb in his
pocket. "There's a stack of gold on the table. Reckon your uncle Jackson will win it. Colter's
sure out of luck."

Ellen replaced the broom as Daggs stepped inside the cabin and seated
himself at the table.

His every movement was graceful and unhurried, the slow click of his spurs pronoucing each step.
He laid a rather compelling hand on Ellen's shoulder, drawing her down toward him.

"Come here gal, give us a kiss," he said as he lifted his chin to meet her halfway.
Shrinking back, she offered a soft rejection as she slipped out from
under his grasp, "Daggs, I'm not your girl." 

Undaunted, Daggs snaked
an arm round her, not with violence or rudeness, but with an indolent,
affectionate assurance, at once bold and self-contained. All cancers appear and achieve maximum frequency at
different times in a human's life. Cancer of the stomach appears and attains maximum frequency
before the cancer of the skin. cancer of the uterus and mamma is
more frequent towards the decline of reproductive activity than inlater
years of life.

Rectal cancer is caused mainly in the second and third decades.
It can be proved that the irritation caused by alcohol and tobacco are primary reasons in the
causation of cancer; It is also proved by mdeicine that cancer of the mouth is caused by excessive
drinking and smoking.

A cancer can appear as papillary growth on mucous or skin surface,
as nodule in the substance of organs, or as diffuse thickening of
tubular organs such as the stomach or intestine.

Cancerous tumours cannot be defined and that is precisely the reason why it is difficult to
completely remove them by surgical measures. This has led to the practice of complete removal
of cancerous organs wherever possible.
The disease often spreads across the boundaries of the affected organ
and the epithelial infiltration affects the surrounding parts.

In cancer of the breast the disease often extends to the adjoining
skin, fat and muscles; in cancer of the lips and tongue, the mindible
is also affected, while in cancer of the uterus or intestine the cancer
extends upto the investing pertonium.

Besides affecting adjacent tissues and organs, cancer can also give rise to secondary growths.
These secondary growths are frequently found in the lymph glands nearest to the affected organ.
Examples to justify this can be secondary growths in the neck which are caused by the cancer
of the lips or tongue or throat; those in the axilla are caused by the cancer of the brast;
those along the curvatures of the stomach are cuased by the cancer of the pylorus; and those
in the groin are caused by cancer of the external genitals.
The cancer cells in the lymph vessels can colect so as to fill the lumen and form indurated
cords.

They may even spread at a rapid rate and give rise to secondary nodules
along the lymph vessels.

  The lymphatic network appears like
  a multitude of secondary nodules
  or like diffuse thickening and the skin becomes like coarse leather.

When this condition appears on the wall of the chest it is called
cancer en cuirasse.

Though secondary growths begin to form at a comparatively early period, they are rarely detected
clinically until late in the course of the disease due to dissimination by the blood-stream. 
Many
of the cancer cells which are carried away by the blood or lymph stream undergo necrosis and are
unable to give rise to secondary growths. Secondary growths are actally a faithful representation
of the sturcture of the primary tumor.
Apart from the lymph glands, the chief seats of secondary growths are the liver, lungs, serous
membranes, and bone marrow.
Secondary cancerous growths which develop at a distance from the primary tumor are caused by
the dissemination of cancer cells by the blood stream and are called emboli. Examples of emboli
are secondary growths in the medullary canal of the femur or secondary growths in the diploe of the
skull occuring in advanced cases of cancer of the breast.
 I remember having
heard high Servian officials speculate as to their odds of reviving the ancient empire, so
with the Bulgarians.
At this very moment, I prepare myself to show you the large underbelly
of forces forever moving beneath the Balkan situation. It has to be said that athough
Angelina was not exactly fuming, she certainly seemed irritated. The day had been full of niggles,
lots of little things going wrong: one of her dresses had been badly ripped, the new hat she had
ordered hadn't arrived, lessons were difficult, add to that an unrepeatable list of small
desolations. Thus she let vent to her emotions by crying, fussing and fuming, allowing herself
to wallow in her misery.

Shortly after the tears, when there seemed a light on the horizon,
her cousin Jeannnette Forrest burst inot the room and hugged her.

Jeannette was all smiles and kisses. The
koilon is to us non-manifestation, because they have not unfolded powers which enable us to cognise
it, & it may be the manifestation of a loftier order of LOGOI, utterly beyond our ken. As none
of our investigators can raise his consciousness to the highest plane of our universe, the
Ã¢di-tattva plane, it may be of interest to describe how it is possible for them to see what
may probably be the atom of that plane. That this may be understood it is essential to recall that
the power of magnification by means of which these experiments are conducted is apart from the
faculty of functioning on one or other of the planes. The latter is the result of a slow & gradual
unfoldment of the Self, while the former is merely a special development
of one of the plenty of powers latent in man. As
such, a person should analyze what he did and be sorry for his mistakes before judgment day.
In September, also referred to as Elul, he should force himself of
the frightening justice that awaits all humans. The temple is about 800 feet long.
About a mile and a quarter down the river is the ruins of Carnak, even in the present state overshadow
that of Luxor. One of these ruins is thought to be the temple of Ammon because of Diodoius's
documentation of it being situated on this side of the river. A mile long winding row of sphinxes
paved the way between this temple and the northern entrance of the
temple of Luxor.

This is but one of many extravagant roads into the city, maybe the
largest city ever built, based upon plans as well as the personal
accounts of Dr. Richardson and Mr. Hamilton.

 The lesser consumption of oil in a turbine excluding the
facts of spilling and leakage influences the consideration of the nature of oil to suit with
the purpose that has to be accomplished.Higher the viscosity of the oil, more will be the semi-solid
or the jelly-like presence of the oil. It is also evident that highly viscous oils are not suitable
for turbines.
An optimal and an alternative oil is the use of central gravity oil system instead of furnishing
the oil system with the turbines. But the major consideration should be the effective operation
of the central gravity oiling system since its malfunctioning could
cause irrevocable results.

Proper planning on the design should be made in order to make an
efficient use of such systems.

The major merit in using such a system is the extended life of the oil. This is achieved by
making the oil to settle for a long time before it gets used. This facilitates the use of even
lower grade oils which are free from acidity.
V.OPTIMAL METHOD OF EXAMINING A STEAM TURBINE
[3] Inspired from the concepts by Thomas Franklin.
The most instrumental part of a turbine is a condensing that arrangement that may have a barometric
or jet condenser. These cannot be weighed or measured directly. Even measuring my meter is possible
it cannot afford to give out guarantees in their usage towards test cases. The result of the
amount of steam consumed can be acquired by examining the amount of water condensed and subtracting
the condenser's total outflow.

In the event of turbine being equipped with a barometric jet condenser
the measurement can be made by examining the boiler feed and the initial
and final contents as well.

Surface-condensed turbines gives better mechanisms to measure the steam consumptions when compared
to the systems in which the condensed outlet steam and the circulating water collides each
other. In such systems the condensed steam is to be pumped out to a measuring tank.
For turbines of Parsons single-flow type, the check on rows of the blades is to be done for
checking the irregularities, deposits and for calculating the other differences in true radial
and vertical positions. Tests should not be concluded under a doubt being held. The blade clearances
also should be gaged around the boundaries of the blades to insure average working minimum. 
On
the high pressure end, the dummy rings should be given special attention. They prevent extreme
leakage past the balancing positions. Fig.60 shows a schematic representation of the turbine
for the benefit of novice. A being the cylinder and B is the rotor, so called the spindle
and C being the blade.
 

We had all agreed that as soon as the dinner-bell rang, we would all start off together and make
our for the apple orchard at the top of the hill. We were unlikely to be disturbed here.
I remember this day quite well and how hot that July afternoon had been. We lay amongst the long
grass looking up at the young apples above us. Every now and then we would set our teeth in the
sour middles of those apples that had fallen. We did no more than
taste these unripe apples because we were a afraid of the possible
affects they might have on us if we ate them. Instead of seeking
to evolve some lesson sense in the little animal, Salemina inquired her to alternate roses
and oleanders with poppies in her hair, and provided her a coral comb and ear-rings on her
birthday. Thus does a moderately hot weather destabilise the firm virtue engendered by Boston
east winds. Francesco--Cecco for short--is general aide in the kitchen, and a good gondolier to boot.
When our little family is expanded by more than three visitors at evening serving of food, Cecco
is pushed into dining- room service, and becomes under-butler to Peppina. Here he is not at ease.
He scrubs his tanned face until it polishes like San Domingo mahogany, paint brushes his very dark
hair until the gloss resembles a varnish, and dons coarse white cotton fabric hand-coverings
to hide his work- stained hands and give an air of latest tendency
and elegance to the banquet.

His humilitation is matching only by his earnestness and devotion to the feared task. Our American
visitors manage not care what we have upon our account of fare when they can rob a glimpse
at the intensely spectacular and impassioned Cecco taking Pina into a corner of the dining-room
and, grabbing her hand, despairingly strive to find out his next duty. Then, with unbelievably
rigid back, he expands his right hand to the visitor, as if the proffered plate held a scorpion
rather than of a tidbit. There is an additional butler to be got when the function is a adequately
impressive one to warrant the total cost, but as he wears carpet slippers and Pina flirts with
him from broth to crop, we find us no better assisted on the entire, and favour Cecco, since
he changes an commonplace serving of food into a beguiling comedy.
"What does it issue, after all?" inquires Salemina. "It is not life we are dwelling, for the instant,
but an proceed of lightweight opera, with the scenes all attractively
decorated, the melodies charming and melodious, the costumes gay and
picturesque.

We are occupying exceptionally good chairs, and we have no blame whatever: we left it in Boston,
where it is likely revolving itself bigger and bigger, like a snowball; but who cares?"
"Who cares, indeed?" I echo. We are here not to pattern our individual characteristics or to advance
our minds, but to let them relax; and when we glimpse any thing which
opposses the Byronic perfect of Venice (the use of the concertina
as the nationwide equipment having this tendency), we on reason close
our eyes to it.

I have a correct consider for reality in affairs of detail like statistics.

I desire to understand the accurate community of a village, the accurate total of young children
of school age, the number of acres in the Yellowstone Park, and the allowance of wheat exported
in 1862; but when it arrives to things moving my fantasy I resent the intrusion of some laboriously
excavated reality, after my issue of outlook is all in a nice way resolved, and my saints, champions,
and martyrs are all snugly and picturesquely organised in their respective niches or on their
correct pedestals.
When the Man of Fact demolishes some attractive fallacy like William Tell and the apple crop,
he should be needed to alternate certain thing identically charming and more authentic. But
he not ever does. He is a helpful but uninteresting animal, the Man of Fact, and for a journeying
companion or a close by at evening serving of food give me the Man of Fancy, even if he has not
a kernel of accurate information hid about his person. It appears to me highly significant that
the bases of Glasgow, Birmingham, Manchester, or Spokane Falls should be fixed in certainty;
but Verona, Padua, and Venice--well, in my attitude, they should be fixed in Byron and Ruskin and Shakespeare.

III
CASA ROSA, May 18.
Such a fanfare of chimes as greeted our ears on the forenoon of our
first awakening in Casa Rosa!

"Rise at one time and dress rapidly, Salemina!" I said. "Either an heir has been born to the throne,
or a foreign Crown Prince has arrive to visit Venice, or possibly
a Papal Bull is loose in the Piazza San Marco.

Whatever it is, we should not overlook it, as I am holding a diary."

That fatigue, primarily an organic state, gives rise to fatigue sensations and to a neural
adjustment for rest--a disinclination to work any longer--and that drowsiness is a somewhat
different organic state that gives an inclination to sleep--all this has been sufficiently
set forth in earlier chapters. During his residence in the United States promulgated the idea
that an American school of music was to be created by developing the themes and rhythms of the
melodies black, and he wrote a symphony, "From the New World," to illustrate its meaning. The
second or slow movement of this work achieved a success almost everywhere distinguished, but
the themes of the first and last movement are not sufficient for the treatment they receive.
This work has been more successful in Europe than in this country.

Perhaps the most notable quality of the personality of Dr. Dvorak is its simplicity, which shows
well in his music. He is rather like a modern Haydn, he has learned and remembered everything
musical coloration has been discovered, but he applied his knowledge in a simple and direct
way without straining after effect.

IV. MUSIC IN SCANDINAVIA.

The most important of Scandinavian composers Edvard Grieg is Hagerup (1843 -), born in Bergen,
Norway, and received his early musical education from his mother, who was an excellent pianist,
and musical. On the advice of the violinist Ole Bull, Grieg was sent in 1858 to Leipzig for
further instructions, where he became a pupil of Moscheles, Hauptmann, Reinecke, Richter and Wenzel.
In 1863 he continued his studies under Gade in Copenhagen. In the company of a talented young
composer, Ricard Nordraak, Grieg was decided, as he says, "against
the fading of Gade and Mendelssohn Scandinavianism intermingled, and
undertook to put in tones of real beauty, strength and inner spirit
of people of northern life.

"He wrote in many varieties of work, and in 1879 reached German recognition playing his own
piano concerto at the Gewandhaus in Leipzig. Grieg's works are full of poetry, easy and natural
expression, and are color impregnated north, so he decided that in some cases, closer to what is
called in the dialect spoken. However, it is clear that his music has enriched the world clearly aware
of the poetry of tone, and introduced a new tone and voice.

He has distinguished himself in almost all departments, in songs,
choral works, chamber music, symphonies, sonatas for piano and violin
and piano, and orchestral suites, of which perhaps two "Peer Gynt"
are the most celebrated .

Grieg himself is slight, blond-haired, with beautiful deep blue eyes and a lovely way. It is
subject to weak lungs, and is forced to live most of their time in warmer climates than those
of their homeland.
Niels W. Gade]
A composer of more than Grieg's Niels Wilhelm Gade (1817-1890), Copenhagen, after a thorough
musical education received in his hometown, attracted greater attention in 1841 to take the prize
for its opening concert "Sounds of Ossian Night, "the judges are Father. Schneider and Spohr, the
violinist. This gave a real Stipendium Gade, with whom he immediately went to study in Leipzig,
where he came under the personal influence of Mendelssohn, an influence
that never exceeded.

On the death of Mendelssohn was appointed conductor of the Gewandhaus, but does not check in every
way satisfactory served only part of a season. Following Glaser's death in 1861, Gade was appointed
director of real music in Copenhagen, a position he held for many years. He was active as a composer
in all directions, his published works covering eight symphonies, overtures, five, two concertos
for violin and orchestra, three sonatas for violin, several cantatas for mixed voices, solidarity
and orchestra, and many other works.

The final sentence of Gade as a tone poet is probably that, while clearly talented, never reached
the imagination of the first order.
Among the younger composers Christian Sinding (1856 -) is to be mentioned. In addition to numerous
chamber works, written a symphony, although not very original that contains the promise of better productions
later.
V. music in England.
The relationship of England to the highest art of music has been peculiar.
 

"The master had a town mansion what's pictured in a log books.It was
called 'Montebella.' The big columns still distance at The end of
Shields Lane.It burnt'about thirty years ago (1937).

"It's part Injured.I paint got no Nigger nose as' my hair is so long I has to keep it wropped[FN:
wrapped]. It's often heard my mummy was redish-looking' with long, straight, black hair. Her
paa was a full blooded Choctaw an' mighty nigh as young as she was.I'se been tol'dat nobody
dast[FN: dared] meddle with her.
 The significance in
which such ladies and such societies were seized, not just in France however in every part of
Europe, can be judged of from the truth, that the break among Deffant and her immature friend
was treated in some gauge as a civic European occurrence. The French minister and overseas
ambassadors took part in it, and the entire literary world feels its outcome. Following this
breach there were two tone-giving tribunals for the direction of communal view in matters of
writing and flavor, and their decisions were spread by memo over all Europe. Horace Walpole, HÃ©nault,
Montesquieu.

Voltaire, whose communication with Deffant has been in print in the current century, remained
correct to her reason. D'Alembert, whose correspondences with Deffant, as well as that of the
Duchess of Maine, have too available in our century, go over to L'Espinasse. This academician,
whose name and power was subsequently in significance to that of Voltaire, created the center of a fresh
civilization in the home of L'Espinasse, and was fatally besieged by his inamorata, who pursued
one sketch of invasion after another when she saw one plan of wedding following another fail
of victory. It appears since the entire of the dealings and consequences linked with this breach,
though amazing it might be, so as to this arrangement of a new loop in Paris for evening amusement
might be by means of reality compared to the organization of a fresh academy for the encouragement
of European society and modification. The Duchess of Luxembourg, who sustained to be a solid
companion of Deffant, took ahead herself to offer appropriate apartments for the people, whilst
the minister of the day (the Duc de Choiseul) prevailed upon the ruler to award an annuity of
no inconsiderable quantity to L'Espinasse.
This new circle was the spot of combination for all the theoretical
reformers.

Here D'Alembert and Diderot lead the discussion; and the well-known
chief of the political economists, TÃ¼rgot, who was later minister
of state, was an affiliate of this bolder circle of men who became
famous and ill-renowned beneath the name of EncyclopÃ¦dists.

 And it is true, because they were not built
properly. When properly constructed, preserved most equal temperatures at all seasons. They are
warm in winter and cool in summer, and sudden changes that affect the weather, without having barely
felt Invalid delicate walls of stone mansion, when adequate attention is given to matter of
ventilation.

But to return to the topic of adaptation. Illustrations that appear to serve to give us a pretty
clear idea of what we mean by initial conditions required to be observed in construction.

The long-term adaptation, we mean that choice of style, materials, size and arrangement as matching
structure: first, to the site, 2D and 3D climate, the uses for which
it is built.

And, first, in terms of site: It is obviously incongruous to lift the house on these two different
sites with different characteristic features and their surroundings, for example, an aircraft
almost a level slightly increasing, probably as you approach from the road heading home must
stand out, and pitched forward again by another large green fields and fertile pastures beyond
- with no background of hills or mountains, does not irregular formed lake, but with a placid
stream, lazy, half-sleeping, half-slip elm crying, and between dispersed groups of stately trees,
old - the other, a romantic hillside in native forest, with its range neighboring mountain, where
the bright summer, noisy, laughing brook kept for your thoughts and
fantasies while walking the hills and the bleak winter wind sighing
through the pines or mourning their total calls Clarion storm spirit. 

When a thermo-couple wouldn't be practical, an optical pyrometer will frequently be used. That
will happen when conditions might be too hot for the couple or a regular sized couple wouldn't
be long enough to measure the temperature.

Nic. Hill. Nuncius Sydereus.]
[Sidenote 2: De phÃ¦nom. lunÃ¦. c. 4.]
The truth is that although they are certainly in earnest, the things they do matter little.
This is clear to any unprejudiced reader. If this were not the case,
Campanella (who knew him as well as Caeser) would never have apologized
for him. (Sidenote: First Flamboyance)
To begin with they are very ill from the self-righteous absurdity as they revel in the public display
of their worship and call to Jehu, Come and see how perfect I am for the Lord of hosts: music
draws your attention to their presence, the magnificent windows publicly show their good deeds,
they keep history written upon the walls for all to see. They see
themselves more holy than Whom they worship as their pride in false
suffering glows more around them than what is really in their spirits. 

A related expediant was also applied to decrease the pressure of their domew, by using the scoriÃ¦
of molten rock imported for that exact reason from the Lipari Islands. The countless bubbles
of this volcano-born material gives it a resmblance to a honeycomb,
and answers the same purpose as the ceramics in Caracalla's Circus,
to the point that, even though it is very solid, it has less mass
than a plank of wood, and thus floats on water.

Before I resign my position in the Circus of Caracalla, I have to mention that the substance
is so like the material used to make our pots, that, are they the exact same material? For a
plank of wood is exactly a plank of wood in every aspect. We made our departure, at which
point an invitation was extended to us to come back the next day to dine. We carefully contemplated
the invitation, then we accepted. With the following day came the volante, accompanying Roque,
most glowing of all remaining caleseros, firmly anchored in his boots and saddle.
 

I'm sure you'll excuse me, then, for offering a different answer to this puzzle, one that's
almost too perfect to ignore. Most of the solutions in these discussions are based, essentially, on
clever guesses. Better answers, though, need evidence that supports them, specifically the kind
of evidence that comes from an education about the past. This kind of educated answer does tend
to bring new problems with it, but it is still better to have the support of facts and documents.
And we can confirm that we have that support when it comes to this
alternative theory.

You may remember Dick Verstegan best for his study of Anglo-Saxon traditions and his reputation in
the field of archeology. He explained that, for example, the name Bacon, which today is associated
with a meat eaten for breakfast, comes from the earlier name Bucon, meaning Beech, as in the
tree -- but the two words remain associated because of the ancient
practice of feeding pigs beech led to them becoming fat and thus perfect
for generating bacon.

What we like about this story is that it explains the relationship between something with an
essentially negative connotation, an unkosher food, and something with an essentially positive
connotation, the hallowed name of a much respected clan. It's all the more important because
of support in the almanac of peerage, Collins' Baronetage, which offers a lengthy documentation
of the first lord to have Bacon as a last name, a William Bacon in the time of Richard the
first. He was the son of the son of the son of the son of the more famous Grimbaldus, a vassel
of William the Conqueror's who made his home in Norfolk.

Of course, the first Bacon must have had some motive that led him to take the name. Collins
doesn't specifically say so (DV did get it, though), but it was because of his new family crest,
which displays a silver beech tree. We have to be grateful to these two excellent scholars
for making this connection, independent of each other. With their work, we can document with
certainty that Bacon means Beech rather than pork, and that this historic name is of the same
kind as others associated with trees, like Ash, both in English and in Latin (where the name
is De Fago or something similar).

Indeed, the motto of the Somersetshire branch of the Bacon family has to do with trees, if we
read it a certain way, i.e. by transliteration rather than translation: "hearts of oak." After
Grimbaldus, this family hasn't featured the soldiers than experts in geneology like to brag about,
and, of course, their men haven't literally had wooden hearts. But this select group includes
the illustrious names of many literary, scientific, and artistic geniuses. The motto is appropriate,
even modest, and doesn't need more explanation or to call more attention to itself.

Thanks for the opportunity to bring this, my humble opinion, to your attention, and sincerely
yours,

~PC

Postscriptum: The Norfolk branch of the Bacon family has a very detailed
and specific history, one of the better examples available.

If you're interested in family records and history and want more information, refer to the Herald's
College records for more details.

N., the same one who wrote to you about the Somerset Bacons, does note that Bacon used to mean
dessicated wood. Unfortunately, I can't find that reference. It's clear that the early Saxon word
meant beech or beech-like or having to do with that specific tree.

So it's likely that, at some point, Bacon meant wood that had been dried, but that would be
more interesting if we knew who says that's so, when, and how he was qualified to make that determination.
Can you get NOCAB to send us the citation? Or can you or any of the people you're in touch
with via your writing tell us where that particular fact is written?
Clearing this up with further investigation is a good use of time
and energy. What bacon means, both the name and the noun, and where
it comes from is something a lot of people have been interesting in
for three centuries, including experts in word origins and lovers
of words. But, despite the time frame, we still don't have a perfect
answer. We know that it's an old family with a lot of accomplishments,
as I mentioned earlier, in arts, sciences, and, yes, literature, with
a very well documented lineage, so we should be able to figure this
out. Of course, even Lord Bacon, the man who knew all there was to
know in his time, wasn't sure, is known to have said he did not know
the origin of his own surname.

Definition of the
term Bacon, Volume 2 The extraordinary conduct and the conversation
with the little Simon Deg made the shoemaker to astonish.

Simon Deg expressed his utmost uneasiness at their treading on the flowers in the grass. He
told, he would burst with tears if they persisted in it. When asked
why, he said they were so beautiful,that they must enjoy the sunshine,
and be very unhappy to die. The shoemaker was amazed, but indulged
the lad's fancy. Large numbers of uneducated natives
in our country need to be reached out to and saved, because they cannot be saved alone. Everyone
is owed Christianity by those, such as us, who already have it. We must give them the chance to
accept intelligent faith. Nearly half of the eight million people in our country are ignorant
and weak in their thoughts and morals, but they can be saved. What we have already done is a promise
of what is yet to be done; let us dedicate ourselves again to winning peace. Free and large offerings
must be made for the glory of Christian love and faith, Christian thinking and working, and for
the unsaved who await the day of God's redemption, which is a glory that does not come of sieges
and battles.
Will you take Cuba for Christ? Some people may regard that one of the vices of food reformers
is exaggeration. However, one can safely say that Mr Eustace Miles and the restaurant associated with
his name have played an important role in bringing about the more
sympathetic attitude towards "food reform" noticeable on all sides.

Mr Miles admits that he has expertise in the area of advertising.

The advertisement have been important in influencing people to accepting food reform, people
who are repelled by the out-and-out "vegetarian" propaganda.
There are a lot of people who dislike the introduction of manufactured or artificial food into
the health movement.
 Meanwhile, Clo had responded the
bang and disclosed Johnson.
"Madam, the woman who came with Mr. Sands desires to glimpse you immediately; it's very urgent,"
he announced.
"Say I'll be there in a couple of minutes," she replied. "I can't arrive just yet."
Johnson departed.

"Madam will arrive in a couple of minutes," he recurring to Miss Blackburne, who had been apprehensively
awaiting him at a half-open door.

"I think," he supplemented, "she is engaged, miss."

"In that case," proposed the pearl-stringer, "perhaps you'd better call Mr. Sands."
"Very well, overlook, I'll manage so." Johnson turned away, and Miss Blackburne withdrew to the
boudoir.
But it appeared to Clo that Roger might be summoned if Beverley delayed.
"Something should be being concerned Miss Blackburne," she said.

"I marvel if it's any thing you'd like Mr. Sands to blend up in,
or if you'd rather join to it yourself- You understand, we've allotments
of time before 10 o'clock.

If the papers are in this wrapper, it's all right. If not, there's not anything doing."  
Just
why Beverley did not desire Roger to proceed to her boudoir she barely knew, except she dreaded
that a pearl might be missing, and that Roger would be more vexed than he was already. Whatever the
motive in her brain, she sensed abruptly impelled to haste. Even with Clo she could not depart
the envelope. Wrapping it in the handkerchief to conceal the address, she rushed off with it
in her hand.
"You dispatched for me, Miss Blackburne-" she inquired, as she chucked open the door.
The pearl-stringer stood by the table, looking fair and strange.
"Oh, Mrs. Sands," she called out, "you notified me the pearls were in their case, but they're
not. I discovered it empty.

You should have prepared them somewhere else."
Beverley marvelled if she had become for the time being insane, and had concealed the pearls in
a location currently forgotten. But in her heart she knew that not anything of the sort had
happened.
"No," she said, responding herself as well as Miss Blackburne, "I
didn't feel the pearls after I put them away, and conveyed them in
here.

Oh, delight don't tease me! This is too serious!"
"Tease you!" echoed Miss Blackburne. "Why, Mrs. Sands, I wouldn't manage such a thing! I desire
to goodness I'd asserted on your residing till I'd opened the case and counted the pearls.
I don't believe I was ever so foolish before! Now, perhaps you'll accept as factual that I've sto----"

"No--no!" called out Beverley, calmed by the other's distress.

"Of course I accept as factual not anything so foolish. Even if you--what absurdity to talk
of it!--but even if you liked the pearls, you couldn't conceal them. Let me think! Let me
proceed back in my brain over everything that happened. I was in the next room virtually all the
time when I wasn't here.

The doorway was open between.

I could have glimpsed any one who came in. Oh, the pearls can't have been stolen. There's been
no one to rob them."
"What about our little ally, Clo Riley-" Miss Blackburne asked. "Could she probably understand
anything- Mightn't she assist with some suggestion- I considered hers one of the brightest, quickest
minds I ever met. Indeed, I owe my life to its quickness."

Beverley forgot to answer. The pearl-stringer's phrases had dispatched her ideas journeying along
a new path. Suddenly she became cognizant that she had deceived Miss Blackburne and herself.
When she made that declaration, she had not reflected.

Clo's come back, in O'Reilly's business, now appeared so long before that she had not cast
her brain back so far in attachment with the pearls. She had considered of what she had finished
since O'Reilly's denial of her demand, and his departure. She had pictured herself as having glimpsed
the pearls in their case since then. But she had not finished so. She had glimpsed only the
shut case, and had routinely taken it for conceded that the pearls
were in it.

As a issue of detail, she had not really glimpsed them since she herself shut the velvet case. Could
Clo probably have dashed into the boudoir and concealed the pearls-
"I'll talk to Clo," she eventually answered, with a dazed gaze after a quiet that mystified
Miss Blackburne.
"Please stay here. I'll be back in three or four minutes, and convey
Clo with me, if she's well enough."  
Clo, denuded of the thieved
cloak, had flung herself upon the bed to rest, and call back the force
of her vitality for a subsequent effort. Her nerves were throbbing
like warm wires, and she leapt at the unfastening of the door.  
"Oh,
I'm pleased it's you!" she sighed, at view of Beverley. "Have you
opened the envelope-"  
"The envelope!" Beverley repeated. "Oh,
Clo, I considered not anything on soil could have put it out of my
head for a second. He pushed for the
assembly of a chapel as soon as possible. The chapel should be of capacity appropriate for the demands
of the college.

There were other objects calling for a far greater sum of money than the college could afforded,
but he considered this of great importance. He succeeded in getting money for the chapel first.
He accelerated the selection of the site and the drawing of the plans. The finishing point
of the work was much impeded because of the lack of funds, but his
interest in its composition never wilted. Menorah movement is welcome as evidence
of a new order in the life of the young college Jew. He came to see finally that is funny,
in large part to stay out of the Greek letter fraternities of the Greeks and barbarians, it is
tragic, in large part, to shut out life their own people. This is from his own people that should
take your vision and support spiritually, if you want to live a life of self-control rather
than the life of a despicable parasite roots chameleonizing anywhere and everywhere. There was
a time when his fellow Jews excuse half the men of the university, who left the life of Israel,
as if the burden of the security Jews were too much for the shoulders
and unproven unrobust of our Jewish college men as if their intellectual
and moral squeamishness led the rebellion against the inevitable association
with his fellow Jews so despised and misunderstood completely.

Now we see, and our younger brothers of the scholarship Menorah have
caught the vision that no Jew can be truly educated Jewishly is uprooted,
the man who rejected the birthright of inheritance of the traditions
of the first and virilest of civilized nations of earth leads to the
impoverishment of their own being.

The Jew is a Jew "small" is less a man.
The Menorah lights the way for the fellowship of the youth of Israel, or self-reverence. Long
light obscured revived!
 My marriage had been previously arranged to take place just fourteen
days after this date. And although during subsequent years our faith was often exercised,
and sometimes severely, He ever proved faithful to His promise, and never suffered us to lack
any good thing.  Never, perhaps, was there a union that more fully realized the blessed truth,
"Whoso findeth a wife findeth a good thing, and obtaineth favour of the LORD." My dear wife was
not only a precious gift to me; GOD blessed her to many others during the twelve eventful years
through which she was spared to those that loved her and to China.  Hers had been a life connection
with missionary work in that great empire; for her father, the loved and devoted Samuel Dyer,
was amongst the very earliest legislature of the London Mission in the East. He reached the
Straits as early as 1827, and for sixteen years laboured assiduously amongst the Chinese in Penang
and Singapore, completing at the same time a valuable fount of Chinese metallic type, the first
of the kind that had then been attempted. Dying in 1843, it was never Mr. Dyers a prerogative
to realise his hopes of ultimately being able to settle on Chinese soil; but his children lived
to see the country opened to the Gospel, and to take their share in the great work that had been
so dear to his heart. At the time of her marriage, my dear wife had been already living for
several years in Ningpo with her friend, Miss Aldersey, in whose varied missionary operations
she was well qualified to render valuable assistance.  CHAPTER XVII  GOD A REFUGE FOR US
A SOMEWHAT different though not less manifest answer to prayer was
vouchsafed early in the year 1859.

My dear wife was brought very low by illness, and at last all hope
of recovery seemed gone.

Every remedy tried had proved unavailing; and Dr. Parker, who was in attendance, had nothing
more to suggest. Life was ebbing fast away. The only ground of hope was that GOD might yet
see fit to raise her up, in answer to believing but yielding prayer.  The afternoon for the
usual prayer meeting among the missionaries had arrived, and I sent in a request for prayer,
which was most warmly responded to. Just at this time a remedy that had not yet been tried
was suggested to my mind, and I felt that I must hasten to consult Dr. Parker as to the propriety
of using it. It was a moment of anguish. The hollow temples, sunken eyes, and pinched features
denoted the near approach of death; and it seemed more than questionable as to whether life
would hold out until my return. It was nearly two miles to Dr. Parker's house, and every moment
appeared long. On my way thither, while wrestling powerfully with GOD in prayer, the precious
words were brought with power to my soul, "Call upon Me in the day of trouble: I will deliver
thee, and thou shall glorify Me." I was at once enabled to plead them in faith, and the result
was deep, deep, unspeakable peace and joy. All sensations of distance was gone. Dr. Parker cordially
approved of the use of the means suggested, but upon arriving at
home I saw at a glance that the desired change had taken place in
the absence of this or any other remedy.

The pinched aspect of the countenance had given place to the calmness of tranquil slumber, and
not one unfavourable symptom remained to retard recovery to health
and strength.

Spared thus in answer to prayer the loss of my own loved one, it was with added sympathy and sorrow
that I felt for Dr. Parker, when, in the latter portion of the same year, his own wife was very
suddenly removed
 The main part of the disagreement looks like Miss Taylor's
idol, Janet, and her comrades (who are their own people) are generally tossed a lot more at them
selves than is the situation with their luckier siblings. None
shall blame us for being Apostles of Culture. ***  It is reported that the Australian and
New Zealand soldiers at present in London have a strong liking to visit the British Museum, and
are in particular interested in the Egyptian antiques.

But it is false that they refer England as âThe Mummy Country.â ***  The dispute between Austrians
and Hungarians on the possessed Serbian territory as to whom it belongs to, either to the Monarchy
or the Kingdom, and the jurists of either side are trying to examine thoroughly the history
of previous disputes to be added to their particular case. Here we have an illustrating point of affection
of educated men on arguments on specific questions concerned with education. Serbia would be
only for Serbians.

***  An man of American birth proceeded to see his spouse while she was with her mother but
could not find her even after three daysâ search, hence tries to free from accusation stating
that he forgot her maiden name. He immediately connects it to absence of mind; and his mother-in-law
is of the tendency to support his view.

***  Soap is the recent product introduced to be put on the list of absolute contraband; and it

is sufficient. Thanks
to the assistance of his wife, he was able to start a night school. More schools were required.
The Columbia Board of Education took interest and provided teachers
and the mill company provided for the equipment. In a country where there are not enough natural
resources, people are always desperate for more supplies. We had been waiting for a while for
more supplies and would often turn towards the ocean, hoping to see a ship approaching with
supplies from England. However, none ever came. Desperate, the 'Sirius' was sent on on October
2nd on a mission to purchase supplies from the Cape of Good Hope to furnish our fort.

Governor Rose Hill's new settlement was established 15 miles inland on November 3rd. They figured
that the soil here would be more suitable for growing than that around Sydney. A small temporary
fort was put together and some guards posted around it to protect
the convicts who did farming labor there.

On November 19th, the remaining two transports departed for England, en route via Cape horn.
We now had very little supplies left. We were entirely isolated from the rest of the civilized
world and this inflicted a sense of deep desolation. There was a convict named Daly who was
hung for his crime of burglary. He was a well known thief and fraud who had previously told everyone
that he had found a gold mine.

It was a combination of earth mixed with metal which he pretended was a finding of gold. However,
his story went on and on and was quite far fetched and difficult to believe. A group was sent
out under his guidance to explore it, but ultimately he confessed
that he had actually crushed an oil pair of buckles and mixed this
in with the sand and stone as opposed to actually finding a real gold
mine. 

FOOTNOTES:

[1] because of the obtention of this short document, another line has been made, this extending
from Elgin to Lossie-mouth. it is mentioned to have appreciated traffics far beyond the expectations
of the shareholders in the first few weeks. Wed? What, she has been married all this time for someone who has eaten and did not let?
Oh, I say, what a game! "And she threw her head back and laughed till the garden rang again.

"Oh shut up, you naughty little girl!" I asked, catching her by the arm, and terrified beyond measure
by the loudness of her laughter.

"Do not make that horrid noise - we are sure you will be caught if you do not stop ----"
The little girl stopped a shout of laughter in the middle and close her mouth with a snap. Her eyes,
round and black and shiny like boot buttons, came more from her head.

"Caught?" she said impatiently.

"What, are you afraid of being caught too? Well, it's a game!" And with her hands plunged deep into the
pockets of her coat she capered before me in excess of her pleasure,
reminding me of a very fat black lamb frisking round without end and
passive sheep its mother.

It was clear that the time had come for me to take down the gate at
the bottom of the garden as soon as possible, and I started off in
this direction.

Little girl at once stopped capering and placed himself in front of me completely. "Who are you?"
she said, considering most of my hat to my boots with keenest interest.

Considered this way ungarnished of impertinent questions, and trying to see very high, made
an effort to move to the side.
Little girl, with a quick movement, cork-like, was there before me.
"Who are you?" she repeated, her expression friendly, but firm. "Oh, I - I'm a pilgrim," I said
in despair.
"A traveler!" echoed the little girl. She seemed struck, and while she was hitting slipped past her
and began to walk quickly towards the door in the wall. "A traveler!" said the little girl,
again, keeping close beside me, and looking up and down carefully. "I do not like pilgrims. Are
not they the people who are always walking around, and there are things the matter with their
feet? Do you have anything the matter with your feet?"

"Certainly not," I answered angrily, still moving faster. "And they never wash, Miss Robinson
said. You do not, do you?"
"Not wash? Oh, I'm afraid you're a very bad brought-up little girl - oh, let alone - I have to run
-"
"So have I," said the little girl, with joy, "for Miss Robinson must be close behind us. She
nearly had me just before I found you." And she started running from my side.
The thought of Miss Robinson close behind us gave wings to my feet, and, casting my dignity,
of which, indeed, but there was little left for the winds, I flew down the road enough. Little
girl was not to convince, and why she panted and turned weird colors, held by my side and even
talked. Oh, I was tired, tired in body and mind, tired from the various
blows I had received, tired of traveling, tired from want of food,
and here I was being forced to run because very bad that this little
girl chose to hide instead of going in for her lessons. 
"I say
- this is funny -" she jerked out. Translations
must recreate these features, whatever its failure is. Passing current translations in review, he
finds Cowper to be slow, Pope, rather artificial, Chapman fancy, Newman through his theory's
vice, ignoble.

Some one having pronounced Tennyson eminently Homeric, Mr. Arnold addresses the relation of
teh English idyllic with the Ionian poet, and sees that he is at the opposite as regards to
the simplicity.
On the vehicle for Homer's translation, he votes in favor of English hexameter, and tries the
measure himself. His success is found to be respectable, but not
eminent. He is very slow in movement of thought, and too opposed in
his character. Thinking that the choir, north along with south transepts, become enclosed, to the eastern
portion of the church, intended for divine service; thinking that the pews, situated in the nave,
become removed into this sort of part, for the accommodation from the inhabitants. "
Inside 1838 the nave, having been completely operated on from the climate and alternative destructive
forces, ended up being taken down; and from the following year the
foundation stone of the mean and flimsy replace, in the "Gothic" from
the period, was installed by Dr. Sumner, after that Bishop of Winchester.

The interior, thus restrained and reduced, ended up being fitted up along with timber staircases,
wainscoting, galleries, high pews, and the "three-decker" pulpit, which answered the double purpose
of obscuring the planet and enabling the preacher to command line his audience from the galleries.

The barbarous result failed to escape the receptive eye of Mr. A. W. Pugin, the greater Gothic
revivalist, who gave in-take to his indignation in a scathing article from the "Dublin Review.
" They said:
"It probably are not amiss to sketch public attention to the atrocities that include lately been
perpetrated from the venerable church connected with St. Saviour's, Southwark. But a couple
of years since it was just about the most perfect second-class cruciform churches in England,
and an edifice rich in the most interesting associations of the ancient history from the Metropolis.
The top was first removed off its substantial and solemn nave; in
such a state it was left a substantial time, exposed to all the injuries
connected with wet and weather conditions; at length it was before
condemned to become pulled down, and in preference to one of the best
possible specimens of ecclesiastical buildings left in London--with
substantial walls and support beams, deeply moulded arches, a best
south porch, plus a splendid western doorway--we include as vile the
preaching-place... as ever previously disgraced the nineteenth century.

"It is bad enough to view such an erection shoot up at all, but when a venerable building is
demolished to make way for that, the case is intolerable. Will that be believed that will,
under the heart tower, in the transepts of the once most beauteous religious organization,
staircases on stilts were set up, exactly resembling those where the company ascend to your
booth or race-course?... Outright the preaching-house system perhaps have brought such utter
desolation on the stately church; the truth is, the abomination will be so great so it must
be seen to become credited. "
Bizarre
as it may perhaps appear, the seating lodging under this set up was even above it is at this
time, and the congregations on the Sunday services ended up almost as large because they are to-day.
It could be quite wrong, as a result, to suppose that will no religious work was taking place
, in the parish.
 We don't hesitate to say that royal dignity, even with
the backing of England and France, isn't worth ten years of hard work to get the job done.

Every vacationer to Greece complains about the coffee houses where the unemployed bums sit around
all day long taking up space. What else can you expect from a country where the farm workers
take three months off a year, leaving the farm owner stranded, without
a way to make his land profitable.

In this case, the need for workers becomes a hit and miss proposition. The working class become pickpockets
and robbers just to get by, and the educated and higher social classes
become government workers, plundering the wealth of the nation. In 1827, when Joshua Wyeth was sixteen years old and employed as
a journeyman blacksmith by Watson and Gridley, he told the Rev. Timothy Flint the details of
the affair. He said:
"There were between twenty-eight and thirty of us. This definitely shows that the view that the regulation of the brute sexual appetite
was initiated by women. So it shows that their actions are exemplary of womoankind from the earliest
days of savagery to the civilzation of modern day.
In addition, further evidence of the acceptance of this view is the way by which new husbands came
into the group.

They were brought by the women, in direct oppostion to the will and knowledge of thier patriarch.
Among the primitive tribes there is a custom that allows the suitors to visit thier brides in
secret. I refer to secret sexual meetings between man and wife hidden by the night. This is one
of the earliest forms of marriage and is closely connected to the maternal system of the family.
There appears to be no cause for this precaution. I do not belive that it can be explained by the
supersitions the sexes have of each other, which is manifested in this form of sexual taboo.
Although it is a factor in the continuation of the custom, it does not seem to be the true explination
of its origin. These hidden meetings had to have happened if the daughters of the group defied the
partriarch, like I believe they did. Is the custom as it exists be a survival, reenforced by supersitions,
from a time when these visits were necessary for safty?[38]
[38] Mr. Atkinson mentions these types of marriages, but does not
connect the custom with the actions of any of the young women.

Mr. Atkinson's view differs from my own. He gives no power to the women. He belives that the
women would be left with out husbands after the passing of the patriarch. Thier suitors would
be brought in by thier brothers. We are supposed to believe they did so to ease the burden
on themselves of their widowed sisters and prevent them from being
captured and carried off by other groups.

According to Mr. Atkinson, these outside lovers would not endanger the family's peace. They
would come from the neighboring groups that the brothers had captured their wives from and
thus remove challange to the marital rights of the new comers. I disagree that the brothers
had to feed and maintain their sisters, such an opinion is just another example of the underapprciation
of the women's side of the equation. I admit that the sisters may have had assistance from their
borthers; though I believe that that this was not necessary.

Just to be on his way was a relief knowing every minute was one minute
closer to finding what was lost.

 

The situations of the new and former curÃ©s always bring them into conflict, even when they
are accommodating.

To the new curÃ©s, the old curÃ©s are "intruders", to the old curÃ©s the new curÃ©s are "refactories".
As their role is to keep watch over souls, new curÃ©s can't dispense with telling their flock
that the intruder has been cast out of the Church, that his sacraments
don't have any value or or sacrilegious, or that attending their mass
would be sinful.

As he is a public functionary, the latter never ceases to inform the powers that be that the "refactory"
draws the faithful into a trap, exciting their minds and weakens
the Constitution - and therefore should be forcibly restrained.

That is to say, the former ostracises the latter, but the latter
puts the police against the former, and thus commences the witch-hunt.

Ironically, the mayority are the ones suffering persecution, while
the minority inflict it.

The constitutional curÃ©'s Mass is barren in all parts.

[2279] In La VendÃ©e out of 600 parishioners only ten or twelve are
present; on Sundays and free days the entirety of villages and market
towns come from one or two leagues away to go to the orthodox mass,
with those from the village stating that they would pay double tax
if only the old curÃ© could come back.

In Alsace, "at least 90% of the Catholics will not recognise legally sworn priests." It's the
same in Franche-ComtÃ©, Artois, and in two other regions of France. At last, as though it were a chemical
composition, the analysis comes to an end. The ones that either believe or believe once more
huddle round the old curÃ©; those who keep faith in the sacraments whether by custom or faith. They
feel the need to attend his mass. Those who do not believe or are deists are the auditors of
the new curÃ©, as well as the indifferent members of the club and
the administration.

They side with the Church just as they would with the Hotel De Ville or a popular meeting, not
for any religious whim but through political desire, and these people, in order to maintain
the COnstitution, put their faith in the so-called "intruder". And yet, this isnt enough to
get this man complete devotees but what it does do is give him loyal defenders and despite
not possessing any faith these people support him as befits their position. Versus an intractable
bishop or curÃ©, anything goes, whether it is the bastardisation of the law brought about by their
dodgy interpretation and their arbitrary verdicts, or the riots caused
by their own volition, sanctioned by lack of tolerance.

[2280] The curÃ© is forced out of his parish, made to go to a town in the country, and put away
from sight. The Aisne Directory demonises him as a breacher of the peace, strictly forbidding him
from giving sacraments. The council of Cahors closes certain churches and makes those churchmen
who do not jure to exit the town within 24 hours.

They are denounced by Lot's electoral corps as "ferocious brutes", trouble causers and war-provokers.
According to the Directory of the Bas-Rhin they should be expelled to Strasbourg or to fifteen leagues
from the border. At Saint-Leon they make the bishop flee.
 The main working muscle of the system is the brain.
We purify and re-purify the understanding powers to a diamond point and brightness, as if they
were the only ruling faculties,and we had no physical or spiritual nature binding us. The university
and the hospital differs in that a univeristy creates disease and a hospital cures.
 

Second-Lieutenant J. J. C. de V. Williamson was his military title. Ah, is is sad you don't.
He was quite a kid, but he could curse you as free and expressive as a blooming General, and
never say the same thing for ten minutes.

APOLOGY FOR THE FRENCH REVOLUTION, 1793

Sir,
Man's moral existence is hinged upon his reputation. Addison once
made the allegory that man crosses an enormous bridge from which,
one by one, we begin to disappear permanently, due to a variety of
causes. "Captain Monk has no right to be in my affairs. He should keep his nose out of everyone's
business. Hopefully, my mother will welcome you with love."
Alice's emotions led her into tears. "Please to let it be forever," she asked. "Your words will for surely
turn me away."
"I will let time tell.

I have more reasons than one. Always remember you are my wife Alice."
Mr. Harry Carradyne strong as a soldier should be took a couple of kisses from her lips to make his
point.
IV.

Time passed by without much of notice.

Mr. Hamlyn's West Indian estate had been giving him a lot of trouble and he felt he needed to go over
occasionally to look after it in person. When he was away from his estate he would stay with his
wife in Peacock's Range or London. Their home was at Bryanstone Square, a lovely small house.

Autumn had been cold and damp. The skys were grey and snow fell in Novemember. One dreary day
Mrs. Hamlyn was shaking over her fireplace and demanded more coal.
"Is Master Walter here yet?" she asked of the peasants.
"No! He is playing in the front of the house."
She went to look out the window.

He was running around the garden with his nurse by his side. He was a stout little fellow. His
mother, wishing to make him stronger, sent him out in all kinds of weathes, and the boy loved it.
He was three years old now and looked like he was five. He was as intelligent as some children
are at five or six. Her heart bounced with a strange happiness only every time she saw him.
He was her chief purpose in life, her joy. Whether he would leave to Leet Hall she had no idea. Captain
Monk had not mentioned no more about the subject, for or against the matter.
She has longed for it. She wanted to please deceased uncle, but what
about Harry Carradyne?

It was just as wrong being his father's oldest and only son the boy would inherit a fine estate
and become wealthy, but his mother must give him the Leet Hall as well.
She loved watching her son play. A little bit of snowflakes were beginning to fall, and night
would soon be drawing on, but she would not get him to come in. Standing near the window, it gradually
grew upon her to check out something was standing back against the opposite rails, looking
straight at the houses. A young, fair woman, with a streak of light hair she was draped in a tight
dark cloak which served to conceal her body, just as the veil she wore hid her face.
"I believe it is this house she is looking at so attentively at me,"
thought Mrs. Hamlyn.

"What can she possibly want from me?"

The woman did not move away and Mrs. Hamlyn did not move they remained gazing at one another.
Presently Walter ran into the room, laughing in glee at having scared
his nurse.

His mother turned, caught him in her arms and kissed him greatfully. He was a lovable, generous
child, and very pretty with great big brown eyes and curly hair. His life was all sunshine,
like a butterfly on a flower. His path was of roses without their thorns.
"Mother, I've got a picture book come and look at it," cried the excited voice, as he drug his mother
to the hearthrug and opened the picture-book in the quickiness.

"Penelope got it for me."
She sat down on a chair with the book on her lap and one arm round
him, her joy. Penelope waited to take off his hat and coat, and was
told to come for him in ten minutes. 
"It's not time for tea." cried
he defiantly. 
"Yes, Master Walter, it is long time past it," said
the nurse. "I couldn't get him in before" she told to her mistress.
"Every time I kept expecting you'd be sending one of the servants
to come get us." 
"In ten minutes," said Mrs. Hamlyn. "And what's
this picture about, Walter? Is it a little girl with a lovely doll?" To Prof. S.F. Baird:
Dear Sir, I have gone to the fish market just now to see the fishing crew bring up their catch
from one of their traps. It is a strange phenomenon to observe that many young salmon are caught
this year. Few young salmon are caught daily at Sconticut Neck, the mouth of our river but
recently, many of them have been caught.They range from two pounds to thirty-three pounds
in weight and are of two different ages. Generally half of them weigh two pounds and the other
half weigh about six to eight pounds. Last week, one whopper weighing thirty-three pounds was
caught, while another catch was all of eighteen pounds. The fishermen at the fishery, The Vineyard,
noted that these fish could have been the young of those salmon which are found in some of our
rivers.
From John H. Thomson
To Prof. Spencer F. Baird:
Dear Sir, I have received your letter and followed your instruction to check if any salmon has
been caught in the fish traps. It seems none of them has been caught. From the end of April
to the first two weeks in May, Mr Bassett has thirty to thirty-five fish in the trap at Menimpsha,
and ten to twelve fish from Sconticut Neck, the mouth of our river.

Mr Bartlett had about a dozen fish caught in the traps near Slocum's
rivermouth which is six miles west from here and two fish caught at
the mouth of Westport River.

I cannot ascertain if any of the fish in the traps could have been salmon since few of the fishermen
know anything about this type of fish, especially those fishermen from Sconticut Neck.
From John H. Thomson
****** A ten-pound salmon and seventeen tautog, of more than one
hundred pounds were caught in the weirs of Magnolia on Thursday night.

For over thirty years in Cape Ann, this has been the first salmon to be caught. Three more big salmon
and a hundred and fifty large mackerel were caught on Saturday morning. The fishermen are hopeful
of catching more salmon in the near future. Cape Ann Advertiser,
June 6, 1879 *******  P.S. a 12.5-pound Kennebec salmon is caught
today in the Hudson River at Bath near Albany and sold for forty cents
per pound. -adapted from a letter from Monroe A.Green, New York State
Fishery Commission, to Fred Mather June 9,1879. Many provisions outlined in the
Irish Parliments Bill 1893 are currently being rewritten and resubmitted in the form of Bill
1886 as soon as they can be gleaned from certain Ministers speech notes. As a matter of fact,
the minor differences preclude additional documentation, basing discussions solely on Bill 1893,
recently passed by the House of Commons. The Bill must be favorable in both houses, but if this
does not turn out to be the case, the Legislative Assembly version,
after a two year stall, will be debated in a Joint Session of the
two Houses.
