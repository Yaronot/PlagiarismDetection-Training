crowd, so well dressed and full of animation! Misfortunes here, this evening! why, dear Julia,
you do not think it. It is in darkness and solitude that misfortunes come--never in the midst
of a joyous crowd, and in all this blaze of light."

"Good gracious, Adrienne! take care!" cried the marchioness, unable to repress an exclamation
of alarm, and seizing her arm, as if to draw her closer; "do you not see it?" And with a trembling
