  |    Many people are kept ill because they do not            |
  |    know how to select food that their own particular     |
  |    bodies will take up and build upon.                     |

PREFACE.

The first edition of 1884 contained but 5 pages of type; the second of 1898, 14 pages. Only
by conciseness has it been possible to give even a summary of the principles of dietetics within
the limit or this pamphlet. Should there appear in places an abruptness or incompleteness of
treatment, these limitations must be my excuse.

Those who wish to thoroughly study the science of food are referred to the standard work, "Food
and Dietetics," by Dr. R. Hutchison (E. Arnold, 16s.). The effects of purin bodies in producing
illness has been patiently and thoroughly worked out by Dr. Alexander Haig. Students are referred
to his "Uric Acid, an epitome of the subject" (J. & A. Churchhill, 1904, 2s.6d.), or to his
larger work on "Uric Acid." An able scientific summary of investigations on purins, their chemical
and pathological properties, and the quantities in foods will be found in "The Purin Bodies
of Food Stuffs," by Dr. I. Walker Hall (Sherratt & Hughes, Manchester, 1903, 4s.6d.). The U.S.
Department of Agriculture has made a large number of elaborate researches on food and nutrition.
My thanks are due to Mr. Albert Broadbent, the Secretary of the Vegetarian Society, for placing
some of their bulletins in my hands, and for suggestions and help. He has also written several
useful popular booklets on food of a very practical character, at from a penny to threepence each.

Popular literature abounds in unsound statements on food. It is unfortunate that many ardent
workers in the cause of health are lacking in scientific knowledge, especially of physiology
and chemistry. By their immature and sweeping statements from the platform and press, they
often bring discredit on a good cause. Matters of health must be primarily based on experience
and we must bear in mind that each person can at the most have full knowledge of himself alone,
and to a less degree of his family and intimates. The general rules of health are applicable
to all alike, but not in their details. Owing to individual imperfections of constitution,
difference of temperament and environment, there is danger when one man attempts to measure
others by his own standard.

For the opinions here expressed I only must be held responsible, and not the Society publishing
the pamphlet.

Vegetarians, generally, place the humane as the highest reason for their practice, though the
determining cause of the change from a flesh diet has been in most cases bad health.

A vegetarian may be defined as one who abstains from all animals as food. The term animal is
used in its proper scientific sense (comprising insects, molluscs, crustaceans, fish, etc.).
Animal products are not excluded, though they are not considered really necessary. They are
looked upon as a great convenience, whilst free from nearly all the objections appertaining
to flesh food.

A.W.D.

The Chemistry of Food and Nutrition

By A.W. DUNCAN, F.C.S.

We may define a food to be any substance which will repair the functional waste of the body,
increase its growth, or maintain the heat, muscular, and nervous energy. In its most comprehensive
sense, the oxygen of the air is a food; as although it is admitted by the lungs, it passes
into the blood, and there re-acts upon the other food which has passed through the stomach.
It is usual, however, to restrict the term food to such nutriment as enters the body by the
intestinal canal. Water is often spoken of as being distinct from food, but for this there
is no sufficient reason.

Many popular writers have divided foods into flesh-formers, heat-givers, and bone-formers.
Although attractive from its simplicity, this classification will not bear criticism. Flesh-formers
are also heat-givers. Only a portion of the mineral matter goes to form bone.

Class I.--INORGANIC COMPOUNDS.
  Sub-class 1. Water. 2. Mineral Matter or Salts.
Class II--ORGANIC COMPOUNDS.
  1. Non-Nitrogeneous or Ternary Compounds. a Carbohydrates.
    b Oils. c Organic Acids.
  2. Nitrogenous Compounds. a Proteids. b Osseids.
Class III.--NON-NUTRITIVES, FOOD ADJUNCTS AND DRUGS.
  Essential Oils, Alkaloids, Extractives, Alcohol, &c.

These last are not strictly foods, if we keep to the definition already given; but they are
consumed with the true foods or nutrients, comprised in the other two classes, and cannot well
be excluded from consideration.

Water forms an essential part of all the tissues of the body. It is the solvent and carrier
of other substances.

Mineral Matter or Salts, is left as an ash when food is thoroughly burnt. The most important
salts are calcium phosphate, carbonate and fluoride, sodium chloride, potassium phosphate and
chloride, and compounds of magnesium, iron and silicon.

Mineral matter is quite as necessary for plant as for animal life, and is therefore present
in all food, except in the case of some highly-prepared ones, such as sugar, starch and oil.
Children require a good proportion of calcium phosphate for the growth of their bones, whilst
adults require less. The outer part of the grain of cereals is the richest in mineral constituents,
white flour and rice are deficient. Wheatmeal and oatmeal are especially recommended for the
quantity of phosphates and other salts contained in them. Mineral matter is necessary not only
for the bones but for every tissue of the body.

When haricots are cooked, the liquid is often thrown away, and the beans served nearly dry,
or with parsley or other sauce. Not only is the food less tasty but important saline constituents
are lost. The author has made the following experiments:--German whole lentils, Egyptian split
red lentils and medium haricot beans were soaked all night (16 hours) in just sufficient cold
water to keep them covered. The water was poured off and evaporated, the residue heated in
the steam-oven to perfect dryness and weighed. After pouring off the water, the haricots were
boiled in more water until thoroughly cooked, the liquid being kept as low as possible. The
liquid was poured off as clear as possible, from the haricots, evaporated and dried. The ash
was taken in each case, and the alkalinity of the water-soluble ash was calculated as potash
(K{2}O). The quantity of water which could be poured off was with the German lentils, half
as much more than the original weight of the pulse; not quite as much could be poured off the
others.

                       G. Lentils.  E. Lentils.  Haricots.  Cooked H.
Proportion of liquid   1.5          1.25         1.20       --
Soluble dry matter     0.97         3.38         1.43       7.66 per cent.
Ash                    0.16         0.40         0.28       1.26  "   "
Alkalinity as K{2}O   0.02         0.082        0.084      0.21  "   "

The loss on soaking in cold water, unless the water is preserved, is seen to be considerable.
The split lentils, having had the protecting skin removed, lose most. In every case the ash
contained a good deal of phosphate and lime. Potatoes are rich in important potash salts; by
boiling a large quantity is lost, by steaming less and by baking in the skins, scarcely any.
The flavour is also much better after baking.

The usual addition of common salt (sodium-chloride) to boiled potatoes is no proper substitute
for the loss of their natural saline constituents. Natural and properly cooked foods are so
rich in sodium chloride and other salts that the addition of common salt is unnecessary. An
excess of the latter excites thirst and spoils the natural flavour of the food. It is the custom,
especially in restaurants, to add a large quantity of salt to pulse, savoury food, potatoes
and soups. Bakers' brown bread is usually very salt, and sometimes white is also. In some persons
much salt causes irritation of the skin, and the writer has knowledge of the salt food of vegetarian
restaurants causing or increasing dandruff. As a rule, fondness for salt is an acquired taste,
and after its discontinuance for a time, food thus flavoured becomes unpalatable.

Organic Compounds are formed by living organisms (a few can also be produced by chemical means).
They are entirely decomposed by combustion.

The Non-Nitrogenous Organic Compounds are commonly called carbon compounds or heat-producers,
but these terms are also descriptive of the nitrogenous compounds. These contain carbon, hydrogen
and oxygen only, and furnish by their oxidation or combustion in the body the necessary heat,
muscular and nervous energy. The final product of their combustion is water and carbon dioxide
(carbonic acid gas).

The Carbohydrates comprise starch, sugar, gum, mucilage, pectose, glycogen, &c.; cellulose
and woody fibre are carbohydrates, but are little capable of digestion. They contain hydrogen
and oxygen in the proportion to form water, the carbon alone being available to produce heat
by combustion. Starch is the most widely distributed food. It is insoluble in water, but when
cooked is readily digested and absorbed by the body. Starch is readily converted into sugar,
whether in plants or animals, during digestion. There are many kinds of sugar, such as grape,
cane and milk sugars.

The Oils and Fats consist of the same elements as the carbohydrates, but the hydrogen is in
larger quantity than is necessary to form water, and this surplus is available for the production
of energy. During their combustion in the body they produce nearly two-and-a-quarter times
(4 : 8.9 = 2.225) as much heat as the carbohydrates; but if eaten in more than small quantities,
they are not easily digested, a portion passing away by the intestines. The fat in the body
is not solely dependent upon the quantity consumed as food, as an animal may become quite fat
on food containing none. A moderate quantity favours digestion and the bodily health. In cold
weather more should be taken. In the Arctic regions the Esquimaux consume enormous quantities.
Nuts are generally rich in oil. Oatmeal contains more than any of the other cereals (27 analyses
gave from 8 to 12.3 per cent.)

The most esteemed and dearest oil is Almond. What is called Peach-kernel oil (Oleum Amygdalæ
Persicæ), but which in commerce includes the oil obtained from plum and apricot stones, is
almost as tasteless and useful, whilst it is considerably cheaper. It is a very agreeable and
useful food. It is often added to, as an adulterant, or substituted for the true Almond oil.
The best qualities of Olive oil are much esteemed, though they are not as agreeable to English
taste as the oil previously mentioned. The best qualities are termed Virgin, Extra Sublime
and Sublime. Any that has been exposed for more than a short time to the light and heat of
a shop window should be rejected, as the flavour is affected. It should be kept in a cool place.
Not only does it vary much in freedom from acid and rancidity, but is frequently adulterated.
Two other cheaper oils deserve mention. The "cold-drawn" Arachis oil (pea-nut or earth-nut
oil) has a pleasant flavour, resembling that of kidney beans. The "cold-drawn" Sesamé oil has
an agreeable taste, and is considered equal to Olive oil for edible purposes. The best qualities
are rather difficult to obtain; those usually sold being much inferior to Peach-kernel and
Olive oils. Cotton-seed oil is the cheapest of the edible ones. Salad oil, not sold under any
descriptive name, is usually refined Cotton-seed oil, with perhaps a little Olive oil to impart
a richer flavour.

The solid fats sold as butter and lard substitutes, consist of deodorised cocoanut oil, and
they are excellent for cooking purposes. It is claimed that biscuits, &c., made from them may
be kept for a much longer period, without showing any trace of rancidity, than if butter or
lard had been used. They are also to be had agreeably flavoured by admixture with almond, walnut,
&c., "cream."

The better quality oils are quite as wholesome as the best fresh butter, and better than most
butter as sold. Bread can be dipped into the oil, or a little solid vegetable fat spread on
it. The author prefers to pour a little Peach-kernel oil upon some ground walnut kernels (or
other ground nuts in themselves rich in oil), mix with a knife to a suitable consistency and
spread upon the bread. Pine-kernels are very oily, and can be used in pastry in the place of
butter or lard.

Whenever oils are mentioned, without a prefix, the fixed or fatty oils are always understood.
The volatile or essential oils are a distinct class. Occasionally, the fixed oils are called
hydrocarbons, but hydrocarbon oils are quite different and consist of carbon and hydrogen alone.
Of these, petroleum is incapable of digestion, whilst others are poisonous.

Vegetable Acids are composed of the same three elements and undergo combustion into the same
compounds as the carbohydrates. They rouse the appetite, stimulate digestion, and finally form
carbonates in combination with the alkalies, thus increasing the alkalinity of the blood. The
chief vegetable acids are: malic acid, in the apple, pear, cherry, &c.; citric acid, in the
lemon, lime, orange, gooseberry, cranberry, strawberry, raspberry, &c.; tartaric acid, in the
grape, pineapple, &c.

Some place these under Class III. or food adjuncts. Oxalic acid (except when in the insoluble
state of calcium oxalate), and several other acids are poisonous.

Proteids or Albuminoids are frequently termed flesh-formers. They are composed of nitrogen,
carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and a small quantity of sulphur, and are extremely complex bodies.
Their chief function is to form flesh in the body; but without previously forming it, they
may be transformed into fat or merely give rise to heat. They form the essential part of every
living cell.

Proteids are excreted from the body as water, carbon dioxide, urea, uric acid, sulphates, &c.

The principal proteids of animal origin have their corresponding proteids in the vegetable
kingdom. Some kinds, whether of animal or vegetable origin, are more easily digested than others.
They have the same physiological value from whichever kingdom they are derived.

The Osseids comprise ossein, gelatin, cartilage, &c., from bone, skin, and connective issue.
They approach the proteids in composition, but unlike them they cannot form flesh or fulfil
the same purpose in nutrition. Some food chemists wish to call the osseids, albuminoids; what
were formerly termed albuminoids to be always spoken of as proteids only.

Jellies are of little use as food; not only is this because of the low nutritive value of gelatin,
but also on account of the small quantity which is mixed with a large proportion of water.

The Vegetable Kingdom is the prime source of all organic food; water, and to a slight extent
salts, form the only food that animals can derive directly from the inorganic kingdom. When
man consumes animal food--a sheep for example--he is only consuming a portion of the food which
that sheep obtained from grass, clover, turnips, &c. All the proteids of the flesh once existed
as proteids in the vegetables; some in exactly the same chemical form.

Flesh contains no starch or sugar, but a small quantity of glycogen. The fat in an animal is
derived from the carbohydrates, the fats and the proteids of the vegetables consumed. The soil
that produced the herbage, grain and roots consumed by cattle, in most cases could have produced
food capable of direct utilisation by man. By passing the product of the soil through animals
there is an enormous economic loss, as the greater part of that food is dissipated in maintaining
the life and growth; little remains as flesh when the animal is delivered into the hands of
the butcher. Some imagine that flesh food is more easily converted into flesh and blood in
our bodies and is consequently more valuable than similar constituents in vegetables, but such
is not the case. Fat, whether from flesh or from vegetables is digested in the same manner.
The proteids of flesh, like those of vegetables, are converted into peptone by the digestive
juices--taking the form of a perfectly diffusible liquid--otherwise they could not be absorbed
and utilised by the body. Thus the products of digestion of both animal and vegetable proteids
and fats are the same. Formerly, proteid matter was looked upon as the most valuable part of
the food, and a large proportion was thought necessary for hard work. It was thought to be
required, not only for the construction of the muscle substance, but to be utilised in proportion
to muscular exertion. These views are now known to be wrong. A comparatively small quantity
of proteid matter, such as is easily obtained from vegetable food, is ample for the general
needs of the body. Increased muscular exertion requires but a slight increase of this food
constituent. It is the carbohydrates, or carbohydrates and fats that should be eaten in larger
quantity, as these are the main source of muscular energy. The fact that animals, capable of
the most prolonged and powerful exertion, thrive on vegetables of comparatively low proteid
value, and that millions of the strongest races have subsisted on what most Englishmen would
consider a meagre vegetarian diet, should have been sufficient evidence against the earlier view.

A comparison of flesh and vegetable food, shows in flesh an excessive quantity of proteid matter,
a very small quantity of glycogen (the animal equivalent of starch and sugar) and a variable
quantity of fat. Vegetable food differs much, but as a rule it contains a much smaller quantity
of proteid matter, a large proportion of starch and sugar and a small quantity of fat. Some
vegetable foods, particularly nuts, contain much fat.

Investigation of the digestive processes has shown that the carbohydrates and fats entail little
strain on the system; their ultimate products are water and carbon dioxide, which are easily
disposed of. The changes which the proteids undergo in the body are very complicated. There
is ample provision in the body for their digestion, metabolism, and final rejection, when taken
in moderate quantity, as is the case in a dietary of vegetables. The proteids in the human
body, after fulfilling their purpose, are in part expelled in the same way as the carbohydrates;
but the principal part, including all the nitrogen, is expelled by the kidneys in the form
of urea (a very soluble substance), and a small quantity of uric acid in the form of quadurates.

There is reciprocity between the teeth and digestive organs of animals and their natural food.
The grasses, leaves, &c., which are consumed by the herbivora, contain a large proportion of
cellulose and woody tissue. Consequently, the food is bulky; it is but slowly disintegrated
and the nutritious matter liberated and digested. The cellulose appears but slightly acted
upon by the digestive juices. The herbivora possess capacious stomachs and the intestines are
very long. The carnivora have simpler digestive organs and short intestines. Even they consume
substances which leave much indigestible residue, such as skin, ligaments and bones, but civilised
man, when living on a flesh dietary removes as much of such things as possible. The monkeys,
apes, and man (comprised in the order Primates) have a digestive canal intermediate in complexity
and in length to the herbivora and carnivora. A certain quantity of indigestible matter is
necessary for exciting peristaltic action of the bowels. The carnivora with their short intestinal
canal need the least, the frugivora more, and the herbivora a much larger quantity. The consumption
by man of what is commonly called concentrated food is the cause of the constipation to which
flesh-eating nations are subject. Most of the pills and other nostrums which are used in enormous
quantities contain aloes or other drugs which stimulate the action of the intestines.

Highly manufactured foods, from which as much as possible of the non-nutritious matter has
been removed is often advocated, generally by those interested in its sale. Such food would
be advantageous only if it were possible to remove or modify a great part of our digestive
canal (we are omitting from consideration certain diseased conditions, when such foods may
be useful). The eminent physiologist and bacteriologist, Elie Metchnikoff, has given it as
his opinion that much of man's digestive organs is not only useless but often productive of
derangement and disease. In several cases where it has been necessary, in consequence of serious
disease, to remove the entire stomach or a large part of the intestines, the digestive functions
have been perfectly performed. It is not that our organs are at fault, but our habits of life
differ from that of our progenitors. In past times, when a simple dietary in which flesh food
formed little or no part, and to-day, in those countries where one wholly or nearly all derived
from vegetable sources and simply prepared is the rule, diseases of the digestive organs are
rare. The Englishman going to a tropical country and partaking largely of flesh and alcohol,
suffers from disease of the liver and other organs, to which the natives and the few of his
own countrymen, living in accordance with natural laws are strangers.

Indigestible Matter--Food is never entirely digested. As a reason against confining ourselves
solely to vegetable food, it has been stated that such is less perfectly digested than animal
food and that it therefore throws more work on the digestive organs. It is also urged that
on this account a greater quantity of vegetable food is required. We have shown elsewhere that,
on the contrary, vegetarians are satisfied with a smaller amount of food. Man requires a small
quantity of woody fibre or cellulose in his food to stimulate intestinal action and prevent
constipation.

It is difficult to determine how much of a food is unassimilated in the body. This is for the
reason of the intestinal refuse consisting not only of undigested food, but also of residues
of the digestive juices, mucus and epithelial debris. These latter have been shown to amount
to from one-third to one-half of the whole of the fæces, which is much more than had previously
been supposed.

John Goodfellow has shown that of very coarse wholemeal bread quite 14 per cent. was undigested,
whilst bread made from ordinary grade wholemeal showed 12.5 per cent. Such a method of analysis
was adopted as it was believed would exclude other than the food waste. The experiments were
made on a person who was eating nothing but the bread. It seems probable that a smaller proportion
would have remained unassimilated had the bread not formed the sole food. It is advisable that
wheatmeal he ground as finely as possible, the coarse is not only to a less extent assimilated
but apt to irritate the bowels. Notwithstanding that fine white bread gave only 4.2 per cent.
and a coarse white bread 4.9 per cent. of waste, a fine wheatmeal bread is more economical
as the same quantity of wheat produces a greater weight of flour richer in proteid and mineral
matter. From a large number of experiments with man, it has been calculated that of proteids
there is digested when animal food is eaten 98 per cent., from cereals and sugars 8 per cent.,
from vegetables and fruits 80 per cent. The difference between the proportions digested of
the other food constituents was much less. Although there is here a theoretical advantage in
favour of animal food, there are other considerations of far more importance than a little
undigestible waste. The main question is one of health. In some dietary experiments of a girl
aged 7, living upon a fruit diet, of whom we have given some particulars elsewhere, Professor
Jaffa gives the following particulars. During the ten days trial the percentages absorbed were
proteids 82.5, fat 86.9, nitrogen free extract 96, crude fibre 80, ash 5.7, heat of combustion
in calories 86.7. He says, "generally speaking, the food was quite thoroughly assimilated,
the coefficients of digestibility being about the same as are found in an ordinary mixed diet.
It is interesting to note that 80 per cent. of the crude fibre appeared to be digested. The
results of a number of foreign experiments on the digestibility of crude fibre by man are from
30 to 91.4 per cent., the former value being from mixed wheat and rye, and the latter in a
diet made of rice, vegetables and meat."

NOTES ON THE TABLE OF ANALYSIS.--Under calories are shown kilo-calories per pound of food.
In the analysis marked U the crude fibre or cellulose is included with the carbo-hydrate, the
figures being those given in Atwater's table. He has found that from 30 to 91 per cent. of
the crude fibre was digested, according to the kind of food. The term fibre or cellulose in
analytical tables is not a very definite one. It depends upon the details of the method of
analysis. In the analyses other than U, the cellulose is excluded in calculating the calories.
Nutrient ratio is the proportion of the sum of the carbo-hydrate and fat, compared with the
proteid as 1. The fat has first been multiplied by 2.225 to bring it to the same nutrient value
as the carbo-hydrate.

U indicates that the analyses are taken from the United States Department of Agriculture Experimental
Station, Bulletin 28, the tests being chiefly made by Dr. W.O. Atwater, or under his direction.
They are average analyses of several samples. The refuse consists of such parts as are rejected
in preparing the food; the outer leaves, skin, stalk, seeds, &c., of vegetables; the shell
of eggs; the bone, &c., of meat. E, indicates that the edible portion only of the food has
been analysed, and under refuse, in brackets, is shown the quantity rejected before the analysis
was made.

There is considerable variation in the same kind of food, according to the variety of seed
and conditions of growth &c., especially is this the case with wheat and flour; whenever it
has been possible the average of the analyses of many samples have been given. The method of
analysis has not always been uniform, frequently the cellulose is included with the carbo-hydrates,
and the proteid sometimes includes a very appreciable quantity of non-proteid nitrogenous matter.
This is the case in the analysis of the mushrooms. G.--Analyses are by John Goodfellow; it
will be noticed that the wheatmeal bread is not made from the same flour as the whole-meal.
D.--B. Dyer, average of 19 fine and coarse oatmeals. S, from U.S. Cons. Reports, 1899. C.--A.H.
Church. The walnut kernels are in the dried condition as purchased; originally of the same
composition as shewn in the fresh kernels. C.D.--Cavendish or Figi variety of banana, analysis
by D.W.M. Doherty, N.S. Wales. P.--A. Petermann, U.S. Cons. Banana flour, musca paradisiaca
variety. This is widely used in Central America. The flour is from the unripe fruit, and contains
starch 45.7 per cent.; on ripening the starch is converted into sugar. K.--Konig, mean of 90
analysis. Milk:--Average of many thousand analyses of the pure. Butter.--Made without salt.
L, from the "Lancet," 1903, I, p. 72. Oysters at 2/6 per dozen. The 8.09 per cent. includes
0.91 glycogen (animal starch). The shell was of course excluded, also the liquid in the shell.
Apples.--The refuse includes seeds, skin, &c., and such edible portion as is wasted in cutting
them away; the analysis was made on the rest.

Cookery.--Flesh is easier to digest raw. A few, on the advice of their doctors, eat minced
raw flesh, raw beef juice and even fresh warm blood. Such practice is abhorrent to every person
of refinement. Cooking lessens the offensive appearance and qualities of flesh and changes
the flavour; thorough cooking also destroys any parasites that may be present. Raw flesh is
more stimulating to the animal passions, and excites ferocity in both man and animals. If the
old argument was valid, that as flesh is much nearer in composition and quality to our own
flesh and tissues, it is therefore our best food, we do wrong in coagulating the albuminoids,
hardening the muscle substance and scorching it by cooking.

Fruits when ripe and in good condition are best eaten raw; cooking spoils the flavour. Food
requiring mastication and encouraging insalivation is the best. Food is frequently made too
sloppy or liquid, and is eaten too hot, thus favouring indigestion and decay of the teeth.
The cereals and pulses can only with difficulty be eaten raw. When cooked in water the starch
granules swell and break up, the plant cells are ruptured, the fibres are separated and the
nutritious matter rendered easy of digestion. The flavour is greatly improved. Cooking increases
our range and variety of food. The civilised races use it to excess and over-season their dishes,
favouring over-eating.

If baking powders are used they should only be of the best makes. They should be composed of
sodium bicarbonate and tartaric acid, in such correct proportions that upon the addition of
water only sodium tartrate and carbon dioxide (carbonic acid) should result. Some powders contain
an excess of sodium bicarbonate. Self-raising flours should be avoided. They are commonly composed
of--in addition to sodium bicarbonate--acid calcium phosphate, calcium superphosphate and calcium
sulphate. Common baking powders often consist of the same ingredients, and sometimes also of
magnesia and alum. These are often made and sold by ignorant men, whose sole object is to make
money. Calcium superphosphate and acid calcium phosphate very frequently contain arsenic, and
as the cheap commercial qualities are often used there is danger in this direction. A good
formula for baking powder is, tartaric acid 8 ozs., sodium bicarbonate 9 ozs., rice flour 10
to 20 ozs. The last is added to baking powders to improve the keeping quality and to add bulk.
The ingredients must be first carefully dried, the sodium bicarbonate at not too high a temperature
or it decomposes, and then thoroughly mixed; this must be preserved in well closed and dry
bottles. Another formula, which is slow rising and well adapted for pastry, is sodium bicarbonate
4 ozs., cream of tartar 9 ozs., rice flour about 14 ozs. Custard powders consist of starch,
colouring and flavouring. Egg powders are similar to baking powders but contain yellow colouring.
Little objection can be taken to them if they are coloured with saffron; turmeric would do
if it were not that it gives a slightly unpleasant taste. Artificial colouring matters or coal
tar derivatives are much used, several of these are distinctly poisonous.

Drinks.--It is better not to drink during eating, or insalivation may be interfered with; a
drink is better taken at the end of a meal. The practice of washing down food with hot tea
is bad. The refreshing nature of a cup of hot tea, coffee, or cocoa is to a very great extent
due to the warmth of the water. The benefit is felt at once, before the alkaloid can enter
the blood stream and stimulate the nerve centres. Hot water, not too hot to cause congestion
of the mucous membrane, is one of the best drinks. When the purity of the water supply is doubtful,
there is advantage in first bringing it to the boil, as pathogenic bacteria are destroyed.
Some find it beneficial to drink a cup of hot water the first thing in the morning; this cleanses
the stomach from any accumulation of mucus.

If fruit, succulent vegetables, or cooked food, containing much water be freely used, and there
be little perspiration, it is possible to do without drinking; but there is danger of taking
insufficient water to hold freely in solution the waste products excreted by the body.

Aerated drinks, except a very few of the best, and non-alcoholic beers and wines, are generally
unwholesome, from their containing preservatives, foaming powders, artificial flavourings, &c.

Stimulants.--Tea and coffee contain an alkaloid theine, besides volatile oils, tannin, &c.
Cocoa contains the milder alkaloid, theobromine. They stimulate the heart and nervous systems;
tea and coffee have also a diuretic effect. Formerly they were erroneously thought to lessen
tissue waste. These alkaloids, being purins, are open to the general objections named elsewhere.
Stimulants do not impart energy or force of any kind, but only call forth reserve strength
by exciting the heart, nervous system, &c., to increased activity. This is followed by a depression
which is as great, generally greater, than the previous stimulation. Except, perhaps, as an
occasional medicine, stimulants, should be avoided. Analysis of cocoa shows a good proportion
of proteids and a very large quantity of fat. The claim that it is a valuable and nutritious
food would only be true if it could be eaten in such quantities as are other foods (bread,
fruits, &c.). Were this attempted, poisoning would result from the large quantity of alkaloid.
The food value of half a spoonful or thereabouts of cocoa is insignificant. Certain much advertised
cocoa mixtures are ridiculous in their pretentions, unscientific in preparation, and often
injurious.

Cereals.--The most valuable is wheat, from its proteid being chiefly in the form known as gluten.
From its tenacity, gluten enables a much better loaf to be produced from wheat than from any
other cereal. The outer part of the grain is the richest in mineral matter and proteid. Wheatmeal
bread shows a considerably higher proteid value than white. A large proportion of the proteid
in the outer coats of the wheat berry is, however, not digested, and in some experiments the
waste has been enough to quite nullify its seeming advantage over white bread. Coarsely ground,
sharp branny particles in bread irritate the intestines, and cause excessive waste of nutriment;
but finely ground wheatmeal is free from this objection, and is beneficial in preventing constipation.
The comparative value of white and brown bread has been much discussed; it depends both on
the quality of the bread and the condition of the digestive organs. Experiments on the digestion
of bread and other things, have often been made on persons unaccustomed to such foods, or the
foods have been given in excessive quantity. To those accustomed to it good wheatmeal bread
is much pleasanter, more satisfying, and better flavoured than white; indeed, the latter is
described as insipid. Most bakers' bread is of unsatisfactory quality. Flour and bread contain
very little fat, the absence of which is considered a defect. This is remedied by the addition
of butter, fat or oil, or by nuts, &c., which are rich in oil. These may be mixed with the
flour prior to cooking, or used afterwards.

Oats contain a substance called avenin, apparently an alkaloid, which has an irritating action;
the quantity is variable. It is to this that the so-called heating effect of oatmeal on some
persons is due.

Prepared Cereals or Breakfast Foods.--Analyses were made of 34 of these cereal preparations
by Weems and Ellis (Iowa State College Agricultural Bulletin, 1904). They report that the foods
possess no nutritive value in excess of ordinary food materials; that the claim made for many
pre-digested foods are valueless, and no reliance can be placed on the statement that they
are remedies for any disease.

Oatmeal and other cereals are sold in packets as being partially cooked. We do not doubt that
they have been subjected to a dry heat, but this has scarcely any effect on their starch and
other constituents. The difference is a mechanical one. In rolled oats the grains are so cracked
and broken, that on boiling with water, the water readily penetrates and more quickly cooks
them throughout. There are other prepared cereal foods, but we doubt whether they are thoroughly
cooked after the short boiling directed on the labels. They are a great convenience where it
is difficult to get the time necessary for cooking the ordinary cereals. Coarsely ground wheat
is too irritating when made into porridge, but there are some granulated wheats sold in packets,
which are quite suitable. The Ralston breakfast food is excellent. They are rich in the phosphates
and salts, found in the outer part of the grain. One cereal preparation called Grape Nuts,
has had its starch converted into maltose and dextrin (maltose being a sugar), by a scientific
application of the diastase of the grain. It is consequently easier of digestion and requires
no cooking. It is beneficial for some forms of indigestion. There are several competing foods
of less merit, the starch being less perfectly changed; one at least of which is objectionably
salt. Properly cooked starch is readily digested by healthy persons, and for them malted food
is of no special value.

Pulse, or Legumes, includes haricots and other beans, peas and lentils. The proteid contained
is that variety known as legumin, which is either the same, or is closely allied, to the casein
of milk and cheese. Pulse is very rich in proteid, the dried kinds in general use, contain
24 or 25 per cent. The richest is the soy-bean, which is used in China and Japan, it contains
35 per cent., besides 19 per cent. of fat. Pulse requires thorough cooking, haricots taking
the longest time. Split lentils are cooked sooner, and are better digested; this is chiefly
due to the removal of the skins. The haricots, bought from small grocers who have a slow sale,
are often old, and will not cook tender. Pulse is best adapted to the labouring classes; the
sedentary should eat it sparingly, it is liable to cause flatulence or accumulation of gas
in the intestines, and constipation. Haricots are easier to digest when mashed and mixed with
other food. Pulse was formerly stated to leave much undigested residue. Recent experiments
have shown that it is satisfactorily digested under favourable conditions. Strümpell found
beans in their skins to leave a large proportion of proteid matter unabsorbed. Lentil meal
mixed with other food was digested in a perfectly satisfactory manner. Another experimenter
(Rubner) found that when even the very large quantity of 1-1/8 pound of dried split peas per
day were eaten, only 17 per cent. of proteid matter was unabsorbed, which compares very well
with the 11 per cent. of proteid left from a macaroni diet, with which the same man was fed
at another time. Had a reasonable quantity of peas been eaten per day, the quantity undigested
would probably have differed little from that of other foods.

Nuts are, as a rule, very rich in oil and contain a fair proportion of proteid; when well masticated
they are a very valuable food. Walnuts are one of the best, and the kernels can be purchased
shelled, thus avoiding much trouble. They can be finely ground in a nut-mill and used for several
purposes, mixed in the proportion of about two ounces to the pound of wheatmeal they produce
a rich flavoured bread. They can also he used in sweet cakes and in rich puddings to increase
their food value, lightness and taste. Pine kernels being very oily, can be used with flour
in the place of lard or butter.

Fruits are generally looked upon as luxuries, rather than as food capable of supplying a meal
or a substantial part of one. They are usually eaten only when the appetite has been appeased
by what is considered more substantial fare. Fresh fruits contain a larger proportion of water
than nearly all other raw foods, and consequently the proportion of nourishment is small; but
we must not despise them on this account. Milk contains as much or more water. Certain foods
which in the raw state contain very little water, such as the pulses and cereals when cooked
absorb a very large quantity; this is particularly the case in making porridge. Cabbage, cauliflower,
Spanish onions and turnips, after cooking contain even 97 per cent. of water. Roast beef contains
on an average 48 per cent., and cooked round steak with fat removed 63 per cent. of water.
It is customary at meal times to drink water, tea, coffee, beer, wine, &c. When a meal contains
any considerable quantity of fresh fruits there need be no desire to drink. Notwithstanding
that fruits contain so much water, a dietary consisting of fruits with nuts, to which may be
added bread and vegetables, will contain less water than the total quantity usually consumed
by a person taking the more customary highly cooked and seasoned foods. An advantage is that
the water in fruits is in a wholesome condition, free from the pollution often met with in
the water used for drinking purposes. Raw fruits favour mastication, with its consequent advantages,
whilst cooked and soft food discourages it. Plums and what are termed stone fruits, if eaten
in more than very small quantities, are apt to disagree. Persons with good digestions can take
fruit with bread, biscuits and with uncooked foods without any inconvenience. Fruit is more
likely to disagree when taken in conjunction with elaborately cooked foods. Many cannot take
fruit, especially if it be acid, at the same time as cereal or starchy substances, and the
difficulty is said to be greater at the morning's meal. If the indigestion produced is due
to the acid of the fruit preventing the saliva acting on the starch, scientific principles
would direct that the fruit be eaten quite towards the end of the meal. The same consideration
condemns the use of mint sauce, cucumber and vinegar, or pickles, with potatoes and bread,
or even mint sauce with green peas. Bananas are an exception, as not interfering with the digestion
of starch. Bananas are generally eaten in an unripe condition, white and somewhat mealy; they
should be kept until the starch has been converted into sugar, when they are both more pleasant
and wholesome. Nuts and fruit go well together. For a portable meal, stoned raisins or other
dried fruit and walnut kernels or other nuts are excellent.

What has been called a defect in most fruits, is the fact that the proteid is small in proportion
to the other constituents. This has been too much dwelt upon, owing to the prevailing exaggerated
idea of the quantity of proteid required. The tomato contains a large proportion, though the
water is very high. Bananas, grapes and strawberries contain to each part of proteid from 10
to 12 parts of other solid nutritive constituents (any oil being calculated into starch equivalents);
this is termed the nutritive ratio. Although this may seem a small proportion of proteid, there
are reasons for believing that it is sufficient. Taking the average of 29 analyses of American
apples, a nutritive ratio of 33 was obtained. If it were suggested that life should be sustained
on apples alone, this small quantity of proteid would be an insurmountable difficulty. As the
addition of nuts or other nutritious food sufficiently increases the proteid, no objection
can with justice be made against the use of fruit. A study of our teeth, digestive organs and
general structure, and of comparative anatomy, points to fruits, nuts and succulent vegetables
as our original diet.

The potash and other salts of the organic acids in fruits tend to keep the blood properly alkaline.
Where there is a tendency to the deposition of uric acid in the body, they hinder its formation.
Citric, tartaric, malic and other organic acids exist in fruits in combination with potash
and other bases, as well as in the free state. The free acids in fruits, when eaten, combine
with the alkalies in the intestinal tract, and are absorbed by the body and pass into the blood,
not as acids, but as neutral salts. Here they are converted into potassium carbonate or some
other carbonate. Fruit acids never make the blood acid but the reverse. Fruit salts and acids
are antiscorbutic. Fruits have often proved of the greatest benefit in illness. What is known
as the grape cure has been productive of much good. Lemons and oranges have also been of great
benefit. Strawberries have been craved for and have proved of the greatest advantage in some
extreme cases of illness when more concentrated food could not be endured. Fruit is coming
into greater use, especially owing to its better distribution and lessened cost. Fruit is not
as cheap as it should be, as it can be produced in great abundance at little cost, and with
comparatively little labour. The price paid by the public greatly exceeds the real cost of
production. A very large proportion, often the greater part of the cost to the consumer, goes
in railway and other rates and in middle-men's profits. It is commonly cheaper to bring fruit
from over the sea, including land carriage on either side, than it is to transport English
produce from one part of our country to another. English homegrown fruit would be cheaper were
it not for the difficulty of buying suitable land at a reasonable price, and the cost of transit.
For the production of prime fruit there is a lack of sufficient intelligence, of scientific
culture and co-operation.

Vegetables--using the name in its popular sense--contain valuable saline constituents or salts.
By the usual method of cooking a large proportion of the salts is lost. It is better to steam
than to boil them. The fibrous portion of vegetables is not all digested, but it is useful
in stimulating the peristaltic action of the bowels and lessening any tendency to constipation.
Vegetables are more especially useful to non-vegetarians to correct the defects of their other
food.

The potato belongs to a poisonous order--the Solanacæ. There is a little alkaloid in the skin,
but this is lost in the cooking. The eyes and sprouting portions contain the most and should
be cut out.

Fungi.--There are about a hundred edible species in this country, but many of the fungi are
poisonous, some intensely so. It can scarcely be expected that these lowly organised plants,
differing so much in their manner of growth from the green or chlorophyll bearing plants, can
be particularly nourishing. It is only the fructifying part, which appears above the ground,
that is generally eaten. It is of very rapid growth. Of 9 edible fungi of 4 species, obtained
in the Belgrade market, the average amount of water was 89.3 per cent., leaving only 10.7 per
cent. of solid matter; the average of fat was 0.55 per cent. The food value of fungi has been
greatly over-rated. In most of the analyses given in text-books and elsewhere, the total nitrogen
has been multiplied by 6.25 and the result expressed as proteid. The amount of nitrogen in
a form useless for the purpose of nutrition is about a third of the whole. Of the remainder
or proteid nitrogen, it is said much is not assimilated, sometimes quite half, owing to the
somewhat indigestible character of the fungi. An analysis of the common mushroom gave proteids
2.2 per cent., amides (useless nitrogenous compounds) 1.3 per cent., and water 93.7 per cent.
The fungi are of inferior nutritive value to many fresh vegetables and are much more expensive.
Their chief value is as a flavouring.

Milk and Eggs are permissible in a vegetarian dietary, and as a rule, vegetarians use them.
Eggs, with the exception of such as are unfertile, are of course alive; but they have no conscious
existence, and cannot be said to suffer any pain on being killed and eaten. An objection to
their use as food is, that on an egg and poultry farm, the superfluous male birds are killed,
and as the hens become unprofitable layers they are also killed. A similar humane objection
applies to the use of cow's milk by man. The calves are deprived of part of their natural food,
the deficiency being perhaps made up by unnatural farinaceous milk substitutes. Many of the
calves, especially the bull calves, are killed, thus leaving all the milk for human use. When
cows cease to yield sufficient milk they too are slaughtered. Milch cows are commonly kept
in unhealthy houses, deprived of exercise and pure air, crowded together, with filthy evil
smelling floors reeking with their excrements, tended by uncleanly people. With no exercise
and a rich stimulating diet they produce more milk; but it is no matter for surprise that tuberculosis
is common amongst them. When the lesions of tubercle (consumption) are localised and not excessive,
the rest of the carcase is passed by veterinary surgeons as fit for food; were it otherwise,
enormous quantities of meat would be destroyed. As butcher's meat is seldom officially inspected,
but a very small part is judged by the butchers as too bad for food. In mitigation it may be
said that poultry lead a happy existence and their death is, or should be, quickly produced
with but little pain, probably less pain than if left to die from natural causes. The same
cannot be said of cattle and sheep when the time arrives for their transport to the slaughter
man's. It is argued by vegetarians who take milk and animal products that they are not responsible
for the death of the animals, as they do not eat their flesh. As vegetarians profit by conditions
in which the slaughtering of the animals is a part, they cannot be altogether exonerated. Cow's
milk is prone to absorb bad odours, and it forms a most suitable breeding or nutrient medium
for most species of bacteria which may accidentally get therein. By means of milk many epidemics
have been spread, of scarlet fever, diphtheria, cholera, and typhoid. Occasionally milk contains
tubercle bacilli from the cows themselves. By boiling, all bacteria, except a few which may
be left out of consideration, are destroyed. Such a temperature, however, renders the milk
less digestible and wholesome for infants. By heating to 160° F. or 170° F. for a few minutes,
such pathogenic germs as are at all likely to be in milk (tubercle, typhoid, diphtheria, &c.)
are killed, and the value of the milk is but little affected: this is called Pasteurising.
It was until quite recently a common practice to add boric acid, formaldehyde and other preservatives;
this has injured the vitality and caused the death of many infants. They have not yet gone
quite out of use.

For infants the only satisfactory food is that of a healthy mother. On account of physical
defects in the mother, or often for merely selfish reasons, the infant is deprived of its natural
food. Many attempts have been made to bring cow's milk to approximately the same composition
as human milk. It can be done by adding water, milk sugar and cream of known composition, in
certain proportions. Great difficulties are met with when this is put into practice. The simplest
method is that of Professor Soxhlet. The proper quantity of milk sugar is added, but instead
of adding the right quantity of cream or fat--a very difficult thing to do--the equivalent
quantity of extra milk sugar is used. Although not theoretically satisfactory, in practice
it answers very well. We have found it to agree very well with infants. To cow's milk of pure
average quality, add half its volume of water containing 12.3 per cent. of milk sugar; or,
what amounts to the same thing, to a pint of cow's milk add one and a quarter ounce of milk
sugar and half-a-pint of water. It is preferable to Pasteurise by placing the bottle of milk
in a vessel of water. This water is to be heated until the milk shows a temperature of about
75° C. or 165° F., but must not exceed 80° C. or a change in the albumen of the milk takes
place which affects its digestibility. Keep at this temperature for about ten minutes. If not
required at once, a plug of cotton wool should be placed in the neck of the bottle, and it
should be kept in a cold place until required. Professor Soxhlet does not advise the addition
of lime water. The proteids are not of the same composition as in human milk (the calf being
a ruminating animal)--and it is a common plan to add water or barley water to milk until it
is so watered down that it cannot curdle into tough curds. An infant has thus either to distend
its stomach with a large quantity of watery nourishment, or else to get insufficient food.
Sometimes it is necessary to peptonise the milk a little. At the Leipzig infants hospital,
and also the Hygienic Institute, they give to infants, up to 9 months old, Prof. Soxhlet's
mixture, except that an equal volume of water is added to the milk. Milk, cheese, and especially
hen's eggs contain a very large proportion of proteid. When added to food poor in proteid they
improve its nutritive quality. It has often been said, and with truth, that some vegetarians
by the profuse use of animal products, consume as much, or even more proteid of animal origin
than the average person who includes flesh food in his dietary. An excess of proteid from these
sources is less injurious as eggs contain no purins, and milk but a very small quantity. In
support of the use of animal products, it may be said that we have become so fond of animal
foods and stimulating drinks, that the use of milk, butter, cheese and eggs renders the transition
to a dietary derived from the vegetable kingdom much easier. By means of these, cooked dishes
can be produced which approach and sometimes can scarcely be distinguished from those of cooked
flesh.

In the present state of society, when really good vegetarian fare is difficult to procure away
from home, eggs, cheese, and milk are a great convenience.

Digestion.--The digestive juices contain certain unorganised ferments, which produce chemical
changes in the food. If the food is solid, it has to be liquefied. Even if already liquid it
has generally to undergo a chemical change before being fitted for absorption into the body.
The alimentary canal is a tubular passage which is first expanded into the mouth, and later
into the stomach. As the food passes down, it is acted upon by several digestive juices, and
in the small intestine the nutritive matter is absorbed, whilst the residue passes away.

The saliva is the first digestive juice. It is alkaline and contains a ferment called ptyalin.
This acts energetically on the cooked and gelatinous starch, and slowly on the raw starch.
Starch is quite insoluble in water, but the first product of salivary digestion is a less complex
substance called soluble-starch. When time is allowed for the action to be completed, the starch
is converted into one of the sugars called maltose. In infants this property of acting on starch
does not appear in effective degree until the sixth or seventh month, and starch should not
be given before that time. Only a small quantity should be provided before the twelfth month,
when it may be gradually increased. Dr. Sims Wallace has suggested that the eruption of the
lower incisors from the seventh to the eighth month, was for the purpose of enabling the infant--in
the pre-cooking stage of man's existence--to pierce the outer covering of fruits so as to permit
his extracting the soluble contents by suction; and accordingly when these teeth are cut we
may allow the child to bite at such vegetable substances as apples, oranges, and sugar cane.
Dr. Harry Campbell says that starch should be given to the young, "not as is the custom, as
liquid or pap, but in a form compelling vigorous mastication, for it is certain that early
man, from the time he emerged from the ape till he discovered how to cook his vegetable food,
obtained practically all his starch in such a form. If it is given as liquid or pap it will
pass down as starch into the stomach, to setup disturbance in that organ; while if it is administered
in a form which obliges the child to chew it properly, not only will the jaws, the teeth, and
the gums obtain the exercise which they crave, and without which they cannot develop normally,
but the starch will be thoroughly insalivated that much of it will be converted within the
mouth into maltose. Hard well baked crusts constitute a convenient form in which to administer
starch to children. A piece of crust may be put in the oven and rebaked, and spread with butter.
Later, we may give hard plain biscuits." Dr. Campbell continues, that he does not say that
starch in the pappy form, or as porridge, should find no place whatever in man's dietary at
the present day, but we should arrange that a large proportion of our food is in a form inviting
mastication.

The teeth perform the very important function of breaking down our food and enabling it to
be intimately incorporated with the saliva and afterwards with the digestive juices. The Anglo-Saxon
race shows a greater tendency to degeneracy in the teeth than do other races; the teeth of
the present generation are less perfect than those of previous generations. A dentist writes
(Lancet, 1903-2, p. 1054) "I have had the opportunity of examining the teeth of many natives
in their more or less uncivilised state, from the Red Indians of North America, the negroes
of Africa, to the more civilised Chinese, Japanese, and Indians of the East, and I have usually
found them possessed of sound teeth, but so soon as they come under the influence of civilised
life in Washington, Montreal, London, Paris and other cities, their teeth begin to degenerate,
though their general health may remain good." In a long article on mastication in the Lancet
(1903-2, p. 84) from which we have already quoted, Dr. Harry Campbell gives as the effect of
thorough and efficient mastication, that it increases the amount of alkaline saliva passing
into the stomach, and prolongs the period of starch digestion within that organ. That it influences
the stomach reflexly by promoting the flow of gastric juice. That the frequent use of the jaws
and the tongue, during the period of growth, cause the jaws to expand. If the jaws are not
adequately exercised during this period, owing to the use of soft food, they do not reach their
normal size, the teeth are overcrowded, do not develop fully, and are prone to decay. The effect
of vigorous mastication is to stimulate the circulation in the tooth pulp, which promotes nutrition
and maintains a firm dental setting. Dr. Campbell writes: "I am perfectly at one with Dr. Wallace,
in believing that the removal of the fibrous portion of food is the main cause of the prevalence
of caries among moderns."

When the food reaches the stomach, gastric juice is secreted. This juice contains a ferment
called pepsin and hydrochloric acid. Pepsin is only active in an acid media. Starch digestion
proceeds in the stomach to such a time--stated as from 15 to 30 minutes--when the acid gastric
juice has been poured out in sufficient quantity to neutralise the alkalinity of the saliva.
The gastric juice acts upon the proteids only. After a time the liquefied contents of the stomach
are passed into the first portion of the small intestine, called the duodenum. Here it meets
with the pancreatic juice, which like the gastric juice attacks proteids, but even more energetically,
and only in an alkaline media. The proteolitic ferment is called trypsin. The pancreatic, the
most important of the digestive fluids, contains other ferments; one called amylopsin, takes
up the digestion of any remaining or imperfectly converted starch left from the salivary digestion.
Amylopsin is much more powerful and rapid than the ptyalin of the saliva, especially on uncooked
starch. Its absence from the pancreatic juice of infants is an indication that starch should
not be given them. Another ferment, stearopsin, emulsifies fats. The bile is alkaline and assists
the pancreatic juice in neutralising the acid mixture that leaves the stomach; it also assists
the absorption of fats. The digestion of proteids is not completed in the stomach. There are
some who look upon the stomach as chiefly of use as a receptacle for the large mass of food,
which is too quickly eaten to be passed at once into the intestines; the food being gradually
expelled from the stomach, in such quantities as the duodenal digestion can adequately treat.
A frequently used table, showing the time required for the digestion of various foods in the
stomach, is of little practical value. There is ample provision for the digestion of food,
there is a duplication of ferments for the proteids and starch. In health, the ferments are
not only very active, but are secreted in ample quantities. The digestive or unorganised ferments
must not be confused with the organised ferments such as yeast. The latter are living vegetable
cells, capable of indefinite multiplication. The former are soluble bodies, and though capable
of transforming or digesting some thousands of times their mass of food, their power in this
direction is restricted within definite limits. Another and preferable name for them is enzymes.

The action of saliva on starch is powerfully retarded by tea, this is due to the tannin. Coffee
and cocoa are without effect. Tea infused for two minutes only, was not found to have sensibly
less restraining effect than when infused for thirty minutes. On peptic digestion both tea
and coffee had a powerful retarding effect. When of equal strength cocoa was nearly as bad,
but as it is usually taken much weaker, its inhibitory effect is of little consequence.

Bacteria are minute vegetable organisms, which exist in the dust of the air, in water and almost
everywhere on or near the surface of the earth. They are consequently taken in with our food.
They exist in the mouth; those in carious teeth are often sufficient to injuriously affect
digestion and health. The healthy gastric juice is to a great degree antiseptic, but few bacteria
being able to endure its acidity. When the residue of the food reaches the large intestine,
bacteria are found in very great numbers. The warmth of the body is highly favourable to their
growth. They cause the food and intestinal debris to assume its fæcal character. Should the
mass be retained, the bacterial poisons accumutate and being absorbed into the body produce
headaches, exhaustion, neurasthenia and other complaints. Proteid matter, the products of its
decomposition and nitrogenous matter generally, are especially the food of bacteria; this is
shown in the offensiveness of the fæces of the carnivora, notwithstanding their short intestines,
compared with that of the herbivora. Also in the difference of the fæces of the dog when fed
on flesh and on a nearly vegetable diet. On a rich proteid diet, especially if it consists
largely of flesh, the bacterial products in the intestines are greater than on a vegetable
diet. On the latter such a disease as appendicitis is rare. Professor Elie Metchnikoff, of
the Pasteur Institute, thinks that man's voluminous and highly developed large intestine fulfils
no useful purpose, and on account of its breeding a very copious and varied bacterial flora,
could with advantage be dispensed with. He also has said that man, who could support himself
on food easily digestible, has a small intestine which is disproportionately fully developed.
Instead of having between 18 and 21 feet of small intestine, man might do with one-third of
that length. According to him, there is a disharmony of our food and our digestive system.
Referring to such views, and the desire of some surgeons to remove the vermiform appendix and
portions of the intestines upon too little provocation, Sir W. Macewin, M.D., F.R.S. (B. Medical
Jrn., 1904, 2 p. 874) says:--"Is this human body of ours so badly constructed that it contains
so many useless parts and requires so much tinkering? Possibly I may be out of fashion with
the times, as I cannot find such imperfections in the normal human body as are alleged. On
the contrary, the more one looks into the human body and sees it work, the better one understands
it and the more one is struck with the wondrous utility, beauty, and harmony of all its parts."
Our food we can change, but not our organs-except by a dangerous surgical operations. Our teeth
with our complex and very long intestines are adapted for fibrous, bulky and solid food. On
such food mankind has lived for an immense period of time. It is true that there are several
theoretical advantages in cooked vegetable foods; but unfortunately there is a want of conformity
with our digestive organs. If a flesh diet is taken, the incongruity is greater. Concentrated
food causes constipation. An active man, leading an out-of-door life, can take unsuitable food
with little or no apparent inconvenience, the movements of his body favouring intestinal action;
whilst the same food to a sedentary person will prove distinctly injurious.

Some persons have such a vigorous digestion that they can consume almost any food, even that
which is obviously unsuitable; not only bad in kind but excessive in quantity. Other persons
have to be very careful. Many have boasted that they can take of what they call the good things
of life to their full, without bad effect. We know of such men who have been much esteemed
for their joviality and good nature, but who have broken down in what should have been a hearty
and useful middle life. There are others who were poorly equipped for the battle of life, with
indifferent constitutions, never having had the buoyancy and overflowing of animal spirits;
but who, by conserving such strength as they had, have outlived all their more healthy but
less careful comrades. The errors of the parents are often most evident in the children or
grandchildren. There are many persons who cannot eat of some particular food, although it may
be quite wholesome to others. Sometimes it is a psychological rather than a physiological disability,
which may he overcome by an effort of the will. At other times it seems to have no connection
with the imagination, although it is not always possible to give a sound reason for it. In
the main, of course, there are principles of dietetics applicable to all alike, but in regard
to details, everyone should make rules for himself, according to his experience. When there
appears no real reason for an idiosyncrasy, a little humouring of our taste and digestion will
often overcome it, to our advantage. It is generally those of delicate constitution who are
most sensitive. Some cannot eat oatmeal except in small quantity. Olive and other vegetable
oils, even when of good quality cannot be taken by many people, whilst others find them quite
as wholesome, or even better than butter. Vegetarians can generally detect lard in pastry both
by its taste and its after effects, although those accustomed to this fat do not object to
it. It is also surprising how some individual's tastes and habits will vary at different periods
of their lives.

One form of dyspepsia is due to undigested starch remaining in the stomach and causing an excessive
secretion of hydrochloric acid. As long as proteid food is present, the pepsin and acid expend
themselves on it, and are removed together. The undigested starch continues to stimulate gastric
secretion, and the acid residuum causes pain, heartburn and flatulence. If there be also any
butyric acid, or some other fatty acid, derived from milk, butter, cheese, &c., there will
be acid eructations. For this form of indigestion there are several methods of treatment. First;
the very thorough cooking of all starchy food, and it is an advantage to take a little good
extract of malt, either at the time of eating or directly afterwards. The diastase of the malt
has the same action on starch as the ptyalin in the saliva. It is better, scientifically, to
have the farinaceous food at about 130° F. (as hot as the mouth can bear will do), and then
to add malt extract. On keeping the mixture warm, from a few minutes to half an hour or more,
the starch is digested and rendered soluble. Such food is not very pleasant to take. The food
known as Grape Nuts has been treated in a similar manner. The use of malt extract, however,
seems a clumsy substitute for salivary digestion. Second; the eating of starch in the form
of hard and dry biscuits, crusts and other hard food, which demand thorough mastication and
insalivation, and the keeping in the mouth for a long while, during which the saliva has time
to act. This is the best plan. Third; the taking of sodium bicarbonate towards the end of the
period of digestion, in order to neutralise the acid in the stomach. This gives relief, but
does not cure, as the dose has to be repeated after each meal; in course of time the quantity
of soda has sometimes to be increased to an alarming extent. Fourth; the abstention from starchy
foods and the substitution of an exclusive flesh dietary. In the "Salisbury" treatment, raw
minced beef is given. This method often gives immediate relief, but its ultimate effect on
the kidneys and other organs is very bad.

No hard and fast rule can be laid down as to the number of meals into which the daily amount
of food required should be divided. The stomach appears to work to the best advantage when
it is full, or nearly so, and the appetite is appeased. Three approximately equal meals seems
to be a convenient division. Dr. Dewey and his followers advise only two meals a day, and it
seems incontestable that many persons find the plan advantageous. These are generally adults
with weak digestions, or elderly persons who, on account of their age and the sluggish action
of their assimilative functions, require comparatively little food. Children, on account of
their vigorous vitality, rapid growth and hearty appetites, ought not to be restricted to this
number. Persons who have got into the pernicious habit of greatly over-eating, and whose stomachs
have become distended and unusually large, sometimes find it easier to restrict their daily
food to a healthy quantity by taking only two meals. The general objections against two meals
are that either two little food is taken, or the ingestion of such a large quantity is bad
for the stomach and causes it to press on the adjacent viscera. The large quantity of blood
and nerve force drawn to the over-distended stomach, depletes the brain and nervous system,
causing drowsiness and incapacity for mental and physical work. The carnivora, whose opportunity
for obtaining food--unlike the herbivora--is irregular and often at long intervals, gorge themselves
upon opportunity and are in the habit of sleeping after a meal. The frugivora and herbivora,
however, are alert and ready to fly from their enemies should such appear. The conveying of
so much nourishment to the liver and blood stream at one time, is probably a greater tax on
them. A light lunch between the usual full meals has nothing to recommend it. The stomach is
burdened to little purpose, often before it has finished with one meal another is imposed upon
it, no time being left for recuperation.

Dietaries.--The best proportions of proteids, carbo-hydrates and fats required for the nourishment
of the body has not yet been conclusively decided. The common plan is to average the dietary
of large bodies of persons, particualrly of soldiers and prisoners. These dietaries have been
adjusted empirically (the earlier ones at least), and are generally considered as satisfactory.
They are chiefly of English and German origin. Another method is to laboriously analyse the
injesta or food consumed and compare it with the dejecta or excretions, until a quantity and
kind of food is found which is just sufficient to keep the body in equilibrium. This latter
plan is the best, but to be quite satisfactory must be tried on a large number of suitable
persons under varying conditions, both of quantity and kind of food. Nearly all the experiments
have been made on persons accustomed to a stimulating dietary: their usual food has included
a considerable quantity of flesh and alcoholic drinks. Sufficient attention has not been paid
to the dietaries of the more abstemious races who partake of little if any flesh food. The
standard daily dietary for a man of average weight, doing a moderate amount of work, is variously
stated by the best authorities as proteids from 100 to 130 grammes, fat 35 to 125 grammes,
and carbo-hydrates 450 to 550 grammes. There is a surprising difference of opinion on the amount
of fat, but those who give least fat give the largest quantity of carbo-hydrate and vice-versa.
Dr. R. Hutchison in "Food and Dietetics," sums up the quantities given by the highest authorities
as follows:---

Proteid       125 g. ( 4.4 oz.) x 4.1 =  512 cal. = 20 g. N,  62 C
Carbo-hydrate 500 g. (17.6 oz.)   4.1   2050                 200
Fat            50 g. ( 1.8 oz.)   9.3    465                  38
              -----------------         ----        -------- -----
               675 g.(23.8    )         3027 Total  20 g. N, 300 C

The nutrient ratio is 1 : 4.9. For scientific purposes, metrical weights and measures are used,
instead of the inconvenient English grains, ounces, pounds, &c. (1 gramme = 15.43 grains; 1
ounce avoirdupois = 437.5 grains = 28.35 grammes). A calorie is a measure of the power of a
food in generating heat and muscular energy (these two being convertible).

The calories used in food tables are kilo-calories, representing the amount of heat which would
raise a kilogramme (1000 grammes) of water 1° Centigrade. This is the same as raising 1 pound
weight 4° Fahrenheit. According to the table given, 125 grammes of dry proteid are required
per day; this contains 20 grammes of nitrogen and 62 of carbon. When thoroughly consumed or
utilised in the body, the heat or its equivalent in muscular work equals 512 kilo-calories.
Proteids have, of course, an additional value as tissue formers. The factors used here, of
4.1 and 9.3, are those commonly employed; but the latest and most reliable research, taking
account only of that part of the food which is actually available in the body, gives for proteid
and carbo-hydrate 4 calories, and for fat 8.9 calories.

Fat has a higher food value than the carbo-hydrates, as 4.1 : 9.3 = 2.27 or 4.0 : 89 = 2.225,
according to whether the old or new factors are used. In the table of analyses 2.225 was used.
The standard dietary for a woman, or of a boy 14 to 16 years of age, is given as equivalent
to eight-tenths that of a man; a child of 10 to 13 six-tenths; of 2 to 5 four-tenths. A man
doing hard work requires one-tenth more. The following table gives three standard dietaries,
and a few actual ones, in grammes per day. The food of persons in easy circumstances, and of
working men in the receipt of good wages, approximate to the standard dietaries, except that
the fat is higher and the carbo-hydrates proportionately less. This is due to an abundance
of animal food. It was thought unnecessary to give them in detail:--

Dr. Alexander Haig considers that 88 grammes of proteid is required by a man leading a decidedly
active life.

NOTES.--(a) The Japanese are of small stature and weight.

(b) One of a series of experiments by A.W. Blyth, 1888. 1-1/2 lbs. of wheatmeal per day was
required for equilibrium; sedentary occupation, with a daily walk of six miles.

(c) See "A Text Book of Physiology," by M. Foster, 5th edition, part ii., p. 839; the diet
was bread, fruit and oil. The man was in apparently good health and stationary weight; only
59 per cent. of the proteids were digested, leaving the small quantity of 32 grammes available
for real use. In commenting upon this, Professor Foster writes:--"We cannot authoritatively
say that such a reduction is necessarily an evil; for our knowledge will not at present permit
us to make an authoritative exact statement as to the extent to which the proteid may be reduced
without disadvantage to the body, when accompanied by adequate provision of the other elements
of food; and this statement holds good whether the body be undertaking a small or large amount
of labour."

(d) The Miller of Billericay's case is quoted by Dr. Carpenter, and also by Dr. Pavy. It was
reported to the College of Physicians in 1767 by Sir George Baker. A remarkable degree of vigour
is said to have been sustained for upwards of eighteen years on no other nutriment than 16
oz. of flour, made into a pudding with water, no other liquid of any kind being taken.

A striking instance of abstemiousness is that of Cornaro, a Venetian nobleman, who died in
the year 1566 at the age of 98. Up to the age of 40 he spent a life of indulgence, eating and
drinking to excess. At this time, having been endowed with a feeble constitution, he was suffering
from dyspepsia, gout, and an almost continual slow fever, with an intolerable thirst continually
hanging upon him. The skill of the best physicians of Italy was unavailing. At length he completely
changed his habits of diet, and made a complete recovery. At the age of 83 he wrote a treatise
on a "Sure and certain method of attaining a long and healthful life." He says, what with bread,
meat, the yolk of an egg and soup, I ate as much as weighed 12 ozs., neither more nor less.
I drank 14 oz. of wine. When 78 he was persuaded to increase his food by the addition of 2
oz. per day, and this nearly proved fatal. He writes that, instead of old age being one of
weakness, infirmity and misery, I find myself to be in the most pleasant and delightful stage
of life. At 83 I am always merry, maintaining a happy peace in my own mind. A sober life has
preserved me in that sprightliness of thought and gaiety of humour. My teeth are all as sound
as in my youth. He was able to take moderate exercise in riding and walking at that age. He
was very passionate and hasty in his youth. He wrote other treatises up to the age of 95.

Kumagara, Lapicque and Breis-acher, have, as the result of their experiments, reduced the quantity
of proteid required per 24 hours to 45 grammes. T. Hirschfeld states, as the conclusion of
his research, that it is possible for a healthy man (in one case for 15 days and in another
for 10 days) to maintain nitrogenous balance on from 30 to 40 grammes of proteid per day. Labbé
and Morchoisne (Comptes Rendus, 30th May, 1904, p. 1365) made a dieting experiment during 38
days, upon one of themselves. The proteid was derived exclusively from vegetable food. The
food consisted of bread, lentils, haricots, potatoes, carrots, chestnuts, endives, apples,
oranges, preserves, sugar, starch, butter, chocolate and wine. At the commencement, the day's
food contained 14.1 grammes of nitrogen = 89.3 proteid, which was gradually diminished. On
the 7th day 11.6 g. N. = 73.5 g. proteid was reached; during this time less N. was eliminated,
indicating that the proteid food was in excess of that required for the wear and tear of the
body. As the quantity of nitrogenous food was diminished almost daily, the N. eliminated was
found to diminish also. This latter was in slight excess of that absorbed; but when a day or
two's time was allowed, without further reduction in the food, the body tended to adjust itself
to the dimished supply, and there was an approximation of income and expenditure. The smallest
quantity of food was reached on the 32nd day with 1.06 N. = 6.7 proteid, which was obviously
too little, as 2.19 N. = 13.9 proteid was eliminated. On the 21st day 4.12 N. = 26 proteid
was injested, and 4.05 N. was eliminated. The inference drawn from the research is that about
26 grammes of proteid per day was sufficient. Emily said, "I have heard many different things about
him; however, most people trust Mrs. Dalton's beliefs more then they
do yours, Lady Margaret, myself included." Of course the full amount of calories
was kept up; as each succeeding quantity of the proteid was left off, it was replaced by a
proper quantity of non-nitrogenous food. These experiments were carried out in the usual approved
scientific manner. It may, however, be urged against any generalised and positive conclusions
as to the minimum quantity of proteid required for the body, being drawn from such experiments,
that the period covered by them was much too short. A prolonged trial might have revealed some
obscure physiological derangement. We are quite justified in concluding that the usual, so-called
"standard dietaries" contain an unnecessarily large proportion of proteid. In some practical
dietaries, 50 grammes and under have seemed enough; but for the ordinary adult man, who has
been accustomed to an abundance of proteid, and whose ancestors have also, it is probably advisable
not to take less than 70 or 80 grammes per day (2-1/2 to 3 ounces). If it is desired to try
less, the diminution should be very gradual, and a watch should be kept for any lessening of
strength.

Some comments may now be made upon the table of dietaries. That of the London sewing girl contained
53 grammes of proteid, which should have been ample, according to some of the authorities we
have given; yet she was badly nourished. The food was doubtless of bad quality, and it appears
deficient in carbo-hydrates; this latter is shown by the low number of calories. The long hours
and unhealthy conditions of work, and not a deficiency of food constituents, is probably the
cause of the bad health of such persons. There is no reason to think the proteid insufficient,
although some persons have said as much. We have no particulars of the German vegetarians,
but the calories appear satisfactory. In the poor German labourer's family the calories are
too low. In Dr. T.R. Allinson's experiment on a wheatmeal dietary, it will not do to assume
that less than 82 grammes of proteid would have been insufficient. It is probable that a smaller
quantity of proteid would have been enough if the fat and carbohydrates had been increased.
The calories are below the usual standard. In the succeeding example the calories are considerably
higher, being not far from the usual standard, yet 54 grammes of proteid sufficed. It is a
common error to place an undue value on the proteids to the extent of overlooking the other
constituents. Dr. Alexander Haig in "Diet and Food," p. 8, cites the case of a boy aged 10,
fed on 2-1/4 pints of milk per day. The boy lost weight, and Dr. Haig is of opinion that the
quantity of milk was very deficient in proteid; more than twice as much being required. 2-1/4
pints of milk contain about 45 grammes of proteid, whereas, according to the usual figures
(125 x 6/10) a boy of this age requires 75 g. This quantity of 45 g. is however, higher, allowing
for the boy's age, than that in several of the dietaries we have given in our table. A little
consideration will show that Dr. Haig has overlooked the serious deficiency of the milk in
the other constituents, which accounts for the boy's loss of weight. The quantity of milk contains
only about 160 g. of total solid matter, whilst 400 g. is the necessary quantity. Milk is too
rich in proteid matter to form, with advantage, the sole food of a human being. Human milk
contains much less in proportion to the other constituents.

The old doctrine enunciated by Justus von Liebig was that proteid matter is the principal source
of muscular energy or strength. He afterwards discovered and acknowledged his error, and the
subject has since been thoroughly investigated. The makers of meat extracts and other foods,
either from their own ignorance of modern research or their wish to take advantage of the lack
of knowledge and prejudice of the public, call proteid matter alone nourishment. The carbo-hydrates
and fats are equally entitled to be called nourishment.

Our reason for devoting so much space to the consideration of the quantity of proteid matter
required, is that in the opinion of many eminent writers it is the crux of vegetarianism. They
have stated that it is impossible to obtain sufficient from vegetable foods alone, without
consuming an excessive quantity of carbo-hydrates. We will summarise the argument as given
in Kirke's Physiology, as edited by Morrant Baker, a standard work, and which is repeated in
Furneaux's "Animal Physiology," a book which is much used in elementary science schools: "The
daily waste from the system amounts to, carbon 4,500 grains (or 300 grammes), and nitrogen,
300 grains (or 20 grammes). Now let us suppose a person to feed on bread only. In order to
obtain the necessary quantity of nitrogen to repair this waste he would have to eat nearly
4-1/4 lbs. daily.... He would be compelled to take about double the quantity of carbon required
in order to obtain the necessary weight of nitrogen.... Next, let us suppose that he feeds
on lean meat only. Then, in order to obtain the necessary quantity of carbon, he must eat no
less than 6-1/2 lbs. daily.... In this case we notice a similar waste of nitrogen, the removal
of which would give an undue amount of work to the organs concerned.... But it is possible
to take such a mixed diet of bread and meat as will supply all the requirements of the system,
and at the same time yield but little waste material." (These extracts are from Furneaux, the
next is from Kirke. The figures and argument is the same in each, but we have chosen those
sentences for quotation which are the briefest and most suitable; certain calculations being
omitted.) "A combination of bread and meat would supply much more economically what was necessary
... so that 3/4 lbs. of meat, and less than 2 lbs. of bread would supply all the needful carbon
and nitrogen with but little waste. From these facts it will be plain that a mixed diet is
the best and most economical food for man; and the result of experience entirely coincides
with what might have been anticipated on theoretical grounds only." Professor Huxley, in his
"Elementary Physiology" uses almost the same figures and argument.

The adoption of this high proteid or nitrogen figure would lead to some ridiculous conclusions.
One writer states that 18 eggs would contain sufficient flesh forming substance for a day's
ration, but a very much larger quantity would be required to supply enough carbon. On the other
hand, Professor Church says that, no less than 70 lbs. of pears would have to be eaten per
day, to supply the necessary quantity of nitrogen; although the carbon would be in excess.
The curious may calculate the proper quantity of each that would make a theoretically perfect
dietary. People are apt to assume that what they themselves eat, or what their class, race,
or nation eat, is the proper and necessary diet; at least as far as the elementary constituents
and quantities are concerned. The error is in attempting to make a vegetarian diet, however
contrary to common sense and the experience of the greater part of the earth's inhabitants,
agree in composition with the ordinary lavish flesh dietary of the well-to-do European. It
is significant that John Bull is caricatured with a large abdomen and a coarse, ruddy, if not
inflamed face, indicative of his hearty dining on flesh, coarse food and alcoholic drinks.
An unhealthy short lived individual. Even if we accept a high proportion of proteid, it is
possible to combine purely vegetable foods so as to give the required quantity of the various
constituents, without a superfluity of the carbo-hydrates. In "Food Grains of India," Professor
A.H. Church shows by elaborate analyses and dietary tables, how this can be accomplished by
various combinations of cereals, pulses, etc. He takes Forster and Voit's standard of 282 grains
of nitrogen and 5,060 grains of carbon, with a suitable deduction for the smaller weight of
the Indians. In his examples of daily rations he gives from 5 to 9 ounces of various beans,
balanced by the addition of the proper quantity of rice--4 to 16 ounces, and a little oil.
Such a large quantity of pulse appears to us excessive, and would cause discomfort to most
persons. We much doubt whether those Indians who are strict vegetarians could consume such
quantities.

Some valuable investigations were made on the diet of a family of fruitarians, at the Californian
Agricultural Experimental Station, July, 1900, by Professor M.E. Jaffa (bulletin 107). The
proportion of food, both proteid and carbo-hydrate used was surprisingly small. The research
is particularly important, as the diet was not an experimental one, tried during a short period
only; but that to which the family were accustomed. The family consisted of two women and three
children; they had all been fruitarians for five to seven years, and made no change in their
dietary during the experiment. They only had two meals a day, the food being eaten uncooked.
The quantities of all the foods and other particulars are detailed in the bulletin. The first
meal was at 10-30 a.m., and always consisted of nuts followed by fruits. The other meal was
about 5 p.m., when they usually ate no nuts, substituting olive oil and honey. The nuts used
were almonds, Brazil, pine, pignolias and walnuts; the fresh fruits were apples, apricots,
bananas, figs, grapes, oranges, peaches and pears. Other foods were dates, raisins, pickled
olives, olive oil and honey. One person (b) ate a little celery and tomatoes, and another (c)
a little cereal food. According to a source I can't remember, his idea of "Natural Theology"
simply translated an early Dutch work. The archdeacon probably would have shielded him and
his work from criticism, despite its clear plagiarism, simply as a matter of convenience for
himself.

The last research extended over ten days; the period during which each of the other subjects
was under observation was from 20 to 28 days.

(a) The tentative standard for a woman at light work calls for 90 grammes of proteids and 2,500
calories; it is thus seen that the quantity of food eaten was far below that usually stated
as being necessary. The subject, however, was a very small woman, 5 feet in height, taking
almost no physical exercise. She believed, as do fruitarians generally, that people need far
less raw than cooked food. (b) The food eaten was even less in quantity than in the previous
dietary. One reason for this was the fact that the subject was, for part of the time at least,
under great mental strain, and did not have her usual appetite. Even this small amount of food,
judging by her appearance and manner, seemed sufficient for her needs, enabling her to do her
customary housework and take care of her two nieces and nephew, the subjects of the other experiments.
(c) This girl was given cereals and vegetables when she craved them, but her aunt says she
never looks nor feels so well when she has much starchy food, and returns to her next meal
of uncooked food with an increased appreciation of its superiority. The commonly accepted dietary
standard for a child 13 years old and of average activity, is not far from 90 grammes of proteids
and 2,450 calories, yet the girl had all the appearance of being well fed and in excellent
health and spirits. Three of the tribes around that area are Mahri, Salbani, and Gohi.
I will tell you about a man named Talib. He had asked to leave so he could go to Sufeila, insisting
he would not be away long. He was interested in arraging a meeting
of some kind with shikh. Febrary the 23rd we arrived at Rahba.
She was very small for her age, being 10 pounds under the average weight, and 7 inches less
than the average height. It is interesting to note that her only gain in weight during the
past year was made during this dietary and the one immediately following. This was due to her
being urged to eat all she wanted, of what she most preferred, as the food was provided by
those making the study. The proteid is less than the tentative standard for a child of 1 to
2 years old, but the subject appeared perfectly well and was exceedingly active. She impressed
one as being a healthy child, but looked younger than her age. (ee) The subject is the same
as in the previous experiment (e), but after an interval of 8 months, her seventh birthday
occurred during the time.

Professor Jaffa, who made the investigation, says:--"It would appear that all the subjects
were decidedly under-nourished, even making allowance for their light weight. But when we consider
that the two adults have lived upon this diet for seven years, and think they are in better
health and capable of more work than they ever were before, we hesitate to pronounce judgment.
The three children had the appearance of health and strength. They ran and jumped and played
all day like ordinary healthy children, and were said to be unusually free from colds and other
complaints common to childhood. The youngest child, and the only one who has lived as a fruitarian
almost from infancy was certainly undeveloped. She looked fully two years younger than she
was. Still, there are so many children who are below the average in development, whose dietaries
conform to the ordinary standards, that it would be unfair to draw any conclusions until many
more such investigations are made."

The research shows that not only is there need of a revision of the "standard" quantity of
proteids, but also of the carbo-hydrates and fats. It is generally said by those who have no
practical experience amongst vegetarians, that the latter require a much larger quantity of
food than do those who include flesh. The truth is that vegetarians eat less, often much less.
It is a common experience that vegetable food has a more staying power, and a much longer period
can be allowed between meals, without the inconvenience that a flesh-eater, especially a flesh
and alcohol consumer, suffers. This is due, in part at least, to its less stimulating character
and its slower digestion. This fact has been shown by the success of vegetarians in feats of
strength and endurance, and especially in the comparatively fresh condition in which they have
finished long walking, cycling, tennis, and other matches. Those who attempt to prolong their
powers of endurance by flesh extracts and stimulating foods and drinks, usually finish in a
very exhausted condition. The superior endurance and recovery from wounds, when compared with
our English soldiers, of simple feeding men, such as the Zulus, Turks and Japanese, has often
been remarked. It is often said that vegetable food, as it contains more fibre and is slower
of digestion, taxes the bodily organs more. If we attempted to eat uncooked, the more fibrous
vegetables, the grains, and unripe fruit, it would be quite true, but it is not so of the ordinary
food of vegetarians. A slowness of digestion does not necessarily imply a greater strain on
the system. As vegetables, in particular, are for the longest period of time in the intestines,
and undergo the greater part of their digestion there, a gentle and slow process of digestion
in that organ may be more thorough. It may also entail less expenditure of nervous energy than
if the food had been of such a stimulating character, as to be hurried along the digestive
tract. Digestion is for the most part a chemical process. If the food is of right kind and
quantity, thoroughly masticated, assisted if necessary by cookery, and the digestive ferments
are normal, digestion proceeds without any sensible expenditure or energy or consciousness
of its accomplishment. There is nothing improbable in a flesh-eater requiring more food than
a simple living vegetarian. His food contains more proteid, and excrementitious matter or extractives;
these stimulate the digestive organs and overtax the excretory ones. Generally, he is fond
of condiments, salt, and elaborate cooking, often also of alcohol; if a man, probably of tobacco.
He lives, as it were, at high pressure.

There are on record certain experiments which appear to indicate the necessity of a large proportion
of proteid, especially when the diet has been of vegetable origin. These experiments are inconclusive,
because the subject has been accustomed to an ordinary flesh diet, perhaps also to alcoholic
drinks. The change to a comparatively non-stimulating diet cannot be made, and the digestive
organs expected to adapt themselves in a few days. Perhaps not even a month or a year would
suffice, for some people, and yet that same diet would suit others. In some experiments the
food has not been appetising, the subject has even taken it with reluctance or even loathing;
an excess of some food has been eaten which no vegetarian or anybody else would think of using
in a practical dietary.

Sometimes persons on changing from an ordinary flesh dietary, lose weight and strength. Generally,
it is found that they have done little more than discontinue the flesh, without substituting
suitable foods. Authorities think it is from a deficiency of proteid, and recommend an addition
of such foods as pulse, wheatmeal, oatmeal, eggs, milk, cheese, and such as a reference to
the table of analyses, show a low nutrient ratio figure. This may also be due to an insufficiency
of food eaten, owing to the comparatively insipid character of the food and want of appetite.
In making a change to a vegetarian diet, such foods had better be taken that are rather rich
in proteid, and that approximate somewhat in their flavour and manner of cooking to that used
previously. A further change to a simpler diet can afterwards gradually be made, according
to conviction, tastes and bodily adaptability. It must not be expected that a change, even
an ultimately very advantageous one, will always meet with an immediate and proper response
from digestive and assimilative organs which have been accustomed for many years, perhaps by
inheritance for generations, to another manner of living. There are several preparations produced
from centrifugalised milk--that is milk from which the butter fat has been removed, which consist
chiefly of proteid. These have a value in increasing the proteid contents of foods which may
be thought deficient. The addition of these manufactured products appear unnecessary, as most
of our food contains an abundance of proteid, and we can easily limit the quantity or avoid
altogether those that are thought defective.

The later apologists for a flesh diet have had to admit that it is not a physiological necessity;
but they have attempted to justify its use by a theory somewhat as follows. It is admitted,
that any excess of proteid over that necessary for its special province of producing tissue,
is utilised as a force-producer, in a similar manner to the carbo-hydrates. When the molecule
is split up, and the carbon utilised, the nitrogen passes off in the form of urea by the kidneys.
The theory propounded is that at the moment the nitrogen portion is liberated, it in some manner
stimulates the living protoplasm of the nerve cells in its immediate neighbourhood to a higher
state of activity. These views are given by Dr. Hutchison in his book on "Food," but there
are no substantial grounds for them. It is only prompted by a wish to excuse a cherished habit.
Sir William Roberts, M.D., in "Dietetics and Dyspepsia," p. 16 says that "high feeding consists
mainly in a liberal allowance of meat, and in the systematic use of alcoholic beverages, and
that low-feeding consists in a diet which is mainly vegetarian and non-alcoholic," and he proceeds
to say that the high-fed classes and races display, on the whole, a richer vitality and a greater
brain-power than their low-fed brethren. That "it is remarkable how often we hear of eminent
men being troubled with gout, and gout is usually produced either by personal or ancestral
high-feeding." We can only spare room for a few remarks on this subject. Intellectual and business
ability brings wealth, wealth frequently leads to the pleasures of the table, but such habits
are detrimental to sustained effort and clearness of mind. The children and grandchildren of
such high livers are usually common-place, intellectually, and of deteriorated physique. The
aristocracy who are generally high livers, notwithstanding their great advantages of education,
travel and leisure, are not as a rule famed for their intellectual gifts. In the recent war
the frugal living Japanese soldier has proved himself the most enduring and bravest in history;
whilst the Japanese officers are more resourceful and tactful than the wealthier, high-fed
Russian officers, with their aristocratic lineage. What is called high-feeding, is of the greatest
benefit to the doctors and the proprietors of remedies for digestive and nervous disorders.

Food Adjuncts and Drugs.--In addition to the nutrients and the small quantity of indigestible
fibre of which we have already written, food generally contains small quantities of substances
which are difficult to classify, and whose action on the body is but imperfectly understood.
Many of these possess pungent or strong odours and flavours. To them, various fruits, meats,
etc., owe much of their characteristic differences of taste. When pure the proteids and starches
are devoid of taste. Such oils and fats as are generally eaten have also but little flavour,
providing they are free from rancidity and of good quality. The sugars differ from the other
nutrients in possessing a more or less decided taste. The free vegetable acids also strongly
affect the sense of taste, but they are only consumed in small quantities.

A drug may be defined as a substance which modifies the functions of the body or of some organ
without sensibly imparting nourishment. This action may be one of stimulation or of depression.
A drug is taken for its medicinal action, a food adjunct for its modifying action on food.
It is impossible to give a quite satisfactory definition, or to draw sharp distinctions. For
example, tea, coffee, alcohol and tobacco are sometimes placed in one group, and sometimes
in another, according to opinion of their action and the definition of the terms food adjuncts,
drugs and poisons. The difference of grouping often depends upon intensity rather than of kind
of action. If taken frequently and not in quantity sufficient to have a markedly medicinal
action, such things are generally called food adjuncts or supplementary foods, although much
may be said in favour of a different view. The volatile oils of mustard, caraway, cloves, etc.,
are used in medicine; also the alkaloids of coffee and cocoa. Even honey is used as a mild
laxative for infants; that is, as a drug. The difference between a drug and a poison is one
only of degree. Some of the most esteemed drugs have to be administered in very small quantities,
or they cause death; e.g., strychnine and morphine.

Classifications are necessary for methodical study, and for assisting the memory in grasping
large numbers of things which can be grouped together. Classifications, however, are artificial,
not due to natural lines of demarkation, but according to man's knowledge and convenience;
hence a group is apt to approach and finally merge into another group, although on first consideration
they appeared quite distinct. The disregard of this often leads to confusion and useless discussions.

Plants, like animals, as the result of tissue change, have certain used-up or waste matters
to get out of the way. Animals have special excretory organs for the purpose; waste matter
remains in the flesh and blood of dead animals. In plants are found a large number of powerful
volatile oils, alkaloids, bitter resins, etc. Many of these are, in all probability, excretory
products of no assimilative value to the plant. Certain volatile oils may attract insects,
and in obtaining nectar from flowers insects assist fertilisation. Agreeable volatile oils
and flavouring substances in fruits attract birds and animals. The eating of the fruits cause
the seeds, which are uninjured by passing through the digestive system, to be disseminated
over wide areas to the advantage of the plant species. On the other hand, nauseous and poisonous
alkaloids, oils, resins, etc., serve as a protection against the attacks of browsing animals,
birds, caterpillars, snails, etc. These nauseous substances are most abundant in the bark,
husk, skin and outer parts. It is commonly supposed that the food on which each animal, including
man, subsists, is especially produced by Nature for the purpose. This is an error, for each
species of plant and animal lives for itself alone, and protects itself, with more or less
success, against destruction by its competitors and enemies. Each species of animal selects
from its surroundings such food as is most suitable. Such food may not be theoretically perfect;
that is, it may not contain the maximum of nourishment free from innutritious matter; but during
the long period of evolution, each species of animal has become possessed of organs suited
to its environment. If to such animals be given food containing less indigestible matter, or
food which is more readily digested by laboratory tests made independently of the living animal,
their digestive system will be thrown out of gear, become clogged up or refuse to work properly,
just as the furnace of a steam boiler, made to burn coal, will act badly with wood or petroleum.
Many scientific men have overlooked this fact, and have endeavoured to produce food substances
for general consumption, in the most concentrated and soluble form, thinking such food would
be more easily assimilated.

The Volatile and Essential Oils are contained in minute quantity in a very large number of
animal and vegetable foods. They contribute in part to the flavour of fruits. They are the
cause of the pungency and aroma of mustard, horse-radish, cloves, nutmegs, cinnamon, caraway
seeds, mint, sage and other spices. Onions contain a notable quantity. When extracted the essential
oils become powerful drugs. In moderate quantities they are stomachic and carminative, in larger
quantities irritant and emetic. Condiments and spices not only add flavour to food, but stimulate
the secretion of gastric juice and peristaltic movement.

The Alkaloids most used are those of tea, coffee, kola-nut, cocoa, coca, tobacco and opium.
Although the two last are generally smoked, they must be classed amongst the food adjuncts.
It is of little consequence whether their active principles enter the body by the mouth and
saliva or the lungs; their action on the blood and nervous system is the same.

The Extractives, as they are called, comprise a number of bodies of varying nature. They especially
exist in flesh and flesh extracts. Amongst these are the purins. They will be treated at greater
length hereafter.

Alcohol is to some extent a true food, but its stimulant and other action quite overshadows
any food value it may possess.

There are other bodies such as the resins and bitters. The active principle of Indian hemp
is a resin.

There is a great difference of opinion as to the extent to which stimulants may advantageously
be used. It is remarkable that amongst nearly all nations, either alcohol in some form or one
of the stronger alkaloids is in common use. From this fact it is sometimes argued that stimulants
must supply a physiological need. The same method of reasoning will apply with greater force
to the use of condiments. Such conclusions appear to us to be scarcely warranted. If the extensive
or even universal practice of a thing proves its necessity, then has there been justification,
either now or in the past, for war, lying, avarice and other vices. It is strange that drugs
differing so greatly in their immediate and obvious effects as, for example, alcohol and opium,
or coffee and tobacco should be used. Should it he said that only some of the much used stimulants
are useful, there is an end to the argument based on their universal use. There is no doubt
that the use of stimulants in more than very small quantities is distinctly injurious, and
it is difficult to see what physiological advantage there can be in their habitual use, to
what is vaguely called a moderate extent. Sometimes they are taken for a supposed medical necessity,
and where taste attracts, little evidence satisfies. Those in the habit of taking them, if
honest, must confess that it is chiefly on account of the apparent enjoyment. The ill-nourished
and the depressed in body and mind crave most for stimulants. A food creates energy in the
body, including the nervous system, and this is the only legitimate form of stimulation. A
mere stimulant does not create but draws on the reserve forces. What was latent energy--to
become in the natural course gradually available--under stimulation is rapidly set free; there
is consequently, subsequent depletion of energy. There may occasionally be times when a particular
organ needs a temporary stimulus to increased action, notwithstanding it may suffer an after
depression; but such cases are so rare that they may be left out of our present argument, and
stimulants should only be used, like other powerful drugs, under medical advice. In the last
25 years the use of alcohol by the medical profession has steadily diminished, its poisonous
properties having become more evident.

There is a general similarity in the effects of stimulants on the digestive and nervous systems.
The most largely used stimulant is ethyl alcohol, and as its action is best known, it may be
useful to name the principal effects. Alcohol in the form of wine and spirits, in small quantities,
first stimulates the digestive organs. Large quantities inflame the stomach and stop digestion.
(Beer, however, retards digestion, altogether out of proportion to the alcohol it contains.)
Alcohol increases the action of the heart, increases the blood pressure, and causes the vessels
of the whole body to dilate, especially those of the skin; hence there is a feeling of warmth.
It the person previously felt cold he now feels warm. The result of the increased circulation
through the various organs is that they work with greater vigour, hence the mental faculties
are brightened for a time, and the muscular strength seems increased. The person usually feels
the better for it, though this is not always the case; some have a headache or feel very sleepy.
It has been repeatedly proved that these good results are but transitory. The heart, although
at first stimulated, is more exhausted after the action of the alcohol has passed away than
it was at first. This is true of all the organs of the body which were stimulated. In consequence
of the dilatation of the blood vessels of the skin, an unusual quantity of heat is lost and
the body is cooled. After taking alcohol persons are less able to stand cold. When overtaken
by snowstorms or subjected to excessive or prolonged cold, it has often happened that those
who resorted to spirit drinking have succumbed, whilst the others have survived. Insurance
statistics have conclusively shown that teetotallers are longer livers than the so-called moderate
drinkers. The terrible effects on both body and mind of the excessive drinking of alcohol,
or the use of other strong stimulants or narcotics, are too obvious to need allusion to here;
we are only concerned with what is vaguely called their moderate use.

The stimulation produced by tea and coffee is in some respects like that of alcohol. The heart
is stimulated and the blood pressure rises. The kidneys are strongly affected in those unaccustomed
to the drug, but this ceases after a week or more of use. Their chief effect is on the brain
and nervous system. Some of us have known of such men, who have been esteemed for their joviality
and good nature, who have suddenly broken down at what should have been a hearty middle life.
On the other hand there are men who were badly equipped for the battle of life, with indifferent
constitutions, who never had the buoyancy and overflow of animal spirits, but who with care
have long outlived all their formerly more robust but careless companions.

Simple versus Highly-flavoured Foods.--It is very difficult to decide to what extent condiments
and flavourings should be used. As a consequence of the defensive excise, Southern cultivators
were required to revolve more and more to Northern mills for their cloth, shoes, hats, hoes, plows,
and equipment. virtually all the goods which they purchased in Europe in substitute for their
construct came abroad to Northern harbors, whence transshipments were prepared by rail and
water to Southern points of division. Their rice, cotton, and tobacco, in as far as they were not
carried to Europe in British bottoms, were elated by Northern masters.

On the other hand there are races who enjoy stronger flavoured food, including such things
as garlic, curry, pickles, pepper, strong cheese, meat extracts, rancid fats, dried and smoked
fish, high game or still more decomposed flesh, offal and various disgusting things. The Greenlanders
will eat with the keenest appetite, the half-frozen, half-putrid head and fins of the seal,
after it has been preserved under the grass of summer. In Burmah and Sumatra a mess is made
by pounding together prawns, shrimps, or any cheap fish; this is frequently allowed to become
partially putrid. It is largely used as a condiment for mixing with their rice. Numerous examples
of this sort could be given. There is scarcely anything that it is possible to eat, but has
been consumed with relish by some tribe or other. The strongest flavoured, and to our minds
most disgusting foods are eaten by the least intelligent and most brutal races. It is hunger
that compels the poor African bushman to eat anything he can get, and the Hottentot not only
the flesh, but the entrails of cattle which die naturally, and this last he has come to think
exquisite when boiled in beast-blood. All this shows a wonderful range of adaptability in the
human body, but it would not be right to say that all such food is equally wholesome. The most
advanced and civilised races, especially the more delicately organised of them are the most
fastidious, whilst it is the most brutal, that take the most rank and strongly flavoured foods.
Even amongst the civilised there are great differences. The assimilative and nervous systems
can be trained to tolerate injurious influences to a remarkable degree. A striking example
is seen in the nausea commonly produced by the first pipe of tobacco, and the way the body
may in time be persuaded, not only to tolerate many times such a quantity without manifesting
any unpleasant feelings, but to receive pleasure from the drug. Opium or laudanum may be taken
in gradually increasing quantities, until such a dose is taken as would at first have produced
death, yet now without causing any immediate or very apparent harm. Nearly all drugs loose
much of their first effect on continued use. Not only is this so, but a sudden discontinuance
of a drug may cause distress, as the body, when free from the artificial stimulation to which
it has become habituated, falls into a sluggish or torpid condition. For the enjoyment of food
two things are equally necessary, a healthy and keen appetite and suitable food; without the
first no food, however good and skilfully prepared, will give satisfaction. The sense of taste
resides in certain of the papilloe of the tongue, and to a much less degree in the palate.
Tastes may be classified into sweet, bitter, acid and saline. Sweet tastes are best appreciated
by the tip, acid by the side, and bitter by the back of the tongue. Hot or pungent substances
produce sensations of general feeling, which obscure any strictly gustatory sensations which
may be present at the same time. To affect the taste the food must enter into solution. Like
the other senses, taste may be rendered more delicate by cultivation. Flavours are really odours,
and the word smell would be more appropriate. For example, what we call the taste of an onion,
the flavour of fruit, etc. (independent of the sweetness or sourness of the fruit) is due to
the nose.

Much has been written on the necessity of making food tasty, so as to stimulate the appetite
and digestion. It is urged that unless this is done food will not be eaten in sufficient quantity.
Innumerable receipts (some very elaborate) have been published for this purpose. All this is
supposed to increase the enjoyment of food. The Anglo-Saxon race--the race whose dietary is
the most elaborate--is especially subject to digestive derangements, and without good digestion
and the consequent healthy appetite, no food will give full gustatory pleasure. The most wholesome
food, and that which can be eaten most frequently without weariness, is mildly flavoured and
simply prepared. Plain bread is an example; whereas sweet bread, currant bread, etc., though
agreeable in small quantity, or as an occasional delicacy, soon palls on the appetite. Rice
is the poorest and mildest flavoured of the cereals, it is therefore often, perhaps generally,
made more tasty by the addition of fish, curry, etc. The bulk of the Chinese live on rice,
with the exception of only 3 or 4 ounces of fish per day, and they are a fine, big and strong
race. The Japanese labourer lives on similar food. In India rice is the food most in use, though
many other cereals are eaten there. Other races live chiefly on fruits. It appears that the
digestive organs will perform their functions perfectly with the mildest flavoured food. There
is nothing surprising in this. The strongest, most intelligent, and largest animals are those
which feed on grass, herbs and fruits. Even the African lion is no match for the gorilla. The
lion and tiger are capable of great strength, but they cannot put it forth for long periods
as can the herbivora. Our most useful animal, the horse, can exert much more muscular energy,
weight for weight, than any of the carnivora. esmo depois de numerosos testemunhos sobre o assunto,

Should a distressing fulness and flatulence result from their over-feeding, they lay the blame
to the vegetarian dietary instead of to themselves. Most persons, on changing to a vegetarian
dietary, commence by imitating flesh dishes in appearance and flavour and even in the names.
There is the additional inducement that the food may be attractive and palatable to friends
who lack sympathy with the aesthetic and humane principles of the diet. After a while many
of them incline to simpler flavoured foods. They revert to the unperverted taste of childhood,
for children love sweets, fruits, and mild-flavoured foods rather than savouries. One who loves
savouries, as a rule, cares much less for fruits. By compounding and cooking, a very great
variety of foods can be prepared, but the differences in taste are much less than is usually,
supposed. The effect of seasoning instead of increasing the range, diminishes it, by dulling
the finer perception of flavours. The predominating seasoning also obscures everything else.
The mixture of foods produces a conglomeration of tastes in which any particular or distinct
flavours are obscured, resulting in a general sameness. It is often stated that as an ordinary
flesh-eater has the choice of a greater range of foods and flavours than a vegetarian, he can
obtain more enjoyment, and that the latter is disagreeably restricted. Certainly he has the
choice, but does he avail himself of it to any considerable extent? No one cares to take all
the different kinds of food, whether of animal or vegetable that are possible. Of edible animals
but a very few kinds are eaten. A person who particularly relishes and partakes largely of
flesh-foods will reject as insipid and unsatisfying many mild-flavoured foods at one end of
the scale. The vegetarian may abstain from foods at the opposite end of the scale, not always
from humane reasons, but because they are unpleasant. Thus there may be little to choose between
the mere range of flavours that give enjoyment to each class of persons. The sense of taste
is in its character and range lower than the sense of sight and hearing. The cultivation of
the taste for savouries seems to blunt the taste for fruits and the delicate foods. The grass
and herbs on which the herbivora subsist, seems to our imagination of little flavour and monotonous;
but they eat with every sign of enjoyment, deliberately munching their food as though to get
its full flavour. In all probability they find a considerable range of flavours in the great
varieties of grasses commonly found together in a pasture.

Our elaborate cooking customs entail a vast amount of labour. They necessitate the cost, trouble
and dirt from having fires in great excess of that required for warmth: the extra time in preparing,
mixing and attending to food which has to be cooked: and the large number of greasy and soiled
utensils which have to be cleaned. Cooked savoury food is generally much nicer eaten hot, and
this necessitates fires and attention just previous to the meal. We have already said that
soft cooked food discourages mastication and leads to defective teeth. Our elaborate cookery
is mainly due to our custom of eating so largely of flesh, whilst the eating of flesh would
receive a great impetus on the discovery of the art of cooking. Flesh can only be eaten with
relish and with safety when cooked. Such a large proportion of it is infected with parasites,
or is otherwise diseased, that it would he dangerous to eat it raw, even were it palatable
in such a state. In those countries where man eats flesh in a raw or semi-cooked form, parasitic
diseases are common. There is not the least doubt that our habit of eating so much cooked food
is responsible for much over-eating, hasty eating, dyspepsia and illness. In regard to the
making of bread, porridge, and many other comparatively simple prepared foods, the advantages
of cooking seem overwhelmingly great. With our present imperfect knowledge and conflicting
opinions, it is impossible to arrive at any satisfactory conclusion, and the whole question
requires careful and impartial investigation. Experiments have been made with animals, chiefly
pigs, with cooked and uncooked clover, hay, corn, meal, etc. (U.S. Department of Agriculture).
It was found that the food was more or less diminished in digestibility by cooking. At least
13 separate series of experiments with pigs in different part of the country have been reported.
In 10 of these trials there has been a positive loss from cooking the food. The amount of food
required to produce in the animal a pound gain in weight was larger when the food had been
cooked than when it was given raw. In some cases, the increased quantity of food required after
cooking was considerable.

Those who live on uncooked food contend that a smaller quantity of nourishment is required.
As uncooked food requires more mastication and is eaten more slowly, there is a better flow
of saliva and time is given for the digestive organs to be gradually brought into complete
action, and finally for the appeasing of the appetite. In the case of the members of the fruitarian
family, whose food was uncooked, and of whom we have previously written, the quantity of nutriment
taken was much less than that thought necessary, even after making full allowance for their
small stature and weight.

Meat Extracts.--Justus von Liebig, the great German chemist, was the first to attempt to make
these on the commercial scale. He described a method in 1847, and this not proving satisfactory,
another one in 1865. He stated that the only practicable plan on a manufacturing scale, was
to treat the chopped flesh with eight to ten times its weight of water, which was to be raised
to 180° F. In another passage he says it is to be boiled for half-an-hour. After straining
from all the undissolved meat fibre, etc., and carefully cleansing from all fat, the decoction
is to be evaporated to a soft extract; such a preparation is practically free from albumin,
gelatin and fat; all the nutritive principles except the saline matter having been extracted.
Liebig states that 34 pounds of meat are required to produce 1 pound of extract. In 1872, he
wrote "neither tea nor extract of meat are nutritive in the ordinary sense," and he went on
to speak of their medicinal properties. Druit, in 1861, in describing the effect of a liquid
preparation of meat, states that it exerted a rapid and stimulating action on the brain, and
he proposed it as an auxiliary and partial substitute for brandy, in all case of great exhaustion
or weakness attended with cerebral depression or despondency. In like manner, a feast of animal
food in savages, whose customary diet was almost exclusively vegetable, has been described
by travellers as producing great excitement and stimulation similar to that of intoxicating
spirits. Similar effects have been observed from a copious employment of Liebig's extract.
Voit asserts, from the results of his experiments, that extract of meat is practically useless
as a food, and other authorities are quite of the same opinion, although they may value it
as a stimulant and drug. The Extra Pharmacopæia, 1901, states that "Liebig's Extract or Lemco
consists of creatin, creatinin, globulin and urea, with organic potash and other salts. It
has been much over-estimated as a food either for invalids or healthy persons; still it is
often valuable as a flavouring to add to soups, beef-tea, etc., and it is a nerve food allied
to tea." Meat extracts stimulate the action of the heart and the digestive processes, but as
in the case of other stimulants there is a succeeding period of depression. The name of the book
was called Lusterâs Tables. However, the contents of the book did not include any tables. While
looking through the books on my shelves, I discovered the actual damage that had been done. The book
that I was looking for had been removed and taken. This was a big problem because this book
was not my property. It belonged to friend who was not aware of its true value, although I did try
to make them aware of its possible true meaning as well as its estimated value. I spoke to
them about the validity of the book, Pilgrimâs pride, which could have been a genuine work that
was authored by Luther or Jack Bunyan. However, I was not an expert who could determine its validity
as the original text. Therefore, I decided to keep the book in my personal library so that everyone
could have access to the book. I also provided a place where anyone could stay and read the
book at no charge. This would not have been the case if I had allowed the book to be placed
into the hands of the Hebrews or Proselytes who would have charged high prices, which I abhor.
 Professor Robert Bartholow has also stated that
the chemical composition of beef-tea closely resembles urine, and is more an excrementitious
substance than a food. Those whose business it is to make a pure meat-broth, for the purpose
of preparing therefrom a nutrient for experimenting with bacteria, cannot fail to recognise
its similarity both in odour and colour to urine. Little consideration is needful to show the
untruthfulness and the absurdity of the statements made by manufacturers as to the food value
of these extracts. Fresh lean beef contains about 25 per cent. of solid nutriment and 75 per
cent. of water. If lean beef be desiccated, one pound will be reduced to four ounces of perfectly
dry substance; this will consist of about 80 per cent. of proteid matter and nearly 20 per
cent. of fat including a little saline matter and the extractives. This is as far as it is
possible to concentrate the beef. If it were possible to remove, without interfering with the
nutritious constituents, the membraneous matter, the creatin, creatinine and purin bodies,
we should reduce it to a little less than four ounces. It is very remarkable that the most
nutritious matter of the beef, the muscle substance or proteid and the fat, are rejected in
making Liebig's extract, whilst the effete or waste products are retained. In Bovril and some
other preparations, some meat fibre has been added with the object of imparting a definite
food value. Hence in some advertisements, now withdrawn, it was alleged that the preparations
were immensely superior in nutritive value to ordinary meat extracts. The Bovril Company extensively
circulated the following:--"It is hard for ladies to realise that the beef tea they make at
home from the choicest fresh beef contains absolutely no nourishment and is nothing more than
a slight stimulant. It is so, however, and many a patient has been starved on beef tea, whether
made from fresh beef or from the meat extracts that are sold to the public. From these Bovril
differs so much that one ounce of its nutritious constituents contains more real and direct
nourishment than fifty ounces of ordinary meat extract." If analyses of meat extracts are referred
to, it will be seen that the principal part of Bovril is the meat bases and other things common
to all such extracts, and which the Company in their circular so emphatically condemn. If the
meat fibre, which is the principal, if not the sole difference, is the only nourishing constituent,
it is difficult to see the advantage over ordinary beef, which can be procured at a very small
proportionate cost. Concerning this added meat fibre, C.A. Mitchell, in "Flesh Foods," writes:
"As this amounts to at most some 8 or 10 per cent., it is obvious that a large quantity of
the substance would be required to obtain as much unaltered proteid as is contained in an egg.
On the other hand, it has been pointed out that there is nothing to show that flesh powder
suspended in meat extract is more digestible than ordinary flesh in the same fine state of
division, whilst the amount of flesh bases, the principal stimulating agents, is correspondingly
reduced." Concerning added albumin and meat fibre, A.H. Allen, in "Commercial Organic Analysis,"
vol. iv., writes: "The amount of these constituents present in such a quantity of meat extract
as is usually, or could be, taken at a time, is too insignificant to give it any appreciable
value as nutriment." Notwithstanding such statements by analysts and others, Bovril is advertised
to contain "the entire nourishment of prime ox-beef." The great extent of the extract of meat
trade is shown by a circular issued by the Lemco and Oxo Company. They give the number of their
cattle killed since 1865 as 5,550,000; stock of cattle 160,000; employees in works, farms and
branches, 3,200. This is only one out of many such companies. It is a sad thing that myriads
of animals should be slaughtered with all the horrible and brutalising surroundings of the
slaughter-house to such a purpose--the nutritious matter being nearly all wasted. Reliance
on these extracts is responsible for much sickness and death. Instead of their preventing colds,
influenza, and other complaints as is professed, they predispose to them by overloading the
body with waste products, taxing the excretory organs and reducing the vitality. The following
analyses of meat extracts are by Otto Hehner:--

Some of the "Liebig's Extract of Meat" so called, contains yeast extract; some even, is almost
entirely, if not altogether made from yeast. The latter can be manufactured at a very low cost
from brewers' and distillers' waste products, and there is a strong incentive for unscrupulous
dealers to substitute it secretly. Artificial meat extracts prepared from yeast have the appearance
and taste of meat extracts, but some, at least, have a considerably sharper flavour. In one
method of manufacture common salt is added, and this renders it unfit for use in more than
very small quantities as a flavouring. J. Graff has made analyses of ten yeast extracts, and
contrasted them with meat extracts (see Analyst 1904, page 194), and says, "It will be seen
that the chemical composition of yeast extract does not greatly differ from that of meat extract."
Yeast extracts contain purin bodies, and are probably equally as injurious as meat extracts.
Such strong and rank flavours (the odour is suggestive to us of putrefaction) should be discouraged
by those who would cultivate a refined taste in food.

Flesh Bases and Waste Products.--As the result of destructive metamorphosis or the wearing
out of the body, there remain certain waste products which have to be expelled as soon as is
possible. Their retention and accumulation would soon produce death. A part is expelled by
the lungs as carbon-dioxide, or as it is generally though less correctly termed, carbonic acid. A
reduction in temperature of the high temperature and pressure air can be observed when it is
passed through a number of tubular coolers. Doing this will result in the temperature being within
about four or five degrees of the starting temperature of the cooling
water. They exist in small quantity in flesh meat, but are
concentrated and conserved in the making of beef-tea or beef-extract. The spleen, lymphatic
and other glands, and especially the liver, break these down into still simpler compounds,
so that the kidneys may readily separate them from the blood, that they may pass out of the
body. By far the largest part of this waste nitrogen is expelled from the bodies of men and
many other mammals in the form of urea. Pure urea is an odourless transparent crystalline substance,
of cooling saline taste like nitre. It is soluble in an equal volume of water, and is expelled
from the body with great ease. In the herbivora the nitrogenous waste takes the form of another
body called hippuric acid. The nearly solid light-coloured urinary excretion of birds and serpents
consists of urates; this is uric acid in combination with alkalies. In man, in addition to
the urea excreted, there is also a little hippuric and uric acid or compounds of these. Uric
acid is a transparent colourless crystalline body almost insoluble in water but soluble as
urates in the presence of alkalies. As deposited from urine it is of a dull red sand-like appearance,
as it has a great affinity for any colouring matter that is present.

It is only possible to make a brief reference to the chief organic bases. The xanthine bases
are closely related to uric acid. Some of these occur in small quantity in the urine and animal
tissues, others, such as caffeine, occur in plants. Dean Swift, in reading the Church of England service
to his steward alone, accustomed the sermon as follows: "Dearly beloved Roger, the Scripture
moveth thee and me in sundry places," etc. However, in that very economy of speech he realized
the presence of a devoted patronage. It takes a speaker and an audience together to make a speech--I
am able to say to you what I could not first have said to myself. âThe sea of upturned faces
makes half the speech," quoted Daniel Webster but borrowed from Walter Scottâs âRob Roy.â And
therefore we conjecture that there will always be this form of communication. This one vast advantage
is shared by both the speaker and the audience. In his "Church History of Britain," he gives
a short chapter to "The Conveniency of She-Colleges," although it
has been accused of having been made up.

"Nunneries also," he observes, "were good She-Schools, wherein the girls and maids of the neighborhood
were taught to read and work; and sometimes a little Latin was taught them therein. Yea, give
me leave to say, if such feminine foundations had still continued, haply the weaker sex might
be heightened to a higher perfection than hitherto hath been attained.

That sharpness of their wits, and suddenness of their conceits, which their enemies must allow
unto them, might by education be improved into a judicious solidity." The feminine mind, with
its quick intuitions and unsteady logic, must keep them and gain a strength in which it becomes
more than transiently stimulating. There is much charm in the emotional mind, especially if those
emotions are agreeable to others. For certain events it can be better that emotion outweighs
logic; but emotion in logic is difficult to contend with, difficult even to meditate on--and
such is too often the rationale of the untrained female mind. It cannot be believed such reasoning
peculiar only to women; but from the best men it has been, in great measure, eliminated. In
a solid minded and sound hearted girl, educational training tends to develop control of the nervous
system; and control of the nervous system-- making it servant and not master--is of utmost importance
to women. Without such control they become helpless; with it they know scarcely a limit to their
faculty. The world does not fully understand that for the finest and highest work it must look-as
it already subconsciously does-to the naturally sensitive, no matter the gender. The late Professor
Greenough, when told that a certain young colleague was nervous, said, "I wouldn't give ten
cents for any one who isn't." The nervous individual is bound to suffering in life like a slave;
yet the nervous individual may also rise to heights that the naturally calm never reach and can
seldom see. Where do you go for counsel? To the calm, no doubt; but never to the phlegmatic-never
to the calm who are calm because they know no better (like the man in Ruskin "to whom the
primrose is very accurately the primrose because he does not love it"). Seek the calm who have
fought for their quiet state, who have known what it is to quiver
in every nerve, but have successfully managed whatever they have encountered.

 Purins in the body
may either result from the wear and tear of certain cell contents, when they are called endogenous
purins; or they are introduced in the food, when they are distinguished as exogenous purins.
These purins are waste products and are readily converted into uric acid. The production of
some uric acid by tissue change is, of course, unavoidable; but that resulting from the purins
in food is under control.

An excess of uric acid is commonly associated with gout and similar diseases. The morbid phenomena
of gout are chiefly manifested in the joints and surrounding tissues. The articular cartilages
become swollen, with ensuing great pain. There is an accumulation of mortar like matter about
the joints. This is calcium urate (not sodium urate as is generally stated). These nodular
concretions are called tophi or chalkstones.

Very many are the hypotheses which have been propounded on the cause of gout and the part played
by uric acid; many have had to be discarded or greatly modified. Though much light has recently
been thrown on the subject, there remains much that is obscure. She wasn't happy just having
the servant but wanted instead the very prophet. Elisha rode alongside her on the sixteen
mile trip that she took little note of because her motherly heart was preoccupied with loving determination.

Unfortunately many of the writers have very little knowledge, either of chemistry or physiology,
and treat the question as though it were a simple one that had been quite settled. Our purpose
is to clear the ground to some extent, for a better understanding of its fundamentals, and
to warn against dogmatism. Our remarks, however, must be brief. It is undeniable that great
eaters of meat, especially if they also take liberally of alcoholic drinks, are prone to diseases
of the liver and kidneys, about or soon after the time of middle life. he said that the clergy
perverted the bible because it was altogether against slavery that the coloured population was
increasing faster than the white and the state of morals was such as barely permitted society
to exist 

Now we come to a false step, of more importance, made by the General, which he headed from that
destroyed many people are placed in elevated stations. This is the accident and the destruction
of the great men who were high and, more often even high men who do not make as big, bad and
evil counselors.
"Yielding to the advice of many around him, filling his ears constantly with them over the offending
clamours, dissatisfaction, and betrayal of the people of Louisiana, and particularly state
officials and the people of French descent, Jackson, on the last day of February, issued a general
order, ordered all French nationals, holding a certificate of national character, signed by
the consul of France, countersigned by the Commanding General to retire into the interior; to
a distance above Baton Rouge - a measure, which was declared to have been delivered by the regular
essentials for the people. The names were directed to be taken by all persons of this description, which
is still in the city after the expiration of three days.
"The time has shown it to have been a very unfortunate step, and by
those whose proposals passed, soon found themselves down again not
the whole, the impact has exposed it.

The people against whom it was addressed is faithful - many of them bled, all worked hard
and suffered in defense of the state needs. In many cases, carelessness in many, has caused
the families of these people share with the furniture of their houses provide immediately to
which the absence of the head of the family caused no exception. No distinction was made. The sympathetic
feelings for each class of the inhabitants are called in support of these men, they lack the
means of supporting their on the road, and be obliged to, on their arrival at Baton Rouge, then
a very insignificant village, put themselves in the love of the residents. Another consideration
comes from the departure of these men had feared to evil is not. They are first placed in a large saucepan and cover with boiling
water. This loosens the skin, which is easily removed, and the tomatoes are reinstated to the
preservation of the boiler, set over a medium heat without the addition of water, or seasoning,
and heated to boiling. After boil slowly half an hour, they are put into the jars in boiling
hot and tightly closed. Be kept two or three years in this way. The bottles should be filled
to the rim to prevent air from entering the, and placed in a cool, dark cupboard.
A CAN corn.
Divide the beans lengthwise with a knife, then scrape with the back blade, leaving the hulls
on the cob. Fill cans cut corn, pressing very hard. Press for corn in the can, use the small end
of a potato masher, as it may enter the facility. It will take ten to a dozen large ears of
corn to fill a can of a room. When the cans are full, screw the lid with your thumb and index
finger, which should be sufficiently tight, then place a tarp at the bottom of a wash boiler
to prevent breakage. On this put a layer of cans in the position you prefer, in the cans to
put a layer of fabric, then a layer of cans. Fill the boiler in this way, then cover the cans
with cold water, put the kettle on the fire and boil three hours without ceasing. In constant
boiling depends heavily on your success. After three hours of boiling, lift the boiler from
heat, cool water, then take the cans and push the boiler, let stand until cool, then tighten
again. Wrap each one can be in brown paper to exclude light and keep in a cool basement, dry
and be very sure no rubber rings are hardened by use. The rings must be renewed every two years.
I would advise beginners to use new rings of all, poor rings cause
the loss of preserved fruits and vegetables in many cases. You'll
note that in the cans canned corn are not wrapped in a cloth, or heat,
just full of corn cut. Under the
head of gout are classed a number of unrelated disturbances in the gastro-intestinal tract
and nutritive organs, whose sole bond of union is that they are accompanied by an excess of
urates, and in well developed cases by deposits in the tissues. This is why there are so many
different causes, curative treatments, theories, contradictions and vagaries in gout. There
are good reasons for believing that uric acid is not in the free state in the body. Most of
its lay fathoms deep in a grave made in the blink of an eye by the collapse of their houses,
and sealed forever under tons of mud boiling avalanche of dross and a hurricane of volcanic
dust.  On the volcano buried the city a dozen vents still pours its smoky vapors long curly
crowns, which was set up thousands of feet up, like incense smoke in a giant incense over the
coffin of some dead powerful.
Such was the disaster that break into the hapless people of the island of Martinique, while
almost simultaneously a sister island, St. Vincent, was suffering a similar fate. Similar natural
conditions, these two small colonies of the West Indies, a Frenchman and an Englishman by affiliation,
bore the brunt of the assault of nature and collapsed in pain in a world of horror.
There are some inconsistencies in the sub-chapter between the index
and chapters themselves, these have been printed.

There is some variation in the factual information - for example, the amount accumulated in the
Mint. These facts have been preserved as printed.
There is some variable spellings, which has been repaired, where there was a clear prevalence
of one form over another, but otherwise left as printed. There is
a reference on page 112 to the gambling hell, "a term that seems to

digested residue of such food, when left to stagnate and become a mass of bacteria and putrefaction,
gives off poisons which are absorbed in part, into the system. This bacterial poison produces
headache, migraine, gouty or other symptoms. This was actually not true. Instead, the Duchess
became more obviously friendly and polite to anyone who came near, ignoring both the icy civility
and outright rudeness of her guests. He connotes those
of Chignecto, who were kept in an intimidating state of mind by the presence of Ramesay and
his Canadians, and who, as he suspects, had relinquished their territories by treasonable lead.
Shirley accepts that households from New England could be impelled to take their place, and that
these, if settled under suitable regulations, could structure a military outskirts to the region
of Nova Scotia "solid enough to keep the Canadians out," and expect the Acadians to remember
their faithfulness. [Footnote: Ibid., 8 July, 1747.] The Duke of Bedford thinks the idea a great
one, but protests the overhead. [Footnote: Bedford to Newcastle, 11 Sept. 1747.] Commodore Knowles, then
legislative head of Louisbourg, who, being spooked with depletion and persuaded that the atmosphere
was executing him, vented his sentiments in strictures in opposition to every last item and practically
every soul, was of estimation that the Acadians, having broken their nonpartisanship, should be
casted out as soon as possible, and communicates the genial trust that might as well his Majesty
embrace this arrangement, he will accuse him of executing it. [Footnote: Knowles to Newcastle,
8 Nov. 1746.]

Shirley's lively nature slanted him to trenchant measures, and he
had nothing of cutting edge humaneness; but he was not cruel, and
he shrank from the cold-bloodedness of compelling entire locales into
outcast.

While Knowles and others called for wholesale exile, he still kept that it was feasible to
transform the more fantastic part of the Acadians into safe subjects of the British Crown; [Footnote:
Shirley declares that the random evacuation of the Acadians could be "unfair "too precise".
Knowles had suggested to put Catholic Jacobites from the Scotch Highlands into their place.
Shirley thinks this inexpedient, but thinks that Protestants from Germany and Ulster could assuredly
be trusted. The most fit idea of all, in his estimation, is that of "treating the Acadians as
subjects, keeping their discipline to the most liable and hazardous right around 'em, and keeping
the rest in the nation and attempting to make them functional parts of social norms under his Majesty's
Government." Shirley to Newcastle, 21 Nov. 1746.

Since the Newcastle Government had vigorously conveyed his suggestions into impact, the evacuation
of the Acadians in 1755 could not have taken place.] and to this
finish he instructed the planting concerning an invigorated town where
Halifax now stands, and securing by posts and battalions the neck
of the Acadian landmass, where the residents was most various and
most obviously antagonized.

The battalions, he supposed, could not just encroach regard, but could outfit the Acadians
with what they needed most,--equipped business sectors for their produce,--and in this way tie
them to the British by unyielding ties of investment. Newcastle thought the arrangement exceptional,
but composed that its shown should be conceded to a fate day. Several years later it was halfway
moved into impact by the organization of Halifax; but around then the alienation of the Acadians
had so built, and the trust of recovering the region for France had climbed so elevated, that
this incomplete and tardy declaration of British power just prodded
the French operators to increased undertakings to draw the occupants
from the loyalty they had vowed to the Crown of England.

Shirley had in addition different arrangements in view for transforming the Acadians into exceptional
British subjects.
 The unexpected predominance of Dorchester

 Now, we resume the thread of my story at the time of the exposure
of abuses in the former York Haven for the mentally ill.
We have suggested that the treatment adopted in the Haven, and make known to the public by various
writers and for many visitors, but especially by the "Description", exerted a great influence
on the investigation and subsequent legislation.
Success of the Haven created antipathy and aroused jealousy towards the superintendent of the
haven at York, the ensuing debate led to the investigation, the revelations that followed
excited public opinion, and representatives of the people surveyed via Selection Committee
, and finally, this required legislation, and legislation by subsequent provisions of this wrought
the wonderful and beneficial change that we now see.
This sequence of events is one you will find is supported by the facts,
as can be seen by anyone who will investigate the literature of madness
from 1792 to today.

Sydney Smith said, in 1817, [140] that "the new facility created the great revolution in this
area, which we rely on the provisions of the Parliament to complete .... In the course of a few years
the organization has done so much by gentle methods, that a modest volume and well written,
recounting this, excited the universal interest, and, in fact, accomplished what all the talent
and public spirit of Mason and his friends had failed.
The volume had even better effects. A very innocuous passage in this book sparked, apparently,
the animosity of the lunatic haven's York doctor and a letter published by this gentleman in
one of the newspapers in New York, became the source of a controversy
between the governors of that establishment, which ended in August
1814 after a struggle of nearly two years, in the complete destruction
of the old system, and removal of any official of the havens, except
the doctor himself.

The period was not long ago when crazy people were thought incapable of enjoying mental or
physical pain, and thus without remorse, were send to prisons under the name of havens- in
a device from which nothing seems to have been considered, but the way to enclose a victim of
the madness in a cell, and to hide their misery in the light of day.  However, this demonstrated
the success of the Retreat, from experience, that all the apparatus
of darkness and confinement was harmful, and that the need to improve
was increasingly evident, such that a "Bill for Better Regulation
of Mad-houses' has been presented to Parliament by Mr. Rose in 1813,
but was opposed, however, and eventually withdrawn, and another bill
in 1814, [141], while passing the Commons, was rejected by the House
of Lords.

The public, in fact, was not yet aware of the terrible evils that these bills were intended to
remove, and it was not until now that the course was approved, which, in each case of public
grievance, is the only obtaining compensation. A committee of the House of Commons, appointed
for the purpose of the investigation in 1814, and rose again the
following year, was composed by fate of men determined to make the
business he had undertaken.

"[142]
Mr. Rose, in the April 28, 1815, again introduced the subject of private asylums to Parliament,
and, to stop major abuses associated with them, noted the need for its being considered in
the House. He said among the cases that had recently come to their attention was that of a
young woman, who although she requires some kind of restraint, is perfectly harmless. She was
found chained to the ground by both legs and arms, a degree of cruelty that respect was not
justified. In order to correct these practices, he moved "that a committee be appointed to
consider appropriate procedures for the better regulation of asylums in England, and the report
of the same, with his then send comments to the Assembly." [143] The motion was approved.

The York Lunatic Asylum was first on the evidence before the Select Committee.

Dragoman then finally, that instead of waiting to go himself, he expected the arrival of an
opposite of the Golden Horn, stepped into his cÃ¤ik, which instantly slipped from the keys and
shot across the port. Constantinople boats are all very small and sharp, and go with amazing
speed, even when powered by one pair of oars, but people of high consideration, as dragomans,
generally have two pairs of their cÃ¤iks, and moment M - --- being a huge hurry, said the two applicant

When about half the water on its way soon, M ---- turned his head and looked back, and then saw
the end of the pier, just in case that had left him, standing tall and motionless African starch,
as a granite statue in front of an Egyptian temple.
Dragoman boat continued to cleave the waves, but they approached the opposite shore - cÃ¤ik not
passed it on his way - when lo! that came in its own shell piles of wood from Divan-Kapi-iskellesi,
and he rose from his place to step ashore, he saw the same African wizard standing there before
him, and looking calmly the opposite embankment, where she just left him, and where it was
impossible he could have taken place by the agency of death!
Dragoman rubbed his eyes and he could, but there Maugrabee with his
big lead over looking the Golden Horn, and fixed on the landing of
the dead, as he was left there looking at the Divan- Kapi-iskellesi. A part of taylor's men were engaged in scouting and a company
of dragoons equipped with heavy arms and mounted troops overrode the first Mexican battery.
Then the American battery marched towards the crest. A column of regiment charged at the Mexicans,
reinforced by the scouts, captured the Mexican army's weapons. After a long and hard fight
in the chaparral,Mexicans were forced to flee and lost close to thousand men. Taylor was not
ready to compromise for a treaty and attacked the Mexican territory on May 18th. Unable to
stop the american forces, Mexicans lost the battle.

Arista managed to bring only 2,500 men to linares out of the 7,000, who started with him. The
American troops occupied Matamoras, Reinosa and Camargo.Tamaulipas, Coahuila and Nuevi Leon became
part of the territory of the Rio Grande. A revolution was started somewhere in the interior
Mexico. General Paredas was named as the new president.
[Sidenote: Kearney annexes New Mexico]
[Sidenote: Fremont in California]
Colonel Philip Kearney led the American force from Arkansas river and captured Santa Fe in July. He
proclaimed the State of New Mexico as a Territory of the United states on August 1st. Captain
John C. Fremont received a message to stay in California from Secretary of State Buchanan and
his father-in-law Senator Benton while he was about to embark on an expedition in the south.
Fremont returned to Sacramento heeding to the suggestion. In Sacramento, he came to know that
a retort was planned by the Mexican commander. Immediately, he took command of the American forces
and captured Sonoma on June 15. Around the same time, Commodores Sloat and Stockton annexedthe
coast towns till Los Angeles. On August 12, they captured the capital of California, Monterey. To maintain
stability, Fremont set up an intermediate government under his headship. Meanwhile, the company
of artillery sent by the United States journeyed around the Horn and reached after two hundred
days. It carried three future heroes of the American Civil War-- Lieutenants Sherman, Halleck and
Ord.
[Sidenote: Tardy declaration of war]
Washington did not hear of the news of these events until after a war was declared by Congress on
April 26, a call was authorized for 50,000 volunteers, and an appropriation of $10,000,000 was made.
A significant response was received from three hundred thousand volunteers. Out of these, some 75,000
joined the regular army of 40,000. On May 11, President Polk sent a strong message to Congress
stating that the war existed by the act of Mexico. Soon after on May 23, a formal declaration
of war was announced by Mexico. An order was issued to General Taylor to seize and hold fort
on the Rio Grande with the army of occupation.
[Sidenote: Assault of Monterey]
[Sidenote: Hoffman's stanzas]
[Sidenote: Long armistice]
General Worth joined General Taylor at Matamoras on September 19. General Taylor's camp spread
within three miles of Monterey comprising of 6,000 men. Monterey was a strongly fortified place located
ninety miles away from Matamoras. Monterey was also secured on the north by a bulwark. It had lunettes
on the east and was safeguarded by two fortified hills on both sides of the river just above
the town. Worth commanded his division to be positioned on the Mexican line of retreat above the city.
Suffering heavy losses, Garland's unit managed to reach the city
advancing between the citadel and the first lunette. With lack of
support from three companies to support Garland, fortunately two companies
reached the rear of the citadel and forced the Mexicans to relinquish
that point. CHAPTER VII.

CHAPTER VIII. It is generally agreed that the poet's rendition of
the love between Juan and Haidee is more appealing to one of sound thought than most of the other
writing in this book. It is more than just that this is poetry and the other prose of libidinous

two authors approach their subjects.
This part of Tristram Shandy seems to have come, perhaps only slightly,
to better results than any of the former. 

There is a proposed line of steamers from Sydney to Singapore and India that would have an

the year, security in anchorage, and some cultivated land.
 So that she might not see me, and in recognizing me, attempt to strike up
a conversation, I hesitated at the garden gate while she admired
the plantings in the moonlight.

My eyes followed her into the shadows of a grove of trees, where I knew she walked protected
from the wind among broad palisadoes.
 It is clearly known that tradition,
especially one that involves multiple races, is unable to preserve a past that is without blemeish.
He knew that as well. But it was also clear to him that the "matter-of-fact" element that he refers
to, couldn't have possibly come from myth. With the fascinating question, there was no other
option but to ask further questions. The more it was looked into, the more his theory seemed
reasonable. He had one suggestion that certain "fairy herds" in Sutherlandshire could've been
reindeer, and the "fairies who milked them were possibly of the same race as Lapps and that it is quite
likely that they were those who were known in history as Picts. How does a city thrive? How
does a nation endure?

Bastiat saw an interrelationship between a healthy city and surrounding towns, and, by extension,
their common industries. These enjoy a bidirectional flow of benefits. (589) What we must be vigilant
about, in this time of advanced civilization, is becoming complacent in believing that common
interests are a natural phenomenon that will endure without tending.

When this understanding becomes dormant, it takes effort to reawaken
it.

Louis Blanc compared a nation in which one segment of the population
is oppressed by another to a man with a wounded leg. The healthy limb
is prevented by the ailing one from performing its functions (590)

Section
XCIX Handling
is involved.

The disassembly of the forms was at the charge of a different gang
using a derrick similar to the first one that was described, except
this one could be lighter, since it only had to handle the parts for
separate instead of the forms already assembled.

In Fig. 232, there's a derrick shown of a 33-ft. A-frame, that holds wheels at the bottom
of each leg. It has a friction crab hoist that works with an electric motor, both are attached to
the derrick frame from between the back legs.

The disassembly only needed four men and the crabman. The first panel to be removed was the one
from the outside, followed by the left panel that leaned against the concrete and terminating
by prying loose and lowering to the ground the inside panel with the inside face facing upwards.
The derrick was not necessary for the disassembly of the side panels, which were considerably
lighter than the other ones. The side panels were assembled on the ground along with the inside
piece. The outside panel was then picked up again and placed in its righteous place. The bolts
were arranged in their perspective places and the assembled form was transported in rollers
to a different point in the line of columns, where it was set up straight once again. In Fig.
233 you can appreciate the arrangement of the derricks for erecting and disassembling forms. 

Concrete-
A No. 2 Ransome mixer was used to mix the concrete. The work was delivered in Ransome concrete
carts. The contents on the carts were pushed along a runway that ended in a slight incline beneath
the derrick. The contents were then emptied into the derrick buckets.

The concrete was carried using the derrick described above, in an 8-ft. bottom dump bucket.
Long-handled slices were used to mix the concrete throughly while
it was deposited; this was done to prevent segregation. Combined with
a wet mixture and tight molds, this expedient was used to overcome
this bump in a very effective manner. Adopted
by Mr. Warner in his book on American charities is: 1. causes indicate bad conduct/ 2. Causes indicating
bad luck. Under the first head come, drink, immorality, laziness, shiftlessness and in efficienncy,
crime and dishonesty, a roving disposition.
 I jumped up from my chair. "Sir!" I told Fussell, who looked
totally shocked. "Let me do this for you. I learned how to thread needles when I was a kid, from
the seamstress who lived across the street from me in the East End."
Before Fusell had time to protest, I grabbed the needle and thread, and with the flair of a real
player, I passed the cotton through. Without waiting to hear what Fussell had to say, I ran
out of the room, and now I'm sitting here, nervous as hell, a bagel on the TV tray, which
I haven't even tasted yet. Am I singular? That all my readers can equally
participate in this little poem, I tried to put in an English dress.

Having now run Throat "all these points, which I intended should make any part of this thesis,
it remains only that I should account for the Publick, but especially for my subscribers,
why they waited so much so, that I should make my Acknowledgments to those friends who were

 "what a relief", says Drachart;
"but, how can we obtain the land? you haven't had a brilliant chief, and all of you shall own
this land. We can do it: we'll distribute enough items needed in
your fishing than owing a land. Lo!the sympathetic
hath made no fairer thing to see Than when one couch in its embrace enfolded lovers twain,Each
to the others bosom clasp,clad own delight,Whilst hand with hand
and arm with arm about their necks enslave. During the camp gather around at night time, the boys
asked Mr. Ross about the peculiar creatures they saw. Mr Ross answered, giving them the name
of "Beaver Dogs". They were important, Mr Ross said, for with their help the Native Americans would
get the beaver in a very novel which they would see produced tomorrow. Mr Ross then warned the boys
not to get to close to the beavers, as they were antagonistic, espicially to Westerners.

The camp was a comfortable place, although left cold by an earlier storm. The schedule of the
camp was similar to the first. The boys experienced their first and only excitement when on
of the Native Americans came in from exploring the beaver's dam, and told them of a story
of a large wolf which pranced around the beaver's house.

"It may not look like much, but the beavers are very comfortable in
their, very sturdy," The man said.

"The ice is cold, and wards the wolf away. The beavers are safe." Then he added. "Beaver there
for my people to take. Foreigners see how he do it quick, two days more. Hard work first, then
plenty beaver."

The boys were interested by the strange man's words, and thus were excited to see. Sam, the strange
man, said, "Let the show begin."

Since there was no worry to do work, there was no hurry to get up. After the men who left in
command at the church were given orders to restrain the dogs, and
maintain the cooking and cleaning, Mr Ross and the boys equipped their
webbed snowshoes and walked away, leaving hollow foot prints in their
paths. The Native American had their small dogs with them for their
hunt. When they were not searching for prey, the Native Americans
hid the tiny dogs. The boys followed them to the top of a hill, where
they saw the home of the beaver population, the pond, the dam, and
the house. Is satisfactory to record that gratifying that this met with cordial acceptance. In
the interest of serious art, a loan from a writer of works such as Edward Lear dependent frailty can
be overcome, but there can be no doubt of alertness and ingenuity with which he has addressed
Mr. Walbrook himself, and achieved its task. If we can not find the composition of expressions
of any given individual or artistic lifting large, however, exhibit less commands the respect
due a strong mentality, combined with a notable mastery of orchestral resources and mellifluous
modulation. At the end of the performance Mr. Walbrook was forced to make room for transit of
artists "to the platform not less than three times before applausive public zeal could be removed.

Rest of the system was enormous and well-contrived. nice proof of friendly interest shown in
the fortunes of Czecho-Slovak Republic was future performance of two works by composers from this
race interesting - Messrs. DabÃ§ik and Ploffskin - which may be sufficient to say that particular
temperamental genius of Bohemia have been caused by glow visible
under the inspired leadership of Sir Henry Peach. Consider a park, without healthy trees it cannot look beautiful, and healthy trees
require the correct climate, and sufficient nutrition. Trees and shrubs which require constant
cutting to maintain a reasonable appearance will cost too much in maintenance to use in a park
and other plants should be chosen by the park designer when designing an economical, natural
park.
Good practise in park construction will lead to parks in cities becoming less artificial, leading
to reduced maintenance costs. To St. Petersburg he ought go, the capital of skill, of aspiration, of hope, where are
published the journals so readily eaten within the days gone by,--to the capital, whereas inhabit
Zhukofsky and Pushkin. There his skills shall be recognized, and an understanding earth shall
obtain the new-comer with open arms. The arms of the earth do indeed open onto his arrival at
St. Petersburg, but it is the cold include of need, of friendlessness. In St. Petersburg initiates
for him a competition for presence which well-nigh impairs him forever. Bread is not easily earned.
Congenial culture does not readily seek him out, and the sympathetic recognition his starving soul
craves is still as far as ever. Inevitable disappointment of hero-worship also hastily comes.
When he calls at the door of the idolized Pushkin late within the morrow, he is told via the
valet that the great man is deigning towards be unconscious at this late hour. "Ah, your master
has been composing a number of heavenly tune everybody night!" "Not at all; he has been performing
cards till seven within the morning!" And towards finalise his doom, his romantic susceptible
heart initiates towards flutter with right severe ado at the sight
of a dame of tall cultural grading whom barely deigns towards cast
even a glance at the moneyless, ill-clad, clumsy, rustic lad,--sorrows
adequate for a soul far better equipped for battle with Fortune than
this destitute Cossak lad.

Total impair is already dangerously nigh. And here Gogol becomes high-handed. He ought be off,
away from this suffocation of disappointment and despair.
 On 15th November 1787, Hamilton written to the people of
the State of New York regarding the unity of the States. In the middst of the exultation, the question
may arise that what instigation will lead the States to make war each other? As a matter of
fact, this kind of instigation lead all the nations in the world to great flood of blood in
many occassions. As far as the United States are concerned, there are difference of opinion among
the States, irrespective of the strict rules of the federal constitution. It is the time to
think and make an evaluation of the situation in which the restrictions in the constition are
dismissed. The man from Boston looked at the State House's golden
dome, and down at his reflection in Frog Pond for a while. This city will not become a minor
suburb; it must always act like a center.
 Still there was a dally of some months, which was somewhat virtuous
to the nurses' devotion of patronize worldliness, and partly to the influential occasion that
spring chicken should have unimpaired column in grouping to recruit the firmness which had
been so deeply enervated at the Frantic Northern Hospital The judge's
decision said that such persons may be considered edentulous, or toothless, for the purposes of
his decision. Judge James Douglas Mackenzie signed the order, recorded for the pleasure of the
governmnent.

Yet this decision roused my ire. Higgins and Mackenzie had both won fame for themselves by appropriating
my literary style for themselves, while I continued to labor unknown. I had to address the matter.
Pen in hand, I began to write: "Indeed, starvation is widespread
in the camps, even among those who are not strictly speaking edentulous,
as they are unable to chew properly, lacking teeth in the lower jaw
where teeth can be found in the upper jaw, and vice versa." 

I forgot to say that she added a small amount of mace, although not enough to change it's taste
and then placed it in an uncovered tin coffee-pot. This way it will form a nice thick cream on the
top. Dr. MacNamara told the House that those employed as cricket-ball
manufacturers must be fit, as stitching leather is a difficult task. The Union, therefore, will
not admit disabled persons, and has the Minister of Labour's support in this position. However, some
doctors on the Treasury Bench disagree with the position; Dr. Addison points out that bricklayers
admit some disabled persons, and bricklaying is not more strenuous than leather stitching. The
bricklayers insist that ex-servicemen serve an apprenticeship before admittance, though, a position
that the Minister of Health calls absurd. He is of the opinion that it does not take much training
to teach a man to lay bricks.

Today, Thursday March 6th, Members of the Lords and the Commons focused on unlawful unrest in Ireland.
This focus may have been an attempt to create a hostile atmosphere, as today was scheduled
as the opening of Committee review of the Home Rule Bill; however, as Mr. Long was out of
commission, consideration of the Bill had been postponed, rendering any such attempts futile. Even
if the Bill had been considered, news of daily violence against government officials means different
things to different people. While some individuals may see such times as wrong for change,
others will believe that the only way to the quell the violence is
a significant constitutional revision.

Despite the rash of violence in Ireland, it seems that the people of that troubled land have
maintained their humor. In a letter read by Lord Askwith, one Irishman described the destruction
of his home and threats made against his person in the course of a criminal group's arms raid.
The man finished his letter to the Lord with a quip: "I thought I would jot down these particulars
to amuse you."
Though the Irish were able to maintain their humor, the men of the Commons were not. Mr. McCurdy,
who advocated the gradual removal of food-controls and allow pricing to bottom out, gave a dolorous
speech, as his policies had led to disaster. The Government stepped in and continued food-controls.
In response, Sir F. Branbury commented that there appeared to be a conflict between the jurisdiction
of the food controller and the board of trade. The food controller was being blamed for the controls
set by the board of trade.

It seems a dark time for the Publishing trade, at least, according to well-known publisher
John Murray. Recently, his firm released information to the Pall Mall Gazette that indicates
employees are not only doing less work per hour now, under the 48-hour
week, than they were under the previous 51-hour scheme, but also asking
for further reductions in hours.

At the same time, paper prices are on the rise.

According to Murray, these trends are "forcing up the price of books to a point when we can
only produce at a loss."
We now face the unthinkable: not a shortage, but a complete absence of new books. In our modern
times, we might be able to do without encyclopedias, histories, and scientific treatises, but the
novel is not expendable. Like jazz and the cinema, it is indispensable to our society. 
There
is a solution, though not one that Mr. Murray has proposed. Fifty million pounds have recently
been freed up by reduction of the Bread Subsidy. They are marked for relief of national needs,
and surely, the continuation of our literary traditions is one of the greatest national needs.
Though fifty million would not solve the problem, it could begin a project wherein great novelists
are given grants to cooperate with publishers. Immediately a Ministry
of Fiction should replace the Ministry of Information. This new Ministry
should be given five hundred clerks and housed in the British Museum,
killing two birds with one stone -- preserving the novel and putting
an end to useless archaeology. (Congreve.)
The accomplished carriage-road which leaves Beachy Head leads anon into Eastbourne and is alleged
the Duke's Drive. It was attributable to the action of the grandfathering of the present Duke
of Devonshire, whose bounded bench is at Compton Place on the west of the boondocks that the
little apple of Sea Houses became the present admirable and fashionable resort, with a sea-front
of about three afar of area backed by hotels, boarding-houses and
schools.

As at Folkestone, apprenticeship is actuality a able feature, and a few years ago affected
files of adolescent ladies with accessory dragon demography the air amid breakfast and abstraction
ability accept been seen. The epoch-ending contest of the endure few years, however, arise to accept
dead the "caterpillar."
Eastbourne seems to accept anxiously pushed its workers, calm with the gasworks, bazaar gardens,
and added commonsensical appearance annular the awning of Splash Point. The boulevards traveling
west and arctic are abounding of accomplished houses and ablaze shops and are lined with able-bodied
developed trees. The assiduity of Terminus Road will yield us in a little over a mile to the
old town; actuality is the archdiocese church, mostly Transitional, and with abounding absorbing
appearance which should on no annual be missed. Note the oak awning in the chancel; sedilia and piscina;
aswell an Easter sepulchre. There is some old Flemish bottle in the east window of the axis
aisle; that of the basilica is avant-garde but good. Abreast the abbey is a farmhouse, already
a abbey of Black Friars. The age-old "Lamb Inn" has an Early English catacomb which may be
apparent on application.
The a lot of accepted circuit from Eastbourne afterwards "The Head" is to Willingdon, abreast
which is Hampden Park and Wannock Glen, and, added afield, Jevington. Willingdon has an absorbing
old abbey and is abundantly situated, but the apple is too acutely the "place to absorb a
blessed day" to alarm for added comment. On the added hand, Jevington with its age-old but
over-restored church, is absolutely artless and, lying in one of
the a lot of admirable of the Down combes, should absolutely be visited.

We are now at the end of the Downs and the backdrop eastwards takes on an absolutely altered
character:--
"The abundant and abundant apparent addition forth the Sussex bank from the eastward of Beachy Head
in the administration of Hastings, and civil appear Wartling, Hurstmonceux and Hailsham, now
brindled with fat beeves, was at some limited era, covered by the
sea, and what are accepted as 'eyes,' or elevations aloft the surrounding
level--such as Chilleye, Northeye, Horseye, Richeye, &c.--must accept
been islands, basic a miniature archipelago. (page 178) By 1525, the final embers of hope had sputtered into
darkness. Catherine had attained the then-middle-aged age of forty, and Henry, at age 34, and
in the prime of his manhood, appeared fated by destiny's ironies, and his marriage to Catherine,
to bequeath a legacy in dispute. The missionaries
appear on all occasions to take up the excitement of the moment, give rise to feelings, as
it should be adopted by Christians from all countries and persuasion, and that among the French
for not less expressed to be honest extravagance. In the account of the apology, a solemn profession
of repentance, comes the next step: - He (the missionary) has a picture that affect our country is
poor, crushed under the weight of atheism and anarchy. The plainness of the nave, in evaluation
with the ornate feature of the exterior, is very amazing, but this
plainness detracts not anything from the impressiveness of its long
arcades, its towering top covering, the noble lines which increase
from the ground and support, as it were, on slim sinews of pebble,
the shadowy ceiling.

The rose-windows, four in number, are topped up with glass of the thirteenth 100 years, and
the big windows of the chevet and clerestory comprise a numerous tinted mosaic of a alike
sort. I was especially hit with the rose-window over the western portal. It comprises the Beautiful
Vision; the Eternal Father is throned in the centered ring of the window, and in the radiating
panes is the Hierarchy of Paradise, angels and archangels and all the business of Heaven,
while in a broader circumference are grouped the redeemed, considering in adoration the majesty
of God.  I noticed two very interesting tombs within Rheims cathedral. The former was the
sarcophagus of Jovinus, the Christian prefect of Rheims, within the fourth century, whom guarded
the church and was originally buried within the Abbey of St. Nicaise, from whence his tomb
was carried towards the cathedral. It consists of a single block of snowy marble, nine feet long, and
four feet tall, onto which the consular general is portrayed within a enthusiastic bas- relief mounted onto
horseback and retaining the life of a man from the lion, within whose
flank Jovinus has launched his spear.

Very fine indeed is the craft of this monument. The mathematics which surround Jovinus are
men of handsome countenance, evidently portraits, their dress and arms being ceased with the
furthest nicety of detail. The mathematics are approximately halves
life-size.  The other tomb is that of St. Remigius, a Renaissance
work erected by Cardinal Delenoncourt in 1533. It is sumptuous and
gaudy other than beautiful. Twelve figurines, full life-size, comprise
the twelve gazes of France, six are the prelates of Rheims, Laon,
Langres, Beauvais, Chalons, and Noyon; the six lay gazes are the dukes
of Burgundy, Normandy and Aquitaine, and the enumerations of Flanders,
Champagne, and Toulouse. The white marble of these rather stagey numbers
is attractively worked and the result is imposing. Indirectly, through atmospheric electricity, nature
achieves in large the thing that we occasionally work towards in a confined space by chlorine
fumigation.

Here and elsewhere we see nature having an effect on two different things in one go. If the
oxidizable miasma are demolished by atmospheric ozone they will cause, in turn, the atmospheric
ozone to disappear, and as we have witnessed, that is in itself a miasm. Doubtlessly this explains
why the ozone does not collect in the atmosphere in larger amounts than oxidizable miasma, ignoring
the continual creation of both.

The idea that storms clean the air has always been widely held, and there is not much evidence
to unseat this idea. We know for a fact that storms lead to increased creation of ozone. It
is both possible and probable that occasionally, in certain areas, there might be more than a
relationship between the ozone and oxidizable miasma in the atmosphere, and that the oxidizable
miasma cannot be thoroughly demolished. Therefore, following the physiological impact and chemical
character of these miasma, the miasma would apply a pronounced action on the economy of the
fauna, and lead to disease among more of the individuals who inhale contaminated air. However many
experiments have shown that as a rule, air includes free ozone, though in highly varying proportion.
From this we can reach a conclusion that no oxidizable miasm that can exist in this air, in the same
way that no oxidizable miasm can exist in air containing even a hint of chlorine.

I am not sure if, as forwarded by Mr. Hunt and others, it is true
that when a pandemic, for example cholera, is underway, the ozone
lacks atmospheric air. when I was on the top of the wheel house, reflected
the taste of the writer of the book Revelation. "There shall be no more sea ". He wondered
and said.At that time, I came with a lurch.The Prophet himself put it bawled. At that time
there was darkness because night time.After sometime, we floated off because the tide was
on the flood.
When we visited an Eskimo Moravian station, we noticed that they are
very enjoying people.I feel more respect to them.

They were surprised by seeing my shining leather coat. They folded it and done more interesting
things with it and treat it as a new baby.
 Past the
garden is the great water highway of the metropolis, the princely Thames, with its congesting barges,
its flashing skiffs, and sweeping steamers. Amongst the dark, shady buildings, there's another
garden-plot, with a fountain continuously going; and yet another, a nice lawn, complete with paths
and flower-beds, on the rivers edge. There is an everlasting quietness to the garden of the
Middle Temple without any human disturbances like that of the Inner Temples. Seats are distributed
randomly throughout, and beautiful summer-houses invite to contemplation, but they do not have
any viewable inhabitance. A person is inclined to believe that the Benchers have tributed
this garden to the limited occupation of the deceased luminaries
of the law, as the garden on the opposite side is devoted to its living
oracles.

We will always pay respect as we pass through the place with its well-recognized tranquility
and its symbolic meaning.
On the right is a red building that is the glorious hall of the Middle Temple, with the carved
screen of oak taken from the Spanish Armada. The Templar eats his way to the bar through this
hall; but if he is not hungry for a meal of the likes, it is not needed that he should engulf more
than three, given that he pays for the whole fourteen. Right before the dials' hand that is
above the doorway is pointed to five, flocks of gentlemen rush through the labyrinthine paths
headed to dine. The students are provided with gowns in the robing-room, a minor term-fee must
be paid for this, and then, they are directed into the Hall. Now it is no longer order but
is more hectic. They table spacing is congested but still in a neat fashion; wax-lights glare
down upon the tablea; many gowned men take up the seats or are conversing in groups, or trying
to find the best spots to dine upon, which they claim by placing the spoon in the plate. When
a loud thump comes from the door, everybody rushes to their seats, the servants line up on
the sides, and the benchers come in to their appointed spots. The steward hits his hammer to
the table three times to order silence preceding grace and then the
feast begins.

Rank is closely observed. 'The benchers' tables are ranged upon the dais, across the hall.
The tables in the middle of the hall are arranged lengthwise, the barristers are at the tables
closest to the dais, and all the others are filled with students. Each table contains messes
for four and each is mess is more than plenty in itself.
 To traders these belonged, they were the same
building plan as ours the only difference were the flat bottoms,
and were only used for merchandise transportation.

Two to three feet rising above the deck is elaborately decorated stern, which is also the
helmsman's seat. Merchandise fills the interior of the boat, with adequate room below for
two to three families--children, women, and men, who unselectively make their dwelling place
there.
 It is the charm, precisely, resignation is the charm of
serenity - serenity of an old revolutionary who no longer expects victory in the morning, however,
is secure in his confidence of ultimate success, and more insurance in the goodness of their
cause.  "A hundred times in life," he says, "how good you do seems to serve no immediate
purpose, and yet remains one way, another tradition of good intentions and do good, without
which all is lost. " Early in his career compared with her Shelley. In its latest phase, which
reminds us more of the authors of Far from the Madding Crowd and The Mill on the Floss, and
of Wordsworth, once also a torch of the revolution, making his Michaels and leeches and collectors
his Peter Bell.

           His exquisite images
          of pastoral life are idealizations of it; representations
          of peasants have not been supported by Zola, the last
          one on the shield of human nature from the side of gold.
          But for her at least she has found a real secret of
          happiness in the life of the field, quiet work and a
          proper attention towards his own heart and conscience.
          
          It's around this point in his spiritual development that
          she turns to Gustave Flaubert - maybe a bit apprehensive
          at first, but determined from the beginning, according
          to their natural instincts and principles already established,
          to encourage the belief in their admirable qualities.
          Writing from Nohant in 1866 Croisset him, outlining
          the distinction as a woman
          and as the author of this playful departure: "Sainte-Beuve,
          who loves you, however, claims that is terribly vicious.
          
          But perhaps he sees with his eyes a little dirty, as
          he learned botanist who wants the germander is of a
          dirty yellow.
          The observation was so false that I could not stop writing
          outside his book. " You, whose eyes are dirty "  
We
          talked about George Sand as a faithful daughter of the
          French Revolution, and on the contrary, we speak of
          Flaubert as a disgruntled son of the Second Empire.
          Among his literary appearance and it is an interval
          of a generation, in which the proud spirit and aspirations
          expansive grand given to the nation by the first Napoleon
          was reduced to a spirit of mediocrity and bourgeois complacency in
a Napoleon who had inherited nothing big its predecessor, but its
name.  
This change in time, the spirit can help explain the most
significant difference between Flaubert and George Sand. He inherited
the taste and imagination of the great romantic generation, but he
inherited none of his political and social enthusiasm. He was punished
by the Romantic writers, however, his reaction to the literary culture
of his youth is not ethical but aesthetic, but is inspired by Rousseau
less than Chateaubriand. He is bred for the admiration of eloquence,
poetic expression, the splendid picture, life in the grand style,
with disgust every time you are entering a society that feels, neither
understands nor values of any of these things and threatening its
destruction.
