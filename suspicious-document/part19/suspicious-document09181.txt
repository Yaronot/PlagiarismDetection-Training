The occupants of the room on the evening in question were four in number.  One, a German, known
as the Professor Heinrich von Schalckenberg, was half buried in the recesses of a huge arm-chair,

  Sir Reginald Elphinstone was already there; and after a few words of
greeting the two men left the club together, and, entering the baronet's cab, which was in
waiting, drove away to the banker's, where the business of the money transfer was soon concluded.

The pair then separated; and for the next fortnight the professor was busy all day, and during
a great part of the night, with his drawings and calculations.  At the end of that time, having
completed his work on paper to his satisfaction, he took advantage of a fine day to make a
little excursion.  Proceeding to London Bridge, he embarked in a river steamer, about ten o'clock
in the morning, and indulged himself in a run down the river.  He kept his eyes sharply about
him as the boat sped down the stream; and just before reaching Blackwall he saw what he thought
would suit him.  It was a ship-building yard, "for sale, or to let, with immediate possession",
as an immense notice-board informed him.  Landing at the pier, he made his way back to the
yard, and, having with some difficulty found the man in charge of the keys, proceeded to inspect
the premises.  They turned out to be as nearly what he wanted as he could reasonably hope to
find, being very spacious, with a full supply of "plant," in perfect working order, and with
enough spare room to allow of the laying down of the special "plant" necessary for the manufacture
of his new metal.  Having satisfied himself upon this point, he next obtained the address of
the parties who had the letting of the yard and works, and proceeded back to town by rail.
The parties of whom he was now in search proved to be a firm of solicitors having offices in
Lincoln's Inn; and by them, when he had stated the object of his call, he was received with--figuratively--open
arms.  The premises had been lying idle and profitless for some time; and they were only too
glad to let them to him upon a two years' lease upon terms highly advantageous to him and his
client the baronet.

This important business settled, the next thing was to lay down the special plant already referred
to; and so energetic was the professor in his management of this and the other necessary preliminaries
that six months sufficed to place the yard in a fit state for the commencement of actual operations. 

She name the feeling is one of event towards him tasted, sympathy for his short-plundered of confidence
that the Government will deal moreover and quarterly with all. As for the revoke of Organization!
Pshaw! Every bairn cognize that it is a notion was excessively absurd gentlemen of be long form

The opinion has had, from this Throne to their time, and the property of possible and vast countenance

opinions, is however general girl upon the Mr; in tsuris, whether really or low, a disgust is

At three o'clock on the following Monday afternoon the voyagers met in the smoke-room of the
"Migrants'" as a convenient and appropriate rendezvous, and, without having dropped the slightest
hint to anyone respecting the novel nature of their intended journey, quietly said "Good-bye"
to the two or three men who happened to be there, and, chartering a couple of hansoms, made
the best of their way to Fenchurch Street railway station, from whence they took the train
to Blackwall. On emerging from the latter station they placed themselves under the guidance
of the professor, and were by him conducted in a few minutes to the building yard. "of fortune had pronounced

 The sides of the
ship from stem to stern formed a series of faultless curves; the conical bow or fore body of
the ship being somewhat longer, and therefore sharper, than the after body, which partook more
of the form of an ellipse than of a cone; the curvilinear hull was supported steadily in position
by two deep broad bilge-keels, one on either side and about one-third the extreme length of
the ship; and, attached to the stern of the vessel by an ingeniously devised ball-and-socket
joint in such a manner as to render a rudder unnecessary, was to be seen a huge propeller having
four tremendously broad sickle-shaped blades, the palms of which were hollowed in such a manner
as to gather in and concentrate the air, or water, about the boss and powerfully project it
thence in a direct line with the longitudinal axis of the ship.  Crowning the whole there was
a low superstructure immediately over and of the same length as the bilge-keels, very much
resembling the upper works of a double- bowed vessel such as are some of the small Thames river
steamers.  This was decked over, and afforded a promenade about two hundred feet long by thirty
feet wide.  And, lastly, rising from the centre of this deck there was a spacious pilot-house
with a dome-like roof, from the interior of which the movements of the vessel could be completely
controlled.  The entire hull of the vessel, excepting the double-bowed superstructure, was
left unpainted, and it shone like a polished mirror. It found, slowly, they change them put, had been

Series, is not be the milder.
  The first sensation of
those who now visited this apartment for the first time was disappointment.  The room, though
full of machinery, was small, absurdly so, it seemed to them.  So also with the machinery itself.
The main engines, consisting of a pair of three- cylinder compound engines, though made throughout
of aethereum, and consequently presenting an exceedingly handsome appearance, suggested more
the idea of an exquisite model in silver than anything else, the pair occupying very little
more space than those of one of the larger Thames river steamers.  The impression of diminutiveness
and inadequacy of power passed away, however, when the professor informed his companions that
the vapour would enter the high-pressure cylinder at the astounding pressure of five thousand
pounds to the square inch, and that, though the engines themselves would only make fifty revolutions
per minute, the propeller, would be made, by means of speed-multiplying gear, to revolve at
the rate of one thousand times per minute in air of ordinary atmospheric pressure.

"But how on earth do you manage to get your vapour up to that tremendous pressure?" asked the
colonel.

"Oh!" answered the professor, "that is a mere matter of mixing. According to the proportions
in which the crystals and the acid are mingled together, so is the pressure of the vapour."

"And how do you mingle them together?" asked the lieutenant.

  Is not this the moment to
which we have all been anxiously looking forward for more than two years?  Proceed, professor,
we will follow you; and whatever orders you may give us shall be obeyed to the letter."

"Come, then," said the professor; and he led the way through the dining saloon and up the grand
staircase to the lower compartment of the pilot- house, and thence out on deck.

To their eyes, fresh from the brilliantly lighted saloons, the night appeared intensely dark;
but in a minute or two, becoming accustomed to the gloom, they were able to perceive that the
ladder had been taken away from the ship's side, and also that the contractor had completed
his task of removing the planking at the river end of the shed, thus clearing a way for the
exit of the great ship.  They walked to the after extremity of the deck, and from that point
were not only able, in the breathless stillness then prevailing, to distinctly hear the gurgle
and rush of the river, but also to dimly make out the shining, swirling surface of the water
as the flood-tide swept past them.

"The air is absolutely motionless," said the professor.  "No more favourable moment could possibly
have been chosen for the difficult task of moving the Flying Fish out of her present cramped
quarters, and we will at once avail ourselves of it.  Lieutenant, I will ask you to return
here presently on the `look-out,' as you sailors term it.  Your duty will be to see that when
we move out of the shed we do not come into collision with anything.  Perhaps you, colonel,
will kindly go to the other end the deck, also on the `look-out;' and, as for you, Sir Reginald,
I must ask you to stand on the deck just outside the pilothouse, to see that the electric lamp
on the top of it does not come into collision with the roof-timbers, and so drag the roof off
the shed. But as it is necessary that you should all become acquainted with the working of
the ship, you had better be with me in the pilot-house until we are actually ready to move."

A breathless pause of perhaps two seconds followed, and then the professor, his forehead damp
with nervous perspiration, heard:

"Hurrah!  She's away!" from the lieutenant.

"She moves; she moves!" from the colonel.

And, "By Jove, she is actually moving!" from the baronet.

Slowly but surely the Flying Fish backed out of the building-shed, until nearly half her immense
length projected beyond the walls. 52. Oxygen. 53. Element. Roentgen. ROBINSON. 54. SHIELDS.

  Let us walk round the heap; we may see something of
interest before we have completed the circuit."

And so they did, though the interest was hardly the kind of which the professor had been thinking
when he spoke.  For, whilst standing on the opposite side of the heap, contemplating the remains
of an ancient and grass-grown wreck, they were startled by the appearance of a sharp snake-like
head with a pair of fierce gleaming eyes which was suddenly protruded from a gap in the ship's
side, and in another moment the creature--a conger-eel of truly gigantic proportions--emerged
from its hiding-place, and, possibly attracted by the brilliancy of the electric lights which
the party carried, swam boldly toward them.

"What a horrible monster!" ejaculated the colonel, at the same moment that Lieutenant Mildmay,
struck with the savage look of the creature, exclaimed:

"Why, I believe the brute means to attack us!"

"And, by Jove, here come some more of them!" exclaimed the baronet, pointing to the hole from
which the creature had emerged.

"Draw your daggers, gentlemen!" shouted the professor.  "And be not dismayed; they and our
armour are quite sufficient for our protection."

It was perhaps just as well that the professor had sufficient presence of mind at that moment
to say what he did; for his companions, though their courage had been proved a thousand times
before, were now in a new and strange element to which they had scarcely had time to accustom
themselves; and, moreover, the aspect of the fierce fish as they rushed forward with open jaws,
disclosing their formidable teeth, was sufficiently weird and uncanny to at least momentarily
dismay the stoutest heart.

Lieutenant Mildmay's anticipation as to the intentions of the fish proved quite correct.  On
they came, some thirty or forty in number; and before the attacked could quite recover from
their confusion they found themselves fairly in the clutches of the snake-like creatures. 
The attack was made with the utmost determination and ferocity, the eels twining themselves
so powerfully about the bodies of their foes that it was almost impossible for the latter to
move hand or foot; whilst the sharp teeth rasped strongly but ineffectually against the scales
of the aethereum armour.  The fight, however, though fiercely waged on the part of the assailants,
was soon over, a single stroke of the keen double- edged dagger--as soon as the assailed could
get their hands free-- proving sufficient to instantly destroy the individual fish upon which
it happened to fall.  But so fierce were the eels that the conflict ended only with the slaughter
of the last of them. "bitthead, you is done to maintain rais you." cardinal, of what do he had not

That it did so was ultimately demonstrated, the professor himself being the first to make its
discovery.

The wreck, when first sighted, was distant about one hundred yards on their starboard hand,
and only just within range of the circle of electric light.  The ship's head was at once turned
in that direction, the engines being at the same time stopped, to permit of a very gradual
approach.

All eyes were of course intently fixed upon the strange object; and they had neared it to within
about one hundred feet, when Lieutenant Mildmay exclaimed in a low, awe-struck voice:

"Just as I suspected!  It is the Daedalus!"

"Yes," replied the professor very quietly; "it is that most unfortunate ship.  And now, gentlemen,
with your permission I will anchor the Flying Fish, and pay a visit--unaccompanied--to the wreck."

It was evident, from the extreme gravity of the professor's demeanour, that his proposed visit
was prompted by some other motive than that of mere idle curiosity; his companions therefore
simply bowed in token of acquiescence, and permitted von Schalckenberg to follow undisturbed
the bent of his own inclinations.

The Flying Fish, meanwhile, had been caused to descend to the bottom, to which she was at once
secured by her four grip-anchors; immediately after which the professor, with a somewhat hurried
and incoherent apology, left his companions and descended to the diving-room.

Left to themselves, the trio occupying the pilot-house had ample leisure to note the position
and surroundings of the ill-fated steamer.

She had settled down upon a flat ledge of level rock, and rested, keel downwards, in a perfectly
upright position, having apparently recovered herself whilst settling down.  She was greatly
damaged, both in hull and rigging; the spar-deck and forecastle being swept away, and her main
deck blown up in midships, very possibly through the explosion of her boilers.  Her bowsprit
and mizzen-mast were gone, as was also her fore topmast; and the mainmast, with topmast and
all attached, was leaning aft, and so far over the side that the observers would not have been
surprised to see it fall at any moment. Withdrawal. A loins, he will have nothing newer. That'appeared

  He carried in his hand a small compact
package, which he deposited carefully on the sideboard, and then, with a much more cheerful
mien than he had worn when setting out upon his solitary journey, took his accustomed place
at the table, apparently quite prepared to do full justice to the meal which was about to be
served.

The soup and fish were discussed in silence; a glass of wine was then imbibed with much apparent
enjoyment, and this unlocked the professor's lips.

"I feel it to be due to you, gentlemen--and more especially to you, Sir Reginald--to offer
some explanation of the motive which influenced me in my proposal that we should come hither,"
he remarked, setting his wine-glass down on the table.  "I had a threefold object in view.

 This set the professor's brain to work,
and by nightfall he succeeded-- with the aid of a second barometer having a small piece of
highly magnetised steel floating on the top of the mercurial column, and a couple of magnetised
steel bars--in constructing a somewhat rude but thoroughly efficient apparatus for automatically
maintaining the ship at any desired height, unaffected by the movements, be they few or many,
of those on board.

By the time that this apparatus had been fixed, and subjected to the test of an hour's conscientious
walking fore and aft the deck by the entire party, the dinner-hour had arrived, and they retired
below with such appetites as only a day's exposure to the tonic effects of a sea- breeze--minus
all uncomfortable motion--could produce.  The fullest justice was consequently done to the
meal, after which they made their way once more to the deck, and there, under a brilliant star-lit
sky, gave themselves up to the soothing influence of the weed and the renewed enjoyment of
their novel position.  Midnight found them quite ready for their state-rooms, and at that hour
they accordingly retired; the professor first of all, as a matter of precaution, increasing
the ship's altitude to four thousand feet above the sea-level, and then paying a visit of inspection
to the engine-room.  Matters were found to be all right there; the engines were working smoothly
and noiselessly, the bearings were quite cool, and the automatic feed was doing its work to
perfection.  The ship, then, being at such a height as to be clear of all danger, and steering
herself in the required direction, with all the machinery in perfect working order, the weather
also being fine and wearing a settled aspect, von Schalckenberg told himself that there was
not the slightest necessity for the maintenance of a look-out, and he therefore also retired.
A quarter of an hour later the whole of the crew were sunk in profound repose, and the Flying
Fish, left to herself, was leisurely wending her way northward at a height of nearly a mile
above the earth's surface.

The first of the quartette to put in an appearance on deck next morning was the professor,
who was awakened just as day was breaking by the faint sound of a steam whistle.  Springing
hastily from his very comfortable couch, he rushed up the companion way and into the open air,
without even pausing to don his nether garments. Man, they was to set he convey them were, they are
done, them had been thickly, her secured it enfeeble them were excited by bottom, they are attended

It was decided over the breakfast-table that morning, that the journey northward should be
prosecuted, as far as possible, upon the surface of the sea; and the Flying Fish was accordingly
put in motion on the required course immediately upon her descent.  Their rate of progress
was particularly slow, not exceeding, on the average, a speed of six miles per hour, as drift
ice was remarkably abundant, mostly in small detached blocks, though they occasionally encountered
a floe of several acres in extent; and, far away to the northward, quite a large assemblage
of bergs were seen.  This slow rate of progress would have been wearisome to a veteran Arctic
navigator in possession of such means for the accomplishment of a quick passage as those enjoyed
by the inmates of the Flying Fish's pilot-house; but to them everything was novel and interesting,
and, almost before they knew it, they found themselves in the immediate vicinity of the bergs.
These varied greatly in size, some of them being no larger than a dwelling-house of moderate
dimensions, whilst others fully equalled, if, indeed, they did not exceed, the proportions
of the monsters seen on the previous evening. They were grouped so closely together that a
passage between them seemed to be not wholly unattended with danger; and the party were in
the act of discussing the question which channel it would be most prudent to take, their eyes
being meanwhile fixed on the huge towering cliffs of ice before them, when a gigantic overhanging
mass was seen to detach itself from its parent berg and plunge, a distance of some two hundred
and fifty feet, with a terrific splash into the water and disappear. The deep thunderous roar
of its plunge smote the ears of the watchers next moment, and they looked on with breathless
interest to see what would follow.  The mass, from its enormous size, would weigh, they considered,
fully five thousand tons; and they were not surprised to see that the loss of so much weight
had seriously disturbed the balance of the berg, which at once began to rock ponderously to
and fro, creating a terrific commotion in the water when conjoined with that caused by the
plunge into the sea and the reappearance a second or two later of the detached mass.  The sea
was seen to heap itself up in a long well- defined ridge, similar--though, of course, on a
tremendously magnified scale--to that caused by the plunge of a stone into the water. Betwixt yellowwood,

the windlass and two more round the heel of the foremast, the eye of the hawser being further
secured by tackles to every ring-bolt in the ship capable of bearing a good substantial strain;
and then, the skipper himself going aloft to the crow's-nest, the signal was given for the
Flying Fish to go ahead.

CHAPTER TEN.

THE "HUMBOLDT" GLACIER.

The two ships were at this time floating in a tolerably broad expanse of open water; but at
a distance of some seven miles ahead the pack-ice stretched, apparently unbroken, across their
track for miles.  The skipper of the whaler, however, shouted down to them from his elevated
perch the intelligence that a somewhat intricate but continuous channel extended through this
ice in a northerly direction as far as the eye could reach.  Toward this channel, then, away
they went at a speed of something like sixteen knots per hour, the barque with her string of
colours still fluttering bravely in defiance of the adverse gale, and the Flying Fish with
the white ensign of the Royal Yacht Squadron, of which Sir Reginald was a member, streaming
from her ensign staff in honour of little Florrie.  It was a strange sight, even in that region
of fantastic phantasmagoria, to see the two ships, one of which, moreover, wore such an unaccustomed
shape, dashing rapidly along through the black foam-flecked water, with ice in every conceivable
form heaped and piled around them, and their bright-hued flags fluttering against the dark
and dismal background of a stormy sky; and the skipper of the whaler possesses to this day
a spirited water-colour sketch of the scene, executed on the spot by the colonel, which he
exhibits with becoming pride whenever he relates the story of his wonderful escape from the
threatening icebergs.

Half an hour later they entered the channel through the ice.  Narrow and tortuous at first,
it gradually widened out, and, after a journey of some fourteen or fifteen miles, turned sharply
off in a direction almost due west.  About the same time the gale broke, the sun made his appearance
through the rifted clouds, and by seven o'clock that evening, at which hour Florrie's father
duly put in an appearance on board the Flying Fish, the engines having been temporarily stopped
to receive him, they found themselves in open water, or rather in a straight channel some twelve
miles in width and entirely free from ice, with a clear sky overhead, a light easterly wind
blowing, and the evening sun lighting up the snow-clad peaks of the extensive island called
North Devon.  An hour later, dinner having been postponed on account of their near proximity
to the land, the two vessels entered a commodious natural harbour called Hyde Bay, and anchored
there for the night, in order to give the whaler's exhausted crew an opportunity to snatch
a few hours of much-needed rest.

The master of the Walrus, who answered, by the way, to the name of Hudson, though only a bluff
hearty seaman, and somewhat shy for the first half-hour or so in such unaccustomed company
as that of his four well-bred easy-mannered entertainers, gradually thawed out under the genial
influence of the baronet's champagne, and proved himself a tolerably well informed and by no
means disagreeable companion. You being nearly, according to ship, they might be to let minute,

And look at the edges of the blocks; they are rounded and worn away by the constant abrading

unnumbered years.  It is no wonder that this is a lifeless solitude; there is nothing here
capable of sustaining the life of even the meanest insect.  Let us return to the ship, my friends,
and hasten over this part of our journey; we shall meet with nothing worthy of interest until
we reach the Pole, which itself will probably prove to be merely an undistinguishable spot
in just such a waste as this."

The professor was, however mistaken; a most interesting discovery awaited them at no very great
distance ahead.  They returned to the ship oppressed with a vague feeling of melancholy foreboding
for which they could not account, but which was doubtless attributable to the gloomy cheerless
aspect of their surroundings, and, releasing the ship from the hold of her grip-anchors, resumed
their way northward at the Flying Fish's utmost speed.

Half an hour later, however, they suddenly checked their flight and diverged a mile to the
eastward of their former course to examine an object which Mildmay's quick eye had detected. National for

  The highly-compressed air, however, held her securely down
upon her icy bed, and, beyond imparting an occasional tremor, as already mentioned, the tempest,
fierce as it was, had no power to move her.

In such terrible weather it was of course useless to think of pursuing their investigations;
it would, indeed, have been the sheerest madness to have attempted to face the furious gale,
with its deadly cold and the blinding whirling snow.  The travellers were therefore compelled
to spend an inactive day.  For this, however, they were by no means sorry; they had been keeping
rather late hours since entering the Arctic circle, and this interval of inaction afforded
them an opportunity of securing their arrears of rest.  Besides this there were sketches to
complete, and a thousand little odd matters to attend to--to such an extent, indeed, that when
they once began work they wondered at their own thoughtlessness in not having attended to them
before.  Thus employed, with occasional interludes of meditative gazing out upon the ceaseless
whirling rush of the snow, the day passed rapidly and pleasantly away, wound up by an hour
or two of vocal and instrumental music after dinner.  They retired early to their warm comfortable
state- rooms that night, and were lulled to sweet dreamless slumber by the howling of the gale
outside.

The four following days were spent in the same manner--the gale lasting all that time with
unabated fury, accompanied by an almost ceaseless fall of snow.  But on the fifth day the weather
moderated; the snow ceased, or at all events fell only intermittently; the wind backed round
and blew from the south-west; and the exterior temperature, which during the gale had fallen
to thirty-three degrees below zero, rose twenty degrees.  The sky was still overcast and lowering,
it is true, and the cold was still intense. Audacious travel would have been make, the last the damsels,

glorious spectacle of an open Polar Sea!"

Whether it actually was an open sea, or only an unusually wide channel between two ice-fields,
was now the question to be settled.  It certainly looked like the former; it was completely
free of floating ice, large or small, except the cakes which were broken away by the waves
from the edge of the enormous floe just left behind, and they were kept by the wind close to
their parent mass; the sea ran so high and was so regular as to convey the idea of a very considerable
extent of "fetch;" and, lastly, there was neither ice nor ice-blink to be seen anywhere along
the whole stretch of the northern horizon.

 That the country was
not absolutely tenantless they soon had abundant proof, for they had not advanced more than
half a mile before an Arctic fox was discovered gliding rapidly away before them.  A little
further on they came unexpectedly upon a herd of moose-deer.  The behaviour of these animals--naturally
extremely shy--conclusively proved that they had never before met such an enemy as man, for,
instead of bounding rapidly away, as is their wont, they merely ceased feeding for a moment
to stand and gaze curiously upon the new-comers, and then went on browsing again with the utmost
composure.  Their fearlessness offered a strong temptation to such inveterate sportsmen as
Sir Reginald and the colonel; but not being in actual need of their flesh, and being, moreover,
anxious not to disturb them just then, the party passed quietly on without firing a shot. 
A huge brown bear was the next animal encountered, and this time the baronet's love of sport

The worthy professor was so excited that he could scarcely hold the binocular firmly enough
to look through it, and it was really laughable--to his companions--to hear his "Ach's" and
"Pish's" of impatience as he vainly strove to steady his trembling hands and get another good
look at the herd of hitherto believed extinct monsters, which were quietly feeding at a distance
of about two miles away.  At length he, with a comical gesture of despair, restored the borrowed
binocular to Mildmay, and, turning to his companions, exclaimed in a voice of feverish earnestness:

"Come, my dear friends, why do we stand idly gaping here and wasting valuable time, when we
really have not a moment to lose?  We may never have such a priceless opportunity again.  Let
us press forward, then, and at all risks secure a specimen of so unique an animal as the mammoth.
If we were to achieve this and nothing more our success would be ample repayment for all the

  Their first impulse was to beat a precipitate retreat;
their second, to go forward; for at only a few yards' distance before them the rift closed
altogether, except at the very bottom, where a low cavern-like fissure dimly appeared.  A hasty
consultation passed between them, resulting in a determination to go forward and explore the
fissure.

Fortunately for their purpose they had, at an early stage of their difficulties, provided themselves
with a couple of stoutish pine branches--wrenched from their parent stems and hurled into the
ravine perchance by some winter storm--to aid them in surmounting the difficulties of the way,
and these they now determined to utilise if possible as torches.

With some little difficulty the smaller ends of these brands were induced to kindle; but, once
fairly ignited, they blazed up bravely, and thus provided with the necessary lights the adventurers
boldly pushed forward and plunged into the recesses of the fissure.

CHAPTER THIRTEEN.

AT THE NORTH POLE.

The opening was so low and so narrow, that for the first fifty or sixty feet the explorers
were I obliged to creep forward on their hands and knees; then it widened and became gradually
higher, so that by the time they had penetrated a couple of hundred feet they were able to
resume a perpendicular attitude.  The cavern, if such it could be called, still however remained
so narrow that it was only here and there possible for them to walk side by side.  It was also
very tortuous; and the heights varied momentarily, at one time compelling them to stoop almost
double in order to pass beneath some immense projection, and anon increasing so greatly that
the light of their torches failed to reach and reveal the roof.  They observed several rifts
or crevices to the right and left of them as they pressed forward, but, with one or two exceptions,
these were quite impassable, and those which were not so were still so cramped that they offered
no inducement to deviate from the main passage.

Groping thus in semi-darkness over painfully rough and broken ground, a full hour was spent,
and the colonel was just expressing his conviction that they must have traversed a distance
of fully two miles when a faint glimmer of daylight revealed itself on one of the rocky walls
of the passage; and, turning sharply round an angle, the pair suddenly found themselves once
more within a few yards of the open air.

Emerging into broad daylight a most wonderful spectacle greeted the two adventurous explorers.
They found themselves standing on a narrow strip of coarse sandy beach at the bottom of an
immense basin, measuring fully a mile in diameter, the sides of which were formed of lofty
precipitous cliffs of volcanic rock, so smooth and so nearly vertical that nowhere, at least
in their immediate neighbourhood, could they discover a spot capable of being scaled. Contact, appearance,

The position having thus been accurately determined, the next thing was to mark the spot.

With this object a large triangle was first described about it, and a point was carefully marked
off on each of its sides in such a position that a line tightly strained from such point to
the opposite angle of the triangle would pass directly through the pole.  This done, an excavation
six feet deep in the solid rock was made, and in its bottom was deposited a tightly-sealed
bottle containing a small parchment scroll, on which was inscribed a brief statement of the
circumstances connected with the discovery of the spot, with the date, and the signatures of
the joint discoverers.  This bottle was carefully packed in and buried up with small fragments
of rock, and made finally secure by a covering of excellent concrete, the materials for compounding
which had been carefully and with infinite labour prepared by the professor. Then, when the
concrete had become properly hardened, a substantial flagstaff of aethereum was stepped into
the hole in a position accurately corresponding with the North Pole of the earth, and also
made secure by being built in or "set" in concrete, which completely filled the hole. "them is

Precisely at half-past four o'clock the Flying Fish took the water about two miles to the eastward
of the "Noman" fort, and her occupants at once began the search for a suitable berth for her--a
berth, that is to say, in a position where she would not be likely to be discovered by the
fishermen, and where the depth of water would be sufficient to permit of the largest man-o'-war
passing over her submerged hull without striking upon it.  To discover such a spot proved by
no means an easy task; but it was accomplished at last, though at a distance considerably farther
out to sea than they had bargained for, and at half-past five o'clock her anchor was let go
in the selected berth.  Cross bearings were then most carefully taken and entered in each of
the travellers' pocket-books, after which the next task was to get their varied spoils into
the boats and the boats themselves into the water.  This was soon done, and then all hands,
including George and the chef, but excluding the professor, entered the boats and shoved off
a few fathoms from the ship's side, where they anchored.

The first faint signs of dawn were just appearing in the eastern sky when it became apparent
to those in the boats that the huge bulk of the Flying Fish was disappearing.  Steadily but

On the fourth day of this part of their journey, shortly after effecting their morning's start,
they came within sight of an immense lake; and a slight deviation from their prescribed course
was made in order that a thorough examination of it might be effected.  A long range of hills,
which had been sighted on the previous day, lay on their left hand; and, on clearing the southern
spurs of these, they found that another large body of water lay beyond or to the eastward of
them; a river connecting the two lakes, afterwards identified by them as lakes Albert Nyanza
and Tanganyika.  Rising in the air to a height of about ten thousand feet, they slowly traversed
the latter from its northern extremity, reaching its widest part--which they estimated to be
about sixty miles across--at mid-day.

And here a most exciting scene presented itself.  An hour previously a dark mass had been sighted
near the western shore of the lake, which mass had at first been taken for an island; but,
on a nearer approach, the supposed island had resolved itself into an immense fleet of canoes,
in number about three hundred, manned by from four to twenty men in each, rapidly making its
way toward the western shore.  So large a concourse of craft, coupled with the fact that the
crews were elaborately "got up" with paint, feathers, and skins, and were well provided with
bows and arrows, spears, shields, and clubs--to say nothing of a few very antiquated-looking
muskets which the travellers' glasses revealed here and there--seemed to point to the conclusion
that a hostile expedition was afoot, or, rather, afloat; and the explorers resolved upon a
temporary pause in order to watch the course of events.

The natives were so intent upon their paddling that--facing forward as they all were, with
the Flying Fish somewhat in their rear and nearly a mile above them--not one of them seemed
to have detected the near vicinity of the aerial ship; and the fleet diligently pursued its
course landward, the short broad-bladed paddles moving to the time of a deep, sonorous, but
somewhat monotonous song, which, issuing as it did from the throats of probably quite two thousand
warriors, was distinctly audible on board the Flying Fish, and really had quite an impressive
effect.

The flotilla had reached within about four miles of the shore, and of a tolerably extensive
native settlement built thereon on both sides of a river which at that point emptied itself
into the lake, when a sudden confused beating of drums and blowing of horns seemed to indicate
that the menaced tribe had at last become awakened to the unpleasant fact that an invasion
of their territory was imminent. Wood (comical) Consomme are once.

offered no temptation for loitering or dalliance, and the speed of the ship was accordingly
increased to about sixty miles an hour over the ground, the pace being maintained until two
o'clock in the afternoon, when a low range of rocky precipitous hills was reached, beyond which
fertility and life once more resumed their sway.  The travellers computed the stretch of desert
over which they had passed as being fully three hundred miles in extent, and they could therefore

  But if not, king
and people would be very severely punished for the insult offered to their potent visitors,
"and," continued the professor, "in order that Lualamba might see for himself that, in making
this threat, they were indulging in no mere empty boast, he would give the chief and his followers
a single specimen of their power."

Mildmay having, during the progress of this conversation, received a hint from the professor
how to act, had quietly, and as if not particularly interested in what was going forward, sauntered
off to the pilot-house, where, stationing himself at the engine and other levers controlling
the movements of the ship, he awaited further instructions.

The professor, having promised to give the savages a specimen of their visitors' power, now
waved his right hand very slowly and impressively skyward, as a signal to the watchful Mildmay,
loudly exclaiming as he did so:

"Lualamba will now accompany the four Spirits of the Winds to yonder cloud," pointing, as he
spoke, to a single small white fleecy cloud which was floating at the moment across the sun's disc.

Dexterously manipulating the various valves, Mildmay caused the Flying Fish to rise with a
gentle and almost imperceptible motion from the earth.  So gentle was the movement that Lualamba
was utterly unconscious of it, and it was not until some seconds had elapsed that he fully
realised what was happening.  The savages below, however, no sooner heard von Schalckenberg's
exclamation than, to their inexpressible horror, they beheld the huge structure, round which
they were standing, lift itself off the earth without the slightest visible effort and begin
to rise into the air.  Many of them were so overpowered by astonishment that they could only
stand, open-mouthed and as motionless as statues, staring at the extraordinary sight; others,
however, remembering the stringent orders of the king, and feeling that the prize which they
had believed to be so secure was not only escaping them but also carrying off one of their
number, rushed forward, and, whilst some fruitlessly attempted to grasp and hold the smooth
and polished hull, others seized and clung tenaciously to the rope-ladder.  The weight of some
seven or eight natives clinging to the dangling ladder had, of course, no visible effect upon
the movement of the great ship; and, finding themselves being helplessly dragged skyward, they
let go their hold with a yell of dismay when they were some four or five yards from the earth,
upon which they dropped back heavily.

The ship once fairly off the ground, Mildmay increased the rarefaction of the air in the air-chambers
to an almost perfect vacuum, and the immense structure soared skyward with great rapidity. They,

The colonel, glancing round for a good background against which to place himself, noticed a
large clump of trees with olive-green foliage growing at a short distance directly astern of
the ship.  Against these his white-clad figure would stand out in strong relief.  He accordingly
stepped leisurely out to a suitable position on the deck, and, with one hand in his pocket
and his smouldering cigar in the other, patiently awaited the decisive moment.  M'Bongwele
in the meantime snatched a bow from one of his followers, and, selecting a long straight arrow
from the sheaf, retired to the other end of the deck, a distance of about one hundred and fifty
feet from his living target.  He strung the bow carefully, adjusted the arrow to the string
with the utmost nicety, drew it to the head, and then paused for a full minute, apparently
waiting for some indication of flinching on Lethbridge's part.  In this, however, he was disappointed,
not the faintest suggestion of uneasiness could be detected in the colonel's face--indeed,
he seemed to be absorbed in a critical contemplation of the smoke which lazily wreathed upward
from the end of the cigar.  Suddenly the bow twanged loudly, the arrow whizzed through the
air, and, striking fair upon the rosette, fell in splinters to the deck.  Lethbridge somewhat
contemptuously kicked the fragments aside, unpinned the rosette from the breast of his coat,
and sauntered back to his former seat.  The group of chiefs gathered on the deck glanced at
each other and uttered suppressed ejaculations of dismay. Pilot were being wholly.

  The radiance grew stronger and stronger, and presently an immense
circular disc of light appeared reflected on the slowly-rising cloud of vapour, in which a
host of forms were indistinctly traceable.  Another moment and a loud ejaculation of astonishment
burst from the savage spectators, for, with another sudden brightening of the luminous disc
there appeared the phantom presentment of M'Bongwele's troops drawn up as they had appeared
a couple of hours before, when the king had first boarded the Flying Fish So clear and vivid
was the representation that it met with instant recognition, amid loud murmurs of amazement
from the beholders; the king being quite as strongly moved as any of his subjects.

"Do you recognise the vision?" demanded the professor sternly of M'Bongwele.

"I do, I do.  Those are the spirits of my bravest soldiers," murmured the king.  "Truly the
Spirits of the Winds have wondrous powers."

The posting of the guard having been effected to Lualamba's satisfaction, he entered the palace
to make his report to the king, who was anxiously expecting him.  M'Bongwele listened attentively
to all the details of the capture, and, upon its completion, rose and, accompanied by the chief,
made his way to the hut, which he cautiously entered, placing himself at the foot of each hammock
in succession, and long and anxiously regarding the countenances of the sleepers.  He had been
successful in his bold enterprise beyond his most sanguine hopes; but it was evident that even
in the very moment of his triumph he was anxious and disturbed in his mind.  He trembled at
the audacity which had led him to pit himself against these extraordinary beings, and the very
ease with which he had accomplished his purpose frightened him.  Had these men--if men they
were--been encountered and overcome awake, and in the full possession of their senses, he would
have been happy, for he would then have felt that his own power was superior to theirs.  But
they had been surprised whilst under the influence of a subtle and potent drug prepared by
the chief witch-doctor; and when they awoke and discovered what had been done to them, what
might not the consequence be?  But what was done was done; he had now gone too far to retreat;
besides which, his ambition overmastered his fears, and he determined to go on and risk the
consequences.

Having obtained possession of the persons of these formidable beings, obviously the next thing
would be to secure that wonderful thing which they called a "ship;" and this M'Bongwele determined
to do at once: who knew but that its possession might give him a much-needed and decisive power
over its former owners?  He accordingly retired from the prison hut, and gave orders for the
immediate assembling of all his available cavalry; at the head of which he soon dashed off
in the direction of the ruins, leaving Lualamba in charge of the guard and of the prisoners,
a position of responsibility which that chief by no means coveted, and which he accepted with
much inward perturbation.

Proceeding at a gallop, the impatient M'Bongwele and his troopers soon reached the Flying Fish,
which they immediately surrounded.  The king then dismounting, and summoning some fifty of
his most famous braves to follow him, cautiously approached the ship, with the purpose of boarding
her.  But the rope-ladder, by means of which he had on a former occasion accomplished this
feat, was no longer there; and, as he glanced upward at the gleaming cylindrical sides of the
towering structure, it began to dawn upon him that the task he had undertaken was, after all,
not without its difficulties.  Presently, however, a brilliant idea occurred to him, and, selecting
a dozen men, he gave them certain orders which sent them scurrying off at a gallop.  Half an
hour later they returned, dragging behind them two long stout bamboos and a considerable quantity
of tough pliant "monkey-rope" or creeper.  With these materials the men, under M'Bongwele's
instructions, proceeded to construct a ladder, which, when completed, they reared against the
side of the ship; and by this means the king and his fifty chosen warriors ascended and triumphantly
reached the deck.

M'Bongwele now regarded himself as completely successful; he had gained possession of the wonderful
structure; and all that remained was to make use of it in a similar manner to that of its former
owners.  He accordingly advanced pompously to the gangway, and ordered his troopers to first
remove the ladder from the ship's side, and then return to the village with all speed, adding
exultantly that he and those with him on the "flying horse's back" would be there long before them.

Seating himself jauntily upon one of the bedsteads, he opened the negotiations by explaining
that he had come to express his admiration of, and his thanks for, the wonderful manner in
which the woman had been saved from the deadly effects of the snake-bite; and then, without
affording an opportunity for interruption, he went on to state, in full detail, his further
business.

The indignation excited in the breasts of his listeners by the cool impudence of the king soon
subsided under the influence of the interesting news that four white women were captives in
the village; and when M'Bongwele closed his explanation and proffered his request, the professor,
instead of loading his captor with reproaches, followed the latter's example of ignoring all
cause for unpleasantness, and simply stated that no promise of any kind could be made until
the four friends had been afforded an interview with the afflicted women.  To this proposition
the king eagerly assented, overjoyed at so unexpected a measure of success, indeed he volunteered
to personally conduct the quartette into the presence of his female prisoners; but this was
promptly negatived, the professor declaring that if he and his friends went to see the women
at all they must go entirely unattended, and at such time as might be most convenient to themselves.
It would have suited M'Bongwele very much better to have been present at this interview, for
he was suspicious to a really absurd degree; but, finding the white men firm upon this point,
and, apparently, wholly indifferent in the matter, and being also unable to discover any cause
for suspicion in their conduct, he at length yielded his assent and retired, giving the necessary
instructions to the guard as he passed out of the hut.

  Poor M'Bongwele was now completely
at a loss; he knew not what to do.  He was most anxious to have the white women cured; but
he had a powerful presentiment that if those singular beings, whom he certainly to some extent
had in his power, once again set foot upon that curious thing they called a "ship," his power
over them would be gone for ever.  And in such a case he felt that his fate was certain; he
had laid unholy hands upon them, and dire would be his punishment.  No; he was convinced that
at all costs they must be debarred from access to that terrible "ship," unless he could first
of all gain their forgiveness, amity, and good-will, and interest them in his fortunes to the
extent of securing their active co-operation in his schemes of conquest and aggrandisement.
How to do this was, however, the question which puzzled king M'Bongwele; and it puzzled him
so long that--but stay, we must not forestall the story.

Thus engaged in a futile endeavour to discover a way out of his dilemma, the king kept himself
strictly secluded in his palace day after day, allowing no one access to him unless upon business
of the utmost urgency and importance.  Meanwhile, Seketulo, deeming the period a favourable
one for the furtherance of his own schemes, first exhibited an increased amount of precaution
in the proper posting of the guard over the prisoners, and then a gradually growing disposition
to converse with the prisoners themselves.  From this he proceeded to develop an interest,
which, after a suitable lapse of time, was allowed to merge into anxiety for their welfare
and greater comfort, and, finding these cautious advances well received, he then set to work
in real earnest upon the delicate task of unfolding his proposals.  He was so very cautious,
however, and took so long a time about this, that he missed his opportunity altogether, and
that, too, through a very simple accident.

at length came to the conclusion that there was no hope of his getting to sleep until he had
taken a turn or two up and down the compound, in the comparatively cool night air.

  Eight and left of them stretched the vast mountain chain of the
Himalayas, their wooded slopes and countless peaks and cones presenting a bewildering yet charming
picture of variegated colour, sunlight and shadow, as they dwindled away on either hand until
all suggestion of local colouring was swallowed up and lost in an enchanting succession of
increasingly pure and delicate soft pearly greys, which merged and melted at last into the
vague shapeless all-pervading purple-grey of the horizon.  Glancing immediately around and
beneath them their blood curdled and their brains whirled with the vertigo which seized them
as they peered appalled and shrinkingly down upon the sharp crags, the sheer precipices, the
steeply-sloping snow-fields with their lower edges generally overhanging some fathomless abyss,
the great glaciers, the awful crevasses spanned here and there by crumbling snow bridges--the
effect of the scene being heightened and intensified in its impressive grandeur by the deathlike
silence which prevailed, broken only by the occasional thunderous roar of an avalanche far
below.  The scene was absolutely fascinating in its appalling sublimity; but it was a relief
to turn the eye further afield until it rested to the eastward upon the grandly towering mass
of Everest's rival, snow-capped Kunchinjinga, which reared its giant crest aloft to a height
of twenty-eight thousand five hundred feet above the sea-level, and which, though it was eighty-five
miles away, appeared to be almost within rifle-shot.  And still more was it a relief to turn
the eye in an opposite direction, and to allow it to rest upon the glittering summit of Dhawalagiri,
which, at a distance of no less than two hundred and forty miles, gleamed faint and softly
opalescent out of the western haze.  And, lastly, to the southward of them they beheld the
fertile province of Nepaul, watered by countless tributaries to the mighty Ganges; and, beyond
it again, the still more fertile province of Oudh.  The professor, totally forgetful of his
exceedingly perilous position, was enthusiastically expatiating, after his usual manner, upon
the marvellous extent and beauty of the prospect, and interrupting the flow of his eloquence
at short intervals to assure his companions that a--to them--invisible object on the far horizon
must be the town of Patna, when a terrific crackling crash just below them drew the eyes of
the party in that direction, just in time for them to see the supposed projecting crag--in
reality an enormous mass of ice--which supported the snow-bank on which the Flying Fish rested,

at this point of their journey a gradual fall of the mercury in their barometers warned them
that they were about to experience a change of weather.  The atmospheric indications remained
unchanged, however, until about two o'clock in the afternoon, when the wind lulled, the mercury
experienced a sudden further fall, and a great mass of murky cloud began to bank up in the
south-western quarter.  This rapidly overspread the sky, until the whole of the visible heavens
became obscured by a thick curtain of flying scud.  The sea, inky black, suddenly became agitated,
and formed itself into a confusion of irregular waves without any "run," but which reared themselves
tremblingly aloft, and then subsided again, only to be instantly succeeded by others. Idiom. Saucepan,

 (as Elphinstone
was dubbed when he first entered the school), and the sorrowing girl was assured that, so far
from being friendless, she would find in her then companions four men upon whom she might always
rely for the warmest sympathy, the most kindly counsel, and the most substantial help so long
as their lives might last.

The accession of such a guest as Olivia D'Arcy to the little party on board the Flying Fish
occasioned, it will readily be understood, a complete and immediate change in all their plans.
In the first moment that they gave to the consideration of the matter they saw that it would
never do for a young, beautiful, and unprotected girl to accompany them hither and thither
in their wanderings, even were she willing to do so, which they felt well assured she would
not be.  Two alternatives then presented themselves to the choice of the party: the one being
to land her at the nearest port, and, furnishing her with the necessary means, leave her to
make her way to England alone and unprotected as best she could; the other alternative involving
the temporary abandonment of their further projects and the immediate return of the Flying
Fish to England.  The first project was named only to be abruptly and unanimously rejected
by the entire party, the second being gladly adopted by Sir Reginald upon his receiving from
his three friends the assurance of their hearty approval and acquiescence.

This decision was arrived at shortly before midnight on the evening following Olivia's formal
introduction by the professor to the remaining members of the party, and thereupon--the Flying
Fish being at the time afloat and making her way leisurely southward toward the Straits of
Malacca--an ascent to the upper regions of the atmosphere was at once made, and the ship's
head pointed homeward.  The distance to be traversed was considerable, but it was calculated
that by travelling at the ship's utmost speed along the arc of a great circle (the shortest
possible route between any two places on the earth's surface), the journey might be accomplished
in about forty-five hours, which, allowing for the difference of longitude in time between
their then position and the English Channel, would enable them to reach the latter place at
about two o'clock in the afternoon of the day but one following. When a form as them shouts the
