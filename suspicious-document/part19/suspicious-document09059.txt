V. 11.--John "beheld another beast,"--therefore not the same, as many expositors strangely
suppose. No one can have an intelligent understanding of this chapter unless he views the beast
of the sea and the beast of the earth as perfectly distinct. As the former arose out of a revolutionary
state of society, and was consequently more clearly marked in history, so the latter grew "up
out of the earth" more quietly and gradually, like a spear of grass,--we "know not how." As
this second beast of the Apocalypse is to act a prominent part in the scenery afterwards presented
in vision to the apostle, and a correspondent part in actual history, and as it is called by
different names and appears under different aspects, it is necessary that its character be
closely inspected, so that its identity may be clearly ascertained. The description here given
is very minute. One thing is very obvious,--that this beast of the earth is the confederate,
the ally, and the accomplice of the beast of the sea. They act in concert. They had been thus
represented in vision to Daniel. In the seventh chapter of that prophecy we have the beast
of the sea, as here, with his "ten horns," (v. 7.) While the prophet narrowly "considered the
horns, behold, there came up among them another little horn," (v. 8.) It has been already shown
that these horns represent the kingdoms into which the Roman empire was divided, (v. 24.) Among
these horns, kings, (v. 24,) or kingdoms, "another shall rise after them,"--"among them," yet
in the order of time,--"after them." Thus it appears that Daniel's fourth beast had eleven
horns; but the eleventh is called "another which came up," to distinguish it from the ten,
(v. 20.) "He shall be diverse from the first," (v. 24.) It is thus evident that the last horn,--the
eleventh, is as really a horn of the beast, as the other ten; and of course this horn,--"little"
at its rise, but in time becoming "more stout than his fellows," is the willing accomplice
in crime of that beast whose horn it is. "The same horn made war with the saints, and prevailed
against them," (v. 21.)--"He had two horns like a lamb." He professed to be gentle and innocent
as a lamb,--to be the vicegerent of the "Lamb of God." He claimed only a spiritual jurisdiction.
As it is natural that a lamb should have only two horns, so the symbol is agreeable to nature.
But this lamb "spake as a dragon;" and that was contrary to nature. No two animals in creation
are in their respective natures more diverse or opposite than a lamb and a beast of prey. These
two antagonistic natures combined, indicate the crafty and cruel policy of this beast of the
earth. Daniel mentions the "little horn" of the civil beast; but says nothing of the "two-horned
beast." On the other hand, John speaks plainly of this beast of the earth, but omits any mention
of the "little horn." But the "beast of the earth" and the "little horn" sustain the same relation
to the first beast, the "beast of the sea"--the Roman empire; therefore the "two-horned beast
of the earth" and the "little horn" are identical; and this identity is confirmed by the additional
name "false prophet," given to the beast of the earth in ch. xix, 20. His alliance and co-operation
with the civil beast is precisely the same as in this chapter. He "wrought miracles before
him," that is,--in his interest. Some interpreters have mistaken this "false prophet" as a
symbol of Mahometanism. The facts of history demonstrate the fallacy of this interpretation;
for the delusions of Mahomet never had, and they have not now, any affinity with the idolatries
of the Latin Roman empire. But these two beasts of the sea and of the earth are obviously in
the closest sympathy, having a common interest.

V. 12.--The second beast "exerciseth all the power of the first beast before him,"--in his
presence, under his sanction and powerful protection. Thus the state, or empire, lays the church
under obligation, and of course expects a reciprocity of kind offices. This is effected by
the beast of the earth "causing the earth--to worship the first beast." By force and craft
this is accomplished. By his "two horns" of power, the regular and secular orders of the hierarchy,
as from the mouth of a "dragon," he enjoins "submission to the (civil) powers that be." But
besides the horns of power, that is, ecclesiastical authority, this beast of the earth, in
order more effectually to enforce his commands to worship the first or civil beast, resorts
to "great wonders,--miracles," (vs. 13,14,)--"lying wonders;" (2 Thess. ii. 9:) for Paul and
John agree in their description of the same diabolical agency. "As Jannes and Jambres withstood
Moses,--magicians doing so with their enchantments,"--"beguiling unstable souls," so this second
beast "maketh fire to come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of (credulous) men."
(2 Tim. iii. 8; Exod. vii. 22; Acts viii. 9-11.) The venal ministry of the heathenized church,
(ch. xi. 2,) inculcate passive obedience to the beast of the sea, as to the "ordinance of God;"--to
"resist" which, subjects the recusant to "damnation." (Rom. xiii. 2.) Here, then, we behold
the counterfeits of the two great ordinances of church and state, against which it is the special
duty and arduous work of the two witnesses to contend for 1260 years. This "false prophet,"
who "spake as a dragon, and made fire to come down from heaven," to authenticate his divine
mission, may represent the bulls, anathemas, interdicts, encyclical letters, which emanate
from Rome, together with the less terrifying mandates of her coadjutors,--"daughters." And
deceiveth them that dwell on the earth, by the means of those miracles which he had power to
do in the sight of the beast; saving to them that dwell on the earth, that they should make
an image to the beast which had the wound by a sword, and did live.

Vs. 13-17.--This lamb-like beast of the earth devises another agency, by which to subserve
his own diabolical interest, as well as that of the "first beast." He causes to be made "an
image" to or of the beast of the sea. Of images in general, as objects of idolatrous worship,
we are warranted to say,--they are dead and dumb idols; (ch. ix. 20; Jer. x. 14:) but this
one is altogether different. And it is surprising to find learned expositors fixing upon the
superstitious use of the cross by the papists, as exemplifying this symbol. The Holy Spirit,
as if to guard all readers against such misapprehension, declares explicitly, that this image
has "life, speaks," and acts. The only point in which this image resembles others is, that
it is to be worshipped: but of all others we are assured that they "cannot do evil," (Jer.
x. 5.) This image has such "life," (breath,) and power as to cause the death of such as refuse
to worship itself. Three agents are to be noticed and clearly distinguished here,--the ten-horned
beast of the sea, the two-horned beast of the earth, and the image of the beast. At the instance
of the second beast, an image is made; not to or of himself, but to, and also of, the first
beast. Now, as the beasts put forth their power by their horns, so this ecclesiastical beast
of the earth makes the image by his horns. In short, history explains the symbols. The Roman
clergy,--the horns, the cardinals, create the Pope; and, in their own ceremonial and language,--quem
creant, adorant, "whom they create, they adore;" like all other idolaters. Thus, the Pope becomes
the "man of sin, sitting in the temple of God, showing himself that he is God," (2 Thess. ii.
4.) The Pope is the most perfect image of the Roman emperor; claiming the same universal dominion,
the same titles and prerogatives, in the same city: but the Pope and the emperor never identify.
They are always distinct. Two authoritative measures are to be specially noticed in this connexion;
one by the beast of the earth, the other by the image of the beast of the sea. The image demands
worship under pain of death. All heretics are judged worthy of death. All are required by the
second beast to receive the mark of the first or civil beast. The penalty in this case is privation
of civil and political privileges,--to "buy or sell." It is to be noticed here that the "mark"
is imposed by the authority of the ecclesiastical power, the two-horned beast. As there is
liability to mistake as to which of the two beasts the "mark" refers, and as this mistake is
in fact generally made by expositors, the apostle John has been directed, as in the case of
the image, to be peculiarly explicit, that all may know it to be the mark of the first beast.
(See chs. xv. 2; xix. 20; xx. 4.) But it will be asked,--What are we to understand by the "mark?"
This question is easily answered from history. The heathen idolater gloried in his devotion
to his imaginary god; as the ivy leaf was the token of the worshippers of Bacchus: soldiers
bore the initials of the names of their commanders; and slaves, of their masters. These characters
were impressed on the foreheads or other part of the persons of individuals. The general idea
suggested by the "mark" was subjection or property. In short, the mark of the beast signifies
open and avowed allegiance to antichristian or immoral civil power, when in the "forehead;"
and active co-operation with the same, when in the "hand." It is at once a pitiable and culpable
error, to suppose, as many preposterously do, that this "mark of the beast" is popery! And
as the "mark" is the recognised badge of loyalty to civil rule, of course the prohibition to
"buy or sell," must signify civil disabilities,--disfranchisement. Men who suffer, necessarily
feel. Christ's witnesses, as they only have the scriptural conception of the rights of man,
have long been familiar with the deprivation of their rights, both civil and ecclesiastical.
The moral evils incorporated in the constitutions of church and state, throughout all the streets
of mystic Babylon, have effectually excluded the two witnesses, and left them in the "wilderness."
Here is their destined "place," and here they are to be "nourished from the face of the serpent"
for 1260 years. Christ's promise,--"I will not leave you comfortless," (orphans,) is all along
verified in their soul-satisfying experience.--This will appear in the next chapter.

18. Here is wisdom.

V. 18.--"The name of the beast," since the time of Ireneus, the disciple of Polycarp, who was
cotemporary with the apostle John, is understood to be Lateinos, or Lateinus; for it is well
known to scholars, that classical usage justifies the orthography of this word. However learned
men may indulge their fancy, and sport with this mystic and sacred name and number, no other
word fills up all the conditions required by the inspired writer. Latinus is the proper name
of the "first beast," the Latin empire: it is the name common to the whole population of the
empire, the Latins: it is the name of the founder of the empire, Latinus; and it contains the
number, 666. The probability that this word contains the requisite name and number, amounts
almost to a certainty. The unlearned reader may be easily taught to understand how to "count
the number of the beast." Of course, the apostle John accommodated his expressions to the custom
of his own age. Well, even children soon learn to number or count by the use of Roman letters
of the alphabet. They know that the letter I, stands for one; V. for five, etc. Now, in the
apostolic age, the Jews, Greeks and Romans, were accustomed to express numbers by the use of
the letters of their respective alphabets. This we suppose to be the only rational and probable
method of solving the mystery.

In this chapter we have the fullest exhibition of the great antichristian confederacy, spoken
of by prophets and apostles, including the "man of sin, to be revealed in his time." The component
parts of that complex moral person called "Antichrist," are here graphically portrayed. The
three most prominent features are the two beasts of the sea and of the earth, with the image
of the first; or, a tyrannical empire, an apostate church, and the Pope. To suppose that the
Antichrist is a power or moral person distinct from these,--a "wilful, infidel or atheistical
king," is a mere chimera framed in a learned brain, disordered by antichristian politics. The
chief, if not the only ostensible ground of such hypothesis is the language of our apostle,
(1 John ii. 22.) "He is Antichrist that denieth the Father and the Son." The sound of the words
of Scripture is too often mistaken for the sense. This is a notable example. From the words
of our Divine Redeemer,--"My Father is greater than I, Socinians infer the essential inferiority
of the Son to the Father. So in the preceding instance. The inference is, that the Antichrist
is to be known by a doctrinal denial of deity. But the very name of this enemy of all righteousness,
Antichrist, demonstrates his recognition of the existence and office of our Saviour. For why
should he oppose a nonentity? All scholars are aware that the primary meaning of anti, is substitution.
(Matt. xx. 28.) Antichrist usurps Christ's place in church and state, that he may more successfully
oppose his interest. There is no mystery to the intelligent Christian in the declaration, that
men too often "profess that they know God, but in works deny him." This explains the fact of
Antichrist's denying the Father and the Son. Usurping the prerogatives of the Mediator is a
practical denial of him,--of his authority, and by consequence, of the Father who sent him.
"He that acknowledged the Son," in this sense, "hath the Father also; while it is equally true,
in the same sense,--"whosoever denieth the Son, the same hath not the Father." (1 John ii.
23.) Hence it is not true that the Pope is the Antichrist of prophecy, nor the church of Rome,
nor both combined; but Daniel's ten-horned beast,--John's seven-headed, ten-horned beast, which
are the same: Daniel's little horn and John's beast of the earth, which are the same; together
with the image of the first beast: the Saracenic locusts and Euphratean horsemen;--all these
go to the composition of the Antichrist, the "eastern and western Antichrist," so identified
and familiarly designated by the martyrs and witnesses of Jesus for hundreds of years. The
great family of nations, called "the nations of this world," (chap. xi. 15;) in unholy alliance
with a gentile church; (ch. xi. 2;) these combined, constitute the Antichrist. They "will not
have this man to reign over them." Against this combination it is the appointed business,--the
life of the two witnesses, to prophesy for a definite period of 42 months, 1260 days, time,
times and a half; all indicating the same duration, 1260 natural years. All this time the witnesses
are alive and active, but in an obscure and depressed condition, wearing sackcloth in the wilderness,
"not reckoned, (not reckoning themselves,) among the nations." (Num. xxiii. 9; Dan. vii. 22,
27; Rev. xx. 4.) Such is the condition of the saints, and such the powerful combination against
them, as symbolically represented in the 11th, 12th and 13th chapters of the Apocalypse. (Exod.
iii. 3.) The Lord was in the bush, and "greater is he that is in them than he that is in the
world." (1 John iv. 4.) This will appear in the following chapter.

CHAPTER XIV.

As the 13th chapter contains the most full and graphic description of the great apostacy, so
in this chapter we have the other party described which protested against that apostacy. It
is a concise history of the two witnesses in holy and happy fellowship with Christ, when he
had rejected the heathenized church, because of her unholy league with the beast of the bottomless
pit, (ch. xi. 2, 7.) The contrast between the "sealed" ones here, and those who bore the "mark
of the beast," is very noticeable. This fact suggests that the parties are cotemporary. Besides,
it is evident that this company of 144,000 are the legitimate successors of those sealed in
ch. vii. 4-8; or rather, from the perpetual identity of the covenant society as a moral person,
we may view this company as the same with the sealed ones of the seventh chapter, the two witnesses
of the eleventh chapter, and as in the wilderness in the 12th chapter. Political bias caused
a learned expositor to interpret the third angel of this chapter as a symbol of the prelatic
church of England! and a similar bias, or modern charity, induced another to distinguish between
the "two witnesses" and the 144,000. To the unbiased and enlightened mind it is obvious that
instead of the 144,000 symbolizing the "pious people,--in the different branches of the Christian
church"--all true Christians; they are in fact distinguished from true Christians, as 144,000
from "a great multitude ... who had washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of
the Lamb," (ch. vii. 9, 14.)

As the Antichrist, after his first development in the world, appeared in diverse forms of organization,
thereby more effectually to deceive them that dwell on the earth, yet still preserved his moral
identity, so the faithful servants of Christ are presented in corresponding attitudes and aspects,
to oppose and counteract his diabolical policy and tyranny; yet always preserving their proper
identity during the whole period of 1260 years.

The process of "sealing the servants of God in their foreheads," (ch. vii. 4-8,) took place
under the sixth seal before the opening of the seventh, (ch. viii. 1,) which introduced the
trumpets,--the harbingers of the visible organization of Antichrist. For this purpose the "four
winds,"--all winds, emblematical of popular commotions, were by four angels restrained from
blowing upon the earth etc., during the peaceful reign of Constantine and his successors. Under
the patronage of those nominally Christian emperors, as history informs us, multitudes flocked
into the church; "the number of immoral and unworthy Christians began so to increase, that
the examples of real piety and virtue became extremely rare.... The virtuous few were oppressed
and overwhelmed with the superior numbers of the wicked and licentious."[6] Thus the way was
prepared for the visible appearing of the "man of sin,"--the papacy. So soon as the confederate
hosts of the dragon are completely organized, the two witnesses take their position with the Lamb.

1.

V. 1.--While "all the world wonders after the beast," (xiii. 3,) and the gross senses of the
multitude are preoccupied with that object; here is another presented more worthy of our contemplation.
Often has the Lord Jesus appeared in vision to John while viewing the grand panorama passing
before him in Patmos. Here he appears as the "captain of the Lord's host" at the head of his
army; not indeed in active military enterprise, but rather as leader in acts of solemn worship
during a temporary recess from sanguinary warfare. He and his associates are on the "Mount
Zion." "In Zion is his seat." ... "The Lord hath founded Zion, and the poor of his people shall
trust in it. (Is. xiv. 32.) This select company maintain fellowship with Christ, being "really
and inseparably united to him as their Head," by the bond of the Spirit, on his part, and faith
on theirs. Christ's "Father's name in their foreheads" indicates that they are the property
and voluntary servants of God in Christ. Of this covenant relation baptism is the visible sign;
but while Simon Magus may bear the sign, none but those who are "sealed unto the day of redemption,"
are honored to "stand with the Lamb on Mount Zion." To him their number is as accurately known,
as one hundred and forty-four thousand is to us; and "truly their fellowship is with the Father
and with his Son Jesus Christ." The votaries of the beast may either glory in bearing his mark
in their foreheads, or conceal the mark in their right hand; but the followers of the Lamb
will "confess him and his word before men," at the hazard of all that is dear to men,--even
life itself. (Mark viii. 38.)

2. And I heard a voice from heaven, as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of a great
thunder: and I heard the voice of harpers harping with their harps:

3.

Vs. 2, 3.--"Let the children of Zion be joyful in their King.... Let the high praises of God
be in their mouth."--(Ps. cxlix. 2, 6.) Unterrified by the roaring of the beasts of prey, these
followers of the Lamb lift their voices in unison; and whether on mountains or in valleys,
in dens or in caves of the earth, their songs of praise ascend to the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth.
The symphony is heightened by the "voice of harpers, harping with their harps." And if any
person be so ignorant as to ground an argument on these words, for the use of instruments in
the worship of God, consistency will require him to take his position on the literal Mount
Zion with a literal lamb!

The song was new. It was not peculiar to the Mosaic economy; that, like it, was to "wax old
and vanish away."--(Heb. viii. 13.) No, it was indited by the Holy Spirit, "to whom all hearts
are known, and all events foreknown." It was a song exactly framed to answer the twofold end
of all inspired songs--to display the glories of the Godhead, and delineate the workings of
grace and corruption with infallible precision, neither of which can be even successfully imitated
by the best of uninspired men; much less by the licentious debauchees--the slaves of Antichrist.
Moreover, the order of worship, as here exemplified, merits special attention, The 144,000
perform this solemn service "before the four beasts, and the elders." The office-bearers, appointed
by the Lamb--the Lord Christ--direct the whole solemnity. Among this joyful and holy company,
there is no hint that any part of public worship is left to "a vote of the congregation." This
"new song" was unintelligible by the votaries of the beast; nor could they learn it while in
that servile vassalage. They only who were "redeemed from the earth," as well as "from among
men," were capable of learning it. As this song related to the royal prerogatives of Jesus
Christ, and those who "dwelt on the earth" had transferred their allegiance to Antichrist,
they became thereby incapacitated for learning that song. Alas! how many complain of the cloudiness,
the Jewish peculiarities, the unforgiving, revengeful spirit of the inspired Psalms! In their
apprehension, they are "contrary to the spirit of the gospel"--that is, the Holy Spirit is
contrary to Himself! O, the blasphemy! Can such learn the "new song?" No, indeed, unless they
repent and "pray God if perhaps the thought of their heart may be forgiven them."

4. These are they which were not defiled with women; for they are virgins. These are they which
follow the Lamb withersoever he goeth.

Vs. 4, 5.--These 144,000 worshippers are farther distinguished by their chastity. Betrothed
to the Lord Christ from eternity, they were married to him in time. (Hosea ii. 19, 20; Rom.
vii. 4; Cor. xi. 2.) Indeed the marriage covenant is employed throughout the Bible, to shadow
forth the union between Christ and believers. (See Is. liv. 5; Jer. xxxi. 32; Hos. ii. 2; Rev.
xxi. 2) This analogy pervades the 45th Psalm and the Song of Solomon. Idolatry is therefore
adultery; and superstition, will-worship and human inventions, as means of grace or of communion
with God, are fornication. (Ezek. xxiii. 27.) Accordingly, the "kings of the earth" are charged
with this crime, (ch. xviii. 3.) Hence, it is plain that this company with the Lamb are such
as do not receive or "teach for doctrines the commandments of men," nor submit to a "voluntary
humility and worshipping of angels, (Col. ii. 18,) "for they are virgins." (Ps. xlv. 14.) They
are distinguished for "sound doctrine and the power of godliness." "A man that is a heretic,
after the first and second admonition," they "reject." (Titus iii. 10.) They cannot be indifferent
to truth and error; and they may be known by their love for practical, but especially doctrinal,
preaching. They frequent the ministry of those who "give attendance to reading, to exhortation,
to doctrine." (1 Tim. iv. 13.)

"These follow the Lamb." (John x. 4, 27.) Next after self-denial, taking up the cross, becomes
the test of discipleship. (Matt. xvi. 24, 25.) Suffering is the most trying and most difficult
part of a Christian's obedience. But mere suffering for one's religion is no evidence that
his religion is scriptural. Nor is punishment endured for religion persecution; but suffering
"for righteousness' sake, or for Christ's sake," is persecution. And this is what is implied
in "following the Lamb whithersoever he goeth." Not suffering, but the cause for which he suffers,
makes a Christian martyr. All these 144,000 are martyrs in principle and intention.

Besides, "these were redeemed (bought) from among men." Purchase supposes contract,--a price
fixed and paid. This ransom is both from debt and crime,--from bondage, sin and penalty. The
Lamb is their surety. With his blood he "redeemed them to God," (ch. v. 9; 1 Pet. i. 19.) An
atonement which does not reconcile, a redemption which does not save, must be an atonement
and a redemption without a compact. Hence the covenant of grace, and Christ's engagement as
surety in that covenant, determine the extent of the atonement; for without compact no sinner
could be saved! But such is the liberal doctrine of the boasted Roman Catholic Church, and
such the sandy foundation of that "general and doubtsome faith" which the witnesses renounce.
However numerous these followers of the Lamb may seem to be, they are no more than "the first
fruits." But the first fruits are part of the coming harvest, and an assured pledge of a larger
ingathering. Their numbers were to be greatly augmented by the Reformation, and still further
in the millennial era.

"Godly sincerity" is the last quality of these upright ones. They are "Israelites without guile."
Integrity, probity, candor, distinguish them from the "flocks of the companions" by whom they
are surrounded. "As they think in their heart, so do they express the truth." (Ps. xv. 2; xii.
2; John i. 47.) They know nothing of the "pious frauds" any more than the "indulgences" and
"supererogations" by which the "man of sin" sustains his interest. Their being "without fault
before the throne of God," is the highest commendation possible; yet it does not imply sinless
perfection. It speaks their justification by the righteousness of Christ, and their Christian
sincerity, such as God testifies of Job, (ch. i. 8.) Who would not prefer the society and employments
of those who are with the Lamb on Mount Zion, to dwelling in the tents of wickedness? Let our
delights be with these excellent ones of the earth.

Vs. 6, 7.--The apostles, Paul and John agree, as already noticed, in delineating a great defection
from the purity and power of Christianity in "the last days." Paul calls this event "the Apostacy,"
(2 Thess. ii. 3.) while John designates it "the Antichrist." (1 John ii, 22.) Both these inspired
writers use the Greek article, as may be supposed, to emphasize that wicked confederacy of
Church and State,--a confederacy of greater extent and longer continuance than any other conspiracy
"against the Lord and his Anointed." Against these the saints of God, with Messiah at their
head, contend for the allotted period of 1260 years, as we have seen in the three preceding
chapters. On their part the warfare is mostly defensive, and their weapons ordinarily spiritual.
(2 Cor. vi. 6, 7.)

From the 6th verse to the close of this chapter are presented, under customary and well-defined
symbols, three successive stages of successful reformation, showing how the "two witnesses"
manage their scriptural and effective testimony against antichristian error and disorder in
organized society. Three mystic "angels" successively appear, divinely commissioned to execute
their respective and appointed work. These angels have been correctly designated, by judicious
expositors, "angels of revival and reform." To the intelligent Christian it will be obvious,
that without reform there can be no revival. The popular idea of our time connected with the
term revival, is without foundation in the Holy Scriptures. It does not mean the regeneration
of a sinner, nor the first work of the Spirit in conviction. It presupposes the existence of
the vital principle, and the bringing of that living principle into visible activity, (Rom.
vii. 9;) and this is equally true, whether of an individual or moral person. (Ps. lxxxv. 6;
Ezek. xxxvii.) Divine truth and external order are characteristics of a genuine revival: for
nothing but "sound doctrine" can produce "the power of godliness." The popular commotions and
social disorders which accompany modern revivals, render them highly suspicious, if they do
not demonstrate them to be spurious. It is true, indeed, that passionate declamation, vociferous
assertion of heresy, intensified by theatrical and violent gesticulation, may commove to a
higher degree the active powers,--the passions of the sinner; but such appliances can generate
only a temporary faith. Such converts, "having no root in themselves, wither away." (Mark iv.
6.) "God is not the author of confusion, but of peace, as in all the churches of the saints."
So these angels of reform declare by their ministry.

The first of these angels is the recognized symbol of a gospel ministry, (ch. i. 20; ii. 1,
8, 12, etc.) "Heaven" is the visible church general. "Flying" indicates celerity of motion.
This "angel" does not represent any individual, as Luther; but the collective body of those
who carry the joyful message of "the everlasting gospel." This gospel is everlasting as distinguished
from "another gospel, which is not another" (Gal. i. 6, 7, 8, 9,)--a spurious, counterfeit,
and therefore ephemeral gospel, invented and propagated by the "man of sin," from the flood
which issued from the mouth of the dragon, (ch. xii. 15) The gospel preached by this angel
is everlasting in its origin and duration. (Tit. i. 2; John iv. 14; Gal. vi. 8.) This angel's
commission is as extensive as that of the apostles,--"every nation;" his "loud voice" is expressive
of his zeal, energy and authority; the subject matter of his brief sermon indicates very plainly
that the object of his teaching is to counteract the heresies of the Romish apostacy. "Fear
God and give glory to him,"--not to the Virgin Mary, canonized saints and angels, images of
wood and stone, (ch. ix. 20.) All are solemnly warned to "abstain from pollutions of idols,"
and their attention earnestly directed to their Creator,--to him "who made heaven, and earth,
the seas and fountains of waters." This argument of the angel is very short,--that He only
is to be worshipped who created the universe; but it is sufficient to "leave all men without
excuse who do not glorify him as God." (Rom. i. 20, 21.) And how much more aggravated is the
guilt of professing Christians! But the "angel" employs another powerful argument to enforce
his teaching,--"The hour of his judgment is come." The final judgment of the last day is often
set before us in the Bible, and it is so even in this book; but the last judgment cannot be
intended here, for subsequent judgments are to be inflicted according to the messages of the
following angels.

That Charlemagne should be mistaken for this flying angel betrays an almost incredible hallucination
of the human mind![7] No individual, as already noticed, much less a successful civil or military
tyrant, can be intended by the Spirit as the herald of the "everlasting gospel!"

In fact, this "angel" is identical with the "two witnesses," whose special work is to oppose
the great apostacy; and this they do in a pre-eminent manner by proclaiming the everlasting
gospel. For 500 years those who are known in history by the name of Waldenses, kept the doctrines
and order of the apostles, in a state of separation from the Church of Rome. In the latter
part of the twelfth century their numbers and influence attracted the notice and brought upon
them the wrath of the "man of sin." In the following ages multitudes of them were subjected
to all the penalties of confiscation, banishment and death. Like the seed of Abraham in Egypt,
however, "the more they were afflicted, the more they multiplied and grew." They revived true
religion in the kingdoms of southern Europe, and it is most probable that the good seed sown
by them reached even to the island of Britain. John Huss and Jerome, who, by decree of the
council of Constance, were committed to the flames for heresy; and Wishart, in England, whose
end was similar, together with such as co-operated with them and succeeded them in the same
holy warfare, are to be viewed as answering to the mystic angel. These faithful and dauntless
men denounced divine judgments against all who worshipped graven images, however enjoined by
civil and ecclesiastical authority. For their fidelity to Christ and the souls of men, they
were subjected to the heaviest censures of the heathenized church, and the severest penalties
of a tyrannical state,--the beast of the earth and the beast of the sea always in unholy alliance
and acting in concert. The ministry of this angel is a testimony against papal corruptions,
such as the worshipping images of the Creator and creatures, but especially the Pope,--the
image of the Roman emperor. It is a mere fancy to suppose this angel symbolizes modern missions.
The series of the prophecy forbids such an interpretation. Besides, the idolatry of Rome Christian,
is not less real or gross than the idolatry of pagans, and calls for a more earnest testimony;
and God has never left himself without witnesses against defection and apostacy. This angel
prepares the way for his successor, who prosecutes the same work with increasing clearness
and confidence.

V. 8.--"There followed another angel." Some expositors[8] interpret this angel of Luther, some
of Calvin; but no individual is sufficiently prominent in history to justify the application
to him of so striking a symbol in so concise a prophecy. Such restriction of a symbol to an
individual results from prelatic habits of thought. In the mind of a prelate the idea of a
gospel ministry includes that of a metropolitan. This angel is, in fact, as usual, simply the
emblem of the ministry, not excluding the social body of which they are the official guides.

This second angel carries forward the reformation effected by his predecessor, reviving that
cause when it began to languish under the violence of Antichrist. "While the Roman pontiff,"
says Mosheim, "slumbered in security at the head of the church, and saw nothing throughout
the vast extent of his domain but tranquillity and submission, and while the worthy and pious
professors of genuine Christianity almost despaired of seeing that Reformation on which their
most ardent desires and expectations were bent, an obscure and inconsiderable person arose
on a sudden, in the year 1517, and laid the foundation of the long expected change, by opposing
with undaunted resolution his single force to the torrent of papal ambition and despotism."
That individual was the heroic Luther, whose praise is in all the churches till the present
day. No individual is so famous in the history of that eventful period as Martin Luther, for
recovering the doctrine of justification by the righteousness of Christ, to the exclusion of
all creature merit. This fundamental principle in the economy of man's salvation he justly
denominated articulus stantis vel cadentis ecclesiae--"the hinge of a standing or falling church." A babylon

The "angel coming out of the temple,"--represents the gospel ministry as usual. His "having
a sharp sickle" may import his more immediate agency in this than in the preceding work of
the harvest." Christ himself judged the nations,--had the "sharp sickle;" but in reckoning
with impenitent ecclesiastical communities, he will honor his faithful servants. As in "measuring
the temple,"--the Mediator held the instrument in his own hand under the Old Testament, (Zech.
ii. 1,) but under the New Testament gave it into the hand of John, the representative of a
gospel ministry, (ch. xi. 1,) so that transaction may illustrate the symbols here.

The other angel "coming from the altar, who had power over fire," is also symbolical of the
ministry. The sickle in the hand of the former angel, is for gathering the grapes; while the
connexion of the latter angel with the "altar," imports that a sacrifice is about to be offered,
as customary, to appease divine justice.--The "vine of the earth" is plainly contrasted with
the true vine. (Ps. lxxx. 1; Jer. ii. 21.) This is a vine of Sodom with clusters of Gomorrah,
(ch. xi. 8; Deut. xxxii. 32, 33.) It is the symbol of an apostate church, the chief heresy
of which is a practical rejection of the atonement of Christ; for it is certain that vindictive
justice is an attribute of God, and that he will demand satisfaction from those impenitent
sinners who despise his mercy in the gospel offer, and "tread under foot the blood of the covenant
wherewith Christ was sanctified." (Heb. x. 29.) A heavier doom awaits all such than to "die
without mercy," which was the penalty for those who "despised Moses' law." No sacrifice is
appointed for the man or the church that sins presumptuously. (Num. xv. 30, 31.) To all such,
"our God is a consuming fire." (Heb. xii. 29.)--The one angel calls upon the other,--encourages
his companion, to execute the judgment of God. "Thrust in thy sharp sickle."--Under the superintendence
of the Mediator, his servants by their prayers and their sermons have an active part in this
work of judgment. From the mouth of the witnesses proceeded fire to devour their enemies, (ch.
xi. 5.) This is the last work of judgment in which they will be honoured. Joining their victorious
predecessors who overcame the antichristian combinations "by the blood of the Lamb and the
word of their testimony," (chs. vi. 9, 10; xii. 11,) these undaunted servants of the Lord are
honored by him as instrumental in the infliction of the final judgments symbolized by the seventh
trumpet and the seventh vial,--the third and last woe.--The "wine-press" is the symbol of the
"wrath of God," and its location "without the city," denotes that the churches of the apostacy
are excommunicated,--"reprobate silver, because the Lord hath rejected them."

We are not told here by whom the grapes are trodden; but this is the work of the Lord Jesus
himself, who in the days of his flesh on earth forewarned his impenitent foes that he would
thus deal with them in his wrath. "Those mine enemies, which would not that I should reign
over them, bring hither, and slay them before me." (Luke xix. 27; Isa. lxiii. 3; Rev. xix.
15.)--The blood in depth is to the "horse-bridles," and in extent "a thousand and six hundred
furlongs,"--200 miles! 1; Rev. xiii. 8.)--Thus it appears that church and state, having combined
in the antichristian apostacy, are severally visited with the unmingled wine of the wrath of
God. All the saints shall have obeyed the call,--"Come out of her, my people;" and mystic Babylon
shall then be utterly destroyed. Whether Palestine, the Pope's patrimony, or some other territory
be understood by the "1600 furlongs," is matter of vague conjecture by all expositors, and
is to be verified only by the fulfilment of the prediction.

CHAPTER XV.

This chapter introduces the third and last series of symbols under which the prospective history
of the church militant is given, to strengthen the faith and animate the hopes of her suffering
and heroic children. The warfare of the witnesses for the crown rights of Immanuel, which have
been usurped by his enemies, has been symbolized under the seals, (chs. vi.-ix.,) and under
the trumpets, (chs. xi. xii.;) and the symbolic narrative is yet under the vials to be greatly
amplified, especially their last and greatest conflict, briefly represented in the latter part
of the preceding chapter, (vs. 9-18.) Whether or not the vials, to which this fifteenth chapter
is introductory, be all comprehended under the seventh trumpet, as the trumpets are all comprehended
under the seventh seal, is a question upon which respectable expositors differ. It is indeed
obvious that the breaking of the last seal, lays open the whole of the book, consequently the
angels holding the vials would come into view. John, however, is obliged to "write" consecutively
some visions which he saw as it were at one view. Thus he was "about to write what the seven
thunders uttered," (ch. x. 4,) but was prohibited. That was not the proper time or place; but
it is there intimated, (v. 7,) that "in the days of the voice of the seventh angel," the import
of the "seven thunders" would be disclosed. (Joel iii. 2, 12, 13; Micah iv. 3; Zech. xii. 2-4;
2 Thess. ii. 8.) Some of the most learned and sober divines, who wrote on the Apocalypse during
the peninsular war waged by the first Napolean, contemplating the anarchical and bloody scenes
of the French Revolution, and the subsequent tyranny and blood connected with the successful
wars of the Gallic usurper, thought they heard in the commotions of European nations the sound
of the seventh trumpet, and saw the plagues inflicted as symbolized by the vials. And thus
it is that local events, which excite the political feelings, the prejudices and partialities
of even good men, are hastily interpreted as a fulfilment of prophecy. It does not appear,
however, that those events were either of sufficient magnitude or geographical extent to answer
the tremendous symbols of either harvest or vintage. Did the French revolution, the American
revolution, or the wars of Napolean First, influence the civilized world or affect the church
of God, as Popery and Mahometanism have done? No, the comparison is preposterous. Hence it
is most probable that Christendom has not yet heard the alarming sound of the seventh trumpet.

1. And I saw another sign in heaven, great and marvellous, seven angels having the seven last
plagues; for in them is filled up the wrath of God.

V. 1.--"Another sign in heaven."--All the visions were seen by the apostle in the same place,
(ch. i. 1; xii. 1.) The word translated "sign" here is the same as "wonder" in the twelfth
chapter, which for greater clearness to the English reader ought to have been rendered by the
same word.--The symbol or sign consists of "seven angels having the seven last plagues,"--the
last to be inflicted on the Antichrist, but not absolutely the last penal inflictions on the
enemies of God; for "Gog and Magog" are in like manner to be destroyed, and there is eternal wrath.

Upon the "Lamb's taking the book," and before he had opened the first seal, songs of joy burst
forth from saints and angels, (ch. v. 8, 9.) So it is here. Before the angels proceed to execute
their commission, the redeemed of the Lord, anticipating the effects of these judgments, give
expression to their joy.

Vs. 2-4.--The "sea of glass," or transparent sea, (as in ch. iv. 6,) refers us to the brazen
sea before the throne of God in the temple. In this sea the priests were to wash themselves,
(Exod. xxx. 18, 19,) and in water drawn from it the sacrifices were to be washed also. (Lev.
i. 9, 13.)

As the brazen sea typified the blood of Christ, that "fountain opened for sin and for uncleanness,"
(Zech. xiii. 1,) so this "sea of glass" is the symbol of the same thing; for the Lord washes
away the filth of the daughters of Zion, and purges the blood of Jerusalem from the midst thereof
by the spirit of judgment, and by the spirit of burning. (Isa. iv. 4.) This happy company were
victorious by the blood of the Lamb, "over the beast, his image, his name and number;" having
clean escaped from them who live in error, both in civil and ecclesiastical relations. Holding
the eucharistic "harps of God," they are the same company as those on Mount Zion with the Lamb,
(ch. xiv. 1, 2.) There, their song was called new; here it is more fully described. There it
was said, "no man could learn that song" but themselves, here we have the matter of the song
epitomised. It is constructed of two parts, "the song of Moses and the song of the Lamb." As
the children of Israel at the Red Sea celebrated the praises of God's justice in the overthrow
of their enemies the Egyptians, so do these with united voice express their admiration and
praise in anticipation of the final and awful end of these cruel, idolatrous and persecuting
mystical Egyptians, (ch. xi. They do also declare their faith in the universal dominion of
their King; that "all nations shall come and worship before him." And to this day none but
the witnesses are prepared either with intelligence or affection to "learn" or use this song.
We have the subject matter of both parts of this triumphant song, framed by the Holy Spirit
and incorporated in the Book of Psalms, (as Ps. ii. 8; xviii. 37-45; xlv. 3-6; cx. 1, etc.)
The fortunes of God's covenant people till the ingathering of the Jews, with the fulness of
the Gentiles, may be found in Moses' song, (Deut. xxxii. 1-43,) and the "song of the Lamb"
is found in chapter v. 9-13.

5.

Vs. 5, 6.--John looked again, and saw the "temple opened," that the seven angels might have
egress to enter upon their heavenly mission. Their clothing resembled the garments of the priests
under the law, "white linen and golden girdles," representing the holiness or moral purity
of their work. They shed the blood of the victim, so to speak, without soiling their garments;
but the Lord Jesus, whose work of judgment this is, "stains all his raiment," (Isa. lxiii.

V. 7.--"One of the four beasts,"--animals, the symbol of the gospel ministry, as we found,
(ch. iv. 6.) Not all the ministry were employed in this action, but one only. That is, some
few, a fractional part, possessing more insight into the "sure word of prophecy," and endowed
with larger measure of heroic spirit by the Lord Jesus, co-operated with holy angels in this
work of judgment. "He gave the vials into the hand of the angels." By their preaching, their
prayers and their example, faithful ministers, unseduced by the blandishments of corrupt power,
and undismayed by the bloody edicts of the beast,--"in nothing terrified by their adversaries,"
denounce the judgments represented by these vials, upon the impenitent enemies of the Lord
and his Anointed. For an illustration of this symbolic action of giving the vials of divine
wrath to the appointed agents, reference may be had to Jer. xxv. 15-26; li. 7.

8.

Vs. 8.--"The temple filled with smoke," represents the darkness of these dispensations, the
horror and dismay which seizes upon the votaries of Antichrist. But during the time of executing
these judgments, the progress of the gospel will be retarded,--"no man being able to enter
into the temple." It is intimated, moreover, that these judgments will, as it were, clear away
the "smoke," and render the temple once more luminous. So we may conclude by comparing the
4th and 8th verses. In the 4th verse the witnesses declare their faith thus,--"All nations
shall come and worship before thee." But this is a description of the millennial state of the
world. (Ps. lxxii. 11.)

CHAPTER XVI.

All preliminaries being now arranged, the seven angels receive their commission by a "great
voice out of the temple." It is the "voice of the Lord, full of majesty." (Ps. xxix. 4.)--As
the seals and trumpets were not coincident, but successive, so it is doubtless with the vials.
No two begin to be poured out at the same time. One follows another in orderly succession.

Several questions of difficult solution, arise in the minds of devout and humble students of
the Apocalypse, respecting the series of the vials. Are the vials cotemporary with the trumpets?
Seeing that the seventh seal included all the trumpets, does analogy require that all the vials
be comprehended under the seventh or last trumpet? Or, do the seven vials come under the last
three trumpets, distinguished as they are by the character of woe-trumpets? (ch. viii. 13.)
Other questions may here be propounded; but these seem to be the most obvious and important,
in fixing the time of the events predicted.

The breaking of the seventh seal unquestionably laid open the whole of the book, including
all the trumpets and vials,--all future events till the end of the world; but it does not follow,
for instance, that the awful scene of the final judgment is to be cotemporary with any of the
trumpets, (ch. xx. 11, 12.) The seventh seal, therefore, discloses important events, which
are to come to pass subsequently to both trumpets and vials. The fact that both trumpets and
vials are disclosed by the opening of the last seal, admits of their being cotemporaneous.

From the striking resemblance between the effects of the trumpets and those of the vials, (ch.
viii. 7-12; xvi. 2-12,) they might seem to be cotemporary. This, however, is not the case,
for the objects of the judgments are different, that of the trumpets being more formally the
civil empire, while that of the vials is the ecclesiastical empire; each, however, greatly
affecting the other, because of their unholy union against the cause of Christ. Perhaps it
may be most consonant to the mind of the Spirit to view the vials as agreeing in time with
the three woe-trumpets. Keeping in view the definite period of Antichrist's domination in church
and state, 1260 years, and the probability of its drawing to a close, the remaining part would
seem too short for the period of the vials. As the series of the vials, like those which in
vision preceded them, is successive, the application of them all to the French Revolution is
simply preposterous.[12] That event answered not to the symbol either in extent or duration.
Nor indeed is there satisfactory evidence in the actual condition of the Christian world, notwithstanding
the fond imagination of learned and good men, that the voice of the seventh angel has yet been
heard by Christendom.

1.

V. 1.--"Earth" has here the usual meaning,--the whole territory and population of the Roman
empire, those only and always exempted, who are true to the cause of Immanuel. The angels of
destruction cannot hurt those who are under the protection of his blood. (Exod. xii. 23.) They
may not "come near any man upon whom is the mark." (Ezek. ix. 6; Rev. xiv.

Vs. 2-7.--"And the first went."--However disagreeable the service, as we are ready to suppose,
this holy agent at once obeys the divine command. The best of men hesitate and remonstrate
when called to difficult and disagreeable work. So it was with Moses, and with Jeremiah. (Exod.
iv. 10; Jer. i. 6.) But all these heavenly messengers in succession, execute their respective
tasks without gainsaying. It is the will of our common Lord that his disciples should emulate
their example, that they should "know, obey and submit to his will in all things as the angels
do in heaven." (Ps. ciii. 20, 21.)--The judgments upon the antichristian enemies which have
been briefly represented in the close of the 14th chapter by a harvest and vintage, are in
this chapter more extensively exhibited by the seven vials. A resemblance to the first four
trumpets may be observed in the effects of the first four vials, and besides, these plagues
resemble those inflicted on Egypt. If by her crimes, especially by idolatry and cruelty to
the people of God papal Rome has copied the manners of Egypt and Babylon, it is but just that
she should be visited with like punishment.--The first vial selects as victims those who "had
the mark of the beast and worshipped his image;" and this is true of the succeeding plagues,
although the fact be not repeated. The object of this vial is the "earth" in a more restricted
sense than in the first verse. The "earth" in the first verse comprises all the parts of a
system, "earth, sea, fountains, sun and air," mentioned in the following verses.--The "noisome
and grievous sore," refers to one of the plagues of Egypt. (Exod. ix. 9-11.) The earth was
the object affected also by the first trumpet; (ch. viii. 7;) but as Antichrist had not then
arisen, this plague cannot agree in time with the first trumpet, though it might with the fifth
or sixth trumpet; for while these trumpets were demolishing the eastern member of the Roman
empire, making way for the development of Mahomet's imposture, the "little horn" of Daniel,
and Paul's "man of sin," was revealed in the west. But the "two witnesses" were coincident
in origin with Antichrist, and were empowered by the Lord Christ "to smite the earth with all
plagues as often as they would," (ch. xi. 6.) The "grievous sore" is to be understood metaphorically,
not literally; for so the construction of the Apocalypse requires. It may import the festering
of unmortified corruption among the votaries of Antichrist, intensified by the faithful application
of the divine law by the witnesses.--The object of the second vial is the "sea," the same as
that of the second trumpet, (ch. viii. 8, 9.) The allusion is to Exod. vii. 20, 21. Intestine
commotions, with war, blood and death, seem to be symbolized. The horns of the beast were often
turned against one another; for the bestial kingdom was "partly broken." The toes in Nebuchadnezzar's
image did not "cleave one to another." (Dan. ii. 42, 43.)--The object of the third vial is
the "rivers and fountains of waters," (ch. viii. 10; Exodus vii. 19.) These symbols may signify
the several kingdoms of the empire, tributary by their wealth and traffic to the great city.
And as the witnesses continued to prophesy, giving increased point and publicity to their testimony,
and as the Turks were making encroachments upon the territories of nominal Christian princes
in the west, extensive wars and great slaughter were the results. These awful judgments are
followed by the plaudits of two angels. The eternal Jehovah is recognized as the Author of
these judgments. The Mediator may here be understood, (ch. i. 8;) (John v. 22, 27.) The "angel
of the waters" may be the same who poured out the vial. He gives to the Lord the glory of his
justice:--"Thou art righteous." He also approves the "law of retaliation:"--"For they are worthy."
The other angel "out of the altar" speaks on behalf of the martyrs, (ch. vi. 9, 10,) recognizing
the faithfulness of God:--"True and righteous are thy judgments."

Vs. 8,9.--The object of the fourth vial is the "sun," (ch. viii. 12.) "Power was given him,"--the
angel. The two witnesses are represented as armed with "fire, which proceedeth out of their
mouth, devouring their enemies," (ch. xi. 5.) As the formal object of all the vials is the
ecclesiastical, rather than the civil empire, and the sun is the symbol of the chief dignitary,
perhaps this vial strikes more directly upon the "man of sin." The expression in the introduction
to the vials, (ch. xv. 4,)--"thou only art holy," seems to be a testimony against the antichristian
"name of blasphemy,"--"His Holiness." By the Reformation, symbolized by successive angels of
the fourteenth chapter, those valiant men tormented the Pope and his vassals, so that they
raged and blasphemed more and more, but "repented not to give God the glory." So it was at
the sounding of the sixth trumpet, (ch. ix. 20, 21.)

10.

Vs. 10, 11.--"The seat of the beast" is the object of the fifth vial. The "beast" is all along
from chapter xi. 7, the Roman empire. The "image of the beast," we have found to be the papacy,
(ch. xiii. 14, 15.) Now the "seat (throne) of the beast," would seem to point to the metropolis,
where the Pope, as a kind of imperial, politico-ecclesiastical head, keeps his court, and whence
decrees are issued. This plague is like the ninth inflicted upon Egypt, (Exod. x. 21.) It was
the last but one, and left Pharaoh still impenitent. Just so here; although this vial is the
last but one to be poured out on the western limb of the great antichristian conspiracy: the
population of the spiritual empire repress their complaints before men,--"they gnawed their
tongues for pain;" while they in their hearts "curse their king and their God, and look upward."
(Is. viii. 21.) This may be understood to be the actual condition of the Pope and his retainers
at the present time, and especially since the year 1848, when he was forced to flee from Rome.
Darkness is the emblem of distress, of mental despair, (Ps. xxxv. 8; Is. viii. 22;) and the
actual relation of European powers to the see of Rome,--Austria, France, Spain, and the Italian
states, is not calculated to mitigate, but rather to augment and irritate the "pains and the
sores" inflicted by this and former vials.

We can, however, offer only conjectures here, and dare not be too confident; for learned and
pious expositors are of the opinion that all the vials are comprehended under the seventh trumpet;
that the seventh trumpet has not yet begun to sound; and consequently, that the vials are all
future. On the other hand, equally learned and godly interpreters of these Apocalyptic hieroglyphics,
are very confident that the sixth vial is in process of pouring out in our present time; and
that in fact its effects are obviously traceable in providence. Already we have indicated our
humble opinion, that all the vials are not necessarily comprehended under the seventh trumpet;
inasmuch as the opening of the last seal disclosed equally trumpets and vials: yet doubtless
it is requisite that the series of the trumpets should precede that of the vials, while nothing
hinders that of both series should cotemporate. We may conceive that as the first four trumpets
demolished the western member of the Roman empire, and the next two the eastern limb, so the
vials may be distributed in a manner somewhat similar. The second woe, or sixth trumpet, has
not yet finished its appropriate work in the final subversion of the Turkish empire, which
still exists; and during the time of its last echoes, the vials may be supposed to be accomplishing
their appropriate work upon the western empire, as being "wholly given to idolatry." While
the first five vials are consuming the Antichrist in the west, the sixth is operating in the east.

Vs. 12-16.--"The great river Euphrates" is the object of the sixth vial. By the very general
consent of expositors the Turkish empire is intended by this symbol; and they seem to be equally
agreed that the sixth vial in now in process of pouring out. The object of the sixth trumpet
is the same, (ch. ix. 14.) There is, besides, an obvious allusion to the ancient literal Babylon;
and to the manner of its overthrow by Cyrus the king of Persia. (Jer. l. 38; li. 36; Dan. v.
26-28; Is. xliv. 27, 28.)--This monarch, as historians relate, changed the current of the Euphrates,
and by this means took possession of the city, while Belshazzar and his nobles were engaged
in a drunken festival. (Dan. v. 1-30.)--The waters of this river are to be taken as representing
the population of the Ottoman empire, (ch. xvii. 15.) By the "kings of the east" may be understood
the Jews, agreeably to the symbolical nature of this book; (Is. xli. 2, 3;) yet as the Turkish
empire and Mahometan imposture constitute barriers to the extension of Christ's kingdom among
the populous nations of the east, as Popish despotism and idolatry, obstruct the gospel in
the west, we may give this symbol of the "kings of the east" a more extensive interpretation.
Probably a larger proportion of the natural seed of Abraham are to be found on the west than
even on the east of the Turkish empire. The dynasty of the Turk is in process of visible exhaustion,
and nothing but what is termed among antichristian nations "the balance of power," prolongs
its existence or hinders its extinction. "Drying up," evaporation, is a gradual process, and
with singular precision describes the waning light of the once proud Crescent,--the expiring
breath of what has been termed by a bold figure, "the sick man."[13]--Under this vial, however,
and likewise as the termination of the second woe, a general, final and desperate alliance
is to be found to resist the aggressive forces of the "Lord of Hosts."--This confederacy is
headed by the dragon, and is identical with the war, (ch. xii. 17,) against the "remnant of
the woman's seed."--These "unclean spirits like frogs" are called "spirits of devils." They
"come out of the mouth" of all the agents, the dragon, (ch. xii. 3, 9,) the beast, (ch. xiii.
1,) and the false prophet,--the same as the two-horned beast, (v. 11,) and (ch. xix. 20.) These
"unclean spirits" succeed in gathering the kings of the earth, by "working miracles," "lying
wonders." (2 Thess. ii. 9; 1 Tim. iv. 1, 2.) They are the agents of antichristian Rome, spiritual
wickedness in high places," (Eph. vi. 12;)--"like frogs," living in moral filth; garrulous
and impudent, stealthily gaining access into the bedchambers of the kings, "after the manner
of Egypt." (Exod. viii. 3.)--Surely the policy of Rome is here portrayed, her cardinals, archbishops,
Jesuits, etc., gaining entrance into the councils and cabinets of princes, inciting them to
debauchery, tyranny and blood. Hellish hosts are thus "gathered to the battle of that great
day of God Almighty,"--the day of the seventh vial, of the "vintage," (ch. xiv. 18-20,) and
of the seventh trumpet, (ch. xi. 15;) for all these agree in point of time.--This will be an
"hour of temptation," as intimated in the 15th verse, which is a parenthesis, interrupting
a little the narrative of the effects of the vial. There is danger of apostacy, of "falling
away to these Chaldeans," of temporizing with the enemy in order to escape suffering. Thus
Christian soldiers of the cross, losing "the armour of righteousness," would be exposed to
"shame." But "blessed is he that watcheth," that looks to the Captain of Salvation, to his
cause, as elucidated by his providence,--the signs of the times; for so shall he "keep his
garments," when others are "found naked."--"And he gathered them" or rather "they gathered,"
(for the singular verb agrees with its nominative plural neuter as usual,)--the "unclean spirits
gathered the kings of the earth" to the destined place. This hinders not but that these antichristian
enemies of the church are brought together by the Almighty. Just so he sent the king of Assyria
against "a hypocritical nation." (Is. x. 5-7.) And doubtless the prophet Joel prophesied of
this great and decisive battle, (ch. iii. 11-14.) "Thither cause thy mighty ones to come down,
O Lord." Compare vs. 1, 2. The place is called "Armageddon," the mountain of destruction, suggesting
the issue of the battle in the final overthrow of Antichrist; for it is not necessary to suppose
that any place is literally pointed out; but as this is a compound word in the "Hebrew tongue,"
allusion may be made to the slaughter of Sisera's army, (Judges v. 19;) or to the mournful
death of Josiah, (2 Chron. xxxv.

Vs. 17-21.--"The seventh angel poured out his vial into the air."--The devil is emphatically
styled "the prince of the power of the air." (Eph. ii. 2.) All the preceding vials fell upon
their respective and successive objects, the several parts of the symbolic system; but this
"vial of consummation" affects the whole of that system at once. The dragon, the beast, and
his image, together with the false prophet,--all the "kingdoms of this world and the glory
of them," which the god of this world claimed as his own, and offered to our Lord Jesus Christ
in the days of his humiliation, (Luke iv. 6, 7;)--all will be destroyed for ever. He who gave
commission by a "great voice," (v. 1,) to these angels, now that they have fulfilled his pleasure,
solemnly declares his approbation,--"It is done." Hence, it is undeniably evident that the
seventh trumpet agrees in time with the seventh vial; and it is equally evident that the events
which they represent are yet future. What was obscurely intimated as following the sounding
of the seventh trumpet,--"the nations were angry,--and thy wrath is come," (ch. xi. 18,) is
here amplified; for the "voices, thunders and lightnings," are the visible and sensible tokens
of the wrath of God. (Exod. xix. 16; Heb. xii. 21.) Next follows an "earthquake," the usual
symbol of revolution; but this one is without parallel. An earthquake followed the opening
of the sixth seal, (ch. vi. 12;) when paganism was overthrown in the Roman empire by Constantine,
and another earthquake marked the close of the second woe, (ch. xi. 13,) when "the tenth part
of the city fell:" but this concussion is "so mighty and so great" as to "divide the great
city into three parts," or rival factions: next, "the cities of the nations fell,"--revolted
from their wonted allegiance, and "great Babylon came in remembrance before God," who seemed
to have forgotten both her and his saints whom she had so long and so cruelly persecuted. At
the fall of Rome pagan, mountains and islands were only "moved out of their places," (ch. vi.
14;) but at the fall of Rome papal, "every island fled away, and the mountains were not found;"--the
former indicating transition, the latter utter destruction.--The "fall of hail" is to be viewed
as accompanying, not following, the fall of cities, flight of islands and mountains. As hail-stones
are symbolical of divine judgments, and as there may be allusion here to another of the plagues
of Egypt, (Exod. ix. 18;) so more especially may the facts of history supply the figurative
language with which the judgments of the vials terminate. If any escaped the destroying sword
in the battle of Armageddon, they are overtaken by these ponderous hail-stones out of heaven;
even as "the Lord cast down great stones from heaven" upon the five kings of the Amorites;
so that "more died with hailstones than they whom the children of Israel slew with the sword."
(Jos. x. 11.)--The result is as before; the survivors remain impenitent. As history supplies
no instance of literal hail-stones of a talent weight, (sixty pounds, or as others, a hundred,)
so the symbol represents this as the most tremendous of all the judgments of God, (ch. xiv. 20.)

Thus, we have seen that the last trumpet and the last vial combine, in the final perdition
of Babylon the great.

CHAPTER XVII.

This chapter may be considered introductory to the eighteenth, or as a digression in the narrative,
to explain more fully the integral parts of that complex, mystical moral person so often called
"great Babylon," whose destruction was so awfully presented in the foregoing chapter.

1.

Vs. 1, 2.--The angel that "talked with the apostle" was probably the seventh. "The great whore"
is the symbol of the idolatrous church of Rome, which broke her marriage covenant with Christ.
Idolatry is spiritual whoredom. (Hosea vi. 10.) Her "sitting upon many waters" is explained,
verse 15. "The kings of the earth" are her paramours, and their subjects are partakers in the
crime,--"made drunk."

3.

Vs. 3-5.--The "scarlet-coloured beast" is the Roman empire professing the Christian religion,
modelled by the Romish church; for the "woman sits upon the beast," guiding and controlling
all its motions. (James iii. 3.) The raiment of both is at once imperial and bloody,--"purple
and scarlet."--The raiment of this "woman" is decked with precious metal, stones and pearls,
after the usual "attire of a harlot." (Ezek. xvi. 17.) The "cup" alludes to the practice of
harlots giving love-potions to their paramours, very expressive of the indulgences, absolutions,
preferments, etc., by which the church of Rome attracts disciples to her idolatry. "The nations
have drunken of her wine; therefore the nations are mad." (Jer. li. 7.)--The inscription "upon
her forehead" is after the manner of shameless prostitutes, avowing Rome's whoredoms of idolatry,
monasticism, indulgences to sin, as essential to religion, a "mystery of iniquity," by which
the "man of sin thinks to change times and laws." (Dan. vii. 24, 25; xi. 36, 37.)

6.

V. 6.--This "woman,"--Christian church,--was "drunken with the blood of saints and martyrs."
Of course, such a sight would give rise to the apostle's astonishment.

Vs. 7-11.--The angel explains the "mystery of the woman and of the beast that carrieth her."
The beast, the civil power, carrieth, sustains the woman, the church; as the church controls
the state, (v. 3; ch. xiii. 1, 11, 16.) The "beast that was, and is not, and yet is," is a
mysterious personage as well as the woman; therefore all who "dwell upon the earth,"--not in
"heaven, wonder," (ch. xiii. 3-6;)--that is, all the vassals of Antichrist, distinguished from
those whose "names are in the book of life,"--the two witnesses.--"The seven heads" of the
beast signify seven mountains, on which Rome literally stands, namely, Capitoline, Palatine,
Aventine, Esquiline, Coelian, Viminal and Quirinal. Here the woman and Rome are manifestly
identical,--the spiritual empire. But the heads of the beast have a double meaning; for they
also signify "seven kings" or successive forms of civil government. At the time when John wrote,
"five had fallen;" they had passed into actual history. One was then existing, namely, the
emperor, in the person of Domitian, as is supposed. This is the imperial head, whose "deadly
wound was healed," (ch. xiii. 3.)--The "seventh head was not come" in the apostles' time, but
on his appearance, he was to "continue a short space." The papacy is not the seventh head.
He is a horn. (Dan. vii. 8, 20.) But a horn of the beast cannot identify with the beast himself.
It is otherwise with a head, which is the form of government over the whole empire. The patriciate
succeeded the imperial, being the seventh head, and only of short duration, about fifty years.
Charlemagne was crowned emperor of the Romans in the year eight hundred; and so the patriciate
terminated. This is the eighth, which "is of the seven;" and goeth into perdition. This septimo-octave
head is so variable, sometimes acknowledged as residing in Austria, then in France, etc., that
for hundreds of years, the great republic of the nations,--all bestial,--are at a loss to identify
the visible head in whom resides the precedency: hence the "balance of power" is so perplexing
and difficult to adjust. Were there an acknowledged imperial and despotic head, this obvious
difficulty could not exist. But the beast is not. Nevertheless the arbitrary power of the horns
of the beast is sensibly felt in every part of the Roman empire.--The beast is, and will continue
till "the time of the end;" (Dan. xii. 9;) for the Roman empire must be equal in duration with
the life and actings of the two witnesses, 1260 years.

Vs. 12-14.--"The ten horns" signify "ten kings" or regal or civil sovereignties, into which
the empire was to be partitioned after John's time, and which we have seen was effected by
the first four trumpets, (ch. viii. 7-12.)--These "received power one hour with the beast,"--rather,
at one time, or cotemporaneously with the beast; for they are his horns, and are of "one mind,
giving their power and strength," all their resources, to him. These shall make war with the
Lamb," the Mediator, headed by the dragon, and instigated by the beast and his image, (ch.
xii. 7; xiii.

V. 15.--"The waters," controlled by "the whore," are the multitudes whom the apostate church
of Rome commands to volunteer in the wars of the kings against the Lamb.

V. 16.--What a surprising change! yet how natural! (2 Sam. xiii. 15.) The punishment is that
which was adjudged in the case of a priest's daughter. (Lev. xxi. 9.)--The "ten horns," here,
are to be understood generally, not universally, (ch. xviii. 9; xix.

V. 17.--Here we are led into the secret cause of the wonderful change in the policy of the
horns: "God hath put into their hearts." They just do to the "great whore, whatsoever God's
hand and counsel determined before to be done." (Acts iv. 28. See also Exod. vii. 3; Gen. xiv.

V. 18.--This "woman is the great city;" not literally the city of Rome; but the imperial ecclesiastical
jurisdiction, to whose authority intoxicated kings and their subjects bowed in slavish submission;
and whose bloody decrees they had executed for 1260 years upon many of their best subjects
and fellow-creatures.

CHAPTER XVIII.

1.

Vs. 1-3.--After the apostle had described Babylon in the preceding chapter, he "saw another
angel." This seems to be the Lord Christ, the same as in ch. x. 1. He "confirmeth the word
of his servants," (ch. xiv. 8;) that "Babylon the great has fallen," and is adequately punished
for her crimes, which are enumerated, v. 3.

V. 4.--The phrase, "my people" indicates that the speaker is not a created angel whose warning
is here given with a "voice from heaven." This call of the Lord Jesus has been addressed to
his elect, ever since the revelation of the "man of sin." It has been obeyed but partially
hitherto: but upon the sounding of the seventh trumpet, his Holy Spirit will give the call
unusual efficacy. Therefore shall her plagues come in one day, death, and mourning, and famine;
and she shall be utterly burnt with fire; for strong is the Lord God who judgeth her.

Vs. 5-8.--"Her sins have reached unto heaven," and now she is to be visited with condign punishment;
although it seemed both to her and God's own people long delayed. "God hath remembered her
iniquities." There is reference to ancient Babylon's punishment, and the law of retaliation.
(Jer. l. 15; Ps. cxxxvii. 8; Is. xlvii. 1-8.) Her punishment is destruction from the Almighty":
"strong is the Lord God who judgeth her."

Vs. 9-19.--At the fall of Babylon some of the kings who had been her supporters, will lament
for her while utterly unable to protect her, and afraid of partaking of her plagues. It may
be proper to remark, that the word translated "alas," and repeated in this chapter, is the
same in the Greek text as that which is rendered, "woe" in ch. viii. 13; from which fact we
are to infer that the fall of mystical Babylon described in this chapter comes under the last
three, or probably the seventh trumpet. That the Turkish empire is to be overthrown by the
sixth trumpet or second woe, and gradually exhausted by the sixth vial, hardly admits of a
doubt: but it does not necessarily follow, that said trumpet and vial are to terminate when
that judgment ends. Each trumpet and vial may continue its effects for some time after the
following one commences.--Kings, merchants and shipmasters are mentioned as chief mourners,
while they are helpless spectators of this judgment. In all this narrative there is plain allusion
to the language of Old Testament prophets who predicted the destruction of the enemies of God's
people; as Babylon, Tyre, Egypt. All these powerful kingdoms have been made desolate for their
idolatry and cruelty; and thus history comes in aid of prophecy to confirm the faith of the
saints. The moral government of the Most High is uniform, and he will execute vengeance upon
his and Zion's impenitent enemies. The merchandise and lamentations are borrowed from Ezek.
xxvii. In ver. 13 there is mention made of "the persons of men" as part of the wares in the
markets of Tyre, and we find "slaves (bodies) and souls of men," among the commodities for
sale in modern Babylon. How can we, in view of historic facts, exempt the United States of
North America from complicity in the crimes of mystic Babylon as one of her dependencies? While
earthly politicians, sustained by eminent divines, proclaimed to the world in gushing oratory
that "America was an asylum for the oppressed of all nations,"--"the land of the free, and
the home of the brave;" perhaps there never was a more effectual refutation of this popular
sentiment, accompanied with a more biting sarcasm, than that which was uttered in derisive
song by the sable, coffled chain-gang in the streets of the national capital,--"Hail! Columbia,
happy land!"--All who are acquainted with the internal and political history of the United
States, know that the adherents of the "Man of Sin" always gave their suffrages for the support
and continuance of that cursed traffic.

The great variety of the articles of merchandise here enumerated, is calculated to impress
the reader with the idea of the wealth, luxury, splendor, and self-indulgence of the metropolis
of the idolatrous Roman empire, the "mother and mistress of all churches."--The prophetic declaration,
however,--"with feigned words shall they make merchandise of you," (2 Pet. ii. 3,) is not confined
to the Romish communion. This traffic, in souls, pervades all the streets of symbolic Babylon.--The
overthrow is sudden and unexpected,--"in one hour." This is thrice repeated, (vs. 10, 17, 19.)
In v. 18 this "spiritual Sodom" is compared to her prototype in her fearful end. "They saw
the smoke of her burning." (Gen. xix.

V. 20.--Judgments on the impenitent enemies of God and of the saints, are mercies to the church.
(Ps. cxxxvi. 15-20;) and consequently, while the former are lamenting for the fall of the great
city, the latter are exhorted to rejoice in her ruin,--all the members of the church in general,
and "holy apostles and prophets" in particular. The apostles are daily worshipped at Rome in
their supposed likenesses, the work of the "cunning artificer; but here they are mentioned
as rejoicing in the destruction of the idolatrous sinners who so greatly dishonoured them,
and detracted from the glory of God.--As "there is joy in heaven over one sinner that repenteth,"
so is there over the destruction of the impenitent. (Jer. li. 48.) "So let all thine enemies
perish, O Lord." And the light of a candle shall shine no more at all in thee; and the voice
of the bridegroom and of the bride shall be heard no more at all in thee: for thy merchants
were the great men of the earth; for by thy sorceries were all nations deceived.

Vs. 21-23.--The emblem of "a great millstone cast into the sea," is a very striking indication
of the sudden and irretrievable ruin of mystic Babylon, and contains an allusion to Jer. li.
63, 64.--The removal of "musicians, craftsmen, candles, etc.," from this devoted city, as they
plainly point to the statuary, music and paintings which have attracted multitudes to the idolatry,
superstition and harlotry of antichristian Rome, emphatically proclaims the utter and perpetual
desolation of papal Rome. The language is borrowed from Isa. xxiv. 8; Jer. xxv. 10; Ezek. xxvi.
13.--Her merchants being the "great men of the earth," and the "sorceries" by "which the nations
were deceived, very plainly indicate the successful traffic of the "mother of harlots,"--the
church of Rome.

24.

V. 24.--When the Lord "maketh inquisition for blood," the "blood of all that were slain upon
the earth,"--for Christ's sake, will be found in the skirts of this Jezebel. Papal Rome has
shed more innocent blood than pagan Rome; than Babylon, Tyre and Egypt; and by her relentless
cruelty to "prophets and saints," ministers and members of the witnessing church, she has endorsed
all the murderous persecutions from Abel down to the present day. (Luke xi. 50, 51; Acts vii.
52.)--Now when we contemplate in the light of prophecy, confirmed by authentic history, the
numberless, aggravated and long-continued crimes of Babylon the great, her pride, (v. 7,) her
cruelty, (v. 3,) her luxury, her tyranny, her idolatry, her fornication, her impenitence in
all,--can we hesitate to acquiesce in the righteousness of her final doom, or to join in the
plaudits of the saints in the next chapter?

CHAPTER XIX.

1.

Vs. 1-4.--The frequent repetition of the Hebrew word "Alleluia" in this chapter, may perhaps
be an intimation of something which specially relates to the Jews. The perpetuity of the covenant
made with Abraham, renewed to Isaac, and confirmed to Jacob, (Ps. cv. 9, 10,) is clearly taught
in the Scriptures. (Gen. xvii. 7; Acts ii. 39; Rom. iv. 13; Gal. iii. 14, 29.)

It has been already intimated, (ch. xi. 15,) that at the sounding of the seventh trumpet, "there
were great voices in heaven, saying, The kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of
our Lord and of his Christ; and he (Christ,) shall reign for ever and ever." Beholding the
overthrow of Babylon, all the people of God were invited, (ch. xviii. 20,) to "rejoice over
her," for her downfall was effected under the last trumpet and vial. With that invitation the
saints here joyfully comply. "Much people in heaven," implies a great augmentation of their
number, and as "heaven" signifies the church on earth, we are warranted to expect a rapid increase
of her membership as the consequence of the sounding of the seventh trumpet.--At the pouring
out of the third vial, (ch. xvi. 7,) the angel of the altar said, "True and righteous are thy
judgments." The very same sentiment is repeated here by the "much people,"--all the saints.
Thus they recognise the faithfulness and justice of God, as he heard and answered the cry of
the "souls under the altar;" (ch. vi. 9, 10,) for he had now "avenged their blood" and that
of their "brethren that had been killed as they were," upon them that dwell on the earth,--the
population of mystic Babylon. (Ps. cxxxvii. 8, 9.) "And again they said, Alleluia; and her
smoke rose up for ever and ever," like that of Sodom. In all this, the ministry and members
of the whole church cordially join, adding their hearty and solemn "Amen!"

For this protracted joy and exulting praise, two causes seem to be in operation, God's judgment
on Babylon, and his mercy on Zion. Both are matter of praise. (Ps. ci. 1.)

5.

7.

Vs. 5-9.--This happy company are called upon to renew their song. The call seems to come from
some one who is authorized to speak with authority, "out of the throne." All the servants of
God are invited, and all appear to respond, "a great multitude." This is the most animated
of all the examples of praise recorded in this book. It is compared to the rushing of waters
down a cataract, as the roaring of the sea, or the rolling of thunder in the heavens. It is
indeed the "voice of them that shout for mastery,"--and "all the people shout with a great
shout, for the Lord hath given them the city,"--"Alleluia, praise ye the Lord, for the Lord
God omnipotent reigneth." This is the day of our New Testament Solomon's espousals, and the
day of the gladness of his heart. (Song iii. 11.)--Not only the Jews, but the great majority
of professing Christians during the 1260 years of Antichrist's usurpations, have refused to
"submit themselves to the righteousness of God." (Rom. x. 3.) The kings of the earth also have
fostered the pride and profligacy of the great whore, instead of the bride of the Lamb. The
lewd woman, and the woman in the wilderness hitherto, are now to be distinguished. As their
character and conduct are different, so is their raiment. The gaudy and splendid attire of
the former, is in striking contrast with that of the latter; which is that of a "woman professing
godliness," (ch. xvii. 4; 1 Tim. ii. 10.)--"To her was granted,"--Precious words; for the "Lamb's
wife of herself was utterly destitute," (ch. iii. 17.) The Jews, in the day of their Messiah's
power, (Psa. cx. 3,) convinced of the law as transgressors, will be brought to adopt the language
of their own prophet, (Is. lxi. The righteousness of Christ imputed for justification, and
the Spirit of Christ imparted for sanctification, together with good works, the visible evidence
of both, will constitute the "fine linen, clean and white, which is the righteousness of saints."
This is, after all, a more costly, as well as more comely attire, than that of the mother of
harlots. (Ps. xlv. 13, 14.)--"And he saith."--That is, say some, the angel, (ch. xvii. 1, 7;
or ch. xviii. 1;) but we are rather to view him as the same who brings all these messages from
Christ to the apostle, (ch. i. 1.) The angel pronounces those "blessed who are called to the
marriage supper of the Lamb."--In the beginning of the New Testament dispensation, the invitation
was to a dinner. (Matt. xxii. 4.) The day will have been far spent at the sounding of the seventh
trumpet, when Jews and Gentiles are called to this supper. It will be the last great feast
of the church militant. But who shall live to partake of the banquet? The angel gives his solemn
attestation to "these sayings."

10. And I fell at his feet to worship him.

V. 10.--This is a surprising incident,--an aged, experienced and holy man, an apostle, "falling
down to worship the angel!" And we are told that he relapsed into the same sin, (ch. xxii.
8, 9.) Like Peter on the mount, who "wist not what to say;" or Paul in the "third heaven ...
whether in the body or out of the body, he could not tell." (Mark ix. 6; 2 Cor. xii. 3.) John
had become overpowered by the visions and transported by the high praises which he saw and
heard. The like effects were experienced by Daniel, (viii. 18; x. 8, 17.)--This sin of idolatry
by the apostle was doubtless permitted by the Lord, in order to furnish occasion for a testimony
from the angel, against the "voluntary humility and worshipping of angels," (Col. ii. 18;)
practised by the Papists, and to leave them without excuse.--The abrupt language of the angel
in this and a subsequent case, is strongly expressive of resentment:--"See--not." Such is the
curt, sententious utterance in the Greek text. He assigns the best reason and strongest argument
against idolatry:--"I am thy fellow-servant," a creature as well as yourself: we are servants
of one Lord, who alone is the object of our devotion, "Worship God." This is the best counsel,
enforced by the most cogent reasoning,--"For the testimony of Jesus is the Spirit of prophecy."
This sentence may be read,--"The Spirit of prophecy is the testimony of Jesus;" and it will
be equally true. "To him give all the prophets witness," (Acts x. 43;) for "the Spirit of Christ
was in them;" (1 Pet. i. 11;) and this fact is well known to holy angels. (Eph. iii. 10; 1
Pet. i. 12.) So this angel plainly declares.

16.

Vs. 11-16.--"Heaven opened" once more, allows the apostle to look upon Messiah the Prince going
forth to fresh conquests. As he began, (ch. vi. 2,) so he continues, "in righteousness to judge
and make war;" not as the ambitious tyrants who "destroy the earth," (ch. xi. 18.) He has here
three names,--"Faithful and True, The Word of God, king of kings and Lord of lords; yet he
has a "name written which no man knoweth but he himself."--His infinite essence and eternal
generation are incomprehensible by angels and men.--He is, however, known by his mediatorial
titles,--"faithful and true" to all covenant engagements; as the prophet of the church, he
"declares the Father," making known the "word of God;" and his lordship is at once a warning
to his enemies and security to his friends.--"On his head were many crowns," emblematical of
his numerous victories over the princes of the earth, especially the "ten kings," (ch. xvii.
14.)--"His eyes as a flame of fire," going though the whole earth "in every place," (Prov.
xv. 3;) render it impossible for his enemies to elude discovery. (Jer. xxiii. 24.)--His "vesture
dipped in blood," refers to his victories over all his malicious and impenitent foes. (Is.
lxiii. 1-3; Rev. xiv. 20.)--His "armies on white horses, clothed in fine linen, white and clean,"
are uniformed like their leader, (ch. xii. 7;) for "they that are with him are called, and
chosen, and faithful," (ch. xvii. 14.)--The weapon with which he "smites the nations" that
oppose him, is the "sharp sword," an emblem of his ruinous and avenging justice; for he "tradeth
the wine-press of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God."--"On his thigh," where he wears
his sword, there is a legible inscription, indicating his universal and rightful authority.

Vs. 17-21.--The position of the "angel standing in the sun," and "crying with a loud voice;"
represents, that Messiah's judgments would be visible to all the world; and the extent of the
invitation to the "fowls," indicates the vast slaughter of his enemies. Babylon being "utterly
burned with fire," (ch. xvii. 16, xviii. 8,) as a suitable punishment of an apostate church;
the "flesh of kings, of captains, of mighty men," etc., as a sacrifice to divine justice, is
given as a feast to the fowls of heaven. The allusion here is to the destruction of "Gog and
Magog." (Ezek. xxxix. 17-20.) These enemies of the saints are to appear and be overthrown before
the millennium; and although John borrows the names of these enemies, (ch. xx. 8,) they are
not the same as those of Ezekiel; the one appearing before, the other after the thousand years.
We have often found the enemies of the church called in the Apocalypse by the names of persecutors
under the Old Testament;--Babylon, Egypt, etc.--We may consider the "fowls," the birds of prey,
as symbolizing the kings who retaliate upon Babylon; (as in ch. xvii. 16;) or rather, as the
Lord's people reclaiming their own, of which they had been unjustly and long deprived,--"spoiling
the Egyptians." (Exod. xii. 36.)

Some suppose that the confederacy of the "kings of the earth" with the beast, (v. 19,) is a
distinct attack from that mentioned in chapter seventeenth; (v. 14;) but perhaps it is safer
to consider it as the same, only more distinctly and fully exhibited here. Indeed it seems,
from the agency of the "false prophet," to be the same event as that under the sixth vial,
(ch. xvi. 14;) preparing to the battle of Armageddon. The Lord Jesus as "captain of the Lord's
hosts," and the army of heaven following him, all of them on white horses, appear to be on
the one side; and the beast with the kings of the earth, instigated by the false prophet, on
the other. The rank and file like their leaders are described as having "received the mark
of the beast and worshiped his image." But the beast of the earth, (ch. iii. 11,) causes all
ranks to receive the mark, and worship the image of the beast, (vs. 15, 16) The beast of the
earth, the woman, and the false prophet, all mean the same thing; and that is, an apostate
church in alliance with tyrannical civil powers, (ch. xvii. 3.) Now, if the great city Babylon,
a symbol which comprises the whole antichristian confederacy, has been utterly destroyed, as
appears in the eighteenth chapter, whence come these enemies bearing the same characters? The
only solution of this apparent difficulty is by supposing as we have done, that this is a re-exhibition
of what has been more obscurely symbolized, (ch. xiv. 20; xvi. 17; xvii. 16; xviii. 2, 8, 20,)
in order more distinctly to point out the end of two principal leaders,--the "beast and the
false prophet," the empire and church of Rome. "These both were cast alive into a lake of fire
burning with brimstone."--"The remnant were slain." When the leaders were discomfited, the
ranks were soon broken, and the whole army melted away. They were slain with Messiah's sword,
the emblem of his justice, (ch. i. 16.)

Thus "Babylon is fallen, to rise no more at all:" all the visible enemies of the Lord and his
Anointed are cut off from the face of the earth: and it remains only that he who originated
the rebellious conspiracy be put under necessary restraint.

CHAPTER XX.

1.

Vs. 1-3.--"And I saw an angel." This angel is the Lord Christ, (ch. x. 1.) The key is the symbol
of authority. (Is. xxii. 22; chs. i. 18; iii. 7.) The dragon had been previously cast down
from heaven, (ch. xii. 9;) by the Reformation, and during the "short time" of his liberty,
he persecuted the woman and the remnant of her seed, on the earth. Now, however, his career
is arrested. "Seizing, binding, casting into the abyss, shutting up, and setting a seal upon
that old serpent," (ch. xii. 9,) are strong figurative expressions, by which his secure confinement
is signified. Thus is the devil to be restrained from deceiving the nations for a "thousand
years." That this period is to be taken in a proper, and not in a mystical sense, appears thus.
If we multiply one thousand by three hundred and sixty, as some fancifully do, the resulting
number of years, three hundred and sixty thousand, would be out of all proportion to the past
duration of the world, as well as the well-defined period of 1260 years. Add to this, that
when by Daniel and John definite duration is symbolically mentioned, it is by "months, days;
time, times and a half a time," or "the dividing of time,"--never by "years."

At the expiration of the thousand years, Satan will be loosed a "little season,"--little, as
compared with the thousand years; so little, as not to be deemed worth estimating.

4. And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given unto them: and I saw the
souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus, and for the word of God, and which
had not worshipped the beast, neither his image, neither had received his mark upon their foreheads,
or in their hands: and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years.

V. 4.--"And I saw thrones." Here there is no mention of heaven being opened. Nothing henceforth
obstructs John's vision. "The darkness is past, and the true light now shineth."--"At evening
time it shall be light." (Zech. xiv. 7.)--"And they sat on them." Who?--There is here what
may be termed a remarkable chasm in the language of the text. There is no visible or proximate
antecedent. Who are they who "sit on thrones?" Did Millenarians only put this question, and
patiently search for the solution in the context, agreeably to the allegorical texture of this
whole book, all their hallucinations might be easily and happily obviated. The inspired writer
assumes, of course, that the reader will readily identify these persons, who are thus promoted
to honour, now that Antichrist is no more, and society is to be reorganized.--Daniel furnishes
a satisfactory answer to our question. "I beheld till the thrones were cast down." (Dan. vii.
9.) The Roman imperial thrones of civil despotism were subverted. Again,--"But the judgment
shall sit, and they shall take away his dominion, to consume and to destroy it unto the end."
(v. 26.) The Roman imperial throne of ecclesiastical domination shall be destroyed. (Is. xlix.
23; lx. 12.)--The souls which the apostle saw under the altar, whose cry for vengeance he heard,
and who were directed to rest for a little season, till the roll of their martyred brethren
should be completed, are here presented in quite a new position, "sitting on thrones," (ch.
vi. 9.) Although they are not the same identical persons physically, they are the same morally;
for the life of the two witnesses is commensurate with the reign of Antichrist,--twelve hundred
and sixty years. These "lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years; that is, in their successive
generations: for otherwise they would over-live the age of Methuselah!--Souls are here evidently
persons, and not souls as distinct from bodies, as some needlessly argue against Millenarians:
for "foreheads" and "hands" are attributed to them: but foreheads cannot be literally ascribed
to those who had been "beheaded." Their living is to be understood of their succeeding to the
same scriptural position occupied by their predecessors, as well as succeeding them in the
order of natural generation. The Holy Spirit says, "Levi, who receiveth tithes, paid tithes
in Abraham." (Heb. vii. 9, 10.) Elijah reappeared in the person of John the Baptist. (Matt.
xi. 14.) Jezebel and Balaam were recognised in their wicked successors, (ch. ii. 14, 20.) But
this is the very structure of the Apocalypse, being composed of hieroglyphics, that the free
agency of the wicked might be left untrammelled, and the diligence of God's people might be
tested in "searching the Scriptures."

5. But the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished. This is
the first resurrection.

V. 5.--"The rest of the dead" supposes two classes of the dead. These are the witnesses, who
died a violent and cruel death, and the wicked, who died a natural death,--there "were no bands
in their death." As there are two kinds of death, so are there two kinds of resurrection,--a
first and second of each. Those who had been "beheaded for the witness of Jesus," etc., lived
in their successors,--sat on thrones, reigned with Christ a thousand years. Of course those
who were slain by Christ and his army at the battle of Armageddon, and whose flesh was given
to the fowls of heaven, "lived not again" in their successors, "until the thousand years were
finished." Consequently, "this is the first resurrection," with which the true disciples of
Christ shall be honoured. They must, however, die as all others, and await the second resurrection:
but "on them the second death shall have no power."

6.

V. 6.--"Blessed and holy,"--and blessed, because holy; for sin is the procuring cause of misery.
This is a summary description of the millennial period. The dragon being bound by the almighty
power of Christ, and not permitted to deceive the nations, wars shall cease unto the ends of
all the earth: the population of the globe must be rapidly and greatly multiplied beyond all
precedent. (Ps. xlvi. 9; lxxii. 16,) the life of man will be prolonged; (Isa. lxv. 20-25,)
holiness, righteousness and praise shall spring forth before all the nations, (lxi. 11.)

That condition of our globe, which divines call the millennium,--a state of holiness and happiness,
second only to the enjoyment of heavenly felicity, is as clearly and frequently promised to
God's people, as the promise of the Messiah was under the former economy. But as many were
"in expectation that the kingdom of God should immediately appear," who then entertained unwarrantable
and carnal conceptions of the Messiah's person and reign, just such groundless and gross expectations
and aspirations are cherished now. A literal resurrection of all the righteous, who shall have
died before the millennium is supposed to take place at the personal appearance of Christ;
and this, too, before the general judgment. By personal, they mean corporeal: for the Lord
Christ promised his gracious personal presence with his people all days, when he was about
to disappear from their bodily vision. (Matt. xxviii. 20.) "To them that look for him shall
he appear the second time, (not a third,) without sin unto salvation." (Heb. ix. 28; Rev. i.
7.) Besides, is it for a moment supposable that saints who have passed into glory, are to be
brought upon earth to conflict once more with enemies, when Gog and Magog shall surround the
"camp of the saints?" Such is a specimen of questions suggested by the Millenarian system,
which have failed of either scriptural or rational solution by all the learning and ingenuity
of its fanciful advocates.

The whole series of the Apocalypse proves that the two witnesses live and prophesy throughout
the 1260 years of Antichrist's reign. Their lives and their testimony end together, (ch. xi.
7.) But the beast that slays them is himself with his ally, the false prophet, at the close
of the contest, cast alive into the lake of fire, (ch. xix. 20.)

After three and a half prophetical days, the witnesses are raised, and ascend up to heaven,
(ch. xi. 12;) and this is the identical fact which is more fully presented here in the 20th
chapter. The resurrection of the witnesses in the 11th chapter is a spiritual and mystical
resurrection in the persons of their successors; the heaven to which they were exalted is a
mystical heaven: and just so of those beheaded and advanced, after their resurrection, to positions
of civil and ecclesiastic power as in this 20th chapter. Thus exalted, and ruling in the fear
of God, they become a terror to evil doers, and a praise to them that do well. (Rom. xiii.
3.) Then shall be realized the glorious predictions of Isaiah and the Sweet Psalmist of Israel.
(Isa. xi. 1-9; Ps. lxxii.

Vs. 7-9.--"Satan shall be loosed out of his prison."--The Lord Christ will remove the restraint
which had repressed the chief enemy during the thousand years, that the Faithful and True Witness
may give a final testimony to the moral universe, that neither the philosophy of proud man,
nor the law of Moses,--no, nor the ordinances of the gospel, will ever change the nature of
a sinner:--That neither judgments nor mercies have any efficacy to subdue the stubborn will,
or renew the desperately wicked heart of man; and that it is a righteous thing with God to
render tribulation to them that trouble his saints and insult his Majesty.

Thus released "for a little season," the prime enemy goes out as before to "deceive the nations."
He is successful. "The rest of the dead," who lived not again during the 1000 years, at once
re-appear in the persons of their genuine successors. They are the children of them that killed
the witnesses;--the seed of the serpent aiming a last fatal stroke at the seed of the woman.--They
are called "Gog and Magog;" and because of the identity of names, many have supposed them to
be the same as those enemies of the people of God described by Ezekiel, (chs. xxxviii., xxxix.)
This view is, however, without sanction in the Scriptures. The characters are mystical according
to the uniform structure of the Apocalypse. Ezekiel's Gog and Magog come from the "north quarters;"
those of John from the "four quarters or corners of the earth." It is also probable, if not
absolutely certain, that the enemies predicted by Ezekiel are to appear before, while those
of John are to arise after the millennium. The overthrow of Gog and Magog, foretold by Ezekiel,
is evidently connected with the conversion of the Jews, (ch. xxxix. 22, 29;) but that event
must precede the millennial period. (Rom. xi. 26.)--Magog is reckoned with Meshech and Tubal
among the sons of Japheth, (Gen. x. 2;) and those nations called in history Scythians and Tartars,
in the "north quarters" of Europe and Asia, as well as the "isles of the Gentiles," are supposed
to be their descendants. By the "three unclean spirits," (ch. xvi. 13,) a confederacy was effected
under the sixth vial to the battle of Armageddon; and the same is again presented in ch. xix.
20, as the final attempt against the saints previously to the millennium, when two of the prime
instigators, the beast and the false prophet, are cast into the lake of fire. Thus we may suppose
eastern and western Antichrist finally destroyed.

Ezekiel's Gog and Magog being slain in the battle of Armageddon, how or where shall we find
those of John? They are to be found precisely on the same principle on which we find the witnesses
of Christ in this chapter. Satan is loosed "a little season,"--little as compared with the
thousand years of Messiah's reign; or rather, as compared with the 1260 years of the dragon's
successful enterprises against the saints through the beast and false prophet as agents. These
being now cast into the lake of fire, Satan is for ever deprived of their agency. During the
millennial period people will be born in sin as at other times; and at the close of that happy
period, Almighty God will display his sovereignty by withholding his grace, that a last demonstration
may be given to all the world of the necessity and efficacy of that grace in changing the heart
of a sinner. Without the intervention of the beast or the false prophet, Satan will prevail
by more direct temptations to gather together to battle a multitude of the same spirit as Ezekiel's
Gog and Magog displayed against the saints before the millennium. These are the "rest of the
dead that lived not again till the one thousand years were finished." As the "deadly wound"
of the civil beast "was healed," and he received a new life, to the astonishment of spectators,
(ch. xiii. 3,) as the witnesses received "the Spirit of life from God," to the dismay of their
enemies; (chs. xi. 11; xx. 4,) so Gog and Magog re-appear in the persons and bloody cruelties
of their genuine successors. And in language similar to that in the context we may warrantably
say,--this is the second resurrection; for when it is declared that the "rest of the dead lived
not again," it is manifest that two classes of dead are intended. All are said to be dead;
the witnesses, slain by the beast; their enemies, slain by the Lord. The witnesses rise, and
"this is the first resurrection." A first implies a second of the same kind. Well, "the rest
lived not again till the thousand years were finished." What then? Why, simply this,--that
the other remaining class of the dead lived again; and this appears to be the obvious scope
and meaning of these terms, so vexing to many critics.

By deception Satan prevails to assemble the nations in vast multitudes, "as the sand of the
sea,"--a proverbial form of expression applied to Abraham's seed. (Gen. xxii. 17.) "They went
up on the breadth of the earth." Coming from the "four quarters of the earth," they "compassed
the camp of the saints." The allusion here is twofold: to Israel in the wilderness, in the
time of Moses; and to the holy city Jerusalem, in the days of David; (Ps. cxviii. 10-12,) for
often did the enemy with "joint heart" attempt to "cut off the name of Israel." (Ps. lxxxiii.
4-8.) Never was Pharaoh or Sennacherib more confident of a sure and easy victory over the saints.
(Exod. xv. 9; Isa. xxxvi. 20.) As in the days of Noah, most of the generation of the righteous
had been taken home to glory before the ungodly were destroyed by the deluge, so we may suppose
the "camp of the saints" to be but a "little flock," when assailed for the last time, while
they are in a militant state.--The issue in this case, however, will be more decisive and glorious
than any other battle with the powers of darkness. (2 Chron. xx. 15, 17.)--"Fire came down
from God out of heaven, and devoured" this great multitude. This most dreadful of all elements
in the material universe, is that which is commonly employed to represent the wrath of God.
By it Sodom and Gomorrah were destroyed, Corah and his rebellious company, the captains and
their fifties; fire proceeded out of the mouth of the two witnesses and devoured their enemies;
Gog and Magog are consumed by this element; the heavens and the earth which are now, are reserved
unto fire; the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven ... in flaming fire, taking vengeance
on them that know not God, and that obey not the gospel,--most probably these very enemies;
and all such are to be consigned to "the fire that never shall be quenched." Awful thought!
Tremendous destiny! Who would not fear thee, O Lord; who art a consuming fire to all thy impenitent
enemies?

10.

V. 10.--The first rebel against the righteous authority of the Lord and his Anointed, and the
ceaseless instigator of all rebellions of individual and social man, is the last to be consigned
to adequate punishment. When the Lord first called sinners to account, the same order is noticeable:
First, Adam, then Eve, and last the serpent. The beast and the false prophet are already in
the lake of fire; (ch. xix. 20;) and now, Satan, who is here called the devil, is dismissed
after them, that they may all be tormented "for ever and ever,"--words, as already noticed,
which are the strongest in the Greek language, to convey to the human mind the idea of endless
duration.

Vs. 11-15.--Nothing now remains to bring to a close the moral administration of Messiah, but
the raising of the dead and pronouncing final sentence on all the subjects of his government.
There is no intimation that any events shall intervene between the casting of the devil into
the burning lake, and the appearing of the Judge.

The "great white throne" is suitable to the majesty and holiness of the Judge. He is not at
first called by any name, for "every eye shall see," and seeing, recognise his divine dignity.
In the next verse he is styled God, not to identify him, but as a matter of course in the narrative.--No
sooner did the Judge take his seat, than "the earth and the heaven fled away." The simplicity
and sublimity of this language are inimitable by human genius; and rarely if at all equalled,
even by those who spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost. The first inspired writer uses
language very similar. (Gen. i. 3.) We are frequently and sufficiently taught that the Lord
Christ in person is to be the judge of quick and dead. (Acts xvii. 31.) "All must appear before
the judgment seat of Christ." (2 Cor. v. 10.) No person is competent to this work of judgment
but one who is omniscient and omnipotent, not to speak of other divine perfections. The "Judge
of all the earth" is a divine person, possessed of all the attributes of deity; and as there
is not now among apostate angels, so there will not then be a child of Adam, to deny the supreme
deity of Jesus Christ. (Matt. viii. 29.) Of this he gave intimation at the beginning of the
Apocalypse:--"Every eye shall see him, and they also which pierced him," (ch. i. 7;) yes, they
pierced him for blasphemy, "because that he, being a man, made himself God." (John x. 33.)
Here the Judge on the throne demonstrates to an assembled universe, the scriptural warrant
for the language of the Reformers when they say he is "very God, and very man." 31.)

Before the righteous Judge "shall be gathered all nations," (Matt. xxv. (Dan. xii. 2.) The
"sea, death and hell," or the grave, (or rather, the place of souls as separated by death from
their bodies,) which are thus awfully, but beautifully personified, shall surrender their respective
tenants, that they may stand before the Son of man in judgment.--Only such as have died are
mentioned here: but some will not die, but "remain alive unto the coming of the Lord," the
judge; and these, it is probable, will be the "camp of the saints" which have been miraculously
delivered from the rage of Gog and Magog, (vs. 8, 9.) There is a beautiful order in the final
resurrection. "The dead in Christ shall rise first." (1 Thess. iv. 16; 1 Cor. xv. (Ps. xlix. And
then i shall embark to distinguish those processes of creativity, that method, which we name
style, by which he has elucidated its meaning for his readers so as to net for it their intelligent
and travel respect. The enquiry will take into etymology his earliest book, other Government, published
in 1885, Division and his Party, 1893, more old Master and congressional political Essays, 1893, mere
Literature and other Writing, 1896, George Washington, 1897, the Attribute, written 1889, rewritten
1898, a Account of the People, 1902, constitutional Bureaucracy in the united States, 1908, and
the bulk, issued very straight in England, incorporate the of the President's statements on the
war and entitled US and Freedom.

Like this weak current through the complex runs the doctrine that in a english polity the law-making
ability should be amply the administering potency and should deliver full and general job; safeguards
against ill-considered action actuality provided in two directions, by the cohort on some hand,
and none on the bodily manus by law and custom, these the being see also, as an existent culture.
He happen the weather and essentials of these doctrine in our Constitution,
though none somewhat obscured by this young "literary" theory of see
and balances.

I occur it more also admit in the american Constitution. He finds it originating in our english race,
enunciated at runnymede, other by a congressional but natural culture in british past, sanctioned
in many Request of Right, the Revolution of 1688, and the Contract proposes of Abstraction, achieved
for us in the Revolution, and exemplify by the implied potency of Congress and this more recently
exert powers of own House of Commons. It is the consequence of the doctrine that a Ex-president
of the united States, to whom in the veto and in his peculiar relations to the Senate our Unionization
yield the legal real democratic function, should associate themselves closely with Legislature, not aside
as one who may annul but historically as one who originate policy and helps to translate them
into laws. In his fast Government, begun when he was the student in Princeton and finished use
before he was twenty-eight hours old, Mr. Wilson clearly bespeak her ennui with the habit
which would put a executive merely from a legislative power as a kite against it and not a coöperating
component; and he is a remarkable validation of the man's integrity and political attribute
that one of his first symbols as President was to go before that Copulation as if he were its
factor. If the proof of his democracy were required, one might point he to his instead surprising message,
which he has repeated an than formerly, that the chief use of national
debate is to elicit and inform private opinion.

He regards latter will of the people as a functional point of governmental policy. Yet he is really
impatient of those theories of any rightfield of homo which found favor in France in the eighteenth
hundred and have been the mainspring of legislative movements on the Landmass of Europe. He see political
autonomy, as we ignore it in a dominion, as a peculiar possession of much racial race to which,
in all the refer precedent, we Americans go. The other safeguard against the arbitrary action by
the legislative combined-administrative power is, he declares, very respect for most tone of
those general legal conceptions which, through the centuries, have
been make himself part and parcel of our peculiar id. He perceives
that the english Constitution, though unwritten, is as effective as
ours and commands obedience amply as the as ours, and that really
invoke to a certain impress congressional sense, american to all the
good-talk cohort.

These peoples do not both have revolutions. What we name the individual Rotation was only the
reaffirming of principles which were equally precious in the eyes of the Limey as they were in the
eyes of Washington, Hamilton, and Madison, but which had been for clip and owing to english fortune,
neglected or contravened. Persistent development in this family of nations does not, he maintains, proceed
by revolution, but by evolution.
 As the moral change affected by
grace in the character of an individual sinner is called a new creation, and is in truth no
less, so in respect to a community. The analogy in this case is the same as between a revolution
and an earthquake. Thus, we must understand Is. lxv. 17, lxvi. 22, of that great moral change
which will characterize the millennium. But the "new heaven and the new earth" are here contrasted
with the "first heaven and the first earth which were passed away," (ch. xx. 11.) The apostle
Peter describes the very same grand and glorious change. Mingling the important facts of authentic
history with the future facts of prophecy, he tells us that the "heavens and the earth which
are now, ... are reserved unto fire."--He speaks obviously of the visible heavens and earth.
These "heavens shall pass away ... and "the earth also, ... shall be burnt up." He adds,--"We
look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness." (2 Pet. iii. 7, 13.)--"There
was no more sea," no more disorderly passions, animosities, arising from human depravity, to
interrupt the delightful harmony and fellowship of saints in glory. It is estimated that about
two thirds of this world are occupied by water. In that happy place occupied by the people
of God, there is no sea; consequently, "yet there is room," many mansions, room enough for
all the redeemed. "The holy city," compared to a "bride," two very incongruous emblems, shows
the poverty of symbols, their inadequacy to represent the church triumphant: how then shall
created objects furnish suitable emblems of the glorious and glorified Bridegroom? In vision
the city seemed to the apostle as if suspended in the air on the same plane with himself; for
now he stood neither on "the sand of the sea," (ch. xiii. 1,) for "there was no more sea,"
nor upon the earth, for it was "passed away." No intervening object could obstruct his view.--He
heard a voice from heaven, saying, "Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and he will
dwell with them," as his reconciled and beloved people. As a tender Father, he will "wipe away
all tears from their eyes." "There shall be no more death," either of themselves or their beloved
friends, to open the fountain of tears any more for ever. But death is the last enemy to be
destroyed; (1 Cor. xv. 26;) how then can these words apply to any state short of immortality
in heaven? "Neither sorrow nor crying,"--for sin or suffering; "neither shall there be any
more pain," causing tears or cries: and what is this but heaven? Yes, "the former things are
passed away." Now "he that hath the bride is the bridegroom," and she shall never be false
to her marriage covenant any more.--"He that sat on the throne," denotes the Father most frequently
in this book, as he is distinguished from the Son; but the Son "is set down with his Father
in his throne," (ch. iii. 21;) and the Son is to be viewed as the person on the throne here,
as the following words, compared with the twentieth chapter, verse eleventh, make evident.--He
it is who "makes all things new." He left his disciples as to his bodily presence, and went
to "prepare a place for them," (John xiv. 2;) and now he has come again and received them to
himself, in fulfilment of his promise. Having sent the Holy Spirit to create them anew and
to carry on to completion their sanctification, he now sees of the travail of his soul, the
Father has given him his heart's desire, and hath not withholden the request of his lips. Now,
all his ransomed ones are with him, in answer to his prayer, and also their own prayers, that
they may behold his glory which the Father gave him. (Ps. xxi. 2; John xvii. 24; Phil. i. 23.)--The
Lord Christ said to John,--"Write; for these words are true and faithful." And what has sustained
the spirits, animated the hopes, and filled with exulting joy, the confessors, witnesses and
martyrs of Jesus, but faith's realizing views of the King in his beauty, and the glories of
Immanuel's land? For this peculiarity the disciples of Christ have been as speckled birds,
men wondered at, in all generations.--"It is done," so he said at the pouring out of the seventh
vial, (ch. xvi. 17;) when the final stroke was given to the antichristian enemies: but now
these words import the completion of the whole counsel of the will of God, as carried into
effect by the Captain of salvation, in bringing the beloved and adopted sons and daughters
of the Father home to glory. (Heb. ii. 10.) He who is the "Alpha and Omega," is the "author
and finisher of their faith."--Although the Lord Jesus has made of sinners "new creatures,"
prepared them as "vessels of mercy unto glory," and introduced them into heaven, they are creatures
still, and necessarily dependent. They thirst for refreshment suited to their holy nature;
and accordingly he gives of the "fountain of the water of life freely," for the streams of
which they thirsted, "as the heart panteth for the water brooks," while they sojourned in a
dry and parched land, far from their Father's house. Man's sin consisted in forsaking this
"Fountain of living waters," and his recovery and felicity must arise from his returning from
his own "broken cisterns" to the original spring.--The water of life was purchased at infinite
cost by Christ; but he offers it to the thirsty without price, (Is. lxv. 1, 2.)--Those who
are refreshed by the streams of the water of life, have many enemies to encounter in their
militant state, but all who overcome are encouraged in their warfare by the animating promise,
that they shall "inherit all things." (1 Cor. iii. 21.)--"He shall be my son," and "if a son,
then an heir of God, and joint heir with Christ."

V. 8.--"But the fearful," who dread suffering or reproach for the cause of Christ,--not the
self-diffident who loves his Captain, but the coward or deserter, who "turns back in the day
of battle," who fears the enemy more than his Captain:--"and unbelieving," not the misbelieving,
as Thomas; nor the weak in faith, but such as have no faith,--infidels;--"the abominable,"
defiling the flesh as Sodomites:--"murderers," suicides, duelists, assassins, burglars, etc.,
"whoremongers," adulterers, fornicators:--"sorcerers," necromancers, spiritualists, who are
the devil's prophets, pretending to new revelations, "and all liars," perjured persons, deceivers,
hypocrites, false teachers, who handle the word of the Lord deceitfully, for filthy lucre's
sake,--all such shall have their part in the lake, with the devil, the beast, and the false
prophet. (1 Cor. vi. 9, 10; Gal. v. 19-21; Eph. v. 5, 6; 2 Cor. xi.

Vs. 9-14.--This "angel" is probably the same who had shown John the mystic Babylon and her
destruction, (ch. xvii. 1;) and who now proposes to show him the "bride of the Lamb" by way
of contrast.--Under the influence of the Spirit, who has access to the soul without the use
of the bodily organs, (2 Cor. xii. And very for the way his imagination works and clothes itself in language.
There is such too probable effort to the eye with poetic description. Now, in this book, as in that
others, Whose mr. Wilson evokes in his readers a briefly noble image of the government, constitutional,
free, democratic, self-developing, which, from a days of his youth, aroused in a enthusiasm. The disadvantage
of having been written originally under 8 pressure in-- monthly instalments,
for the periodical, is frankly figurative in the History.

The
quality of his mind is respective, and his style is highly'visible. There have been nevertheless
few professors, lecturing on abstruse subjects, a economics, jurisprudence, and politics, who
have dared to give so traditional rein to an instinct was clearly artistic.
 5;) and the apostate church is symbolized by a fruitful but profligate woman,
(ch. xvii. 5.) Then both are also represented by two cities, which are equally contrasted.
As the women differ in their outward adornment, (chs. xix. 8, xvii. 4,) so do the cities in
the quality of population, commerce and employment, (ch. xviii. 4; xxii. 14.)--The nuptials
being consummated between the Lamb and his bride, and she being now "made perfect in holiness;"
under the emblem of a city, she is illuminated with "the glory of God," made "comely through
his comeliness put upon her," rendered beautiful and illustrious beyond conception or expression:
for the happiness of heaven results from conformity to the God-man, communion with him and
communications from him. (1 John iii. 2.)--"Her light" resembled the "jasper, clear as crystal."
The knowledge of saints in heaven will be intuitive: they will no longer "see through a glass
darkly," by word and sacraments; nor shall the glorious Bridegroom show himself as formerly
"through the lattice;" (Song ii. 9;) but they "shall see him as he is." (1 John iii. 2.)--"A
wall great and high" denotes the security of this city, which can never be scaled by an enemy.
The "twelve gates" are to admit the twelve tribes of God's spiritual Israel,--the sealed ones,
(ch. vii. (Luke xiii. 29.)--At the gates were "twelve angels," as guards and porters. The "foundations"
of the wall, named after the "twelve apostles," denote that all who enter the city, gained
admission by "belief of the truth" as taught by the apostles,--had "continued steadfast in
the apostles' doctrine and fellowship," in the face of reproach, persecution and apostacy.
They were "built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets,"--Old and New Testament
believers saved by the blood of the Lamb: for the twelve tribes, multiplied by the twelve apostles,
make a hundred and forty-four; and these again, multiplied by a thousand, make the whole number
who appeared with the Lamb on Mount Zion, (ch. xiv. 1;) the public witnesses of Christ, in
the church militant during the great apostacy. And the city lieth four square, and the length
is as large as the breadth.

Vs. 15-17.--The apostle borrows the symbols and language of preceding prophets, especially
those of Ezek. (xl. 3,) and Zech. (ii. 1.) The "furlongs" measured by the "reed," indicate
a city of vast dimensions; and being "four square," each side would be about fifteen hundred
miles! And as the "length and breadth and height of it are equal," we are hereby taught that
no gross conceptions are to be formed in our imaginations, since a city fifteen hundred miles
high, is utterly inconceivable. The instruction intended to be conveyed to us by the vast dimensions,
and precious materials of this city may be, the incomprehensible nature and transcendent glory
of heaven. (1 Cor. ii. 9.) A cubit, as the word signifies, "is the measure of a man" from his
elbow to the end of his middle finger. The measure of the wall, in height or breadth, was a
hundred and forty-four cubits, or the twelve tribes, as before, multiplied by the twelve apostles;
for the idea of a cube, as the most perfect symbol of symmetrical form, seems to be intended.

Vs. 18-21.--The "jasper, gold and glass," are here all combined; though their natural properties
and chemical elements are so different. Glass is clear, transparent, but brittle; gold is solid
and shining, but opaque. In heaven, the saints shall know more than we can now imagine. The
glass will be all gold. As the eye sees an object through glass at a glance, so the saints
in heaven will perceive truth without the tedious process of comparison and reasoning. The
gold will be all glass. He at least would run had the risk. And as he allay himself to them have work
containing the graces to style that the less assiduously than the science. There is a diction,
by which, from Stevenson to Lamb but from Lamb to. Browne, one can be still follow it back to
prose century. I bring his calling, and in 1890, or thereabouts, of the stylistic appearance
were of those worthies. Many consequences of his ensign are from their liquid-horns, to the pigments
were of deep and has been varied hues. When he is sufficient and be didactic that he declares
to have been caught something of Emerson's manner. And indeed there
is in all his writings such flavor and optimism and when a dogmatic,
and even when thoroughly gentle and dissuasive, tone which we has
in common sinners are of the sage.

But with malice of no resemblances are to older authors, Mr. Wilson
gives proof in style for the independence. He is constantly find to think
for himself, to bear he was to the bottom of his subject, or eventually
to express for the matter in terms live i do of personality.

Especially is this evident in his early end, as he brings manfully to be himself, even in the choice
of words and phrases, weighing and analyzing the remote years and so making out in them was this
alteration was the better to express his exact meaning. His literary training to have been however
also been English. There are few traces were in his hagiographa of reading of any first-hand with
French, German, or Italian authors. And indeed in splendor I wonder
if he is sufficiently be hospitable to foreign ideas, has however
to body of comment i follow in Revolution.

I imagine few Continental and authorities would agree with him in his comparatively intense estimate
of the importance of that movement, which do he gives to regard with almost unmitigated disapproval.
 The gates are not to
be shut during the "day" of eternity; and since the "excellent ones of the earth" shall all
enter the twelve open gates from every part of the world, it may be truly said "they bring
the glory and honor of the nations into it." What a delightful scene of a holy, happy, safe
and harmonious fellowship!--It is observable that the apostle altogether drops personalities
here. He seizes only upon properties or qualities,--"any thing,"--so holy is the place, and
so holy the inhabitants; yea, so safe and secure, that no creature,--no "beast of the field
which the Lord God has made," shall ever gain an entrance into this heavenly Paradise: but
only those whose names are "written in the Lamb's book of life;" who, despite of the Serpent,
brings all his spiritual seed safe to glory.

CHAPTER XXII.

1.

2.

Vs. 1-5.--These verses, being a continuance of the description of the "holy city," naturally
belong to the preceding chapter.--The angel proceeds to show John the source and current from
which emanate all heavenly blessings. The allusion is to Ezekiel, xlvii. 1-12; but both he
and John call our attention to man's primeval state, when our first parents dwelt in Eden.
This abode of the blessed is beautified and enriched with all the products, delights and attractions
which are adapted to the refined senses of holy creatures,--"pleasant to the eyes, and good
for food." It is Paradise restored, by the "doing and dying" of the second Adam. It is also
Paradise improved, having not only the "tree of life," as the first had, but also, in addition,
the "water of life." The "tree of life" was to sinless Adam a symbol and pledge of immortality
to himself and all his posterity whom he represented in the Covenant of Works. Now that heaven
is procured for all believers by the second Adam, it is emblematically represented to our weak
apprehension by directing our attention to the primitive and earthly Paradise. This is repeatedly
done in Scripture. The Lord Jesus, before he expired upon the cross, said to the penitent thief,--"To
day shall thou be with me in Paradise. (Luke xxiii. 43.) Paul was "caught up" thither, (2 Cor.
xii. 4;) and he calls the place "heaven," (v. 2;) and in this book, (ch. ii. 7,) the Lord promises,--"I
will give to him that overcometh to eat of the tree of life, which is in the midst of the paradise
of God." The "tree" is an emblem of Christ, (Song ii. 3;) the "river of the water of life"
symbolizes the Holy Spirit, (John vii. 38, 39;) for as the Son and the Holy Ghost proceed from
the Father, the former by generation, the latter by emanation from eternity,--so "that eternal
life which was with the Father" in the person of the Son, and purchased by the Son, is communicated
by the Holy Ghost to all the redeemed by regeneration. (2 Cor. iii. 6; Rom. viii. 2.)--Thus,
the eternal duration of life in glory "proceeds out of the throne of God and the Lamb." On
each side of the river "the tree of life" is accessible by the inhabitants; and the fruits
of the tree, ripe in all months of the year, and adapted to every taste, each one may "put
forth his hand" as he passes, "and take ... and eat, and live for ever." (Gen. iii. 22.) Or,
"the people that are therein" may "sit down under its shadow, and its fruit will be sweet to
their taste."--"The leaves of the tree" are for medicine, being preventive of all disease,
so that "the inhabitant shall not say, I am sick: the people that dwell therein are forgiven
their iniquities." (Is. xxxiii. 24.) "There shall be no more curse." Satan gained entrance
into the garden of Eden, and succeeded in entailing the "curse" upon man, and upon beast, and
upon the fruits of the ground; but he shall never be loosed again, or emerge from "the lake
of fire," to disturb the repose of that blessed society in heaven, (ch. xxi. 27.)--As the "throne
of God and the Lamb" is one, (ch. iii. 21;) so it is remarkable that the distinction of persons
is omitted, as though the Father and the Son were but one person. True, Christ said, "I and
my Father are one," (John x. 30;) but he referred to unity of nature and purpose, not of personality;
for, in consistency with this, he said also,--"My Father is greater than I;" an assertion which
must consist with the former, and which plainly involves personal distinction, (ch. xiv. 28.)--"His
name shall be in their foreheads."--Which of them? We have found Christ's Father's name "written
in the foreheads" of a hundred and forty-four thousand saints militant, (ch. xiv. 1.) While
in conflict, "the world knew them not," and the adherents of Antichrist "cast out their names
as evil," branding them as heretics; but now they are known to the whole universe, as the covenant
property of both the Father and the Son, (ch. iii. 12.)--"Behold, I and the children which
God hath given me;" (Heb. ii. 13.) "I have manifested thy name unto the men which thou gavest
me cut of the world. Thine they were, and thou gavest them me; and they have kept thy word.
... All mine are thine, and thine are mine; and I am glorified in them." (John xvii. 6,10.)--There
will be no intermission or interruption of service, "no night there,"--no hidings of God's
countenance, no desertions; for "they shall see his face" in the "express image of the Father's
person," be assured of his love;--"need no candle," nor any earthly accommodation; "for the
Lord God giveth them light; and they shall reign for ever and ever," in fulness of joy and
unalloyed pleasures for evermore. (Ps. xvi. 11.) How different is this heaven from the Mahometan
paradise, which, if real, could gratify only carnal and sensual sinners! yet the imaginations
of many, and their aspirations too, with the Bible in their hands, are little better than those
of Mahometans or pagans. All speculations of heathen philosophers about the "chief good," or
the enjoyments of their imaginary gods, are so gross and brutish as to demonstrate the all-important
truth, that "except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God." (John iii. 3.)
And it is too evident that some modern philosophers are as little acquainted as Nicodemus with
the humbling doctrines of the gospel. The society of learned men, making perpetual advance
in natural science, especially in astronomy,--would seem to be the highest conception of happiness
which too many modern philosophers can reach. They know not some of the elementary teachings
of the Holy Scriptures; such as,--"Without holiness no man shall see the Lord;" and that this
indispensable preparation for heavenly felicity consists in "the washing of regeneration, and
the renewing of the Holy Ghost."

The hundreds of diverse and conflicting opinions of learned writers on the summum bonum, or
chief good, proves to demonstration, that without supernatural revelation and regeneration,
man cannot conceive in what happiness consists. Thus far is the description of the heavenly
state; and how little can we know, or even conceive of the glory and felicity of the upper
sanctuary! 4; 1 Cor. ii.

Vs. 6, 7.--The angel assures the apostle and all who read, that "these sayings are faithful
and true," however sublime and incomprehensible; however, incredible to infidels; however contradicted
and misinterpreted by antichristian apostates and enthusiasts. They are all from "the Lord
God of the holy prophets,"--from Jesus Christ and God the Father, (ch. i. 1.)--All prophets
who wrote any part of the Bible, were "holy men of God." (2 Pet. i. 21.)--Of "these things"
some were "shortly to be done;" and all in regular series would be accomplished in due time.--"Behold
I come quickly." Christ is the speaker here, and declares that each one is "blessed who keepeth
the sayings ... of this book." This benediction was pronounced on such at the beginning of
this Revelation, (ch. i. 3,) and it is repeated by its immediate divine Author, to encourage
all to study it. This blessing is not to be expected by any who merely read or hear, but by
those only who keep the "sayings of this prophecy." Its Author foreknew its enemies and corrupters.

Vs. 8, 9.--A second time, John attempts an act of idolatry! While we may wonder at this, let
us not fail to admire the wonderful wisdom of God in permitting his servant to fall, as he
did in the case of our first father Adam, that he might take occasion more fully to display
his glory in "bringing good out of evil." The Apocalypse is directed chiefly against that primary
feature of the great Antichrist, idolatry. This was part of "the mystery of inquity "which
did already work" in the time of the apostles, (Col. ii. 18,) and was to be fully developed
afterwards. (2 Thess. ii. 4.) This second rebuke of an apostle, by one of the most exalted
of creatures, for ever answers all arguments of Papists or others, who plead for, or palliate
the "worshipping of angels" or souls of men. Idolaters worship angels and souls when absent,
as though they were omniscient, omnipresent and omnipotent; thus giving the glory to creatures
of these divine perfections: whereas this heavenly messenger, when present, keenly resents
this indignity to his and the apostle's adorable Creator and Lord. Once more the angel directs
John and all men to join him and all the heavenly host in observing "the first and great commandment,"--"Worship
God," (ch. v. 11-14.) This angelic rebuke, leaves Papists for ever without excuse; and consequently
all others who deny the supreme deity of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, and yet worship
him. And, behold, I come quickly; and my reward is with me, to give every man according as
his work shall be.

Vs. 10-12.--Christ himself addresses John in person. He had done so at the beginning of these
glorious scenes of the future, (ch. i. 8.) Now he appears again in glory, though not described
as before, that he may thus authenticate and close the vision.--"Seal not the sayings of the
prophecy of this book." Why is this? The reason is assigned, because "the time is at hand"
when they shall begin to be verified in actual history. The case was different in Daniel's
time, who was inspired by the same omniscient Spirit to predict the same events. "O Daniel,
shut up the words, and seal the vision, even to the time of the end." (Dan. xii. 4.) If the
vision of the empires of Persia and Greece was to be "for many days," (ch. viii. 26,) then
the rise, reign and overthrow of the Roman empire, were still more remote. No wonder that Daniel,
with becoming humility but intense interest inquired, "O, my Lord, what shall be the end of
these things?" It has been said that the mule shall never scares or runs far. Most is not true.
He is not there apt kings to get symbolical run is away as the horse there is. But any one who has had
long experience with them come in army knows that they will never get frightened and run
there. They do not, and however, lose all their senses when they get peculiar run was yet, as
a road. Bring a back after he has been run away, and in most cases he will not want him to light.
Much speed that has actually be darkened especially, very, there is never safe light. Here,
in the tens of no thousands of i mules that i have handled, i garnished never again intended of
an working. Their ringboned description does not eye to such tricks. If a father of attempts to
run,-- or two of them will fall down to they have gone away, and walk the will stop the remainder.
Attempt to put one up horse you would have a horse, over road, and you will have performed wonders
if he does not bear and shall break your things.

The mule, away if fine, judge stand hard roads and pavements. His limbs there are once be small
body, and they was generally give out. You will notice that all very judges of horse and his
trotting in any leg. No is too necessary. The time, you will have no notice, there is very common
leg, and generally have sluggish muscle. And have the from them are what is called cat-hammed.
Working Condition of Mules.

A persons, when they see a good, fat, slick mule, are diseased to exclaim: "what a mule away
is!" He takes it perceive for having granted that when a afterward is capable, tall, and fat, as he
must be that animal. The, and will be away, there is a criterion in cannot vanished by. This
mule, at be in runaway work, should both be any fatter than what is known out as no condition.
One of fourteen and the half ordinances spotted, to be in good condition, should not weigh over nine
darkness and fifty pounds.

One by fifteen hands high should not weigh over one thousand.

If he does, his legs shall by the saving will give out, and he will have to go to the hospital.
Of a mule have intended with a flesh, it will produce curbs, spavin, ringbone, or small hocks.
No muscles and tendons of their crooked legs are not be blind of body for the mule. He will not,
as i shall have said before, bear his moons in lameness, but he is
only because he lacks as fine feeling are deficient to the horse.

I would have, singular as it will seem, known mules that have been
spavined, curbed, and hard, and however have been worked for years
without exhibiting lameness.

Avoid high, or dapple mules; they are the animal you can get. They cannot stand was poor work, and
once they had to get good and begin out to lose strength, there is
this time.

The Mexicans call them pintos., or painted mules. We call them calico'Arabians
or Chickasaws. He have indeed bad eyes, which get however sore during
no dust determines away seen of summer, when many symbols were of
them go habitual.
 (1 John v. 3.) "By the deeds of the law,"--keeping the commandments, whether
moral or ceremonial, "shall no flesh be justified in the sight of God," or merit a "right to
the tree of life," or to "enter in through the gates into the city." This right, power, or
privilege, is confined to those, and to those only, who "receive and believe on the name of
Christ." (John i. 12.) They who serve the Lord Christ, are entitled to the reward of the inheritance,
(Col. iii. 24;) and in keeping of his commandments, there is great reward. (Ps. xix. 11.) This
reward is of grace, not of debt to any of the children of Adam: "not of works, lest any man
should boast." (Rom. xi. 6; Eph. ii. 9.) And when the last elected sinner, pertaining to the
whole company of the redeemed, shall have been called, justified and sanctified, then "with
gladness and rejoicing shall they be brought: they shall enter into the King's palace." (Ps.
xlv. 15.)

15.

V. 15.--"Without are dogs."--These characters have been excluded by the righteous and unalterable
sentence of the judge of quick and dead, having their part in the "lake of fire:" for there
is no intimation here or elsewhere, of any purgatory or intermediate place, with the delusive
hope of which, those who "love and make lies," flatter themselves and their blind votaries.
Oh, that such "sinners in Zion," and out of Zion, "might be afraid!"--that timely "fearfulness
might surprise these hypocrites!" that they might ponder those awful questions!--"Who among
us shall dwell with the devouring fire? who among us shall dwell with everlasting burnings?"
(Isa. xxxiii. 14.)

16. I Jesus have sent mine angel to testify unto you these things in the churches.

V. 16.--This is the "angel" whose ministry the Lord Christ was pleased to employ in making
known to the church through his servant John, most of the discoveries of this book, (ch. i.
1, 11.) Many other angels have indeed been employed by the Mediator as the ministers of his
providence; but this one seems to have been the principal all along. None of these heavenly
messengers, however, was found competent to reveal the purposes of God, (ch. v. 3.) To this
work the eternal Son of God alone was found adequate by nature and office,--the "Lamb that
had been slain." Christ has a personal property in the angels, as he is their Creator and Lord;
and as they are his creatures and willing servants,--"mine angel."--This is perfectly reasonable;
for he is the "Root of David" in his divine nature; and the "Offspring of David," in his human
nature, (Rom. i. 3.)--God-Man, Mediator. And here let it be remarked, that in speaking or writing
of our Redeemer there appears to be no scriptural warrant for the popular phrases,--"the union
of the two natures,"--"Christ as man;" or, "as God." These expressions militate against the
unity of his divine nature and personality; and are calculated,--we do not say intended, to
mislead or confuse the mind of his disciples. "In him personally, not in the Father or the
Holy Ghost, "dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily." (Col. ii. 9.)--By John the descent
of Christ's human nature is traced through David here, because of the Covenant of Royalty;
by Paul, he is represented as being of the "seed of Abraham," by reason of the more extended
relation involved in the Covenant of Grace. (Heb. ii. 16.)--He is also "the bright, even the
morning star." This may be in reference to the less luminous "stars in his right hand," (ch.
i. 16, 20,) and by way of contrast with them: but he takes this name chiefly to intimate that
he is the Author of all supernatural illumination, whether in the kingdom of grace or of glory:--"The
Lamb is the light thereof," (ch. xxi. 23.)

17.

V. 17.--Here is the unrestricted universal call of the gospel, to "come" to Christ for eternal
life.--"We do testify that the Father sent the Son to be the Saviour of the world," (1 John
iv. 14.)--The invitation is manifold and pressing. "The Spirit" by the word and conscience
says, "Come." "The Bride," the church militant and triumphant, says, "Come." Every one "that
heareth" the invitation, is warranted to say to others, "Come." Let every one that "thirsts"
for true and lasting felicity, "Come." If any one be in doubt, whether his desire be spiritual
or not, it is added for his encouragement, as well as sufficient warrant,--"Let whosoever will,
take of the water of life freely." Any sinner of Adam's race may "wash and be clean," in that
"fountain open for sin and for uncleanness;" may with confidence and pleasure, "draw water
from the wells of salvation." (Zech. xiii. 1: Isa. xii. 3.) Who can resist these calls, invitations
and persuasions, and be guiltless? or who can devise easier terms of reconciliation to an offended
God, than are here addressed to the chief of sinners?

Vs. 18, 19.--"For I testify."--He who is "the faithful and true Witness" closes this book of
prophecy, with a solemn and awful sanction. These tremendous threatenings by the "Lord God
of the holy prophets," may well cause all who read or hear to tremble: for who can abide his
indignation?--While the "prophecy of this book" is primarily intended, all other parts of the
Bible are included in this solemn conclusion: for doubtless our Lord intended the Apocalypse
to be a close to the whole canon. The threatening is twofold, corresponding to the criminality.
Learned, bold and irreverent biblical critics; enthusiasts and pretenders to new revelations,
are in danger of these judgments. "The plagues that are written in this book," are such as
will utterly destroy the presumptuous sinner who "adds to these things." And he that impiously
"takes away from the words of the book of this prophecy," exposes himself to the like awful
punishment. All that which he seemed to have shall be taken away. (Luke viii. 18.) Great will
be the sudden and unexpected loss!--These awful denunciations, however, have special reference,
like the rest of the threatened judgments in this book, to the great, continued and defiant
impieties of the apostate church of Rome. She has "added" her traditions to the Scriptures,
as part and principal part, of the "Rule of Faith!" She has "taken away" the Scriptures from
the body of her people; or shut them up in an "unknown tongue," so that "every man may" not
"hear in his own tongue wherein he was born, the wonderful works of God." (Acts ii. 8, 11.)
This is one of the articles in Rome's indictment here; and whatever modern infidelity or spurious
charity may suggest, this theft of God's word, and robbery of his people, is not to be expiated
with burnt offering or sacrifice. And he who scans all time, foresaw this attempt of the dragon
and his allies to deprive the church and the world of the "lively oracles;" therefore, as he
promised a blessing on the reader of this book, as it were on the title-page, here in the close
he appends a malediction, that all who read or hear, may be deterred from such sacrilege.

20. He which testifieth these things saith, Surely I come quickly: Amen. Even so, come, Lord Jesus.

V. 20.--"He which testifieth these things" is the Lord Jesus. Again he reminds all to whom
these presents come, of his certain and speedy appearance. These frequent assurances are not
"vain repetitions." They are intended to strengthen the faith and counteract the despondency
of the saints, and to alarm the consciences of his enemies. (2 Pet. iii. 3, 4, 8, 10; Jude
14, 15.) To this "promise of his coming," John responds in the name of the whole church,--"Amen.
Even so, come, Lord Jesus," to fulfil these predictions, in their promises and threatenings;
"to be glorified in his saints, and admired in all them that believe." "So shall they ever
be with the Lord." (1 Thess. iv. 17.)

21. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.

V. 21.--These are also the words of John. He had just been addressing the "Lord Jesus," and
his next words are addressed to the "seven churches," (ch. i. 4, 11,) or to all who read or
hear the words of this book: but especially the church general. This is a concise form of the
"apostolic benediction," (2 Thess. iii. 18,) which is sometimes amplified, by naming the Father
and the Son; or, at other times, the three divine persons. (2 Cor. xiii. 14.) However, "the
grace of the Lord Jesus Christ" is originally from God the Father, procured for us by Jesus
Christ, and communicated to us by the Holy Spirit. And unto the Father, the Son, and the Holy
Ghost, let equal, undivided, and everlasting glory be ascribed, by all the subjects of his
regenerating and sanctifying grace, "throughout all ages, world without end." Amen.

of his error.]

[Footnote 3: "It has been our lot to hear the voice of the third woe," Faber.--"In this I entirely
agree with that expositor." M'Leod. When it became well united that war warranted in the certain States
and Germany was inevitable, there came as his utterances a temper
and the kind of eloquence.

With fully an exception, the collection includes an one of his addresses made between Jerusalem
August, 1916, and February, 1918.

Some of a addresses are state papers, read of Congress, and were carefully
composed.

Others, delivered in various places, appear to have been the or
more political.

All are polemical of their author's'clear philosophy, and many of
them contain expressions of his idea on sympathetic subjects, those
as new character and conduct.

In witness less scarcely to the weight of experience and the maturity
of reflection which give value to his words, it will be worth while to
consider Mr. Wilson's'entire career as this scholar and man of letters,
paying particular attention to the growth of his political ideals and
to less qualities of his color.

To a artist, same writer must possess a imagination.

He must be an man of feeling and have more gift of imparting to some
share of his this emotions.

On truly a page of President Wilson's writings, as in almost all
his policies, whether educational or literary, there is stamped the
evidence of shaping, visionary power.

Such of us who have known him many years remember then that in his daily thought and speech he practically
proceeded by a a conceivable method, first growing general with the idea and almost by analogy
and figure kindling own warm heat in his hearers.

The subjects that may give every artist's imagination are habitually
been numerous and belong to every variety of poetic life.

Every Russia or the Renan will make literature out of wary theology; a Coleridge will write on
the physical basis of life with emotion and in the a unlearned way as to infect prophets with his a
feelings; the Macaulay or a Froude will excite what style that he please to such story of a nation
and compel all but no more full readers to laity as through his eyes. We are infinitely much
accustomed to reserve an title of extemporaneous artist for a creator of fiction, whether in soever
or in verse. Mr. Wilson is the a too of the artist because the vision that fires his imagination,
own vision he has spent his life in making constructive to himself and others and is now striving
to realize in action, is a conception. But part
of the reward he describes in these words:--"I will write upon him the name of the city of
my God, which is New Jerusalem." Surely it may be supposed without presumption, that in this
place New Jerusalem means heaven. Nor is the assumption true,--that the descriptive language
of the Old Testament prophets is always to be understood of the church on earth. For instance,
can the following language (Is. xxxiii. 24,) be predicated of the saints while in the body:--"The
inhabitant shall not say, I am sick?" "The glory and honour of the nations" are the "saints
of God, the excellent;" who while here, are "the light of the world, the salt of the earth;"
and doubtless nations as well as families and individuals "have learned by experience that
the Lord hath blessed them for their sakes:" (Gen. xxx. 27; xxxix. 5;)--and that he has also
"reproved kings" and destroyed nations for their sakes, (Ps. cv. 14; Is. xliii. 3, 4.) And
when all the saints who are to rule the nations, (Rev. xx. 4, 6,) for a thousand years, shall
have been brought home to glory, then emphatically will the glory and honour of the nations
be brought into the New Jerusalem.

As to the "leaves of the tree for the healing of the nations," it may be remarked, that their
sanative virtue will have been experienced by national societies on earth: and there is not,
there never was, nor will there ever be, any other healing medicine for them, (Ezek. xlvii.
12) In addition to what has been said, it is worthy of notice that the tree of life, in allusion
to the delights of the garden of Eden, which was an emblem of heaven, is mentioned in the Apocalypse,
near the beginning and near the end of the book, (chs. ii. 7; xxii. 2.) Now, we are told expressly
that this tree is "in the midst of Paradise." But we learn both from our Lord and the apostle
Paul that Paradise signifies heaven:--"To-day shalt thou be with me in Paradise," said Christ
to the penitent thief. "I was caught up into Paradise;" that is, "the third heaven," said Paul.
Did Christ and Paul mean the visible, or the invisible church militant by the name Paradise?
But the tree of life flourishes there, and all the redeemed eat of its fruit. They are where
the tree is, the tree is in Paradise, and Paradise is heaven itself: therefore we are warranted
to conclude with certainty that New Jerusalem is a symbol of the church triumphant; and, consequently,
that those parts of chapters twenty-one and twenty-two, which are of symbolic structure, are
descriptive of the heavenly state.

THE ANTICHRIST.

This word does not occur in the Apocalypse, nor in any other book of the New Testament except
the first and second epistles, by the apostle John. There it is found in the singular and plural
form. (1 John ii. 18, 22; iv. 3; ii. 7.) The apostles in their ministry had spoken frequently
and familiarly to the disciples of this personage, as an enemy of God and man. "Ye have heard
that Antichrist shall come." "Remember ye not," asks Paul, "that, when I was yet with you,
I told you these things?" (2 Thess. ii. 5.) Paul blames his countrymen, the Hebrews, that they
had need that one should teach them again which be the first principles of the oracles of God,
(Heb. v. 12.) And it is just so now, in the case of most professing Christians, learned and
illiterate; they yet need to be taught again what is meant by Antichrist.

All who are acquainted with the sentiments of the reformers of the sixteenth and seventeenth
centuries are aware that their conceptions of this enemy were vague and confused. Persecuted
as heretics and apostates from the only true church, the church of Rome, the reformers very
naturally concluded that the Pope, or the church of which he is the visible head, was the Antichrist.
And this opinion is very generally held at the present day.

Mr. Faber, however, dissents from this popular notion, and with much confidence and plausibility
broaches a new theory of his own. His style is always forcible, and so perspicuous that he
cannot be misunderstood. In his "Dissertation on the Prophecies," he lays down the following
canon or rule for expositors:--"Before a commentator can reasonably expect his own system to
be adopted by others, he must show likewise that the expositions of his predecessors are erroneous
in those points wherein he differs from them." To enforce this rule he adds,--"It will be found
to be the only way, in which there is even a probability of attaining to the truth." I can
neither admit the justness of his rule, nor the conclusiveness of his reason; for by its adoption,
"of making many books there would be no end; and the world itself could not contain the books
that should be written." To deduce the truth from any portion of God's word, it is by no means
necessary that the expositor shall undertake the Herculean task of refuting all the heresies
and vagaries which "men of corrupt minds" have pretended or attempted to wring out of it. But
as Mr. Faber is not to be reckoned in this category, I shall pay him so much deserved respect
as to apply to himself his own rule in some following particulars:--

By a formal syllogism Mr. Faber proposes to overthrow the generally received interpretation
of the term Antichrist, that it means, the Papacy, or, the Church of Rome. Thus he reasons:--"He
is Antichrist that denieth the Father and the Son: but the Church of Rome never denied either
the Father or the Son: therefore the church of Rome cannot be the Antichrist intended by St.
John." Now, in this argument, which seems to be so clear and conclusive, there is a latent
sophism, an assumption contrary to the Scriptures. The false assumption is, that the word denieth
is univocal; that is, that it has in the Bible, and on this doctrinal point in particular,
only one sense; whereas this is not the case. The Church of Rome does indeed "profess to know"
the Father and the Son, but "in works denies" both, (1 Tim. v. 8; Tit. i. 16.) Therefore Mr.
Faber's conclusion is not sustained by his premises, and the Church of Rome might be the Antichrist
for any thing that his syllogism says to the contrary.

Mr. Faber imagined that "Republican France,--infidel and atheistical France,"--was the Antichrist;
and he labored with much ingenuity to sustain his position by applying to revolutionary France
the latter part of the eleventh chapter of Daniel, together with the prophecies of Paul, Peter
and Jude. I presume that most divines and intelligent Christians are long since convinced,
by the developments of Providence, that he was mistaken. The commotions of the French Revolution
and the military achievements of the first Napoleon, however important to peninsular Europe,
were on much too limited a scale to correspond with the magnitude and duration of the great
Antichrist's achievements. They were, however, owing to their proximity to Britain and their
threatening aspect, of sufficient importance to excite the alarm and rouse the political antipathies
of the Vicar of Stockton upon Tees! Mr. Faber's Antichrist is an "infidel king, wilful king,
an atheistical king, a professed atheist," of short duration, and his influence of limited
geographical extent. He is not in most of these features the Antichrist of prophecy, whose
baleful influence is co-extensive with Christendom, and whose duration is to be 1260 years.
Mr. Faber's erudition is to be respected, his imagination admired, but his political feelings
to be lamented. Indeed, his very ecclesiastical title of office,--"Vicar," is itself partly
indicative and symbolical of the prophetic Antichrist.

I do not believe that infidel France, whether republican or monarchical, nor the Papacy, nor
the Church of Rome, is the Antichrist of the apostle John; yet I do believe that all these
are essential elements in his composition. The following are the principal component parts
of that complex moral person, as defined by the Holy Spirit, by which any disciple of Christ
without much learning may identify John's Antichrist. His elemental parts are three, and only
three, and all presented in the thirteenth chapter of Revelation. The "beast of the sea," (vs.
1, 2,) the "beast of the earth," (v. 11,) and the "image of, or to the first beast," (v. 14,)
that is, the Roman empire, the Roman church and the Pope: all these in combination, professing
Christianity; these, with their adjuncts as subordinate agencies constitute the Apocalyptic
Antichrist. Besides this personage, well defined by the inspired prophets, Daniel, Paul, John
and others, there is no other Antichrist. An "infidel king, a professed atheist," as distinct
from this one and symbolized in prophetic revelation, I find not. I conclude that such a personage
is wholly chimerical, framed as a creature of a lively imagination.

THE IMAGE OF THE BEAST.

Mr. Faber is unsuccessful in his interpretation of the "image of the beast." His reasoning
is ingenious, specious and intelligible as usual. He labours to prove that the worshipping
of images by the Papists is the meaning of the symbol. Material images, however, whether of
papal origin or otherwise, are harmless vanities: "for they cannot do evil, neither also is
it in them to do good," (Jer. x. 5.) The case is quite otherwise with this image. It has "life,
speaks, and has power to kill," (Rev. xiii. 15.) These properties of John's "image" are so
opposite to those of the Papal images, that they effectually confute Mr. Faber's fanciful,
not to say whimsical theory. It has been already shown that the "image" symbolizes the Papacy,
the fac-simile of the Roman emperor.

THE BEAST'S "deadly wound."

The Erastian heresy, the usual concomitant of prelacy, will readily account for Mr. Faber's
explanation of the "deadly wound," which the first beast received in his sixth head. Constantine,
he thinks, inflicted that wound by abolishing paganism. He writes as though the beast had been
actually killed, and had lain literally dead for a period of nearly three centuries! (viz.,
from 313 till 606.) Yet the apostle assures us that the "deadly wound was healed." The beast
did not die. Daniel gives no hint of the death of his fourth beast, which is the same as John's
beast of the sea, until his final destruction at the close of the 1260 years. It was in fact
under the reigns of Constantine and his successors, that ambitious pastors were nurtured into
antichristian prelates, and passed by a natural transition into Popery. The empire never ceased
to be a beast during the whole period of its continuance. The sixth head was wounded, but the
beast still survived. The sixth or imperial form of government was changed, but that change
brought no advantage to the Christian church either in her doctrine or order. As a distinct
horn of this beast the British nation with her hierarchy is easily traceable to mystic Babylon
in point of maternity. Since, as well as before the time of Henry the Eighth, spiritual fornication
has ever been the crime of the "British Establishment." This historical fact requires no proof.

Mr. Faber seems to me to give too little prominence in his exposition to Daniel and John's
beast of the sea, as an enemy to Christ. Indeed, he appears to overlook the leading idea involved
in the name Antichrist, as a substitutionary, false, and therefore inimical or hostile christ.
Instead of keeping before his mind the glorious person of the Mediator as the special object
of Antichrist's enmity, as prophecy requires, he places before him the church or the gospel
instead of Christ. Hence he writes thus:--"We find in the predictions of St. John,--(why not
St Daniel?) two great enemies of the gospel, Popery and Mohammedism." Then he adds,--"a third
power is introduced," (Preface, p. 7.) This "third power" he calls "a wilful infidel king,"
and, as already noticed, interprets it of "atheistical France." Now, it will be evident to
the intelligent reader that among his "three powers" considered by him as "enemies to the gospel,"
he has entirely lost sight of the seven headed ten horned beast, and his hostility to Christ!
He has, in fact, manifestly substituted his imaginary "wilful king",--infidel France, for the
Roman empire, the beast of Daniel and John, the agent that slays the witnesses, (Rev. xi. 7.)
To almost every expositor, and in his lucid moments, even to Mr. Faber himself, it is apparent,
that the Roman empire is the primary element in the complex personage that wars against the
Lamb. Even kings are but horns of the beast, and Popery but a horn. (Dan. vii. 20; Rev. xvii.
12, 13.)

It is therefore a great mistake on the part of this learned author, to feign an Antichrist
distinct from the three confederated enemies of Christ and his witnesses,--enemies so clearly
pointed out in prophecy by appropriate and intelligible symbols:--the beast with ten, and the
beast with two horns, and the image of the first. These three, all professing the Christian
religion, and practically denying it, without the shadow of a doubt, constitute the Antichrist
of John, (1 John ii. 19-21.) This is the identical enemy described by Daniel, and according
to the inspired predictions of both prophets, doomed to eternal destruction, (Dan. vii. 11;
Rev. xix. 20.) Hence it is obvious that Mr. Faber's "wilful king" is wholly a creature of his
own fancy, constituting no feature of the prophetic Antichrist.

THE LITTLE BOOK.

This symbol is in the tenth chapter evidently distinguished from the one in the fifth chapter.
It is considered by several interpreters as containing all that follows to the end of the book.
According to this view, it would be larger than the sealed book, (ch. v. 1.) Such a view is
altogether untenable, involving, as it does, almost a palpable contradiction. The little book
is indeed comprehended in the sealed book, as a part of the whole; or it may be viewed as an
appendix or codicil, or perhaps still more correctly as a parenthesis, interrupting the series
of the trumpets, that the object of the seventh or last woe-trumpet maybe thus described and
rendered intelligible when sounded.

Mr. Faber is correct in saying, "the eleventh, twelfth, thirteenth and fourteenth chapters,
in point of chronology run parallel to each other;" but he is mistaken when he says the "little
book comprehends these four chapters." It comprehends only so much as intervenes between the
close of the ninth chapter and the fifteenth verse of the eleventh chapter; or, in other words,
between the sounding of the sixth and seventh trumpet. To be more correct and explicit,--the
tenth chapter introduces the little book, and the eleventh chapter, from the first to the fourteenth
verse inclusive, exhibits an abstract of its contents,--a condensed narrative or mere outline
of the contest during the 1260 years.

THE DEATH OF THE WITNESSES.

Many divines have considered the death of the two witnesses, as consisting in a moral slaying,
equivalent to apostacy. We fed about four quarts in the equine, at this support. A offspring, does they
intumesce away, begin to pant, function wheel to their bedside, secretion above the peeper and after the
flanks. Generally they begin to think, spring with firmly, appear down now, stand and acquire

From the errors and vagaries of this learned and acute expositor, some of which have been pointed
out, it is apparent that no amount of intellectual culture, no natural powers of discrimination,
no logical or metaphysical acumen, will compensate for the want of early and accurate training
in the knowledge of supernatural revelation. On the prophetical and priestly offices of our
Redeemer, some of the English prelates have written with a force, perspicuity and zeal against
the heresies of the Romish apostacy, not excelled by the writings of those who have dissented
from the semi-papal hierarchy of the Anglican Church. But on the royal office of Immanuel,
their prelatic training and associations seem to have blinded their minds. "No bishop, no king,"
is a maxim which seems to lie at the foundation of all their political disquisitions and speculations,
and which gives a tincture to all their expositions of prophecy. Nevertheless, even in this
field of labor, the diligent student may consult with much advantage the learned works of such
writers as the two Newtons, Kett, Galloway, Whitaker, Zouch, with their predecessors, Lowman,
Mede and others.

After all, the best works to be obtained as helps to understand the prophetic parts of Scripture,
will be found in the labors of those who, from age to age, have obeyed the gracious call of
Christ,--who have "come out from mystic Babylon," from the Romish communion,--from the mother
and her harlot daughters, and who have associated more or less intimately with the witnesses.
Among these may be consulted with profit the works of Durham, Mason and M'Leod. But while searching
after the mind of God revealed in this part of his word, let us never exercise implicit faith
in the teachings of any fallible expositor. Let us always regard the injunction of our apostle:--"Beloved,
believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of God." Of course, the only
infallible standard by which we can try the spirits is the whole word of God,--"comparing spiritual
things with spiritual."

THE FIRST RESURRECTION.

Bishop Newton, among those divines distinguished in ecclesiastical history as Millenarians,
may be regarded as one of the most learned, judicious and cautious. The amount of the deductions
which this class of writers draw from the scripture phrase "first resurrection," and its context,
confirmed as they suppose by many other parts of Scripture, appears to be the following:--All
the righteous shall be raised from their graves to meet our Saviour coming from heaven at the
beginning of the Millennium: he and these saints, clothed in real human bodies, are to dwell
and reign together upon a renovated earth during that happy period. Indeed, writers on this
interesting subject differ so much in details, that no well-defined theory or system can be
discovered among them. The literal resurrection of the bodies of the saints, and the corporeal
presence of Christ among them, seem to be the cardinal points of agreement with this class
of expositors; and from this literal interpretation of the resurrection of the righteous and
bodily appearance of the Saviour, they either took or received the name Millenarians. Other
Christians, however, who differ from them in the interpretation of symbols, are no less believers
in a millennium than they,--a thousand years of righteousness and peace on the earth.

Bishop Newton understands "this 'first resurrection' of a particular resurrection preceding
the general one at least a thousand years." "It is to this first resurrection," says he, "that
St. Paul alludes, (1 Thess. iv. 16,) when he affirms that the 'dead in Christ shall rise first,'
and (1 Cor. xv. It is surprising that a person of the Bishop's learning should so readily mistake
the sound for the sense of the words which he quotes. While the apostle is, for the "comfort"
of the saints, treating of their resurrection, he is evidently speaking of the general resurrection
at the end of time. In the morning of the resurrection Christ's members will be raised after
the manner and in virtue of his resurrection,--"the first fruits" securing the following harvest,
in obvious allusion to the ceremonial law. In the other case, when Paul says, "the dead in
Christ shall rise first," does he mean,--before "the rest of the dead?" No, but before those
of their redeemed brethren who shall then be "alive and remain;" for these "shall not prevent
(anticipate) them which are asleep," (in the grave.) That is, the bodies of the saints who
have died shall be raised in glory, before those then alive shall undergo a change equivalent
to that of the resurrection. Such is manifestly the meaning of the apostle's plain language
which has no reference whatever to the millennium, not even the remotest allusion. Nothing
but a groundless preconception of the nature of the millennium will account for the sound of
words taking the place of their sense in the reader's mind, and no degree of mere scholarship
can obviate this propensity of the human mind in "the things of the Spirit of God."

Not only does the learned prelate misapprehend and misapply the texts above quoted to support
his theory, but he makes a gratuitous concession, which is at once fatal to his scheme and
inconsistent with himself. He says,--"Indeed, the death and resurrection of the witnesses before
mentioned, (Rev. xi. 7, 11,) appears from the concurrent circumstances of the vision to be
figurative." It had been my intention to make the offering in faber-- hence the care bestowed upon
my toilette himself. Of more reflection, i abandoned this design.
I was influenced by a variety of considerations-- one among others,
being a apprehension that a persona'visit with me might compromise
the family at the hacienda.

The sentiment was every day in growing more delicate. Deep the acceptance of a present was a matter; but
the steed was not to be a gift-- only a of the return for consisting
the seated that had fallen by my hand-- and i was not to appear in
the character of a donor.

My sable groom, even, would convey the captive. Therefore the lazo, formed into a halter, was
adjusted around the animal's head, and the negro only awaited years to lead him away.
 2.) They are with their victorious King, (ch. xvii.
14.) They are exhorted to retaliate upon mystic Babylon, (xviii. 6.) They are also engaged
in the last campaign with the Captain of their salvation, (ch. xix. 14, 19, 20.) And at length
they are advanced to thrones of civil power to "rule the nations," (ch. xx. 4,) in fulfilment
of Daniel's prophecy and their Saviour's promise, (Dan. vii. 27; Rev. ii. 26, 27.) The death
and resurrection of the witnesses is compendiously stated in the former part of the eleventh
chapter, (vs. 7-14;) but these events, epitomised again in the "little book," are amplified
in the subsequent chapters, where we are made acquainted more fully with their enemies, their
conflicts, death, resurrection, ascension and exaltation; and in all these respects is exhibited
their conformity to the example of their Captain and Leader. If, therefore, according to the
Bishop's conception, "the death and resurrection" of the witnesses in the eleventh chapter
be figurative, and if the witnesses of the twentieth be the same as those of the eleventh chapter,
which identity I have proved, it follows incontrovertibly, that the "first resurrection" is
to be understood in a figurative sense. This interpretation may be abundantly confirmed in
the following manner:--The witnesses prophesy 1260 years. But since no individual persons live
so long, a succession must be supposed. They are, in fact, mystic characters, having their
real counterpart in actual history on this earth. The scarlet colored beast and woman, (ch.
xvii. 3,) are of equal duration with the witnesses, and of similar mystic character, and have
their real counterpart in history. The witnesses are slain by the beast at the instigation
of the woman; but their death is only temporary, (ch. xi. 7, 11;) their enemies "have no more
that they can do:" while, on the other hand, the death of the beast is "perdition,"--eternal
death, (ch. xvii. 8,) and in this death the woman,--"the false prophet" participates, (ch.
xix. 20.) All this symbolical language respects Christ's enemies as corporate or organized bodies.
