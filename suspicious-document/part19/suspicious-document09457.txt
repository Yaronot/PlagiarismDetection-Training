Potter laughed. "Talbot Potter leaves the stage because a little 'ingenue' understudy tries
to break the rules of his company! Likely, isn't it?"

"Looks so," said old Tinker.

"Does it?" retorted Potter with rising fury. "Then I'll tell you, since you seem not to know
it, that I'm not going to leave the stage! Can't a man give vent to his feelings once in his
life without being caught up and held to it by every old school-teacher that's stumbled into
