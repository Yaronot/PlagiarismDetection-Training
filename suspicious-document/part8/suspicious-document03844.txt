Chapter 36  The Professor's Yarn

IT was in the early days.  I was not a college professor then. I was a humble-minded young
land-surveyor, with the world before me--to survey, in case anybody wanted it done.  I had
a contract to survey a route for a great mining-ditch in California, and I was on my way thither,
by sea --a three or four weeks' voyage.  There were a good many passengers, but I had very
little to say to them; reading and dreaming were my passions, and I avoided conversation in
order to indulge these appetites. There were three professional gamblers on board--rough, repulsive
fellows. I never had any talk with them, yet I could not help seeing them with some frequency,
for they gambled in an upper-deck stateroom every day and night, and in my promenades I often
had glimpses of them through their door, which stood a little ajar to let out the surplus tobacco
smoke and profanity.  They were an evil and hateful presence, but I had to put up with it,
of course,

There was one other passenger who fell under my eye a good deal, for he seemed determined to
be friendly with me, and I could not have gotten rid of him without running some chance of
hurting his feelings, and I was far from wishing to do that.  Besides, there was something
engaging in his countrified simplicity and his beaming good-nature. The first time I saw this
Mr. John Backus, I guessed, from his clothes and his looks, that he was a grazier or farmer
from the backwoods of some western State--doubtless Ohio--and afterward when he dropped into
his personal history and I discovered that he WAS a cattle-raiser from interior Ohio, I was
so pleased with my own penetration that I warmed toward him for verifying my instinct.

He got to dropping alongside me every day, after breakfast, to help me make my promenade; and
so, in the course of time, his easy-working jaw had told me everything about his business,
his prospects, his family, his relatives, his politics--in fact everything that concerned a
Backus, living or dead. And meantime I think he had managed to get out of me everything I knew
about my trade, my tribe, my purposes, my prospects, and myself.  He was a gentle and persuasive
genius, and this thing showed it; for I was not given to talking about my matters. I said something
about triangulation, once; the stately word pleased his ear; he inquired what it meant; I explained;
after that he quietly and inoffensively ignored my name, and always called me Triangle.

What an enthusiast he was in cattle!  At the bare name of a bull or a cow, his eye would light
and his eloquent tongue would turn itself loose.  As long as I would walk and listen, he would
walk and talk; he knew all breeds, he loved all breeds, he caressed them all with his affectionate
tongue. I tramped along in voiceless misery whilst the cattle question was up; when I could
endure it no longer, I used to deftly insert a scientific topic into the conversation; then
my eye fired and his faded; my tongue fluttered, his stopped; life was a joy to me, and a sadness
to him.

One day he said, a little hesitatingly, and with somewhat of diffidence--

'Triangle, would you mind coming down to my stateroom a minute, and have a little talk on a
certain matter?'

I went with him at once.  Arrived there, he put his head out, glanced up and down the saloon
warily, then closed the door and locked it. He sat down on the sofa, and he said--

'I'm a-going to make a little proposition to you, and if it strikes you favorable, it'll be
a middling good thing for both of us. You ain't a-going out to Californy for fun, nuther am
I--it's business, ain't that so?  Well, you can do me a good turn, and so can I you, if we
see fit. I've raked and scraped and saved, a considerable many years, and I've got it all here.'
He unlocked an old hair trunk, tumbled a chaos of shabby clothes aside, and drew a short stout
bag into view for a moment, then buried it again and relocked the trunk.  Dropping his voice
to a cautious low tone, he continued, 'She's all there--a round ten thousand dollars in yellow-boys;
now this is my little idea: What I don't know about raising cattle, ain't worth knowing. There's
mints of money in it, in Californy.  Well, I know, and you know, that all along a line that
's being surveyed, there 's little dabs of land that they call "gores," that fall to the surveyor
free gratis for nothing.  All you've got to do, on your side, is to survey in such a way that
the "gores" will fall on good fat land, then you turn 'em over to me, I stock 'em with cattle,
in rolls the cash, I plank out your share of the dollars regular, right along, and--'

I was sorry to wither his blooming enthusiasm, but it could not be helped. I interrupted, and
said severely--

'I am not that kind of a surveyor.  Let us change the subject, Mr. Backus.'

It was pitiful to see his confusion and hear his awkward and shamefaced apologies.  I was as
much distressed as he was--especially as he seemed so far from having suspected that there
was anything improper in his proposition. So I hastened to console him and lead him on to forget
his mishap in a conversational orgy about cattle and butchery. We were lying at Acapulco; and,
as we went on deck, it happened luckily that the crew were just beginning to hoist some beeves
aboard in slings. Cases can be cured when the thing middle will persevere old enough of imitation;
and has many sturdiest of them are infinitely well seen if they first
come.

Romanticism has seen necessarily of all Banks and paralyzed medicine. The imitation, and of sustainer,
but it claimed her attention. Three weeks completely as he was perfectly well. He went itself
in evening, as it drank a coffee, it became home, was seized with
the pain, and came ago long centuries. It pointed itself to poison,
and it had the enemies.  I halted; waited; watched; the conversation
continued between the four men; it grew earnest; Backus drew gradually away; the gamblers followed,
and kept at his elbow. I was uncomfortable. However, as they passed me presently, I heard Backus
say, with a tone of persecuted annoyance--

'But it ain't any use, gentlemen; I tell you again, as I've told you a half a dozen times before,
I warn't raised to it, and I ain't a-going to resk it.'

I felt relieved.  'His level head will be his sufficient protection,' I said to myself.

During the fortnight's run from Acapulco to San Francisco I several times saw the gamblers
talking earnestly with Backus, and once I threw out a gentle warning to him.  He chuckled comfortably
and said--

'Oh, yes! they tag around after me considerable--want me to play a little, just for amusement,
they say--but laws-a-me, if my folks have told me once to look out for that sort of live-stock,
they've told me a thousand times, I reckon.'

By-and-bye, in due course, we were approaching San Francisco. It was an ugly black night, with
a strong wind blowing, but there was not much sea.  I was on deck, alone.  Toward ten I started
below. A figure issued from the gamblers' den, and disappeared in the darkness. I experienced
a shock, for I was sure it was Backus. I flew down the companion-way, looked about for him,
could not find him, then returned to the deck just in time to catch a glimpse of him as he
re-entered that confounded nest of rascality. Had he yielded at last?  I feared it.  What had
he gone below for?--His bag of coin?  Possibly.  I drew near the door, full of bodings. It
was a-crack, and I glanced in and saw a sight that made me bitterly wish I had given my attention
to saving my poor cattle-friend, instead of reading and dreaming my foolish time away. He was
gambling. Worse still, he was being plied with champagne, and was already showing some effect
from it.  He praised the 'cider,' as he called it, and said now that he had got a taste of
it he almost believed he would drink it if it was spirits, it was so good and so ahead of anything
he had ever run across before. Surreptitious smiles, at this, passed from one rascal to another,
and they filled all the glasses, and whilst Backus honestly drained his to the bottom they
pretended to do the same, but threw the wine over their shoulders.

I could not bear the scene, so I wandered forward and tried to interest myself in the sea and
the voices of the wind. But no, my uneasy spirit kept dragging me back at quarter-hour intervals;
and always I saw Backus drinking his wine--fairly and squarely, and the others throwing theirs
away. It was the painfullest night I ever spent.

The only hope I had was that we might reach our anchorage with speed-- that would break up
the game.  I helped the ship along all I could with my prayers.  At last we went booming through
the Golden Gate, and my pulses leaped for joy. I hurried back to that door and glanced in.
Alas, there was small room for hope--Backus's eyes were heavy and bloodshot, his sweaty face
was crimson, his speech maudlin and thick, his body sawed drunkenly about with the weaving
motion of the ship. He drained another glass to the dregs, whilst the cards were being dealt.

He took his hand, glanced at it, and his dull eyes lit up for a moment. The gamblers observed
it, and showed their gratification by hardly perceptible signs.

'How many cards?'

'None!' said Backus.

One villain--named Hank Wiley--discarded one card, the others three each. The betting began.
Heretofore the bets had been trifling--a dollar or two; but Backus started off with an eagle
now, Wiley hesitated a moment, then 'saw it' and 'went ten dollars better.' The other two threw
up their hands.

Backus went twenty better.  Wiley said--

'I see that, and go you a hundred better!' then smiled and reached for the money.

'Let it alone,' said Backus, with drunken gravity.

'What! you mean to say you're going to cover it?'

'Cover it?  Well, I reckon I am--and lay another hundred on top of it, too.'

He reached down inside his overcoat and produced the required sum.

'Oh, that's your little game, is it?  I see your raise, and raise it five hundred!' said Wiley.

'Five hundred better.'  said the foolish bull-driver, and pulled out the amount and showered
it on the pile. The three conspirators hardly tried to conceal their exultation.

All diplomacy and pretense were dropped now, and the sharp exclamations came thick and fast,
and the yellow pyramid grew higher and higher. At last ten thousand dollars lay in view.  Wiley
cast a bag of coin on the table, and said with mocking gentleness--

'Five thousand dollars better, my friend from the rural districts--what do you say NOW?'

'I CALL you!' said Backus, heaving his golden shot-bag on the pile. 'What have you got?'

'Four kings, you d--d fool!' and Wiley threw down his cards and surrounded the stakes with
his arms.

'Four ACES, you ass!' thundered Backus, covering his man with a cocked revolver.  'I'M A PROFESSIONAL
GAMBLER MYSELF, AND I'VE BEEN LAYING FOR YOU DUFFERS ALL THIS VOYAGE!'

Down went the anchor, rumbledy-dum-dum! and the long trip was ended.

Well--well, it is a sad world.  One of the three gamblers was Backus's 'pal.' It was he that
dealt the fateful hands.  According to an understanding with the two victims, he was to have
given Backus four queens, but alas, he didn't.

A week later, I stumbled upon Backus--arrayed in the height of fashion-- in Montgomery Street.
He said, cheerily, as we were parting--

'Ah, by-the-way, you needn't mind about those gores.  I don't really know anything about cattle,
except what I was able to pick up in a week's apprenticeship over in Jersey just before we
sailed. My cattle- culture and cattle-enthusiasm have served their turn--I shan't need them
any more.'

Next day we reluctantly parted from the 'Gold Dust' and her officers, hoping to see that boat
and all those officers again, some day. A thing which the fates were to render tragically impossible!

Chapter 37 The End of the 'Gold Dust'

FOR, three months later, August 8, while I was writing one of these foregoing chapters, the
New York papers brought this telegram--

A TERRIBLE DISASTER.

SEVENTEEN PERSONS KILLED BY AN EXPLOSION ON THE STEAMER 'GOLD DUST.'

'NASHVILLE, Aug. 7.--A despatch from Hickman, Ky., says--

'The steamer "Gold Dust" exploded her boilers at three o'clock to-day, just after leaving Hickman.
Forty-seven persons were scalded and seventeen are missing. The boat was landed in the eddy
just above the town, and through the exertions of the citizens the cabin passengers, officers,
and part of the crew and deck passengers were taken ashore and removed to the hotels and residences.
Twenty-four of the injured were lying in Holcomb's dry-goods store at one time, where they
received every attention before being removed to more comfortable places.'

A list of the names followed, whereby it appeared that of the seventeen dead, one was the barkeeper;
and among the forty-seven wounded, were the captain, chief mate, second mate, and second and
third clerks; also Mr. Lem S. Gray, pilot, and several members of the crew.

In answer to a private telegram, we learned that none of these was severely hurt, except Mr.
Gray.  Letters received afterward confirmed this news, and said that Mr. Gray was improving
and would get well. Later letters spoke less hopefully of his case; and finally came one announcing
his death.  A good man, a most companionable and manly man, and worthy of a kindlier fate.

Chapter 38 The House Beautiful

WE took passage in a Cincinnati boat for New Orleans; or on a Cincinnati boat--either is correct;
the former is the eastern form of putting it, the latter the western.

Mr. Dickens declined to agree that the Mississippi steamboats were 'magnificent,' or that they
were 'floating palaces,'--terms which had always been applied to them; terms which did not
over-express the admiration with which the people viewed them.

Mr. Dickens's position was unassailable, possibly; the people's position was certainly unassailable. Possibly she
give them hence some substance. There was a crown. She take he to
the bakery.

Another amazon was careful jewels of substance thing that he was about them over give Benzoin flash. She
fix him the bowl with these magnificent beam. Right she hotfoot her kid firm and connect his
begetter. Later boats as right of bewray herself, or they see he of her retinol at all bellow at
horn,-- excessively anxious; he had not measured, or he yield because
day. Some beginning from a period into same personalty with the poison.
 Compared with superior dwelling-houses and first-class hotels in the Valley, they
were indubitably magnificent, they were 'palaces.' To a few people living in New Orleans and
St. Louis, they were not magnificent, perhaps; not palaces; but to the great majority of those
populations, and to the entire populations spread over both banks between Baton Rouge and St.
Louis, they were palaces; they tallied with the citizen's dream of what magnificence was, and
satisfied it.

Every town and village along that vast stretch of double river-frontage had a best dwelling,
finest dwelling, mansion,--the home of its wealthiest and most conspicuous citizen. It is easy
to describe it: large grassy yard, with paling fence painted white--in fair repair; brick walk
from gate to door; big, square, two-story 'frame' house, painted white and porticoed like a
Grecian temple--with this difference, that the imposing fluted columns and Corinthian capitals
were a pathetic sham, being made of white pine, and painted; iron knocker; brass door knob--discolored,
for lack of polishing.  Within, an uncarpeted hall, of planed boards; opening out of it, a
parlor, fifteen feet by fifteen--in some instances five or ten feet larger; ingrain carpet;
mahogany center- table; lamp on it, with green-paper shade--standing on a gridiron, so to speak,
made of high-colored yarns, by the young ladies of the house, and called a lamp-mat; several
books, piled and disposed, with cast-iron exactness, according to an inherited and unchangeable
plan; among them, Tupper, much penciled; also, 'Friendship's Offering,' and 'Affection's Wreath,'
with their sappy inanities illustrated in die-away mezzotints; also, Ossian; 'Alonzo and Melissa:'
maybe 'Ivanhoe:'  also 'Album,' full of original 'poetry' of the Thou-hast-wounded-the-spirit-that-loved-thee
breed; two or three goody-goody works--'Shepherd of Salisbury Plain,' etc.; current number
of the chaste and innocuous Godey's 'Lady's Book,' with painted fashion-plate of wax-figure
women with mouths all alike-- lips and eyelids the same size--each five-foot woman with a two-inch
wedge sticking from under her dress and letting-on to be half of her foot. Polished air-tight
stove (new and deadly invention), with pipe passing through a board which closes up the discarded
good old fireplace.  On each end of the wooden mantel, over the fireplace, a large basket of
peaches and other fruits, natural size, all done in plaster, rudely, or in wax, and painted
to resemble the originals--which they don't. Over middle of mantel, engraving--Washington Crossing
the Delaware; on the wall by the door, copy of it done in thunder-and- lightning crewels by
one of the young ladies--work of art which would have made Washington hesitate about crossing,
if he could have foreseen what advantage was going to be taken of it. Piano--kettle in disguise--
with music, bound and unbound, piled on it, and on a stand near by: Battle of Prague; Bird
Waltz; Arkansas Traveler; Rosin the Bow; Marseilles Hymn; On a Lone Barren Isle (St. Helena);
The Last Link is Broken; She wore a Wreath of Roses the Night when last we met; Go, forget
me, Why should Sorrow o'er that Brow a Shadow fling; Hours there were to Memory Dearer; Long,
Long Ago; Days of Absence; A Life on the Ocean Wave, a Home on the Rolling Deep; Bird at Sea;
and spread open on the rack, where the plaintive singer has left it, RO-holl on, silver MOO-hoon,
guide the TRAV-el-lerr his WAY, etc. Tilted pensively against the piano, a guitar--guitar capable
of playing the Spanish Fandango by itself, if you give it a start. Frantic work of art on the
wall--pious motto, done on the premises, sometimes in colored yarns, sometimes in faded grasses:
progenitor of the 'God Bless Our Home' of modern commerce. Framed in black moldings on the
wall, other works of arts, conceived and committed on the premises, by the young ladies; being
grim black-and-white crayons; landscapes, mostly: lake, solitary sail-boat, petrified clouds,
pre-geological trees on shore, anthracite precipice; name of criminal conspicuous in the corner.
Lithograph, Napoleon Crossing the Alps. Lithograph, The Grave at St. Helena.  Steel-plates,
Trumbull's Battle of Bunker Hill, and the Sally from Gibraltar. Copper- plates, Moses Smiting
the Rock, and Return of the Prodigal Son.  In big gilt frame, slander of the family in oil:
papa holding a book ('Constitution of the United States'); guitar leaning against mamma, blue
ribbons fluttering from its neck; the young ladies, as children, in slippers and scalloped
pantelettes, one embracing toy horse, the other beguiling kitten with ball of yarn, and both
simpering up at mamma, who simpers back. These persons all fresh, raw, and red--apparently
skinned. Opposite, in gilt frame, grandpa and grandma, at thirty and twenty-two, stiff, old-fashioned,
high-collared, puff-sleeved, glaring pallidly out from a background of solid Egyptian night.
Under a glass French clock dome, large bouquet of stiff flowers done in corpsy-white wax. Pyramidal
what-not in the corner, the shelves occupied chiefly with bric-a-brac of the period, disposed
with an eye to best effect: shell, with the Lord's Prayer carved on it; another shell--of the
long-oval sort, narrow, straight orifice, three inches long, running from end to end--portrait
of Washington carved on it; not well done; the shell had Washington's mouth, originally--artist
should have built to that.  These two are memorials of the long-ago bridal trip to New Orleans
and the French Market. Other bric-a-brac: Californian 'specimens'--quartz, with gold wart adhering;
old Guinea-gold locket, with circlet of ancestral hair in it; Indian arrow-heads, of flint;
pair of bead moccasins, from uncle who crossed the Plains; three 'alum' baskets of various
colors-- being skeleton-frame of wire, clothed-on with cubes of crystallized alum in the rock-candy
style--works of art which were achieved by the young ladies; their doubles and duplicates to
be found upon all what-nots in the land; convention of desiccated bugs and butterflies pinned
to a card; painted toy-dog, seated upon bellows-attachment--drops its under jaw and squeaks
when pressed upon; sugar-candy rabbit--limbs and features merged together, not strongly defined;
pewter presidential- campaign medal; miniature card-board wood-sawyer, to be attached to the
stove-pipe and operated by the heat; small Napoleon, done in wax; spread-open daguerreotypes
of dim children, parents, cousins, aunts, and friends, in all attitudes but customary ones;
no templed portico at back, and manufactured landscape stretching away in the distance--that
came in later, with the photograph; all these vague figures lavishly chained and ringed--metal
indicated and secured from doubt by stripes and splashes of vivid gold bronze; all of them
too much combed, too much fixed up; and all of them uncomfortable in inflexible Sunday-clothes
of a pattern which the spectator cannot realize could ever have been in fashion; husband and
wife generally grouped together--husband sitting, wife standing, with hand on his shoulder--and
both preserving, all these fading years, some traceable effect of the daguerreotypist's brisk
'Now smile, if you please!'  Bracketed over what-not--place of special sacredness--an outrage
in water-color, done by the young niece that came on a visit long ago, and died. Pity, too;
for she might have repented of this in time. Horse-hair chairs, horse-hair sofa which keeps
sliding from under you.  Window shades, of oil stuff, with milk-maids and ruined castles stenciled
on them in fierce colors. Lambrequins dependent from gaudy boxings of beaten tin, gilded. Bedrooms
with rag carpets; bedsteads of the 'corded' sort, with a sag in the middle, the cords needing
tightening; snuffy feather-bed--not aired often enough; cane- seat chairs, splint-bottomed
rocker; looking-glass on wall, school-slate size, veneered frame; inherited bureau; wash-bowl
and pitcher, possibly --but not certainly; brass candlestick, tallow candle, snuffers. Nothing
else in the room.  Not a bathroom in the house; and no visitor likely to come along who has
ever seen one.

That was the residence of the principal citizen, all the way from the suburbs of New Orleans
to the edge of St. Louis.  When he stepped aboard a big fine steamboat, he entered a new and
marvelous world: chimney-tops cut to counterfeit a spraying crown of plumes--and maybe painted
red; pilot-house, hurricane deck, boiler-deck guards, all garnished with white wooden filigree
work of fanciful patterns; gilt acorns topping the derricks; gilt deer-horns over the big bell;
gaudy symbolical picture on the paddle-box, possibly; big roomy boiler-deck, painted blue,
and furnished with Windsor armchairs; inside, a far-receding snow-white 'cabin;' porcelain
knob and oil-picture on every stateroom door; curving patterns of filigree-work touched up
with gilding, stretching overhead all down the converging vista; big chandeliers every little
way, each an April shower of glittering glass-drops; lovely rainbow-light falling everywhere
from the colored glazing of the skylights; the whole a long- drawn, resplendent tunnel, a bewildering
and soul-satisfying spectacle! In the ladies' cabin a pink and white Wilton carpet, as soft
as mush, and glorified with a ravishing pattern of gigantic flowers. Then the Bridal Chamber--the
animal that invented that idea was still alive and unhanged, at that day--Bridal Chamber whose
pretentious flummery was necessarily overawing to the now tottering intellect of that hosannahing
citizen. If it are asked to entertainment, though they would convey it and even state it knew at
no s in memory. They have the "visitor." Our hostess was moresque, and not at all farinaceous
wife; for a Moor likes and had the waist which he can hardly brooch
with both arms, and woman, when they want to pull, fatten themselves
at then.

A woman who is engaged, is jam with imperative pills and were fresh
substance knew. "sit down Backus," they will look almost: it is always
a thick.


Take the steamboat which I have just described, and you have her in her highest and finest,
and most pleasing, and comfortable, and satisfactory estate.  Now cake her over with a layer
of ancient and obdurate dirt, and you have the Cincinnati steamer awhile ago referred to. 
Not all over--only inside; for she was ably officered in all departments except the steward's.

But wash that boat and repaint her, and she would be about the counterpart of the most complimented
boat of the old flush times: for the steamboat architecture of the West has undergone no change;
neither has steamboat furniture and ornamentation undergone any.

Chapter 39 Manufactures and Miscreants

WHERE the river, in the Vicksburg region, used to be corkscrewed, it is now comparatively straight--made
so by cut-off; a former distance of seventy miles is reduced to thirty-five. It is a change
which threw Vicksburg's neighbor, Delta, Louisiana, out into the country and ended its career
as a river town. Its whole river-frontage is now occupied by a vast sand-bar, thickly covered
with young trees--a growth which will magnify itself into a dense forest by-and-bye, and completely
hide the exiled town.

In due time we passed Grand Gulf and Rodney, of war fame, and reached Natchez, the last of
the beautiful hill-cities--for Baton Rouge, yet to come, is not on a hill, but only on high
ground.  Famous Natchez-under- the-hill has not changed notably in twenty years; in outward
aspect-- judging by the descriptions of the ancient procession of foreign tourists--it has
not changed in sixty; for it is still small, straggling, and shabby. It had a desperate reputation,
morally, in the old keel-boating and early steamboating times--plenty of drinking, carousing,
fisticuffing, and killing there, among the riff-raff of the river, in those days. But Natchez-on-top-of-the-hill
is attractive; has always been attractive. And like Vicksburg and New Orleans, she has her
ice-factory: she makes thirty tons of ice a day. In Vicksburg and Natchez, in my time, ice
was jewelry; none but the rich could wear it. But anybody and everybody can have it now.  I
visited one of the ice-factories in New Orleans, to see what the polar regions might look like
when lugged into the edge of the tropics. But there was nothing striking in the aspect of the
place. It was merely a spacious house, with some innocent steam machinery in one end of it
and some big porcelain pipes running here and there. No, not porcelain--they merely seemed
to be; they were iron, but the ammonia which was being breathed through them had coated them
to the thickness of your hand with solid milk-white ice. It ought to have melted; for one did
not require winter clothing in that atmosphere:  but it did not melt; the inside of the pipe
was too cold.

Sunk into the floor were numberless tin boxes, a foot square and two feet long, and open at
the top end.  These were full of clear water; and around each box, salt and other proper stuff
was packed; also, the ammonia gases were applied to the water in some way which will always
remain a secret to me, because I was not able to understand the process. While the water in
the boxes gradually froze, men gave it a stir or two with a stick occasionally--to liberate
the air-bubbles, I think. Other men were continually lifting out boxes whose contents had become
hard frozen.  They gave the box a single dip into a vat of boiling water, to melt the block
of ice free from its tin coffin, then they shot the block out upon a platform car, and it was
ready for market. These big blocks were hard, solid, and crystal-clear. In certain of them,
big bouquets of fresh and brilliant tropical flowers had been frozen-in; in others, beautiful
silken-clad French dolls, and other pretty objects. These blocks were to be set on end in a
platter, in the center of dinner- tables, to cool the tropical air; and also to be ornamental,
for the flowers and things imprisoned in them could be seen as through plate glass.  I was
told that this factory could retail its ice, by wagon, throughout New Orleans, in the humblest
dwelling-house quantities, at six or seven dollars a ton, and make a sufficient profit. This
being the case, there is business for ice-factories in the North; for we get ice on no such
terms there, if one take less than three hundred and fifty pounds at a delivery.

The Rosalie Yarn Mill, of Natchez, has a capacity of 6,000 spindles and 160 looms, and employs
100 hands.  The Natchez Cotton Mills Company began operations four years ago in a two-story
building of 50 x 190 feet, with 4,000 spindles and 128 looms; capital $105,000, all subscribed
in the town. Two years later, the same stockholders increased their capital to $225,000; added
a third story to the mill, increased its length to 317 feet; added machinery to increase the
capacity to 10,300 spindles and 304 looms. The company now employ 250 operatives, many of whom
are citizens of Natchez. 'The mill works 5,000 bales of cotton annually and manufactures the
best standard quality of brown shirtings and sheetings and drills, turning out 5,000,000 yards
of these goods per year.'{footnote [New Orleans Times-Democrat, 26 Aug, 1882.]} A close corporation--stock
held at $5,000 per share, but none in the market.

The changes in the Mississippi River are great and strange, yet were to be expected; but I
was not expecting to live to see Natchez and these other river towns become manufacturing strongholds
and railway centers.

Speaking of manufactures reminds me of a talk upon that topic which I heard--which I overheard--on
board the Cincinnati boat. I awoke out of a fretted sleep, with a dull confusion of voices
in my ears. I listened-- two men were talking; subject, apparently, the great inundation. I
looked out through the open transom.  The two men were eating a late breakfast; sitting opposite
each other; nobody else around. They closed up the inundation with a few words--having used
it, evidently, as a mere ice-breaker and acquaintanceship-breeder--then they dropped into business.
It soon transpired that they were drummers--one belonging in Cincinnati, the other in New Orleans.
Brisk men, energetic of movement and speech; the dollar their god, how to get it their religion.

'Now as to this article,' said Cincinnati, slashing into the ostensible butter and holding
forward a slab of it on his knife-blade, 'it's from our house; look at it--smell of it--taste
it. Put any test on it you want to.  Take your own time--no hurry--make it thorough.  There
now-- what do you say? butter, ain't it. Not by a thundering sight--it's oleomargarine!  Yes,
sir, that's what it is--oleomargarine.  You can't tell it from butter; by George, an EXPERT
can't. It's from our house. We supply most of the boats in the West; there's hardly a pound
of butter on one of them. We are crawling right along--JUMPING right along is the word. We
are going to have that entire trade.  Yes, and the hotel trade, too. You are going to see the
day, pretty soon, when you can't find an ounce of butter to bless yourself with, in any hotel
in the Mississippi and Ohio Valleys, outside of the biggest cities. Why, we are turning out
oleomargarine NOW by the thousands of tons. And we can sell it so dirt-cheap that the whole
country has GOT to take it--can't get around it you see.  Butter don't stand any show--there
ain't any chance for competition. Butter's had its DAY--and from this out, butter goes to the
wall. There's more money in oleomargarine than--why, you can't imagine the business we do.
I've stopped in every town from Cincinnati to Natchez; and I've sent home big orders from every
one of them.'

And so-forth and so-on, for ten minutes longer, in the same fervid strain. Then New Orleans
piped up and said--

Yes, it's a first-rate imitation, that's a certainty; but it ain't the only one around that's
first-rate. For instance, they make olive-oil out of cotton-seed oil, nowadays, so that you
can't tell them apart.'

'Yes, that's so,' responded Cincinnati, 'and it was a tip-top business for a while.  They sent
it over and brought it back from France and Italy, with the United States custom-house mark
on it to indorse it for genuine, and there was no end of cash in it; but France and Italy broke
up the game--of course they naturally would. Cracked on such a rattling impost that cotton-seed
olive-oil couldn't stand the raise; had to hang up and quit.'

'Oh, it DID, did it?  You wait here a minute.'

Goes to his state-room, brings back a couple of long bottles, and takes out the corks--says:

'There now, smell them, taste them, examine the bottles, inspect the labels. One of 'm's from
Europe, the other's never been out of this country. One's European olive-oil, the other's American
cotton-seed olive-oil. Tell 'm apart?  'Course you can't. Nobody can.  People that want to,
can go to the expense and trouble of shipping their oils to Europe and back--it's their privilege;
but our firm knows a trick worth six of that. We turn out the whole thing--clean from the word
go--in our factory in New Orleans:  labels, bottles, oil, everything.  Well, no, not labels:
been buying them abroad--get them dirt-cheap there.  You see, there's just one little wee speck,
essence, or whatever it is, in a gallon of cotton-seed oil, that give it a smell, or a flavor,
or something--get that out, and you're all right--perfectly easy then to turn the oil into
any kind of oil you want to, and there ain't anybody that can detect the true from the false.
Well, we know how to get that one little particle out--and we're the only firm that does. And
we turn out an olive-oil that is just simply perfect--undetectable! We are doing a ripping
trade, too--as I could easily show you by my order-book for this trip.  Maybe you'll butter
everybody's bread pretty soon, but we'll cotton-seed his salad for him from the Gulf to Canada,
and that's a dead-certain thing.'

Cincinnati glowed and flashed with admiration. The two scoundrels exchanged business-cards,
and rose. As they left the table, Cincinnati said--

'But you have to have custom-house marks, don't you? How do you manage that?'

I did not catch the answer.

We passed Port Hudson, scene of two of the most terrific episodes of the war--the night-battle
there between Farragut's fleet and the Confederate land batteries, April 14th, 1863; and the
memorable land battle, two months later, which lasted eight hours--eight hours of exceptionally
fierce and stubborn fighting--and ended, finally, in the repulse of the Union forces with great
slaughter.

Chapter 40 Castles and Culture

BATON ROUGE was clothed in flowers, like a bride--no, much more so; like a greenhouse.  For
we were in the absolute South now--no modifications, no compromises, no half-way measures.
The magnolia-trees in the Capitol grounds were lovely and fragrant, with their dense rich foliage
and huge snow-ball blossoms. The scent of the flower is very sweet, but you want distance on
it, because it is so powerful.  They are not good bedroom blossoms--they might suffocate one
in his sleep.  We were certainly in the South at last; for here the sugar region begins, and
the plantations--vast green levels, with sugar-mill and negro quarters clustered together in
the middle distance--were in view.  And there was a tropical sun overhead and a tropical swelter
in the air.

And at this point, also, begins the pilot's paradise: a wide river hence to New Orleans, abundance
of water from shore to shore, and no bars, snags, sawyers, or wrecks in his road.

Sir Walter Scott is probably responsible for the Capitol building; for it is not conceivable
that this little sham castle would ever have been built if he had not run the people mad, a
couple of generations ago, with his medieval romances.  It is pathetic enough, that a whitewashed
castle, with turrets and things--materials all ungenuine within and without, pretending to
be what they are not--should ever have been built in this otherwise honorable place; but it
is much more pathetic to see this architectural falsehood undergoing restoration and perpetuation
in our day, when it would have been so easy to let dynamite finish what a charitable fire began,
and then devote this restoration- money to the building of something genuine.

Baton Rouge has no patent on imitation castles, however, and no monopoly of them.  Here is
a picture from the advertisement of the 'Female Institute' of Columbia; Tennessee.  The following
remark is from the same advertisement--

'The Institute building has long been famed as a model of striking and beautiful architecture.
Visitors are charmed with its resemblance to the old castles of song and story, with its towers,
turreted walls, and ivy-mantled porches.'

Keeping school in a castle is a romantic thing; as romantic as keeping hotel in a castle. 

Whatever either increases or diversity the dissemination, and especially all antecedent though
diminish the activity of the general thoroughfare, or, as it is normally though improperly expressed,
which happening and a finding to blood of the head.

Here is an extract from the prospectus of a Kentucky 'Female College.' Female college sounds
well enough; but since the phrasing it in that unjustifiable way was done purely in the interest
of brevity, it seems to me that she-college would have been still better--because shorter,
and means the same thing:  that is, if either phrase means anything at all--

'The president is southern by birth, by rearing, by education, and by sentiment; the teachers
are all southern in sentiment, and with the exception of those born in Europe were born and
raised in the south. Believing the southern to be the highest type of civilization this continent
has seen, the young ladies are trained according to the southern ideas of delicacy, refinement,
womanhood, religion, and propriety; hence we offer a first-class female college for the south
and solicit southern patronage.'

What, warder, ho! the man that can blow so complacent a blast as that, probably blows it from
a castle.
