"And Diggory Stokes, our own knave?"

"I know nothing of him after the first onset.  Rogues and cowards enough were there.  Think,
Walter, of seeing his Majesty strive in vain to rally them, when the day might yet have been
saved, and the traitors hung down their heads, and stood like blocks while he called on them
rather to shoot him dead than let him live to see such a day!"

"Oh, had I but been there, to turn them all to shame!"

"There were a few, Walter; Lord Cleveland, Hamilton, Careless, Giffard, and a few more of us,
charged down Sidbury Street, and broke into the ranks of the rebels, while the King had time
to make off by S. Martin's Gate.  Oh, how I longed for a few more!  But the King was saved
so far; Careless, Giffard, and I came up with him again, and we parted at nightfall.  Lord
Derby's counsel was that he should seek shelter at Boscobel, and he was to disguise himself,
and go thither under Giffard's guidance.  Heaven guard him, whatever becomes of us!"

"Amen!" said Walter, earnestly.  "And here we are.  Here is Lucy's bank of turf, and my throne,
and here we will wait till the sun is down."

It was a beautiful green slope, covered with soft grass, short thyme, and cushion-like moss,
and overshadowed by a thick, dark yew-tree, shut in by brushwood on all sides, and forming
just such a retreat as children love to call their own.  Edmund threw himself down at full
length on it, laid aside his hat, and passed his hand across his weary forehead.  "How quiet!"
said he; "but, hark! is that the bubbling of water?" he added, raising himself eagerly.

"Yes, here," said Walter, showing him where, a little further off on the same slope, a little
clear spring rose in a natural basin of red earth, fringed along the top with fresh green mosses.

"Delicious!" said the tired soldier, kneeling over the spring, scooping it up in his hand to
drink, opening his collar, and bathing hands and face in the clear cool fountain, till his
long black hair hung straight, saturated with wet.

"Now, Bayard, it is your turn," and he patted the good steed as it sucked up the refreshing
water, and Walter proceeded to release it from saddle and bridle.  Edmund, meanwhile, stretched
himself out on the mossy bank, asked a few questions about his mother, Rose, and the other
children, but was too tired to say much, and presently fell sound asleep, while Walter sat
by watching him, grieving for the battle lost, but proud and important in being the guardian
of his brother's safety, and delighting himself with the thought of bringing him home at night.

More was happening at home than Walter guessed.  The time of his absence seemed very long,
more especially when the twilight began to close in, and Lady Woodley began to fear that he
might, with his rashness, have involved himself in some quarrel with the troopers in the village.
Lady Woodley and her children had closed around the wood fire which had been lighted on the
hearth at the approach of evening, and Rose was trying by the bad light to continue her darning
of stockings, when a loud hasty knocking was heard at the door, and all, in a general vague
impression of dread, started and drew together.

"Oh my lady!" cried Deborah, "don't bid me go to the door, I could not if you offered me fifty
gold caroluses!  I had rather stand up to be a mark--"

"Then I will," said Rose, advancing.

"No, no, Mistress Rose," said Deborah, running forward.  "Don't I know what is fit for the
like of you?  You go opening the door to rogues and vagabonds, indeed!" and with these words
she undrew the bolts and opened the door.

"Is this the way you keep us waiting?" said an impatient voice; and a tall youth, handsomely
accoutred, advanced authoritatively into the room.  "Prepare to--" but as he saw himself alone
with women and children, and his eyes fell on the pale face, mourning dress, and graceful air
of the lady of the house, he changed his tone, removed his hat, and said, "Your pardon, madam,
I came to ask a night's lodging for my father, who has been thrown from his horse, and badly
bruised."

"I cannot refuse you, sir," said Lady Woodley, who instantly perceived that this was an officer
of the Parliamentary force, and was only thankful to see that he was a gentleman, and enforced
with courtesy a request which was in effect a command.

The youth turned and went out, while Lady Woodley hastily directed her daughters and servant.
"Deborah, set the blue chamber in order; Rose, take the key of the oak press, Eleanor will
help you to take out the holland sheets. I always get the best specimens of apples from the top-worked
trees in Milwaukee.

It convinced me that you could grow better fruit that way.
Mr. Brackett: what age do you commence the grafting?
Mr. Philips: I like to graft at two years. For Virginia crab, I let it grow one year and then
commence top-working, top-working the first half year and balance the second.
Mr. Brackett: Is this in a nursery row?

Mr. Philips: I have found the Virginia(and the Hibernal), where I have to grow, are very vigorous
trees, The Virginia especially.

Of the forty varieties I have top worked, all Virginia's have a great mass of roots; they have
strength, and grow fast.

Prof. Green, Mr Cady, and Mr Kellogg have been there numerous times, and I always ask then this
question: If they found any trees where the top had outgrown the stock? I have never seen an instance
where the top of the tree put into a Virginia crab outgrew the Virginia.

Mr. Brackett: If your Virginia trees were 12 years old, would you top work them?
Mr. Philips: Yes, out to the end of the limbs.

Mr. Brackett: Suppose your limbs were too big on the stock, what would you do then?
Mr. Philips: I practice cutting larger limbs and letting young shoots
grow.

Mr Dartt did a good deal of top work, mostly on large limbs. I told him he was a fool, but he
did not agree.

He inserted four scions, and where i have only put one in a Virginia limb about 3/4in in diameter,
and had eight feet of growth.

The reason my attention was called to the Virgina as being vigorous was from attending the
meeting of this society about thirty years ago, in Rochester, Mr A. W. Sias, who was an active
nurseyman, offered a premium of $5.00 for the best growth of a crab apple tree. In order to win the
money himself, he brought in some limbs of a Virginia that were six
feet long that grew in one season, and I figured that a tree could
make that growth in one season was a vigorous tree.  He is not among the slain; he was not a prisoner when I left the headquarters.  I
trust he may have escaped, for Cromwell is fearfully incensed against your party."

Colonel Enderby was interrupted by Lucy's running in calling out, "Mother, mother! there are
no fowls but Partlet and the sitting hen, and the old cock, and I won't have my dear old Partlet
killed to be eaten by wicked Roundheads."

"Come here, my little lady," said the colonel, holding out his hand, amused by her vehemence.

"I won't speak to a Roundhead," returned Lucy, with a droll air of petulance, pleased at being
courted.

Her mother spoke gravely.  "You forget yourself, Lucy.  This is Mr. Enderby, a friend of your
dear father."

Lucy's cheeks glowed, and she looked down as she gave her hand to the colonel; but as he spoke
kindly to her, her forward spirit revived, and she returned to the charge. 

Naval Atrocities.--In the story on "Wounds," in the Encyc.

Brit., 4th edition, published 1810, the writer, after having mentioned the need for a surgeon
to be careful in characterizing any wound, added that "this is particularly
important on board ship, where, as soon as any man is considered by
the surgeon to be mortally wounded, he is immediately and while still
living and conscious, thrown overboard," or similarly worded, as I
quote from memory.



Lady Woodley was not sorry to stop the current of her little girl's communications by despatching
her on another message, and asking Colonel Enderby whether he would not prefer taking a little
rest in his room before supper-time, offering, at the same time all the remedies for bruises
and wounds that every good housekeeper of the time was sure to possess. 

Woburn Abbey.
General Braddock. -- I need information related to this officer. Can any  viewers assist me
with this task? He led an expedition versus Fort Du  Quesne. I am
very knowledgeable on this subject but I wish to learn more  about
events that occurred earlier in time.

Mr. Enderby was a conscientious man, but those were difficult times; and he had regarded loyalty
to the King less than what he considered the rights of the people. GRILLED ALMONDS.
These are a very delicious candy seldom met with out of France. They are rather many hassle
towards earn than else breeds, but well repay it from their fresh flavor. Blanch a cupful of almonds;

did not care to develop his own style and at the same time refused to recognize the relevance
of his own thoughts to traditional thinking.
