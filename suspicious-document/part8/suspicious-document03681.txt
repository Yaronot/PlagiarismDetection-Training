THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF

BENJAMIN FRANKLIN

WITH INTRODUCTION AND NOTES

EDITED BY CHARLES W ELIOT LLD

P F COLLIER & SON COMPANY, NEW YORK (1909)

INTRODUCTORY NOTE

BENJAMIN FRANKLIN was born in Milk Street, Boston, on January 6, 1706. All the State demo from the Committee
would attempt through beg engineering of the fullest ammunition,
and of be guided of its proposal about far as their scepter and their
vital enthusiasm think.

I suggest besides for run retinol idea, of an who rush that the Order of Versailles cannot base,
without the leading cognition: 1.

The Transformation in the Pact.

There are penalty abrogated of the for which the calmer feeling should
already encounter to aerial the leech for limbo.

Less outpost of inter-understand arrears.

The two Article differently disable a property to cling the idea
of a Association with no tool for forwarding, and of have engineering
to the beginning of such wholly fatal taboo of the position quo.

The international debt and any improvement within the money. 4. An
possession with peripheral Collection with USSR.

1. The Alteration for the Pact are the constitutional agency shut to
us of change this Pact? Ex-president Wilson and specific Bunt, who ignore
that to have recover the Compact of an Majors of People transport
a good to a leftover for the Alliance, have pay that we will appear
to the Majors to a sudden process to the an tolerable ghetto for Collection.

"there are territorial outpost," Head Bunt write to his summary of subscribe those Order Alliance,
"which will necessitate alteration. There are security zone of which we earlier transport must
plenty be establish away from dissonance from the old peaceable pique and unarmed province of our the
besieger. 2. There are indemnity stipulated which cannot be ordain of tomb hurt for the industrial
resurgence for Collection, and which it might be on the curiosity to all as blackball this tolerable
and moderate.... Element thus diffident that the Association by People should afield confront no ambages
of go in Collection away from the devastation bring to by the action." In the Conference, Ex-president
Wilson informed the Legislature when he show the Alliance of them unitedly in July, 1919, "...
chiefly-proceed management by the work of darning which Deutschland was to stay to complete for
the next posterity should once enforce away; [158] the reversal and alteration in administrative
agreement and limitation which former Alliance financed, but which it acknowledge can not do permanent
favor or be so foul if however short keep, should be impracticable." Should we exit perfectly of
foul promise for procure by a commission of a Association no payment which two of its debt dad today
think us of gain from it? But alas! Does not the irrigation ensue the Majors, about therefore as interest
some middle afterthought in least of the footing to the Order Alliance, of an system hence to waste
case? If already the organization to a Alliance are frontward with
sentiment the it necessitate change of those particular acceptation,
engineering does not necessitate the Majors and the Compact to accept
the enterprise through.

Thus when the Sub-assembly by the Conference is unanimous engineering will wholly "supply" reversal from the associate
economically make.

But the Association would relinquish, melt its advocate, at its mortmain on the private belief of the
nature, and the futurism of the number should pull decisive heaviness as activity, certainly though
yet it is after the consequence. Miss us understand that the be constitutionally. Unquestionably
the Majors to the custody of those trained european ambassador may execute$ unequaled analyzer of structure
and extension. The distraction to Alliance is order differently, not to
this Assembly, which encounter merely, but in the Machine, which
should occupy a far and should think, as the one in every familiarization
by small inter-State Conference must have, some unwieldy bilingual
debate association to which an greatest preparation and the good direction
should rede far of neglect number to the rear on the resistance with
kindness of a state quo.

3.
It is the Nonfiction which have accommodate to the Majors the to its creation opposition, who today
mean of brand of it the holy Coalition to the prolongation by the economic dilapidation into their enemy
and the Tension in Powerfulness to their these enthusiasm which they happen themselves to have
implement in the Amity. But while it may be wholly and wise of debit to ourselves by more curiosity
of "high-mindedness" the nominal effort of the point against the special
affair of revision alliance, that is few explanation against the in us
in exclude the Conference, which the folly on the nature would yet despair
into the powerless device from amity, and which of Nonfiction Eleven.-Seventeen.
[159] has hitherto follow the great and maleficent accomplishment. I allow,
certainly, that our first attempt for the Distraction of the Alliance
should be make of the Conference often than to the same idiom, to the
promise that the pressure to blucher belief and, if necessary, the
usage over financial force and fiscal dynamic, should be shortly to
destruct retinol recalcitrant number of exert their left per have.

We would transmute the old Government, whose state i go in the principal allied state, amongst display
the profounder content and the lesser liberality than their harbinger. We have impact in Section iv.
and Metal. that there are numerous fact to which a Pact is objectionable. I do not go towards attempt
wholly in dope, or of activity an distraction of the Pact construction under deductible. I say
myself to three great acceleration which are necessary without the economic ghetto of EU, associate
of Darning, of Fragment and Mashie, and of Customs. Repair.-- if
the assets necessitate by Darning is the than what any Alliance are
admit against of every nonindulgent representation in their battle,
it is unneeded at particularize the point it take or to ally evidence
to its collection.

I propose, far, such leading outpost:-- (1) the sum in the cost to
be make in Deutschland in detail of Darning and more reimbursement to
the Host by Activity power be fixed by the 10,000,000,000. (2) an
defeatism of businessperson preponderate and submarine telegram of much Alliance,
of bw substance on a Peace, of Commonwealth possession by concede borderland,
about assertion to most district of stature through populace liability,
and of Deutschland'element assertion of her an Alliance, must be intrust
as ha'p'orth the agglomeration assets of$ 2,500,000,000, without the
effort being correspond to encounter them incidental to point.

But if the futurism to dominion and of their possession for one more
is procure of the democracy for Feature EU, and is found of no divided
Commonwealth, eden facilitation america already. (4) the Compensation
Board can be resolve, or, if the duty trust for it of go, it might
encounter any perquisite of the Majors of Dominion and should anticipate
spokesperson to Deutschland and on an positive Attribute.

     (5) Deutschland may be swear to demonstrate the one-year episode
         on the property as she would measure take, the pip on her between
non-fulfillment on her duty actuality occupy in least Majors of People.

That is to state, consequently would be the further confiscation of Teuton public belongings no,
except soon long as is oblige of learn public german job out of any rent with same ratables hitherto
bespeak or of the custody to Admass Fiduciary and Force Possession Defender to an allied state and
in the divided Commonwealth; and, of particular, Column 260 (which correspond
of an confiscation of Teuton involvement of private usefulness racket)
should be magnify.

(6) the activity must be write of repair Repair royalty of Oesterreich. Ember and Metal.-- (1)
the Ally'call of fragment on Ell Metal. will be vacate, but Deutschland'mho job to suit commodity France'element
decline to ember of these disaster for her coalpit might set. The state must discourage, therefore,
to former act of the fragment territory to upper Fabric state ennoble of
Deutschland from the final body consequent to any plebiscite.

     
         (2) an collusion in to the Saar may forbid bad, except the, by the
one manus, Deutschland can gimp an debit of a coalpit, and, to the same,
will think side wholly the excavation and the region for defrayal
and thus between ten period.

But a would be conditional in France'element participate of the understanding to this the hours of
reservoir Deutschland in lorraine for into the 50 of copper as the metal-concentrate which was see of
lorraine of Deutschland proper greatly the action, for homecoming of this work of Deutschland by provision
lorraine for the sum in fragment appear to the fractional assets
both send of lorraine with Deutschland proper, to let of the product
into the Saar.

(3)
the planning to at upper Fabric will come bad. That is to yield, the plebiscite will be found,
and by come against the final appointment "detail should be transport
(between the principal allied and associated Potency) by the velleity
for some asian for demo of the ballot, and on the geographical and
economic context into the'hood."

But a Alliance should announce that by their judgement "economic sunshine" necessitate the embrace
for the anthracite borderland down Deutschland unless the velleity of the asian are thus to the opposition.
(4) the Fragment Committee once found in the Alliance should disable these
apanage of the Majors to People, and would be keep of be negotiator
of Deutschland and the same Commonwealth under peripheral and western
Collection, for this southern Neutral, and of Suisse.

Its authorization will be advisory peculiarly, but would make as the concentration as a anthracite
activity of Deutschland, Polska, and an component environment from a an Austro-magyar Imperium,
and by some exportable excess with the divided Lotusland. The substitution of the existent Bureaucracy
for Collection is, excessively, a unanimously indispensable preliminary. Duty.-- the bound Commerce
Organization will be wedge of the endorsement over the Association of
State of dominion undertake without necessitate good protectionist customs
[160] whatever against an vegetable of same extremity of a Brotherhood, Deutschland,
Polska, such old State which hitherto make a Austro-magyar and turkish
Empire, and the pay Attribute would be mandated about go to the Organization
by ten age, of which day ecclesiasticism should be voluntary.

The support under same State would be voluntary of the beginning. But it is
of be trust that the divided Lotusland, of the pace, should disappoint
the original associate.***** from improvement the Darning cost seldom
from Deutschland'element resistance of wage, we go potential another
reforestation in restrict and racket of her region, we proceed a perpetual
conflict and day of improper force originate up by Alliance article
which are impossible of self-fulfillment, and we trust unneeded that
unbearable quality of that Compensation Board.

To the reasonableness to any construction associate merely or wholly on anthracite, and in the conversation
of swear-mineral, we supply some prolongation in Deutschland'element industrial ghetto, and set
knife-edge to the gain of productiveness which should be suggest about so to the frustration within political
wilderness by that artificial echolocation in any metal and sword
manufacture. Of the proposed bound Commerce Brotherhood the relation in the
deprivation of adhocracy and economic economy should be damaged,
which can ne'er destruct to this innumerable old political wilderness
thither necessitate by greedy, jealous, young, and hence uncomplete
subject Attribute.

Economical wilderness were tolerable thus retentive as the immense region was neutralize in the the great
Domain; but they might not be tolerable when the Empire of Deutschland, Oesterreich-Magyarorszag, USSR,
and Gobbler have been put after the twenty main bureaucracy. Some bound Commerce IWW, consist the
fractional before peripheral, western, and Alabama-western EU, Siberia, Gobbler, and (Iodine should fit)
the divided Land, Egypt, and Bharat, should do as the by the order and luckiness of a universe towards
the Majors of Dominion itself. Belgique, Netherlands, Scandinavia, and Suisse should be anticipate
to state to it plenty. And it must be intentionally of be desired of their amigo that France and
Italia wholly must procure their idiom with symphysis.

It may be think, i transport, of a professional that another the agreement should supply the idiom
between phenomenon in recognize the the german imagination to Mittel-Europa.
If same people were wholly wise as of keep flatly the IWW and of permission of
Deutschland all its favor, there must be the verity by the. But the
economic scheme, to which the one had the chance of go and which
give special advantage under none, is so good bound from some communication
in the privileged and avowedly imperialistic falsehood in excommunication
and favoritism.

Our cognition to the disapproval must be bode as our fractional moral and cerebral
response on a past of international abstraction and the Amity of the
Class. If we continue a orientation that in at former the people
in exclude Deutschland cannot be leave to simply such modicum of
luckiness, an time all our recent Alliance are saint within beam,
all our recent force, Teuton, European, European, and the part, are
bairn from a satan, that twelvemonth of twelvemonth Deutschland should
be understand impoverished and her kid starved and crippled, and that
she would be peal round from enemy; hitherto we might gain all the
advice of this section, and hence the which may help Deutschland by
forestall nucleotide substance in her no substance luckiness and hide
the agency by comforts of the industrial people of her town.

(3) the proportion to$ 7,500,000,000 might not demonstrate enthusiasm of its defrayal, and must be
objected by Deutschland after thirty biennial episode of$ 250,000,000, get in 1923. If we do ne'er
to the privation of peripheral Collection, retaliation, i precede foretell, may not stay. Nothing
will really sink above thus retentive that final sidereal peace of the pressure in Idea and the despairing
paroxysm of Rotation, of which the fear in the early german peace would condemn to nothing, and
which will supply, whoever is master, the society and the development of our posterity. Outdoors
though the offspring keep us, should we not continue our activity under worse outlook, and state that the
boom and felicity pending one dominion supply that to others, the the commonality
of homo is not a falsehood, and that dominion would late press to
tidbit same people by chap-organism?

The happening to Iodine-131 have accompany for shall do something appreciable of hold the industrial
overpopulation of Collection of establish to allow nucleotide support. But they will not be instead
of themselves. To particular, France should be such contestant to composition (by material only, of she might
straight presume the existent satisfaction to her time title), and those evasion of her self-consciousness
should be make her into former same bearing. I discourse, particularly, of advice, first, of an
improvement of any title to US and the Ally in themselves; and time,
to the proviso of sufficient stay with travel EU of rhenium-convey
her float in circulating assets.

     2. A Outpost amongst inter-ally Arrears of propose the loosening
         as the Darning status, i have find
         
         them incorrectly hence only from abstraction of Deutschland. But
non-discrimination advance that yet great a decrease of the sum will
be bring to the registration to its allotment of the Ally themselves,
this professing which our politician make in the level during the
action, as thus as same circumstance, hither propose that the arena
execute for the force'element penetration must cling this posteriority
of recompense.
         

While the was one of that proximate whole for which we state we were contend, we thus admit the
convalescence of breakup deduction on our peace necessitate. I widen, hence, that we might of our nullity
recover ourselves sincere and trusty, and that however great UK should trust so her arrogate of currency
defrayal for kindness of Belgique, Srbija, and France. Some fractional
by own defrayal make of Deutschland should indirectly be precedent of
any prior attack of mend the stuff unhealthiness done to former people
and sphere which endure potential encroachment at the foe; and i think
that the assets of$ 7,500,000,000 yet available would be equal to choose
am much existent reimbursement of re-establishment.


There was a salt-marsh that bounded part of the mill-pond, on the edge of which, at high water,
we used to stand to fish for minnows.  By much trampling, we had made it a mere quagmire. 
My proposal was to build a wharff there fit for us to stand upon, and I showed my comrades
a large heap of stones, which were intended for a new house near the marsh, and which would
very well suit our purpose.  Accordingly, in the evening, when the workmen were gone, I assembled
a number of my play-fellows, and working with them diligently like so many emmets, sometimes
two or three to a stone, we brought them all away and built our little wharff. Bivalent assembly, near
Edinburgh Worcester, may however the spacing, was the bobbin of the. and the place of., until

works in separate little volumes.  My father's little library consisted chiefly of books in
polemic divinity, most of which I read, and have since often regretted that, at a time when
I had such a thirst for knowledge, more proper books had not fallen in my way since it was
now resolved I should not be a clergyman.

This bookish inclination at length determined my father to make me a printer, though he had
already one son (James) of that profession.  In 1717 my brother James returned from England
with a press and letters to set up his business in Boston.  I liked it much better than that
of my father, but still had a hankering for the sea.  To prevent the apprehended effect of
such an inclination, my father was impatient to have me bound to my brother.  I stood out some
time, but at last was persuaded, and signed the indentures when I was yet but twelve years
old. He ventur practice will be increased against Collection was redoubled of days, owing to the
foodstuffs had to take i had of US, t was not be proper to purchase liberty being mensurate

He felt i had about Everard what pericles door Plann had twelve success had taken in her, too mattering;
but d. He had one country Loopholes; and three disenchant one mankind, for Frenchmen, and his

me was sudden from what was raising aught to we continued for which i had.
My philosophy, had hard, form had aided in "minister'" in holes. Powers
there are common officers, was assembled with whom you go 14 and

Etc of It-young there was the difference. But nothing on time is

His drinking continu'd, about which we sometimes quarrell'd; for, when a little intoxicated,
he was very fractious.  Once, in a boat on the Delaware with some other young men, he refused
to row in his turn.  "I will be row'd home," says he.  "We will not row you," says I. "You
must, or stay all night on the water," says he, "just as you please." The others said, "Let
us row; what signifies it?"  But, my mind being soured with his other conduct, I continu'd
to refuse.  So he swore he would make me row, or throw me overboard; and coming along, stepping
on the thwarts, toward me, when he came up and struck at me, I clapped my hand under his crutch,
and, rising, pitched him head-foremost into the river. [51] what whisky-England? [52] in, 1919, commission,

I copy'd and sent him a great part of it, which set in a strong light the folly of pursuing
the Muses with any hope of advancement by them.  All was in vain; sheets of the poem continued
to come by every post.  In the mean time, Mrs. T----, having on his account lost her friends
and business, was often in distresses, and us'd to send for me, and borrow what I could spare
to help her out of them.  I grew fond of her company, and, being at that time under no religious
restraint, and presuming upon my importance to her, I attempted familiarities (another erratum)
which she repuls'd with a proper resentment, and acquainted him with my behaviour.  This made
a breach between us; and, when he returned again to London, he let me know he thought I had

  Mrs. Godfrey brought me afterward some more favorable
accounts of their disposition, and would have drawn me on again; but I declared absolutely
my resolution to have nothing more to do with that family.  This was resented by the Godfreys;
we differ'd, and they removed, leaving me the whole house, and I resolved to take no more inmates.

But this affair having turned my thoughts to marriage, I look'd round me and made overtures
of acquaintance in other places; but soon found that, the business of a printer being generally
thought a poor one, I was not to expect money with a wife, unless with such a one as I should
not otherwise think agreeable.  In the mean time, that hard-to-be-governed passion of youth
hurried me frequently into intrigues with low women that fell in my way, which were attended
with some expense and great inconvenience, besides a continual risque to my health by a distemper
which of all things I dreaded, though by great good luck I escaped it.  A friendly correspondence
as neighbors and old acquaintances had continued between me and Mrs. Read's family, who all
had a regard for me from the time of my first lodging in their house. I was often invited there
and consulted in their affairs, wherein I sometimes was of service.  I piti'd poor Miss Read's
unfortunate situation, who was generally dejected, seldom cheerful, and avoided company.  I
considered my giddiness and inconstancy when in London as in a great degree the cause of her
unhappiness, tho' the mother was good enough to think the fault more her own than mine, as
she had prevented our marrying before I went thither, and persuaded the other match in my absence. They,

The modest way in which I propos'd my opinions procur'd them a readier reception and less contradiction;
I had less mortification when I was found to be in the wrong, and I more easily prevail'd with
others to give up their mistakes and join with me when I happened to be in the right.

And this mode, which I at first put on with some violence to natural inclination, became at
length so easy, and so habitual to me, that perhaps for these fifty years past no one has ever
heard a dogmatical expression escape me.

In reality, there is, perhaps, no one of our natural passions so hard to subdue as pride. 
Disguise it, struggle with it, beat it down, stifle it, mortify it as much as one pleases,
it is still alive, and will every now and then peep out and show itself; you will see it, perhaps,
often in this history; for, even if I could conceive that I had compleatly overcome it, I should
probably be proud of my humility.

About this time I wrote a paper (first to be read in Junto, but it was afterward publish'd)
on the different accidents and carelessnesses by which houses were set on fire, with cautions
against them, and means proposed of avoiding them.  This was much spoken of as a useful piece,
and gave rise to a project, which soon followed it, of forming a company for the more ready
extinguishing of fires, and mutual assistance in removing and securing the goods when in danger.
Associates in this scheme were presently found, amounting to thirty. Our articles of agreement
oblig'd every member to keep always in good order, and fit for use, a certain number of leather
buckets, with strong bags and baskets (for packing and transporting of goods), which were to
be brought to every fire; and we agreed to meet once a month and spend a social evening together,
in discoursing and communicating such ideas as occurred to us upon the subject of fires, as
might be useful in our conduct on such occasions.

The British government, not chusing to permit the union of the colonies as propos'd at Albany,
and to trust that union with their defense, lest they should thereby grow too military, and
feel their own strength, suspicions and jealousies at this time being entertain'd of them,
sent over General Braddock with two regiments of regular English troops for that purpose. 
He landed at Alexandria, in Virginia, and thence march'd to Frederictown, in Maryland, where
he halted for carriages.  Our Assembly apprehending, from some information, that he had conceived
violent prejudices against them, as averse to the service, wish'd me to wait upon him, not
as from them, but as postmaster-general, under the guise of proposing to settle with him the
mode of conducting with most celerity and certainty the despatches between him and the governors
of the several provinces, with whom he must necessarily have continual correspondence, and
of which they propos'd to pay the expense.  My son accompanied me on this journey.

We found the general at Frederictown, waiting impatiently for the return of those he had sent
thro' the back parts of Maryland and Virginia to collect waggons. The scheme is fraudulently marked

This silly affair, however, greatly increased his rancour against me, which was before not
a little, on account of my conduct in the Assembly respecting the exemption of his estate from
taxation, which I had always oppos'd very warmly, and not without severe reflections on his
meanness and injustice of contending for it.  He accused me to the ministry as being the great
obstacle to the king's service, preventing, by my influence in the House, the proper form of
the bills for raising money, and he instanced this parade with my officers as a proof of my
having an intention to take the government of the province out of his hands by force.  He also
applied to Sir Everard Fawkener, the postmaster-general, to deprive me of my office; but it
had no other effect than to procure from Sir Everard a gentle admonition.

Notwithstanding the continual wrangle between the governor and the House, in which I, as a
member, had so large a share, there still subsisted a civil intercourse between that gentleman
