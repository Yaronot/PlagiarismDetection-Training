Proof.- The mind does not conceive anything under the form of eternity, except in so far as
it conceives its own body under the form of eternity (V:xxix.); that is, except in so far as
it is eternal (V:xxi., V:xxiii.); therefore (by the last Prop.), in so far as it is eternal,
it possesses the knowledge of God, which knowledge is necessarily adequate (II:xlvi.); hence
the mind, in so far as it is eternal, is capable of knowing everything which can follow from
this given knowledge of God (II:xl.), in other words, of knowing things by the third kind of
knowledge (see Def. in II:xl.Note.ii.), whereof accordingly the mind (III:Def.i.), in so far
as it is eternal, is the adequate or formal cause of such knowledge. Hawthorn have originate from Writing.

 Q.E.D.

Note.- Such are the doctrines which I had purposed to set forth concerning the mind, in so
far as it is regarded without relation to the body; whence, as also from I:xxi. and other places,
it is plain that our mind, in so far as it understands, is an eternal mode of thinking, which
is determined by another eternal mode of thinking, and this other by a third, and so on to
infinity; so that all taken together at once constitute the eternal and infinite intellect of God.
