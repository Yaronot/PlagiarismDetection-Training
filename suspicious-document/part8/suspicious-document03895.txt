 Such immediate revelation is
granted at this day because this is what is meant by the Coming of the Lord.

2. I. THE GOD OF HEAVEN IS THE LORD

First of all it must be known who the God of heaven is, since upon that all the other things
depend. Throughout all heaven no other than the Lord alone is acknowledged as the God of heaven.
There it is said, as He Himself taught,

     That He is one with the Father; that the Father is in Him,
     and He in the Father; that he who sees Him sees the
     Father; and that everything that is holy goes forth from
     Him (John 10:30, 35; 14:9-11; 16:13-15).

I have often talked with angels on this subject, and they have invariably declared that in
heaven they are unable to divide the Divine into three, because they know and perceive that
the Divine is One and this One is in the Lord. They also said that those of the church who
come from this world having an idea of three Divine beings cannot be admitted into heaven,
since their thought wanders from one Divine being to another; and it is not allowable there
to think three and say one.{1} Because in heaven everyone speaks from his thought, since speech
there is the immediate product of the thought, or the thought speaking. Consequently, those
in this world who have divided the Divine into three, and have adopted a different idea of
each, and have not made that idea one and centered it in the Lord, cannot be received into
heaven, because in heaven there is a sharing of all thoughts, and therefore if any one came
thinking three and saying one, he would be at once found out and rejected. But let it be known
that all those who have not separated what is true from what is good, or faith from love, accept
in the other life, when they have been taught, the heavenly idea of the Lord, that He is the
God of the universe. It is otherwise with those who have separated faith from life, that is,
who have not lived according to the precepts of true faith.

  {Footnote 1} Christians were examined in the other life in
  regard to their idea of the one God and it was found that they
  held the idea of three Gods (n. 2329, 5256, 10736, 10738,
  10821). A Divine trinity in the Lord is acknowledged in heaven
  (n. 14, 15, 1729, 2005, 5256, 9303).

3. Those within the church who have denied the Lord and have acknowledged the Father only,
and have confirmed themselves in that belief, are not in heaven; and as they are unable to
receive any influx from heaven, where the Lord alone is worshiped, they gradually lose the
ability to think what is true about any subject whatever; and finally they become as if dumb,
or they talk stupidly, and ramble about with their arms dangling and swinging as if weak in
the joints. Again, those who, like the Socinians, have denied the Divinity of the Lord and
have acknowledged His Humanity only, are likewise outside of heaven; they are brought forward
a little towards the right and are let down into the deep, and are thus wholly separated from
the rest that come from the Christian world. Finally, those who profess to believe in an invisible
Divine, which they call the soul of the universe [Ens universi], from which all things originated,
and who reject all belief in the Lord, find out that they believe in no God; since this invisible
Divine is to them a property of nature in her first principles, which cannot be an object of
faith and love, because it is not an object of thought.{1} Such have their lot among those
called Naturalists. It is otherwise with those born outside the church, who are called the
heathen; these will be treated of hereafter.

  {Footnote 1} A Divine that cannot be perceived by any idea
  cannot be received by faith (n. 4733, 5110, 5663, 6982, 6996,
  7004, 7211, 9356, 9359, 9972, 10067, 10267).

4. Infants, who form a third part of heaven, are all initiated into the acknowledgment and
belief that the Lord is their Father, and afterwards that He is the Lord of all, thus the God
of heaven and earth. That children grow up in heaven and are perfected by means of knowledges,
even to angelic intelligence and wisdom, will be seen in the following pages.

5. Those who are of the church cannot doubt that the Lord is the God of heaven, for He Himself
taught,

     That all things of the Father are His (Matt. 11:27; John
     16:15; 17:2).

     And that He hath all power in heaven and on earth (Matt.
     28:18).

He says "in heaven and on earth," because He that rules heaven rules the earth also, for the
one depends upon the other.{1} "Ruling heaven and earth" means to receive from the Lord every
good pertaining to love and every truth pertaining to faith, thus all intelligence and wisdom,
and in consequence all happiness, in a word, eternal life. This also the Lord taught when He said:

     He that believeth on the Son hath eternal life; but he
     that believeth not the Son shall not see life (John 3:36).

Again:

     I am the resurrection and the life; he that believeth on
     Me, though he die yet shall he live; and whosoever liveth
     and believeth on Me shall never die (John 11:26, 26).

And again:

     I am the way, the truth, and the life (John 14:6).

  {Footnote 1} The entire heaven is the Lord's (n. 2751, 7086).
  He has all power in the heavens and on the earths (n. 1607,
  10089, 10827). As the Lord rules heaven He rules also all
  things that depend thereon, thus all things in the world (n.
  2026, 2027, 4523, 4524). The Lord alone has power to remove the
  hells, to withhold from evil and hold in good, and thus to save
  (n. 10019).

6. There were certain spirits who while living in the world had professed to believe in the
Father; but of the Lord they had the same idea as of any other man, and therefore did not believe
Him to be the God of heaven. For this reason they were permitted to wander about and inquire
wherever they wished whether there were any other heaven than the heaven of the Lord. They
searched for several days, but nowhere found any. Do i had no sooner conceived this thought than
my desire known myself upon one object, to see kondjé-Gul can again. In the centre of the edifice
is a hall, by the daylight is admitted by a cupola of ground glass, supported by pillars of
white marble.

I knew all the domestic arrangements of El Nouzha. Ought i to wait till the day to dissipate their
doubts, and justify itself for such strange coldness-- coldness what may have seemed like indifference?
 And as the Divine that goes forth from the Lord is
the good of love and the truth of faith, the angels are angels and are heaven in the measure
in which they receive good and truth from the Lord.

8. Everyone in the heavens knows and believes and even perceives that he wills and does nothing
of good from himself, and that he thinks and believes nothing of truth from himself, but only
from the Divine, thus from the Lord; also that good from himself is not good, and truth from
himself is not truth, because these have in them no life from the Divine. Moreover, the angels
of the inmost heaven clearly perceive and feel the influx, and the more of it they receive
the more they seem to themselves to be in heaven, because the more are they in love and faith
and in the light of intelligence and wisdom, and in heavenly joy therefrom; and since all these
go forth from the Divine of the Lord, and in these the angels have their heaven, it is clear
that it is the Divine of the Lord, and not the angels from anything properly their own that
makes heaven.{1} This is why heaven is called in the Word the "dwelling-place" of the Lord
and "His throne," and those who are there are said to be in the Lord.{2} But in what manner
the Divine goes forth from the Lord and fills heaven will be told in what follows.

  {Footnote 1} The angels of heaven acknowledge all good to be
  from the Lord, and nothing from themselves, and the Lord dwells
  in them in His own and not in their own (n. 9338, 10125, 10151,
  10157). Therefore in the Word by "angels" something of the Lord
  is meant (n. 1925, 2821, 3039, 4085, 8192, 10528). Furthermore,
  angels are called "gods" from the reception of the Divine from
  the Lord (n. 4295, 4402, 7268, 7873, 8192, 8301). Again, all
  good that is good, and all truth that is truth, consequently
  all peace, love, charity, and faith, are from the Lord (n.
  1614, 2016, 2751, 2882, 2883, 2891, 2892, 2904). Also all
  wisdom and intelligence (n. 109, 112, 121, 124).

  {Footnote 2} Those who are in heaven are said to be in the Lord
  (n. 3637, 3638).

9. Angels from their wisdom go still further. They say that not only everything good and true
is from the Lord, but everything of life as well. They confirm it by this, that nothing can
spring from itself, but only from something prior to itself; therefore all things spring from
a First, which they call the very Being [Esse] of the life of all things. And in like manner
all things continue to exist, for continuous existence is a ceaseless springing forth, and
whatever is not continually held by means of intermediates in connection with the First instantly
disperses and is wholly dissipated. They say also that there is but One Fountain of life, and
that man's life is a rivulet therefrom, which if it did not unceasingly continue from its fountain
would immediately flow away. [2] Again, they say that from this One Fountain of life, which
is the Lord, nothing goes forth except Divine good and Divine truth, and that each one is affected
by these in accordance with his reception of them, those who receive them in faith and life
find heaven in them while those who reject them or stifle them change them into hell; for they
change good into evil and truth into falsity, thus life into death. Again, that everything
of life is from the Lord they confirm by this: that all things in the universe have relation
to good and truth,-the life of man's will, which is the life of his love, to good; and the
life of his understanding, which is the life of his faith, to truth; and since everything good
and true comes from above it follows that everything of life must come from above. [3] This
being the belief of the angels they refuse all thanks for the good they do, and are displeased
and withdraw if any one attributes good to them. Oh stop, my dear nephew! "she added in an engaging
tone," a family scene is an instructive act; it forms----. That will teach that you the phenomenon
of not take them with you on your travels. Was it besides on account
of this trip in Abyssinia that I have not seen you for two years? But doing good for the sake of good they call
good from the Divine; and this they say is the good that makes heaven, because this good is
the Lord.{1}

  {Footnote 1} Good from the Lord has the Lord inwardly in it,
  but good from one's own has not (n. 1802, 3951, 8480).

10. Such spirits as have confirmed themselves during their life in the world in the belief
that the good they do and the truth they believe is from themselves, or is appropriated to
them as their own (which is the belief of all who place merit in good actions and claim righteousness
to themselves) are not received into heaven. Angels avoid them. They look upon them as stupid
and as thieves; as stupid because they continually have themselves in view and not the Divine;
and as thieves because they steal from the Lord what is His. These are averse to the belief
of heaven, that it is the Divine of the Lord in the angels that makes heaven.

11.

12. From all this it can now be seen that the Lord dwells in the angels of heaven in what is
His own, and thus that the Lord is the all in all things of heaven; and this for the reason
that good from the Lord is the Lord in angels, for what is from the Lord is the Lord; consequently
heaven to the angels is good from the Lord, and not anything of their own.

13. III. IN HEAVEN THE DIVINE OF THE LORD IS LOVE TO HIM AND CHARITY TOWARDS THE NEIGHBOR.

The Divine that goes forth from the Lord is called in heaven Divine truth, for a reason that
will presently appear. This Divine truth flows into heaven from the Lord from His Divine love.
The Divine love and the Divine truth therefrom are related to each other as the fire of the
sun and the light therefrom in the world, love resembling the fire of the sun and truth therefrom
light from the sun. Moreover, by correspondence fire signifies love, and light truth going
forth from love.{1} From this it is clear what the Divine truth that goes forth from the Lord's
Divine love is-that in its essence it is Divine good joined to Divine truth, and being so conjoined
it vivifies all things of heaven; just as in the world when the sun's heat is joined to light
it makes all things of the earth fruitful, which takes place in spring and summer. It is otherwise
when the heat is not joined with the light, that is, when the light is cold; then all things
become torpid and lie dead. With the angels this Divine good, which is compared to heat, is
the good of love; and Divine truth, which is compared to light, is that through which and out
of which good of love comes.

  {Footnote 1} In the Word "fire" signifies heavenly love and
  infernal love (n. 934, 4906, 5215). "Holy and heavenly fire"
  signifies Divine love, and every affection that belongs to that
  love (n. 934, 6314, 6832). "Light" from fire signifies truth
  going forth from good of love; and light in heaven signifies
  Divine truth (n. 3195, 3485, 3636, 3643, 3993, 4302, 4413,
  4415, 9548, 9684).

14. The Divine in heaven which makes heaven is love, because love is spiritual conjunction.
It conjoins angels to the Lord and conjoins them to one another, so conjoining them that in
the Lord's sight they are all as one. Moreover, love is the very being [esse] of everyone's
life; consequently from love both angels and men have life. Everyone who reflects can know
that the inmost vitality of man is from love, since he grows warm from the presence of love
and cold from its absence, and when deprived of it he dies.{1} But it is to be remembered that
the quality of his love is what determines the quality of each one's life.

  {Footnote 1} Love is the fire of life, and life itself is
  actually therefrom (n. 4906, 5071, 6032, 6314).

15. In heaven there are two distinct loves, love to the Lord and love towards the neighbor,
in the inmost or third heaven love to the Lord, in the second or middle heaven love towards
the neighbor. They both go forth from the Lord, and they both make heaven. How these two loves
are distinct and how they are conjoined is seen in heaven in clear light, but in the world
only obscurely. In heaven loving the Lord does not mean loving Him in respect to His person,
but it means loving the good that is from Him; and to love good is to will and do good from
love; and to love the neighbor does not mean loving a companion in respect to his person, but
loving the truth that is from the Word; and to love truth is to will and do it. Of course i
refused at well to permit such irregularity, contrary as it was to all harem habit. This refusal was the
signal for a scene of tears and astonished passions, which i subdued, but which once gave
way to the tender reproaches of still affections.

  As, i try to jog along only well as i can, as all husbands
  have to do, but i have a vague presentiment of troubles jealous
  in the air.

I have reopened my letter.

I hope you won't be slighted, my
dear chap, but-- I have another piece of news relating to barbassou-Authority.


  {Footnote 2} To love the neighbor is not to love the person,
  but to love that in him from which he is what he is, that is,
  his truth and good (n. 5028. 10336). Those who love the person,
  and not that in him from which he is what he is, love evil and
  good alike (n. 3820). Charity is willing truths and being
  affected by truths for the sake of truths (n. 3876, 3877).
  Charity towards the neighbor is doing what is good, just, and
  right, in every work and in every function (n. 8120-8122).

16. I have repeatedly talked with angels about this matter. They were astonished, they said,
that men of the church do not know that to love the Lord and to love the neighbor is to love
what is good and true, and to do this from the will, when they ought to know that one evinces
love by willing and doing what another wishes, and it is this that brings reciprocal love and
conjunction, and not loving another without doing what he wishes, which in itself is not loving;
also that men should know that the good that goes forth from the Lord is a likeness of Him,
since He is in it; and that those who make good and truth to belong to their life by willing
them and doing them become likenesses of the Lord and are conjoined to Him. Willing is loving
to do. That this is so the Lord teaches in the Word, saying,

     He that hath My commandments and doeth them, he it is that
     loveth Me; and I will love him and will make My abode with
     him (John 14:21, 23).

And again:

     If ye do My commandments ye shall abide in My love (John
     15:10).

17. All experience in heaven attests that the Divine that goes forth from the Lord and that
affects angels and makes heaven is love; for all who are in heaven are forms of love and charity,
and appear in ineffable beauty, with love shining forth from their faces, and from their speech
and from every particular of their life.{1} Moreover, there are spiritual spheres of life emanating
from and surrounding every angel and every spirit, by which their quality in respect to the
affections of their love is known, sometimes at a great distance. For with everyone these spheres
flow forth from the life of his affection and consequent thought, or from the life of his love
and consequent faith. The spheres that go forth from angels are so full of love as to affect
the inmosts of life of those who are with them. They have repeatedly been perceived by me and
have thus affected me.{2} That it is love from which angels have their life is further evident
from the fact that in the other life everyone turns himself in accordance with his love-those
who are in love to the Lord and in love towards the neighbor turning themselves always to the
Lord, while those who are in love of self turn themselves always away from the Lord. This is
so, however their bodies may turn, since with those in the other life spaces conform to the
states of their interiors, likewise quarters, which are not constant as they are in this world,
but are determined in accordance with the direction of their faces. And yet it is not the angels
that turn themselves to the Lord; but the Lord turns to Himself those that love to do the things
that are from Him.{3} But more on this subject hereafter, where the quarters in the other life
are treated of.

  {Footnote 1} Angels are forms of love and charity (n. 3804,
  4735, 4797, 4985, 5199, 5530, 9879, 10177).

  {Footnote 2} A spiritual sphere, which is a sphere of the life,
  overflows and pours forth from every man, spirit, and angel,
  and encompasses them (n. 4464, 5179, 7454, 8630). It flows from
  the life of their affection and consequent thought (n. 2489,
  4464, 6206).

  {Footnote 3} Spirits and angels turn themselves constantly to
  their loves, and those in the heavens turn themselves
  constantly to the Lord (n. 10130, 10189, 10420, 10702).
  Quarters in the other life are to each one in accordance with
  the direction of his face, and are thereby determined,
  otherwise than in the world (n. 10130, 10189, 10420, 10702).
