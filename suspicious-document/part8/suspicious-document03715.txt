He talked so much I think the Old Man spun the yarn just to shut him up. He had talked ever
since his arrival on board, early that morning, with a letter from the owners' agent, and the
announcement he intended making the voyage with us.  He had weak lungs, he said, and was in
search of mild, tropical breezes.  Also, he was seeking local color, and whatever information
he could pick up about "King" Waldon.

He had heard of the death of "King" Waldon, down in Samoa--Waldon, the trader, of the vanishing
race of island adventurers--and he expected to travel about the south seas investigating the
"king's" past, so he could write a book about the old viking.  He had heard that Captain Shreve
had known Waldon.  Hence, he was honoring a cargo carrier with his presence instead of taking
his ease upon a mail-boat.

Captain Shreve must tell him all he knew about the "king."  He was intensely interested in
the subject.  Splendid material, you know. That romantic legend of Waldon's arrival in the
islands--too good to be true, and certainly too good not to put into a book.  Was Captain Shreve
familiar with the tale?  How this fellow, Waldon, sailed into a Samoan harbor in an open boat,
his only companion his beautiful young wife?  Imagine--this man and woman coming from nowhere,
sailing in from the open sea in a small boat, never telling whence they came!

He said this was the stuff to go into his book.  Romance, mystery!  It was quite as important
as the later and better known incidents in the "king's" life.  That was why Captain Shreve
must tell him all he knew about the fellow. All merely human in situations such as the scene on the Mount of
Olives, then to the enjoyment. Throughout the Ammergau nativity play suffers from a major fault:
it is no longer naive and not art. In this fluctuating middle of
the audience is rocked back and forth.

Others, including an actor judge milder. Perhaps the reader will be pleasant to hear in this connection
the opinion of a great actor. In an exchange of letters in which were among the art of acting, I wrote
Adolph Sonnenthal: "So my Ammergau impressions you want to know?

Well, I did that, and that powerful impressions, but unfortunately through the often protracted in the act
by disturbing the interaction of individual, as Judas and Mary Magdalene, her back was paralyzed, and
yet gave me the cast of the Christ all over again in the right mood, so I in the main action, in the crucifixion,
was taken very deeply and leaving the game had only one thought: if any actor could be the
role so perfectly. Talk he would necessarily act better, but? I think not. The action of the Last
Supper and the death of every great artist could redound to the glory of work. The majesty and
mildness, and I'd say the grace with which this man was washing his disciples' feet, has almost
put me in astonishment. The incarnation of suffering in the expression, while the superhuman
Duldermiene on the cross, the last moments when he breaks the eye and the head hard on the chest falls,
still looking with a broken eye his mother - I know no actor who could do better and that this man
is just not an actor, but a simple person and wood carver, has me more than an artistic, which I made
a solemn impression. That is the impression I received that in the catchment Christ in Jerusalem,
in the Cross, and if only the other players close to the natural talent Mayers had, then the
impression would be a general. They talked too much, and you expected an artistic ensemble.
That's not my view and it should not be to even if it really produce a religious effect is. It should
not just be downright annoying, like Judas and Mary Magdalene. I liked some things even more naive,
more natural. The artistic intervention by the Munich artist in recent years, the nature of
the case appeared to hurt, it makes you now and then but is reminiscent of the theater, and although
a bad theater, and that's the disadvantage. Your impression of the way, is not isolated, I have
spoken many who share your sentiment entirely. A few days ago I was in Kynzvart at the Princess
Metternich, and while the dinner is talk of Oberammergau, and the princess was expecting a letter
from her daughter, Princess Oettingen who also attended the Passion Play and promised to write about
it because they themselves was not there. After dinner came the letter correctly, and the Princess read
it before us. In general, they now spoke from your view, but a witty remark she made about Christ, which
is very significant. She said: he played to humble, comme s'il n'Ã©tait pas digne # d'Ãªtre JÃ©sus
# I had to contradict her, for it is precisely the view if this view of the speech can be, the purely
human, made me this God brought people closer and - you do not smile, I believed in him, but
only up to the moment when he rose from the grave. Here I was again reminded too much of the
comedy. I have said nothing about the establishment of the theater, so I was almost sublime.
You too? The scene of the court. Pontius on the balcony, under the same captive Christ, to the
right the people on the left, the priest, that was a great impression.


The Captain's eyes were upon this tow.  He tugged excitedly at his beard.  "Well, by George,
what a coincidence!" he exclaimed.  He turned to the mate, his bright eyes snapping.  "Look,
Briggs!  Do you know her?  By George, do you recognize her?"

The writing guy was disgusted by this interruption, just when he was going to prove his genius.
Briggs shifted his quid, spat, and inspected the passing hulk with extreme deliberation.  I
looked at her too, wondering what there was about an old coal-carrier that could pierce Captain
Shreve's accustomed phlegm.

The tow was passing abreast, but a couple of hundred yards distant. The tug was shortening
the line, and on the hulk's forecastle-head a couple of hands were busy at a cathead, preparing
to let go anchor. She was ill-favored enough to look at, that hulk--weather-beaten, begrimed,
stripped of all that makes a ship sightly.  Nothing but the worn-out old hull was left.  An
eyesore, truly.  Yet, any seaman could see with half an eye she had once been a fine ship.
The clipper lines were there.

Suddenly Briggs sat up in his chair, and exclaimed, "Well, blast my eyes, so it is!"  He nodded
to the Captain, and then returned his regard to the hulk, his nostrils working with interest.
"So it is!  So it is!  Well, blast my----"

"Is what?" I demanded.  "What do you two see in that old hull that is so extraordinary?"

Just then the writing guy decided we had monopolized the conversation long enough.  So he seized
the opportunity to exercise for our benefit the rare gift he was endowed with.  He glanced
patronizingly at the coal hulk, wrinkled his nose in disapprobation of her appearance, and
delivered himself in an oracular voice.

"What a horrible looking old tub!  Not a difficult task to invest her with her true personality.
An old workhorse--eh? A pioneer on, Jacob with ax and plow, while William is more of a natural gardener,
which applies on the ground already cleared their dainty flower beds, she waits for care and still
pours. Jakob digging out new creations from the ground, the grammar, mythology, the legal antiquities,
Wilhelm has fitted some old favorite author's embarrassing care and writes thoughtfully searching and
found patiently putting together the story of the heroic saga, its subject by means of certificates
and their own development of external and internal lighting. All of these works and works go but
from the deep bottom of the home feeling, evident from the strong feeling that for the people
nothing more appealing and give more valuable than what already have placed in the home ownership
and living in lingering tradition. Moving along with so urgent action research is on the brothers
Grimm, the child's expression of their attachment to the homeland. So, when William, in view of the
residence of his son in Italy, in the words erupts: "I could in the long run not to live in
another place, so I'm attached to my country," or if Jacob is held all the splendors of the South the
blossoming apple tree and praises to the finches.

The little one is feeling great an art Jakob Grimm.

He and his brother have the gift of the poet's eye, all the things that they may still be so
used, and out of print, always looks for the first time and a beam of wonder and of recognition
can fall for it. Jacob Grimm once said: "All that considered the man is wonderful, language, sound
and word." This view takes in a broad band with his German grammar, which deviates so beneficial
of all that has been called up to that grammar, that it makes us all grammarians. It does not
teach, they do not school masters, it shows just how things are. Grimm often goes out of involuntary
youth impressions which have now become mature science, as the sensual pleasures of the sound
triad # a # # i # # u #, which permeates his vocal singing the whole German language. When we say,
tie, band, bound, it is a single case that we encounter in the German language at every turn.
Every boy, every girl who visits an elementary school knows today, that is, a verb which is modified
with the sound of jewelry and harmony, a strong verb, while the weak verb devoid of ornaments. Before
Grimm was all wrong the weak verb regularly, but the strong, but spurned the outer appendage and
the different times produced by a powerful inner drive by itself, irregular. Jacob Grimm has
here the schoolmasters aufgezÃ¼ndet a light in which they saw that and realized what they had previously
encountered only. Grimm does not have much else discovered this hitherto so dry letter being. More powerful,
he pressed forward in his grammar, always, as directed in all his investigations, a strong
sense of home. His people he wanted to see in his language. He showed how the German language, the
great contrast between the sexes, which divides the people and binds to extend to the rest of
creation by a peculiar imagination fortune he poured the whole German language to represent
the ideas and moral directions of the German mind quasi herbeizufÃ¶rdern Vorelemente to a
German national psychology and ethics. He made it also clear in the German personal name, in which the
German nature, as we have understood the meaning of the word uttered or felt, as varied and
distinct. A name that one attributes to a child is a desire or even the fullness of desire: an ideal.
Grimm went into this investigation without any preconceived ideas
or secret tendency.

"The dangerous life of the sailor, I presume," drawled the writing guy. "Falling from aloft,
and being washed overboard, and all that sort of thing."

"Not always," retorted Captain Shreve.  "There were other ways of going to Davy Jones in the
old clipper days--and in these days, also, for that matter.  Knives, for instance, or bullets,
or a pair of furious hands--if you care for violent tragedy.  But I did not mean the physical
dangers of life, particularly; I meant, rather, that Fate tangles lives on board ship as queerly
as in cities ashore.  I meant that the Golden Bough, in her day, left her mark upon a good
many lives.  She broke men, and made them.  And once, I know, she had to do with a woman's
life, and a woman's love.  There was a wedding performed upon that ship upon the high seas,
and a dead man sprawled on the deck at the feet of the nuptial pair, and the bride was the
dead man's widow!"

"Oh, come now--" said the writing guy.  It was plain he thought the skipper was stringing him.
But I knew how difficult it was to get our Old Man to spin a yarn, and I was determined he
should not be shunted off on a new tack.  I interrupted the author, hurriedly.  "Did you ever
make a voyage in the Golden Bough, Captain?" I asked.

"Yes," replied the Captain.  "I was a witness to that wedding; and I played my small part in
bringing it about.  Yes, that old wreck yonder has had a good deal to do with my own life.
I received my first boost upward in the Golden Bough.  Shipped in the foc'sle, and ended the
voyage in the cabin.  Stepped into dead man's shoes.  And more important than that--I won my
manhood on those old decks."

"Ah, performed some valorous deed?" purred the writing guy.

"No; I abstained from performing an infamous deed," said Captain Shreve.  "I think that is
the way most men win to manhood."

"Oh!" said the writing guy.  He seemed about to say a lot more, when I put my oar in again.

"Let us have the yarn, Captain," I begged.

Captain Shreve squinted at the sun, and then favored the passenger with one of his rare smiles.
"Why, yes," he said. To raise the forest system to adopt the scheme, a new forestry law was the Hungarian
State Forestry Association has rendered outstanding. The training of foresters takes place at the
Štiavnica Mining and Forestry Academy.

Mining and industry.

With respect to its mineral resources is one of the richest countries in Europe U.: it has inexhaustible
salt, iron and coal deposits and immensely rich copper, silver, gold and other veins. In regard
to precious metals it takes up to Russia the next position. Headquarters of gold production is
Transylvania, whose mines (Abrudbánya, Böröspatak, Almas, Offenbánya etc.) is already the Romans
were known. In the actual U. are rich gold and silver mines in Kremnitz, Schemnitz, Nagy and
Felsöbánya etc., is also in the rivers Aranyos, Maros, Szamos etc. river and wash gold, silver in
large quantities and Schmollnitz Oravicza won. The richest and oldest copper mines, which reduces
yield but are in Margitfalva, Szép Igló, Schmollnitz, Libethen, Nagybánya etc. in the Zips. Rich
iron ores are found Zips in the counties, and Gomori Abauj-Torna. Most lead is in the Štiavnica
Mountains District, much nickel and cobalt in Dobschau and Libethen, antimony and mercury in Rosenau,
Magurka Schmollnitz and won. Of precious stones deserves a special mention of the precious
opal, the only home U. (state opal mines to Vörösvágás in Sarose and Nagy Mihály in Zemplin County)
is. The largest opal found there (in the Imperial Natural History Collection in Vienna) is estimated
at 2 million guilders. There will also be chalcedony, garnet, hyacinth, amethyst, Carnelian, agate,
rock crystal (Marmaros diamonds), tourmaline, quartz crystals and quartz, fluorite, Hornstein,
Töpferthon excellent and china clay in many places, slates in Borsod County and at Marienthal in
Bratislava. The best millstones Geletnek supplies in the county Barse. Marble is quarried in the
county Zips, Komarno, Baranya, Veszprim, Abauj-Torna, Liptov etc.. In addition, one gains granite,
gneiss, porphyry, basalt, sandstone and limestone, chalk, gypsum, talc, Serpentine, asbestos,
and Walker earth. Brown coals are found in numerous and powerful camps mainly in the combustion
mountain near Sopron, coal at five churches in Anina-Steierdorf, Szekul and Reschitza in Krasso
Szörényer-county, in Schylthal, etc. in the Transylvania most productive salt mines are Szlatina,
Rónaszek and Sugatag in Marmaros and to Deésakna, Torda, Parajd, Maros and Ujvár Vizakna in
Transylvania. In Sóvár only Sudsalz generated. The salt production, which is operated as a state
monopoly in U. amounted 1887 1,598,983 metric. Cwt saltpetre and potash are found in many places
in their natural state, mostly between the Tisza and the Berettyó. Alum is generated at the Nuczaly
Bereg County. In peat swamp areas, especially in Hanság, but engraved in the Zips. Mountain
oil there is in the Marmaros, in the county of Bihar, in Transylvania, Croatia, etc., but only
in small quantities. Bernstein found on the Magura in the Zips. The production of the mines and huts
in the countries of the Hungarian crown was in 1887:

Brown coal. 17234396 "" 4998150 "

to antimony, nickel and cobalt, lead oxide in low proportions. The total value of mining products
Hungary in 1887 represented a value of 21 million Guld., That of the salt production of 14
Guld million. Mineral Springs is one in U. of 900, including famous
thermal baths and mineral waters; should be pointed out under "Carpathians"
(P. 558) already mentioned resorts nor the Sulfur sources in Harkány
(Baranya county), Tapolcza (Zala), Toeplitz (Croatia), Warasdin, Spas
in the Krapina (Croatia) and the iodine sources in Lippik (Slavonia).
The industry in Hungary covers at all superfluity of commodities not
domestic demand, because the Gewerbthätigkeit formerly mostly limited
to the ordinary needs of life and the factory system is only recently
enjoyed an upswing. Many work in metals iron and steel hammers, Iron
foundries (Budapest, Krompach, Rhonitz, Salgo-Tarjan, Munkács, Anina-Steierdorf,
Resitza and Dernö), sheet metal and wire works, fittings factories,
etc.; the best steel supplies Diós Györ (Borsod County).
No; I was looking for the Knitting Swede's.

Knitting Swede Olson!  Remember him, Briggs?  A fine hole for a young fool to seek!  But I
was a man, remember--a MAN--and that precious discharge proved it.  I was nineteen years old,
and manhood bears a very serious aspect at nineteen.  No wonder I was holding my head in the
air.  The fellows in my watch would listen to my opinions with respect, now I was an able seaman.
No longer would I scrub the foc'sle floor while the lazy beggars slept.  No longer would I
peggy week in and week out.  I was A.B. at last; a full-fledged man!  Of course, I must straightway
prove my manhood; so I was bound for the Knitting Swede's.

Everybody knew the Knitting Swede in those days; every man Jack who ever joined a ship.  They
told of him in New York, and London, and Callao, and Singapore, and in every foc'sle afloat.
The king of crimps!  He sat in his barroom, in East street, placidly knitting socks with four
steel needles, and as placidly ignoring every law of God and man.  He ruled the 'Frisco waterfront,
did the Knitting Swede, and made his power felt to the very ends of the seas.

Stories about him were without number.  It was the Knitting Swede who shanghaied the corpse
on board the Tam o' Shanter.  It was the Knitting Swede who drugged the skipper of the Sequoia,
and shipped him in his own foc'sle.  It was the Knitting Swede who sent the crowd of cowboys
to sea in the Enterprise.  It was the Knitting Swede who was the infamous hero of quite half
the dog-watch yarns.  It was the Knitting Swede who was--oh, the very devil!

And it was on this very account I was bound for the Swede's house. Very simple, and sailorlike,
my motive.  In my mind's eye I saw a scene which would be enacted on board my next ship. High tariffs for U. had only serve a purpose if there is an own customs territory could
form and thus protect its own industry. The trade policy of Austria-Hungary increases the cost
of the latter, those brands, which it imports, and restricts the export of its Crude products.
Therefore, seek U. is also in an economic relationship in terms of the to liberate trade, transport
and credit of Austria and in particular the development are the industries in recent years through
construction of new educational institutions, museums, Trade schools and training workshops as
well as granting of exemptions and other to promote public benefit sought.
  He possessed a mop of straw-colored
hair, and a pair of little, mild, blue eyes that regarded one with all the innocence of a babe's
stare. One gets you time and drive, the second play,
which granted the natural scenery and the audience to consider, in greater detail. Thousands
of spectators, over whose heads you look sitting here more or less under open sky, looking all
happy and excited, but also subjected to physical needs. not even silent before the picture of the
Most High and Holy to talk to Homer, "the rage the tiresome stomach. " Powerful bread debris
come to light, slender Butterbemmchen disappear next to uncounted Knack sausages and bacon
flowering. You hear jump bud and chuckle a discharging bottles. In between sobs and moans and the
prosaic Aftermath of weeping - the vacuum.

Unless, of course, men were exceptionally scarce, and blood money exceptionally high.  Crimpdom
honor wouldn't stand much temptation.  But I was confident of my ability to look after myself.
I was a man of nineteen, you know.

So, at the Knitting Swede's I was lodged.  I spent most of my first day there in examining
and getting acquainted with my fellow lodgers. forest stands (especially in N. Spruce and fir are also common among
E. Paper, in the lowlands only acacias, poplars, oaks and small trees gods, S. preferably oak and beech)
are usually Ã¤rarische or property of the lords and cities.
  I bought them drinks at the Swede's bar, and listened with immense satisfaction
to their loud comments on my generosity.  It was, "He's a fine lad, and no mistake!" and, "He's
a real proper bloke, for certain!"  And I ordered up the rounds, and swung my shoulders, and
felt like a "real proper bloke" indeed.

Well, I saw one chap in the house who really attracted me. The size, manliness has a cleansing effect just as the sea never
appear dirty. Then there is the presence of the wild, the every petty thoughts from your soul
essence. I see the sky above me with its eternal Light, a passing cloud discharges in lightning
and thunder, and then we flash of the slopes towards the meadows, and further up waving the green
forest. Here stroll cheerful Prostitutes, a farmer's right there in the hay together, you can hear
the roosters crowing and cooing of the Pigeons.
or size which drew me to him; it was his bearing.
