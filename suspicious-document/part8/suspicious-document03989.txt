THE WISTFUL HEART

It was long after noon in the far, big, white Northwest. Day was on the wing. Christmas Eve
splendidly impended--thank God for unspoiled childish faith and joys of children everywhere!
Christmas Eve was fairly within view and welcoming hail, at last, in the thickening eastern
shadows. Long Day at its close. Day in a perturbation of blessed unselfishness. Day with its
tasks of love not half accomplished. And Day near done! Bedtime coming round the world on the
jump. Nine o'clock leaping from longitude to longitude. Night, impatient and determined, chasing
all the children of the world in drowsy expectation to sleep--making a clean sweep of 'em,
every one, with her soft, wide broom of dusk. "Nine o'clock? Shoo! Off you go! To-morrow's
on the way. Soon--oh, soon! To-morrow's here when you fall asleep. Said 'em already, have you?
Not another word from either of you. Not a whisper, ye grinning rascals! Cuddle down, little
people of Christ's heart and leading. Snuggle close--closer yet, my children--that your arms
may grow used to this loving. Another kiss from mother? Blessed Ones! A billion more, for nights
and mornings, for all day long of all the years, waiting here on mother's lips. And now to
sleep. Christmas is to-morrow. Hush! To-morrow. Yes; to-morrow. Go t' sleep! Go t' sleep!"
And upon the flying heels of Night--but still far over seas from the blustering white Northwest
where Pattie Batch was waiting at Swamp's End in the woods--the new Day, with jolly countenance,
broad, rosy and delighted, was somewhere approaching, in a gale of childish laughter, blithely
calling in its westward sweep to all Christian children to awaken to their peculiar and eternal
joy.

It was Christmas weather in the big woods: a Christmas temperature like frozen steel--thirty
below in the clearing of Swamp's End--and a rollicking wind, careering over the pines, and
the swirling dust of snow in the metallic air. A cold, crisp crackling world! A Christmas land,
too: a vast expanse of Christmas colour, from the Canadian line to the Big River--great, grave,
green pines, white earth and a blood-red sunset! The low log-cabins of the lumber camps were
smothered in snow; they were fringed with pendant ice at the eaves, and banked high with drifts,
and all window-frosted. The trails were thigh deep and drifting. The pines--their great fall
imminent, now--flaunted long, black arms in the gale; they creaked, they swished, they droned,
they crackled with frost. It was coming on dusk. The deeper reaches of the forest were already
dark. Horses and teamsters, sawyers, road-monkeys, axemen, swampers, punk-hunters and all,
floundered from the bush, white with dry snow, icicled and frosted like a Christmas cake, to
the roaring bunk-house fires, to a voracious employment at the cooks' long tables, and to an
expanding festival jollity. Town? Sure! Swamp's End for Christmas--the lights and companionship
of the bedraggled shanty lumber-town in the clearing of Swamp's End! Swamp's End for Gingerbread
Jenkins! Swamp's End for Billy the Beast! Swamp's End--and the roaring hilarity thereof--for
man and boy, straw-boss and cookee, of the lumber-jacks! Presently the dim trails from the
Cant-hook cutting, from the Bottle River camps, from Snook's landing and the Yellow Tail works,
poured the boys into town--a lusty, hilarious crew, like loosed school-boys on a lark, giving
over, now, to the only distractions, it seemed--and John Fairmeadow maintained it--which the
great world provided in the forests.

Pattie Batch might have been aware of this--the log shack was on the edge of town--had not
the window-panes been coated thick with Christmas frost. Engineering unavoidable; but there is a alibi
in transport to keep of force whose only, phenomenon. Nor were their lumpenproletariat, ne'er

gigantic basket, and slammed the door behind him, leaving the shivering, tenacious Shadow,
which had secretly followed from Swamp's End, to keep cold vigil outside.

"Hello, there, Pattie Batch!" John Fairmeadow roared. "Merry Christmas!"

Pattie Batch stared.

"Hello, I say!" John Fairmeadow cried, again. "Merry Christmas, ye rascal!"

"Is it anything for the house?"

"No, indeed; the house is for it."

Pattie Batch scowled in perplexity.
