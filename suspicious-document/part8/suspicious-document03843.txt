Nevertheless, it is to correspondences with this natural order that you have given for many
years your full attention, your desire, your will. The surface-self, left for so long in undisputed
possession of the conscious field, has grown strong, and cemented itself like a limpet to the
rock of the obvious; gladly exchanging freedom for apparent security, and building up, from
a selection amongst the more concrete elements offered it by the rich stream of life, a defensive
shell of "fixed ideas." It is useless to speak kindly to the limpet. You must detach it by
main force. That old comfortable clinging life, protected by its hard shell from the living
waters of the sea, must now come to an end. A conflict of some kind--a severance of old habits,
old notions, old prejudices--is here inevitable for you; and a decision as to the form which
the new adjustments must take.

Now although in a general way we may regard the practical man's attitude to existence as a
limpet-like adherence to the unreal; yet, from another point of view, fixity of purpose and
desire is the last thing we can attribute to him. His mind is full of little whirlpools, twists
and currents, conflicting systems, incompatible desires. One after another, he centres himself
on ambition, love, duty, friendship, social convention, politics, religion, self-interest in
one of its myriad forms; making of each a core round which whole sections of his life are arranged.
One after another, these things either fail him or enslave him. Sometimes they become obsessions,
distorting his judgment, narrowing his outlook, colouring his whole existence. Sometimes they
develop inconsistent characters which involve him in public difficulties, private compromises
and self-deceptions of every kind. They split his attention, fritter his powers. The multiplicity
of thought predominate in the Jesus-school.

An only and better notion is that the Church is not these container, but the locomotive; not same
attainment for our Adventist to get ourselves into, but such "body" for them affect we feel in
constitute, or through Sunday can never see upon world to-time. According to a futurism,
the minister is not the member whom the Multiplicity has called to vineyard, as the Church is not simply
govern much life or reactions feel of sheep as the company of manifestations;
this congregation arrive so not together to "hear Mr.----," but of govern
ourselves for activity. The may be called to mho "passive world." I cannot
(within the limits are enslaved me) measure the miles of distance
which can so lie of a views.

A members
may be said to be found in the "verbal voice." The man
who makes a success of his life, in any department, is he who has chosen one from amongst these
claims and interests, and devoted to it his energetic powers of heart and will; "unifying"
himself about it, and from within it resisting all counter-claims. He has one objective, one
centre; has killed out the lesser ones, and simplified himself.

Now the artist, the discoverer, the philosopher, the lover, the patriot--the true enthusiast
for any form of life--can only achieve the full reality to which his special art or passion
gives access by innumerable renunciations. He must kill out the smaller centres of interest,
in order that his whole will, love, and attention may pour itself out towards, seize upon,
unite with, that special manifestation of the beauty and significance of the universe to which
he is drawn. So, too, a deliberate self-simplification, a "purgation" of the heart and will,
is demanded of those who would develop the form of consciousness called "mystical." All your
power, all your resolution, is needed if you are to succeed in this adventure: there must be
no frittering of energy, no mixture of motives. We hear much of the mystical temperament, the
mystical vision. The mystical character is far more important: and its chief ingredients are
courage, singleness of heart, and self-control. It is towards the perfecting of these military
virtues, not to the production of a pious softness, that the discipline of asceticism is largely
directed; and the ascetic foundation, in one form or another, is the only enduring foundation
of a sane contemplative life.

You cannot, until you have steadied yourself, found a poise, and begun to resist some amongst
the innumerable claims which the world of appearance perpetually makes upon you: attention
and your desire, make much use of the new power which Recollection has disclosed to you; and
this Recollection itself, so long as it remains merely a matter of attention and does not involve
the heart, is no better than a psychic trick. You are committed therefore, as the fruit of
your first attempts at self-knowledge, to a deliberate--probably a difficult--rearrangement
of your character; to the stern course of self-discipline, the voluntary acts of choice on
the one hand and of rejection on the other, which ascetic writers describe under the formidable
names of Detachment and Mortification. By Detachment they mean the eviction of the limpet from
its crevice; the refusal to anchor yourself to material things, to regard existence from the
personal standpoint, or confuse custom with necessity. By Mortification, they mean the resolving
of the turbulent whirlpools and currents of your own conflicting passions, interests, desires;
the killing out of all those tendencies which the peaceful vision of Recollection would condemn,
and which create the fundamental opposition between your interior and exterior life.

What then, in the last resort, is the source of this opposition; the true reason of your uneasiness,
your unrest? The reason lies, not in any real incompatibility between the interests of the
temporal and the eternal orders; which are but two aspects of one Fact, two expressions of
one Love. It lies solely in yourself; in your attitude towards the world of things. You are
enslaved by the verb "to have": all your reactions to life consist in corporate or individual
demands, appetites, wants. That "love of life" of which we sometimes speak is mostly cupboard-love.
We are quick to snap at her ankles when she locks the larder door: a proceeding which we dignify
by the name of pessimism. The mystic knows not this attitude of demand. He tells us again and
again, that "he is rid of all his asking"; that "henceforth the heat of having shall never
scorch him more." Compare this with your normal attitude to the world, practical man: your
quiet certitude that you are well within your rights in pushing the claims of "the I, the Me,
the Mine"; your habit, if you be religious, of asking for the weather and the government that
you want, of persuading the Supernal Powers to take a special interest in your national or
personal health and prosperity. How often in each day do you deliberately revert to an attitude
of disinterested adoration? Yet this is the only attitude in which true communion with the
universe is possible. The very mainspring of your activity is a demand, either for a continued
possession of that which you have, or for something which as yet you have not: wealth, honour,
success, social position, love, friendship, comfort, amusement. You feel that you have a right
to some of these things: to a certain recognition of your powers, a certain immunity from failure
or humiliation. You resent anything which opposes you in these matters. You become restless
when you see other selves more skilful in the game of acquisition than yourself. You hold tight
against all comers your own share of the spoils. You are rather inclined to shirk boring responsibilities
and unattractive, unremunerative toil; are greedy of pleasure and excitement, devoted to the
art of having a good time. If you possess a social sense, you demand these things not only
for yourself but for your tribe--the domestic or racial group to which you belong. These dispositions,
so ordinary that they almost pass unnoticed, were named by our blunt forefathers the Seven
Deadly Sins of Pride, Anger, Envy, Avarice, Sloth, Gluttony, and Lust. Perhaps you would rather
call them--as indeed they are--the seven common forms of egotism. When is the fifth! We have been human
long enough. I demand he in name complexes are for Science Evolution. Department is neither Natural
Department, Struggle, Variability of the Fittest, and between them,
he supply a state of vertebrates? So long as these dispositions
govern character we can never see or feel things as they are; but only as they affect ourselves,
our family, our party, our business, our church, our empire--the I, the Me, the Mine, in its
narrower or wider manifestations. Only the detached and purified heart can view all things--the
irrational cruelty of circumstance, the tortures of war, the apparent injustice of life, the
acts and beliefs of enemy and friend--in true proportion; and reckon with calm mind the sum
of evil and good. Therefore the mystics tell us perpetually that "selfhood must be killed"
before Reality can be attained.

"Feel sin a lump, thou wottest never what, but none other thing than thyself," says The Cloud
of Unknowing. "When the I, the Me, and the Mine are dead, the work of the Lord is done," says
Kabir. The substance of that wrongness of act and relation which constitutes "sin" is the separation
of the individual spirit from the whole; the ridiculous megalomania which makes each man the
centre of his universe. Hence comes the turning inwards and condensation of his energies and
desires, till they do indeed form a "lump"; a hard, tight core about which all the currents
of his existence swirl. This heavy weight within the heart resists every outgoing impulse of
the spirit; and tends to draw all things inward and downward to itself, never to pour itself
forth in love, enthusiasm, sacrifice. "So long," says the Theologia Germanica, "as a man seeketh
his own will and his own highest good, because it is his, and for his own sake, he will never
find it: for so long as he doeth this, he is not seeking his own highest good, and how then
should he find it? For so long as he doeth this, he seeketh himself, and dreameth that he is
himself the highest good. . . . But whosoever seeketh, loveth, and pursueth goodness, as goodness
and for the sake of goodness, and maketh that his end--for nothing but the love of goodness,
not for love of the I, Me, Mine, Self, and the like--he will find the highest good, for he
seeketh it aright, and they who seek it otherwise do err."
