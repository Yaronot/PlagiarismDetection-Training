The journey was thus, throughout the whole route, a perpetual fete; and at Lyons it amounted
to an ovation, in which the whole town turned out to meet him.  He entered, surrounded by an

  The night of the 2d of July, he alighted
at the Tuileries; and the next day, as soon as the news of his return had been circulated in
Paris, the entire population filled the courts and the garden.  They pressed around the windows
of the pavilion of Flora, in the hope of catching a glimpse of the savior of France, the liberator
of Italy.

That evening there was no one, either rich or poor, who did not take delight in illuminating
his house or his garret.  It was only a short time after his arrival at Paris that the First
Consul learned of the death of General Kleber.  The poniard of Suleyman had slain this great
captain the same day that the cannon of Marengo laid low another hero of the army of Egypt.
This assassination caused the First Consul the most poignant grief, of which I was an eyewitness,
and to which I can testify; and, nevertheless, his calumniators have dared to say that he rejoiced
at an event, which, even considered apart from its political relations, caused him to lose
a conquest which had cost him so much, and France so much blood and expense. 

And that used to be the place of exile in Portugal, as well as the capital was still called Desterro,
here were the criminals, especially many Jews transported as punishment for past misdeeds, or perhaps
even to create uncomfortable personalities out of the way - a very light and by some state funds
are often applied. But time is over, and now hear how the residents do not even like to see
more that the place was once used for such purposes, Santa Catharina is currently the key to many excellent
Brazilian-German colonies grown, and a large number of Germans are even stayed there and have settled as businessmen
or artisans in the capital. Desterro is almost half a German town.

GÃ¼nther von Schwartzau knew the place, but despite his eye dwelt with
delight on the truly wonderful picture that stretched before him as
they drove around to the actual port from the northern winds protective
headland and now the small, friendly town, terraces of trees, bushes
and palm trees enclosed in front of them saw.

Magnificent building handcuffed but not the look or gave the port an air of splendor and wealth,
as is, for example, in Rio de Janeiro in the case, but so secluded and hidden each apartment
was in the soft green of the gardens, so quiet splashed to the sea and thus clouds was stretched inside
the blue sky over it, that one felt as well, before entering the
foot is only the country.

As the anchor of course, shot in the depth of the peace was disturbed on board. The Flag Telegraph
had reported the arrival of a steamer from the north, already, and a number of boats and those
excellently crafted canoes - the one in the whole world is not built by graceful and practical,
as in Brazil - had long since.

The boat people conceived but, as in other places, here too, without ceremony, what they found in luggage
to make it to their small vehicles and to secure the respective passengers.

GÃ¼nther
course immediately went ashore with, for staying on this small Brazilian steamers is not pleasant enough
to the passengers for longer than is absolutely necessary to tie it, and then went in front of
the tabernacle of the President, where he is at least wanted to sign. He had hardly taken time to
make only the most necessary toilet, but the evenings are in all those
countries at all the time in which to make visits or receiving.

The German found themselves in today exceptionally large company assembled, and listened as the President
is his name, they could ask him to enter immediately. But he came from Santa Clara, and she took
herself the greatest interest to hear more of this colony and the
new.

GÃ¼nther was led into the large reception room and found there six or eight men gathered and just
as many women.

The President himself was sitting in an armchair a little aside, it
was a little elderly gentleman, with an infinitely good-natured face
and a pair of large, intelligent eyes, but he seemed very ill. He looked
pale and attacked, with sunken cheeks and their own painful part to the
finely-cut mouth.

"Ah, my dear Eswartsau [2]," he nodded kindly and held out her thin, almost transparent hand, "already
done in Santa Clara? It's gone quickly.

"[Footnote 2: Portuguese and Spaniards can never be a Sp, Sch St or
with a consonant behind it say at the beginning of a word, and set
before each time an email.]"

Not yet, sir, "said Gunther, Taking his hand
warmly and oppressive - "I must return again and tell you later why
I have come across -. Senhora allow you for allowing me to welcome
you"

"We are very pleased," said the lady with a gracious smile , "you

   Jerome Bonaparte,
then hardly seventeen years of age, was introduced.  This young man gave his family frequent
cause of complaint, and feared no one except his brother Napoleon, who reprimanded, lectured,
and scolded him as if he had been his own son.  There was a question at the time of making
him a sailor, less with the object of giving him a career, than of removing him from the seductive
temptations which the high position of his brother caused to spring up incessantly around his
path, and which he had little strength to resist.  It may be imagined what it cost him to renounce
pleasures so accessible and so delightful to a young man. Some leaves are belong to you, still well preserved in Jena, when
I come across to these are returned.

In my essay, which I define the second piece of the Propylaea, I can with our good Unger Being
not think same thing, but at last is probably still find a Conciliation . Let The trouble is
that the British, in their new style, by a much lighter mechanical treatment type, do much in
certain parts more than the Germans, after the old way, ever be able to pull off. Both these
types of treatments against each other is set a task for the future,
this time we have spoken only of the effects.

Farewell, since you have so necessary to your health and happiness
employments.

Today I'm coming back to you to ask for the Castle of Otranto = =. Some women, who have not
read it yet, I would like to introduce into this miracle.

Dabey I send the first sheet of the Propylaea, you might not mind a little early I read and
pleasing to return again soon.

Professor Meyer greets. He has spent the recension of Fiorillo with
care. He leaves the literary merits of this brave man's back full
justice, and meet in the principal points in total agreement with
him. Where he differs reviewer's motive Causes very clear, so this
ad is very instructive.

Mr. Unger is right that there are already
in the early traces of the woodcuts Type that have lifted the English
now so high and the more strange it is that you so far has made no
use, and that the British honor of the re-discovery and culture makes
this island verlohrnen honor is undeniable.  He had discovered, on his return, one of Madame Bonaparte's
women, lying in wait, and who had seen him through the window of a closet opening upon the
corridor.  The First Consul, after a vigorous outburst against the curiosity of the fair sex,
sent me to the young scout from the enemy's camp to intimate to her his orders to hold her
tongue, unless she wished to be discharged without hope of return. I do not know whether I
added a milder argument to these threats to buy her silence; but, whether from fear or for
compensation, she had the good sense not to talk.  Nevertheless, the successful lover, fearing
another surprise, directed me to rent in the Allee des Ireuves a little house where he and
Madame D. met from time to time.  Such were, and continued to be, the precautions of the First
Consul towards his wife.  He had the highest regard for her, and took all imaginable care to
prevent his infidelities coming to her knowledge.  Besides, these passing fancies did not lessen
the tenderness he felt for her; and although other women inspired him with love, no other woman
had his confidence and friendship to the same extent as Madame Bonaparte.  There have been
a thousand and one calumnies repeated of the harshness and brutality of the First Consul towards
women.  He was not always gallant, but I have never seen him rude; and, however singular it
may seem after what I have just related, he professed the greatest veneration for a wife of
exemplary conduct, speaking in admiring terms of happy households; and he did not admire cynicism,
either in morals or in language. The most pleasant Expectation
I therefore look forward to your contribution. Nothing has yet been started at the pressure
and is probably a month ago not to do this because writing on paper are expected.

You have given me with your poem with great pleasure that the subject
is a noble Dignity and a philosophical impetus treated, language and
verse are excellent.

Some To the ancient syllabic with such a substance related to modern. That you can very satisfactory
answer, that the philosophical treatment of the same substance in themselves already moved out of his
primitive world in a modern raison alternating end age. For your Treatment would have sent the hexameter
is not quite as it absolutely a actual and allegorical embodiment of the idea would gefodert,
and I think, therefore, that you feel you have managed quite right.

However, I wish this very symbolic and allegorical treatment for that one have done less than
reminiscent of the old Prometheus would. This steals the real and natural fires, and with this
he makes man a gift, and the fire of the Actus robbery could therefore be sensualizes of the
old poet, with its cumbersome, but because bey your treatment of the symbolic mind is equal aufgefodert,
the natural fire to leave and take in a supernatural significance, it is the imagination of
the reader by those descriptions into the crowd, apply to the fire
as a fire.

I would advise that account on this delicate point is as quiet as possible to go away. Nor would
It seems to me, do a better effect if the fire is not the car itself, but take about a torch left,
because the imagination far more with a burning torch can associate
with as a light-emitting vehicles, the idea of ​​the spirit's fire,
and at all the fire is so precious and noble, the simpler and more
economical is its source.

Still would be my advice to the reader right on the front lines of
the poem in the right position back and to prevent any misinterpretation
that the poem: An Allegory overwrite = =, because it is in the strictest
sense, and the judge must have this concept in mind.

                                                    

Since you have not overwritten, so I put it here bey, but please, I soon again returned, as
was I, the other thing that you have determined for the Almanac have expected with the request.

The symbolic use of fire involving you in a difficulty, which I hardly

It was, in fact, the delay of an instant which saved her life, as well as that of her daughter,
her sister-in-law, Madame Murat, and all who were to accompany them, since the carriage of
these ladies, instead of being immediately behind that of the First Consul, was just leaving
the Place Carrousel, when the machine exploded.  The glass was shivered; and though Madame
Bonaparte received no injury except the terrible fright, Hortense was slightly wounded in the
face by a piece of glass, and Madame Caroline Murat, who was then far advanced in pregnancy,
was so frightened that it was necessary to carry her back to the Tuileries.  This catastrophe
had its influence, even on the health of her child; for I have been told that Prince Achille
Muratz is subject, to this day, to frequent attacks of epilepsy. May 1,801th Because of my new piece I did in Berlin has done a step,

the general voice, it is the main role of the vows would take over, is subject have no doubt.
Insure your added to my taking, that I am very pleased at their personal acquaintance and that
the prospect of seeing their beautiful representations of my desire to visit Berlin no small

fall to her. It is Agnes Sorel, the Johanna indeed very subordinate but still important and grateful for
the representation. I look forward to the appearance of your almanac

earnest desire is to give you the part which you were kind enough to take mine to reciprocate

  Some accused the Jacobins of this, because
three months before they had placed the poniard in the hands of Cerrachi, of Arena, and of
Topino Lebrun; whilst others, less numerous perhaps, thought the aristocrats, the Royalists,
could alone be guilty of this atrocity.  I could give no time to these various accusations,
except as I was detained in forcing my way through an immense and closely packed crowd, and
as rapidly as possible went on, and in two seconds was at the Carrousel.  I threw myself against
the wicket, but the two sentinels instantly crossed bayonets before my breast. 

                   Her sweet and tender poem pleasantly surprised me, and reminded me
of a similar work by Mr. G. I would quite like to meet him.

For the last several weeks I've been struggling with the terrible
heat, and now this congestion.

  On entering the vestibule he said to his officers, rubbing
his hands, "Well, sirs, we made a fine escape!  "They shuddered with indignation and anger.
He then entered the grand saloon on the ground floor, where a large number of counselors of
state and-dignitaries had already assembled; but hardly had they begun to express their congratulations,
when he interrupted them, and in so vehement a manner that he was heard outside the saloon. The venerable bishop himself, who just coincidentally
was on one of his haciendas in the province, the marriage has closed. Dom Franklin is his

"I did, however," replied M. de Schwartzau, "but after just heard

"And what was it?"
"I wanted to ask you, sir, your decision to change the Directory
of the colony, nor not run until at least not more inquiries about

But such was the devotion of each and all to the person of the First Consul, such was the affection
that he so well knew how to inspire in those around him, that not one of the persons attached
to his service was for an instant suspected of having a hand in this infamous attempt.
