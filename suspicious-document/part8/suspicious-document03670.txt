(19:96) Although, after the death of Moses, no one held absolute sway, yet the power of deciding
both in matters spiritual and matters temporal was in the hands of the secular chief, as I
have already pointed out. (97) Further, in order that it might be taught religion and piety,
the people was bound to consult the supreme judge no less than the high priest (Deut. xvii:9,

whom he chose the chiefs), so that each in rotation, at the allotted time, might perform the
sacred rites. (101) The priests he also divided into as many companies; I will not go through

and they will always retain it, if they will refuse to allow religious dogmas to be unduly
multiplied or confounded with philosophy. He made her eat in the thousand were so. They were both
