This odyle is particularly potent in certain bodies and one of these is the beryl or quartz.
It produces and retains more readily in the beryl than in most other bodies the images communicated
to it by the subconscious activity of the seer. It is in the nature of a sensitized film which
is capable of recording thought forms and mental images as the photographic film records objective
things. The occultist will probably recognize in it many of the properties of the "astral light,"
which is often spoken of in this connection. Readers of my Manual of Occultism will already
be informed concerning the nature of subconscious activity. The mind or soul of man has two
aspects: the attentive or waking consciousness, directed to the things of the external world;
and the subconscious, which is concerned with the things of the interior world. Each of these
spheres of the mind has its voluntary and automatic phases, a fact which is usually lost sight
of, inasmuch as the automatism of the mind is frequently confounded with the subconscious.
All purposive action tends to become automatic, whether it be physical or mental, sensory or
psychic.

The soul in this connection is to be regarded as the repository of all that complex of emotions,
thoughts, aspirations, impressions, perceptions, feelings, etc., which constitute the inner
life of man. The soul is none the less a fact because there are those who bandy words about
its origin and nature.

Reichenbach has shown by a series of experiments upon sensitive and hypnotized subjects, that
metals and other materials produce very marked effects in contact with the human body. The
experiments further showed that the same substance affected different patients in diverse manners.

The hypnotic experiments of the late Dr. Charcot, the well-known French biologist, also demonstrate
the rapport existing between the sensitive subject and foreign bodies in proximity. A bottle
containing a poison is taken at random from a number of others of similar appearance and is
applied to the back of the patient's neck. The hypnotic subject at once begins to develop all
the symptoms of arsenical, strychnine or prussic acid poisoning; it being afterwards found
that the bottle contains the toxine whose effects have been portrayed by the subject. But not
all hypnotic subjects are capable of the same degree of sensibility.

Community of sensation is as common a phenomenon as community of thought between a hypnotizer
and his subject, and what are called sympathetic pains are included in common experience. Sensitive
persons will simulate all the symptoms of a virulent disease, e.g. mock measles. We are ne'er, my Lieutenant

In Boehme's case, as in that of Swedenborg, whose faculty did not appear until he was fifty-four
years of age, it would appear that the faculty was constitutional and already developed, waiting
only the conditions which should bring it into active operation.

The agent most suitable for developing clairvoyance cannot therefore be definitely prescribed.
It must remain a matter of experiment with the subject himself. That there are some persons
in whom the psychic faculties are more prone to activity than in others is certain, and it
would appear also that these faculties are native in some by spiritual or hereditary succession,
which fact is evident from their genitures as interpreted by astrology. Many planets in flexed
signs and a satellitium in the nadir or lower angle of the horoscope is a certain indication
of extreme nervous sensibility and predisposition to telaesthenic impressions, though this
observation does not cover all the instances before me. It is true, however, where it applies.
The dominant influence of the planet Neptune in a horoscope is also to be regarded as a special
indication of some form of psychic activity, as I have frequently observed.

In cases where the subject is not prepared by evolutional process for the exercise of the psychic
faculties, it will be found that the same or similar indications will tend to the simulation
of such faculties, as by mediumism, conjuring, etc., while they may even result in chicanery
and fraud.

But among those who are gifted in the direction spoken of, all are not clairvoyant. The most
common form of psychic disturbance is involuntary clairaudience, and telaesthesia is not perhaps
less general. St. Paul indicates a variety of such psychic "gifts," e.g. the gifts of prophecy,
of healing, of understanding, etc.; but these may also be regarded in quite a mundane sense.
The development among the early Christians of spiritual gifts, visions, hearing, speaking in
foreign tongues, psychic healing, etc., appears to have given rise to a variety of exceptional
experiences by which they were induced to say "we cannot but speak the things we have seen
and heard." "One star differs from another in glory," says St. Paul, and this diversity of
spiritual gifts proceeds from the celestial world, and is so ordered that each may fulfil the
part required of him in the economy of life.

Psychic tradition is as important a fact as is physical heredity. The latter is a factor of
immense importance as affecting the constitution and quality of the organism in and through
which the soul is required to function. But psychic tradition is that which determines the
power and faculty brought to bear upon the physical organism. Past evolution is not a negligible
quantity, and its effects are never wasted or lost to the individual. We are what we are by
reason of what we have already been, as well individually as racially. "The future is, the
past unfolded" or "entered upon by a new door," as it has been well said. We do not suddenly
acquire faculties, we evolve them by effort and successive selection. In our upward striving
for liberty we specialize along certain lines which appear to us to be those offering either
the least resistance or the most ready means of self-preservation, liberty and well-being.
Hence some evolve a special faculty for money-making and, as schoolboys, will be expert traders
of alley-taws, jack-knives, toffee and all sorts of kickshaws. Others of another bent or list
will traffic in knowledge to the abounding satisfaction of their masters and the jealous pride
of their form.

So that psychic tradition while disposing some to the speedy revelation of an already acquired
faculty, disposes others to the more arduous but not less interesting work of acquiring such
faculty. And because the spiritual needs of mankind are ever of primary importance, there are
always to be found those in whom the power of spiritual interpretation is the dominant faculty,
such persons being the natural channels of intercourse between the superior and inferior worlds.
The physical body of man is equipped with a corresponding order of microbic life which acts
as an organic interpreter, translating the elements of food into blood, nerve, fibre, tissue
and bone agreeably to the laws of their being. What I have to say in this place is addressed
especially to those who would aspire to the faculty of clear vision and in whom the psychic
powers are striving towards expression. Every person whose life is not wholly sunk in material
and selfish pleasures but in whom the aspiration to a higher and better life is a hunger the
world cannot satisfy, has within himself the power to see and know that which he seeks behind
the veil of the senses. Nature has never produced a desire she cannot satisfy. There is no
hope, however vague, that the soul cannot define, and no aspiration, however high, that the
wings of the spirit cannot reach. Therefore be patient and strive. To others I would say: Be
content. All birds cannot be eagles. The nightingale has a song and the humming bird a plumage
the eagle can never possess. The nightingale may sing to the stars, the humming bird to the
flowers, but the eagle, whose tireless eyes gaze into the heart of day, is uncompanioned in
its lofty loneliness amid the mountain tops.

CHAPTER III.

THE FACULTY OF SEERSHIP

Until quite recently the faculty of seership has been associated in occult literature with
various magical formulae. There are in existence works by Tristemius, Francis Barrett, Ebenezer
Sibley and others in which the use of the crystal is made by means of magical invocations and
a variety of ceremonial observances. It is not within the scope of this treatise to determine
the value of such rites or the desirability of invoking extraneous intelligences and powers
by the use of magical practices; but I think we may conclude that communion of this order is
not unattended by grave dangers. When the Israelites were ill-content with the farinaceous
manna they invoked Heaven to send them meat. They got what they wanted, but also the dire penalty
which it incurred; and it is quite likely that in invoking occult forces beyond one's power
to control great evils may ensue. All action and reaction are equal and opposite. A child can
pull a trigger but cannot withstand the recoil of a gun, or by moving a lever may set machinery
in motion which it can by no means control. Therefore without strength and knowledge of the
right sort it is foolish to meddle with occult forces; and in the education of the development
of the psychic and spiritual faculties native in us, it is better to encourage their natural
development by legitimate exercise than to invoke the action of a stimulus which cannot afterwards
be controlled. Water will wear away a rock by continual fretting, though nobody doubts that
water is softer than a rock, and if the barrier between this and the soul-world be like granite,
yet the patient and persistent action of the determined mind will sooner or later wear it away,
the last thin layer will break and the light of another world will stream through, dazzling
our unaccustomed eyes with its bright effulgence.
