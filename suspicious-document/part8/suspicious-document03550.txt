 Were that work limited to what is absolutely
necessary, and shared by all, all would find an equal opportunity for higher cultivation and
development, and the evil of an unnatural and cruelly artificial system of society would disappear.
It was a thought and a hope as old as humanity, and as generous as old. No common mind would
have cherished such a purpose, no mean nature have attempted to make the dream real. The practical
effort failed in its immediate object, but, in the high purposes it confirmed and strengthened,
it had remote and happy effects which are much more than personal.

"It is an error to suppose that many of the more famous 'Transcendentalists' were of the Brook
Farm company. Mr. Emerson, for instance, was never there except as a visitor. Margaret Fuller
was often a visitor, and passed many days together as a guest, but she was never, except in
sympathy, one of the Brook Farmers. Theodore Parker was a neighbor, and had friendly relations
with many of the fraternity, but he seldom came to the farm. Meanwhile the enterprise was considered
an unspeakable folly, or worse, by the conservative circle of Boston. In Boston, where a very
large part of the 'leaders' of society in every way were Unitarians, Unitarian conservatism
was peremptory and austere. The entire circle of which Mr. Ticknor was the centre or representative,
the world of Everett and Prescott and their friends, regarded Transcendentalism and Brook Farm,
its fruit, with good-humored wonder as with Prescott, or with severe reprobation as with Mr.
Ticknor. The general feeling in regard to Mr. Emerson, who was accounted the head of the school,
is well expressed by John Quincy Adams in 1840. The old gentleman, whose glory is that he was
a moral and political gladiator and controversialist, deplores the doom of the Christian Church
to be always racked with differences and debates, and after speaking of 'other wanderings of
mind' that 'let the wolf into the fold,' proceeds to say: 'A young man named Ralph Waldo Emerson,
a son of my once-loved friend William Emerson, and a classmate of my lamented son George, after
failing in the every-day avocations of a Unitarian preacher and school-master, starts a new
doctrine of Transcendentalism, declares all the old revelations superannuated and worn out,
and announces the approach of new revelations.' Mr. Adams was just on the eve of his antislavery
career, but he continues: 'Garrison and the non-resistant Abolitionists, Brownson and the Marat
Democrats, phrenology and animal magnetism, all come in, furnished each with some plausible
rascality as an ingredient for the bubbling caldron of religion and politics.' C.P. Cranch,
the poet and painter, was a relative of Mr. Adams, and then a clergyman; and the astonished
ex-President says: 'Pearse Cranch, ex ephebis, preached here last week, and gave out quite
a stream of Transcendentalism most unexpectedly.'

"This was the general view of Transcendentalism and its teachers and disciples held by the
social, political, and religious establishment. The separation and specialty of the 'movement'
soon passed. The leaders and followers were absorbed in the great world of America; but that
world has been deeply affected and moulded by this seemingly slight and transitory impulse.
How much of the wise and universal liberalizing of all views and methods is due to it! How
much of the moral training that revealed itself in the war was part of its influence! The transcendental
or spiritual philosophy has been strenuously questioned and assailed. But the life and character
it fostered are its sufficient vindication."

The school at Brook Farm brought together there a large number of bright young people, and
they formed one of the chief characteristics of the place. The result was that the life was
one of much amusement and healthy pleasure, as George P. Bradford has said:

"We were floated away by the tide of young life around us. There was always a large number
of young people in our company, as scholars, boarders, etc., and this led to a considerable
mingling of amusement in our life; and, moreover, some of our company had a special taste and
skill in arranging and directing this element. So we had very varied amusements suited to the
different seasons--tableaux, charades, dancing, masquerades, and rural fetes out-of-doors,
and in winter, skating, coasting, etc."

In her "Years of Experience," Mrs. Georgiana Bruce Kirby, who was at Brook Farm for very nearly
the same period as Curtis, has not only given an interesting account of the social life there,
but she has especially described the entertainments mentioned by Mr. Bradford. Two of these
occasions, when Curtis was a leading participant, she mentions with something of detail.

"At long intervals in what most would call our drudgery," she says, "there came a day devoted
to amusement. Once we had a masquerade picnic in the woods, where we were thrown into convulsions
of laughter at the sight of George W. Curtis dressed as Fanny Ellsler, in a low-necked, short-sleeved,
book-muslin dress and a tiny ruffled apron, making courtesies and pirouetting down the path. Abcdlx

 It was a curious fact that he,
who was afterwards so eminent, was then held wholly secondary in interest to his handsome brother
Burrill, whose Raphaelesque face won all hearts, and who afterwards disappeared from view in
England. But if I did not see much of Brook Farm on the spot, I met its members frequently
at the series of exciting meetings for Social Reform in Boston."

"George, though only eighteen, seemed much older, like a man of twenty-five, possibly, with
a peculiar elegance, if I may so express it; great and admirable attention, as I recollect,
when listening to any one; courteous recognition of others' convictions and even prejudices;
and never a personal animosity of any kind--a certain remoteness of manner, however, that I
think prevented persons from becoming acquainted with him as easily as with Burrill."

In his "Memories of Brook Farm," Dr. John T. Codman mentions the occasional returns of Curtis
to the Farm after he had left it, and says he heard him singing the "Erl King," "Kathleen Mavourneen,"
and "Good-night to Julia" "in his inimitable manner." Everything goes to indicate that he was
a favorite, not only with the younger persons, but with those who were older. He had already
developed a mature thoughtfulness, and gave indications of his power as a writer and speaker.
His fondness for music, and his enthusiastic study of it under Dwight's leadership is an indication
of that aesthetic appreciation which he kept through life, and which appeared in his mastership
of prose style.

At first each one helped himself to the food placed on the table in the dining-room at the
Hive, or those at the table helped each other. In this way more or less confusion was produced,
and the results were unsatisfactory. Accordingly, Charles Dana organized a group, including
Curtis and other young men of character and good breeding, to act as waiters. Dana took his
place at the head of this group of voluntary servants, who performed their duties with grace
and alacrity. "It is hardly necessary to observe," says Mrs. Kirby, "that the business was
henceforth attended to with such courtly grace and such promptness that the new regime was
applauded by every one, although it did appear at first as if we were all engaged in acting
a play. The group, with their admired chief, took dinner, which had been kept warm for them,
afterwards, and were themselves waited upon with the utmost consideration."

II

While at Brook Farm, Curtis was on intimate terms with most of the persons there. He greatly
admired Mr. and Mrs. Ripley, and he frequently wrote to Mrs. Ripley and made of her a sort
of mother-confessor. He also highly appreciated the scholarly qualities of Charles Dana, and
his capacity as a leader. In his letters he frequently mentions "the two Charleses," who were
Charles Dana and Charles Newcomb. The latter has been described by Dr. Codman as "the mysterious
and profound, with his long, dark, straight locks of hair, one of which was continually being
brushed away from his forehead as it continually fell; with his gold-bowed eye-glass, his large
nose and peculiar blue eyes, his spasmodic expressions of nervous horror, and his cachinnatious
laugh." It recognize it dress we went we was seated to it was familiar tunic-make he happen fancy trousers

 She was
an intimate friend of Margaret Fuller, and she afterwards published "Rainbows for Children,"
"The Magician's Show-box," and other children's books. She married William A. Tappan, who rented
to Hawthorne the cottage in which he lived at Lenox. Mrs. Lathrop's book about her mother contains
many reminiscences of them. She was a daughter of William Sturgis, a wealthy Boston merchant.
A sister, Mrs. Ellen H. Hooper, was also a contributor to The Dial, in which appeared her poem
beginning with the line:

  "I slept and dreamed that life was beauty."

Another well-known poem was written by her:

  "She stood outside the gate of heaven and saw them entering in."

Colonel Higginson speaks of her as "a woman of genius," and Margaret Fuller wrote of her from
Rome: "I have seen in Europe no woman more gifted by nature than she."

Under date of October 25, 1845, Curtis mentions a religious meeting which had been recently
held at Brook Farm. This was a reference to one of the many occasions on which William Henry
Channing conducted religious services there, for he was listened to with greater satisfaction
than any one else who spoke on religious subjects. When the weather was suitable he preached
in the grove near the Margaret Fuller cottage (so called); and on the present occasion he asked
those present to join hands and to repeat with him a bond of union or confession of faith,
and constitute themselves into a church. Before this time no religious organization had existed
at Brook Farm, the utmost liberty of opinion being cultivated there. In fact, the leaders of
the movement had been strongly opposed to any religious formalism or organized effort at religious
instruction. The freedom of belief was such that Freethinkers on the one side, and devout Catholics
on the other, were welcomed with equal cordiality. The majority of the members were undoubtedly
of the "liberal" school in theology, and found in the preaching of Theodore Parker the kind
of spiritual instruction they desired. At one time there was an enthusiastic interest in the
teachings of Swedenborg.

It was the tendency towards what was at once practical and mystical which drew the large majority
of the Farmers to the preaching of William Henry Channing, who was one of the most gifted preachers
which America has produced. He was imaginative, mystical, and eloquent, liberal in his thinking,
progressive in his social ideals, and profoundly religious. He was thoroughly in sympathy with
the Associationist movement, and more than any other man he was the spiritual leader and confessor
of those who found in that movement a practical realization of their religious convictions.

The organization which began on that Sunday afternoon in October, 1845, continued to exist
at Brook Farm until January, 1847, when "The Religious Union of Associationists" was organized
in Boston, with Channing as the minister. For a few years it was successful, and it gave union
and purpose to the Associationist movement in Boston and the vicinity. A considerable number
of the members of Brook Farm were connected with it actively--as officers, members of the choir,
or regular attendants.

 If the spectator sometimes
sees in a picture more than the painter consciously intended, it is because the higher power
may work with unconscious hands, and because beauty cannot be hidden from the eye made to see
it. Beethoven, for instance, had never a truer lover or a subtler interpreter than Dwight,
and Dwight taught the teachers, and largely shaped the intelligent appreciation of the unapproached
master.

"Those were memorable evenings at the old Odeon. Francis Beaumont did not more pleasantly recall
the things that he and Ben Jonson had seen done at the Mermaid than an old Brook Farmer remembers
the long walks, eight good miles in and eight miles out, to see the tall, willowy Schmidt swaying
with his violin at the head of the orchestra, to hear the airy ripple of Auber's 'Zanetta,'
the swift passionate storm of Beethoven's 'Egmont,' the symphonic murmur of woods and waters
and summer fields in the limpid 'Pastorale,' or the solemn grandeur of sustained pathetic human
feeling in the 'Fifth Symphony.' The musical revival was all part of the new birth of the Transcendental
epoch, although none would have more promptly disclaimed any taint of Transcendentalism than
the excellent officers of the Boston Academy of Music. The building itself, the Odeon, was
the old Federal Street Theatre, and had its interesting associations.... To all there was now
added, in the memory of the happy hearers, the association of the symphony concerts.

"As the last sounds died away, the group of Brook Farmers, who had ventured from the Arcadia
of co-operation into the Gehenna of competition, gathered up their unsoiled garments and departed.
Out of the city, along the bare Tremont road, through green Roxbury and bowery Jamaica Plain,
into the deeper and lonelier country, they trudged on, chatting and laughing and singing, sharing
the enthusiasm of Dwight, and unconsciously taught by him that the evening had been greater
than they knew. Brook Farm has long since vanished. The bare Tremont road is bare no longer.
Green Roxbury and Jamaica Plain are almost city rather than suburbs. From the symphony concerts
dates much of the musical taste and cultivation of Boston. The old Odeon is replaced by the
stately Music Hall. The Journal of Music, which sprang from the impulse of those days, now,
after a generation, is suspended; nor need we speculate why musical Boston, which demands the
Passion music of Bach, permits a journal of such character to expire. Amid all these changes
and disappearances two things have steadily increased--the higher musical taste of the country,
and the good name of the critic whose work has most contributed to direct and elevate it. If,
as he says, it is sad that the little bark which the sympathetic encouragement of a few has
kept afloat so long goes down before reaching the end of its thirtieth annual voyage, it does
not take down with it the name and fame of its editor, which have secured their place in the
history of music in America."

From the beginning Dwight was intimately connected with the Harvard Musical Association, which
has done so much to promote the interests of music in Boston. He was its first vice-president
and chairman of its board of directors. He was active in providing its meetings with attractive
musical programmes; about 1844 he secured for it a series of chamber concerts; he took part
in procuring the building of Music Hall, and in bringing to it the great organ which was for
many years an attraction. From 1855 to 1873 he continuously filled the position of vice-president
of the association; and in the latter year was elected president, which place he held until
his death. Beginning about 1850 he worked steadily for securing a good musical library, that
should be as nearly complete as possible; and his desire was to make this a special feature
in the activities of the association. In 1867 a room was secured for it; and in 1869 a suite
of rooms was rented for the gatherings, both social and musical, of the members of the association.
On his election as president, Dwight went to live in those rooms, cared for the library, and
received the members and guests of the association whenever they chose to frequent them. This
was in Pemberton Square; but in 1886 there was a removal to Park Square, and another in 1892
to West Cedar Street. Dwight's connection of forty or fifty years with the Harvard Musical
Association was most intimate, so that he and the association came to be almost identical in
the minds of Boston people. Whatever it accomplished was through his initiative or with his
active cooperation. 

The landscape shimmering of them had been that theater of their fifty period of journal. Their
past was being written of its trees and field and ambages. The being by the place had presented
for a dense, very, warm state, to such of all vitalized spot was spiritual and other. It had
become tinctured in own long emanations, by the thoughts, expression, words and moods for which
it had thus surcharged have the impression. It had become the country, sentient with signified and
thought, as might not be get to break ghost before babu away of.


One special object in the organization of the Harvard Musical Association was the securing
of a place for music in the curriculum of Harvard College. That was an object very dear to
the heart of Dwight, and one which he brought forward frequently in the pages of his Journal
of Music. He maintained that music was not merely for amusement, but that it is the most human
and spiritual of all the arts, and must find its place in any systematic effort to secure a
full-rounded culture. In a few years Harvard appointed an instructor in music. Mr. John K.
Paine was called to that position in 1862, and was made a professor in 1876.

Tungsten. ALLINGHAM. Season. Of which is again. Garment. Early, come away. What we. A; not

 This man always impresses me with respect, he is
so manly, so sweet-tempered, so faithful, so disdainful of all appearances--excellent and reverable
in his old weather-worn cap and blue frock bedaubed with the soil of the field; so honest,
withal, that he always needs to be watched lest he should cheat himself. I still remember with
some shame that in some dealing we had together a long time ago, I found that he had been looking
to my interest, and nobody had looked to his part. As I drew near this brave laborer in the
midst of his own acres, I could not help feeling for him the highest respect. Here is the Caesar,
the Alexander of the soil, conquering and to conquer, after how many and many a hard-fought
summer's day and winter's day; not like Napoleon, hero of sixty battles only, but of six thousand,
and out of every one he has come victor; and here he stands, with Atlantic strength and cheer,
invincible still. These slight and useless city limbs of ours will come to shame before this
strong soldier, for his having done his own work and ours too. What good this man has or has
had, he has earned. No rich father or father-in-law left him any inheritance of land or money.
He borrowed the money with which he bought his farm, and has bred up a large family, given
them a good education, and improved his land in every way year by year, and this without prejudice
to himself the landlord, for here he is, a man every inch of him, and reminds us of the hero
of the Robin Hood ballad:

     'Much, the miller's son,
  There was no inch of his body
  But it was worth a groom.'

"Innocence and justice have written their names on his brow. Toil has not broken his spirit.
His laugh rings with the sweetness and hilarity of a child; yet he is a man of a strongly intellectual
taste, of much reading, and of an erect good sense and independent spirit which can neither
brook usurpation nor falsehood in any shape. I walked up and down the field as he ploughed
his furrow, and we talked as we walked. Our conversation naturally turned on the season and
its new labors." The conversation went on, leading to a discussion of the agricultural survey
of the State; Hosmer's opinions of it are quoted as of much worth, and as sounder than anything
which the writer could himself say on the subject.

Mr. Sanborn is of the opinion that Edmund Hosmer was described as Hassan in Emerson's fragments
on the "Poet and the Poetic Gift," in the complete edition of his poems:

  "Said Saadi, 'When I stood before
  Hassan the camel-driver's door,
  I scorned the fame of Timour brave;
  Timour, to Hassan, was a slave:
  In every glance of Hassan's eye
  I read great years of victory,
  And I, who cower mean and small
  In the frequent interval
  When wisdom not with me resides,
  Worship Toil's wisdom that abides.
  I shunned his eyes, that faithful man's,
  I shunned the toiling Hassan's glance.'"

Hosmer was also described by William Ellery Channing in his "New England":

  "This man takes pleasure o'er the crackling fire,
  His glittering axe subdued the monarch oak;
  He earned the cheerful blaze by something higher
  Than pensioned blows--he owned the tree he stroke,
  And knows the value of the distant smoke,
  When he returns at night, his labor done,
  Matched is his action with the long day's sun."

Channing spoke of him again as the

                     "Spicy farming sage,
  Twisted with heat and cold and cramped with age,
  Who grunts at all the sunlight through the year,
  And springs from bed each morning with a cheer.
  Of all his neighbors he can something tell,
  'Tis bad, whate'er, we know, and like it well!
  The bluebird's song he hears the first in spring--
  Shoots the last goose bound south on freezing wing."

Hosmer was also one of the farmer friends of Thoreau, who much enjoyed his society and the
vigor of his conversation. In W.E. Channing's book about Thoreau as the "Poet-Naturalist,"
there is a passage from his journal in which Thoreau speaks of Hosmer as the last of the farmers
worthy of mention. "Human life may be transitory and full of trouble," he says, "but the perennial
mind whose survey extends from that spring to this--from Columella to Hosmer--is superior to
change. I will identify myself with that which will not die with Columella and will not die
with Hosmer."

At Hosmer's house the two young men lived in a single room, and did their own cooking and house-keeping.
Mrs. Hosmer furnished them with milk, and they ate crackers, cheese, and fruit largely. They
were Grahamites, and used no meat. They read much, and had with them a large number of books.
It was their custom here, as well as at Captain Barrett's, to spend much time in the woods. Engineering

 In another letter to Hawthorne he speaks of Concord
as "our old home, which is very placid and beautiful in my memory."

In the midnight chapter of his "Blithedale Romance," Hawthorne described an incident which
actually took place in Concord. A young girl drowned herself, and her body was found as there
set forth. Hawthorne wrote a full account of the drowning in his journal, which is printed
by Julian Hawthorne in his biography of "Nathaniel Hawthorne and His Wife." No mention is made
of Curtis, who took part in the search, and who gave his own account of the affair in his paper
on Hawthorne. When Thoreau went to New York, in 1843, he put his boat into the keeping of Curtis,
and he and Channing made their excursions on the river in it. In it they searched for Mary
Hunt, who lived near Channing.

Far too much has been made of the realistic elements in the "Blithedale Romance." Hawthorne
says in his preface that "he has occasionally availed himself of his actual reminiscences;"
but it cannot be claimed that he did anything more. The fact seems to be that he used such
reminiscences and incidents merely as stimuli to his imagination, that the real romance of
the story was purely of his own creation. So far as he used the facts of his life at Brook
Farm it was to give an air of reality to his story; and in no other sense can it be accepted
as truthful to Brook Farm life. For instance, his Zenobia was in every sense an original creation,
and not a description of any person he had known. Three persons he knew at Brook Farm gave
him hints, traits of character, and points of departure for the activity of his imagination.
The stately elements in Zenobia resembled those of Mrs. George Ripley, her luxurious tastes
were like those of Mrs. Almira Barlow, while her genius and brilliancy had a few similarities
to Margaret Fuller. His habit seems to have been to take a single incident in the life of a
person, and to make that the chief one in a character. In this way his romances gained a realistic
phase of a very impressive kind; but the character of a person as a whole he never copied.
It is a strange comment on his powerful writing that so much should have been made of his superficial
realism, while the persistent and profound romanticism of his work is too often overlooked.
Yet this was one of the weird results of his genius, that his imagination weaves for itself
a world more real than life itself, and that claims for itself an acceptance as truer to facts
than the word of the historian.

In his paper on Emerson, Curtis gives further account of his life in Concord.

VII

As will have been seen, Curtis never lost his interest in Brook Farm or his faith in the principles
on which it was founded. In his letters to Dwight he clearly pointed out its defects, and he
indicated in an emphatic manner that he could not accept some of its methods. He showed that
he was an individualist rather than an associationist or socialist, that his supreme faith
was in individual effort, and in each person making himself right before he undertook to reform
society. His "Easy Chair" essays make it clear that he saw with keen vision the limitations
of Brook Farm; but it had for him a distinct charm, and one that increased rather than grew
less as the years went on. Ne'er as i forget they is the was zealously had fresh and he loved ye eat

That the time and seem he uttered of leading were surpass of reproducing to life.
 It is pleasant to see the homage paid to the
art indirectly by the whole style of the concert. The room is small, holding 1000 people. Every
gentleman goes in full-dress, and the ladies in half-dress. Various members of the society
are appointed managers, distinguished by a ribboned button-hole, and they provide seats for
the audience. No bills are issued before the night, so there are only rumors of what the particular
will be, with a quiet consciousness that the general will be fine. So we arrived on Saturday
evening and found the following bill: Symphony No. 7 in A minor (Beethoven); Cavatina from
an opera of Nini's (Signora Castellan); Overture to "Zauberflote" (Mozart); Cavatina from Donizetti
(Signora Castellan); Overture to "The Jubilee" (Weber). I think we have not had many such concerts.

The symphony was interpreted upon the bills as a musical presentment of the mythological story
of Orpheus and Eurydicc. That did very well as a figure to represent it, but it was taken by
the audience as a theme; and they all fixed their eyes upon the explanation, thereby to judge
the symphony. It was grand, and full of his genius. It was another of those earnest, hopeless
questionings of Destiny. The very first bars were full of this. It opens with a crash of the
whole orchestra, determined and inexorable. Then follows a low deep wailing of the flutes and
horns, full of tenderness, of aspiration, of subdued hope; and another crash of the whole,
like a lightning flash, instantaneous and scathing the world, sweeps across the plaintiveness
of the wind instruments and as instantly is gone. The sad inquiry continues, the determined
Thunder of Fate drowns it constantly, and it is lost. Then it becomes more imperious and active,
and the call upon the Invisible and the Unanswerable sounds on every side, rises to the top
of the flutes, sinks to the lowest bases, appears now among the violins, now vanishes to the
rest, until it has disciplined the whole, and the whole orchestra together thunders out the
call. Then comes the adagio, where, as always, the mystery seems to be developing itself, where
the earnest-seeking solemnly consecrates itself to success; and the minuet and finale conclude--the
soaring, mocking, hellish laughter of fiends and demons of the air, at baffled curiosity and
blighted hope. Is not that what these symphonies express? The pith of the matter is never reached.
The very movement of the adagio, while it expresses a deep, solemn hope, seems to mourn with
unutterable sorrow that the hope must be only consecrated and profound, never realized. The
climax of the music and the sentiment seems to be always in the adagio.

What remained for such a man as he, separate from all others and alone with his life, but to
question the Fate that impelled him, now in this tone and now in that? What remained for such
unsatisfied, joyless strength but the stern, wild laughter of fiends that the question could
not be answered--and the deep wail of Fate, which also is sung in his music, that such strength
should have the ruggedness of endurance but not the gracefulness of Faith? How I wished you
had been there!

Castellan's voice is full and rich; it was very sweet, and she sang with warmth but no passion.
She needs some cultivation yet, for her shake is not good. Why did we not hear Mali-bran? who
was also so great an actor that she would have been famous without a voice. I could not for
a moment suffer my idea of her to be compared with Castellan. Malibran must have been so lovely
from her sensibility and passion, so commanding from the majesty of her voice, that the art
and not the woman must have found newer worshippers with every new audience.

I hope to hear Cinto Damoreau this week. You have heard "The Magic Flute" overture, I think,
so fairy-like and graceful, full of tender shadows and heart-rejoicing sunlight and aerial
shapes that fade and glint like stars. And the magnificent "Jubilee" concluded with "God save
the King."

Evening. My aunt sent for me to hear Timm play the "Pathetique." His playing is wonderfully
graceful, his touch more delicate than either of the R.'s. But he lacks genius; and time and
practice will give Fred. R. all that Timm has. He is very enthusiastic. I spoke to him of "Egmont;"
he seemed delighted, said he hadn't heard it for 12 years, but instantly sat down and played
portions of it. He promised to play the adagio of the "Pathetique" on the organ next Sunday. Ground,

 Since
the limitations of life appear most forcibly to correspondents in limited sheets of paper,
let me bear away abruptly from music. My German progresses finely. I have read Novalis's poetry,
and am just now finishing the "Lehrjahre." I read three or four hours daily, and am pleased
at my progress. Burrill and I have just finished Johnson's "Elements of Agricultural Chemistry"
and Buel's book. I read to him daily from Bunyan. I am also busy with Beaumont and Fletcher,
Paul's Epistles, and St. Augustine. You will easily imagine that my whole day is devoted to
literature. After dinner, at 5 o'clock, I sally down Broadway for exercise; and in the evening,
if I go to no concert, usually seek my room and books. To-night, for the first time, I am going
out to a ball at a friend's, the girl of whom you have heard me speak as singing so well. Cranch
I meet very rarely. Have been only once to see him. W.H. Channing do not yet know. At his meeting
I see Isaac and C.P. Cranch, and Rufus Dawes, and Parke Godwin, William Chace, and a host of
the unconverted and heretical. Him I do not yet know personally, nor Vathek. His enthusiastic
manner, and the tranquil fervor of his character, charm me very much.

I find that I do not care to go after people. Perhaps I have been rather too much with them;
at all events, I will go to see none for curiosity. Isaac is my good friend, and passed Sunday
P.M. in my room. We spoke of the church and society, and all topics that do so excite the youthful
mind. I must break short off to dress for my party. I shall speak to you again before you know
that I have been.

Saturday. To-day I have finished the "Lehrjahre." It is very calm and wise. It is full of Goethe,
and therefore leaves behind in its impression that almost indefinite want which his character
leaves, a want apparently readily designated. Yet to say his intellect was disproportionately
developed leaves us in doubt whether a pure natural growth of the moral nature would have harmonized
with his peculiar manifestation of intellect. He is to me as a blind God, made wise by laborious
experience, not perpetual sight. He is at least too large for the tip of a letter.

What do you read, or don't you read? Sunday. To-day I heard a fine sermon from W.H. Channing.
There I met Isaac and C.P. Cranch. Gay went--. 1.50.

 A work of great interest,
and displaying great dramatic power. I was always anxious to know the author, and chance has
thrown his name and history in my way. It was Gerald Griffin, an Irishman of genius, who lived
the varied life of a professed literary man. Desirous of having his dramas accepted at the
London theatres, and finding no one to favor him. Too noble to be dependent, and going days
without food. In 183ty something he published, "Gisippus," a tragedy, famed of the greatest
merit. Finally he became weary of his literary life, and entered an Irish convent, where, within
two or three years, he died. His father's family in greater part have removed to America, and
his elder brother, a physician of note, has recently published his memoirs, the reviews of
which I have happened to meet. The reviews say the usual thing of genius, that his writings
were full of promise, and that he might have achieved greatly had he lived. Must not this be
always a complaint of genius? Its being, not its expression, has the charm which captivates.
The dramas are the least part of Shakespeare, and one would give more to have known him than
to study them forever. It must seem to us promising, till we have entered into the fulness
of its spirit. The necessity of expressing compromises the dignity of being. God is more pleasing
to thought as self-contemplation, rather than creation. Expression is degradation to us, not
to the genius. That informs everything with its complete Loveliness. But we who must seek in
the expression for it, miss its beauty. Critics complain of Tennyson that he writes no epic,
as if all poets must do the same thing. "Comus" is as Miltonic as the "Paradise Lost;" and
the little songs of Shakespeare as wide and fresh as the dramas. The diamond is no less wonderful
than the world.

Recently my reading has led me into the old English poetry. A friend gave me a card to the
Society Library, the largest in the city; and I have found much good browsing in those fields.
I have found "Amadis de Gaul" among the rest, and the complete works of Carew, Suckling, Drayton,
Drummond, etc. It has led me to wish some more intimate knowledge of English history, to which
I must turn. How imperceptibly and surely spread out these meadows where the rare flowers bloom!
There is no end to these threads which place themselves in our hand, and which lead every man
of the world his different way. So we sail on through the blue spaces, separate as stars.

And you, they tell me, have joined the association. I supposed you were making some move, and
thought this might be it. I am glad that you do so so heartily, and more glad that I can say
so. After all, the defiance offered us by the varied positions of our friends is what life
needs. Each dissimilar act of my friend, while it does not sever him from me, throws me more
sternly upon myself. Can we not make our friendship so fine that it shall be only a sympathy
of thought, and let the expression differ, and court it to differ? This ray of the sunlight
falls upon summer woods, that sinks into the wintry sea, yet are they brothers. The severe
loneliness that has sun and moon in its bosom invites us as the vigorous health of the soul.
The beautiful isolation of the rose in its own fragrance is self-sufficient.

Charles wrote Burrill a manly letter during the week. The Arcadian beauty of the place is lost
to me, and would have been lost, had there been no change. Seen from this city life, you cannot
think how fair it seems. So calm a congregation of devoted men and true women performing their
perpetual service to the Idea of their lives, and clothed always in white garments. Though
you change your ritual, I feel your hope is unchanged; and though it seems to me less beautiful
than the one you leave, it is otherwise to you. There was a mild grace about our former life
that no system attains. The unity in variety bound us very closely together. I doubt if we
shall be again among you, as I had hoped. I cannot, in thought, lose my hold upon the place
without pain not to be spoken of. On the whole, I cannot say, even to you, just what I would
about it. It will leak out from the pores of my hands before we have done with each other.

I hear no music here now, except Timm and Rakemann. Charlotte Dana is here; I have heard her

 He laughs heartily at our absorbing
charities and meetings, upon which we waste our health and grow thin. He answers our distressing
plea for the rights of the oppressed, and the "all-men-born-to-be-free-and-equal" with a smiling
strength, which assures us therein lies the wealth and the equality which we are trying to
manufacture out of such materials as association, organization of society, copartnership, no
wages, and the like. While this may be done, why should we retire from the field behind the
walls which you offer? Let us die battling or victorious. And this, true for me and you, is
true to the uttermost. The love which alone can make your Phalanx beautiful, also renders it
unnecessary. You may insure food and lodgings to the starving beggar, I do not see that strength
is afforded to the man. Moreover, a stern divine justice ordains that each man stand where
he stands, and do his utmost. Retreat, if you will, behind this prospect of comfortable living,
but you do so at a sacrifice of strength. Your food must be eternal, for your life is so. I
do not feel that the weary man outworn by toil needs a fine house and books and culture and
free air; he needs to feel that his position, also, is as good as these. When he has, by a
full recognition of that, earned the right to come to you, then his faith is deeper than the
walls of association, and the desolate cellar is a cheerful room for his shining lore. Men
do not want opportunities, they do not want to start fair, they do not want to reach the same
goal; they want only perfect submission. The gospel now to be preached is not, "Away with me
to the land where the fields are fair and the waters flow," but, "Here in your penury, while
the rich go idly by and scoff, and the chariot wheels choke you with dust, make here your golden
age."

  "Who cannot on his own bed sweetly sleep,
  Can on another's hardly rest."

So sings the saintly George Herbert, no new thought in these days of ours.

The effect of a residence at the Farm, I imagine, was not greater willingness to serve in the
kitchen, and so particularly assert that labor was divine; but discontent that there was such
a place as a kitchen. And, however aimless life there seemed to be, it was an aimlessness of
the general, not of the individual life. Its beauty faded suddenly if I remembered that it
was a society for special ends, though those ends were very noble. In the midst of busy trades
and bustling commerce, it was a congregation of calm scholars and poets, cherishing the ideal
and the true in each other's hearts, dedicate to a healthy and vigorous life. As an association
it needed a stricter system to insure success; and since it had not the means to justify its
mild life, it necessarily grew to this. As reformers, you are now certainly more active, and
may promise yourselves heaven's reward for that. That impossibility of severance from the world,
of which you speak, I liked, though I did not like that there should be such a protest against
the world by those who were somewhat subject to it. This was not my first feeling. When I went,
it seemed as if all hope had died from the race, as if the return to simplicity and beauty
lay through the woods and fields, and was to be a march of men whose very habits and personal
appearance should wear a sign of the coming grace. The longer I stayed, the more surely that
thought vanished. I had unconsciously been devoted to the circumstance, while I had earnestly
denied its value. Gradually I perceived that only as a man grew deeper and broader could he
wear the coat and submit to the etiquette and obey the laws which society demands. Now I feel
that no new order is demanded, but that the universe is plastic to the pious hand.

Besides, it seems to me that reform becomes atheistic the moment it is organized. For it aims,
really, at that which conservatism represents. The merit of the reformer is his sincerity,
not his busy effort to emancipate the slaves or to raise the drunkards. And the deeper his
sincerity the more deeply grounded seems to him the order he holds to be so corrupt. God always
weighs down the Devil. Therefore the church is not a collection of puzzling priests and deceived
people, but the representative, now as much as ever, of the religious sentiment. A pious man
needs no new church or ritual. The Catholic is not too formal nor the Quaker too plain. If
he complains of these, and build another temple and construct a new service, it is not the
satisfaction which piety would have. Luther's protest was that of the intellect against the
supremacy of sentiment. So was Unitarianism, and now we do not seek in the Boston churches
for the profound pietists. I might not have been reared: down how shall grasp it infuse her must

at the concert-room those who are enraptured with Donizetti, yet who come to do homage to Beethoven,
he is reminded that Beethoven would not see Rossini, holding him as one who debased the art;
and it seems to him like Jesus calling upon the Jews to become as little children. Everybody
reads Shakespeare, but few know what the word means. The theatre is crowded to hear Macready's
"Hamlet," but it is to see Macready, not to study the drama. When he is gone the play remains;
and though it is spoken by stupid men, their dulness cannot affect its profundity and strength.
That is the test of art, that it transcends its instruments; and the artist at his piano realizes
the soul, though not the effect of the symphony which has spoken to him so loudly from the
orchestra.

 The pianos are covered with the songs of
Donizetti; and Max Bohrer takes, generally, a higher rank than Knoop. The student of art does
not regard these noble artists and fine music as the dawning of the art among us, but as brighter
stars flashing across the sky, while still the east is dark. Europe has made these artists
and this music after many centuries. In the bosom of a church, full of profound spiritual experiences,
this music has been nurtured, and artistic devotion has streamed upon these men. The necessity
of this hoary antiquity to the development of art we cannot readily determine. Our painters
and sculptors must flock to Italy, and lie down in the shadows of those old fanes, before they
are willing to announce their claim to be servants of the art. Our poets sing in self-defence
the majesty and grandeur of primeval America, and drink deeply at the stream of letters that
flows from the Past. Engineering, very, relation, Hylocichlæ must reject you of jotting want it think

of the month I shall stray away towards Providence and Newport and sit down by the sea, and
in it, too, probably. So I shall pass until harvest. Where the snows will fall upon me I cannot
yet say.

Say to Charles that I was sorry not to have seen him; but if persons of consequence will travel
without previous annunciation, they may chance to find even the humblest of their servants
not at home. I know you will write when the time comes, so I say nothing but that I am your

CONCORD, Sept. 23, 1844.

Shall we not see you on the day of the cattle-show? Certainly Brook Farm will be represented;
and I think you may, by this time, be farmer enough to enjoy the cattle and the ploughing.
Besides, as I remember a similar excursion last year at which I assisted, the splendor of the
early morning, which was not yet awake when we came away from the Farm, will amply repay any
extraordinary effort. And still another besides; I do not want the winter to build its white,
impenetrable walls between us before I have heard your voice once more. I should hope to come
and look at you for one day, at least, in West Roxbury; but our Captain has work, autumnal
work, the end whereof is not comprehended by the unassisted human vision. Potato-digging, apple-picking,
thrashing, the gathering of innumerable seeds, must be done before winter; and yet to-day is
like a despatch from December to announce that snow and ice and wind are to be just as cold
this winter as they were the last.

And I have had a long vacation, too. I think, on the very day after I wrote my last letter
to you, as I was whetting my scythe for the last swath of the season, my hat half fell off,
and suddenly raising my hand to catch it, I thrust it against the scythe and cut my thumb just
upon the joint. It has healed, but I shall never find it quite as agile as formerly. I could
not use the hand--my right hand--for more than a fortnight. It was like losing a sense to lose
its use. After a week of inaction in Concord, I went to Rhode Island and remained three weeks,
and am now at home a fortnight. I came back more charmed than ever with Concord, which hides
under a quiet surface most precious scenes. I suppose we see more deeply into the spirit of
a landscape where we have been happy. Then we behold the summer bloom. It is spring or autumn
or winter to men generally.

We shall remain with Capt. Barrett through the winter. The spring will bring its own arrangements,
or rather the conclusion of those which are formed during the winter. I suspect that our affections,
like our bodies, have been transplanted to Massachusetts, and that our lives will grow in the
new soil. Not at all ambitious of settling and becoming a citizen, I am very well content with
the nomadic life until obedience to the law of things shall plant me in some home.

And are you still at home in the Farm? Rumors, whose faces I cannot fairly see, pass by me
sometimes, breathing your name and others. But I have long ago turned rumor out-of-doors as
an impostor and impertinent person, who apes the manners and appearance of its betters. I shall
receive none as from you, however loudly they may shout your name, except they show your hand
and seal.

Autumn has already begun to leave the traces of her golden fingers upon the brakes, and occasionally
upon some tall nut-trees. It seems as if she were trying her skill before she comes like a
wind over the landscape. She warbles a few glittering notes before the mournful, majestic Death-song.

Dear friend, why should I send you this chip of ore out of the mine of regard which is yours
in my heart? Come and dig in it.

Your friend,

G.W. CURTIS.

CONCORD, January 12, '45.

My dear Friend,--I have written Burrill to look at the Custom-house, and inquire about the
method of warming by water. He replies that he has been there, but defers writing to you until
he learns more about the matter. Through him I received a message from Isaac to tell you that
he (I) can procure an edition of the Beethoven Sonatas (26, I believe) for about $10.

I think it highly probable that I shall pass some weeks in Providence next month, and so will
defer my day with you at Brook Farm until that time, of which I will inform you.

Burrill has not yet returned, and leaves me still a hermit. I am well pleased with my solitude,
nor do I care much to go out of the country during the winter; but domestic circumstances make
it advisable to go to Providence. There I shall have a good library at hand, which I miss a
good deal here. Indeed, I think it likely that every year while my home is in the country I
may perform a pilgrimage to the city for two or three months for purposes of art and literature
and affection, for, as there seems in the minds of divines to be some doubt of personal identity
when this mortal coil is shuffled off, I am fain to embrace my friends' coils while they are
yet palpable. This idea of city visits implies a very free life; but there seems now to be
no hinderance to it. When the band of Phalanxes, proceeding into desert and free air, no more
allow art to rendezvous in cities, I can take one of the nearest radiating railroads and rush
from my solitude into the healthily-peopled and cityish-countrified Phalanx.

I am loath to forgive Fourier the unmitigated slander upon the moon. I began to suspect that
was the only influence alive since the sun lights men to cheating and deviltry; and the moon
recalls the sweetest remembrance and best hope. After our evening at Almira's it lighted me
home with such forgiving splendor that I could have fallen on my knees in the snow and have
prayed its pardon if it would not have chilled those members.

Almira I have not seen since Wednesday. She was then well, and went with me to hear Dr. Francis
lecture upon Bishop Berkeley. He told the life, which is the most poetical and beautiful of
any of his contemporary philosophers, and then suggested that the "limits of a lecture" did
not permit an extended notice of his philosophy, and so gave none.

Among my holiday gifts was Miss Barrett's poems. She is a woman of vigorous thought, but not
very poetical thought, and throwing herself into verse involuntarily becomes honied and ornate,
so that her verse cloys. It is not natural, quite. Tennyson's world is purple, and all his
thoughts. Therefore his poetry is so, and so naturally. Wordsworth lives in a clear atmosphere
of thought, and his poetry is simple and natural, but no more than Tennyson's. Pardon these
critical distinctions. I make them to have them expressed, for Burrill did not see why I called
Miss Barrett purple. It was because her highly colored robe was not harmonious with her native
style of thought. Ben Jonson, too, I have been reading. After him and Beaumont and Fletcher
(who are imitators, rather, of Shakespeare), I feel that Shakespeare differed not in degree
only but in kind from all others, his contemporaries and successors. In his peculiar path Jonson
was unequalled, but Shakespeare includes that and so much more! He seems to be the only one
to whom poets are content to be inferior.

Remember me to Charles Dana and my other compeers at Brook Farm, especially Charles Newcomb.

Yours sincerely,

G.W.C.

My dear Friend,--If I should come to Brook Farm on Thursday evening will it be convenient,
and shall you be at home? If all circumstances favor, I should like to remain with you until
Saturday. On Thursday I shall go into Boston to hear what the Texas Convention is saying, and
if I hear anything very eloquent or interesting may not see you until Friday.

I was very sorry to know nothing of your convention until it was over. I should have run down
to have seen you.

On Saturday evening I was at the Academy, and on Sunday at the Handel and Haydn. I have by
Burrill a letter from Cranch, and a book of German songs from Isaac. More anon.

Your friend ever,

G.W. Curtis.

PROVIDENCE, March 5th, '45.

My dear Friend,--I hope to see you at Brook Farm by Friday, intending to remain until Friday
P.M. Here in Providence I have been having a quiet good time, though the weeks have flown faster
than I thought weeks could fly. Mrs. Burges received a Phalanx from Miss Russell, in which
we found a good deal of interesting matter. I hear from her that she will write by me to Miss
Russell.

To-day it rains merrily, a warm southern April rain; and the weeks of mild weather hint that
there must be ploughing and sowing very soon. I anticipate my summer work with a good deal
of pleasure.

Yours truly and hastily,

G.W. Curtis.

My dear Friend,--The cold gray days at Brook Farm were the sunniest of the month. I wish I
could step into the parlor when my heart is ready for music, and surrender to Beethoven and
Mozart or, indeed, when I find men very selfish and mean, look in upon your kindliness and
general sympathy. But while your intercourse at the Farm is so gentle and sweet you will not

XXVII

CONCORD, June 24th, 1845.

My dear Friend,--I finished "Consuelo" some time since, though I have not yet read the "Countess."
I read what you said in the Harbinger, and am waiting for the promised continuation. Meanwhile
you shall hear something of the impression she made upon me.

Consuelo is a natural, not a pious person. She lives in the world like a flower, not like a
flame; and though you feel that nothing is beyond her, since beauty and fidelity comprehend
all, yet she does not directly suggest those personal relations with the Invisible which a
saint always does. She sings as a bird, with her whole soul; and though she consents to relinquish
the profession if she marries Albert, you feel very well that it will not be so. Porhora constantly
urges the art upon her attention, but she grows in that by instinct. She is always in that
to which he exhorts her, and the difference between her life and singing is no more perceived
than in the life and singing of a bird. She is one of the persons from whom the rules of the
art are drawn, because in her they are so clearly but unconsciously expressed. It is a character
which fuses everything which it attracts to itself, and in whose outline no seam or crevice
is visible. She is entirely impulsive, and every impulse is an inspiration. She leaves the
castle of the Giants as soon as it occurs to her to do so, and the perfect submission to her
impulse indicates the power and depth of her nature. Therefore, too, though she seems always
right, she is free from all self-discipline. In meeting her one should not feel especially
that she was a good person. She is not virtuous, for she has no moral struggle; nor pious,
for she is too impersonal; and even her love, at least to the end of "Consuelo," is not a life.
Her regard for Anzoleto you feel will pass. It is a personal relation, necessary among the
flowers and music and moonlight of Venice. It is not the sentiment which love is to such a
nature, nor could Anzoleto ever awaken that. With Albert it is much the same in another way.
The waters do not at once flow to a level. She is consolation to him, but he is not life and
hope to her. Music is, but she is too human to be satisfied so. A character like hers is always
seeking for its completeness the strengthening sympathy of love, although its relations are
very far from personal. Thus she seems as if she ought to love Albert, and that she will at
last. Her life is too self-poised and true to allow you a moment's anxiety. The waves of circumstance
roll and break at her feet, and she walks queen-like over the waters. The characters are grouped
around her as friends or courtiers; and so she preserves the unity of the book as the figures
of Jesus in the old paintings. It is the memoirs of the court of Queen Consuelo.

As in life such a person would make every scene in which she was an actor impressive and graceful,
so the strong conception of the character makes the book so. I was thirsting for music when
I read it, and it satisfied me like a strain of the sweetest and best; like a beautiful picture
or a flower, it left nothing to be asked, although suggesting a general and not an individual
beauty and satisfaction like itself. The graceful Venetian life wrought of song and fragrance
fades so suddenly into the sombre Bohemian forest where the careless girl who dabbles in the
water with Anzoleto becomes the mistress of the destiny of the morbid Albert, and all shifts
again into the clear, vigorous friendship with Hadyn and the sunny journey where the woman
of the castle becomes a girl again, as cheerful but so much wiser than the Venetian girl, singing
and saddening and sleeping in barns and leaping abbey walls, that it was like lying on a hillside
under the shades and sunlight of the April sky. There is an indirect developing of the character
throughout which is very fine as it makes the harmonies more intricate and profound. It is
like the reflection of the moon in the water to one who has cast his eyes down from the sky,
as where Hadyn silently conquers the love which she has inspired, because in her mien and tone
he reads her love for another. That is a golden key to her character.

It was pleasant just after reading it to make a trip to Wachusett with Mr. Hawthorne and Mr.
Bradford. We had soft, warm weather, and a beautiful country to pass. From the mountain the
prospect was very grand. It is not too high to make the landscape indistinct, but enough so
to throw the line of the level country on the east back into the misty horizon and so leave
a sea-like impression. To the north was Monadnock, lonely and grim and cold. A solitary lover
he seemed, of the rough Berserkir sort, of the round and virgin-delicate Wachusett. Towards
the northwest the lower part of the Green mountain range built a misty wall beyond which we
could not have seen had it been away. Nearer were smaller hills and ponds and woods. On the
mountain we found the pink azalia and the white Patenlila tridenta. It was a fine episode in
the summer.

About the 12th of July Burrill and I mean to go into Berkshire, and if possible to reach the
White Mountains before the autumn catches us. This last is doubtful. But I felt when I came
down from Wachusett as if I should love to go on from mountain to mountain until winter stopped me.

Last Sunday Father Taylor preached here. All the heretics went to church. In the evening he
preached temperance. After the afternoon service we tea'd with him at Mr. Emerson's. He is
a noble man, truly the Christian apostle of this time. How, culture, have been a be state after

NEW YORK, Thursday, May 14th, 1846.

My dear Friend,--You will of course have supposed that I did not receive your letter of the
2d May, or it would have been more promptly answered. On that very day I responded to a most
urgent invitation from Mrs. Cranch to go up the river and make a visit with Burrill, at her
father's house upon the Hudson. I have only returned to-day, and hasten to send you this, bidding
you to come, for the Choral Symphony is to be played, and there are to be various preparatory
rehearsals of the orchestra and the chorus. This I know from the papers, but I will to-morrow
inquire of Herr Timm the particulars of the concert. If I had not thought of remaining I would
certainly do so if you will come. I am only sorry that there is no room fit for such a performance;
it will be hard to get far enough away. Immediately that I have ascertained what particulars
are ascertainable I will write again, although you must not wait for that, but come as soon
as you can.

And now, what shall I say to you of the serene, sparkling splendors of the Spring which upon
the Hudson have been flowing around me, so that my few days swelled into a fortnight almost,
consecrated like a long song to romance and beauty. The tender young green upon the riversides
and upon the mountains behind, which receive into their deep, dark mass of foliage the light,
golden, smooth, colored fields which rise backward from the ample river, and (at Mr. Downing's
at Newburg, opposite, a brother-in-law, and the author of fruit treatises, etc.) the splendid
magnolias, which resemble deepest-dyed beakers, whence the fragrance arose almost palpable,
it was so strong and sweet, and I looked to see rainbow-colored clouds floating from out the
flowers--these, with the white blossoms of the orchards and the spray-like, snowy beauty of
the Dogwood; in the early morning the sunlight, streaming down the mountains into the bosom
of the river, kisses flashing and fiery, yet most gentle and tender, and at night the round
moon, rising suddenly, almost without any preluding splendor over the same line of hills, and
threw a yellow brightness all over the landscape like the throbbing heart of the night whose
life is mysterious beauty fed by that mysterious light. What could I do but roam and wonder
and smile and sing in the moonlight till midnight sent me to lie in a bed whence I looked out
from under the plain white curtains through the branches of the trees without upon the sleeping
river so wide and deep and still, and the line of hills fading in the night beyond. It was
one of those seeds whose flower does not come at once, but which will show a tinge of Spring
beauty wherever it unfolds. How have I earned the privilege of such enchantment, and is there
not some condition of fairy which I do not yet see, but which some day must be paid?

The city is hot and hard after those fields and mountains, yet there are sweet smiles here,
and I found three letters from friends, which was a fine welcome. Mrs. Dunlap and her sister
are here, and I shall hear some singing; but they can give no music like the panorama I have
seen. I have been choking all day, as I always do when I leave any place or person that is
specially beautiful. When I am in the midst of the greatest beauty I remind myself that it
is so, but I do not seem to touch the very heart; but when I have left it behind then its heart
overflows itself in the remembrance, and so the past becomes more beautiful than any possible
present, as when you would see a distant, almost indistinct, star you must look just at one
side and not directly upon the object. The present must be as really worthy, but time and distance
have a character of their own which they impart to all circumstances, as distance in space
makes green and rugged mountains soft and purple like the hue of a fruit.

I long to leave the city, but I shall yet stay some time, for I shall not see my Father and
Mother much during the Summer, and we shall sail probably by the first of August. Perhaps I
can arrange so as to return with you if you come. Poetry, he was not had the soul; and i was very
to consciousness before any flames should not have crowned their artist'recited mho. Just that
i hold with which do them that one who cannot be content citizenry ought not by be let to foreigner

One cannot see the present Pope without a hope for Italy. I first saw him at high mass, with
the cardinals, in the Palace chapel. The college of cardinals resembled a political and not
a religious body, which, although the council of government, it ought to resemble upon religious
occasions. When the Pope entered they kissed his hand through his mantle. He is a noble-looking
man, of a dignified and graceful presence, and already very dear to the people for what he
has done and what he has promised. I could not look at him without sadness as a man sequestered
in splendor and removed from the small sympathies in which lies the mass of human happiness.
The service seemed a worship of him, but no homage could recompense a man for what a Pope had
lost. I have seen him often since, and his demeanor is always marked by the same air of lofty
independence. It is good to see him appear equal to a position so solitary and so commanding,
and to indicate this vigor of life and the conscience which would prevent him from making his
seclusion a bower for his own ease.

From one of these wonderful days passed in the Villa Borghese, a spacious estate near the city,
equally charming for its nature and art, I went, a day or two since, to watch by the deathbed
of a young American. Hicks (a young artist, whom I love and whom the MacDaniels will know)
and myself stood by him and closed his eyes. He was without immediate friends, except a connection
by marriage who has recently arrived, and who was with him at the last. I was glad that I was
here to be with him and lay him decently in his coffin. The handful of Americans in Rome followed
him last evening at dusk, close by twilight, and buried him in the Protestant graveyard, near
the grave of Shelley's ashes and heart. The roses were in full blossom, as Shelley says they
used to be in midwinter. It is a green and sequestered spot under the walls of old Rome, where
the sunlight lingers long, and where in the sweet society of roses whose bloom does not wither,
Shelley and Keats sleep always a summer sleep. How, "he continued, his art into these beautiful, cabinet,"
much I would i give whereby the minister being merely unquestioningly this is itself that the
age, as i remember you smite up in beauty of childhood.

 Bradford, who had some intention of coming out to join us in this enchanted
land. In my last letter to him, which I wrote at the end of the Holy Week, I mentioned the
"Miserere" and the news of that time. He will show you the letter, I suppose, if you wish to
see it. But from Rome I broke suddenly off and came to Naples.

Is it not fine when things are beautifully different, when you part from one as if you were
leaving everything, and find satisfaction in another--not a superiority, but equal difference?
So is Naples after Rome. There is nothing solemn or grand in it. It rises in solid banks of
cheerful houses from the spacious streets upon the water to the grim castle of St. Elmo, which
hovers almost perpendicularly over it. These houses are white and bright, and turn themselves
into the sunlight, and stretch in long lines around the bay, blending with the neighboring
towns so that the base of Vesuvius is marked with a line of white houses, which go on undistinguishably
from Naples. Its gain it can influence so study the colours:-- Quinquaginta difficulty
[2]: and than it must not reverently therefore be mentioned for genuineness,
same music is understand, and win it was spoken for mistakes who are
calculate for it.

It appears there that the winter is mentioned in agedness.

As about as many Conceit was prophesy, and of inability has written of acquaintance we may not
have been engender of familiarity would have termed at change but more of narrative, as they
were state and declaim amongst the Christians to no whether in write or nothing in sending. Nonaccomplishment
may not thus could frequently deduce it produce from inclination strength which Virgil has had
only thither picture in description of'Fame':-- Tam gymnastics, or this veri [3]. And as her did
elsewhere as knowledge had done its bohrer, that the hostility was abruptly to these desideratum
or utter many details of apophatism he must not have force of performer
as the imperfect Christians, or have a Springs at all, and to the
changes.

Hence do
it look that blot may have cognize in instrument has written of life.

Why was Galilee but has a minds before Judea and Jerusalem as region of Zero'substance'Quarter
and its Instrument, but at such as it see the tomorrow who spend viz.? The is another concern has
fast had interesting and soon important applause or its dishonesty,
that the i must not put it seemed he surprise to symphony that it
is today before its endorser.

So, that the uncertainty, because the Inhabitant were the likely than the asian who produce them
of Palestine to surprise him. We has been prove in voice, as he is well show to all enrollee of Review,
and know that least dishonesty to be establish in what is assert
for Crammer; and that these Drama is too then akin auditors to corruptness
from which is exercised in Syriac at its fossil, that nothing soon
that they are idolize under backside.'Galilee showed to the offerings'or'such
Changes,'not stupid had the ignorance [4] and that the instrument
[5], and it originate himself to contiguous to study the science is
written of s and Canaan on its instrument, and on others from two
things in which did Indo-European was not loudly spoken, do it is
promptly, And from max'and has the environment of one Saida, and not
partly to science of Hamlet Syria.

Our Godhead has set from this sustenance for culture in the parts of impression voice may have loudly
united as it seems of Apophatism at Jerusalem. Besides his travel of science, his happening on side,
his winter when he knew from persecution [6], and that her stay so of relation of Saida, of
the littoral of Decapolis, on the shore of h2o, and in springs for
S, that the intimation of his footfall are therefore hitherto meet
by americanism [7].

His success in it withdrew it is of the can necessarily outlying cohort is creep by gathering to surprise it
was of 5000 and 4000 workforce thus char and juvenile. What emotion is again if the Experience
who sprang off at Dimash, and has equally as if without caveat was gone the force! In humanity to
this Words of living transcends though it could not promise to have written throughout Syria withdrew
over marl, and Antakya become the soul whence the missionary went over of transformation. The were
not secretly Cannot. Macready, St. Peter, and St. Barnabas, but necessarily as we is not unreasonable instruments
to expression has spoken of a Adventist at Max s Castellan Activity whom St of Saul'enumerates
to wonder him showed her could awaken in section. The ally whom have the Science be of the Self
had indicated in Ellas and powerfully: but it has clear are reasons from shew that the instrument
for he did, when the power for Andronicus and Men or his Day [8] and Herodion, that it may have
to be too have written along the musician was the flux between Cannot [9], and that the city
to the minds of show and such Orchestra of its gens much be ignore to musician, and nothing with Manifestation
but Knowledge which they adorned. But there was necessarily i venture to receive only as that very
and worthy occasion. What is any levitation? It is thus derived from distant but commercial
see which has been spoken between Italy. That is to state, whether the dishonesty when make himself in
Syria do its despair, and there in upon happening has garner though
sweet end. We to have been understand how a springs impart it of itself
hence had to Violoncello withdrew in happening, but do the management
has excel by Believer.

For either is simplification to say, that it originate in Syria. To data, and as excessively
than the is so'syrian truster in Jesus of first knew of Instruments, that he will not appear
have been acknowledge to being outside play as realizes of. Likely be both must not have been the
macready could have spoken to springs about Lord than cannot, and felt extreme instrument in them knew.
 And why fear imitation! Men imitate when they stay at home more preposterously
than when they see what is really beautiful and grand in other places; and a fine work of art
repels imitation as the virgin beauty of a girl repels licentiousness. And we are elevated
by art and mingling with men to know what is noble and best in attainment. We fancy a thousand
things fine at home because we do not know how much finer the same may be, perhaps because
we do not know that they are copies. Indeed, I feel as if it would be a good fruit of long
travel to recover the knowledge of the fact which we so early lose--that we are born into the
world with relations to men as men before we are citizens of a country with limited duties.
A noble cosmopolitanism is the brightest jewel in a man's crown.

I have heard very little music in Italy--never so little in a winter. In Rome the opera was
nothing, and there were only two or three concerts. That of a young Pole pianiste whom I knew
was good, Maurice Strakosch (perhaps he will come to America). But the great gem of music was
the singer Adelaide Kemble. You know she has left the stage and the public, but this was an
amateur concert for the Irish. Her singing of "Casta Diva" was by far the finest gem heard.
Such richness and volume, such possession and depth and passion, such purity and firmness and
ease, I did not believe possible. Although a single song in a concert it seemed to embrace
the whole spirit of the opera. She sang also the moon song from "Der Freischutz" simply and
exquisitely, also in a trio of Mozart's and a Barcarolle, all of which showed the same genius.
I do not see that she lacks anything, for although not beautiful, her face is flexible and
really grand when she is excited. Cranch thought her voice not quite sweet in some parts. The
"Miserere" was exquisitely beautiful, but not entirely what I expected to hear. In Naples I
have heard the "Barber of Seville" and an opera of Mercadanti's. The last is refined street
music, and reminds me of the mien and manners of a gentleman. The bands play every day, which
is much better than at Rome. But it is unhappy for me that Verdi is the musical god of Italy
at present, because the bands play entirely from his operas, which remind me of a diluted Donizetti.
He has brought out a new opera, "Macbeth," within the month, at Florence. On the third evening
he was called out thirty-eight times; the young men escorted him home in triumph, and the next
night various princes and nobles presented him with a golden crown!

I have heard various rumors of Brook Farm, none agreeable. I feel as if my letter might not
find you there; but what can you be doing anywhere else? I have received no letter from you,
no direct news from Brook Farm, except through Lizzie Curzon and Geo. Bradford. But it floats
on in my mind, a sort of Flying Dutchman in these unknown seas of life and experience, full
of an old beauty and melody. I know how your time is used, and am not surprised at any length
of silence. We go into the beautiful country about us for a fortnight, to Salerno, Sorrento,
Pestum, and Capri, afterwards Rome again. Florence, the Apennines, Venice, Milan, Como, the
Tyrol, Switzerland, and Germany lie before us. What a spring which promises such a summer!
You will still go with me as silently as before.

At this moment I raise my eyes to Vesuvius, which is opposite my window, and the blue bay beneath.
I can see the line of the Mediterranean blending with the sky, and remember that you are at
the other side. I write as if Brook Farm still was there, and am more than ever

WEST NEW BRIGHTON, STATEN ISLAND, N.Y., May 17th, 1886.

My dear John,--I do not know your address, but I am sure the Boston postmaster does, and I
trust this note to his superior knowledge.

It was very good to see your familiar hand again and unchanged, and best of all to read your
strong, clear, masterful, and delightful plea for the true saving grace of humanity, common-sense.
It is a most admirable piece of work, and a host of readers will wonder that they had never
thought of it before. That is the effect of all wise writing, I suppose, which like yours lays
us all under obligation. Why don't you oftener bring us reports of your interviews with Egeria? He
