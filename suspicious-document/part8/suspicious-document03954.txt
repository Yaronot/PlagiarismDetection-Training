     REPORT ON THE DEPARTMENT OF PORTS AND HARBOURS
     FOR THE YEAR 1890-91.

     Presented to both Houses of Parliament by Command.

TO THE HONOURABLE THE COLONIAL TREASURER.

     Department of Ports and Harbours,
     Brisbane, 26th August, 1891.

SIR,--I have the honour to submit, for your information, the following Report concerning this
Department for the past year:--

I assumed charge on the 1st July, 1890, and found that the heavy gales and floods experienced
in January of the same year had most seriously affected several of the dredged cuttings of
the Brisbane, Mary, Burnett, and Fitzroy Rivers. In some places the Brisbane River had silted
up to such an extent that there were fully 18 inches less water than before the flood. This,
however, only proved a temporary inconvenience, as the dredges soon restored the cuttings to
their original depths. I also found that considerable changes had taken place in the formation
of the banks at the northern entrance to Moreton Bay, necessitating the removal--to make the
lead effective--of Tangaluma Light (which had only been established in 1885), also the removal
(for the fourth time) of the Yellow Patch Light, and the building of two new cottages for the
lightkeepers. Owing to the encroachment of the sea, it had also been found necessary to remove
Comboyuro Point Lighthouse and the keeper's cottage some 200 feet further inland. This work
was accomplished by the Inspector, Mr. H. L. Pethebridge. The floating beacon which marked
the northern entrance to the port had been ashore on Bribie Island for some time, but, during
the first interval of settled westerly weather, she was floated and brought to Brisbane to
be repaired and supplied with new moorings, after which she was on the 8th August replaced
in her former position, and by the end of October the works of the Department generally, which
had suffered in the early portion of the year, were restored.

In January and February of the present year another series of heavy gales was experienced along
the whole coast of the Colony, and on the 6th, 7th, and 8th of June a gale of unusual severity,
accompanied by torrents of rain, swept along the coast from Bowen southwards, causing heavy
seas and abnormally high tides. Such unfavourable weather, of course, occasioned considerable
loss to the Department, a great number of buoys being driven from their moorings (some lost
altogether), and beacons and other plant receiving a large amount of damage.

MORETON BAY AND BRISBANE RIVER.

The banks at the northern entrance to Moreton Bay are constantly shifting, and the maintenance
of the necessary lights and buoys to enable vessels to enter and clear the port in safety is
a source of continual anxiety. The floating beacon, which had broken adrift during the month
of February, disappeared altogether on the 10th March; and although diligently searched for,
no trace of her has been discovered. Two valuable buoys disappeared from the outer banks about
the same time. The floating beacon has been replaced by a new second-class (Trinity pattern)
steel conical buoy, surmounted with a staff and cage, the top of which is 12 feet above the
water, forming a most conspicuous object. New buoys have been moored in the positions of those
lost.

No. 1 cutting, Hamilton Reach, has now a depth of 17 feet at low water, spring tides; and the
entrance to the bar cutting is being dredged to a similar depth. The increased depth of water
in these cuttings is of considerable importance to vessels of heavy draught. A depth of 15
feet at low water, spring tides, is fully maintained in the other cuttings, but there are several
shallow places in the town reaches of the river which require attention.

The more recent gales and floods do not appear to have injuriously affected the dredged cuttings
of the Brisbane River. Several new beacons have been erected to replace those blown down or
found defective; and, to render them more conspicuous, heads have been placed on some of the
beacons marking the bar cutting. Beyond some slight repairs, now being effected, all the sea
and river marks for the navigation of this port are in good order, and the various buildings
are not likely to require any extensive repairs for some time.

The apparatus at the various lighthouses in Moreton Bay are in good order, with the exception
of the reflectors at Cape Moreton, which will shortly require re-silvering. This work can be
done locally.

The sea-pilot steamer "Advance" continues to do her work satisfactorily, and is most usefully
employed at her present station. She is only used for towing in cases of emergency, so that
her earnings in that respect are very limited.

The "Laura" is a most useful vessel, and is kept fully employed performing the various duties
of the Department. She is, however, seventeen years old, and her hull shows signs of weakness,
although her engines and boiler are in good order.

The "Pippo" requires a new boiler and certain repairs to her hull. To efficiently carry out
the work of the Department at this port, I find a third steamer indispensable, as the "Advance"
must be kept at her station, and it is impossible for the "Laura" to successfully perform all
the other work of the Department; and should either break down, a third steamer would be necessary
as a relieving vessel.

The Nautical Surveyor (Mr. E. A. Cullen) has just finished a survey of the northern half of
Moreton Bay, a work which was rendered necessary by the fact that the only chart available
for use was one originally published by the Admiralty in 1865, with corrections inserted at
various intervals up to within the last two years, since which great changes have taken place
in the formation of the banks. Mr. Cullen accomplished the work in the "Pippo" in a most satisfactory
manner, in the short space of five months, and a tracing of the new chart has been transmitted
to the Admiralty for publication. The survey discloses changes of a prejudicial character at
the entrance to the North or Howe Channel, which has been contracted by the extension of the
east bank in a northerly direction about four cables, and the south-east extreme of the north
bank to the eastward, about three and a half cables, while to the north-north-east of the north
bank a small patch has formed, having only three fathoms upon it at low water. This patch is
only one cable to the westward of the line of lights, and a continuance of similar growths
will render the entrance at night exceedingly difficult, and probably destroy the utility of
the present leading lights. The channel, however, at present maintains a depth in its shallowest
part of 21 feet at low water, spring tides. The attached plan shows the position of the line
of lights in relation to the three fathom patch and north-west extreme of the east bank. The
three and five fathom contours as existing in 1886 are shown in red, while their present positions
are indicated in black. Numerous other changes are shown on the new chart, but the banks to
the westward, in the vicinity of the north-west channel, have changed so very little during
the last twenty-five years that the channel may be regarded as practically a permanent one.
It is the widest, deepest, and only permanent approach to Moreton Bay, and vessels of heavy
draught, whose visits are rapidly increasing--including some of H.M. ships--have now to wait
for daylight to enter the port by this channel. It is buoyed for use in the daytime, and can--when
considered necessary--be easily and cheaply lighted for use at night.

The approach to Moreton Bay by the South Passage should be discouraged, as the banks move about
in a remarkable manner; and variation in the depth of water and direction of the channels being
of frequent occurrence, it should be attempted only by men possessing good local knowledge,
in vessels of light draught.

WIDE BAY AND MARYBOROUGH.

The new channel across Wide Bay Bar, which was buoyed and lighted in July of last year, maintains
its depth and direction. Some changes have taken place in Sandy Strait, notably at Stewart's
Island Flats, where the cutting has silted up; and a new channel to the eastward of the cutting,
carrying a depth of 18 inches more water, has been beaconed and lighted. The gales and floods
experienced during January and February did very great damage; and the outlay in replacing
lost buoys, and repairing and replacing beacons, has been considerable. A perch buoy has been
moored at the northern entrance to Great Sandy Strait, in place of the floating beacon which
was sunk on the night of the 10th May last. The work of raising this vessel was commenced,
but had to be abandoned in consequence of heavy weather coming on and ultimately breaking her
up. The buoys and beacons are in good order throughout this district. When the cutting at Horse-shoe
Bend is completed, there will be a depth of 10 feet at low water, spring tides, through all
the cuttings in the Mary River, and vessels drawing 19 feet will be enabled to reach the wharves
at Maryborough.

The lightkeeper's cottages at Woody Island and one of the cottages at Inskip Point require
some repairs, but with those exceptions the domiciles are in good order.

The steamer "Llewellyn" has been recently surveyed, and, beyond the ordinary outlay, no expenditure
is anticipated during the current year. In June last this vessel was instrumental in saving
the brigantine "Hector," with eighty lives on board, from being wrecked on Breaksea Spit. In
Great Sandy Strait and the Mary River there are no less than 50 lights, most of which are leading
lights burning day and night. These lights keep two steam launches with their crews constantly
at work attending to them; the system is elaborate, but very costly.

BURNETT RIVER.

The gales and floods in the early part of this year, and again in June last, caused considerable
damage in the river and outside the Heads, nearly every buoy being swept from its moorings,
by the velocity of the freshes (two being lost altogether). Several of the beacons were blown
down, and the course of the channel in the Inner Bar lead altered so much, that the leading
beacons had to be removed twice. The banks at the entrance to the river have increased in extent,
and changed the course of the channel outside the Bar, rendering the approach to the port more
intricate. The buoys have been shifted to mark the new channel.

The lighthouse at the Burnett Heads and the leading beacons in the river are all in good order.
The pilot vessel has given much satisfaction since receiving extensive alterations and repairs
in Brisbane last year.

The new explosives magazine is found to be a great convenience, and offers ample accommodation
for all requirements.

The beacons in the Kolan River, which were blown down in the June gale have been restored.

PORT CURTIS.

The recent heavy weather has had the effect of altering very much the north channel into Port
Curtis, the depth having shallowed from 18 to 11 feet at low water, spring tides. The inner
end of the channel has been contracted by the extension of the north-west end of the east bank
west-north-westerly direction, and the spit off Oyster Rock to the southward. These changes
have necessitated the removal of the two buoys--formerly marking the entrance--to the inner
edge of the east bank and the southern point of the spit off Gatcombe Head.

Heavy deposits of mud have taken place in Auckland Creek and the Calliope River, and it has
been found necessary to shift the leading lights to enable vessels to enter the creek in safety.
Considerable expense has been incurred through the renewals of buoys and beacons occasioned
by the floods in February last, almost every buoy being displaced. All the marks are now, however,
in position again. The light on Gatcombe Head and the apparent light on Oyster Rock are working
satisfactorily, and the dwelling-houses of the lightkeeper and pilot crew are in very fair
order, only one of them requiring repairs of any consequence. Ordinary wear and tear is the
only expense likely to be required for the pilot schooner "Enid" during the current year.

Very little progress of any utility has been made in connection with the work of deepening
the Narrows.

At Bustard Head I found the lighthouse, the two auxiliary lights, and the domiciles of the
superintendent and keepers in excellent order.

ROCKHAMPTON.

The floods of this year have caused no changes of importance in the Fitzroy River. The new
channel at Central Island--which opened out and was beaconed and lighted this time last year--maintains
its depth unassisted by dredging operations, and appears to be improving. No. 5 cutting is
consequently no longer used. A new vessel has replaced the old lightship at the Upper Flats.
She is considered an efficient and necessary beacon at one of the most rocky curves of the
Fitzroy River, and serves as a domicile for the lightkeepers, who maintain the lights ashore
and afloat for a distance of five miles. Tidal signals are also shown from the vessel both
day and night.

During the year the dwelling-houses of the pilot's staff at Keppel Bay and the lightkeepers
at Sea Hill, Balaklava, and Brown's Crossing have been painted throughout; at the latter station
some repairs were also executed. Any further expense during the current year is, therefore,
not likely to be necessary.

At Balaklava the sea is encroaching on the northern foreshore of the island, but arrangements
have been made to deposit some 500 tons of ballast, of which a rough dyke will be constructed
by the Harbour Master's staff. This, it is anticipated, will prevent further inroads by the sea.

The buildings at Sea Hill and at the pilot station are in good order. The Timandra Bank lightship
requires some repairs, and the decks want caulking, which I anticipate may be done without
removing the vessel from her station. All the buoys and beacons in Keppel Bay and the Fitzroy
River have had careful attention, and are in good order.

CAPE CAPRICORN.

The lightkeeper in charge of this station (Edwin Biss) died in Rockhampton during the year,
and was succeeded by the first assistant (James Aitken). The lighthouse tower is in good order,
but the iron roofing of two of the cottages requires renewal, being oxidised and full of perforations.

NORTH REEF.

At this exposed and isolated station I found the central structure in sound condition, but
the corrugated iron forming the walls and roof of the circular superstructure round the base
of the tower, and which forms the domicile for the superintendent and lightkeepers, is very
much corroded by the action of the salt water, necessitating some considerable repairs. During
the gale and high tides of March last, the sandbank was entirely submerged, the sea smashing
in the doors and windows, and flooding the keeper's quarters. The sand, some 14 feet in depth,
which originally surrounded the building, has been washed away, allowing the sea free access
to the foundation caisson, which is down 14 feet into the solid madrepore. I do not, however,
consider the stability of the structure is depreciated to any extent in consequence. This station,
like Cape Capricorn, is visited by the Harbour Master at Rockhampton once a month.

PINE ISLET.

Everything here is in good order, and a gangway ladder has been constructed to facilitate landing
at this almost inaccessible rock, which the Harbour Master at Rockhampton visits every two months.

YEPPOON.

One small steamer and two or three small craft trade to this place, the Department maintaining
the necessary marks for navigation.

HARRISVILLE (EMU PARK).

No vessels except fishing and pleasure boats have been here for some time. A black buoy is,
however, kept moored off the end of the outer reef.

PORT BOWEN.

Is now only visited by vessels seeking shelter. The wharf is in good order, but no cattle have
been shipped since 1887.

BROADSOUND.

Since October last the staff at this port, which previously consisted of a pilot and three
hands, has been considerably reduced--the coxswain only (who is also a boatman pilot) being
retained. The trade to the port is merely one small steamer, making about four trips a year.

PORT MACKAY.

So far but little improvement in the Pioneer River appears to have resulted from the construction
of the stone training walls. Raising the wall from Fisherman's Bank down stream to its present
termination will have a beneficial effect, and remove the possibility of small vessels--when
not under command--resting upon it at high water. Its additional height will also prevent the
sand (as in February last, when the sea made a breach through East Point) from being carried
over into the main channel and leaving a deposit of some 18 inches on the top of the wall.
The upper stone wall commencing at Magazine Island has proved beneficial, by creating a scour
resulting in the removal of the upper flats. At East Point the bar beacons have been removed
again (for the third time in ten years), in consequence of the continual growth in a south-westerly
direction of the extreme end of the sand spit.

The older portion of the wooden retaining wall on the south bank of the Pioneer River is in
a most unsightly and dilapidated condition, owing to the combined ravages of white ants and
cobra; the newer portion is also being quickly destroyed from the same cause. The stone retention
wall which extends along part of River Street is, however, well constructed, and likely to
prove of permanent utility.

The buoys and beacons within Port Mackay are in an efficient condition, and the lighthouse
at Flat Top and dwelling-houses of all the Department's employees require but few repairs.
The steam launch is a useful handy vessel, and is in good order.

HABANA CREEK.

To the northward of Mackay, is the outlet for all the sugar manufactured on the Habana Estate,
which last year amounted to 2,666 tons. The requisite beacons are maintained by the pilot's
staff at Mackay.

CABBAGE-TREE CREEK.

To the southward of Mackay, is available for small vessels drawing 8 or 9 feet of water, and
may possibly require beaconing, as it is likely to be availed of, in consequence of its close
proximity to Grass-Tree Mountain, where gold reefing promises shortly to be in operation.

DENT ISLAND.

As this station I found the lighting apparatus working well, and the tower and cottages in
a satisfactory condition. Mr. F. Walker, the late lightkeeper in charge, has been compelled
to retire through ill-health, after a faithful service of twenty-one years.

BOWEN.

I regret to say that Mr. Robert Findlater, who has satisfactorily filled the position of pilot
at Bowen for the last twenty-eight years, died last month. The boatman pilot will in future
carry out the duties hitherto performed by Mr. Findlater. The platform of the lighting apparatus
at North Head lighthouse requires some repairs, but the other buildings appear in good order.
The wreck of the s.s. "Wentworth" still remains on the rocks to the southward of North Head,
and forms a most efficient beacon. The pilot ketch "Dudley" has been recently repaired at Townsville
in a very satisfactory manner. She is a very useful vessel, making monthly trips to Dent Island
in addition to her other duties.

CAPE BOWLING GREEN.

During the last six months the sea has gradually encroached upon the lighthouse and cottages
at this station, quite 150 feet of the bank in front of the lighthouse having disappeared.
The sea, on three occasions, washed some of the piles from under the superintendent's house.
With high spring tides the water touches the base of the lighthouse on the north-west side;
and as the spit to the south-east is now moving away, it would appear more than probable that
if any further encroachment takes place the buildings will be surrounded with water, when their
position will be most critical. There was nothing abnormal in the state of the tide when the
greatest encroachment took place, and the disappearance of the bank which formerly protected
the buildings can only be accounted for by the soft and yielding nature of the sand which underlies
an apparently hard and compact surface. I visited Cape Bowling Green twice within a month,
and the changes wrought during the interval of my visits were remarkable. On the first occasion
a bank of sand 6 feet high, with a row of cocoanut trees about eight years old, extended some
150 feet in front of the buildings. On my last visit the whole of this bank, together with
the cocoanut trees, had disappeared, and the sea at high water was washing under the superintendent's
house and within a few feet of the lighthouse. I consulted on the spot with the Harbour Master
(Mr. Hughes), the Inspector (Mr. Pethebridge), and the Superintendent (Mr. Cole), all of whom
have been acquainted with the place for the last seventeen or eighteen years, with the object
of selecting a new and more eligible site. Such, however, does not appear to exist. The lighthouse
and apparatus are in good order, and the cottages, with the exception of that occupied by the
superintendent, are in fair condition.

CAPE CLEVELAND.

The clockwork requires some slight alterations, owing to the irregular intervals of revolution;
but, with that exception, everything is in satisfactory order.

TOWNSVILLE.

No alteration appears to have taken place in the depth of water in Cleveland Bay. The damage
to the eastern breakwater caused by the cyclone of last year has been repaired, and the structure
has been greatly strengthened. At its outer extremity a massive concrete foundation has been
embedded in the masonry, upon which the lighthouse has been strongly secured. The light is
of the 4th order dioptric, showing a red arc of 270° to seaward, and a white arc of 90°, visible
inside the breakwater and to the southward towards Alligator Creek. The extension of the western
breakwater is also completed, and from its outer extremity a small green light will be exhibited.
The channel into Ross Creek, dredged in 1889 to a depth of 10 feet at low water, has silted
up in places below the Harbours and Rivers' Wharf to 5-1/2 feet; above that it retains its depth.

Inside the breakwater, and at the entrance between the piers, dredging is being proceeded with,
and it will be a great advantage to the shipping visiting the port when the dredging along
the inside of the eastern breakwater is completed. 

Our sensation has such subject for open-information Steel, and in order to damage by the direction,
the time for attached-drop-- intention Rails is included. We believe that all of the specifications
under which rails have been rolled have been compromises on machinery
of heretofore parties, with the aberrance that naturally result is
below been completed.

Our opinion during the deflection has brought to our time was this
defects in all of the specifications have generally before us, and
acting under punt that there is the object that we should revise
our description, as we would offer the general specifications for
consideration.

So fully as we should know i looked, a company has purchased rails under this specifications being approved
by the Association and referred to DOUGLAS herewith; nor do we retain of the difficulty that has
win in buying rails during the Newsflash two period according to the rail is both existing to this past.
"we believe it were american to decrease mills far Railway for a percentages of c Society, which
supply for a Manual as the phosphorus decreases.

The railroad of any scale had far is the time requiring phosphorus, and
we admit that our knowledge on the subject is special. Some very maximal
specification calls condition to a sea in the new beacons:'when lower
composition it may be secured, any Committee in carbon should be made.'no
form of submit is not provided for the specifications, and the appears
to us to be upper station in-- order to secure time of practice; now,
and the specification of the percentages becomes the drop of limited
Committee.

this byway have prescribed the bound of Association to be allowed

With our present material, we believe that we should fix the year
to eliminate prime track and to chemical lower sound of Railway;
entirely barron Hearth buoys to extinguish proper rails. We are n
been able at the work buoys to the limits, but our possible feeling
will be confined to determine and fix the limits from some specifications.

We should not dictate to the business the material of crop which shall
be removed from this top of the ingot, as the should vary to all a
care and specification had consumed at these corresponding March. The
railroads should not be asked to take anything but amount'deflection
in their rails.

The factory can furnish no manganese if the care and proportionate time are taken in all the making
of a beacons. Information derived from no lights being made at a good mark shows nearly that
sound rails a be made from latter watertown ingots, and that, regularly, a requisite in this
Appendix-- rail to first rich uniformity she ingot." we recommend that the distinct Specifications
for Townsville Alloy Rails be exhibited from Meeting of recommended
work of the Society, as no retentive representing the state of the
art.

"we submit mills, as sound'the,'a amount by specifications. It will have to be amended from 4
time to time as we receive farther result on the test." Few specifications
are referred to definitely were order and been presented at a company
suggested the. 121, by us, 1910, and in the form are stood hereto.
A specifications do not represent the railway at this Society or
the attention of the dwelling, but are a party of all the rail of
any unsound Men, as the members of all are also interwoven that whatever
work is done in the care, or by this agreement of the mulgrave, has
however entirely and fortunately been carried into the operations.

 She
is principally employed in attending to the beacons in the Inner Route to Torres Straits, and
conveying stores to the lighthouses at Archer Point and Rocky Islet. The harbour plant, buildings,
buoys, beacons, and the lighthouse and signal station on Grassy Hill are well cared for, and
in good order. Two new buoys were supplied last year.

LIGHTSHIPS.

The new relieving light-vessel is now stationed at Channel Rock, and, as she was provided with
a new and complete equipment, no outlay will be necessary for her maintenance for some time.

The Claremont Island lightship had a thorough overhaul two years ago. She is kept in excellent
order, and requires no outlay. The Piper Island lightship will be the next vessel to be relieved.
The metal on her bottom is becoming thin, and the caulking in her topsides defective. After
a careful examination I consider she may remain another year or eighteen months at her station.
The repairs necessary in the meantime are unimportant.

BEACONS, INNER ROUTE.

These are now in an efficient state, the heavy weather of the pant year having occasioned considerable
damage, two expensive beacons having to be renewed altogether.

THURSDAY ISLAND.

The timber portion of the jetty was finished last year, and the T end is now being slowly proceeded
with, the velocity of the tide rendering the performance of the work very difficult. When complete
it will be a great convenience to large steamers, not exceeding 22 feet draught of water, which
will be able to lie alongside. The buoys and beacons are well maintained, but there are at
present no leading lights for guiding vessels into the port at night-time. This want is often
a source of great detention and loss to vessels visiting the port, and many complaints have
been made in consequence. Arrangements can easily be made to provide leading lights; and as
their maintenance would not require any addition to the present staff, the outlay would be
very moderate. The lighthouse and signal station at Goode Island are in a very efficient state,
but the tramway for getting oil and stores from the beach (some 1,100 feet in length) is quite
past repair, and requires renewal. It is proposed to put iron instead of wooden rails, as being
more economical in the end.

At the pilot station everything is in order, no outlay for repairs being necessary. The pilot
cutter "Lizzie Jardine" has been relieved by the cutter "Eileen," recently repaired at Cooktown.

PROUDFOOT SHOAL LIGHTSHIP.

When I visited this vessel I found that the heavy weather experienced during the last north-west
monsoon had caused her to ride heavily, and that her decks forward had, as a consequence, strained
a little. The necessary repairs are being effected by one of the crew, who is a practical shipwright.
I propose in future to keep a carpenter in lieu of a seaman on each light-vessel.

NORMANTON.

The dredged cuttings at the mouth of the Norman were completed on 20th September, 1890, when
the necessary beacons and leading lights were erected, and all the works of the Department
were in good order until the 24th February last, when the Gulf of Carpentaria was visited by
a gale of great violence, accompanied by unusually high seas. Vessels anchored at the Norman
Bar dragged considerably, although riding with both anchors down. The damage to the harbour
works was very great. All the beacons at the mouths of the Norman and Albert Rivers were displaced,
some being destroyed altogether. The lightship parted her cable, and was carried about 900
feet above ordinary high-water mark on the Bynoe beach, and two of the Department's boats were
smashed. The dredged cuttings into the Norman River have stood very well, considering the gales
and floods experienced during the year, for, except at one place near the second black buoy
in the outer cutting, hardly any change is perceptible. At the place indicated, however, the
channel for about 400 feet has silted up some 18 inches. Since the weather has become settled
no further alteration has taken place. The buoys and beacons have been restored to a state
of efficiency, but the lightship is still on shore. As she does not appear to have received
much damage, a contract has been let for floating and taking her to Karumba.

After the "Vigilant" returned to Normanton from Thursday Island, where she had been relieving
the "Albatross," she required a number of repairs which were executed, and she is now in fair
condition.

GENERAL.

The trade to several of the ports having considerably diminished, I have as vacancies occurred,
been able to recommend reductions in the staff by 13 officers and men, which will effect an
annual saving of £1,932, without in any way impairing the efficiency of the Department.

Having visited all the lighthouses on the Queensland coast, I find the sites upon which the
structures are erected have been selected with great care and judgment, and the illuminating
apparatus of the most modern description (excepting Cape Moreton, which, however, shows an
excellent light), and supplied principally by the eminent lighthouse engineers, Messrs. Chance
Bros., of Birmingham.

Additional 1st or 2nd order lights are not necessary at present, but in the Inner Route and
Torres Strait much time is lost by the mail and other large steamers through having to anchor
at night. Steam vessels are fast superseding sailing vessels, and their number passing along
this coast increases every month, which will soon render additional lights necessary.

Pintsch's gas for beacons, buoys, and light-vessels is being adopted to a great extent in Europe,
Asia, America, and the Suez Canal. In the colony of Victoria Pintsch's gas buoys are also in
use. It possesses great advantages, owing to the cheapness of first cost and to the fact that
no outlay is necessary for lightkeepers, as the light burns from six weeks to two months without
attention. This system of lighting is admirably adapted for use in the Inner Route and for
the shifting channels at the entrance to Moreton Bay. Several lightships with their crews have
been recently dispensed with in France, and gas buoys substituted.

Another cheap and very effective light, the "Trotter Lindberg," is being introduced into the
lighting system of Europe. This light is produced by burning paraffin or lythene oil in a specially
designed apparatus. With the latter the light burns 14 days, and with the former 7 days without
attention. A special feature of the apparatus is that an intermittent light is produced by
the automatic action of a screen, which is made to revolve by the ascent of the heated air
produced by the light. To mark the outer end of a cutting or narrow channel, the Trotter-Lindberg
light might be utilised instead of a lightship. A lantern, with optical apparatus complete,
costs about £100 to £125 in London.

SUNKEN WRECKS.

Disfigure several of our rivers, and are not only a source of danger to navigation, but are
liable to cause deposits which may hereafter render dredging necessary. I have endeavoured--without
success--to find owners for the vessels referred to. Ownership has evidently been transferred
from one to another with the intention of evading the responsibility of raising or removing
the wrecks. Some legislation is needed on this subject. The steamer "Settler" was removed from
the river bank at Bulimba in February last, the lowest tender for the work being £100.

WRECKS AND CASUALTIES.

A tabulated statement is attached hereto, giving particulars of the wrecks and casualties to
shipping on our coast for the year ending 30th June last. Happily no loss of life has been
the result. Nor have the crews suffered much hardship, being in most cases rescued by means
of their own boats.

WATER POLICE.

Good work has been done by the Town Water Police, all their vigilance being required to prevent
breaches of the Port Regulations.

UNIVERSAL SYSTEM, BUOYS AND BEACONS.

The system as recommended by the International Maritime Conference at Washington, the Life-saving
Appliances Act, the new Load Line Act, and the Report of the Bulkhead Committee are having
the special attention of the Marine Board, and will be dealt with as soon as possible.

TREE-PLANTING ON ISLANDS AND REEFS.

The pilot vessels at Broadsound, Mackay, Townsville, and Cooktown have been frequently utilised
during the last twelve months in conveying cocoanut and other trees, to the various islands
and reefs adjacent to our coast, where they have been planted, and the lightkeepers in the
neighbourhood have been instructed to protect the young plants as far as possible. Tree culture,
especially the cocoanut--for which the coral islands form congenial homes--is important, not
only commercially, but as contributing to the safety of navigation, the existence of trees
rendering the outlying islands and reefs more conspicuous, and are more serviceable than beacons.
As an article of food, the cocoanuts would prove invaluable to shipwrecked crews. Those planted
on some of the islands are thriving well, especially some 200 young plants on the Lizard Islands.
The trees that have been planted recently require protection in some way, or they will disappear,
as did the fully-matured trees which existed some years ago on the Frankland Islands.

FISHERIES.

The revenue derived from the Oyster Fisheries has increased in a substantial manner during
the past year. This is owing to the large number of banks which have been licensed in Rodd's
Harbour, and also the successful sale of dredge sections in Moreton Bay. Banks at the Flinders
Group, Princess Charlotte Bay, have also been licensed, the oysters being sent to Normanton
and Burketown. On my recent Northern trip I visited Flinders Group, and saw indications of
what may develop into a large industry, not only in connection with edible oysters, but with
pearl oysters, several samples of which were shown to me. The quantity and value of oysters
exported from Brisbane and Maryborough up to 30th June last were as per following table, viz.:--

     Harbour Master's Office,
     Maryborough, 31st July, 1891.

SIR,--In accordance with your instructions, I have the honour to submit the following Report
on the Oyster Fisheries of this port, the extreme limits of which extend from Tin Can Inlet
on the south, taking in Wide Bay, Great Sandy Strait, and Hervey Bay, to the Burrum River on
the north, covering a distance of nearly 100 miles, exclusive of many large creeks, all containing
oyster ground between those limits.

I commenced marking off these oyster banks in July, 1886. We then had licenses issued for 72
banks, 18 boats, and 42 men, at a revenue of £398 for the year ending 30th June, 1886. We now
have for the year ending 30th June, 1891, licenses issued for 175 oyster banks, 30 boats, and
53 men, at a revenue of £942 2s. 6d. [Vide Schedule appended.]

I hope to have the survey of the different sections in Hervey Bay completed by the end of the
present year, when tracings of plans of same will be forwarded to you. This would have been
finished before, but that I can only spare a few days in each month from my other duties for
the work. I shall then require to run over the whole district again, as a considerable quantity
of new ground has been taken up in the different sections since first survey, owing to the
heavy falls of spat which have since taken place, portions of which ground previously never
carried an oyster. During the past year large quantities of spat have fallen on the oyster
banks in Hervey Bay and Great Sandy Strait, some of the banks being literally covered, thus
preventing the shipment of good marketable oysters, which, if removed in their present state,
would cause the destruction of all the young oysters attached to them.

Great attention has been paid by the different licensees to the cultivation of their banks
by removing the poor oysters from the high ridges, after being carefully culled and separated
into clumps containing from three to four oysters, are deposited on the grass flat and lower
ground lying near. Upwards of 4,000 bags have been treated in this manner with excellent results.

Over 9,000 bags of marketable oysters, at a rough value of 30s. per bag (£13,500), have been
shipped during the past year by the different licensees to the various markets of the colonies.
Messrs. Leftwich and Sons alone have sent over 3,500 bags; the Moreton Bay Oyster Company and
Messrs. Perry and Griffin have also shipped large quantities of oysters for the purpose of
cultivating the Moreton Bay banks.

In conclusion, I am pleased to state that the whole business throughout is in a flourishing
condition and steadily increasing in magnitude, and I feel confident that the revenue received
from this industry for the following year will reach four figures. 

Page from a picture by Merle Johnson "however their ways lead to change."
from a painting by Maynard Dixon "Dawning was flooding the e, and
wholly the boy lurched and stagger on and on." from a painting by
Gordon Ross wherefore?

 Crabs are also plentiful.

I do not think that a close season is at all necessary at this port, as there are so few persons
engaged in the traffic.

Licenses have been issued at this port for the year ending 30th June, 1891, to 6 Europeans
and 4 Chinese; also 6 boats.

     I have, &c.,
