There was now nothing to be done but to wait till the shower was over, and by that time I found
it would be impossible for me to go to Kettleness without seeming deliberately to avoid the
service.

The sun came out, and the sky was quite blue before eleven o'clock, and the fishermen spread
tarpaulins on the sand for the congregation to sit on, and I found myself--I must say very
much against my will--being led to the place by little Jack.

 Your conscience pulls, your
good old mother pulls, your little child pulls, your Christian mate pulls; each sermon you
hear, each Bible class you attend, each hymn you sing, each prayer uttered in your presence,
each striving of the Spirit, each God-given yearning after better things, each storm you come
through, each danger you escape, each sickness in your family, each death in your home, each
deliverance granted you, gives you a pull God-ward, Christ-ward, heaven-ward.

'Yet, oh, my dear friend, you know, as clearly as you know that you are sitting there, that,
so far, Christ's pullers are drawing in vain. You have never yet, you know it, crossed the
line which divides the saved from the unsaved. Why is this? Why, oh, why are you so hard to move?

'Oh, my friend, do you ask why? Surely you know the reason! Is it not because there are other
hands on the rope, other pullers drawing in an exactly opposite direction? For Satan has many
an agent, many a servant, and he sends forth a great army of soul-pullers. Each worldly friend,
each desire of your evil nature, each temptation to sin, each longing after wealth, each sinful
suggestion, gives you a pull, and a pull the wrong way, away from safety, away from Christ,
away from God, away from heaven, away from Home. And towards what? Oh, dear friend, towards
what? What are the depths, the fearful depths towards which you are being drawn?'

He said a good deal more, but I did not hear it. That question seemed burnt in with a red-hot
iron into my soul. What are the depths, the fearful depths into which you are being drawn?
I could not shake it off. I wished I could get away from the green, but Jack had brought me
close to the boat where the choir stood, and there was no escape. I should have to sit it out;
it would soon be over, I said to myself.

The service ended with a hymn. Another of their queer, wild, irregular tunes, I thought; I
was not going to sing it. But when Jack saw that I did not open my book, he leant over the
side of the boat, and poked my head with his hymn-book. 'Sing, big Mr. Jack, sing,' he said
aloud, and then, for very shame, I had to find my place and begin. I can still remember the
first verse of that hymn, and I think I can recall the tune to which they sang it:--

  'Oh, tender and sweet was the Master's voice,
    As he lovingly called to me:
  "Come over the line! it is only a step--
    I am waiting, My child, for thee!" But I was not so successful as
I had been the Sunday before. That question followed me; the very waves
seemed to be repeating it. What are the depths, the fearful depths, to
which you are being drawn? I had not looked at it in that light before.
I had been quite willing to own that I was not religious, that I was
leading a gay, easy-going kind of life, that my Sundays were spent in
bed, or in novel reading, or in rowing, or in some other amusement. I
was well aware that I looked at these things very differently from what
my mother had done, and I had even wondered sometimes, whether, if she
had been spared to me, I should have been a better fellow than I knew
myself to be. But as for feeling any real alarm or anxiety with regard
to my condition, such a thought had never for one moment crossed my
mind.

Yet if this man was right, there was real danger in my position. I was not remaining stationary,
as I had thought, but I was being drawn by unseen forces towards something worse, towards the
depths, the fearful depths, of which he had spoken.

'What then?' he said; 'what troubles you, Jack?'

'It's the thought that I shall never see her again,' I said; 'I know I shall not. She went
one way and I am going another.'

'Why not turn round and go her way, Jack?' he said cheerily.
