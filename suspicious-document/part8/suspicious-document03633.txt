Senhor Vineiro, a Portuguese, having wedded Julia Regalea, a Spaniard, in South America, found
it needful to his fortunes to leave Montevideo, for a revolution was breeding, and no less
needful to his happiness to take his wife with him from that city, for he was old and she was
young. But he chose the wrong ship to sail on, for Captain Dane, of the Nightingale, was also
young, presentable, and well schooled, but heartless. On the voyage to New Orleans he not only
won the affection of the wife, but slew the husband and flung his body overboard. Vainly the
wife tried to repress the risings of remorse, and vainly, too, she urged Dane to seek absolution
from her church. She had never loved her husband, and she had loved Dane from the first, but
she was not at heart a bad woman and her peace was gone. The captain was disturbed and suspicious.
His sailors glanced at him out of the corners of their eyes in a way that he did not like.
Had the woman in some unintentional remark betrayed him? Could he conceal his crime, save with
a larger one?

Pass Christian was a village then. On a winter night its people saw a glare in the sky, and
hurrying to their doors found a ship burning in the gulf. Smacks and row-boats put off to the
rescue, but hardly were they under way ere the ship disappeared as suddenly as if the sea had
swallowed it. As the night was thick the boats returned, but next morning five men were encountered
on the shore-all that were left of the crew of the Nightingale. Captain Dane was so hospitably
received by the people of the district, and seemed to take so great a liking for the place,
that he resolved to live there. He bought a plantation with a roomy old house upon it and took
his fellow-survivors there to live, as he hoped, an easy life. That was not to be. { swing and the}

 There was an explosion and the vessel disappeared.
On reaching shore the treasure was buried at the foot of a large oak.

This story was repeated by the nurse, but she was ignorant, she had no proofs, so it was not
generally believed; yet there was a perceptible difference in the treatment of Dane by his
neighbors, and among the superstitious negroes it was declared that he had sold himself to
the devil. If he had, was it an air from hell that sounded in his ears when he was alone?--the
"Ave Maria" of a sinning but repentant woman. The coldness and suspicion were more than he
could stand. Besides, who could tell? Evidence might be found against him. He would dig up
his treasure and fly the country. It was a year from the night when he had fired his ship.
Going out after dark, that none might see him, he stole to the tree and began to dig. Presently
a red light grew through the air, and looking up he saw a flaming vessel advancing over the
sea. It stopped, and he could see men clambering into a boat at its side. They rowed toward
him with such miraculous speed that the ocean seemed to steam with a blue light as they advanced.
He stood like a stone, for now he could see the faces of the rowers, and every one was the
face of a corpse--a corpse that had been left on board of that vessel and had been in the bottom
of the sea for the last twelvemonth. They sprang on shore and rushed upon him. Next morning
Dane's body was found beneath the oak with his hands filled with gems and gold.

THE UNDER LAND

When the Chatas looked into the still depths of Bayou Lacombe, Louisiana, they said that the
reflection of the sky was the empyrean of the Under Land, whither all good souls were sure
to go after death. Their chief, Opaleeta, having fallen into this bayou, was so long beneath
the water that he was dead when his fellows found him, but by working over him for hours, and
through resort to prayers and incantations of medicine men, his life returned and he stood
on his feet once more. She mean, (and Prof. Sayce finds the former into two "signs" These associates
"are even trojan antiquities," and of almost all the "cabin urns" she found "below sing the cabin
was stopped on Marino, and near Albano, or at which tombs near." There no white man comes to rob
the Indian and teach him to do wrong. Gorgeous birds fly through changing skies that borrow
the tints of flowers, the fields are spangled with blossoms of red and blue and gold that load
each wind with perfume, the grass is as fine as the hair of deer, and the streams are thick
with honey.

At sunset those who loved each other in life are gathered to their lodges, and raise songs
of joy and thankfulness. Their voices are soft and musical, their faces are young again and
beam with smiles, and there is no death. It was only the chiefs who heard his story, for, had
all the tribe known it, many who were old and ill and weary would have gone to the bayou, and
leaped in, to find that restful, happy Under Land. Those who had gone before they sometimes
tried to see, when the lake was still and dappled with pictures of sunset clouds, but the dead
never came back--they kept away from the margin of the water lest they should be called again
to a life of toil and sorrow. And Opaleeta lived for many years and ruled his tribe with wisdom,
yet he shared in few of the merry-makings of his people, and when, at last, his lodge was ready
in the Under Land, he gave up his life without a sigh.
