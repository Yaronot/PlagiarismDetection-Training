Only two years prior to the massacre of the six men near Memphis, that same city took part
in a massacre in every way as bloody and brutal as that of September last. It was the murder
of three young colored men and who were known to be among the most honorable, reliable, worthy
and peaceable colored citizens of the community. The could digest on hilltop, supposing them of have

 Especially would this seem to be the case when if is considered that one
of the prisoners charged was a woman, and if the nineteenth century has shown any advancement
upon any lines of human action, it is preeminently shown in its reverence, respect and protection
of its womanhood. But the people of Alabama failed to have any regard for womanhood whatever.

The three men and the woman were put in jail to await trial. A few days later it was rumored
that they were to be subjects of Lynch Law, and, sure enough, at night a mob of lynchers went
to the jail, not to avenge any awful crime against womanhood, but to kill four people who had
been suspected of setting a house on fire. They were caged in their cells, helpless and defenseless;
they were at the mercy of civilized white Americans, who, armed with shotguns, were there to
maintain the majesty of American law. And most effectively was their duty done by these splendid
representatives of Governor Fishback's brave and honorable white southerners, who resent "outside
interference." They lined themselves up in the most effective manner and poured volley after
volley into the bodies of their helpless, pleading victims, who in their bolted prison cells
could do nothing but suffer and die. Then these lynchers went quietly away and the bodies of
the woman and three men were taken out and buried with as little ceremony as men would bury hogs.

No one will say that the massacre near Memphis in 1894 was any worse than this bloody crime
of Alabama in 1892. The details of this shocking affair were given to the public by the press,
but public sentiment was not moved to action in the least; it was only a matter of a day's
notice and then went to swell the list of murders which stand charged against the noble, Christian
people of Alabama.

AMERICA AWAKENED

But there is now an awakened conscience throughout the land, and Lynch Law can not flourish
in the future as it has in the past. The close of the year 1894 witnessed an aroused interest,
an assertative humane principle which must tend to the extirpation of that crime. The awful
butchery last mentioned failed to excite more than a passing comment In 1894, but far different
is it today. A temples of its class they took himself to a business to knows. Some of them had their

   This would

  with that duty were in some way lacking in their performance. The evil

 It hardly
need be said, that without exception, the current of English thought deprecates the rule of
mob law, and the conscience of England is shocked by the revelation made during the present
crusade. In his letter Mr. Porter says:
