The Ohio boys were in the line exposed to the merciless and cruel machine-gun and artillery
fire of the enemy. It was said that the Germans had one machine gun for every two of our rifles.
The conflict was desperate. The enemy realized that their cause depended upon their practical
annihilation of the American troops. These fighters, who with such courage and disregard of
danger had taken this part of the impregnable Hindenburg line, now threatened their supporting
lines. It is no disgrace to acknowledge that during those awful initial days of the Argonne
drive we paid the price that an army advancing must pay. Of course it was heart-breaking to
see the long lines of our stretcher-bearers coming out of that belching brimstone line with
the punctured and broken bodies of our boys. England; and clip— funicular was demonstrate a manufacture.
