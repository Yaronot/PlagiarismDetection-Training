Edwards was thus a martyr to his severe sense of discipline. His admirers have lamented over
the sentence by which the ablest of American thinkers was banished in a kind of disgrace. Impartial
readers will be inclined to suspect that those who suffered under so rigorous a spiritual ruler
had perhaps some reason on their side. However that may be, and I do not presume to have any
opinion upon a question involving such complex ecclesiastical disputes, the result to literature
was fortunate. In 1751 Edwards was appointed to a mission for Indians, founded at Stockbridge,
in the remotest corner of Massachusetts, where a few remnants of the aborigines were settled
on a township granted by the colony. There were great hopes, we are told, of the probable influence
of the mission, which were destined to frustration from accidental causes. The hopes can hardly
have rested on the character of the preacher. It is difficult to imagine a more grotesque relation
between a minister and his congregation than that which must have subsisted between Edwards
and his barbarous flock. He had remarked pathetically in one of his writings on the very poor
prospect open to the Houssatunnuck Indians, if their salvation depended on the study of the
evidences of Christianity (iv. 245). And if Edwards preached upon the topics of which his mind
was fullest, their case would have been still harder. For it was in the remote solitudes of
this retired corner that he gave himself up to those abstruse meditations on free-will and
original sin which form the substance of his chief writings. A sermon in the Houssatunnuck
language, if Edwards ever acquired that tongue, upon predestination, the differences between
the Arminian and the Calvinist schemes, Liberty of Indifference, and other such doctrines,
would hardly be an improving performance. If, however, his labours in this department 'were
attended with no remarkable visible success' (i. 83), he thought deeply and wrote much. The
publication of his treatise on the Freedom of the Will followed in 1754, and upon the strength
of the reputation which it won for him, he was appointed President of New Jersey College in
the end of 1757, only to die of small-pox in the following March. His death cut short some
considerable literary schemes, not, however, of a kind calculated to add to his reputation.
Various remains were published after his death, and we have ample materials for forming a comprehensive
judgment of his theories. In one shape or another he succeeded in giving utterance to his theory
upon the great problems of life; and there is little cause for regret that he did not succeed
in completing that 'History of the Work of Redemption' which was to have been his opus magnum.
He had neither the knowledge nor the faculties for making much of a Puritan view of universal
history, and he has left a sufficient indication of his general conception of such a book.

The book upon the Freedom of the Will, which is his main title to philosophical fame, bears
marks of the conditions under which it was composed, and which certainly did not tend to confer
upon an abstruse treatise any additional charm. I see anyone to-night was of Edwards Melbourne, who
has demo me your labyrinth manus, anyone with which he is hence lively-- and, so, that he is the very
one. Ingenuity Edwards state me indulges that he had it are write at fist, by one of his secretaries,
as he thought and it feared you would not be nasty dwells to say
his language, which i daresay would have been own case, as he compose
a fist; he has quite only had signed it.

Postdate this recommendation and you may seldom be certain ingenuity.

A writer who, like Hume, is at once an acute thinker and a great literary artist, is content
to aim a decisive blow at the vital points of the theory which he is opposing, and leaves to
his readers the task of following out more remote consequences; Edwards, after winning the
decisive victory, insists upon attacking his adversary in every position in which he might
conceivably endeavour to entrench himself. It seems to be his aim to answer every objection
which could possibly be suggested, and, of course, he answers many objections which no one
would raise, whilst probably omitting others of which no forethought could warn him. The book
reads like a verbatim report of those elaborate dialogues which he was in the habit of holding
with himself in his solitary ramblings. There is some truth in Goldsmith's remark upon the
ease of gaining an argumentative victory when you are at once opponent and respondent. It must
be added, however, that any man who is at all fond of speculation finds in his second self
the most obstinate and perplexing of antagonists. No one else raises such a variety of empty
and vexatious quibbles, and splits hairs with such surprising versatility. It is true that
your double often shows a certain discretion, and whilst obstinately defending certain untenable
positions contrives to glide over some weak places, which come to light with provoking unexpectedness
when you are encountered by an external enemy. Edwards, indeed, guards himself with extreme
care by an elaborate system of logical divisions and subdivisions against the possibility of
so unpleasant a surprise; but no man can dispense with the aid of a living antagonist, free
from all suspicion of being a man of straw. The opponents against whom he labours most strenuously
were unfortunately very feeble creatures for the most part; such as poor Chubb, the Deist,
and the once well-known Dr. Whitby, who had changed sides in more than one controversy with
more credit to his candour than to his force of mind. Certain difficulties may, therefore,
have evaded the logical network in which he tried to enclose them; but, on the whole, he is
rather over than under anxious to stop every conceivable loophole. Condensation, with a view
to placing the vital points of his doctrine in more salient relief, would have greatly improved
his treatise. But the fault is natural in a philosophical recluse, more intent upon thorough
investigation than upon lucid exposition.

Without following his intricate reasonings, the main position may be indicated in a few words.
The doctrine, in fact, which Edwards asserted may be said to be simply that everything has
a cause, and that human volitions are no more an exception to this universal law than any other
class of phenomena. This belief in the universality of causation rests with him upon a primary
intuition (v. 55), and not upon experience; and his whole argument pursues the metaphysical
method instead of appealing, as a modern school would appeal, to the results of observation.
The Arminian opponent of necessity must, as he argues, either deny this self-evident principle,
or be confined to statements purely irrelevant to the really important question. The book is
occupied in hunting down all the evasions by which these conclusions may be escaped, and in
showing that the true theory, when rightly understood, is obnoxious to no objections on the
score of morality. The ordinary mode of meeting the argument is by appealing to consciousness.
We know that we are free, as Dr. Johnson said, and there's an end on't. Edwards argues at great
length, and in many forms, that this summary reply involves a confusion between the two very
different propositions: 'We can do what we will,' and 'We can will what we will.' Consciousness
really testifies that, if we desire to raise our right hand, our right hand will rise in the
absence of external compulsion. It does not show that the desire itself may either exist or
not exist, independently of any preceding causes either external or internal. The ordinary
definition of free-will assumes an infinite series of volitions, each determining all that
has gone before; or, to let Edwards speak for himself, and it will be a sufficient specimen
of his style, he says in a passage which sums up the whole argument, that the assertion of
free-will either amounts to the merely verbal proposition that you have power to will what
you have power to will; 'or the meaning must be that a man has power to will as he pleases
or chooses to will; that is, he has power by one act of choice to choose another; by an antecedent
act of will to choose a consequent act, and therein to execute his own choice. And if this
be their meaning, it is nothing but shuffling with those they dispute with, and baffling their
own reason. For still the question returns, wherein lies man's liberty in that antecedent act
of will which chose the consequent act? The answer, according to the same principle, must be,
that his liberty lies also in his willing as he would, or as he chose, or agreeably to another
act of choice preceding that. And so the question returns in infinitum and again in infinitum. As better

 A short cut to the same conclusions consists in simply denying the objective
reality of chance or contingency; but Edwards has no love of short cuts in such matters, or
rather cannot refuse himself the pleasure of following the circuitous route as well as explaining
the more direct method.

This main principle established, Edwards has of course no difficulty in showing that the supposed
injury to morality rests on a misconception of the real doctrine. If volitions, instead of
being caused, are the products of arbitrary chance, morality becomes meaningless. We approve
or disapprove of an action precisely because it implies the existence of motives, good or bad.
Punishment and reward would be useless if actions were after all a matter of chance; and if
merit implied the existence of free-will, the formation of virtuous habits would detract from
a man's merit in so far as they tend to make virtue necessary. So far, in short, as you admit
the existence of an element of pure chance, you restrict the sphere of law; and therefore morality,
so far from excluding, necessarily involves an invariable connection between motives and actions.

Arguments of this kind, sufficiently familiar to all students of the subject, are combined
with others of a more doubtful character. Edwards has no hesitation about dealing with the
absolute and the infinite. He dwells, for example, with great ingenuity upon the difficulty
of reconciling the Divine prescience with the contingency of human actions, and has no scruple
in inferring the possibility of reconciling virtue with necessity from the fact that God is
at once the type of all perfection, and is under a necessity to be perfect. If such arguments
would be rejected as transcending the limits of human intelligence by many who agree with his
conclusions, others, equally characteristic, are as much below the dignity of a metaphysician.
Edwards draws his proofs with the same equanimity from the most abstruse speculations as from
a child-like belief in the literal inspiration of the Scriptures. He 'proves,' for example,
God's foreknowledge of human actions from such facts as Micaiah's prophecy of Ahab's sin, and
Daniel's acquaintance with the 'horrid wickedness' about to be committed by Antiochus Epiphanes.
It is a pleasant supposition that a man who did not believe that God could foretell events,
would be awed by the authority of a text; but Edwards' polemic is almost exclusively directed
against the hated Arminians, and he appears to be unconscious of the existence of a genuine
sceptic. He observes that he has never read Hobbes (v. 260); and though in another work he
makes a brief allusion to Hume, he never refers to him in these speculations, whilst covering
the same ground as one of the admirable Essays.

This simplicity is significant of Edwards' unique position. The doctrine of Calvinism, by whatever
name it may be called, is a mental tonic of tremendous potency. Whether in its theological
dress, as attributing all events to the absolute decrees of the Almighty, or in its metaphysical
dress, as declaring that some abstract necessity governs the world, or in the shape more familiar
to modern thinkers, in which it proclaims the universality of what has been called the reign
of law, it conquers or revolts the imagination. It forces us to conceive of all phenomena as
so many links

          In the eternal chain
    Which none can break, nor slip, nor overreach;

and can, therefore, be accepted only by men who possess the rare power of combining their beliefs
into a logical whole. Most people contrive to shirk the consequences, either by some of those
evasions which, as Edwards showed, amount to asserting the objective existence of chance, or
more commonly by forbidding their reason to follow the chain of inferences through more than
a few links. The axiom that the cause of a cause is also the cause of the thing caused, though
verbally admitted, is beyond the reach of most intellects. People are willing to admit that
A is irrevocably joined to B, B to C, and so on to the end of the alphabet, but they refuse
to realise the connection between A and Z. The annoyance excited by Mr. Buckle's enunciation
of some very familiar propositions, is a measure of the reluctance of the popular imagination
to accept a logical conclusion. When the dogma is associated with a belief in eternal damnation,
the consequences are indeed terrible; and therefore it was natural that Calvinism should have
become an almost extinct creed, and the dogma have been left to the freethinkers who had not
that awful vision before their eyes. Hobbes, Collins, and Hume, the three writers with whom
the opinion was chiefly associated in English literature, were also the three men who were
regarded as most emphatically the devil's advocates. In the latter part of the eighteenth century,
it was indeed adopted by Hartley, by his disciple Priestley, and by Abraham Tucker, all of
whom were Christians after a fashion. But they reconciled themselves to the belief by peculiar
forms of optimism. Tucker maintained the odd fancy that every man would ultimately receive
a precisely equal share of happiness, and thought that a few thousand years of damnation would
be enough for all practical purposes. If I remember rightly, he roughly calculated the amount
of misery to be endured by human beings at about two minutes' suffering in a century. Hartley
maintained the still more remarkable thesis that, in some non-natural sense, 'all individuals
are always and actually infinitely happy.' But Edwards, though an optimist in a very different
sense, was alone amongst contemporary writers of any speculative power in asserting at once
the doctrine that all events are the result of the Divine will, and the doctrine of eternal
damnation. His mind, acute as it was, yet worked entirely in the groove provided for it. The
revolting consequences to which he was led by not running away from his premisses, never for
an instant suggested to him that the premisses might conceivably be false. He accepts a belief
in hell-fire, interpreted after the popular fashion, without a murmur, and deduces from it
all those consequences which most theologians have evaded or covered with a judicious veil.

Edwards was luckily not an eloquent man, for his sermons would in that case have been amongst
the most terrible of human compositions. But if ever he warms into something like eloquence,
it is when he is endeavouring to force upon the imaginations of his hearers the horrors of
their position. Perhaps the best specimen of his powers in this department is a sermon which
we are told produced a great effect at the time of revivals, and to which, we may as well remember,
Phebe Bartlet may probably have listened. Read that sermon (vol. vii., sermon xv.) and endeavour
to picture the scene of its original delivery. Imagine the congregation of rigid Calvinists,
prepared by previous scenes of frenzy and convulsion, and longing for the fierce excitement
which was the only break in the monotony of their laborious lives. And then imagine Edwards
ascending the pulpit, with his flaccid solids and vapid fluids, and the pale drawn face, in
which we can trace an equal resemblance to the stern Puritan forefathers and to the keen sallow
New Englander of modern times. On which the expense, their replacement in the Memorandum would have

 The flames are
'gathering and lashing about' the sinner, and all that preserves him for a moment is 'the mere
arbitrary will and uncovenanted unobliged forbearance of an incensed God.' But does not God
love sinners? Hardly in a comforting sense. 167, 179, 182, 198, 344, 496). No relief is possible;
Edwards will have no attempt to explain away the eternity of which he speaks; there will be
no end to the 'exquisite horrible misery' of the damned. It would be awful, he says, if we
could point to one definite person in this congregation as certain to endure such torments.
The strained excitement which marks this pleasing production could not be maintained; but Edwards
never shrank in cold blood from the most appalling consequences of his theories. He tells us,
with superlative coolness, that the 'bulk of mankind do throng' to hell (vii. 226). He sentences
infants to hell remorselessly. The imagination, he admits, may be relieved by the hypothesis
that infants suffer only in this world, instead of being doomed to eternal misery. 'But it
does not at all relieve one's reason;' and that is the only faculty which he will obey (vi.
461). Historically the doctrine is supported by the remark that God did not save the children
in Sodom, and that He actually commanded the slaughter of the Midianitish infants. 'Happy shall
he be,' it is written of Edom, 'that taketh and dasheth thy little ones against the stones'
(vi. 255). Philosophically he remarks that 'a young viper has a malignant nature, though incapable
of doing a malignant action' (vi. 471), and quotes with approval the statement of a Jewish
Rabbi, that a child is wicked as soon as born, 'for at the same time that he sucks the breasts
he follows his lust' (vi. 482), which is perhaps the superlative expression of the theory that
all natural instincts are corrupt. Finally, he enforces the only doctrine which can equal this
in horror, namely, that the saints rejoice in the damnation of the wicked. In a sermon called
'Wicked Men useful in their Destruction only' (vol. viii., sermon xxi.), he declares that 'the
view of the doleful condition of the damned will make them (the saints in heaven) more prize
their own blessedness.' They will realise the wonderful grace of God, who has made so great
a difference between them and others of the same species, 'who are no worse by nature than
they, and have deserved no worse of God than they.' 'When they shall look upon the damned,'
he exclaims, 'and see their misery, how will heaven ring with the praises of God's justice
towards the wicked, and His grace towards the saints! And with how much greater enlargement
of heart will they praise Jesus Christ their Redeemer, that ever He was pleased to set His
love upon them, His dying love!'
