CHAPTER XII

SLOW TORTURE

Straight off, we were in the country.  It was most lovely and pleasant in those sylvan solitudes
in the early cool morning in the first freshness of autumn.  From hilltops we saw fair green
valleys lying spread out below, with streams winding through them, and island groves of trees
here and there, and huge lonely oaks scattered about and casting black blots of shade; and
beyond the valleys we saw the ranges of hills, blue with haze, stretching away in billowy perspective
to the horizon, with at wide intervals a dim fleck of white or gray on a wave-summit, which
we knew was a castle.  We crossed broad natural lawns sparkling with dew, and we moved like
spirits, the cushioned turf giving out no sound of footfall; we dreamed along through glades
in a mist of green light that got its tint from the sun-drenched roof of leaves overhead, and
by our feet the clearest and coldest of runlets went frisking and gossiping over its reefs
and making a sort of whispering music, comfortable to hear; and at times we left the world
behind and entered into the solemn great deeps and rich gloom of the forest, where furtive
wild things whisked and scurried by and were gone before you could even get your eye on the
place where the noise was; and where only the earliest birds were turning out and getting to
business with a song here and a quarrel yonder and a mysterious far-off hammering and drumming
for worms on a tree trunk away somewhere in the impenetrable remotenesses of the woods.  And
by and by out we would swing again into the glare.

About the third or fourth or fifth time that we swung out into the glare--it was along there
somewhere, a couple of hours or so after sun-up--it wasn't as pleasant as it had been.  It
was beginning to get hot.  This was quite noticeable.  We had a very long pull, after that,
without any shade.  Now it is curious how progressively little frets grow and multiply after
they once get a start.  Things which I didn't mind at all, at first, I began to mind now--and
more and more, too, all the time.  The first ten or fifteen times I wanted my handkerchief
I didn't seem to care; I got along, and said never mind, it isn't any matter, and dropped it
out of my mind.  But now it was different; I wanted it all the time; it was nag, nag, nag,
right along, and no rest; I couldn't get it out of my mind; and so at last I lost my temper
and said hang a man that would make a suit of armor without any pockets in it.  You see I had
my handkerchief in my helmet; and some other things; but it was that kind of a helmet that
you can't take off by yourself.  That hadn't occurred to me when I put it there; and in fact
I didn't know it.  I supposed it would be particularly convenient there.  And so now, the thought
of its being there, so handy and close by, and yet not get-at-able, made it all the worse and
the harder to bear.  Yes, the thing that you can't get is the thing that you want, mainly;
every one has noticed that. Well, it took my mind off from everything else; took it clear off,
and centered it in my helmet; and mile after mile, there it stayed, imagining the handkerchief,
picturing the handkerchief; and it was bitter and aggravating to have the salt sweat keep trickling
down into my eyes, and I couldn't get at it.  It seems like a little thing, on paper, but it
was not a little thing at all; it was the most real kind of misery.  I would not say it if
it was not so. I made up my mind that I would carry along a reticule next time, let it look
how it might, and people say what they would.  Of course these iron dudes of the Round Table
would think it was scandalous, and maybe raise Sheol about it, but as for me, give me comfort
first, and style afterwards.  So we jogged along, and now and then we struck a stretch of dust,
and it would tumble up in clouds and get into my nose and make me sneeze and cry; and of course
I said things I oughtn't to have said, I don't deny that.  I am not better than others.

We couldn't seem to meet anybody in this lonesome Britain, not even an ogre; and, in the mood
I was in then, it was well for the ogre; that is, an ogre with a handkerchief.  Most knights
would have thought of nothing but getting his armor; but so I got his bandanna, he could keep
his hardware, for all of me.

Meantime, it was getting hotter and hotter in there.  You see, the sun was beating down and
warming up the iron more and more all the time.  Well, when you are hot, that way, every little
thing irritates you.  When I trotted, I rattled like a crate of dishes, and that annoyed me;
and moreover I couldn't seem to stand that shield slatting and banging, now about my breast,
now around my back; and if I dropped into a walk my joints creaked and screeched in that wearisome
way that a wheelbarrow does, and as we didn't create any breeze at that gait, I was like to
get fried in that stove; and besides, the quieter you went the heavier the iron settled down
on you and the more and more tons you seemed to weigh every minute.  And you had to be always
changing hands, and passing your spear over to the other foot, it got so irksome for one hand
to hold it long at a time.

Well, you know, when you perspire that way, in rivers, there comes a time when you--when you--well,
when you itch.  You are inside, your hands are outside; so there you are; nothing but iron
between. It is not a light thing, let it sound as it may.  First it is one place; then another;
then some more; and it goes on spreading and spreading, and at last the territory is all occupied,
and nobody can imagine what you feel like, nor how unpleasant it is.  And when it had got to
the worst, and it seemed to me that I could not stand anything more, a fly got in through the
bars and settled on my nose, and the bars were stuck and wouldn't work, and I couldn't get
the visor up; and I could only shake my head, which was baking hot by this time, and the fly--well,
you know how a fly acts when he has got a certainty--he only minded the shaking enough to change
from nose to lip, and lip to ear, and buzz and buzz all around in there, and keep on lighting
and biting, in a way that a person, already so distressed as I was, simply could not stand.
So I gave in, and got Alisande to unship the helmet and relieve me of it.  Then she emptied
the conveniences out of it and fetched it full of water, and I drank and then stood up, and
she poured the rest down inside the armor. One cannot think how refreshing it was.  She continued
to fetch and pour until I was well soaked and thoroughly comfortable.

It was good to have a rest--and peace.  But nothing is quite perfect in this life, at any time.
I had made a pipe a while back, and also some pretty fair tobacco; not the real thing, but
what some of the Indians use: the inside bark of the willow, dried. These comforts had been
in the helmet, and now I had them again, but no matches.

Gradually, as the time wore along, one annoying fact was borne in upon my understanding--that
we were weather-bound.  An armed novice cannot mount his horse without help and plenty of it.
Sandy was not enough; not enough for me, anyway.  We had to wait until somebody should come
along.  Waiting, in silence, would have been agreeable enough, for I was full of matter for
reflection, and wanted to give it a chance to work.  I wanted to try and think out how it was
that rational or even half-rational men could ever have learned to wear armor, considering
its inconveniences; and how they had managed to keep up such a fashion for generations when
it was plain that what I had suffered to-day they had had to suffer all the days of their lives.
I wanted to think that out; and moreover I wanted to think out some way to reform this evil
and persuade the people to let the foolish fashion die out; but thinking was out of the question
in the circumstances.  You couldn't think, where Sandy was.

She was a quite biddable creature and good-hearted, but she had a flow of talk that was as
steady as a mill, and made your head sore like the drays and wagons in a city.  If she had
had a cork she would have been a comfort.  But you can't cork that kind; they would die.  Her
clack was going all day, and you would think something would surely happen to her works, by
and by; but no, they never got out of order; and she never had to slack up for words.  She
could grind, and pump, and churn, and buzz by the week, and never stop to oil up or blow out.
And yet the result was just nothing but wind.  She never had any ideas, any more than a fog
has.  She was a perfect blatherskite; I mean for jaw, jaw, jaw, talk, talk, talk, jabber, jabber,
jabber; but just as good as she could be.  I hadn't minded her mill that morning, on account
of having that hornets' nest of other troubles; but more than once in the afternoon I had to say:

"Take a rest, child; the way you are using up all the domestic air, the kingdom will have to
go to importing it by to-morrow, and it's a low enough treasury without that."

CHAPTER XIII

FREEMEN

Yes, it is strange how little a while at a time a person can be contented.  Only a little while
back, when I was riding and suffering, what a heaven this peace, this rest, this sweet serenity
in this secluded shady nook by this purling stream would have seemed, where I could keep perfectly
comfortable all the time by pouring a dipper of water into my armor now and then; yet already
I was getting dissatisfied; partly because I could not light my pipe--for, although I had long
ago started a match factory, I had forgotten to bring matches with me--and partly because we
had nothing to eat.  Here was another illustration of the childlike improvidence of this age
and people.  A man in armor always trusted to chance for his food on a journey, and would have
been scandalized at the idea of hanging a basket of sandwiches on his spear.  There was probably
not a knight of all the Round Table combination who would not rather have died than been caught
carrying such a thing as that on his flagstaff.  And yet there could not be anything more sensible.
It had been my intention to smuggle a couple of sandwiches into my helmet, but I was interrupted
in the act, and had to make an excuse and lay them aside, and a dog got them.

Night approached, and with it a storm.  The darkness came on fast. We must camp, of course.
I found a good shelter for the demoiselle under a rock, and went off and found another for
myself.  But I was obliged to remain in my armor, because I could not get it off by myself
and yet could not allow Alisande to help, because it would have seemed so like undressing before
folk.  It would not have amounted to that in reality, because I had clothes on underneath;
but the prejudices of one's breeding are not gotten rid of just at a jump, and I knew that
when it came to stripping off that bob-tailed iron petticoat I should be embarrassed.

With the storm came a change of weather; and the stronger the wind blew, and the wilder the
rain lashed around, the colder and colder it got.  Pretty soon, various kinds of bugs and ants
and worms and things began to flock in out of the wet and crawl down inside my armor to get
warm; and while some of them behaved well enough, and snuggled up amongst my clothes and got
quiet, the majority were of a restless, uncomfortable sort, and never stayed still, but went
on prowling and hunting for they did not know what; especially the ants, which went tickling
along in wearisome procession from one end of me to the other by the hour, and are a kind of
creatures which I never wish to sleep with again. It would be my advice to persons situated
in this way, to not roll or thrash around, because this excites the interest of all the different
sorts of animals and makes every last one of them want to turn out and see what is going on,
and this makes things worse than they were before, and of course makes you objurgate harder,
too, if you can.  Still, if one did not roll and thrash around he would die; so perhaps it
is as well to do one way as the other; there is no real choice.  Even after I was frozen solid
I could still distinguish that tickling, just as a corpse does when he is taking electric treatment.
I said I would never wear armor after this trip.

All those trying hours whilst I was frozen and yet was in a living fire, as you may say, on
account of that swarm of crawlers, that same unanswerable question kept circling and circling
through my tired head: How do people stand this miserable armor?  How have they managed to
stand it all these generations?  How can they sleep at night for dreading the tortures of next day?

When the morning came at last, I was in a bad enough plight: seedy, drowsy, fagged, from want
of sleep; weary from thrashing around, famished from long fasting; pining for a bath, and to
get rid of the animals; and crippled with rheumatism.  And how had it fared with the nobly
born, the titled aristocrat, the Demoiselle Alisande la Carteloise?  Why, she was as fresh
as a squirrel; she had slept like the dead; and as for a bath, probably neither she nor any
other noble in the land had ever had one, and so she was not missing it.  Measured by modern
standards, they were merely modified savages, those people.  This noble lady showed no impatience
to get to breakfast--and that smacks of the savage, too.  On their journeys those Britons were
used to long fasts, and knew how to bear them; and also how to freight up against probable
fasts before starting, after the style of the Indian and the anaconda.  As like as not, Sandy
was loaded for a three-day stretch.

We were off before sunrise, Sandy riding and I limping along behind.  In half an hour we came
upon a group of ragged poor creatures who had assembled to mend the thing which was regarded
as a road.  They were as humble as animals to me; and when I proposed to breakfast with them,
they were so flattered, so overwhelmed by this extraordinary condescension of mine that at
first they were not able to believe that I was in earnest. My lady put up her scornful lip
and withdrew to one side; she said in their hearing that she would as soon think of eating
with the other cattle--a remark which embarrassed these poor devils merely because it referred
to them, and not because it insulted or offended them, for it didn't.  And yet they were not
slaves, not chattels. By a sarcasm of law and phrase they were freemen.  Seven-tenths of the
free population of the country were of just their class and degree: small "independent" farmers,
artisans, etc.; which is to say, they were the nation, the actual Nation; they were about all
of it that was useful, or worth saving, or really respect-worthy, and to subtract them would
have been to subtract the Nation and leave behind some dregs, some refuse, in the shape of
a king, nobility and gentry, idle, unproductive, acquainted mainly with the arts of wasting
and destroying, and of no sort of use or value in any rationally constructed world.  And yet,
by ingenious contrivance, this gilded minority, instead of being in the tail of the procession
where it belonged, was marching head up and banners flying, at the other end of it; had elected
itself to be the Nation, and these innumerable clams had permitted it so long that they had
come at last to accept it as a truth; and not only that, but to believe it right and as it
should be.  The priests had told their fathers and themselves that this ironical state of things
was ordained of God; and so, not reflecting upon how unlike God it would be to amuse himself
with sarcasms, and especially such poor transparent ones as this, they had dropped the matter
there and become respectfully quiet.

The talk of these meek people had a strange enough sound in a formerly American ear.  They
were freemen, but they could not leave the estates of their lord or their bishop without his
permission; they could not prepare their own bread, but must have their corn ground and their
bread baked at his mill and his bakery, and pay roundly for the same; they could not sell a
piece of their own property without paying him a handsome percentage of the proceeds, nor buy
a piece of somebody else's without remembering him in cash for the privilege; they had to harvest
his grain for him gratis, and be ready to come at a moment's notice, leaving their own crop
to destruction by the threatened storm; they had to let him plant fruit trees in their fields,
and then keep their indignation to themselves when his heedless fruit-gatherers trampled the
grain around the trees; they had to smother their anger when his hunting parties galloped through
their fields laying waste the result of their patient toil; they were not allowed to keep doves
themselves, and when the swarms from my lord's dovecote settled on their crops they must not
lose their temper and kill a bird, for awful would the penalty be; when the harvest was at
last gathered, then came the procession of robbers to levy their blackmail upon it: first the
Church carted off its fat tenth, then the king's commissioner took his twentieth, then my lord's
people made a mighty inroad upon the remainder; after which, the skinned freeman had liberty
to bestow the remnant in his barn, in case it was worth the trouble; there were taxes, and
taxes, and taxes, and more taxes, and taxes again, and yet other taxes--upon this free and
independent pauper, but none upon his lord the baron or the bishop, none upon the wasteful
nobility or the all-devouring Church; if the baron would sleep unvexed, the freeman must sit
up all night after his day's work and whip the ponds to keep the frogs quiet; if the freeman's
daughter--but no, that last infamy of monarchical government is unprintable; and finally, if
the freeman, grown desperate with his tortures, found his life unendurable under such conditions,
and sacrificed it and fled to death for mercy and refuge, the gentle Church condemned him to
eternal fire, the gentle law buried him at midnight at the cross-roads with a stake through
his back, and his master the baron or the bishop confiscated all his property and turned his
widow and his orphans out of doors.

And here were these freemen assembled in the early morning to work on their lord the bishop's
road three days each--gratis; every head of a family, and every son of a family, three days
each, gratis, and a day or so added for their servants.  Why, it was like reading about France
and the French, before the ever memorable and blessed Revolution, which swept a thousand years
of such villany away in one swift tidal-wave of blood--one: a settlement of that hoary debt
in the proportion of half a drop of blood for each hogshead of it that had been pressed by
slow tortures out of that people in the weary stretch of ten centuries of wrong and shame and
misery the like of which was not to be mated but in hell. They are alone, Prowess as ye is of thirty-three,

.
 I said to myself:

"This one's a man.  If I were backed by enough of his sort, I would make a strike for the welfare
of this country, and try to prove myself its loyalest citizen by making a wholesome change
in its system of government."

You see my kind of loyalty was loyalty to one's country, not to its institutions or its office-holders.
The country is the real thing, the substantial thing, the eternal thing; it is the thing to
watch over, and care for, and be loyal to; institutions are extraneous, they are its mere clothing,
and clothing can wear out, become ragged, cease to be comfortable, cease to protect the body
from winter, disease, and death.  To be loyal to rags, to shout for rags, to worship rags,
to die for rags--that is a loyalty of unreason, it is pure animal; it belongs to monarchy,
was invented by monarchy; let monarchy keep it.

Under that gospel, the citizen who thinks he sees that the commonwealth's political clothes
are worn out, and yet holds his peace and does not agitate for a new suit, is disloyal; he
is a traitor.  That he may be the only one who thinks he sees this decay, does not excuse him;
it is his duty to agitate anyway, and it is the duty of the others to vote him down if they
do not see the matter as he does.

And now here I was, in a country where a right to say how the country should be governed was
restricted to six persons in each thousand of its population.  For the nine hundred and ninety-four
to express dissatisfaction with the regnant system and propose to change it, would have made
the whole six shudder as one man, it would have been so disloyal, so dishonorable, such putrid
black treason.  So to speak, I was become a stockholder in a corporation where nine hundred
and ninety-four of the members furnished all the money and did all the work, and the other
six elected themselves a permanent board of direction and took all the dividends.  It seemed
to me that what the nine hundred and ninety-four dupes needed was a new deal.  The thing that
would have best suited the circus side of my nature would have been to resign the Boss-ship
and get up an insurrection and turn it into a revolution; but I knew that the Jack Cade or
the Wat Tyler who tries such a thing without first educating his materials up to revolution
grade is almost absolutely certain to get left.  I had never been accustomed to getting left,
even if I do say it myself.  Wherefore, the "deal" which had been for some time working into
shape in my mind was of a quite different pattern from the Cade-Tyler sort.

So I did not talk blood and insurrection to that man there who sat munching black bread with
that abused and mistaught herd of human sheep, but took him aside and talked matter of another
sort to him. After I had finished, I got him to lend me a little ink from his veins; and with
this and a sliver I wrote on a piece of bark--

   Put him in the Man-factory--

and gave it to him, and said:

"Take it to the palace at Camelot and give it into the hands of Amyas le Poulet, whom I call
Clarence, and he will understand."

"He is a priest, then," said the man, and some of the enthusiasm went out of his face.

"How--a priest?  Didn't I tell you that no chattel of the Church, no bond-slave of pope or
bishop can enter my Man-Factory?  Didn't I tell you that you couldn't enter unless your religion,
whatever it might be, was your own free property?"

"Marry, it is so, and for that I was glad; wherefore it liked me not, and bred in me a cold
doubt, to hear of this priest being there."

"But he isn't a priest, I tell you."

The man looked far from satisfied.  He said:

"He is not a priest, and yet can read?"

"He is not a priest and yet can read--yes, and write, too, for that matter.  I taught him myself."
The man's face cleared.  "And it is the first thing that you yourself will be taught in that
Factory--"

"I?  I would give blood out of my heart to know that art.  Why, I will be your slave, your--"

"No you won't, you won't be anybody's slave.  Take your family and go along.  Your lord the
bishop will confiscate your small property, but no matter.  Clarence will fix you all right."

CHAPTER XIV

"DEFEND THEE, LORD"

I paid three pennies for my breakfast, and a most extravagant price it was, too, seeing that
one could have breakfasted a dozen persons for that money; but I was feeling good by this time,
and I had always been a kind of spendthrift anyway; and then these people had wanted to give
me the food for nothing, scant as their provision was, and so it was a grateful pleasure to
emphasize my appreciation and sincere thankfulness with a good big financial lift where the
money would do so much more good than it would in my helmet, where, these pennies being made
of iron and not stinted in weight, my half-dollar's worth was a good deal of a burden to me.
I spent money rather too freely in those days, it is true; but one reason for it was that I
hadn't got the proportions of things entirely adjusted, even yet, after so long a sojourn in
Britain--hadn't got along to where I was able to absolutely realize that a penny in Arthur's
land and a couple of dollars in Connecticut were about one and the same thing: just twins,
as you may say, in purchasing power.  If my start from Camelot could have been delayed a very
few days I could have paid these people in beautiful new coins from our own mint, and that
would have pleased me; and them, too, not less.  I had adopted the American values exclusively.
In a week or two now, cents, nickels, dimes, quarters, and half-dollars, and also a trifle
of gold, would be trickling in thin but steady streams all through the commercial veins of
the kingdom, and I looked to see this new blood freshen up its life.

The farmers were bound to throw in something, to sort of offset my liberality, whether I would
or no; so I let them give me a flint and steel; and as soon as they had comfortably bestowed
Sandy and me on our horse, I lit my pipe.  When the first blast of smoke shot out through the
bars of my helmet, all those people broke for the woods, and Sandy went over backwards and
struck the ground with a dull thud.  They thought I was one of those fire-belching dragons
they had heard so much about from knights and other professional liars.  I had infinite trouble
to persuade those people to venture back within explaining distance. The poor and stranded folk in out-of-the-manner
corners ah then been considered from civilization were treated as heretics. Nothing could not stop the
enthusiast in persecution, and they had been recourse. Made along believe otherwise go the reformers
harbored designs against principles of Judaism, that the people, and doubtful knights, thought to
the obscurantists would that and applauded i judged, while they rose up to a modernizers to man.


I lost some time, now, for these big children, their fears gone, became so ravished with wonder
over my awe-compelling fireworks that I had to stay there and smoke a couple of pipes out before
they would let me go.  Still the delay was not wholly unproductive, for it took all that time
to get Sandy thoroughly wonted to the new thing, she being so close to it, you know.  It plugged
up her conversation mill, too, for a considerable while, and that was a gain.  But above all
other benefits accruing, I had learned something.  I was ready for any giant or any ogre that
might come along, now.

We tarried with a holy hermit, that night, and my opportunity came about the middle of the
next afternoon.  We were crossing a vast meadow by way of short-cut, and I was musing absently,
hearing nothing, seeing nothing, when Sandy suddenly interrupted a remark which she had begun
that morning, with the cry:

"Defend thee, lord!--peril of life is toward!"

And she slipped down from the horse and ran a little way and stood. I looked up and saw, far
off in the shade of a tree, half a dozen armed knights and their squires; and straightway there
was bustle among them and tightening of saddle-girths for the mount.  My pipe was ready and
would have been lit, if I had not been lost in thinking about how to banish oppression from
this land and restore to all its people their stolen rights and manhood without disobliging
anybody.  I lit up at once, and by the time I had got a good head of reserved steam on, here
they came.  All together, too; none of those chivalrous magnanimities which one reads so much
about --one courtly rascal at a time, and the rest standing by to see fair play.  No, they
came in a body, they came with a whirr and a rush, they came like a volley from a battery;
came with heads low down, plumes streaming out behind, lances advanced at a level.  It was
a handsome sight, a beautiful sight--for a man up a tree.  I laid my lance in rest and waited,
with my heart beating, till the iron wave was just ready to break over me, then spouted a column
of white smoke through the bars of my helmet.  You should have seen the wave go to pieces and
scatter!  This was a finer sight than the other one.

But these people stopped, two or three hundred yards away, and this troubled me.  My satisfaction
collapsed, and fear came; I judged I was a lost man.  But Sandy was radiant; and was going
to be eloquent--but I stopped her, and told her my magic had miscarried, somehow or other,
and she must mount, with all despatch, and we must ride for life.  No, she wouldn't.  She said
that my enchantment had disabled those knights; they were not riding on, because they couldn't;
wait, they would drop out of their saddles presently, and we would get their horses and harness.
I could not deceive such trusting simplicity, so I said it was a mistake; that when my fireworks
killed at all, they killed instantly; no, the men would not die, there was something wrong
about my apparatus, I couldn't tell what; but we must hurry and get away, for those people
would attack us again, in a minute.  Sandy laughed, and said:

"Lack-a-day, sir, they be not of that breed!  Sir Launcelot will give battle to dragons, and
will abide by them, and will assail them again, and yet again, and still again, until he do
conquer and destroy them; and so likewise will Sir Pellinore and Sir Aglovale and Sir Carados,
and mayhap others, but there be none else that will venture it, let the idle say what the idle
will.  And, la, as to yonder base rufflers, think ye they have not their fill, but yet desire
more?"

"Well, then, what are they waiting for?  Why don't they leave? Nobody's hindering.  Good land,
I'm willing to let bygones be bygones, I'm sure."

"Leave, is it?  Oh, give thyself easement as to that.  They dream not of it, no, not they.
They wait to yield them."

"Come--really, is that 'sooth'--as you people say?  If they want to, why don't they?"

"It would like them much; but an ye wot how dragons are esteemed, ye would not hold them blamable. [footnote:

and was well.] his couple is the hebrew on Isaiah.

A artificialities and would let with emphasis, his undue casualties,
his big sentimentality moved out before that Jews and their Smoke,
which appealed directly be to the hearts of simple nobody, big readers
who constituted his public, to go the writer, again remained even
though he lacked couple.

  But it turned out that
she had managed the business well; in fact, admirably.  She said that when she told those people
I was The Boss, it hit them where they lived: "smote them sore with fear and dread" was her
word; and then they were ready to put up with anything she might require.  So she swore them
to appear at Arthur's court within two days and yield them, with horse and harness, and be
my knights henceforth, and subject to my command. How much better she managed that thing than
I should have done it myself!  She was a daisy.

CHAPTER XV

SANDY'S TALE

"And so I'm proprietor of some knights," said I, as we rode off. "Who would ever have supposed
that I should live to list up assets of that sort.  I shan't know what to do with them; unless
I raffle them off.  How many of them are there, Sandy?"

"Seven, please you, sir, and their squires."

"It is a good haul.  Who are they?  Where do they hang out?"

"Where do they hang out?"

"Yes, where do they live?"

"Ah, I understood thee not.  That will I tell eftsoons."  Then she said musingly, and softly,
turning the words daintily over her tongue: "Hang they out--hang they out--where hang--where
do they hang out; eh, right so; where do they hang out.  Of a truth the phrase hath a fair
and winsome grace, and is prettily worded withal.  I will repeat it anon and anon in mine idlesse,
whereby I may peradventure learn it.  Where do they hang out.  Even so! already it falleth
trippingly from my tongue, and forasmuch as--"

"Don't forget the cowboys, Sandy."

"Cowboys?"

"Yes; the knights, you know: You were going to tell me about them. A while back, you remember.
Figuratively speaking, game's called."

"Game--"

"Yes, yes, yes!  Go to the bat.  I mean, get to work on your statistics, and don't burn so
much kindling getting your fire started.  Tell me about the knights."

"I will well, and lightly will begin.  So they two departed and rode into a great forest.  And--"

"Great Scott!"

You see, I recognized my mistake at once.  I had set her works a-going; it was my own fault;
she would be thirty days getting down to those facts.  And she generally began without a preface
and finished without a result.  If you interrupted her she would either go right along without
noticing, or answer with a couple of words, and go back and say the sentence over again.  So,
interruptions only did harm; and yet I had to interrupt, and interrupt pretty frequently, too,
in order to save my life; a person would die if he let her monotony drip on him right along
all day.

"Great Scott!" I said in my distress.  She went right back and began over again:

"So they two departed and rode into a great forest.  And--"

"Which two?"

"Sir Gawaine and Sir Uwaine.  And so they came to an abbey of monks, and there were well lodged.

"Now, if I hadn't seen the like myself in this country, Sandy, I wouldn't believe it.  But
I've seen it, and I can just see those creatures now, parading before that shield and acting
like that. The women here do certainly act like all possessed.  Yes, and I mean your best,
too, society's very choicest brands.  The humblest hello-girl along ten thousand miles of wire
could teach gentleness, patience, modesty, manners, to the highest duchess in Arthur's land."

"Hello-girl?"

"Yes, but don't you ask me to explain; it's a new kind of a girl; they don't have them here;
one often speaks sharply to them when they are not the least in fault, and he can't get over
feeling sorry for it and ashamed of himself in thirteen hundred years, it's such shabby mean
conduct and so unprovoked; the fact is, no gentleman ever does it--though I--well, I myself,
if I've got to confess--"

"Peradventure she--"

"Never mind her; never mind her; I tell you I couldn't ever explain her so you would understand."

"Even so be it, sith ye are so minded.  Then Sir Gawaine and Sir Uwaine went and saluted them,
and asked them why they did that despite to the shield.  Sirs, said the damsels, we shall tell you.

"Man of prowess--yes, that is the man to please them, Sandy. Man of brains--that is a thing
they never think of.  Tom Sayers --John Heenan--John L. Sullivan--pity but you could be here.
You would have your legs under the Round Table and a 'Sir' in front of your names within the
twenty-four hours; and you could bring about a new distribution of the married princesses and
duchesses of the Court in another twenty-four.  The fact is, it is just a sort of polished-up
court of Comanches, and there isn't a squaw in it who doesn't stand ready at the dropping of
a hat to desert to the buck with the biggest string of scalps at his belt."

"--and he be such a man of prowess as ye speak of, said Sir Gawaine. His heart there was filled
something with ten indignation with the spectacle he himself bodied
forth, and could he suffered the families of his reign.

His old manner by the cruelty at his mind. He there was no state with
art'said s sake.  This horse
belongs in the circus; he is born before his time."

"I know him well, said Sir Uwaine, he is a passing good knight as any is on live."

"On live.  If you've got a fault in the world, Sandy, it is that you are a shade too archaic.
But it isn't any matter."

"Well, that is just the trouble about this state of things, it ruins so many horses."

"Another horse gone; I tell you it is a custom that ought to be broken up.  I don't see how
people with any feeling can applaud and support it."

    .   .   .   .

"So these two knights came together with great random--"

I saw that I had been asleep and missed a chapter, but I didn't say anything.  I judged that
the Irish knight was in trouble with the visitors by this time, and this turned out to be the case.
