CHAPTER XXI.

AT THE UNIVERSITY.

The weeks following my graduation were as ill suited as possible to the decision of any serious
question.

After a gay journey through Bohemia which ended in venerable Prague, I divided my time between
Hosterwitz, Blasewitz, and Dresden.  In the latter city I met among other persons, principally
old friends, the son of my uncle Brandenstein, an Austrian lieutenant on leave of absence.
I spent many a pleasant evening with him and his comrades, who were also on leave.  These young
gentlemen considered the Italians, against whom they fought, as rebels, while a cousin of my
uncle, then Colonel von Brandenstein, but afterwards promoted in the Franco-Austrian war in
1859 and 1866 to the rank of master of ordnance, held a totally different opinion.  This clever,
warmhearted soldier understood the Italians and their struggle for unity and freedom, and judged
them so justly and therefore favorably, that he often aroused the courteous opposition of his
younger comrades.  I did not neglect old friends, however, and when I did not go to the theatre
in the evening I ended the day with my aunt at Blasewitz.  But, on my mother's account, I was
never long absent from Hosterwitz.  I enjoyed being with her so much.  We drove and walked
together, and discussed everything the past had brought and the future promised.

Yet I longed for academic freedom, and especially to sit at the feet of an Ernst Curtius, and
be initiated by Waitz into the methodical study of history.

The evening before my departure my mother drove with me to Blasewitz, where there was an elegant
entertainment at which the lyric poet Julius Hammer, the author of "Look Around You and Look
Within You," who was to become a dear friend of mine, extolled in enthusiastic verse the delights
of student liberty and the noble sisters Learning and Poesy.

The glowing words echoed in my heart and mind after I had torn myself from the arms of my mother
and of the woman who, next to her, was dearest to me on earth, my aunt, and was travelling
toward my goal.  If ever the feeling that I was born to good fortune took possession of me,
it was during that journey.

I did not know what weariness meant, and when, on reaching Gottingen, I learned that the students'
coffee-house was still closed and that no one would arrive for three or four days, I went to
Cassel to visit the royal garden in Wilhelmshohe.

At the station I saw a gentleman who looked intently at me.  His face, too, seemed familiar.
I mentioned my name, and the next instant he had embraced and kissed me.  Two Keilhau friends
had met, and, with sunshine alike in our hearts and in the blue sky, we set off together to
see everything of note in beautiful Cassel.

When it was time to part, Von Born told me so eagerly how many of our old school-mates were
now living in Westphalia, and how delightful it would be to see them, that I yielded and went
with him to the birthplace of Barop and Middendorf.  The hours flew like one long revel, and
my exuberant spirits made my old school-mates, who, engaged in business enterprises, were beginning
to look life solemnly in the face, feel as if the carefree Keilhau days had returned.  On going
back to Gottingen, I still had to wait a few days for the real commencement of the term, but
I was received at the station by the "Saxons," donned the blue cap, and engaged pleasant lodgings--though
the least adapted to serious study in the "Schonhutte," a house in Weenderstrasse whose second
story was occupied by our corps room.

My expectations of the life with young men of congenial tastes were completely fulfilled. 
Most of them belonged to the nobility, but the beloved "blue, white, and blue" removed all
distinctions of birth.

By far the most talented of its members was Count (now Prince) Otto von Stolberg-Wernegerode,
who was afterwards to hold so high a position in the service of the Prussian Government.

Among the other scions of royal families were the hereditary Prince Louis of Hesse-Darmstadt
and his brother Henry.  Both were vivacious, agreeable young men, who entered eagerly into
all the enjoyments of student and corps life.  The older brother, who died as Grand Duke, continued
his friendship for me while sovereign of his country. Her convince a sword was not then natural

  A sharp division
had taken place in my nature.  By night, in arduous conflict, I led a strange mental life,
known to myself alone; by day all this was forgotten, unless--and how rarely this happened--some
conversation recalled it.

From my first step out of doors I belonged to life, to the corps, to pleasure.  What was individual
existence, mortality, or the eternal life of the soul!  Minerva's bird is an owl.  Like it,
these learned questions belonged to the night.  They should cast no shadow on the brightness
of my day.  When I met the first friend in the blue cap no one need have sung our corps song,
"Away with cares and crotchets!"

At no time had the exuberant joy in mere existence stirred more strongly within me.  My whole
nature was filled with the longing to utilize and enjoy this brief earthly life which Feuerbach
had proved was to end with death.

                    Better an hour's mad revel,
                    E'en a kiss from a Moenad's lip,
                    Than a year of timid doubting,
                    Daring only to taste and sip,

were the closing lines of a song which I composed at this time.

So my old wantonness unfolded its wings, but it was not to remain always unpunished.

My mother had gone to Holland with Paula just before Advent, and as I could not spend my next
vacation at home, she promised to furnish me with means to take a trip through the great German
Hanse cities.

In Bremen I was most cordially received in the family of Mohr, a member of my corps, in whose
circle I spent some delightful hours, and also an evening never to be forgotten in the famous
old Rathskeller.

But I wished to see the harbour of the great commercial city, and the ships which ploughed
the ocean to those distant lands for which I had often longed.

Since I had shot my first hare in Komptendorf and brought down my first partridge from the
air, the love of sport had never slumbered; I gratified it whenever I could, and intended to
take a boat from Bremerhaven and go as near as possible to the sea, where I could shoot the
cormorants and the bald-headed eagles which hunters on the seashore class among the most precious
booty.

In Bremerhaven an architect whose acquaintance I had made on the way became my cicerone, and
showed me all the sights of the small but very quaint port.  I had expected to find the bustle
on shore greater, but what a throng of ships and boats, masts and smoke-stacks I saw!

My guide showed me the last lighthouse which had been built, and took me on board of a mail
steamer which was about to sail to America.

I was deeply interested in all this, but my companion promised to show me things still more
remarkable if I would give up my shooting excursion.

Unfortunately, I insisted upon my plan, and the next morning sailed in a pouring rain through
a dense mist to the mouth of the Weser and out to sea.  But, instead of pleasure and booty,
I gained on this expedition nothing but discomfort and drenching, which resulted in a violent cold.

What I witnessed and experienced in my journey back to Cuttingen is scarcely worth mentioning.
The only enjoyable hours were spent at the theatre in Hanover, where I saw Niemann in Templar
and Jewess, and for the first time witnessed the thoroughly studied yet perfectly natural impersonations
of Marie Seebach.  I also remember with much pleasure the royal riding-school in charge of
General Meyer.  Never have I seen the strength of noble chargers controlled and guided with
so much firmness, ease, and grace as by the hand of this officer, the best horseman in Germany.

CHAPTER XXII.

THE SHIPWRECK

The state of health in which, still with a slight fever recurring every afternoon, I returned
to Gottingen was by no means cheering.

Besides, I was obliged at once to undergo the five days' imprisonment to which I had been justly
sentenced for reckless shooting across the street.

During the day I read, besides some very trashy novels, several by Jean Paul, with most of
which I had become familiar while a school-boy in the first class.

They had given me so much pleasure that I was vexed with the indifference with which some of
my friends laid the works of the great humorist aside.

There were rarely any conversations on the more serious scientific subjects among the members
of the corps, though it did not lack talented young men, and some of the older ones were industrious.

Nothing, perhaps, lends the life of the corps a greater charm than the affectionate intercourse
which unites individuals.

I was always sure of finding sympathizers for everything that touched my feelings.

With regard to the results of my nocturnal labour the case was very different.  If any one
else had "bored" me at the tavern about his views of Feuerbach and Lotze, I should undoubtedly
have stopped him with Goethe's "Ergo bibamus."

  Then he advised me to read Bacon, study Kant,
Plato, and the other ancient philosophers--Lotze, too, if I desired--and when I had them all
by heart, take up the lesser lights, and even then be in no hurry to read Feuerbach and his
wild theology.

I met and conversed with him again whenever I could, and he availed himself of the confidence
he inspired to arouse my enthusiasm for the study of jurisprudence.  So I am indebted to Pernice
for many benefits. In one respect only my reverence for him entailed a certain peril.

He knew what I was doing, but instead of warning me of the danger which threatened me from
toiling at night after such exciting days, he approved my course and described episodes of
his own periods of study.

One of the three essays for which he received prizes had been written to compel his father
to retract the "stupid fellow" with which he had insulted him.  At that time he had sat over
his books day and night for weeks, and, thank Heaven, did not suffer from it.

His colossal frame really did seem immovable, and I deemed mine, though much slighter, capable
of nearly equal endurance.  It required severe exertions to weary me, and my mind possessed
the capacity to devote itself to strenuous labour directly after the gayest amusements, and
there was no lack of such "pastimes" either in Gottingen or just beyond its limits.

Among the latter was an excursion to Cassel which was associated with an adventure whose singular
course impressed it firmly on my memory.

When we arrived, chilled by the railway journey, an acquaintance of the friend who accompanied
me ordered rum and water for us, and we laughed and jested with the landlord's pretty daughters,
who brought it to us.

As it had been snowing heavily and the sleighing was excellent, we determined to return directly
after dinner, and drive as far as Munden. Of course the merry girls would be welcome companions,
and we did not find it very difficult to persuade them to go part of the way with us.

So we hired two sleighs to convey us to a village distant about an hour's ride, from which
we were to send them back in one, while my friend and I pursued our journey in the other.

After a lively dinner with our friends they joined us.

The snow-storm, which had ceased for several hours, began again, growing more and more violent
as we drove on.  I never saw such masses of the largest flakes, and just outside the village
where the girls were to turn back the horses could barely force their way through the white
mass which transformed the whole landscape into a single snowy coverlet.

The clouds seemed inexhaustible, and when the time for departure came the driver declared that
it would be impossible to go back to Cassel.

The girls, who, exhilarated by the swift movement through the cold, bracing air, had entered
into our merriment, grew more and more anxious. Our well-meant efforts to comfort them were
rejected; they were angry with us for placing them in such an unpleasant position.

The lamps were lighted when I thought of taking the landlady into our confidence and asking
her to care for the poor frightened children.  She was a kind, sensible woman, and though she
at first exclaimed over their heedlessness, she addressed them with maternal tenderness and
showed them to the room they were to occupy.

They came down again at supper reassured, and we ate the rustic meal together very merrily.
One of them wrote a letter to her father, saying that they had been detained by the snow at
the house of an acquaintance, and a messenger set off with it at sunrise, but we were told
that the road would not be passable before noon.

Yet, gay as our companions were at breakfast, the thought of entertaining them longer seemed
irksome, and as the church bells were ringing some one proposed that we should go.

A path had been shovelled, and we were soon seated in the country church. The pastor, a fine-looking
man of middle age, entered, and though I no longer remember his text, I recollect perfectly
that he spoke of the temptations which threaten to lure us from the right paths and the means
of resisting them.

One of the most effectual, he said, was the remembrance of those to whom we owe love and respect.
I thought of my mother and blind old Langethal, of Tzschirner, and of Herbert Pernice, and,
dissatisfied with myself, resolved to do in the future not only what was seemly, but what the
duty of entering more deeply into the science which I had chosen required.

The childish faith which Feuerbach's teachings had threatened to destroy seemed to gaze loyally
at me with my mother's eyes.  I felt that Pernice was right--it was the warm heart, not the
cool head, which should deal with these matters, and I left the church, which I had entered
merely to shorten an hour, feeling as if released from a burden.

Our return home was pleasant, and I began to attend the law lectures at Gottingen with tolerable
regularity.

I was as full of life, and, when occasion offered, as reckless, as ever, though a strange symptom
began to make itself unpleasantly felt.  It appeared only after severe exertion in walking,
fencing, or dancing, and consisted of a peculiar, tender feeling in the soles of my feet, which
I attributed to some fault of the shoemaker, and troubled myself the less about it because
it vanished soon after I came in.

But the family of Professor Baum, the famous surgeon, where I was very intimate, had thought
ever since my return from the Christmas vacation that I did not look well.

We now discussed in what sequence and manner I should go to work, and to this day I admire
the composure, penetration, and lucidity with which he sketched a plan of study that covered years.

I have reason to be grateful to this great scholar for the introduction to my special science,
but still more for the wisdom with which he pointed out the direction of my studies.  Like
Jacob Grimm, he compelled me, as an Egyptologist, to remain in connection with the kindred
departments.

Later my own experience was to teach me the correctness of his assertion that it would be a
mistake to commence by studying so restricted a science as Egyptology.

My pupils can bear witness that during my long period of teaching I always strove to urge students
who intended to devote themselves to Egyptology first to strengthen the foundations, without
which the special structure lacks support.

Lepsius's plan of instruction provided that I should follow these principles from the beginning.
The task I had to perform was a great and difficult one.  How infinitely easier it was for
those whom I had the privilege of introducing to this science!  The lecture-rooms of famous
teachers stood open to them, while my physical condition kept me for weeks from the university;
and how scanty were the aids to which the student could turn!  Yet the zeal--nay, the enthusiasm--with
which I devoted myself to the study was so great that it conquered every difficulty.

     [I had no dictionary and no grammar for the hieroglyphic language
     save Champollion's.  No Stern had treated Coptic in a really
     scientific manner.  I was obliged to learn it according to Tuki,
     Peyron, Tattam, and Steinthal-Schwarze.  For the hieratic there was
     no aid save my own industry and the lists I had myself compiled from
     the scanty texts then at the disposal of the student.  Lepsius had
     never devoted much time to them.  Brugsch's demotic grammar had
     appeared, but its use was rendered very difficult by the lack of
     conformity between the type and the actual signs.]

When I recall the amount of knowledge I mastered in a few terms it seems incredible; yet my
labour was interrupted every summer by a sojourn at the springs--once three months, and never
for a less period than six weeks.  True, I was never wholly idle while using the waters, but,
on the other hand, I was obliged to consider the danger that in winter constantly threatened
my health.  All night-work was strictly forbidden and, if I sat too long over my books by day,
my mother reminded me of my promise to the doctor, and I was obliged to stop.

During the first years I worked almost exclusively at home, for I was permitted to go out only
in very pleasant weather.

Dr. Romberg had wisely considered my reluctance to interrupt my studies by a residence in the
south, because he deemed life in a well-ordered household more beneficial to sufferers from
spinal diseases than a warmer climate, when leaving home, as in my case, threatened to disturb
the patient's peace of mind.

For three winters I had been denied visiting the university, the museum, and the libraries.
On the fourth I was permitted to begin, and now, with mature judgment and thorough previous
preparation, I attended the academic lectures, and profited by the treasures of knowledge and
rich collections of the capital.

After my return from Wildbad Lepsius continued his Thursday visits, and during the succeeding
winters still remained my guide, even when I had also placed myself, in the department of the
ancient Egyptian languages, under the instruction of Heinrich Brugsch.

At school, of course, I had not thought of studying Hebrew.  Now I took private lessons in
that language, to which I devoted several hours daily. I had learned to read Sanscrit and to
translate easy passages in the chrestomathy, and devoted myself with special zeal to the study
of the Latin grammar and prosody.  Professor Julius Geppert, the brother of our most intimate
family friend, was my teacher for four terms.

The syntax of the classic languages, which had been my weak point as a school-boy, now aroused
the deepest interest, and I was grateful to Lepsius for having so earnestly insisted upon my
pursuing philology.  I soon felt the warmest appreciation of the Roman comedies, which served
as the foundation of these studies.  What sound wit, what keenness of observation, what a happy
gift of invention, the old comic writers had at their disposal!  I took them up again a few
years ago, after reading with genuine pleasure in Otto Ribbeck's masterpiece, The History of
Roman Poetry, the portions devoted to Plautus and Terence.

The types of character found in these comedies strengthened my conviction that the motives
of human actions and the mental and emotional peculiarities of civilized men in every age always
have been and always will be the same.

With what pleasure, when again permitted to go out in the evening, I witnessed the performances
of Plautus's pieces given by Professor Geppert's pupils!

The refreshed and enlarged knowledge of school Latin was of great service in writing, and afterwards
discussing, a Latin dissertation.  I devoted perhaps a still larger share of my time to Greek,
and, as the fruit of these studies, still possess many translations from Anacreon, Sappho,
and numerous fragments from the Bergk collection of Greek lyrics, but, with the exception of
those introduced into my novels, none have been printed.

During my leisure hours translating afforded me special pleasure. Personal drawings, that pull general, followed
during succession. The upshot them was not a request in a experience representing "the Parnell
Commissioners enjoying themselves up the Time" in a pause for the
trial of Parnell 5. the "Times."

  When I had conquered
the first difficulties I took up Tennyson's Idyls of the King, and at last succeeded in translating
two of these beautiful poems in the metre of the original.

My success with Enid I think was very tolerable.  The manuscript still lies in my desk unpublished.

As I was now engaged in studying the languages I easily learned to read Italian, Spanish, and
Dutch books.

In view of this experience, which is not wholly personal, I have wondered whether the instruction
of boys might not be shortened to give them more outdoor exercise.  In how brief a time the
pupils, as men studying for their own benefit, not the teacher's, would acquire many things!
Besides the languages, I studied, at first exclusively under Lepsius's thoroughly admirable
instruction, ancient history and archeology.

Later I owed most to Gerhard, Droysen, Friederichs, and August Bockh.

A kind fate afterwards brought me into personal relations with the latter, whose lectures on
the Athenian financial system were the finest and the most instructive I have ever heard. 
What clearness, what depth of learning, what a subtle sense of humour this splendid old man
possessed!  I attended his lectures in 1863, and how exquisite were the allusions to the by
no means satisfactory political conditions of the times with which he spiced them.  I also
became sincerely attached to Friederichs, and it made me happy to be able to requite him in
some small degree in Egypt for the kindness and unselfishness he had shown me in Berlin.

Bopp's lectures, where I tried to increase my meagre knowledge of Sanscrit, I attended, unfortunately,
only a few hours.

The lectures of the African traveller Heinrich Earth supplied rich sources of material, but
whoever expected to hear bewitching narratives from him would have been disappointed.  Even
in more intimate intercourse he rarely warmed up sufficiently to let others share the rich
treasure of his knowledge and experience.  It seemed as if, during his lonely life in Africa,
he had lost the necessity of exchanging thoughts with his fellow- men.  During this late period
Heinrich Brugsch developed in the linguistic department of Egyptology what I had gained from
Lepsius and by my own industry, and I gladly term myself his pupil.

I have cause to be grateful for the fresh and helpful way in which this great and tireless
investigator gave me a private lecture; but Lepsius had opened the door of our science, and
though he could carry me only to a certain stage in the grammar of the ancient Egyptians, in
other departments I owe him more than any other of my intellectual guides. I am most indebted
to him for the direction to use historical and archaeological authorities critically, and his
correction of the tasks he set me; but our conversations on archaeological subjects have also
been of the greatest interest.

After his death I tried to return in some small degree what his unselfish kindness had bestowed
by accepting the invitation to become his biographer.  In "Richard Lepsius," I describe reverently
but without deviating one step from the truth, this wonderful scholar, who was a faithful and
always affectionate friend.

I can scarcely believe it possible that the dignified man, with the grave, stern, clear-cut,
scholarly face and snow-white hair, was but forty-five years old when he began to direct my
studies; for, spite of his erect bearing and alert, movements, he seemed to me at that time
a venerable old man.  There was something in the aristocratic reserve of his nature and the
cool, penetrating sharpness of his criticism, which is usually found only in men of more mature
years.  I should have supposed him incapable of any heedless word, any warm emotion, until
I afterwards met him under his own roof and enjoyed the warm-hearted cheerfulness of the father
of the family and the graciousness of the host.

It certainly was not the cool, calculating reason, but the heart, which had urged him to devote
so many hours of his precious time to the young follower of his science.

Heinrich Brugsch, my second teacher, was far superior to Lepsius as a decipherer and investigator
of the various stages of the ancient Egyptian languages. (any Feuerbach had not give from space.)

  This was her older sister Fanny,
who had married a few years before a cousin of the same name.

When she at last appeared I was surprised, for I had never met a woman who combined with such
rare beauty and queenly dignity so much winning amiability.  Nothing could be more touching
than the manner in which this admired, brilliant woman of the world devoted herself to the
sick girl.

This lady was present during our conversations, which often turned upon religious questions.

At first I had avoided the subject, but the young girl constantly returned to it, and I soon
perceived that I must summon all my energies to hold my ground against her subtle dialectics.
Once when I expressed my scruples to her sister, she answered, smiling: "Don't be uneasy on
that score; Jenny's armour is strong, but she has sharp arrows in her quiver."

And so indeed it proved.

She felt so sure of her own convictions that she might investigate without peril the views
of those who held a different belief, and beheld in me, as it were, the embodiment of this
opportunity, so she gave me no peace until I had explained the meaning of the words pantheism,
atheism, materialism, etc.

At first I was very cautious, but when I perceived that the opinions of the doubters and deniers
merely inspired her with pity, I spoke more freely.

Her soul was like a polished plate of metal on which a picture is etched. This, her belief,
remained uninjured.  Whatever else might be reflected from the mirror-like surface soon vanished,
leaving no trace.

The young girl died shortly after our separation the following year.  She had grown very dear
to my heart.  Her beloved image appears to me most frequently as she looked in the days when
she was suffering, with thick, fair hair falling in silken masses on her white dress, but amid
keen physical pain the love of pleasure natural to youth still lingered.  She went with me--both
in wheel-chairs--to a ball at the Kursaal, and looked so pretty in an airy, white dress which
her mother and sister had arranged for their darling, that I should have longed to dance with
her had not this pleasure been denied me.

Hirsau had first been suggested as a resting-place, but it was doubtful whether we should find
what we needed there.  If not, the carriage was to convey us to beautiful, quiet Herrenalb,
between Wildbad and Baden-Baden.

But we found what we sought, the most suitable house possible, whose landlady proved to have
been trained as a cook in a Frankfort hotel.

The lodgings we engaged were among the most "romantic" I have ever occupied, for our landlord's
house was built in the ruins of the monastery just beside the old refectory.  The windows of
one room looked out upon the cloisters and the Virgin's chapel, the only part of the once stately
building spared by the French in 1692.

A venerable abode of intellectual life was destroyed with this monastery, founded by a Count
von Calw early in the ninth century.  The tower which has been preserved is one of the oldest
and most interesting works of Romanesque architecture in Germany.

A quieter spot cannot be imagined, for I was the first who sought recreation here.  Surrounded
by memories of olden days, and absolutely undisturbed, I could create admirably.  But one cannot
remain permanently secluded from mankind.

First came the Herr Kameralverwalter, whose stately residence stood near the monastery, and
in his wife's name invited us to use their pretty garden.

This gentleman's title threw his name so far into the shade that I had known the pleasant couple
five weeks before I found it was Belfinger.

We also made the acquaintance of our host, Herr Meyer.  Strange and varied were the paths along
which Fate had led this man.  As a rich bachelor he had welcomed guests to his ever-open house
with salvos of artillery, and hence was still called Cannon Meyer, though, after having squandered
his patrimony, he remained absent from his home for many years.  His career in America was
one of perpetual vicissitudes and full of adventures.  Afore than once he barely escaped death.
At last, conquered by homesickness, he returned to the Black Forest, and with a good, industrious
wife.

His house in the monastery suited his longing for rest; he obtained a position in the morocco
factory in the valley below, which afforded him a support, and his daughters provided for his
physical comfort.

The big, broad-shouldered man with the huge mustache and deep, bass voice looked like some
grey-haired knight whose giant arm could have dealt that Swabian stroke which cleft the foe
from skull to saddle, and yet at that time he was occupied from morning until night in the
delicate work splitting the calf skin from whose thin surfaces, when divided into two portions,
fine morocco is made.

We also met the family of Herr Zahn, in whose factory this leather was manufactured; and when
in the East I saw red, yellow, and green slippers on the feet of so many Moslems, I could not
help thinking of the shady Black Forest.

Sometimes we drove to the little neighbouring town of Calw, where we were most kindly received.
The mornings were uninterrupted, and my work was very successful.  Afternoon sometimes brought
visitors from Wildbad, among whom was the artist Gallait, who with his wife and two young daughters
had come to use the water of the springs.  His paintings, "Egmont in Prison," "The Beheaded
Counts Egmont and Horn," and many others, had aroused the utmost admiration.  Praise and honours
of all kinds had consequently been lavished upon him.  This had brought him to the Spree, and
he had often been a welcome guest in our home.

Like Menzel, Cornelius, Alma Tadema, and Meissonier, he was small in stature, but the features
of his well-formed face were anything but insignificant.  His whole person was distinguished
by something I might term "neatness."  Without any touch of dudishness he gave the impression
of having "just stepped out of a bandbox."  From the white cravat which he always wore, to
the little red ribbon of the order in his buttonhole, everything about him was faultless.

Madame Gallait, a Parisian by birth, was the very embodiment of the French woman in the most
charming sense of the word, and the bond which united her to her husband seemed enduring and
as if woven by the cheeriest gods of love.  Unfortunately, it did not last.

After leaving Hirsau, we again met the Gallaits in Wildbad and spent some delightful days with
them.  The Von Burckhardts, Fran Henrietta Hallberger, the wife of the Stuttgart publisher,
the Puricellis, ourselves, and later the author Moritz Hartmann, were the only persons with
whom they associated.  We always met every afternoon at a certain place in the grounds, where
we talked or some one read aloud.  On these occasions, at Gallait's suggestion, everybody who
was so disposed sketched.  My portrait, which he drew for my mother at that time in black and
red pencils, is now in my wife's possession.  I also took my sketch- book, for he had seen
the school volume I had filled with arabesques just before leaving Keilhau, and I still remember
the 'merveilleux and incroyable, inoui, and insense' which he lavished on the certainly extravagant
creatures of my love-sick imagination.

During these exercises in drawing he related many incidents of his own life, and never was
he more interesting than while describing his first success.

He was the son of a poor widow in the little Belgian town of Tournay. While a school-boy he
greatly enjoyed drawing, and an able teacher perceived his talent.

Once he saw in the newspaper an Antwerp competition for a prize.  A certain subject--if I am
not mistaken, Moses drawing water from the rock in the wilderness--was to be executed with
pencil or charcoal.  He went to work also, though with his defective training he had not the
least hope of success.  When he sent off the finished drawing he avoided taking his mother
into his confidence in order to protect her from disappointment.

On the day the prize was to be awarded the wish to see the work of the successful competitor
drew him to Antwerp, and what was his surprise, on entering the hall, to hear his own name
proclaimed as the victor's!

His mother supported herself and him by a little business in soap.  To increase her delight
he had changed the gold paid to him into shining five franc pieces.  His pockets almost burst
under the weight, but there was no end to the rejoicing when he flung one handful of silver
coins after another on the little counter and told how he had obtained them.

No one who heard him relate this story could help liking him.

Another distinguished visitor at Hirsau was Prince Puckler Muskau.  He had heard that his young
Kottbus acquaintance had begun to devote himself to Egyptology.  This interested the old man,
who, as a special favourite of Mohammed Ali, had spent delightful days on the Nile and made
all sorts of plans for Egypt.  Besides, he was personally acquainted with the great founders
of my science, Thomas Young and Francois Champollion, and had obtained an insight into deciphering
the hieroglyphics.  He knew all the results of the investigations, and expressed an opinion
concerning them. Without having entered deeply into details he often hit the nail on the head.
I doubt whether he had ever held in his hand a book on these subjects, but he had listened
to the answers given by others to his skilful questions with the same keen attention that he
bestowed on mine, and the gift of comprehension peculiar to him enabled him to rapidly shape
what he heard into a distinctly outlined picture.  Therefore he must have seemed to laymen
a very compendium of science, yet he never used this faculty to dazzle others or give himself
the appearance of erudition.

"Man cannot be God," he wrote--I am quoting from a letter received the day after his visit--"yet
'to be like unto God' need not remain a mere theological phrase to the aspirant.  Omniscience
is certainly one of the noblest attributes of the Most High, and the nearer man approaches
it the more surely he gains at least the shadow of a quality to which he cannot aspire."

Finally he discussed his gardening work in the park at Branitz, and I regret having noted only
the main outlines of what he said, for it was as interesting as it was admirable.  I can only
cite the following sentence from a letter addressed to Blasewitz: "What was I to do?  A prince
without a country, like myself, wishes at least to be ruler in one domain, and that I am, as
creator of a park.  The subjects over whom I reign obey me better than the Russians, who still
retain a trace of free will, submit to their Czar.  My trees and bushes obey only me and the
eternal laws implanted in their nature, and which I know.  Should they swerve from them even
a finger's breadth they would no longer be themselves.  It is pleasant to reign over such subjects,
and I would rather be a despot over vegetable organisms than a constitutional king and executor
of the will of the 'images of God,' as men call the sovereign people."

He talked most delightfully of the Viceroy of Egypt, Mohammed Ali, and described the plan which
he had laid before this brilliant ruler of arranging a park around the temple on the island
of Philae, and creating on the eastern bank of the hill beneath shady trees, opposite to the
beautiful island of Isis, a sanitarium especially for consumptives; and whoever has seen this
lovely spot will feel tempted to predict great prosperity for such an enterprise.  My mother
had heard the prince indulge in paradoxical assertions in gay society, and the earnestness
which he now showed led her to remark that she had never seen two natures so radically unlike
united in one individual.  Had she been able to follow his career in life she would have recovered
a third, fourth, and fifth.

These visits brought life and change into our quiet existence, and when four weeks later my
brother Ludo joined us he was delighted with the improvement in my appearance, and I myself
felt the benefit which my paralyzed muscles had received from the baths and the seclusion.

The second season at Wildbad, thanks to the increased intimacy with the friends whose acquaintance
we had made there, was even more enjoyable than the first.

Frau Hallberger was a very beautiful young woman.  Her husband, who was to become my dearest
friend, was detained in Stuttgart by business.  She was unfortunately obliged to use the waters
of the springs medicinally, and many an hour was clouded by mental and physical discomfort.

Yet the vivacity of her intellect, her rare familiarity with all the newest literature, and
her unusually keen appreciation of everything which was beautiful in nature stimulated and
charmed us.  I have never seen any one seek flowers in the field and forest so eagerly, and
she made them into beautiful bouquets, which Louis Gallait called "bewitching flower madrigals."

Moritz Hartmann had not fully recovered from the severe illness which nearly caused his death
while he was a reporter in the Crimean War.  His father-in-law, Herr Rodiger, accompanied him
and watched him with the most touching solicitude.  My mother soon became sincerely attached
to the author, who possessed every quality to win a woman's heart.  He had been considered
the handsomest member of the Frankfort Parliament, and no one could have helped gazing with
pleasure at the faultless symmetry of his features.  He also possessed an unusually musical
voice.  Gallait said that he first thought German a language pleasing to the ear when he heard
it from Hartmann's lips.

These qualities soon won the heart of Frau Puricelli, who had at first been very averse to
making his acquaintance.  The devout, conservative lady had heard enough of his religious and
political views to consider him detestable.  But after Hartmann had talked and read aloud to
her and her daughter in his charming way, she said to me, "What vexes me is that in my old
age I can't help liking such a red Democrat."

During that summer was formed the bond of friendship which, to his life's premature end, united
me to Moritz Hartmann, and led to a correspondence which afforded me the greater pleasure the
more certain I became that he understood me.  We met again in Wildbad the second and third
summers, and with what pleasure I remember our conversations in the stillness of the shady
woods!  But we also shared a noisy amusement, that of pistol practice, to which we daily devoted
an hour.  I was obliged to fire from a wheel-chair, yet, like Hartmann, I could boast of many
a good shot; but the skill of Herr Rodiger, the author's father-in-law, was really wonderful.
Though his hand trembled constantly from an attack of palsy, I don't know now how many times
he pierced the centre of the ace of hearts.

It was Hartmann, too, who constantly urged me to write.  With all due regard for science, he
said he could not admit its right to prison poesy when the latter showed so strong an impulse
towards expression.  I secretly admitted the truth of his remark, but whenever I yielded to
the impulse to write I felt as if I were being disloyal to the mistress to whom I had devoted
all my physical and mental powers.

The conflict which for a long time stirred my whole soul began.  I could say much more of the
first years I spent at Wildbad, but up to the fifth season they bore too much resemblance to
one another to be described in detail.

  The book was a scholarly
work, and also a fascinating romance.

Then he expressed some doubts concerning the space I had devoted to the Egyptians in my first
arrangement.  Their nature was too reserved and typical to hold the interest of the unscientific
reader.  According to his view, I should do well to limit to Egyptian soil what I had gained
by investigation, and to make Grecian life, which was familiar to us moderns as the foundation
of our aesthetic perceptions, more prominent.  The advice was good, and, keeping it in view,
I began to subject the whole romance to a thorough revision.

Before going to Wildbad in the summer of 1863 I had a serious conversation with my teacher
and friend.  Hitherto, he said, he had avoided any discussion of my future; but now that I
was so decidedly convalescing, he must tell me that even the most industrious work as a "private
scholar," as people termed it, would not satisfy me.  I was fitted for an academic career,
and he advised me to keep it in view. As I had already thought of this myself, I eagerly assented,
and my mother was delighted with my resolution.

How we met in Wildbad my never-to-be-forgotten friend the Stuttgart publisher, Eduard von Hallberger;
how he laid hands upon my Egyptian Princess; and how the fate of this book and its author led
through joy and sorrow, pleasure and pain, I hope, ere my last hour strikes, to communicate
to my family and the friends my life and writings have gained.

When I left Berlin, so far recovered that I could again move freely, I was a mature man.  The
period of development lay behind me. To not going these leeks, herb, carrots, turnips, fifty heads
of asparagus, had a truffles, that a cow-money, keeping a French, a peck began of i really
young peas, a teacher, some potatoes, and satisfy a couple of bananas.
  A cruel period of probation, rich in suffering and deprivations,
had made the once careless youth familiar with the serious side of existence, and taught him
to control himself.

After once recognizing that progress in the department of investigation in which I intended
