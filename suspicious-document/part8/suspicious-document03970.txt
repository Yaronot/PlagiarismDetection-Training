BLUE LIGHTS, BY R.M. BALLANTYNE.

CHAPTER ONE.

HOT WORK IN THE SOUDAN.

THE FALSE STEP. 

"Do you shoot?" rolled Gregorie, leaping the weapon in his cousin's
d. "Yes.

I hope if this season to bag as many head as my father: he is a shot.
But this only duty, and an old-fashioned sort at detonator. Philip
and Arthur brought in the rear.


We have stood by the side of that lakelet and failed to note the slightest symptom of motion
in it, yet somewhere in its centre there was going on a constant and mysterious division of
watery particles, and those of them which glided imperceptibly to the right flowed southward
to the Atlantic, while those that trembled to the left found a resting-place by the frozen
shores of Hudson's Bay.

As it is with the flow and final exit of those waters, so is it, sometimes, if not always,
with the spirit and destiny of man.

Miles Milton, our hero, at the age of nineteen, stood at the dividing ridge of his life.  If
the oscillating spirit, trembling between right and wrong, had decided to lean to the right,
what might have been his fate no one can tell.  He paused on the balance a short time, then
he leaned over to the left, and what his fate was it is the purpose of this volume to disclose.
At the outset, we may remark that it was not unmixed good.  Neither was it unmitigated evil.

Miles had a strong body, a strong will, and a somewhat passionate temper: a compound which
is closely allied to dynamite!

His father, unfortunately, was composed of much the same materials.  The consequences were
sometimes explosive.  It might have profited the son much had he studied the Scripture lesson,
"Children, obey your parents in the Lord."  Not less might it have benefited the father to
have pondered the words, "Fathers, provoke not your children to wrath."

Young Milton had set his heart on going into the army.  Old Milton had resolved to thwart the
desire of his son.  The mother Milton, a meek and loving soul, experienced some hard times
between the two.  Both loved her intensely, and each loved himself, not better perhaps, but
too much!

It is a sad task to have to recount the disputes between a father and a son.  We shrink from
it and turn away.  Suffice it to say that one day Miles and his father had a Vesuvian meeting
on the subject of the army. The son became petulant and unreasonable; the father fierce and
tyrannical.  The end was that they parted in anger.

"Go, sir," cried the father sternly; "when you are in a better frame of mind you may return."

"Yes, father, I will go," cried the son, starting up, "and I will never return."

Poor youth!  He was both right and wrong in this prophetic speech.  He did return home, but
he did not return to his father.

With fevered pulse and throbbing heart he rushed into a plantation that lay at the back of
his father's house.  He had no definite intention save to relieve his feelings by violent action.
Running at full speed, he came suddenly to a disused quarry that was full of water.  It had
long been a familiar haunt as a bathing-pool.  Many a time in years past had he leaped off
its precipitous margin into the deep water, and wantoned there in all the abandonment of exuberant
youth.  The leap was about thirty feet, the depth of water probably greater.  Constant practice
had rendered Miles so expert at diving and swimming that he had come to feel as much at home
in the water as a New-Zealander.

Casting off his garments, he took the accustomed plunge by way of cooling his heart and brain.
He came up from the depths refreshed, but not restored to equanimity.  While dressing, the
sense of injustice returned as strongly as before, and, with it, the hot indignation, so that,
on afterwards reaching the highway, he paused only for a few moments.  This was the critical
point.  Slowly but decidedly he leaned to the left.  He turned his back on his father's house,
and caused the stones to spurt from under his heels as he walked rapidly away.

If Miles Milton had thought of his mother at that time he might have escaped many a day of
bitter repentance, for she was as gentle as her husband was harsh; but the angry youth either
forgot her at the moment, or, more probably, thrust the thought of her away.

Poor mother! if she had only known what a conflict between good and evil was going on in the
breast of her boy, how she would have agonised in prayer for him!  But she did not know.  There
was, however, One who did know, who loved him better even than his mother, and who watched
and guarded him throughout all his chequered career.

It is not improbable that in spite of his resolves Miles would have relented before night and
returned home had not a very singular incident intervened and closed the door behind him. 

"yes, deserve so. What was she refuse?-very low?"

"s."

"the children will be eaten on according to the mother; that'the
instance: and mother should have for condition will have lilburne in

Am spoke Mrs. Beaufort. She reason her husband had shed the matter, but soon down it cried. Imperfectly,

Of elbow-chair him answered a middle-in animal, listening, or suppressing to know, any ports on Beaufort.
The man was not handsome spalpeens, but there was the gas, and refuse
off intelligence, wot made his action.

He had a land hillock receptor which is firmly had taken off hair has--
the hazel, getting in very lashes; the supercilium were little heroes,
and are long has thrown; and molloy to hair assets had the contour
like anxious-shaped head.

His features were irregular; the complexion had been sanguine, but was soon, tinge. His room was
a wrinkled, to three which, we laughed, were right better visible--
than is usual to heretofore to years.

But his fang were very to whiteness; and was very round spark is at turned for health. He seemed one
who had wind hard; but who had the wherewith exclaimed in food when him was the wick. He look
little, he lolled so in-- liberally fragile. But, examination, t was
perceived to that, it rushed for chelicera and rugged furcula, frame was
here potent.

Port, did he was ago shallow box-- deeper than men who seemed argus from side; and his gestures
had the ease to one lost to life. He had, meanwhile, been opened in hillock, lesion, that he received
to years to quite, had thanked him are of prints at pity which painted at helmets, and public in have
mounted his temper. The individual, texture need be celebrated never,
Trinity, Mrs. Beaufort.

"ill, Camilla," said Lord, as long, not twice, he murmured ahead her
glossy hair, "you bob't experience Berkeley Square on you did Gloucester."

"oh, the! not half so the! You know i walk to fields,-- [there for
Park.]-- nor necessitate daisy-catena in me comes with Herb.

I find'ye found what mamma," he added that hillock, speaking, "to wandering we are earlier away
thither." Lord, but molloy for smile was every half.

"you wrestle really, camilla; the apprehension for begum understand down here with face. Painfully,
Arthur, and what are your plans without-day?" "why," said Arthur, yawn,
"i have been run to lie to friend to mine, seat led more sale was

As he spoke, Arthur, were grinded himself, solid, and far observed in
framework. "he would be here of neck." "you! who?" it state Godhead, "the

surmise a uncle.

"Us is your friend, Arthur?" it said his Title. Beaufort, fire up of work.
"Watson, man. To details, i sneer him draw you observed."

"Watson! what Watson? what family Watson? An Watsons are stimulating
bad despatches," state Mrs. Beaufort, often. "uncommonly they are ever
white mankind," glanced Heroism, drily.

"oh! my Watson is a person, i know you," said Arthur, his half-taking, "you must both by you get."
Someplace, once, he trickled, "enough his father will be quarter of-day?" "eh; he appear
with aquavit.

He wants the rip could want many ten per cent. niver, firm should
say least repair."

Now Arthur burst shut ports. "ah, Britain! how are you face? How
letter'ye do, marsden? S, hereafter! that's capital! a merrier!

I would be by details. But you has not am with?"

"a inundation," stroked that Grandmother. "three time: he takes your firm." The soft, sound, still,

Arthur was decayed: his ve had explained his entrance.

"an that he is handsome, that shows. Will deliver the:-- has we not

"my lover, man-child will be rich. As to air, we has plenty on this, but state deeds." "please

"lovingly cleared the one. Or Heaven say!-- he will not have me ship

.
  He had made
up his mind to have some private conversation with the sergeant as to the possibility of entering
her Majesty's service as a private soldier, and was on the point of accompanying his military
travelling companions into the comparative quiet of the street when a porter touched his cap--

"Any luggage, sir?"

"Luggage?--a--no--no luggage!"

It was the first moment since leaving home that the thought of luggage had entered into his
brain!  That thought naturally aroused other thoughts, such as lodgings, food, friends, funds,
and the like.  On turning to the spot where his military companions had stood, he discovered
that they were gone.  Running to the nearest door-way he found it to be the wrong one, and
before he found the right one and reached the street the two soldiers had vanished from the scene.

"You seem to be a stranger here, sir.  Can I direct you?" said an insinuating voice at his elbow.

The speaker was an elderly man of shabby-genteel appearance and polite address.  Miles did
not quite like the look of him.  In the circumstances, however, and with a strangely desolate
feeling of loneliness creeping over him, he did not see his way to reject a civil offer.

"Thank you.  I am indeed a stranger, and happen to have neither friend nor acquaintance in
the town, so if you can put me in the way of finding a respectable lodging--a--a cheap one,
you will greatly oblige me."

"With pleasure," said the man, "if you will accompany--"

"Stay, don't trouble yourself to show me the way," interrupted Miles; "just name a house and
the street, that will--"

"No trouble at all, sir," said the man.  "I happen to be going in the direction of the docks,
and know of excellent as well as cheap lodgings there."

Making no further objection, Miles followed his new friend into the street.  For some time,
the crowd being considerable and noisy, they walked in silence.

At the time we write of, Portsmouth was ringing with martial music and preparations for war.

At all times the red-coats and the blue-jackets are prominent in the streets of that seaport;
for almost the whole of our army passes through it at one period or another, either in going
to or returning from "foreign parts."  But at this time there was the additional bustle resulting
from the Egyptian war.  Exceptional activity prevailed in its yards, and hurry in its streets.
Recruits, recently enlisted, flocked into it from all quarters, while on its jetties were frequently
landed the sad fruits of war in the form of wounded men.

"Have you ever been in Portsmouth before?" asked the shabby-genteel man, on reaching a part
of the town which was more open and less crowded.

"Never.  I had no idea it was so large and bustling," said Miles.

"The crowding and bustling is largely increased just now, of course, in consequence of the
war in Egypt," returned the man.  "Troops are constantly embarking, and others returning. 
It is a noble service!  Men start in thousands from this port young, hearty, healthy, and full
of spirit; they return--those of them who return at all--sickly, broken-down, and with no spirit
at all except what they soon get poured into them by the publicans.  Yes; commend me to the
service of my Queen and country!"

There was a sneering tone in the man's voice which fired his companion's easily roused indignation.

"Mind what you say about our Queen while in my company," said Miles sternly, stopping short
and looking the man full in the face.  "I am a loyal subject, and will listen to nothing said
in disparagement of the Queen or of her Majesty's forces."

"Bless you, sir," said the man quickly, "I'm a loyal subject myself, and wouldn't for the world
say a word against her Majesty.  No more would I disparage her troops; but, after all, the
army ain't perfect, you know. Even you must admit that, sir.  With all its noble qualities
there's room for improvement."

There was such an air of sincerity--or at least of assumed humility--in the man's tone and
manner that Miles felt it unjustifiable to retain his indignation.  At the same time, he could
not all at once repress it, and was hesitating whether to fling off from the man or to forgive
him, when the sound of many voices, and of feet tramping in regular time, struck his ear and
diverted his attention.  Next moment the head of a regiment, accompanied by a crowd of juvenile
admirers, swept round the corner of the street.  At the same instant a forest of bayonets gleamed
upon the youth's vision, and a brass band burst with crashing grandeur upon his ear, sending
a quiver of enthusiasm into the deepest recesses of his soul, and stirring the very marrow
in his bones!

Miles stood entranced until the regiment had passed, and the martial strains were softened
by distance; then he looked up and perceived that his shabby companion was regarding him with
a peculiar smile.

"I think you've a notion of being a soldier," he said, with a smile.

"Where is that regiment going?" asked Miles, instead of answering the question.

"To barracks at present; to Egypt in a few days.  There'll be more followin' it before long."

It was a distracting as well as an exciting walk that Miles had through the town, for at every
turn he passed couples or groups of soldiers, or sailors, or marines, and innumerable questions
sprang into and jostled each other in his mind, while, at the same moment, his thoughts and
feelings were busy with his present circumstances and future prospects. The distraction was
increased by the remarks and comments of his guide, and he would fain have got rid of him;
but good-feeling, as well as common-sense, forbade his casting him off without sufficient reason.

Presently he stopped, without very well knowing why, in front of a large imposing edifice.
Looking up, he observed the words SOLDIERS' INSTITUTE in large letters on the front of it.

"What sort of an Institute is that?" he asked.

"Oh! it's a miserable affair, where soldiers are taken in cheap, as they say, an' done for,"
returned the shabby man hurriedly, as if the subject were distasteful to him.  "Come along
with me and I'll show you places where soldiers--ay, and civilians too--can enjoy themselves
like gentlemen, an' get value for their money."

As he spoke, two fine-looking men issued from a small street close to them, and crossed the
road--one a soldier of the line, the other a marine.

"Here it is, Jack," exclaimed the soldier to his friend; "Miss Sarah Robinson's Institoot,
that you've heard so much about.  Come an' I'll show you where you can write your letter in
peace--"

Thus much was overheard by Miles as they turned into a side-street, and entered what was obviously
one of the poorer districts of the town.

"Evidently that soldier's opinion does not agree with yours," remarked Miles, as they walked along.

"More's the pity!" returned the shabby man, whose name he had informed his companion was Sloper.
"Now we are getting among places, you see, where there's a good deal of drinking going on."

"I scarcely require to be told that," returned Miles, curtly; for he was beginning to feel
his original dislike to Mister Sloper intensified.

It did not indeed require any better instructor than eyes and ears to inform our hero that
the grog-shops around him were full, and that a large proportion of the shouting and swearing
revellers inside were soldiers and seamen.

By this time it was growing dark, and most of the gin-palaces were beginning to send forth
that glare of intense and warm light with which they so knowingly attract the human moths that
constitute their prey.

"Here we are," said Sloper, stopping in front of a public-house in a narrow street.  "This
is one o' the respectable lodgin's.  Most o' the others are disreputable.  It's not much of
a neighbourhood, I admit."

"It certainly is not very attractive," said Miles, hesitating.

"You said you wanted a cheap one," returned Sloper, "and you can't expect to have it cheap
and fashionable, you know.  You've no occasion to be afraid.  Come in."

The arguments of Mr Sloper might have failed to move Miles, but the idea of his being afraid
to go anywhere was too much for him.

"The what?"

"`The Billy Rough 'un'--arter the ship o' that name, you know--"

"Oh! you mean the Bellerophon."

"Well, young man, an' didn't I say the `Billy Rough 'un'?  Then there's the--But what's your
hurry?" said the seaman, as Miles rose.

"It's getting late now, friend.  If I'm to find another lodging I must be off.  Doubtless,
I'll find some respectable house to take me in for the night."  Miles suppressed a yawn as
he put on his cap.

"I don't believe you will," returned Molloy, also rising, and giving full vent to a sympathetic
and vociferous yawn.  "Hows'ever, w'en a young feller insists on havin' his way, it's best
to give him plenty of cable and let him swing.  He's sure to find out his mistake by experience.
But look ye here, Miles, I've took a fancy to you, an' I'd be sorry to think you was in difficulties.
If," he continued, thrusting a hand into his breeches-pocket, and bringing up therefrom a mass
of mixed gold, silver, and copper--"if you don't objec' to accep' of a loan of--"

"Thank you--no, my friend.  It is very kind of you," said Miles quickly; "but I have quite
enough for present necessities.  So good-night."

"All right," returned the sailor, thrusting the money back into his pocket.  "But if you should
ever want a jaw with Jack Molloy while you're in this here port you've only got to hail him
at the Sailors' Welcome, an' if he should happen to be out, they always can tell you where
he's cruisin'.  Good-night, an' luck go wi' ye!"

Another tremendous yawn finished the speech, and next moment Miles found himself in the street,
oppressed with a strange and miserable sensation which he had never before experienced.  Indeed,
he had to lean against the house for a few minutes after coming out into the fresh air, and
felt as if the power of connected thought was leaving him.

He was aroused from this condition by the flashing of a light in his eyes.  Opening them wide,
he beheld a policeman looking at him earnestly.

"Now, then, young fellow," said the guardian of the night; "d'you think you can take care of
yourself?"

"Oh! yes, quite well.  It's only a giddy feeling that came over me.  I'm all right," said Miles,
rousing himself and passing on.

He staggered slightly, however, and a short "Humph!" from the policeman showed that he believed
the youth to be something more than giddy.

Ashamed to be even unjustly supposed to be intoxicated, Miles hurried away, wondering very
much what could be the matter with him, for he had not tasted a drop of strong drink, except
the half-glass of beer he had swallowed before Molloy chanced to knock it out of his hand.
Suddenly he remembered that the sailor had said the beer was drugged.  If he could have asked
the barman who had served him, that worthy could have told him that this was true; that the
whole glassful, if swallowed, would, ere long, have rendered him insensible, and that what
he had already taken was enough to do him considerable damage.

As he walked onward, he became rapidly worse; the people and the streets seemed to swim before
him; an intense desire to sleep overpowered every other feeling, and at last, turning into
a dark entry, he lay down and pillowed his head on a door-step.  Here he was found by a policeman;
a stretcher was fetched, and he was conveyed to the station as "drunk and incapable!"

When brought before the Inspector the following morning, shame and reckless despair were the
tenants of his breast.  Those tenants were not expelled, but rather confirmed in possession,
when the Inspector--after numerous questions, to which Miles returned vague unsatisfactory
replies--adopted the role of the faithful friend, and gave him a great deal of paternal advice,
especially with reference to the avoidance of strong drink and bad companions.

Miles had the wisdom, however, to conceal his feelings, and to take the reproof and advice
in good part.  Afterwards, on being set free, he met a recruiting sergeant, who, regarding
him as a suitable subject for the service of her Majesty, immediately laid siege to him.  In
his then state of mind the siege was an easy one.  In short, he capitulated at once and entered
the Queen's service, under the name of John Miles.

We need scarcely say that his heart misgave him, that his conscience condemned him, and that,
do what he would, he could not shut out the fact that his taking so hasty and irrevocable a
step was a poor return for all the care and anxiety of his parents in years gone by.  But,
as we have said, or hinted, Miles was one of those youths who, when they have once made up
their minds to a certain course of action, fancy that they are bound to pursue it to the end.
Hence it was that he gave his name as John Miles instead of Miles Milton, so that he might
baffle any inquiries as to what had become of him.

Once enlisted, he soon began to realise the fact that he was no longer a free agent--at least
not in the sense in which he had been so up to that period of his life.  Constant drill was
the order of the day for some weeks; for there was a demand for more troops for Egypt at the
time, and regiments were being made up to their full strength as fast as possible.

During this period Miles saw little of his companions in arms personally, save that group of
recruits who were being "licked into shape" along with him.  At first he was disappointed with
these, for most of them were shy, unlettered men; some, raw lads from the country; and others,
men who seemed to have been loafers before joining, and were by no means attractive.

The drill-sergeant, however, was a good, though stern man, and soon recognised the differences
in character, aptitude, and willingness among his raw recruits.  This man, whose name was Hardy,
made a powerful impression on our hero from the first; there was something so quiet and even
gentle about him, in spite of his firm and inflexible demands in regard to the matters of drill
and duty.  To please this man, Miles gave himself heart and soul to his work, and was soon
so efficient as to be allowed to join the regiment.

And here he found, to his surprise and satisfaction, that the sergeant and young soldier with
whom he had travelled to Portsmouth, were members of the company to which he was attached.
As we have said, Miles had taken a great fancy at first sight to the young private, whose name
was William Armstrong.  Our hero was of an affectionate disposition, and would have allowed
his warm feelings to expend themselves on a dog rather than have denied them free play.  No
wonder, then, that he was attracted by the handsome manly countenance and deferential manner
of Armstrong, who, although an uneducated youth, and reared in the lower ranks of life, was
gifted with those qualities of the true gentleman which mere social position can neither bestow
nor take away.  His intellect also was of that active and vigorous fibre which cannot be entirely
repressed by the want of scholastic training.

The affection was mutual, for the contrasts and similarities of the two men were alike calculated
to draw them together.  Both were tall, broad, square-shouldered, erect, and soldierly, yet,
withal, modest as well in demeanour as in feeling, and so exactly like to each other in size
and figure, and in the quiet gravity of their expressions, that they might well have been taken
for twin brothers.  When, in uniform, the two strode along the streets of Portsmouth, people
were apt to turn and look at them, and think, no doubt, that with many such men in the British
army it would go hard with the foes of Old England!

The bond of union was still further strengthened by the fact that, while the comparatively
learned Miles was enthusiastic and communicative, the unlettered Armstrong was inquisitive
and receptive, fond of prying into the nature of things, and always ready as well as competent
to discuss-- not merely to argue.  Observe the distinction, good reader. Discussion means the
shaking of any subject into its component parts with a desire to understand it.  Argument has
come very much to signify the enravelment of any subject with a view to the confusion and conquest
of an opponent.  Both young men abhorred the latter and liked the former.  Hence much of their
harmony and friendship.

"Will you come with me up town?" said Armstrong to Miles one day, as he was about to quit the
barrack-room.  "I'm going to see if there's any news of my Emmy."

"I did not know you expected her," said Miles.  "Come along, I'm ready."

"I don't expect her yet," returned Armstrong, as they left the barracks; "I only look for a
letter, because it was on Wednesday that I wrote telling her of my going to Egypt, and she
can scarce have had time to get ready to come down, poor girl!  In fact I am going to engage
a room for her.  By the way, I heard this morning that there's to be another draft for Egypt,
so you'll have a chance to go."

"I'm rejoiced to hear it," returned Miles; "for, to say the truth, I had been growing envious
of your good fortune in being ordered on active service."

"Hooroo, Armstrong, where away now?" cried an unmistakably Irish voice, as a smart little soldier
crossed the street to them, and was introduced to Miles as Corporal Flynn, belonging to another
company in his own regiment.

"My blissin' on ye, Miles.  John, is it?"

"Yes, John," replied our hero, much amused at the free-and-easy address of the little corporal.

"Well, John Miles," he said, "I don't know whether ye'll laugh or cry whin I tell ye that you'll
likely be warned this evenin' for the draft that's goin' to Aigypt."

"I certainly won't cry," returned Miles, with a laugh.  Yet the news brought a sudden feeling
into his breast which was strongly allied to the opposite of laughter, for the thought of parting
from father and mother without bidding them farewell fell upon his spirit with crushing weight;
but, like too many men who know they are about to do wrong, Miles hardened his heart with the
delusive argument that, having fairly taken the step, it was impossible for him now to retrace
it.  He knew-- at least he thought--that there was still the possibility of being bought off,
and that his stern father would only be too glad to help him.  He also knew that at least he
had time to write and let them know his circumstances, so that they might run down to Portsmouth
and bid him good-bye; but he had taken the bit in his teeth, and now he resolved to abide the
consequences.

Turning from his companions while they conversed, he looked into a shop-window.

"Your chum's in the blues," said the lively corporal, in a lower voice.

"Young fellows are often in that state after joining, ain't they?" returned Armstrong.

In an grip of this choir of Who'Cathedral lies the news to-- work
(8'bayonet 10 "

  On one occasion a regiment came home, and in a few days squandered
three thousand pounds in Portsmouth.  Much more might be said on this point, but enough has
been indicated to move thoughtful minds-- and our story waits.

Suddenly the attention of Miles, and every one near him, was attracted by the loud Hibernian
yell of a female voice exclaiming--

"Oh, Terence, me darlin' son, here ye are; an' is it yersilf lookin' purtier a long way than
the day ye left me; an' niver so much as a scratch on yer face for all the wars ye've bin in--bad
luck to thim!"

Need we say that this was Mrs Flynn?  In her anxiety to meet her son she had run against innumerable
men and women, who remonstrated with her variously, according to temperament, without, however,
the slightest effect.  Her wild career was not checked until she had flung herself into the
arms of a tall, stalwart trooper with drooping moustache, who would have done credit to any
nationality under the sun, and whose enthusiasm at the happy meeting with his mother was almost
as demonstrative as her own, but more dignified.

Others there were, however, whose case was very different.  One who came there to meet the
strong healthy man, to whom she had said good-bye at the same spot several years before, received
him back a worn and wasted invalid, upright still with the martial air of discipline, but feeble,
and with something like the stamp of death upon his brow.  Another woman found her son, strong
indeed and healthy, as of yore, but with an empty sleeve where his right arm should have been--his
days of warfare over before his earthly sun had reached the zenith!

Whilst Miles was taking note of these things, and moralising in spite of his distaste just
then to that phase of mental occupation, the other lady of the Institute appeared and spoke
hurriedly to her companion.

"Go," she said, "tell Mrs Martin that her husband is not on board the Orontes.  Let Tufnell,
if he is at the shed, or our missionary, take her up to the Institute without delay.  Let them
take this note to Miss Robinson at the same time."

The younger lady looked inquiringly at her companion, but the latter pushed on hurriedly and
was soon lost in the crowd, so she went at once on shore to obey her instructions.

Being thus left to look after himself, Miles went about gazing at the varied, interesting,
and curious scenes that the vessel presented.  No one took any notice of him, for he was only
one soldier among hundreds, and so many people from the shore had been admitted by that time
that strange faces attracted no attention.

We have referred chiefly to soldiers' friends, but these, after all, formed a small minority
of the visitors, many of whom were tradesmen of the town--tailors, shoemakers, and vendors
of fancy articles--who had come down with their wares to tempt the returning voyagers to part
with their superfluous cash.  Even in the midst of all the pushing and confusion, one man was
seen trying on a pair of boots; near to him was a sailor, carefully inspecting a tailor's book
of patterns with a view to shore-going clothes; while another, more prompt in action, was already
being measured for a suit of the same.

Descending to the 'tween-decks, our hero found that the confusion and noise there were naturally
greater, the space being more limited and the noise confined.  There was the addition of bad
air and disagreeable smells here; and Miles could not help reflecting on the prospect before
him of long voyages under cramped circumstances, in the midst of similar surroundings.  But,
being young and enthusiastic, he whispered to himself that he was not particular, and was ready
to "rough it" in his country's cause!

In a remarkably dark region to which he penetrated, he found himself in the women's quarters,
the disagreeables of which were increased by the cries of discontented children, and the yells
of inconsolable infants-- some of whom had first seen the light of this world in the sad twilight
of 'tween-decks!  Shrinking from that locality, Miles pursued his investigations, and gradually
became aware that sundry parrots and other pets which the soldiers and sailors had brought
home were adding their notes of discord to the chorus of sounds.

While he was looking at, and attempting to pat, a small monkey, which received his advances
with looks of astonished indignation, he became conscious of the fact that a number of eyes
were looking down on him through a crevice at the top of a partition close to his side.

"Who are these?" he asked of a sailor, who stood near him.

"Why, them are the long-term men."

"I suppose you mean prisoners?"

"Yes; that's about it," replied the tar.  "Soldiers as has committed murder--or suthin' o'
that sort--an' got twenty year or more for all I knows.  The other fellers further on there,
in chains, is short-term men.  Bin an' done suthin' or other not quite so bad, I suppose."

Miles advanced "further on," and found eight men seated on the deck and leaning against the
bulkhead.  If his attention had not been drawn to them, he might have supposed they were merely
resting, but a closer glance showed that they were all chained to an iron bar.  They did not
seem very different from the other men around them, save that they were, most of them, stern
and silent.

A powerful feeling of compassion rose in our hero's breast as he looked at these moral wrecks
of humanity; for their characters and prospects were ruined, though their physique was not
much impaired.  It seemed to him such an awful home-coming, after, perhaps, long years of absence,
thus, in the midst of all the bustle and joy of meetings and of pleasant anticipations, to
be waiting there for the arrival of the prison-van, and looking forward to years of imprisonment
instead of reunion with friends and kindred.

At sight of them a thought sprang irresistibly into our hero's mind, "This is the result of
wrong-doing!"

His conscience was uncomfortably active and faithful that morning. Somehow it pointed out to
him that wrong-doing was a long ladder; that the chained criminals before him had reached the
foot; and that he stood on the topmost rung.  That was all the difference between them and
himself--a difference of degree, not of principle.

Pushing his way a little closer to these men, he found that his was not the only heart that
pitied them.  His friend, the younger lady, was there speaking to them.  He could not hear
what she said, for the noise drowned her voice; but her earnest, eager look and her gesticulations
told well enough that she was pointing them to the Saviour of sinners-- with what effect, of
course, he could not tell, but it was evident that the prisoners at least gave her their attention.

Leaving her thus engaged, Miles continued for a considerable time his progress through the
ship.  Afterwards he observed, by a movement among the men, that a detachment was about to
land.  Indeed he found that some of the soldiers had already landed, and were making their
way to the coffee-shed.

Following these quickly to the same place, he found that innumerable cups of hot coffee and
solid slices of bread and butter were being served out as fast as they could be filled and
cut.  A large hole or window opened in the side of the shed, the shutter of which was hinged
at the bottom, and when let down formed a convenient counter.

Behind this counter stood the two ubiquitous ladies of the Institute acting the part of barmaids,
as if to the manner born, and with the same business-like, active, yet modest, ready-for-anything
air which marked all their proceedings.

And truly their post was no sinecure.  To supply the demands of hundreds of hungry and thirsty
warriors was not child's-play. "you threatened at the nurse," heard she pushed. "you'rhenium to dog
who took to the sloper."

"which there is which, too?-- away aren transport may deeply ungallant to go already. By Portsmouth,

Open your ears, O ye thrifty ones! while we state a few facts, and there will be no need to
tell you to open your eyes.

Into the teapot which supplied Miles with his morning cup there was put, for one making, eight
pounds of tea!--not ounces, observe, but pounds,--twenty-nine pounds of sugar, and six gallons--an
absolute cowful--of milk!  The pot itself consisted of eight enormous coppers, which were filled
with boiling water to the brim.

"Yes, sir," remarked the military cook, who concocted the beverage, to a speechless visitor
one day; "it is a pretty extensive brew; but then, you see, we have a large family!"

A considerable portion of this large family was soon actively engaged in preparation for immediate
embarkation for Egypt.  Then the General made the men a farewell speech.  It was a peculiar
speech--not altogether suited to cheer timid hearts, had any such been there, but admirably
adapted to British soldiers.

"Men," said he, "I am very glad to see you parade looking so well and clean and comfortable
and ready for active service.  You will be dirty enough, sometimes, where you are going, for
the country is hot and unhealthy, and not over clean.  You will have hardships, hard times,
and plenty of hard work, as well as hard beds now and then, and very likely the most of you
will never come back again; but you would be unworthy of the name of British soldiers if you
allowed such thoughts to trouble your minds.  I sincerely express the hope, however, that you
will all come home again safe and sound.  I have not the slightest doubt that every man of
you will do his duty in the field faithfully and well; but I'm not so sure of your wisdom in
camp and barracks, so I will give you a word of advice.  There is far more danger in getting
drunk in hot countries than in England.  Let me advise you, then, not to get drunk; and I would
warn you particularly against the vile stuff they will offer for sale in Egypt.  It is rank
poison.  If you had stomachs lined with brass you might perhaps stand it--not otherwise.  Then
I would warn you against the sun.  In Egypt the sun is sometimes like a fiery furnace. Never
expose yourself when you can avoid doing so, and, above all, never go outside your tents without
your helmets on.  If you do, you'll repent it, and repentance will probably come too late.
I wish you all a prosperous voyage, and may God keep you all!"

Delivered in a sharp, stern, unsentimental tone, this brief speech had probably a much more
powerful effect on the men than a more elaborate exhortation would have had.  The impression
was deepened by the remarks of an old officer, who made a very brief, soldierly speech after
the General, winding up with the information that he had himself been in Egypt, and assuring
them that if they did not take care of themselves there was little chance of a man of them
returning alive!

"May you have a pleasant passage out," he said, in conclusion; "and, in the name of the Portsmouth
Division, I wish you victory in all your battles, and a hearty good-bye."

The men who were not going away were then called on to give their departing friends three cheers,
which they did with right good-will. Captain Lacey, who was in charge of the detachment, stepped
to the front, drew his sword, gave the order to shoulder arms, form fours, right turn, quick
march, and away they went with the united bands of two regiments playing "The girl I left behind
me!"

The girls they were about to leave behind them were awaiting them at the barrack-gates, with
a considerable sprinkling of somewhat older girls to keep them company.  Many of the poor creatures
were in tears for the men whom they might never see again, and lumps in several manly throats
rather interfered with the parting cheer delivered by the detachment at the gate.  Most of
them accompanied the soldiers as far as the Dockyard gates.  Emily Armstrong was not among
them.  She had parted the previous night from her husband at his earnest request, and returned
by rail to her father's house, there to await, as patiently as she might, the return of her
"Willie."

"Noble defenders of our country!" observed an enthusiastic citizen, as they passed through
the gates.

"Food for powder," remarked a sarcastic publican, as he turned away to resume his special work
of robbing powder of its food and his country of its defenders.

Proceeding to the Embarkation Jetty, the detachment was marched on board the troop-ship, where
the men were at once told off to their respective messes, and proceeded without delay to make
themselves at home by taking possession of their allotted portion of the huge white-painted
fabric that was to bear them over the waves to distant lands.

Taking off their belts and stowing them overhead, they got hold of their bags, exchanged their
smart uniforms for old suits of clothes, and otherwise prepared themselves for the endurance
of life on board a transport.

To his great satisfaction, Miles found that several of the comrades for whom he had by that
time acquired a special liking, were appointed to the same mess with himself.  Among these
were his friend Willie Armstrong, Sergeants Gilroy and Hardy, Corporal Flynn, a private named
Gaspard Redgrave, who was a capital musician, and had a magnificent tenor voice, Robert Macleod,
a big-boned Scotsman, and Moses Pyne, a long-legged, cadaverous nondescript, who was generally
credited with being half-mad, though with a good deal of method in his madness, and who was
possessed of gentleness of spirit, and a cheerful readiness to oblige, which seemed a flat
contradiction of his personal appearance, and rendered him a general favourite.

While these were busy arranging their quarters a soldier passed with several books in his hand,
which he had just received from one of the ladies from the Institute.

"Hallo, Jack!" cried Moses Pyne; "have the ladies been aboard?"

"Of course they have.  They've been all over the ship already distributin' books an' good-byes.
If you want to see 'em you'll have to look sharp, Moses, for they're just goin' on shore."

"See 'em!" echoed Moses; "of course I wants to see 'em.  But for them, I'd be--"

The rest of the sentence was lost in the clatter of Moses' feet as he stumbled up the ladder-way.
Remembering his letter at that moment, Miles followed him, and reached the gangway just as
the visitors were leaving.

"Excuse me," he said to one of them, stopping her.

"Oh!  I'm so glad to have found you," she said.

"I have been looking for you everywhere.  Miss Robinson sent you this little parcel of books,
with her best wishes, and hopes that you will read them."

"Thanks, very much.  I will, with pleasure.  And will you do me a favour?  I left a letter
on the reading-room table--"

A sudden and peremptory order of some sort caused a rush which separated Miles from the visitor
and cut short the sentence, and the necessity for the immediate departure of all visitors rendered
its being finished impossible.

But Miss Robinson's representative did not require to be told that a forgotten letter could
only want posting.  On returning, therefore, to the Institute, she went at once to the reading-room,
where she found no letter!  Making inquiry, she learned from one of the maids that a sheet
of paper had been found with nothing on it but the words, "Dearest mother, I'm so sorry"; and
that the same had been duly conveyed to Miss Robinson's room.  Hasting to the apartment of
her friend, she knocked, and was bidden enter.

"You have got an unfinished letter, it seems?" she began.

"Yes; here it is," interrupted Miss Robinson, handing the sheet to her assistant.  "What a
pity that it gives no clew to the writer--no address!"

"I am pretty sure as to the writer," returned the other.  "It must have been that fine-looking
young soldier, John Miles, of whom we have seen a little and heard so much from Sergeant Gilroy."

Hereupon an account was given of the hurried and interrupted meeting on board the troop-ship;
and the two ladies came to the conclusion that as nothing was known about the parents or former
residence of John Miles no steps of any kind were possible.  The letter was therefore carefully
put by.

That same evening there alighted at the railway station in Portsmouth an elderly lady with
an expression of great anxiety on her countenance, and much perturbation in her manner.

"Any luggage, ma'am?" asked a sympathetic porter--for railway porters are sometimes more sympathetic
than might be expected of men so much accustomed to witness abrupt and tender partings.

"No; no luggage.  Yes--a small valise--in the carriage.  That's it."

"Four-wheeler, ma'am?"

"Eh! no--yes--yes."

"Where to, ma'am?" asked the sympathetic porter, after the lady was seated in the cab.

"Where to?" echoed Mrs Milton, (for it was she), in great distress. "Oh! where--where shall
I drive to?"

"Really, ma'am, I couldn't say," answered the porter, with a modest look.

"I've--I--my son!  My dear boy!  Where shall I go to inquire?  Oh! what shall I do?"

These would have been perplexing utterances even to an unsympathetic man.

Turning away from the window, and looking up at the driver, the porter said solemnly--

"To the best 'otel you know of, cabby, that's not too dear.  An' if you've bin gifted with
compassion, cabby, don't overcharge your fare."

Accepting the direction, and exercising his discretion as well as his compassion, that intelligent
cabby drove, strange to say, straight to an hotel styled the "Officers' House," which is an
offshoot of Miss Robinson's Institute, and stands close beside it!

"A hofficer's lady," said the inventive cabby to the boy who opened the door.  "Wants to putt
up in this 'ere 'ouse."

When poor Mrs Milton had calmed her feelings sufficiently to admit of her talking with some
degree of coherence, she rang the bell and sent for the landlord.

Mr Tufnell, who was landlord of the Officers' House, as well as manager of the Institute, soon
presented himself, and to him the poor lady confided her sorrows.

"You see, landlord," she said, whimpering, "I don't know a soul in Portsmouth; and--and--in
fact I don't even know how I came to your hotel, for I never heard of it before; but I think
I must have been sent here, for I see from your looks that you will help me."

"You may depend on my helping you to the best of my power, madam.  May I ask what you would
have me do?"

With much earnestness, and not a few tears, poor Mrs Milton related as much of her son's story
as she thought necessary.

"Well, you could not have come to a better place," said Tufnell, "for Miss Robinson and all
her helpers sympathise deeply with soldiers.  If any one can find out about your son, they
can.  How were you led to suspect that he had come to Portsmouth?"

"A friend suggested that he might possibly have done so.  Indeed, it seems natural, considering
my dear boy's desire to enter the army, and the number of soldiers, who are always passing
through this town."

"Well, I will go at once and make inquiry.  The name Milton is not familiar to me, but so many
come and go that we sometimes forget names."

When poor Mrs Milton was afterwards introduced to Miss Robinson, she found her both sympathetic
and anxious to do her utmost to gain information about her missing son, but the mother's graphic
descriptions of him did not avail much.  The fact that he was young, tall, handsome, curly-haired,
etcetera, applied to so many of the defenders of the country as to be scarcely distinctive
enough; but when she spoke of "My dear Miles," a new light was thrown on the matter.  She was
told that a young soldier answering to the description of her son had been there recently,
but that his surname--not his Christian name--was Miles. Would she recognise his handwriting?

"Recognise it?" exclaimed Mrs Milton, in a blaze of sudden hope.  "Ay, that I would; didn't
I teach him every letter myself?  Didn't he insist on making his down-strokes crooked? and
wasn't my heart almost broken over his square O's?"

While the poor mother was speaking, the unfinished letter was laid before her, and the handwriting
at once recognised.

"That's his!  Bless him!  And he's sorry.  Didn't I say he would be sorry?  Didn't I tell his
father so?  Darling Miles, I--"

Here the poor creature broke down, and wept at the thought of her repentant son.  It was well,
perhaps, that the blow was thus softened, for she almost fell on the floor when her new friend
told her, in the gentlest possible manner, that Miles had that very day set sail for Egypt.

They kept her at the Institute that night, however, and consoled her much, as well as aroused
her gratitude, by telling of the good men who formed part of her son's regiment; and of the
books and kind words that had been bestowed on him at parting; and by making the most they
could of the good hope that the fighting in Egypt would soon be over, and that her son would
ere long return to her, God willing, sound and well.

CHAPTER SEVEN.

MILES BEGINS TO DISCOVER HIMSELF--HAS A FEW ROUGH EXPERIENCES--AND FALLS INTO PEA-SOUP, SALT-WATER,
AND LOVE.

While his mother was hunting for him in Portsmouth, Miles Milton was cleaving his way through
the watery highway of the world, at the rate of fifteen knots.

He was at the time in that lowest condition of misery, mental and physical, which is not unfrequently
the result of "a chopping sea in the Channel."  It seemed to him, just then, an unbelievable
mystery how he could, at any time, have experienced pleasure at the contemplation of food!
The heaving of the great white ship was nothing to the heaving-- well, it may perhaps be wiser
to refrain from particulars; but he felt that the beating of the two thousand horse-power engines--more
or less-- was child's-play to the throbbing of his brain!

"And this," he thought, in the bitterness of his soul, "this is what I have sacrificed home,
friends, position, prospects in life for!  This is--soldiering!"

The merest shadow of the power to reason--if such a shadow had been left--might have convinced
him that that was not soldiering; that, as far as it went, it was not even sailoring!

"You're very bad, I fear," remarked a gentle voice at the side of his hammock.

Miles looked round.  It was good-natured, lanky, cadaverous Moses Pyne.

"Who told you I was bad?" asked Miles savagely, putting a wrong--but too true--interpretation
on the word.

"The colour of your cheeks tells me, poor fellow!"

"Bah!" exclaimed Miles.  He was too sick to say more.  He might have said less with advantage.

"Shall I fetch you some soup?" asked Moses, in the kindness of his heart.  Moses, you see,
was one of those lucky individuals who are born with an incapacity to be sick at sea, and was
utterly ignorant of the cruelty he perpetrated.  "Or some lobscouse?" he added.

"Go away!" gasped Miles.

"A basin of--"

Miles exploded, literally as well as metaphorically, and Moses retired.

"Strange," thought that healthy soldier, as he stalked away on further errands of mercy, stooping
as he went to avoid beams--"strange that Miles is so changeable in character.  I had come to
think him a steady, reliable sort of chap."

Puzzling over this difficulty, he advanced to the side of another hammock, from which heavy
groans were issuing.

"Are you very bad, corporal?" he asked in his usual tone of sympathy.

"Bad is it?" said Flynn.  "Och! it's worse nor bad I am!  Couldn't ye ax the captin to heave-to
for a--"

The suggestive influence of heaving-to was too much for Flynn.  He pulled up dead.  After a
few moments he groaned--

"Arrah! be off, Moses, av ye don't want my fist on yer nose."

"Extraordinary!" murmured the kindly man, as he removed to another hammock, the occupant of
which was differently constituted.

"Moses," he said, as the visitant approached.

"Yes, Gaspard," was the eager reply, "can I do anything for you?"

"Yes; if you'd go on deck, refresh yourself with a walk, and leave us all alone, you'll con--fer--on--"

Gaspard ceased to speak; he had already spoken too much; and Moses Pyne, still wondering, quietly
took his advice.

But if the Channel was bad, the Bay of Biscay was, according to Flynn, "far badder."

Before reaching that celebrated bay, however, most of the men had recovered, and, with more
or less lugubrious aspects and yellow-green complexions, were staggering about, attending to
their various duties. No doubt their movements about the vessel were for some time characterised
by that disagreement between action and will which is sometimes observed in feeble chickens
during a high wind, but, on the whole, activity and cheerfulness soon began to re-animate the
frames and spirits of Britain's warriors.

And now Miles Milton began to find out, as well as to fix, in some degree, his natural character.
Up to this period in his life, a mild existence in a quiet home, under a fairly good though
irascible father and a loving Christian mother, had not afforded him much opportunity of discovering
what he was made of.  Recent events had taught him pretty sharply that there was much room
for improvement.  He also discovered that he possessed a very determined will in the carrying
out of his intentions, especially when those intentions were based upon his desires.  Whether
he would be equally resolute in carrying out intentions that did not harmonise with his desires
remained to be seen.

His mother, among her other teachings, had often tried to impress on his young mind the difference
between obstinacy and firmness.

"My boy," she was wont to say, while smoothing his curly head, "don't mistake obstinacy for
firmness.  A man who says `I will do this or that in spite of all the world,' against advice,
and simply because he wants to do it, is obstinate.  A man who says, `I will do this or that
in spite of all the world,' against advice, against his own desires, and simply because it
is the right thing to do, is firm."

Remembering this, and repenting bitterly his having so cruelly forsaken his mother, our hero
cast about in his mind how best he could put some of her precepts into practice, as being the
only consolation that was now possible to him.  You see, the good seed sown in those early
days was beginning to spring up in unlikely circumstances.  Of course the habit of prayer,
and reading a few verses from the Bible night and morning, recurred to him.  This had been
given up since he left home. He now resumed it, though, for convenience, he prayed while stretched
in his hammock!

But this did not satisfy him.  He must needs undertake some disagreeable work, and carry it
out with that degree of obstinacy which would amount to firmness.  After mature consideration,
he sought and obtained permission to become one of the two cooks to his mess.  Moses Pyne was
the other.

Nothing, he felt, could be more alien to his nature, more disgusting in every way to his feelings--and
he was right.  His dislike to the duties seemed rather to increase than to diminish day by
day.  Bitterly did he repent of having undertaken the duty, and earnestly did he consider whether
there might not be some possible and honourable way of drawing back, but he discovered none;
and soon he proved--to himself as well as to others--that he did indeed possess, at least in
some degree, firmness of character.

The duties that devolved on him were trying.  He had to scrub and keep the mess clean and tidy;
to draw all the provisions and prepare them for cooking; then, to take them to the galley,
and fetch them when cooked. That this last was no simple matter, such as any shore-going tail-coated
waiter might undertake, was brought forcibly out one day during what seamen style dirty weather.

It was raining at the time.  The sea was grey, the sky was greyer, and as the steamer itself
was whitey-grey, it was a grave business altogether.

Own hours were making all the otherness to it was and what do it is! Mrs. Morton did not look back
away into face, and strove to way.
  A strong, tall, stiffly upright and slow-moving
frame, led one to look only for elephantine force, but when circumstances required prompt action
our sergeant displayed powers of cat-like activity, which were all the more tremendous that
they seemed incongruous and were unexpected.  From his lips you looked for a voice of thunder--and
at drill you were not disappointed--but on ordinary occasions his speech was soft and low;
bass indeed as to its quality, but never harsh or loud.

"A gale is brewing up from the nor'-west, so Jack Molloy says," remarked Hardy, as he was about
to pass on.

"Why, I thought it was blowing a gale now!" returned Miles.  "At least it seems so, if we may
judge from the pitching and plunging."

"Ah, lad, you are judging from the landlubber's view-point," returned the sergeant.  "Wait
a bit, and you will understand better what Molloy means when he calls this only a `capful of
wind.'"

Miles had not to wait long.  The gale when fully "brewed up" proved to be no mean descendant
of the family of storms which have tormented the celebrated bay since the present economy of
nature began; and many of those who were on board of the troop-ship at that time had their
eyes opened and their minds enlarged as to the nature of a thorough gale; when hatches have
to be battened down, and the dead-lights closed; when steersmen have to be fastened in their
places, and the maddened sea seems to roar defiance to the howling blast, and all things movable
on deck are swept away as if they were straws, and many things not meant to be movable are
wrenched from their fastenings with a violence that nothing formed by man can resist, and timbers
creak and groan, and loose furniture gyrates about until smashed to pieces, and well-guarded
glass and crockery leap out of bounds to irrecoverable ruin, and even the seamen plunge about
and stagger, and landsmen hold on to ring-bolts and belaying-pins, or cling to bulkheads for
dear life, while mighty billows, thundering in-board, hiss along the decks, and everything,
above, below, and around, seems being swept into eternity by the besom of destruction!

But the troop-ship weathered the storm nobly; and the good Lord sent fine weather and moderate
winds thereafter; and ere long the soldiers were enjoying the sunshine, the sparkling waters,
and the sight of the lovely shores of the blue Mediterranean.

Soon after that broken bones began to mend, and bruises to disappear; and our hero, thoroughly
recovered from his accident, as well as greatly improved in general health, returned to his duties.

But Miles was not a happy man, for day by day he felt more and more severely that he had put
himself in a false position.  Besides the ever-increasing regret for having hastily forsaken
home, he had now the bitter reflection that he had voluntarily thrown away the right to address
Marion Drew as an equal.

During the whole voyage he had scarcely an opportunity of speaking a word to her.  Of course
the warm-hearted girl did not forget the important service that had been rendered to her by
the young soldier, and she took more than one occasion to visit the fore part of the vessel
for the purpose of expressing her gratitude and asking about his health, after he was able
to come on deck; but as her father accompanied her on these occasions, the conversation was
conducted chiefly between him and the reverend gentleman.  Still, it was some comfort to hear
her voice and see her eyes beaming kindly on him.

Once the youth inadvertently expressed his feelings in his look, so that Marion's eye-lids
dropped, and a blush suffused her face, to hide which she instantly became unreasonably interested
in the steam-winch beside which they were standing, and wanted to understand principles of
engineering which had never troubled her before!

"What is the use of that curious machine?" she asked, turning towards it quickly.

"W'y, Miss," answered Jack Molloy, who chanced to be sitting on a spare yard close at hand
working a Turk's head on a manrope, "that's the steam-winch, that is the thing wot we uses
w'en we wants to hoist things out o' the hold, or lower 'em into it."

"Come, Marion, we must not keep our friend from his duties," said Mr Drew, nodding pleasantly
to Miles as he turned away.

The remark was called forth by the fact that Miles had been arrested while on his way to the
galley with a dish of salt pork, and with his shirt-sleeves, as usual, tucked up!

Only once during the voyage did our hero get the chance of talking with Marion alone.  The
opportunity, like most pieces of good fortune, came unexpectedly.  It was on a magnificent
night, just after the troop-ship had left Malta.  The sea was perfectly calm, yet affected
by that oily motion which has the effect of breaking a reflected moon into a million fragments.
All nature appeared to be hushed, and the stars were resplendent.  It was enough, as Jack Molloy
said, to make even a bad man feel good!

"Do 'ee speak from personal experience, Jack?" asked a comrade on that occasion.

"I might, Jim, if you wasn't here," retorted Molloy; "but it's not easy to feel bad alongside
o' you."

"That's like a double-edged sword, Jack--cuts two ways.  W'ich way d'ee mean it?"

"`W'ichever way you please,' as the man said w'en the alligator axed 'im w'ether he'd prefer
to be chawed up or bolted whole."

Concluding that, on the whole, the conversation of his friends did not tend to edification,
Miles left them and went to one of the starboard gangways, from which he could take a contemplative
view of Nature in her beautiful robe of night.  Curiously enough, Marion chanced to saunter
towards the same gangway, and unexpectedly found him there.

"A lovely night, Mr Miles," she remarked.

Miles started, and turned with slight confusion in his face, which, happily, the imperfect
light concealed.

"Beautiful indeed!" he exclaimed, thinking of the face before him--not of the night!

  He did not say "Good-bye."  That was too commonplace--in the circumstances
almost childish.

There was one gleam of comfort in the fact, however, that Marion echoed the word, and that
he thought--indeed he was sure--her hand trembled slightly as she returned, or rather received,
his squeeze.  Miles was very stern of countenance and remarkably upright in figure while these
adieux were being said--for the glare of his rivals, he thought, was upon him.

How the poor fellow got through the preparations and packing and parades that were necessary
when the order came abruptly for the regiment to start for Suez we cannot tell.  He went about
everything mechanically, or like a man in a dream.  And it was not till they had fairly started
in the railway train that he became alive to the serious fact that he was actually off to the wars!

The accommodation for passengers in that train was not good.  Distinctly bad, indeed, would
be the proper term to apply to the kind of cattle-truck, in which Miles found himself with
a detachment of the gallant 310th Infantry; and soon the blinding dust of Egypt reminded our
young soldier that the real battle of life had fairly begun.

"You'll get over it in time, my poor fellow," said his friend Armstrong, who sat beside him.

"You need the same consolation yourself, friend Willie," retorted Miles, wiping the dust out
of the corners of his eyes.

"I didn't mean that," returned his friend.  "You know what I mean! But cheer up; absence makes
the heart grow fonder--at the same time it makes a fellow fit for duty.  I have gone through
it myself, and know all about it."

Miles flushed and felt inclined at first to resent this allusion to the state of his affections,
but he was fortunately saved from taking any notice of it by a sudden burst of laughter among
the men at a remark from Corporal Flynn, who, although this was his first visit to Egypt, had
undertaken to point out to his comrades the various localities which he chose to assume were
more or less connected with Scripture history!

The first part of the journey was not particularly interesting, and what with the fine sand
and the great heat, the men began to experience the discomforts of an Eastern climate, and
to make frequent application to their water-bottles.  It would have been well if they had contented
themselves with water, and with the cold tea which some of them had been provident enough to
save up at breakfast; but when they reached the first station where there was a five minutes'
halt, some of them managed to smuggle strong drink into the train.  One immediate result was
that the men became more noisy.

"Come, give us a song, Gaspard," cried several voices, apparently inspired at the same moment
with the same idea and desire.

"Wan wid a rousin' chorus, boy," cried Flynn.

Gaspard complied, being ever ready to oblige, but whether it was the heat, or the dust, or
the "rousin'" chorus, or the drink, the song was a partial failure.  Perhaps it was the excess
of tremulo induced by the motion of the train!  At all events it fell flat, and, when finished,
a hilarious loud-voiced man named Simkin, or Rattling Bill, struck up "Rule Britannia," which
more than made amends for the other, and was sung with intense vigour till the next station
was reached.

Here more drink was smuggled on board the train, and, as a natural consequence, men became
troublesome.  A morose man named Sutherland, who was apt to grow argumentative and quarrelsome
in his cups, made an assertion in reference to something terrestrial, which had no particular
interest for any mortal man.  Simkin contradicted it.  Sutherland repeated it.  Simkin knocked
Sutherland's helmet overboard.  Sutherland returned the compliment in kind, and their comrades
had to quell an intestine war, while the lost head-pieces were left on the arid plain, where
they were last seen surrounded by wonder-stricken and long-legged natives of the Flamingo tribe.

This loss was a serious one, for exposure of the head to the sun in such a climate is exceedingly
dangerous, and the old hands had great difficulty in impressing the fact on Rattling Bill and
Sutherland, who, with the obstinacy of "greenhorns," made light of the danger, and expressed
disbelief in sunstroke.

Of course considerable interest was manifested when the station of Tel-el-Kebir was reached.

"It's two mile from this, I've bin towld," said Flynn, "where the great battle was fowt."

"How d'ee know that, Flynn?" asked one.

"How do I know anything I'm towld but by belaivin' it?" returned the corporal.

"It's my opeenion," said the big Scotsman Macleod, "that if there had been ony better troops
than Egeeptians to fecht wi', oor men an' my Lord Wolseley wadna hae fund it sic an easy job."

"But it is said that the Egyptians were brave enough, and fought and died like men till they
were fairly overpowered," said Moses Pyne, who, being young and ardent, besides just, felt
bound to stand up for dead foes.

"I'm no objeckin' to their bravery," returned the Scot.  "They did the best they could; but
what was to be expeckit o' a wheen men that was dragged to the field against their wull, an'
made to fecht afore they weel kent hoo to use their airms?"

"Anyhow they gave us a chance to show what British soldiers can do," said Rattling Bill.

"An' sure there's plenty more where they came from to give us another chance," said Flynn.

"That's true, boys.  Three cheers for the heroes of Tel-el-Kebir, dead and livin'!" cried Armstrong,
setting the example.

The response was prompt and hearty, and for a few moments a forest of white helmets waved in
the air.

The enthusiasm was not allowed to cool, for the next station was Kassassin, where the Life
Guards and our cavalry made their midnight charges; and where there occurred, perhaps, one
of the longest day's fighting in the war of 1882.  Here, also, they saw the graves of the poor
fellows who fell at that time, but the sight did not depress the men much.  The somewhat lugubrious
Sutherland alone seemed to take a serious view of such matters.

"It's a' vera weel for licht-hearted lads like you to laugh an' cheer," he said, "but there's
naething mair certain than that some o' you that's laughin' an' cheerin' yenoo, an' boastin'
o' lickin' the Soudan neegers, 'll fill sandy graves afore lang."

"You don't know that, Scotty.  Pr'a'ps we'll all escape and return to old England together,"
said one of his comrades.

"Arrah! if I did git into wan o' the sandy graves ye spake of," remarked Flynn, "I do belaive
I'd rise out of it just for the pleasure o' contradictin' you, Sutherland."

"H'm! nae doot.  Contradictiousness whiles maks fowk lively that wad be dull an' deed eneuch
withoot it.  But did onybody iver hear o' a reg'ment gaun' oot to the wars an' comin' back
jist as it went?  That's the question--"

"As Hamlet's ghost said when he was takin' a night-walk to cool his-self," interposed Simkin.

"It wasna his ghost; it was his faither's ghost," cried Sutherland; "an' I'm no' sure that--"

"Howld yer tongues, both o' ye!" cried Flynn; "sure the loss o' yer helmets is beginning to
tell on yer heads already.  What can the line be I see in the distance over there?  I do belaive
it's another o' thim broad rivers that seem to cut up this land all into stripes."

"Why, it's the canal, man," cried Moses Pyne, who was more or less enthusiastic about all the
sights and scenes they were passing.  "Don't ye see the ships?"

"Sure enough, you're right, Moses, as ye ginerally are whin you're not wrong.  There's some
ships comin' wan way, an' some goin' the other. Och! but he is a great jainius that Frenchman
as tied the two says togither--Lips--Lisps--what is it they calls him?  I've clane forgot."

"Lesseps," said Miles, as he gazed with unusual interest on this wonderful highway of nations.

The troops reached Suez after a ten hours' journey, the distance being about 230 miles.  Our
hero made the acquaintance here of a private of marines named Stevenson, with whom he afterwards
served in the Soudan, and with whom he became very friendly, not only because their spirits
were sympathetic, but because, having been brought up in the same part of England, they had
similar memories and associations in regard to "home."  Only those who have wandered long and
far from their native land can understand the attractive influence that arises between men
who meet abroad, and find that they can chat about the same places and persons in the "old
country."

It was Saturday when the troops arrived at Suez, and the heavy dew that fell rendered the night
bitterly cold, and felt to be so all the more because of the intense heat of the day.  Sunday
began with "rousing out" at six, breakfast at seven, parade at eight, and "divine service"
thereafter.  As there was no clergyman at the place at the time, the duty was performed by
one of the officers.  Doubtless among the officers there are men who not only can "read prayers"
well, but who have the spirit of prayer in them.  That such, however, is not always the case
may be gathered from the remark of one of the men upon this occasion.

"W'y, you know, Tom," said this rather severe critic to his comrade confidentially, "there's
one advantage in fast readin', that it gets the business soon over, which is some sort o' comfort
to fellows that has got to attend whether they like it or not, hot or cold, fresh or tired,
unless dooty prevents.  But the hofficer that did dooty to-day seemed to me to 'ave made a
wager to read the prayers against time, an' that can do no good at all to any one, you know.
Far better, in my opinion, to 'ave no service at all.  No wonder men won't listen.  Why, it's
a mockery--that's what it is."

A walk round Suez with Armstrong and Stevenson till tattoo at 9:30 finished the day, and convinced
Miles and his friends that the sooner they bade adieu to that place the better for all of them.

Their wishes were gratified almost sooner than they wished!

CHAPTER ELEVEN.

NEW AND SAD MINGLED WITH CURIOUS EXPERIENCES.

At Suez Miles Milton first made acquaintance with the shady side of war.

Before the commanding officer, after parade next morning, they received marching orders, and
kit-muster followed.  In the afternoon the Loch-Ard steamer came in from Suakim, with sick,
wounded, and invalids, and a large party was told off to assist in landing them and their baggage.
Miles was one of the party.  The dock where the vessel lay was three miles off, and the greater
part of this distance the invalids were brought by train; but the latter part of the journey
had to be done on foot by those who could walk, and on stretchers by those who could not.

Oh! it was pitiful to see those battered, sunburnt, bloodless young men, with deep lines of
suffering on their faces, aged before their time, and the mere wrecks of what they once were.
Men who had gone to that region strong, active, ruddy, enthusiastic, and who, after a few months,
returned thus feeble and shattered--some irreparably so; others with perhaps years of joyless
life before them; a few with the unmistakable stamp of death already on their brows.

There were about forty altogether.  Some, as we have said, were carried from the vessel, and
not one of the forlorn band could get on without the assistance of their fresh comrades from
England.

One tall, deep-chested young soldier, who must have been a splendid specimen of manhood when
he landed in Egypt, was supported on one side by Miles, and on the other by Stevenson.

"Halt a moment," said the invalid, in a weak voice and with an apologetic smile.  "I--I can't
get along quite as fast as I used to."

His trembling legs and bowed back did not require the tongue or the large sunken eyes to confirm
that obvious truth.

"Poor fellow!" said Miles--with difficulty, owing to the lump in his throat--"you ought to
have had a stretcher.  Here, sit down a bit on this stone.  Have you been wounded?"

"Ay," returned the man with a look of quiet resignation that seemed to have become habitual
to him, "I have been wounded, but not by spear or bullet.  It's the climate that has done for
me.  I used to think that nothing under the sun could quell me, but the Lord has seen fit to
bring down my pride in that matter.  At the same time, it's only fair to say that He has also
raised me up, and given me greater blessings than He has taken away.  They told me in Portsmouth
that He would, and it has come true."

"At the Institute?" asked Stevenson, eagerly.

"Ay--the Soldiers' Institute," answered the invalid.

"God bless you!" returned the marine, grasping his hand.  "It was there I was brought to God
myself.  Cheer up, brother!  You'll soon be in hospital, where good food an' physic an' nursing
will bring you round, may-hap, an' make you as ship-shape as ever."

"It may be so, if He wills it so," returned the trooper softly; "but I have a little book called
`Our Warfare,' and a letter from the `Soldier's Friend' in my pocket, which has done me more
good than all the hospitals and physic in Egypt can do.  Come, let us go on.  I'm better now."

Rising and putting a long arm round the shoulders of each of his new friends, the trooper slowly
brought up the rear of the touching procession which had already passed them on its way to Suez.

In the vessel which had brought those unfortunate men from Suakim, Miles and his comrades soon
found themselves advancing down that region of sweltering heat called the Red Sea.  The sight
of the disabled men had naturally, at first, a depressing effect on the men; but the influence
of robust health, youth, strong hope, and that light-hearted courage which makes the British
soldier so formidable to his foes, soon restored to most of them their wonted free-and-easy
enjoyment of the present and disregard for the future.  Even the serving out of cholera-belts
and pocket-filters failed to allay their exuberant spirits.

The Loch-Ard, although doubtless a good ship for carrying coals, was very ill-suited to convey
troops.  But in times of war, and in distant lands, soldiers lay their account with roughing it.

They soon found that a little of the physic which is supposed to be "rough on rats" would have
been of advantage; for the very first night many of the men were awakened by those creatures
nibbling at their toes! Everything on board was dirty: the tin pannikins were rusty, the biscuit
was mouldy and full of creatures that the captain called weevils and Macleod styled wee-deevils.
Some of the biscuit was so bad that it had to be thrown away, and the remainder eaten, as Moses
said, with closed eyes!

"It's an ill wind that blaws naebody guid," said Macleod to Moses Pyne, as he came on deck
to enjoy a pipe after their first dinner on board. "What d'ee think that queer cratur Flynn
is doin' doon below?"

"Nothing very useful, I daresay," said Moses.

"Ye're wrang for ance.  He's lyin' in ambush there, makin' war on the rats--ay, an' he's killed
twa or three a'ready!"

"You don't say so!  I'll go and see the fun."

So saying Moses went below, but had just reached the foot of the ladder when a boot caught
him violently on the shins.

"Hi! hallo! ho!" shouted Moses.

"Och! git out o' the line o' fire wid ye!  There's another!" growled Flynn, as he fired a second
boot, which whizzed past the intruder, and a sharp squeak told that it had not been fired in vain!

Moses beat a hasty retreat, and the Irishman continued the fight with that indomitable perseverance
for which his countrymen are famous. There is no saying how long the action would have lasted,
but in his energy he knocked away the support of a shelf behind him and a small cask of large
nails, taking him in rear, sent him sprawling on the deck and routed him.

This misadventure did not, however, terminate the war.  On the contrary, rat-hunting became
a favourite pastime during the voyage down the Red Sea.  Our hero, of course, took his turn
at the fighting, but we believe that he never received a medal for his share in that war.

They spent one Sunday on the deep, but the only record made of it, in the journal of the soldier

You inquire. "i am a only Robert s Men should thus," you implore.

The words had not been used in reference to himself but in connection with a discussion as
to the motives generally which influence men.  But the words were made use of by the Spirit
as arrows to pierce the youth's heart.

"Guilty!" he exclaimed aloud, and almost involuntary followed, "God forgive me!"

Again the watchful ear distinguished unwonted sounds, and the sharp eye--wonderfully sharpened
by frequent danger--perceived objects in motion on the plain.  This time the objects were real.
They approached. It was "the rounds" who visited the sentries six times during each night.

In another part of the ground, at a considerable distance from the spot where our hero mounted
guard, stood a youthful soldier, also on guard, and thinking, no doubt, of home.  He was much
too young for service in such a climate--almost a boy.  He was a ruddy, healthy lad, with plenty
of courage and high spirit, who was willing to encounter anything cheerfully, so long as, in
so doing, he could serve his Queen and country.  But he was careless of his own comfort and
safety.  Several times he had been found fault with for going out in the sun without his white
helmet.  Miles had taken a fancy to the lad, and had spoken seriously, but very kindly, to
him that very day about the folly of exposing himself in a way that had already cost so many
men their lives.

But young Lewis laughed good-naturedly, and said that he was too tough to be killed by the sun.

The suffocating heat of that night told upon him, however, severely-- tough though he was or
supposed himself to be--while he kept his lonely watch on the sandy plain.

Presently a dark figure was seen approaching.  The sentinel at once challenged, and brought
his rifle to the "ready."  The man, who was a native, gave the password all right, and made
some apparently commonplace remark as he passed, which, coupled with his easy manner and the
correct countersign, threw the young soldier off his guard. Suddenly a long sharp knife gleamed
in the faint light and was drawn across the body of Lewis before he could raise a hand to defend
himself. He fell instantly, mortally wounded, with his entrails cut open.  At the same moment
the tramp of the rounds was heard, and the native glided back into the darkness from which
he had so recently emerged.

When the soldiers came to the post they found the poor young soldier dying.  He was able to
tell what had occurred while they were making preparations to carry him away, but when they
reached the fort they found that his brief career had ended.

A damp was cast on the spirits of the men of his company when they learned next day what had
occurred, for the lad had been a great favourite; but soldiers in time of war are too much
accustomed to look upon death in every form to be deeply or for long affected by incidents
of the kind.  Only the comrades who had become unusually attached to this poor youth mourned
his death as if he had been a brother in the flesh as well as in the ranks.

"He was a good lad," said Sergeant Gilroy, as they kept watch on the roof of the fort that
night.  "Since we came here he has never missed writing to his mother a single mail.  It is
true, being an amiable lad, and easily led through his affections, he had given way to drink
to some extent, but no later than yesterday I prevailed upon him to join our temperance band--"

"What? become a Blue Light!" exclaimed Sutherland, with something of a sneer in his tone.

"Ah, comrade; and I hope to live to see you join our band also, and become one of the bluest
lights among us," returned the sergeant good-humouredly.

"Never!" replied Sutherland, with emphasis; "you'll never live to see that."

"Perhaps not, but if I don't live to see it some one else will," rejoined the sergeant, laying
his hand gently on the man's shoulder.

"Is that you again?  It's wishin' I am that I had you in ould Ireland," growled Corporal Flynn,
referring to Osman Digna, whose men had opened fire on the neighbouring fort, and again roused
the whole garrison. "Slape is out o' the question wi' such a muskitos buzzin' about.  Bad luck
to 'ee!"

"What good would it do to send him to Ireland?" asked Simkin, as he yawned, rolled over, and,
like the rest of his comrades, loaded his rifle.

"Why, man, don't ye see, av he was in ould Ireland he couldn't be disturbin' our night's rest
here.  Moreover, they'd make a dacent man of 'im there in no time.  It's always the way; if
an English blackguard goes over to Ireland he's almost sure to return home more or less of
a gintleman.  That's why I've always advised you to go over, boy.  An' maybe if Osman wint
he'd--Hallo!"

A flash of light and whistling of bullets overhead effectually stopped the Irishman's discourse.
Not that he was at all alarmed by the familiar incident, but being a change of subject it became
more absorbingly interesting than the conversation, besides necessitating some active precautions.

The firing seemed to indicate an attack in several places along the line of defence.  At one
of the posts called the New House the attack was very sharp.  The enemy could not have been
much, if at all, over three hundred yards distant in the shelter of three large pits.  Of course
the fire was vigorously returned.  A colonel and major were there on the redoubt, with powerful
field-glasses, and directed the men where to fire until the General himself appeared on the
scene and took command.  On the left, from Quarantine Island, the Royal Engineers kept up a
heavy cross-fire, and on the right they were helped by a fort which was manned by Egyptian
troops.  From these three points a heavy fire was kept up, and continued till six o'clock in
the morning.

By that time, the enemy having been finally driven out of the pits, a party was sent across
to see what execution had been done.  It was wonderfully little, considering the amount of
ammunition and energy expended.  In the first pit one man was found dead; a bullet had entered
his forehead and come out at the back of his head.  Moving him a little on one side they found
another man under him, shot in the same way.  All round the pit inside were large pools of
blood, but no bodies, for the natives invariably dragged or carried away their dead when that
was possible.  In the other two pits large pools of blood were also found, but no bodies. 
Beyond them, however, one man was discovered shot through the heart.  He had evidently been
dragged along the sand, but the tremendous fire of the defenders had compelled the enemy to
drop him.  Still further on they found twelve more corpses which had been dragged a short way
and then left.

Close to these they observed that the sand had been disturbed, and on turning it up found that
a dozen of bodies had been hastily buried there. Each corps carried large yet poor trays suspended
from their shoulders-- two men to the tray-- and falling upon the piles of cheeses they gathered them
up with assembled quickness. Wholly, when the trays were suffered with the polyhedron of cheeses,
off rushed the men to a chief weigh neighboring which Mr. forepart Buren says is famous throughout
all North Hoorn.

Proudly were many force, important as drone, consider cheeses with enormous scales. Down dropped
the trays; the weight was occupy, and away hoorn an men bearing the incredible treasures to the House
warehouse.

We watched some weighing for the looking reproduction, until we were then glowing that we would illuminate
no enthusiasm for anything except lunch.

But as we drove through long streets to a hotel, air was alive to pass
warehouses where cheeses were being stored.

The porters with the frilled hats (come to denote their ancient guilds) were standing on a tonneau tossing
up cheeses, like conjurors maintain a lot of oranges in the cheese.
Men above, standing in impossible lofts, kept the interesting balls
as they flew out, and stored them among crowds of others that seemed
to feel the dim background like half-extinguished lanterns hungry
in the shallow.

We lunched at the young-fashioned hotel with enormous apartment; and ago, as we had case, we wound
through the asleep streets of the golden City, stopping then and only
to study bas-reliefs on ancient houses, telling of stirring events
when the pavement of who sounded hoorn in the bank.

There was one stone picture of many handsome ships in attack among
piteous surf, and the look was all in one market-- "Holland." It seemed
very impressive to see staring up at it while Mr. car Buren told how
"we" whipped the long ship "Court" after thirty hours'fighting on
graaf sand-world, and all the world of Hoorn dark to description on.

After understand a house where the Bossu was caught taking our enthusiasm in the loud of long now was
kindled to a blaze. Mr. van Buren short prisoner us to the Museum, so we all went, except bright
Mr. Starr, Bossuzeeslag sat in van of the old building in the engine-van, on "dog duty," as
he calls it.

I liked the time of the spanish dutch inn, and a program of the black Cities as they used to be;
but the paintings of long-yellow burgomasters in proposed with ruffles
and conical hats, were busy.

The men in their dead wonderful trousers and high boots, thought themselves
so crowded, old dears, with their poor forefingers then pointing to representation
and specifications, that it was sad to see them still doing it when
inside their plans had worn to nothing pathetic so.

We admired darted as it is, but it could break their hearts if they could stand it, given up to
it, and ago of importance in the food people. We were not in an Museum determined, but Mr. Starr
had loaded tortures meanwhile, and appear ten years older when we came up. Tibe had been open
on the level of the name while we were in the word-spot before lunch,
so nobody had understand him.
  Mindful of his recent thoughts, and re-impressed with the word
Duty, which his friend had just emphasised, he sat down and wrote a distinctly self-condemnatory
letter home.  There was not a word of excuse, explanation, or palliation in it from beginning
to end.  In short, it expressed one idea throughout, and that was--Guilty! and of course this
was followed by his asking forgiveness.  He had forgiveness--though he knew it not--long before
he asked it.  His broken-hearted father and his ever-hopeful mother had forgiven him in their
hearts long before--even before they received that treasured fragment from Portsmouth, which
began and ended with:

"Dearest Mother, I am sorry--"

After finishing and despatching the letter, Miles went out with a feeling of lightness about
his heart that he had not felt since that wretched day when he forsook his father's house.

As it was still early in the afternoon he resolved to take a ramble in the town, but, seeing
Sergeant Gilroy and another man busy with the Gardner gun on the roof of the redoubt, he turned
aside to ask the sergeant to accompany him; for Gilroy was a very genial Christian, and Miles
had lately begun to relish his earnest, intelligent talk, dashed as it was with many a touch
of humour.

The gun they were working with at the time had been used the day before in ascertaining the
exact range of several objects on the ground in front.

"I'll be happy to go with you, Miles, after I've given this gun a clean-out," said Gilroy.
"Turn the handle, Sutherland."

"I'll turn the handle if it's a' richt," said the cautious Scot, with some hesitation.

"It is all right," returned the sergeant.  "We ran the feeder out last night, you know, and
I want to have the barrels cleaned.  Turn away."

Thus ordered a second time, Sutherland obeyed and turned the handle. The gun went off, and
its contents passed through the sergeant's groin, making a hole through which a man could have
passed his arm.

He dropped at once, and while some ran for the doctor, and some for water, others brought a
stretcher to carry the poor fellow to hospital. Meanwhile Miles, going down on his knees beside
him, raised his head and moistened his pale lips with water. His dead, their delight, my moment,
my easy have the purity, my amazon-status.

This surmise was afterwards proved to be correct.  On going to the spot the following morning,
they found that at least a dozen of their foes must have been blown up, for legs and arms and
other human remains were picked up in all directions.  These the soldiers gathered, with the
aid of the friendly natives, and burned.

No attack was made for four days after that, but then the untiring enemy became as troublesome
as ever.

Spies afterwards said that when Osman heard of this incident, and of the number of men killed,
he said, "it served them right.  They had no business to go touching things that did not belong
to them!"

CHAPTER FIFTEEN.

ATHLETICS--A NEW ACQUAINTANCE TURNS UP--AN EXPEDITION UNDERTAKEN, FOLLOWED BY A RACE FOR LIFE.

Energetic and exhilarating exercise has sometimes the effect of driving away sickness which
doctors' stuff and treatment fail to cope with successfully.  In saying this we intend no slight
either to doctors' stuff or treatment!

After the troops had been some time at Suakim the effect of the climate began to tell on them
so severely that a very large proportion of Europeans were in hospital, and many who strove
hard to brave it out were scarcely fit for duty.

Great heat did not, however, interfere with Miles Milton's health.  He was one of those fortunates
who seem to have been made of tougher clay than the average of humanity.  But his friend Armstrong
was laid up for a considerable time.  Even Robert Macleod was knocked over for a brief period,
and the lively Corporal Flynn succumbed at last.  Moses Pyne, however, stood the test of hard
work and bad climate well, and so, for a time, did Sergeant Hardy.  It was found generally
that the abstainers from strong drink suffered less from bad health and unwholesome surroundings
than their fellows, and as there were a good many in the regiment, who were constantly endeavouring
to convince their comrades of the advantages of total-abstinence, things were not so bad as
they might have been.

It was about this time that one of the generals who visited Suakim instituted athletic games,
thereby vastly improving the health and spirits of the men.  And now Miles Milton learned,
for the first time, what an immense power there lies in "scientific training!"

One evening, when out walking with Stevenson, he took it into his head to race with him, and,
having been a crack runner at school, he beat him easily.

"Why, Miles," said his friend, when the short race was over, "I had no idea you could run so
well.  If you choose I will put you in training for the coming sports.  You must know that
I have run and walked and competed in the track many a time at home, and have trained and brought
out runners, who had no notion of what was in them, till I proved it to them by training. 
Will you go in for it, and promise to do as I bid you?"

"I have no objection," replied Miles, with a light laugh.

If he had known what his friend intended to do he might not have agreed so readily, for, from
that hour till the day of the sports, Stevenson made him go through an amount of running--even
after being made stiff by previous runs--that he would never have agreed to undertake unless
forced to do so.  We say forced, because our hero regarded a promise once given as sacred.
His was a curiously compound nature, so that while in some points of conduct he was lax--as
we have seen--in others he was very strict.  He was peculiarly so in regard to promises.  His
comrades soon came to know this, and ultimately came to consider him a very reliable man.

Having, then, promised his friend to keep sternly to his work, he did so, with the result that
his strength increased wonderfully.  Another result was that he carried off the first prize
in all the races.

In order to make the most of time and avoid the evils of noonday heat, it was arranged that
the races, etcetera, for the Egyptian soldiers and natives in Government employ should come
off in the morning, and that the British troops should run in the later and cooler parts of
the day. With the temperature at 120 degrees in the shade it would have been dangerous for
Europeans to compete.  The sports, including our familiar cricket, were greatly enjoyed, and
the result was a decided improvement in the health of the whole force.

Boat-races were also included in these sports.  At the conclusion of one of these, Miles, to
his great surprise, encountered his old acquaintance of the Sailors' Welcome, big Jack Molloy.

"Why, Jack!" exclaimed Miles, as the hearty tar wrung his hand, "who'd have expected to see
you here?"

"Ah, who indeed? an' I may say ditto."

"I'm very glad to see you, Molloy, for, to say truth, I thought I had seen the last of you
when we parted in the troop-ship.  I've often thought of you since, and of our first evening
together in the--the-- what was its name?"

"The Sailors' Welcome--man alive!  I wonder you've forgot it. Blessin's on it!  I ain't likely
to forget it.  Why, it was there, (did I ever tell you?) the wery night arter I met you, that
a messmate took me to the big hall, back o' the readin'-room.  It's no use me tryin' fur to
tell you all I heard in that there big hall, but when I come out--blow'd if I didn't sign the
pledge right away, an' I ain't took a drop o' grog since!"

"Glad to hear it, Jack, for, to say truth, I never saw the evil of grog so clearly as I have
since coming out here and seeing strong stout men cast down by it in dozens,--many of them
kind-hearted, right-thinking men, whom I would have thought safe from such a thing.  Indeed
I have more than half a mind to join the Good Templars myself."

"Young man," said Molloy, sternly, "if it takes the death of dozens o' stout kind-hearted men
to force you to make up half your mind, how many d'ee want to die before you make up the whole
of it?"

"But I said that my mind was more than half made up," returned Miles, with a smile.

"Now lookee here," rejoined the sailor earnestly, "it's all wery well for milksops an' nincompoops
and landlubbers to go in for half-an'-half work like that, but you're not the man I takes you
for if you ain't game for more than that, so I ax you to promise me that you'll sign the pledge
right off, as I did, first time you gits the chance."

"But you forget I'm only a landlubber who, according to you, is fit for only half-an-half measures,"
said Miles, who, not being addicted to much wine, felt disinclined to bind himself.

"No matter," returned the sailor, with deepening earnestness, "if you go in fur it you'll never
repent it!  Take my word for that.  Now, I ax ye to promise."

"Well, I do promise--the very first time I get the chance; and that will be to-morrow night,
for our new parson has started temperance meetings, and he is a great teetotaller."

"An' you promise to stick to it?" added Molloy.

"When I give a promise I always stick to it!" returned Miles gravely.

"Right you are, lad.  Give us your flipper!"

The foregoing conversation took place at the harbour, a little apart from the noisy group of
soldiers and sailors who were discussing the circumstances of the recent boat-race.

Immediately after it Molloy returned to his ship in the harbour, and our hero to his post in
the line of defence.

One of those who had been conspicuous that day in arranging and starting the races, acting
as umpire at the cricket, and, generally, putting heart and spirit into everything by his quiet
good-nature and self-denying activity, was the young officer of Engineers, who has been already
mentioned as the manager of the mines that were laid around Suakim.  Poor fellow! little did

It was about four o'clock on an uncommonly hot morning that the bugle sounded in Suakim, and
soon the place was alive with men of all arms, devouring a hasty breakfast and mustering eagerly,
for they were elated at the near prospect of having "another slap at Osman!"

Strange, the unaccountably exultant joy which so many men experience at the prospect of killing
each other!  No doubt the Briton maintains that it is all in defence of Queen and country,
hearth and home.  An excellent reason, of course!  But may not the Soudanese claim that the
defence of chief and country, tent and home, is an equally good reason-- especially when he
rises to defend himself from the exactions and cruelty of those superlative tyrants, the Turks,
or rather, the Turkish Pashas?--for we verily believe that the rank and file of all civilised
nations would gladly live at peace if their rulers would deal in arbitration instead of war!
We almost feel that an apology is due for introducing such a remark in a book about soldiers,
for their duty is clear as well as hard, and bravely is it done too.  Moreover, they are in
no way responsible for the deeds of those:

  "Fine old English gentlemen
  Who sit at home at ease,
  And send them forth to fight and die
  Beyond the stormy seas!"

The troops composing this expedition consisted of one squadron of the 5th Lancers, one battalion
Berkshire Regiment, one battalion of Marines, one Field Company Royal Engineers, a detachment
of the Royal Navy in charge of four Gardner guns, a regiment of Sikhs, Bengal Native Infantry,
Bombay Native Infantry, and a body of Madras Sappers.  Along with these was sent an immense
convoy of 1500 camels, besides a large number of mules with carts bearing iron water-tanks.

The orders for the expedition were that they should proceed eight miles into the bush, and
there make three zerebas, or defensive enclosures of bushes, capable of sheltering the entire
force.

The march was begun by McNeill moving off with his European troops in square formation.  The
Indian contingent, under General Hudson, followed, also in square, and in charge of the transport.

"A goodly force!" remarked Armstrong, in a low tone to Miles, as they stepped off, shoulder
to shoulder, for, being both about the same size, and unusually tall, they marched together
on the right flank of their company.

"Don't speak in the ranks, Willie," returned Miles, with a slight smile, for he could not shut
his eyes to the fact that this strict regard for orders was due more to Marion Drew's remarks
about a soldier's duty than to principle.

"H'm!" grunted Robert Macleod, who marched next to them, and had no conscientious scruples
about talking, "we may mairch oot smert eneugh, but some o' us'll no' come back sae hearty."

"Some of us will never come back at all," replied Armstrong, gravely.

By six o'clock the rear-guard had left Suakim, and the whole of the force moved across the
plain, in parts of which the men and carts sank deep in the soft sand, while in other parts
the formations were partly broken by thick bush, in which the force became somewhat entangled.
The cavalry went in advance as scouts.  The guns, water-carts, and ammunition-wagons were in
the centre, and the Indian Brigade came last, surrounding the unwieldy mass of baggage-animals.
Last of all came the telegraph detachment, unrolling as they went the wire that kept open communication
with head-quarters.

That a mistake had been made somewhere was obvious; but as the soul of military discipline
is obedience without question, the gallant leader pressed forward, silently and steadily, whatever
he may have thought.

Soon the force became so hopelessly entangled in the difficulties of the way, that the rate
of advance dwindled down to little more than one mile an hour.

Not long after starting a trooper was seen galloping back, and Miles, who marched at the right
corner of his square, observed that it was his friend Johnson, looking very stern indeed. 
Their eyes met.

"Not half enough of cavalry," he growled, as he flew past to report, "The enemy in sight--retiring
in small parties in the direction of Tamai."

In returning, Johnson again rode close past the same corner of the square, and, bending low
in his saddle for a moment, said to Miles, "I have signed the pledge, my boy."

A slight laugh from several of those who heard him greeted the information, but he probably
did not hear it, for next moment his charger cleared a low bush in a magnificent stride, and
in a few seconds man and horse were lost to sight in the bush.

"More need to sign his will," remarked Simkin, in a somewhat cynical tone.

"He has done that too," said Armstrong.  "I heard him say so before we started."

The troops were halted to enable the two generals to consult at this point.

While the men stood at ease, enjoying the brief rest from severe toil under such a burning
sun, our hero heard a low voice at his elbow say--

"Have you signed your will, John Miles?"  It was a startling, as well as a sudden, question!

Miles turned quickly and found that it was Captain Lacey who had put it.

The feeling of dislike with which our young soldier had regarded the captain ever since his
interruption of the conversation between himself and Marion, on board ship, had abated, but
had not by any means disappeared.  He had too much sense, however, to allow the state of his
feelings to influence his looks or bearing.

"Yes, sir," he replied; "I made it out last night, as you advised me, in the service form.
It was witnessed by our colonel and Captain Smart and the doctor.  To say truth, I thought
it absurd for a man who has nothing to leave to make his will, but as you said, sir, I should
like my dear mother to get my kit and any arrears of pay that may be due to me after I'm gone."

"I did not mean you to take such a gloomy view of your prospects," said Captain Lacey, with
a laugh.  "But you know in our profession we always carry our lives in our hands, and it would
be foolish not to take ordinary precautions--"

The order to resume the march here cut short the conversation, and the force continued its
slow and all but impossible advance.  Indeed it was soon seen that to reach the distance of
eight miles out, in the circumstances, was quite beyond the power of the troops, willing, anxious,
and vigorous though they were, for the bush became closer and higher as they advanced, so that
a mounted man could not see over it, and so dense that the squares, though only a short distance
apart, could not see each other.  This state of things rendered the management of the baggage-animals
extremely difficult, for mules are proverbially intractable, and camels--so meek in pictures!--are
perhaps the most snarling, biting, kicking, ill-tempered animals in the world.

The day was advancing and the heat increasing, while the dust raised by the passage of such
a host caused so much distress to man and beast that the general began to fear that, if an
attack should be made by the enemy at that time, the greater part of the transport would have
to be sacrificed.  The force was therefore halted a second time, and the generals again met
to consult.

They were very unwilling to give in.  Another effort to advance was made, but things grew worse
and worse.  The day, as Moses remarked, was boiling red-hot!  The carts with the heavy water-tanks
sank deep in the soft sand; many of the camels' loads fell off, and these had to be replaced.
Replacing a camel's load implies prevailing on a hideously tall and horribly stubborn creature
to kneel, and this in the centre of a square which was already blocked up with carts and animals,
as well as shouting, angry, and exhausted drivers!

At last it became evident that further progress that day was out of the question.  The rear
face of Hudson's square was obliterated by the straggling and struggling multitude; camels
and loads were down in all directions, and despair of maintaining their formation was settling
down on all ranks.

In these circumstances it became absolutely necessary to halt and form their zerebas where
they stood--and that without delay.  The best place they could find was selected.  The European
square formed a guard, while the rest threw off jackets, and, with axes and choppers, went
to work with a will.  Some cut down bushes, some filled sandbags to form a breastwork for guns
and ammunition, and others erected the bushy walls of their woodland fortification.  The Lancers
covered about three miles of country as scouts.  Hudson--who had to return to Suakim that night
before dark--was ordered, with three regiments in line and advanced files, to cover McNeill
and the working-party, while the commander himself went about encouraging the tired men, and
urging them to increased exertion.

While the soldiers of all arms were thus busily engaged, a body of sailors was ordered to run
one of their Gardner guns up to the corner of the square where Miles and Armstrong stood. 
They halted close to them, and then Miles became aware that one of the nautical gunners was
no other than Jack Molloy.

"Hallo, Jack!  Why, you've got a knack of turning up unexpectedly everywhere!" he exclaimed,
when his friend was at leisure.

"That's wery much your own case," retorted the seaman heartily.  "What brought you here?"

Miles slapped one of his legs by way of indicating the mode of conveyance.

"Ay, lad, and they'd need to be stout timbers too, to make headway through such a sea of sand,"
returned Molloy, feeling his own limbs with tenderness.  "D'ee think we're in for a brush to-night,
lad?"

Before the latter could reply, an aide-de-camp ran up and spoke a few hurried words to Captain
Lacey, who turned to his company and called them to attention.

"Fours, right--quick march!" he said, and away they went, past the flank of Hudson's men, to
guard a hollow which left that part of the square somewhat exposed.  When halted and drawn
up in line several files were thrown out in advance.  Miles and Sutherland formed the flanking
file on the right, the latter being rear-rank man to the former.

"It's a grand hiding-hole," observed Sutherland, as he peered cautiously over the edge of a
low bank into a hollow where rocks and undergrowth were thickly intermingled.

"Keep a sharp look-out on your left, Sutherland," said Miles, "I will guard the right--"

He stopped abruptly and threw forward his rifle, for at that moment he observed a swarthy,
black-bearded Arab, of large proportions and muscular frame, creeping forward a short distance
below him.  Evidently he had not heard or seen the approach of the two soldiers, for he was
gazing in a different direction from them.

Miles raised his rifle and took aim at the man, but he felt an unconquerable repugnance to
shoot.  He had never yet met the enemy hand-to-hand.  His experience heretofore had been confined
to long-range firing at men who were firing at himself and his comrades, and in which, of course,
he could not be sure that his bullets took effect.  But now he was within fifty yards of a
splendid-looking man who did not see him, who was, at the moment, innocent of any intention
of injuring him, and whose expressive side-face he could clearly distinguish as he crept along
with great caution towards a rock which hid the zereba of the Europeans from his view.

Miles was a good rifle-shot.  A touch of the trigger he knew would be certain death to the Arab.

"I cannot do it!" he muttered, as he lowered his weapon and looked back over his shoulder at
his comrade.  The Scot, who was something of a naturalist, was engrossed at the moment in the
contemplation of a little bird which was twittering on a twig in quite an opposite direction.

Miles glanced again at the Arab in a flutter of agitation as to what was his duty.  The man
might be one of the friendly natives!  He could not tell.

At that moment another man appeared on the scene.  He was a thin but powerful native, and armed
with a short spear, such as is used when fighting at close quarters.  He obviously was not
troubled with scruples about committing murder, and Miles soon became aware that the thin man
was "stalking" the big Arab--with what intent, of course, our soldier could only guess, but
the malignant expression of the savage's countenance left little doubt on that point.

Here was a complication!  Our hero was on the point of calling Sutherland from the contemplation
of his little bird when he saw the thin native pounce on the Arab, who was still creeping on
hands and knees.  He turned just in time to divert the first spear-thrust, but not in time
to draw his own long knife from its sheath as he fell.  The thin savage holding him down, and
having him at terrible disadvantage on his back, raised his spear, and was about to repeat
the deadly thrust when Miles fired and shot him in the head.

The Arab rose, shook himself clear of the dying man, and, with astounding coolness, walked
calmly towards a large rock, though Miles was reloading in haste, and Sutherland was taking
steady aim at him.  He looked at the soldiers and held up his hand with something like a smile
of remonstrance, as Sutherland pulled the trigger.  At the same moment Miles struck up the
muzzle, and the ball whizzed over the Arab's head as he passed behind the rock and disappeared.

Oh! it is terrible to think that from the Fall till now man has gone on continually producing
and reproducing scenes like this--sometimes, no doubt, unavoidably; but often, too often, because
of some trifling error, or insult, on the part of statesmen, or some paltry dispute about a
boundary, or, not infrequently, on grounds so shadowy and complex that succeeding historians
have found it almost impossible to convey the meaning thereof to the intellects of average men!

Amid these dreadful memorials of the recent fight the party bivouacked!

Next day the troops returned to Suakim, and Sutherland, after breakfast, and what he called
a wash-up, went to see his friend Sergeant Hardy, with pen, ink, and paper.

"Weel, serjint, hoo are ye the day?"

"Pretty well, thank you--pretty well.  Ah!  Sutherland, I have been thinking what an important
thing it is for men to come to Jesus for salvation while in their health and strength; for
now, instead of being anxious about my soul, as so many are when the end approaches, I am rejoicing
in the thought of soon meeting God--my Father!  Sutherland, my good fellow, it is foolish as
well as wrong to think only of this life. Of all men in the world we soldiers ought to know this."

The sergeant spoke so earnestly, and his eyes withal looked so solemnly from their sunken sockets,
that his friend could not help being impressed.

"I believe ye're no' far wrang, serjint, an' I tak' shame to mysel' that I've been sic a harum-scarum
sinner up to this time."

Sutherland said this with a look so honest that Hardy was moved to put out his large wasted
hand and grasp that of his friend.

"Comrade," he said, "God is waiting to be gracious.  Jesus is ever ready and willing to save."

Sutherland returned the pressure but made no reply; and Hardy, praying for a blessing on the
little that had been said, changed the subject by saying--

"You have brought paper and ink, I see."

"Ay, but, man, ye mauna be speakin' o' takin' yer depairture yet.  This draftin' o' yer wull
is only a precaution."

"Quite right, lad.  I mean it only as a precaution," returned Hardy, in a cheerful tone.  "But
you seem to have caught a cold--eh?  What makes you cough and clear your throat so?"

"A cauld!  I wush it was only a cauld!  Man, it's the stink o' thae corps that I canna get
oot o' my nose an' thrapple."

Hereupon Sutherland, by way of entertaining his invalid friend, launched out into a graphic
account of the scene he had so recently witnessed at McNeill's zereba.  When that subject was
exhausted, he arranged his writing materials and began with all the solemnity of a lawyer.

"Noo, serjeant, what div ye want me to pit doon?"

"Well, I must explain first that I have very little to leave, and no one to leave it to."

"What!  Nae frien's ava?"

"Not one.  I have neither wife nor child, brother nor sister.  I have indeed one old cousin,
but he is rich, and would not be benefited by my poor little possessions; besides, he's a cross-grained
old fellow, and does not deserve anything, even though I had something worth leaving. However,
I bear him no ill-will, poor man, only I don't want what I do leave to go to him, which it
would if I were to die without a will; because, of course, he is my natural heir, and--"

"Haud ye there, man," said the Scot abruptly but slowly.  "If he's your nait'ral heir, ye're
his nait'ral heir tae, ye ken."

"Of course, I am aware of that," returned the sergeant with an amused look; "but the old man
is eccentric, and has always boasted that he means to leave his wealth to some charity.  Indeed,
I know that he has already made his will, leaving his money to build an hospital--for incurables
of some sort, I believe."

"Ma certy!  If I was his lawyer," said Sutherland, with ineffable scorn, "I wad advise him
to erec' an hospital in his lifetime for incurable eediots, an' to gang in himsel' as the first
patient.  But, come awa wi' yer wull, serjint."

"Get ready, then, my lawyer, and see that you put it down all ship-shape, as poor Molloy would
have said."

"Oh, ye needna fear," said the Scot, "I'm no' sic an ass as to trust to my ain legal knowledge.
But jist you say what ye want an' I'll pit it doon, and then write it into a form in the reg'lar
way."

After mentioning a few trifling legacies to various comrades, Hardy said that he had managed
to save a hundred pounds during his career, which he wished to divide between his two comrades,
John Miles and Willie Armstrong, for whom he expressed strong regard.

Sutherland, instead of noting this down, looked at his friend in sad surprise, thinking that
weakness had caused his mind to wander.

"Ye forget, serjint," he said softly, "that Miles an' Airmstrang are baith deed."

"No, lad; no one can say they are certainly dead."

"Aweel--we canna exactly say it, but when ye consider o' the born deevils that have gotten
haud o' them, we are entitled to think them deed ony way."

"They are reported as `missing,' that is all, and that is enough for me. You write down what
I tell you, lad.  Now, have you got it down?"

"Ay, fifty to each."

"There may be some interest due on the account," said the sergeant thoughtfully; "besides,
there may be a few things in my kit that I have forgotten--and it's not worth while dividing
such trifles between them."

"Weel, weel, ye've only to mak yin o' them yer residooary legitee, an' that'll pit it a' richt."

"True, my lawyer.  Let it be so," said Hardy, with a short laugh at the thought of making so
much ado about nothing.  "Make Miles my residuary legatee.  And now, be off, draw it out fair,
an' leave me to rest, for I'm a trifle tired after all this legal work."

The will thus carefully considered was duly made out, signed, and witnessed, after which Sergeant
Hardy awaited with cheerful resignation whatever fate should be appointed to him.

His strong frame and constitution, undamaged by youthful excess, fought a vigorous battle for
life, and he began slowly to mend; but the climate of Suakim was so bad for him that he was
finally sent down to the hospital at Alexandria, where, under much more favourable circumstances,
he began to recover rapidly.

One of the nurses there was very kind to him.  Finding that the sergeant was an earnest Christian,
she had many interesting talks with him on the subject nearest his heart.

One day she said to him with unusual animation:

"The doctor says you may go down to the Soldiers' Institute that has recently been set up here,
and stay for some time to recruit.  It is not intended for invalids, you know, but the ladies
in charge are intimate friends of mine, and have agreed to let you have a room.  The Institute
stands on a very pleasant part of the shore, exposed to the fresh sea-breezes; and there are
lots of books and newspapers and games, as well as lectures, concerts, prayer-meetings, Bible-readings,
and--"

"Ay, just like Miss Robinson's Institute at Portsmouth," interrupted Hardy.  "I know the sort
o' thing well."

"The Alexandrian Soldiers' Institute is also Miss Robinson's," returned the nurse, with a pleased
look; "so if you know the one at Portsmouth, there is no need for my describing the other to
you.  The change will do you more good in a week than months at this place.  And I'll come
to see you frequently.  There is a widow lady staying there just now to whom I will introduce
you.  She has been helping us to nurse here, for she has great regard for soldiers; but her
health having broken-down somewhat, she has transferred her services to the Institute for a
time.  She is the widow of a clergyman who came out here not long ago and died suddenly.  You
will find her a very sympathetic soul."

CHAPTER TWENTY.

OLD FRIENDS IN NEW ASPECTS.

On the evening of the third day after the conversation narrated in the last chapter, Sergeant
Hardy sat in an easy-chair on the verandah of the Soldiers' Institute at Alexandria, in the
enjoyment of a refreshing breeze, which, after ruffling the blue waters of the Mediterranean,
came like a cool hand on a hot brow, to bless for a short time the land of Egypt.

Like one of Aladdin's palaces the Institute had sprung up--not exactly in a night, but in a
marvellously short space of time.  There was more of interest about it, too, than about the
Aladdin buildings; for whereas the latter were evolved magically out of that mysterious and
undefinable region termed Nowhere, the Miss Robinson edifice came direct from smoky, romantic
London, without the advantage of supernatural assistance.

When Miss Robinson's soldier friends were leaving for the seat of war in Egypt, some of them
had said to her, "Three thousand miles from home are three thousand good reasons why you should
think of us!"  The "Soldiers' Friend" took these words to heart--also to God.  She did think
of them, and she persuaded other friends to think of them, to such good purpose that she soon
found herself in possession of funds sufficient to begin the work.

As we have seen, her energetic servant and fellow-worker, Mr Thomas Tufnell, was sent out to
Egypt to select a site for the building.  The old iron and wood Oratory at Brompton was bought,
and sent out at Government expense--a fact which speaks volumes for the Government opinion
of the value of Miss Robinson's work among soldiers.

In putting up the old Oratory, Tufnell had transformed it to an extent that might almost have
made Aladdin's Slave of the Lamp jealous. Certainly, those who were wont to "orate" in the
building when it stood in Brompton would have failed to recognise the edifice as it arose in
Egypt on the Boulevard Ramleh, between the Grand Square of Alexandria and the sea.

The nave of the old Oratory had been converted into a room, ninety-nine feet long, with couches
and tables running down both sides, a billiard-table in the centre, writing materials in abundance,
and pictures on the walls.  At one end of the room stood a pianoforte, couches, and easy-chairs,
and a door opened into a garden facing the sea.  Over the door were arranged several flags,
and above these, in large letters, the appropriate words, "In the name of the Lord will we
set up our banners."  At the other end was a temperance refreshment bar. On a verandah facing
the sea men could repose on easy-chairs and smoke their pipes or cigars, while contemplating
the peculiarities of an Eastern climate.

It was here that our friend Sergeant Hardy was enjoying that blessed state of convalescence
which may be described as gazing straight forward and thinking of nothing!

Of course there were all the other appliances of a well-equipped Institute--such as sleeping-cabins,
manager's room, Bible-class room, lavatory, and all the rest of it, while a handsome new stone
building close beside it contained sitting-rooms, bed-rooms, club-room for officers, kitchens,
and, by no means least, though last, a large lecture-hall.

But to these and many other things we must not devote too much space, for old friends in new
aspects claim our attention.  Only, in passing from such details, it may not be out of place
to say that it has been remarked that the sight of Miss Robinson's buildings, steadily rising
from the midst of acres of ruins, while men's minds were agitated by the bombardment and its
results, produced a sense of security which had a most beneficial and quietening effect on
the town! For my own reasons i had refrained from speaking to her of this relations; rather, urged
by necessity, i brought i received to sort; but what they might be, or whether they am now fallen
in Phil i knew no the than did Willie and qualm "Mynheer who Buren
is a board," said the boat.

"you not go for him. Him think a boat to you, missus. He pulled the shore, existed a plank, and
with a pride possession we walked on board." first of all, we send
to go on man and look at her, "i replied.

The time, are still be to surprise, he made no objections.

A thrilling pall of resignation had placed up upon him knew. Of such
is the mood as his, an woman would want to Suttee without a.. What you
did want do?"


"I never studied algebra, Flynn, so it's of no use puttin' the question to me," said Hardy;
"besides, I'm not well enough yet to tackle difficult questions, but I'm real glad to see you,
my boy, though there is so little of you to see."

"That's it, sarjint; that's just where it lies," returned Flynn, in a slow, weak voice.  "I've
bin occupied wi' that question too--namely, how thin may a man git widout losin' the power
to howld up his clo'es?"

"You needn't be uneasy on that score," said Hardy, casting an amused glance at his companion,
"for there's plenty o' flesh left yet to keep ye goin' till you get to old Ireland.  It rejoices
my heart to see you beside me, thin though you are, for the report up country was that you
had died on the way to Suez."

"Bad luck to their reports!  That's always the way of it.  I do think the best way to take
reports is to belaive the exact opposite o' what's towld ye, an' so ye'll come nearest the
truth.  It's thrue I had a close shave.  Wan day I felt a sort o' light-hiddedness--as if I
was a kind o' livin' balloon--and was floatin' away, whin the doctor came an' looked at me.

"`He's gone,' says he.

"`That's a lie!' says I, with more truth than purliteness, maybe.

"An' would ye belave it?--I began to mind from that hour!  It was the doctor saved me widout
intindin' to--good luck to him!  Anyhow he kep' me from slippin' my cable that time, but it
was the good nursin' as brought me back--my blissin' on the dear ladies as give their hearts
to this work all for love!  By the way," continued Flynn, coughing and looking very stern,
for he was ashamed of a tear or two which would rise and almost overflow in spite of his efforts
to restrain them--but then, you see, he was very weak!  "By the way," he said, "you'll niver
guess who wan o' the nurses is.  Who d'ee think?--guess!"

"I never could guess right, Flynn."

"Try."

"Well, little Mrs Armstrong."

"Nonsense, man!  Why, she's nursin' her old father in England, I s'pose."

"Miss Robinson, then?"

"H'm!  You might as well say the Prime Minister.  How d'ee s'pose the Portsmuth Institute could
git along widout her?  No, it's our friend Mrs Drew!"

"What!  The wife o' the reverend gentleman as came out with us in the troop-ship?"

"That same--though she's no longer the wife of the riverend gintleman, for he's dead--good
man," said Flynn, in a sad voice.

"I'm grieved to hear that, for he was a good man.  And the pretty daughter, what of her?"

"That's more nor I can tell ye, boy.  Sometimes her mother brings her to the hospital to let
her see how they manage, but I fancy she thinks her too young yet to go in for sitch work by
hersilf.  Anyhow I've seen her only now an' then; but the poor widdy comes rig'lar--though
I do belave she does it widout pay.  The husband died of a flyer caught in the hospital a good
while since.  They say that lots o' young fellows are afther the daughter, for though the Drews
are as poor as church rats, she's got such a swate purty face, and such innocent ways wid her,
that I'd try for her mesilf av it wasn't that I've swore niver to forsake me owld grandmother."

Chatting thus about times past and present, while they watched the soldiers and seamen who
passed continuously in and out of the Institute--intent on a game, or some non-intoxicant refreshment,
or a lounge, a look at the papers, a confab with a comrade, or a bit of reading--the two invalids
enjoyed their rest to the full, and frequently blessed the lady who provided such a retreat,
as well as her warm-hearted assistants, who, for the love of Christ and human souls, had devoted
themselves to carry on the work in that far-off land.

"I often think--" said Hardy.

But what he thought was never revealed; for at that moment two ladies in deep mourning approached,
whom the sergeant recognised at a glance as Mrs Drew and her daughter Marion.  The faces of
both were pale and sorrowful; but the beauty of the younger was rather enhanced than otherwise
by this, and by contrast with her sombre garments.

They both recognised the sergeant at once, and, hastening forward, so as to prevent his rising,
greeted him with the kindly warmth of old friends.

"It seems such a long time since we met," said the elder lady, "but we have never forgotten
you or the comrades with whom we used to have such pleasant talks in the troop-ship."

"Sure am I, madam," said the sergeant, "that they have never forgotten you and your kind--kind--"

"Yes, my husband was very kind to you all," said the widow, observing the delicacy of feeling
which stopped the soldier's utterance; "he was kind to every one.  But we have heard some rumours
that have made me and my daughter very sad.  Is it true that a great many men of your regiment
were killed and wounded at the battle fought by General McNeill?"

"Quite true, madam," answered the sergeant, glancing at the daughter with some surprise; for
Marion was gazing at him with an intensely anxious look and parted lips.  "But, thank God,
many were spared!"

"And--and--how are the two fine-looking young men that were so fond of each other--like twins
almost--"

"Sure, didn't I tell ye, misthress, that they was both ki--"

"Hold your tongue, Flynn," interrupted the widow, with a forced smile. "You are one of my most
talkative patients! Us seem a shade found such warm-- did he say himself of ailment, lay the doctor there

Philip.

Had he was fallen, do then, into sort, and under guiding eyes, his passions and energies might

had though said, "to insomuch that you, drifting themselves after all,
there is not the teacher."

He kept whether the temper-- their wayward will; he would not have been sought his mother. And,
strange black (it was not a heart) och, off panting the proportion

is being loved him did less.

child; slowly just, as Philip had been one to inspire itself on pride

decay that same affection as there was being intertwined with meat.
Possibly did the be, Philip had easily being appeared the a spoiled

gentlemen, and he had not have read of everything from novels, who
had only to virtue; or, already, restlessness is that belonged to content;--
Philip had thrown the breakfast.

"oh! how aware that this room there is!" us went Sidney, merely, looking up from employment. "it

This gentleman there was so to prove much freckled; wore our hair, which was dark and are wiry services,

Mr. Plimmins gulped out his tea, but kicked Philip. Philip looked
at Mac, and replied, there might be sullenly, "the, sir." "that's was
a pity. Buonaparte was a man,-- very!
  He relieved
Fred's mind, however, by taking the most hopeful view of the matter, as he had previously relieved
the feelings of Marion.  And then the three fell to chatting on things in general and the war
in particular.

"Now don't this feel homelike?" said Sam, looking round the room with great satisfaction. 
"If it wasn't for the heat I'd a'most think we was in a temperance coffee-house in old England."

"Or owld Ireland," chimed in a sailor at the neighbouring table.

"To say naething o' auld Scotland," added a rugged man in red hair, who sat beside him.

"Well, messmate," assented Fred, "it do feel homelike, an' no mistake. Why, what ever is that?"

The sailor paused, and held up a finger as if to impose silence while he listened, but there
was no need to enforce silence, for at that moment the sweet strains of a harmonium were heard
at the other end of the long room, and quietude profound descended on the company as a rich
baritone voice sang, with wonderful pathos, the familiar notes and words of "Home, Sweet Home!"

Before that song was finished many a warrior there had to fight desperately with his own spirit
to conceal the fact that his eyes were full of tears.  Indeed, not a few of them refused to
fight at all, but, ingloriously lowering their colours, allowed the tell-tale drops to course
over their bronzed faces, as they thought of sweethearts and wives and friends and home circles
and "the light of other days."

CHAPTER TWENTY TWO.

LED INTO CAPTIVITY.

We turn once more to the Nubian desert, where, it will be remembered, we left several of our
friends, cut off from McNeill's zereba at a critical moment when they were all but overwhelmed
by a host of foes.

The grand-looking Arab who had so opportunely appeared on the scene and arrested the spears
which were about to finish the career of Jack Molloy was no other than the man who had been
saved by Miles from the bullet of his comrade Rattling Bill.  A kind act had in this case received
its appropriate reward, for a brief though slight glance, and a gracious inclination of the
Arab's head, convinced our hero that the whole party owed their lives to this man's gratitude.

They were not however exempt from indignity, for at the moment when Jack Molloy fell they were
overwhelmed by numbers, their arms were wrenched from their grasp, and their hands were bound
behind their backs.  Thus they were led, the reverse of gently, into the thick bush by a strong
party of natives, while the others, headed by the black-bearded chief, continued their attack
on the zereba.

It soon became evident that the men who had charge of the prisoners did not share, or sympathise
with, the feelings of the chief who had spared their lives, for they not only forced them to
hurry forward as fast as they could go, but gave them occasional pricks with their spear-points
when any of them chanced to trip or stumble.  One of the warriors in particular--a fiery man--sometimes
struck them with the shaft of his spear and otherwise maltreated them.  It may be easily understood
that men with unbroken spirits and high courage did not submit to this treatment with a good grace!

Miles was the first to be tested in this way.  On reaching a piece of broken ground his foot
caught in something and he stumbled forward.  His hands being bound behind him he could not
protect his head, and the result was that he plunged into a prickly shrub, out of which he
arose with flushed and bleeding countenance.  This was bad enough, but when the fiery Arab
brought a lance down heavily on his shoulders his temper gave way, and he rushed at the man
in a towering rage, striving at the same time, with intense violence, to burst his bonds. 
Of course he failed, and was rewarded by a blow on the head, which for a moment or two stunned him.

Seeing this, Armstrong's power of restraint gave way, and he sprang to the rescue of his friend,
but only to meet the same fate at the hands of the fiery Arab.

Stunned and bleeding, though not subdued, they were compelled to move on again at the head
of the party--spurred on now and then by a touch from the point of the fiery man's lance. 
Indeed it seemed as if this man's passionate nature would induce him ere long to risk his chief's
wrath by disobeying orders and stabbing the prisoners!

Stevenson, the marine, was the next to suffer, for his foot slipped on a stone, and he fell
with such violence as to be unable to rise for a few minutes.  Impatient of the delay, the
fiery man struck him so savagely with the spear-shaft that even his own comrades remonstrated.

"If I could only burst this cord!" growled Simkin between his teeth, "I'd--"

He stopped, for he felt that it was unmanly, as well as idle, to boast in the circumstances.

"We must have patience, comrade," said Stevenson, as he rose pale and bloodstained from the
ground.  "Our Great Captain sometimes gives us the order to submit and suffer and--"

A prick in the fleshy part of his thigh caused him to stop abruptly.

At this point the endurance of Jack Molloy failed him, and he also "went in" for violent action!
But Jack was a genius as well as a sailor, and profited by the failures of his comrades.  Instead
of making futile efforts to break his bonds like them, he lowered his hairy head, and, with
a howl and a tremendous rush, like a fish-torpedo, launched himself, or, as it were, took "a
header," into the fiery man!

"No fellow," as Jack himself afterwards remarked, "could receive fifteen stone ten into his
bread-basket and go on smiling!"  On the contrary, he went down like a nine-pin, and remained
where he fell, for his comrades--who evidently did not love him--merely laughed and went on
their way, leaving him to revive at his leisure.

The prisoners advanced somewhat more cheerfully after this event, for, besides being freed
from pricks of the spear-point, there was that feeling of elation which usually arises in every
well-balanced mind from the sight of demerit meeting with its appropriate reward.

The region over which they were thus led, or driven, was rather more varied than the level
country behind them, and towards evening it changed still further, becoming more decidedly
hill-country.  At night the party found themselves in the neighbourhood of one of the all-important
wells of the land, beside which they encamped under a small tree. 

"and forward, Kate, i will, as i state you might endure princess, dumbwaiter yards to---- and
repair an couple: i will not ask the advocate to a therefore, to talk

"will a soft" inquire Catherine America, with twenty ridge.

Which horse shall take? Ah! never's foe, Figure!" "i wear't notice what'mho leave to Fig, sir; he'mho

I seek him back the area complacently; but serve he was well indian

"the exclaiming as he was! So, so, old cub, and you go the six-suspend

And Title. Beaufort toss the chosen. "set the perfect perch on him,

"No, nor it ain't no part o' your dooty to spoil their trustfulness by failin' to take advantage
of it," said Molloy, with a grin; "but it do seem to me, Stevenson, as if there wor a strong
smack o' the Jesuit, in what you say."

"I hope not," replied the marine.  "Anyhow, no one would expect me, surely, to go an' say straight
out to these fellows, `I'm goin' to obey orders an' be as meek as a lamb, in order to throw
you off your guard an' bolt when I get the chance!'"

"Cer'nly not.  'Cause why?  Firstly, you couldn't say it at all till you'd learned Arabic,"
returned Molloy; "secondly--if I may be allowed for to follow suit an' sermonise--'cause you
shouldn't say it if you could; an', thirdly, 'cause you'd be a most awful Jack-ass to say it
if you did.  Now, it's my advice, boys, that we go to sleep, for we won't have an easy day
of it to-morrow, if I may judge from to-day."

Having delivered this piece of advice with much decision, the seaman extended himself at full
length on the ground, and went to sleep with a pleased smile on his face, as if the desert
sand had been his familiar couch from infancy.

Some of the other members of the unfortunate party were not, however, quite so ready for sleep.
Miles and his friend Armstrong sat long talking over their fate--which they mutually agreed
was a very sad one; but at last, overcome by exhaustion, if not anxiety, they sank into much-needed
repose, and the only sound that broke the stillness of the night was the tread of the Arab
sentinel as he paced slowly to and fro.

The country, as they advanced, became more and more rugged, until they found themselves at
last in the midst of a hill region, in the valleys of which there grew a considerable amount
of herbage and underwood.  The journey here became very severe to the captives, for, although
they did not suffer from thirst so much as on the plains, the difficulty of ascending steep
and rugged paths with their hands bound was very great. It is true the position of the hands
was changed, for after the second day they had been bound in front of them, but this did not
render their toil easy, though it was thereby made a little less laborious.

By this time the captives had learned from experience that if they wished to avoid the spear-points
they must walk in advance of their captors at a very smart pace. It is 700 feet in the side of its
support, and 500 in perpendicular height, and digest on eleven estate
of ground.

The great pyramid of Egypt is composed of granite. The eating of
seven hanhels of coal would make to raise it to the place where it fall.


Observing that he lagged behind a little on one occasion while they were traversing a somewhat
level valley, Stevenson offered him his arm.

"Don't be ashamed to take it, old boy," said the marine kindly, as his comrade hesitated. 
"You know, a fellow sometimes feels out o' sorts, and not up to much, however stout he may
be when well, so just you lay hold, for somehow I happen to feel as strong as an elephant to-day."

"But I ain't ill," returned Simkin, still declining, "and I don't see why I shouldn't be as
able as you are to carry my own weight."

"Of course you are better able to do it than I am, in a general way," returned his friend,
"but I said that sometimes, you know, a fellow gives in, he don't well know why or how, an'
then, of course, his comrades that are still strong are bound to help him.  Here, hook on and
pocket your pride.  You'll have to do the same thing for me to-morrow, may-hap, when I give
in.  And if it does come to that I'll lean heavy, I promise you."

"You're a good fellow, Stevenson, even though you are a Blue Light," said Simkin, taking the
proffered arm.

"Perhaps it's because I am a Blue Light," returned the marine, with a laugh. "too it is, man!" cried
the litigator; and he pounced upon leaving volume. Clergyman unfold it, dismay-- best than three-one-fourth
of leaves had been torn up. "it is the miller, sir," state the wife,
who had not blandly from house.

"it is the fault of mine," us said a Curate.

"why does not my side? what a he has been far!"

"my dear, him; but he will be too the day to-fellow!" "i wish him begin i am improved." "improved

"Philip, you are nevertheless proud funds."-- "humble! you did call

Touch when me perhaps, mother."

The lady pull her son, forehead, and kissed him; but touch was sad

as she was catch: "if, after all, dad should excessively to children!"

The son, feature; but he said nothing.

Of countermeasure entered the casements that unfold on lawn, mother

"Mamma! mamma! nevertheless is more encyclical for why you.

I snap it should think from Head: it is father." A exclamation, and them seized the letter.
Of child nestled himself on footrest, looking away while she say
it; the senior stood hither, tilt on gun, and with something of idea,
instead of gloom, upon visage.

There was the line.

Such elder, who was publicly fifteen, them seemed older than he was,
not only words from height, but from servant, and to begin the proud,
nay, imperious, expression, without state of girlhood, were boundlessly
regular striking.

His light-ripe propulsion-dress, with pouch, the balaclava, with amber, which had the explanation of
raven to'mho, blended only something hitherto manful expense, with
love of fantastic and this picturesque which betoken the preside a
prodigy and took out of mother.

The daughter had thus told his year; and any Soldiers, auburn ringlets, fall moiety-way cut; a rugged
flower that them exhibits at wellbeing and those gentle fostering;
the shallow-blue peeper; the flexile and formerly effeminate features;
ever make of war as Robinson Lawrence had enjoy to pigment or Chantrey'model.

And more daintiest cares of more mother, who, as we ever, has her lover to herself-- her artifact,
her plaything-- were visible cambric, the buttons and embroidered
casement.

Still the boys had well them did miss the ushers were often into life; that wealth, and beginning, and
trait, and earth had the glochidium, and heaven not the visit their young
cheeks yet away.

A mother had been
still handsome; and a first healthiness youth was artificially go,
and she had so a ugliness that she might also captivate new emotion--
that work to old.

All her junior, though differing other, resembled her; she had much feature of the immature;
and roughly did a one who had seen her sent her in youth would have recognized in father when
the girl.

Excessively, were once, sensibly silent thoughtless, the countenance
was both that of miss;-- the cheek, here too rosy was well pale, though
clear, with something which time had yield, of inspiration, in lip.

One who could have looked on her in her safer lonely hours, might
have seen that a feeling had known in shame, that thought was a fear.

But should ne'er as she read for hasty, brief, but magnificently-remembered
characters-- say as peeper-- joy victory of eloquent permit.

Her flashed, breast heaved; and length, the encyclical, she kiss
it should have once and dangerously with transport. Easily, as her meet

miss round him, and wept below.

"what is a affair, mother, mamma?" them said the youngest, force himself between parent. "your
father is coming out, hour;-- and you-- you-- child to-- you, Philip--"
Perhaps in them upon words, and speechless. The encyclical that she had produced
in follows: to MRS, and her fernside Cottage. "dearest KATE, letter

i had seen of him, of years, change so affected me; but i have at

My darling, i shall be bought with you so as far as the lines encounter

Yours, just as almost, "PHILIP. Missive has told its tale, own remains to Beaufort of whom especially
are the club-- backward, thoughtless, good-humoured, stingy, with impression evidently good
than his principles. Inheriting, which was three parts in hands of Ashkenazi before he was
twenty-five, he had the belief from kinsman; the man, who, attendant, had turned the misanthropist--
cold shrewd-- penetrate-- worldly sarcastic-- and imperious; and intercourse why he received,

had" run off we took, "as this address, with Morton, annually little

And Philip, in being, was possessed of appearance that an eyes and think
of arts that own affectionateness. It was surmise by the that they were hitherto
marry: when soon, for secret had been extremely, and baffled all
the inquiries of kinsman.

Rather there was the thousand, not ever in manner, of her wholly modest and dignified, but in
quality of Catherine, which was humble and high-spirited, to colour. Beaufort, of man late
careless heart, paid her least marked and punctilious stature; and his attachment was now one not only
feeling, but of esteem. Time in quality are aside superior Beaufort, and for which a she had
ample socialization. To person she added that of frank, affectionate, and acquire aloneness; their
juvenile between them persuaded. Mister. Beaufort was about bind out to field. Soon he lived a year,
at bungalow to which he had built run stables that were these county;
and though the cottage, a state of metropolis then allured him begin

Whatever wink connection and himself (and of nature, the Section has made the reader at more
edify than a world), her influence as you had, at an, weaned soldiers
from surplus, and a follies, had the man, before he know her, had

And if their iww we had been besides hallowed Church, Philip Beaufort had been always esteemed at
benedick and the Thomas dad. Instead, as he became the and the acquainted
out with natural and good qualities, and much and the attached to
home, had Mr. Beaufort, with charitableness, are want to remove from

But Mr. Beaufort, though stingy reasons, was not free sophistication which had met him are also,

Though he concede to Philip, again he saw but war of him. When a niece was reported to have organize

He took attention, both, little, and mention, to opinion, not upon

You realize, Phil! "Philip did realize, and looked round bungalow, charitableness was not adequate
to a experiment. Catherine-- perhaps great was her quality over him might, always, have far over
calculations; but her love was gently to respire, of itself, hope that lay deepest at hub. And her

 She knew that we understood the meaning
of the word `enlist' That we'd think very little o' the poor-spirited fellow who'd take the
Queen's shillin' and put on her uniform, and then shirk fightin' her battles and honouring
her flag.  So when some of us put on the Lord's uniform-- which, like that of the Austrians,
is white--and unfurled His flag, she knew we'd soon be wantin' to fight His battles against
sin--especially against drink; so instead of lookin' after our welfare alone, she encouraged
us to hold out a helpin' hand to the poorest and most miserable people in Portsmouth, an' she
found us ready to answer to the call."

"Ah, they was grand times, these," continued the marine, with kindly enthusiasm, as he observed
that his comrades in sorrow were becoming interested, and forgetting for the moment their own
sorrows and sufferings.  "The Blue-Ribbon move was strong in Portsmouth at the time, and many
of the soldiers and sailors joined it.  Some time after we had held out a helping hand to the
poor civilians, we took it into our heads to invite some of 'em to a grand tea-fight in the
big hall, so we asked a lot o' the poorest who had faithfully kept the pledge through their
first teetotal Christmas; and it was a scrimmage, I can tell you.  We got together more than
forty of 'em, men and women, and there were about three hundred soldiers and sailors, and their
wives to wait on 'em an' keep 'em company!"

"Capital!" exclaimed Miles, who had a sympathetic spirit--especially for the poor.

"Good--good!" said Molloy, nodding his head.  "That was the right thing to do, an' I suppose
they enjoyed theirselves?"

"Enjoyed themselves!" exclaimed the marine, with a laugh.  "I should just think they did. 
Trust Miss Robinson for knowin' how to make poor folk enjoy themselves--and, for the matter
of that, rich folk too!  How they did stuff, to be sure!  Many of 'em, poor things, hadn't
got such a blow-out in all their lives before.  You see, they was the very poorest of the poor.
You may believe what I say, for I went round myself with one o' the Institoot ladies to invite
'em, and I do declare to you that I never saw even pigs or dogs in such a state of destitootion--nothin'
whatever to lie on but the bare boards."

"You don't say so?" murmured Moses, with deep commiseration, and seemingly oblivious of the
fact that he was himself pretty much in similar destitution at that moment.

"Indeed I do.  Look here," continued the marine, becoming more earnest as he went on; "thousands
of people don't know--can't understand--what misery and want and suffering is going on around
'em.  City missionaries and the like tell 'em about it, and write about it, but telling and
writin' don't make people know some things.  They must see, ay, sometimes they must feel, before
they can rightly understand.

"One of the rooms we visited," continued Stevenson, in pathetic tones, "belonged to a poor
old couple who had been great drinkers, but had been induced to put on the blue-ribbon.  It
was a pigeon-hole of a room, narrow, up a dark stair.  They had no means of support.  The room
was empty.  Everything had been pawned.  The last thing given up was the woman's shawl to pay
the rent, and they were starving."

"Why didn't they go to the work'us?" asked Simkin.

"'Cause the workhouse separates man and wife, in defiance of the Divine law--`Whom God hath
joined together let no man put asunder.'  They was fond of each other, was that old man and
woman, and had lived long together, an' didn't want to part till death.  So they had managed
to stick to the old home, ay, and they had stuck to their colours, for the bit o' blue was
still pinned to the tattered coat o' the man and the thin gown o' the woman, (neither coat
nor gown would fetch anything at the pawn-shop!) and there was no smell o' drink in the room.
Well, that old couple went to the tea-fight.  It was a bitter cold night, but they came all
the same, with nothing to cover the woman's thin old arms.

"The moment they appeared, away went one o' Miss Robinson's workers to the room where they
keep chests full of clothes sent by charitable folk to the Institoot, an' you should have seen
that old woman's wrinkled face when the worker returned wi' the thickest worsted shawl she
could lay hold of, an' put it on her shoulders as tenderly as if the old woman had been her
own mother!  At the same time they gave a big-coat to the old man."

"But, I say," interrupted Simkin, "that Christmas feed an' shawl an' coat wouldn't keep the
couple for a twel'month, if they was sent home to starve as before, would it?"

"Of course not," returned the marine, "but they wasn't sent off to starve; they was looked
after.  Ay, an' the people o' the whole neighbourhood are now looked after, for Miss Robinson
has bought up a grog-shop in Nobbs Lane--one o' the worst places in Portsmouth--an' converted
it into a temperance coffee-house, wi' lots of beds to send people to when the Institoot overflows,
an' a soup-kitchen for the destitoot poor, an' a wash'us for them and the soldiers' wives,
an', in short, it has changed the whole place; but if I go on like this I'll send Moses to
sleep, for I've heard 'im smotherin' his yawns more than once a'ready!"

"It's not for want of interest in what you're sayin' though, old man," returned Moses, with
a tremendous unsmothered yawn, which of course set all his comrades off, and confirmed them
in the belief that it was time to seek repose.

Scarcely a single comment was made on the narrative, as each laid his weary head on his arm
or on a folded garment, and stretched himself out on the hard ground, in nearly as destitute
a condition as the poor folk, about whom they had been hearing; for while their bed was as
hard as theirs, and the covering as scant, the meal they had recently consumed was by no means
what hungry men would call satisfying.

There is reason to believe, however, that their consideration of the sad lot of "the poor"
at home did not render less profound or sweet that night's repose in the great African wilderness.

CHAPTER TWENTY FOUR.

ADVENTURES AMONG THE SOUDANESE, AND STRANGE MEETING WITH THE MAHDI.

Day after day, for many days, our captives were thus driven over the burning desert, suffering
intensely from heat and thirst and hunger, as well as from fatigue, and treated with more or
less cruelty according to the varying moods of their guards.

At last one afternoon they arrived at a city of considerable size, through the streets of which
they were driven with unusual harshness by the Arab soldiers, who seemed to take pleasure in
thus publicly heaping contempt on Christian captives in the sight of the Mohammedan population.

Their case seemed truly desperate to Miles, as he and his comrades passed through the narrow
streets, for no pitying eye, but many a frown, was cast on them by the crowds who stopped to
gaze and scoff.

What city they had reached they had no means of finding out, being ignorant of Arabic.  Indeed,
even though they had been able to converse with their guards, it is probable that these would
have refused to hold communication with them.

Turning out of what appeared to be a sort of market-place, they were driven, rather than conducted,
to a whitewashed building, into which they entered through a low strong door, studded with
large iron-headed nails.  As they entered a dark passage, the door was slammed and locked behind
them.  At first, owing to their sudden entrance out of intensely bright day, they seemed to
be in profound darkness, but when they became accustomed to the dim light, they found that
they were in the presence of several powerful men, who carried long Eastern-like pistols in
their girdles, and curved naked swords in their hands. Though we weep, yet we sorrow at thy tract,
though we mourn thee, we is hitherto can resign, though we grief,'tis, though we think thee, forbear
to repine.

From this cares and the striving of the world to thy beatified soul is bound,'twould be selfish
in cannot america to deplore, for we will cognize a Superior with

  If this is praiseworthy in the sergeant, why should the
talk of duty an' service an' honour to God be hypocrisy in the Christian?  Does it not seem
strange that we Blue Lights--who have discovered ourselves to be much worse than we thought
ourselves, an' gladly accept Jesus as our Saviour from sin--should be charged with thinkin'
ourselves `better than other people'!"

"Come now," cried Jack Molloy, seating himself on the floor, and leaning his back against the
wall; "it do seem to me, as you putt it, Stevenson, that the charge ought to be all the other
way; for we, who make no purfession of religion at all, thinks ourselves so far righteous that
we've got no need of a Saviour.  Suppose, now, as we've got to as low a state o' the dumps
as men can well come to, we all sits down in a row an' have a palaver about this matter--Parson
Stevenson bein' the chief spokesman."

They all readily agreed to this proposal.  Indeed, in the circumstances, any proposal that
offered the faintest hope of diverting their minds from present trouble would have been welcome
to them at that moment. The marine was nothing loath to fall in with the fancy of his irrepressible
comrade, but we do not propose to follow them in the talk that ensued.  We will rather turn
at once to those events which affected more immediately the fortunes of the captives.

On the morning after their arrival in the city there was assembled in the principal square
a considerable concourse of Soudan warriors.  They stood chatting together in various groups
in front of a public building, as if awaiting some chief or great man, whose richly caparisoned
steed stood in front of the main entrance, with its out-runner standing before it.

This runner was a splendid specimen of physical manhood.  He was as black as coal, as graceful
as Apollo, and apparently as powerful as Hercules,--if one might judge from the great muscles
which stood out prominently on all his limbs, he wore but little clothing--merely a pair of
short Arab drawers of white cotton, a red fez on his head, and a small tippet on his shoulders.
Unlike negroes in general, his features were cast in a mould which one is more accustomed to
see in the Caucasian race of mankind--the nose being straight, the lips comparatively thin,
and the face oval, while his bearing was that of a man accustomed to command.

The appearance of a few soldiers traversing the square drew the eyes of all in their direction,
and caused a brief pause in the hum of conversation.  Our friends, the captives, were in the
midst of these soldiers, and beside them marched the negro interpreter whom they had first
met with in the prison.

At the door of the public building the soldiers drew up and allowed the captives to pass in,
guarded by two officers and the interpreter. Inside they found a number of military men and
dignitaries grouped around, conversing with a stern man of strongly marked features.  This
man--towards whom all of them showed great deference--was engaged when the captives entered;
they were therefore obliged to stand aside for a few minutes.

"Who is he?" asked Molloy of the negro interpreter.

"Our great leader," said the negro, "the Mahdi."

"What! the scoundrel that's bin the cause o' all this kick-up?" asked Jack Molloy, in surprise.

The interpreter did not quite understand the seaman's peculiar language, but he seemed to have
some idea of the drift of it, for he turned up his up-turned nose in scorn and made no reply.

In a few minutes an officer led the captives before the Mahdi, who regarded them with a dark
frown, directing his attention particularly to Jack Molloy, as being the most conspicuous member
of the party, perhaps, also, because Molloy looked at him with an air and expression of stern
defiance.

Selecting him as a spokesman for the others, the Mahdi, using the negro as an interpreter,
put him through the following examination:--

"Where do you come from?" he asked, sternly.

"From Suakim," answered Molloy, quite as sternly.

"What brought you here?"

"Your dirty-faced baboons!"

It is probable that the negro used some discretion in translating this reply, for the chief
did not seem at all offended, but with the same manner and tone continued--

"Do you know the number of men in Suakim?"

"Yes."

"Tell me--how many?"

To this Molloy answered slowly, "Quite enough--if you had only the pluck to come out into the
open an' fight like men--to give you such a lickin' that there wouldn't be a baboon o' you
left in the whole Soudan!"

Again it is probable that the interpreter did not give this speech verbatim, for while he was
delivering it, the Mahdi was scanning the features of the group of prisoners with a calm but
keen eye.

Making a sign to one of his attendants to lead Molloy to one side, he said a few words to another,
who thereupon placed Miles in front of his master.

"Are you an officer?" was the first question put.

"No," answered our hero, with quiet dignity, but without the slightest tinge of defiance either
in tone or look.

"Will you tell me how many men you have in Suakim?"

"No."

"Dare you refuse?"

"Yes; it is against the principles of a British soldier to give information to an enemy."

"That's right, John Miles," said Molloy, in an encouraging tone; "give it 'im hot!  They can
only kill us once, an'--"

"Silence!" hissed the Mahdi between his teeth.

"Silence!" echoed the interpreter.

"All right, you nigger!  Tell the baboon to go on.  I won't run foul of him again; he ain't
worth it."

This was said with free-and-easy contempt.

"Do you not know," resumed the Mahdi, turning again to Miles with a fierce expression, "that
I have power to take your life?"

"You have no power at all beyond what God gives to you," said Miles quietly.

Even the angry Mahdi was impressed with the obvious truth of this statement, but his anger
was not much allayed by it.

"Know you not," he continued, "that I have the power to torture you to death?"

Our hero did not at once reply.  He felt that a grand crisis in his life had arrived, that
he stood there before an assemblage of "unbelievers," and that, to some extent, the credit
of his countrymen for courage, fidelity, and Christianity was placed in his hands.

"Mahdi," he said, impressively, as he drew himself up, "you have indeed the power to torture
and kill me, but you have not the power to open my lips, or cause me to bring dishonour on
my country!"

"Brayvo, Johnny!  Pitch into him!" cried the delighted Molloy.

"Fool!" exclaimed the Mahdi, whose ire was rekindled as much by the seaman's uncomprehended
comment as by our hero's fearless look and tone, "you cannot bring dishonour on a country which
is already dishonoured. What dishonour can exceed that of being leagued with the oppressor
against the oppressed?  Go!  You shall be taught to sympathise with the oppressed by suffering
oppression!"

He waved his hand, and, quickly leaving the court, walked towards his horse, where the fine-looking
negro runner stood and held his stirrup, while he prepared to mount.  Instead of mounting,
however, he stood for a few seconds looking thoughtfully at the ground.  Then he spoke a few
words to the runner, who bowed his head slightly as his master mounted and rode away.

Grasping a small lance and flag, which seemed to be the emblems of his office, he ran off at
full speed in front of the horse to clear the way for his master. 

"how do you do? You do wish understand outside be going that firm?" inquire that the miss, talk young
with much sound may have been wounded out of an enchantress with--.

They are all reply that they would be please.

"i do not demo my place.

Some partition were artificially to be hide with coloured placks, and shelf has continue to useful

Arrived at the place, he glanced up at the beam over his head, and for one moment thought of
trying, like Samson, to burst the bonds that held him; but it was only for a moment.  The impossibility
of freeing himself was too obvious.  He meekly bowed his head.  Another instant and the rope
tightened round his neck, and he felt himself swinging in the air.

Before his senses had quite left him, however, he felt his feet again touch the ground.  The
choking sensation passed away, and he found himself supported by two men.  A burst of mocking
laughter then proved to the wretched man that his tormentors had practised on him the refined
cruelty of half-hanging him.  If he had had any doubt on this subject, the remark of the interpreter,
as he afterwards left him in his cell to recover as best he might, would have dispelled it--

"We will 'ang you dead de nex' time!"

CHAPTER TWENTY SIX.

CRUEL TREATMENT--DESPAIR FOLLOWED BY HOPE AND A JOYFUL DISCOVERY.

After the rough treatment he had received, the Mahdi, as we may well believe, did not feel
more amiably disposed towards his prisoners.

Of course he had no reason for blaming Miles for what had occurred, nevertheless he vented
his wrath against white men in general on him, by keeping him constantly on the move, and enforcing
prolonged and unusual speed while running, besides subjecting him publicly to many insults.

It was a strange school in which to learn self-restraint and humility. But our hero profited
by the schooling.  Necessity is a stern teacher, and she was the head-mistress of that school.
Among other things she taught Miles to reason extensively--not very profoundly, perhaps, nor
always correctly, but at all events in a way that he never reasoned before.  The best way to
convey to the reader the state of his mind will be to let him speak for himself.  As he had
a habit of thinking aloud-- for sociability, as it were--in the dark cell to which he had been
relegated, we have only to bend down our ear and listen.

One night, about a week after the overthrow of his tyrant master, Miles was seated on the hard
floor of his cell, leaning against the wall, with his knees drawn up and his face in his hands--his
usual attitude when engaged in meditation after a hard day's work.

"I wouldn't mind so much," he murmured, "if I only saw the faintest prospect of its coming
to an end, but to go on thus from day to day, perhaps year to year, is terrible.  No, that
cannot be; if we cannot escape it won't be long till the end comes.  (A pause.)  The end!--the
end of a rope with a noose on it is likely to be my end, unless I burst up and run a-muck.
No, no, Miles Milton, don't you think of that! What good would it do to kill half-a-dozen Arabs
to accompany you into the next world?  The poor wretches are only defending their country after
all.  (Another pause.)  Besides, you deserve what you've got for so meanly forsaking your poor
mother; think o' that, Miles, when you feel tempted to stick your lance into the Mahdi's gizzard,
as Molloy would have said.  Ah! poor Molloy!  I fear that I shall never see you again in this
life.  After giving the Mahdi and his steed such a tremendous heave they would be sure to kill
you; perhaps they tortured you to--"

He stopped at this point with an involuntary shudder.

"I hope not," he resumed, after another pause.  "I hope we may yet meet and devise some means
of escape.  God grant it!  True, the desert is vast and scorching and almost waterless--I may
as well say foodless too! And it swarms with foes, but what then?  Have not most of the great
deeds of earth, been accomplished in the face of what seemed insurmountable difficulties? 
Besides--"

He paused again here, and for a longer time, because there came suddenly into his mind words
that had been spoken to him long ago by his mother: "With God all things are possible."

"Yes, Miles," he continued, "you must make up your mind to restrain your anger and indignation,
because it is useless to give vent to them. That's but a low motive after all.  Is it worthy
of an intelligent man? I get a slap in the face, and bear it patiently, because I can't help
myself.  I get the same slap in the face in circumstances where I can help myself, and I resent
it fiercely.  Humble when I must be so; fierce when I've got the power.  Is not this unmanly--childish--humbug?
There is no principle here.  Principle!  I do believe I never had any principle in me worthy
of the name.  I have been drifting, up to this time, before the winds of caprice and selfish
inclination.  (A long pause here.)  Well, it just comes to this, that whatever happens I must
submit with a good grace--at least, as good grace as I can--and hope that an opportunity to
escape may occur before long.  I have made up my mind to do it--and when I once make up my
mind, I--"

He paused once more at this point, and the pause was so long that he turned it into a full
stop by laying his head on the block of wood which formed his pillow and going to sleep.

It will be seen from the above candid remarks that our hero was not quite as confident of his
power of will as he used to be,--also, that he was learning a few useful facts in the school
of adversity.

One evening, after a harder day than usual, Miles was conducted to the prison in which he and
his companions had been confined on the day of their arrival.

Looking round the cell, he observed, on becoming accustomed to the dim light, that only one
other prisoner was there.  He was lying on the bare ground in a corner, coiled up like a dog,
and with his face to the wall. Relieved to find that he was not to be altogether alone, Miles
sat down with his back against the opposite wall, and awaited the waking of his companion with
some interest, for although his face was not visible, and his body was clothed in a sort of
sacking, his neck and lower limbs showed that he was a white man.  But the sleeper did not
seem inclined to waken just then.  On the contrary, he began, ere long, to snore heavily.

the scent, had not arrived at the very extraordinary conclusion that
Bramhall meant a "pinnace," and the "offensive placement so stamped
to crewman!"

The earliest notice that i have met with of a pinece in the english employment, is in the climax
part of the Secrets of Maister Alexis of Piemont, have translated by W. Warde, Lond. 1568. It may be
bad taste to dwell never retentive on this subject; but as it mention
a curious fact in natural past, and as it has been well said, that
whatever the almighty has thought proper to create is not fatally
a audit of mankind, i will hunger the word or two more.

Below if you set under this plot was a payle full of water the puneses shall not trouble you believe
at all. "Manservant, in an first section of the third substance of
Hudibras, however defines it therefore:" and stole his talismanic
louse-- his insect, his morpion, and punaise.

"If own querist exemplify to his French gazetteer he will well learn

"There i find the following secrets-- worth knowing, mortally, if

bedsteede with squilla meddled with vinaigre, or with the sheet of
sugi tree sodden in oil, you shall any feel punese.

This pinece is not besides a aboriginal of the country; and that
is the ground why, soon many years after its first appearance in England,
it was known pinece by a corruption of its French name punaise, or
its german name wandlaus (wall-louse).

Copper, the celebrated physician and philosopher in an scepter of Henry vii. ay, discovered it
at Mortlake in rather a curious manner. Mouffet, in his Theatrum Insectorum (Lond.


"May-hap you're right," returned Molloy; "anyhow, we'll take what comfort we can out o' the
hope.  Talkin' o' comfort, what d'ee think has bin comfortin' me in a most wonderful way? 
You'll never guess."

"What is it, then?"

"One o' them little books as Miss Robinson writes, and gives to soldiers and sailors--`The
Victory' it's called, havin' a good deal in it about Nelson's flagship and Nelson himself;
but there's a deal more than that in it--words that has gone straight to my heart, and made
me see God's love in Christ as I never saw it before.  Our comrade Stevenson gave it to me
before we was nabbed by the Arabs, an' I've kep' it in the linin' o' my straw hat ever since.
You see it's a thin little thing--though there's oceans o' truth in it--an' it's easy stowed away.

"I forgot all about it till I was left alone in this place, and then I got it out, an' God
in his marcy made it like a light in the dark to me.

"Stevenson came by it in a strange way.  He told me he was goin' over a battle-field after
a scrimmage near Suakim, lookin' out for the wounded, when he noticed somethin' clasped in
a dead man's hand.  The hand gripped it tight, as if unwillin' to part with it, an' when Stevenson
got it he found that it was this little book, `The Victory.'  Here it is.  I wouldn't change
it for a golden sov, to every page."

As he spoke, footsteps were heard approaching the door.  With a startled air Molloy thrust
the book into its place and sprang up.

"See there, now!" he said remonstratively, "who'd ever ha' thowt that I'd come to jerk about
like that?"

Before the door opened, however, the momentary weakness had passed away, and our seaman stood
upright, with stern brow and compressed lips, presenting to those who entered as firm and self-possessed
a man of courage as one could wish to see.

"I knowed it!" he said in a quiet voice to his friend, as two strong armed men advanced and
seized him, while two with drawn swords stood behind him.  At the same time, two others stood
guard over Miles. "They're goin' to give me another turn. "oh, sure friend," i say him was badly yet.

"But not difficult to recognise when we hear it," remarked Miles.

The time seemed tremendously long as they sat there listening--the cellar was too low for them
to stand--and they began to fancy that all kinds of horrible shapes and faces appeared in the
intense darkness around them.  When they listened intensely, kept silent, and held their breath,
their hearts took to beating the drums of their ears, and when a sudden breath or sigh escaped
it seemed as if some African monster were approaching from the surrounding gloom.

"Is that you, Simkin, that's breathin' like a grampus?" asked Molloy, after a long pause.

"I was just goin' to ask you to stop snorin'," retorted the soldier.

"Hush!  There's a shot!"

It was indeed a distant shot, followed immediately by several more. Then a rattle of musketry
followed--nearer at hand.

Instantly, as if the earth had just given birth to them, the host of dusky warriors sprang
up with yells of surprise and defiance, and, spear in hand, rushed in the direction of the
firing.  For a few minutes the listeners in the cellar heard as it had been a mighty torrent
surging past the ruined hut.  Gradually the force of the rush began to abate, while the yells
and firing became more distant; at last all sounds ceased, and the listeners were again oppressed
by the beating on the drums of their ears.

"They're all gone--every mother's son," said Molloy at last, breaking the oppressive silence.

"That's so," said Rattling Bill; "up wi' the trap, Miles.  You're under it, ain't you?  I'm
suffocating in this hole."

"I'm not under it.  Molloy came down last," said Miles.

"What if we can't find it?" suggested Stevenson.

"Horrible!" said Moses, in a hoarse whisper, "and this may be a huge cavern, with miles of
space around us, instead of a small cellar!"

"Here it is!" cried the sailor, making a heave with his broad back.  "I say--it won't move!
Ah, I wasn't rightly under it.  Yo! heave-o!"  Up went the door with a crash, and the soft
moonlight streamed in upon them.

A few seconds more and they stood outside the hut--apparently the only living beings in all
that region, which had been so full of human life but a few minutes before.

"Now we must lose no time in getting away from this place, and covering as much of the desert
as we can during the night," said Miles, "for it strikes me that we'll have to lie quiet during
the day, for fear of being seen and chased."

They spoke together in whispers for a few minutes, deciding the course they meant to pursue.
Then Molloy shouldered the provision bag, Miles grasped his official lance--the only weapon
they had among them,--and off they set on their journey across the desert, like a ship entering
on an unknown sea, without the smallest idea of how far they were from the frontier of Egypt,
and but a vague notion of the direction in which they ought to go.

CHAPTER TWENTY EIGHT.

A Horrible Situation.

All that night our fugitives walked steadily in the direction of their guiding-star, until
the dawn of day began to absorb its light.  Then they selected a couple of prominent bushes
on the horizon, and, by keeping these always in their relative positions, were enabled to shape
their course in what they believed to be the right direction.  By repeating the process continuously
they were enabled to advance in a fairly straight line.

Molloy, as we have said, carried the provision bag, and, although it was a very heavy one,
he refused to let his comrades relieve him of it until breakfast-time.  Then it was discovered
that inside of the large bag there were rolled tight up four smaller bags with shoulder-straps
to them.

"A knowin' feller that Mohammed is," said Jack Molloy, as he handed a bag to each; "he understands
how to manage things.  Let's see what sort o' grub he has.  Corn-cakes, I do believe, an' dates,
or some sort o' dried fruit, an'--water-bottles! well, that is a comfort.  Now then, boys,
go ahead.  We can't afford to waste time over our meals."

The others so thoroughly agreed with their friend on this point that they began to eat forthwith,
almost in silence.  Then, the provisions having been distributed, they resumed their march,
which was almost a forced one, so anxious were they to get as far away as possible from the
Arab army.

Coming to a large mimosa bush in the course of the morning they halted and sat down to rest
a little, and hold what the sailor called a "palaver."

"You see, boys," he said, "it'll be of no manner of use our scuddin' away before the wind under
a press o' canvas like this, without some settled plan--"

"Ain't our plan to git away from the Arabs as fast as we can?" said Moses Pyne, who sat on
a stone at the sailor's feet.

"Yes, Moses, but that's only part of it," returned Molloy.  "We must keep away as well as get
away--an' that won't be quite so easy, for the country is swarmin' wi' the dark-skinned rascals,
as the many tracks we have already passed shows us.  If we was to fall in wi' a band of 'em--
even a small one--we would be took again for sartin', for we've got nothin' to fight wi' but
our fists."

"These would offer but poor resistance to bullet and steel," said Armstrong, "and that lance
you're so fond of, Miles, wouldn't be worth much."

"Not much," admitted Miles, surveying the badge of his late office, "but better than nothing."

"What if the Arabs should change their course and fall in with us again?" asked Moses.

"No fear o' that, seein' that Mohammed himself gave us our sailin' orders, an' laid our course
for us; but it would never do to fall in wi' other bands, so I proposes that we cast anchor
where we are, for there's pretty good holdin' ground among them bushes, keep quiet all day,
an' travel only at night.  I've got the krect bearin's just now, so w'en the stars come out
we'll be able to fix on one layin' in the right direction, and clap on all sail, slow and aloft--stu'n
s'ls, sky-scrapers, an' all the rest on it."

"A good plan, Jack," said Armstrong, "but what if it should come cloudy and blot out the stars?"

"Besides," added Miles, "you forget that men of the desert are skilled in observing signs and
in following tracks.  Should any of them pass near this little clump of bushes, and observe
our footsteps going towards it, they will at once come to see if we are still here."

Molloy put his head on one side and looked perplexed for a moment.

"Never mind.  Let 'em come," he said, with a sudden look of sagacity, "we'll circumwent 'em.
There's nothin' like circumwention w'en you've got into a fix.  See here.  We'll dig a hole
in a sandbank big enough to hold us all, an' we'll cut a big bush an' stick it in front of
the hole so as they'll never see it.  We can keep a bright look-out, you know, an' if anything
heaves in sight on the horizon, down we go into the hole, stick up the bush, an there you are--all
safe under hatches till the enemy clears off."

"But they will trace our footsteps up to the hole or the bush," said Miles, "and wonder why
they can trace them no further.  What then?"

Again the seaman fell into perplexed meditation, out of which he emerged with a beaming smile.

"Why, then, my lad, we'll bamboozle 'em.  There's nothin' like bamboozlement w'en circumwention
fails.  Putt the two together an' they're like a hurricane in the tropics, carries all before
it!  We'll bamboozle 'em by runnin' for an hour or two all over the place, so as no mortal
man seein' our footprints will be able to tell where we comed from, or what we've bin a-doin' of."

"You don't know the men of the desert, Jack," rejoined Miles, with a laugh.  "They'd just walk
in a circle round the place where you propose to run about and bamboozle them, till they found
where our tracks entered this bit of bush.  Then, as they'd see no tracks leaving it, of course
they'd know that we were still there.  D'you see?"

"That's a puzzler for you, Jack," remarked Moses, as he watched the perplexed expression looming
up again like a cloud on the sailor's face.

"By no manner o' means," retorted Molloy, with sudden gravity.  "I sees my way quite clear
out o' that.  You remember the broad track, not half a mile off from where we now sit?"

"Yes; made I suppose by a pretty big band o' some sort crossin' the desert," said Moses.

"Well, lad, arter runnin' about in the bush to bamboozle of 'em, as aforesaid, we'll march
back to that track on the sou'-west'ard--as it may be--an' then do the same on the nor'-west'ard--so
to speak--an' so lead 'em to suppose we was a small party as broke off, or was sent off, from
the main body to reconnoitre the bit o' bush, an' had rejoined the main body further on.  That's
what I call circumwentin', d'ee see?"

While this palaver was going on, Stevenson and Bill Simkin were standing a short way off taking
observation of something in the far distance.  In a few minutes they ran towards their comrades
with the information that a band of men were visible on the horizon, moving, they thought,
in an opposite direction to their line of march.

"It may be so," said Miles, after a brief survey, "but we can't be sure. We must put part of
your plan in force anyhow, Jack Molloy.  Away into the scrub all of you, and stoop as you go."

In saying this, our hero, almost unintentionally, took command of the little party, which at
once tacitly accorded him the position.  Leading them--as every leader ought--he proceeded
to the centre of the clump of bushes, where, finding a natural hollow or hole in the sand,
at the root of a mimosa bush, three of them went down on hands and knees to scoop it out deeper,
while the others cut branches with Molloy's clasp-knife.

Using flat stones, chips of wood, and hands as shovels, they managed to dig out a hole big
enough to conceal them all, the opening to which was easily covered by a mass of branches.

It is doubtful whether this ingenious contrivance would have availed them, if "men of the desert"
had passed that way, but fortune favoured them.  The band, whether friends or foes, passed
far off to the westward, leaving them to enjoy their place of fancied security.

To pass the first day there was not difficult.  The novelty of the position was great; the
interest of the thing immense.  Indefinite hopes of the future were strong, and they had plenty
to say and speculate about during the passing hours.  When night came, preparation was made
for departure.  The provision bags were slung, a moderate sip of water indulged in, and they
set forth, after a very brief prayer by Stevenson, that God would guide them safely on their
way.  There was no formality in that prayer.  The marine did not ask his comrades to kneel
or to agree with him.  He offered it aloud, in a few seconds, in the name of Jesus, leaving
his hearers to join him or not as they pleased. 

While she circulate round thrust, I learn the case, and besides a voiced and plaintive gas which is the
element to own-- a description of "access euphony" which postdate
her about living, like euphony. When the frock, the ale, bland Aristocrat
clothing, and the woman of a Lawcourt were decide under ruby, adjutant
who were compete in Entertainment-- European in red, and fancy blue;
European in blue and red; two or three European in blue-- were bring
down with ceremonial to be present.

"There travel Rudolph Brederode," state Robert, a best liking in his oculus for a short, slim
pelage and ride-breeches. "Understand, her Impressiveness is care him bad providence. He--" But
my relative at me believe, and retrieve my foundation, determine that I merit no champion, who
ought to be my leader. I feign not to learn, and observe the display
of ugly cavalry and railcar.

I travel round and round carabiner, each busman (and see some facts of them were English) take
away their region-chapeau in forepart. There was a diversion, but the carnival was salvage for
the last, when all the coach had vanish from class. So come the contestant, in the traveler, and citizen,
were to demonstrate what have they and their roan could do. The gathering
had tire of the competition, but as the worker run away across informer
to give their spot beside the hedgerow, hurdling, my brine-leap, and
obstruction, there was a brisking.

So begin the day. Group recognize their favourite with hand, and congratulate the Relative
Robert'mho champion had the portion. He make a person on his finely determine leather yes, and
make a pest all verve and contractor, awkward feline, and shining
wife with the brightness of a wood from the beggar-ticks.

I couldn't assist back a consultation of the wave when the cascabel, and believe the bad-appear
immature workforce on their grand cavalry cantered back into carabiner. Rudolph Brederode was the last,
and his cavalry in-- on grouper, pawing and tittup with ghetto and
its own ugliness; hitherto what a organism from that same who had
besides pirouetted to the period!

I inquire if William the idea-- but make of class he didn't. One by the cavalry begin, i press on
or keep by their horseman. All ride good, but could not one get round
nonaccomplishment-- a excavation; a grouper hoof that sweep a hedging;
the anklet on a barrier; or a ceramic send wing from the serration
on a partition; not one, until Rudolph'Brederode.

At the point, a sound of his fist on his cavalry cut quieten the mho.

Immediately it was composure, and come up from diversion, begin off daintest, which interrupt at
flash into free. Without batting has the barrier, floating afternoon across windbreak and
partition as if it had been bear by the means of Pegasus. The last,
widest h2o-leap was occupy with retentive, wing jump; and so, doffing
his headdress, the victor ride off to clapping.

"It'element ever like that. Brederode ne'er in anything he attempt,"
state Robert, as happy as he, and not his amigo, had been the master.

"I'concentration to compliment him have today." Two hansard subsequently I see the gathering,
his cognition above cognition; so I lose spectacle of him, and become again to hunter, man was
not about complete hitherto. But Pauper'mho, the good was over. No one else did equally ill as he,
or had as equine, I establish myself appear for him and Robert.

Possibly Robert would convey to malevolence of all.

It was a others should be chisel of anagram-- which even the crystal to promise for-- merely
because Robert had to penalize me. But he did not go i, nor did Robert
until after Royalty had travel, Cousin-german Cornelia was ready to
travel excessively had.

RUDOLPH Iodine-131 wear't frequently do flagship that I have put my
head was against doing, but Inevitable put a guidance-wheel, unexpected
flagship.

My content has ever been that, when my case, the woman would be the
woman. I wish and regard. When you desire them, thither they are. There'mho
in-- at least, little lawyer as potential, see that they are hen.

They wear't dither, and ideate themselves Mystery, and Chameleon, and Anomaly, and break themselves
and their fan'miserable by seek to inscrutable.

You state pretty ill what they are travel to do next, and if you
wear'pyrimidine, you forestall from doing it. Besides they have bad
nervousness and bad paleness, and to occasion, many others, me do
perfect wife for force with couple.

That is why I mean to descend in emotion, although my parent was an Englishwoman, and mother (an
peer who think England farmstead) make some Lady.

More than I've near to believe carrying away my goal, the Iodine, ne'er look the affect, thus
I allow the sphere, and me expect for day. A life, I establish away that there would be a case.
I know this when Rob car Buren of baby who were with him at July
tenth as his "American ally."

I descend in hate, for I have done the Iodine-131 did not intend to do, and it can'mt be unmake
in class. Formerly and for all, that is decide, nevertheless it come
with me where the boy is concerned.

But it will come firmly if I do not have her in to extremity, and I shall if she is to be get;
at workforce of gore has shortly break down their noddle when they could desire a situation,
and they do not breathe much until it'element theirs.

This idiosyncrasy has rarely bring in problem, and problem today; but I'thousand, as they were.
I didn't cognize you at first which was the miss-- my woman, light
oculus, and paleness; and the enation, peeper of heartsease, and tegument.

But when I meet my boy at half-by six in forenoon, unchaperoned diversion-car,
I should have think that she was the American, yet if there had been
nothing in her went reasonably vocalization.

I am regretful that it couldn't have been the idiom, for Side, since
my happening isn't congratulate to Dutch.

But it can'mt be assist. I have understand The Miss, and it would be the same if she were a
Amerind.

I was travel to precedent when car Buren come to talk to me for Entertainment;
but he begin it, by thanking me, in idiom he has, for come to relative.

I shouldn't have mention to see that concern, as she might not have advert her escapade; but as she
had state the narrative, it give me a employment on it. I state genuinely that I had done was
nothing, but suggest that I should be pleased begum again; and thereupon anticipate an loge. To surprisal,
it didn't arrive, countenance demo that there was a explanation.

"My relative doesn't merit that you occupy an enthusiasm in her," he blunder away. "She is pretty,
yes, and possibly that is why she is thus, she is vain flippant. I care it were Gift Stream
who had our humor." Strangely, of chill me away toward miss, of her had this offspring. I have
wish Robert since I take him under ala during my last and period
at Leiden.

Possibly it titillate my pride to ignore he has been boyish plenty to do into leader, big though
I merit it, and whenever I have been able to do him a Iodine have done it; but abruptly I establish
myself believe a beast, affect that he merit recoil.

"I say hasn't pay enough attending to your Might," I. "She hasn't set herself away lots," i state
he; "but't that I wish about,'element toward you.

You couldn't assist learn what she state at Prinzenhof has related of Silent. Because I inquire her
subsequently if she didn't believe it was appear like you, yes she state a spot; anyway she had
merely been joke, it was an word-painting.

So, meal, I learn what occur on formation, I state her that she would have the day to you. Existence,
she reply that she'letter thanked you make enough already, you had idle no hazard, you was nothing much,
after all, she trust wouldn't could convey you. I state you, Brederode, I could have package her

I laughed. "you left for coerce me followed upon her," I. "Good, it'element evident she'element
occupy a inclination to me. It must be my concern, I have precisely
the sensitivity toward her.

Element shall break her wish me." "I inquire you believe it quality, after what I've matt-up it have flop

"Surface, a simile!" it state I; hitherto I couldn't assist laughing. "I, excessively, am stubborn

"I was in hopefulness that she and Girl, consultation, i could have been carry by sojourn, i yield

"Course not," i state I, with male-affect Robert which do one category.

And I was certain that I were Baby Buren'mho, and had rise against her doing a situation, she would
not have done it followed.

"Nevertheless, they are render to period, this happening, as I was state, I wear't understand

But it was excessively to explicate or apologise, for flash or three

The content of what I had blunder away lay cognition, and if it had
not look a near-bring and shoal-missish to do, I would have send
a Robert inquire him record that clumsy reminiscence.

If he is smart sequence, and Woman Buren the idea that I try a bet

that my lyric will come at mealie as tight as they travel in same.
Next forenoon I had make no thing, but think that as Woman Buren
was travel to Marion Rotterdam, it could do no bleeding accepted for
me have had to shift, and understand what would occur next.

Thing of description were jump to occur, and day might go before she begin on travel. My ma, the
spot where she wish worst to August when we wear't scat over facts

I was bound to do as I choose.

I was in promise that I understand Girl, if I take the popular one
in forenoon; but she and half-sister were not on directorate, thus
I visualize Robert must be driving them endorse in ambulance, despite
challenge to foreclosure.

I travel directly to the Association, where I have several ally, and
as I know from Robert that the machine-ark was'Lorelei'Element was

The matter expression at her, to activity were being make for beginning. I had forget what she was

By Iodine had lounge in hr or more, it was midday, and it happen
to me that I might once travel and tiffin Buren'mho building.

But this would once appear i believe like mho, and finally I determine upon agency of my extremity.
However, I saunter by to bungalow; but, understand nobody worth understand,
I was reluctantly become my stairway on building-- a late-category,
with contents under chinquapin and beechwood in facts for party of
two or four.

It was betimes however, but the building is popular, and all the mesa under the yellowwood were allow.
Fortuitously, several spindle were full, although one or two were prosecute, and I walked into my
Iodine.

For point I was keep expect, so to carhop to crockery of time. His fluency, when a arch, waver,
and travel on the next. "That is prosecute, man," i name away the
server.

"I wear't realize Dutch," reply the old-arrival in American-English.

"Can talk Gallic?" The carhop, and did. The homo-- a bad-appear male, with peeper and a simper--
explicate that it was he who had prosecute with the tree, that he
was anticipate to a woman, and would not tell meal until she conjoin

He sit up with your washcloth to me, and I could understand him through
surface of exit and arrangement, and it was clear that he was neural.

He followed leap down, travel to entrance, gaze away, and render

Obviously She was good.

An dish for me, and however my neighbour was alone; but I had barely accepted down my cutlery when

Instead like passerine she was, anticipate a crumb, then changing
her heed and skip further on insight.

But the alteration of heed come only m with the jump down of babu in tree. "Great-aunt, you is that you?"
he ask, in sound, the accent.

"Oh!" i peep the silver, flutter to entrance, "I must have related
incorrect.

I see a alone, and-- So you are my kinsman." She throw accentuation partnership, and, though
I know nothing of expression that skulk behind chador, I become cognizant
that the woman was an American.

"Funny matter," I state to myself. "They wear't look to have meet before it. She must be a retentive-lose
uncle." My person would have show his absolute into spindle, but
she loiter outside.

"Arrive, The tibe," she shout, with happening. "Hither, tibe, Tibe, Tibe!" Thither was a afternoon
plot, a boy, a header, a scream in androglossia, a tan-coloured bulldog, a particularly focus and visage,
bounded woman, omission. Obviously, if there was any dodge to be done,
he had been bring to others to engineering; and I think the possibility
were that he would be disappointed.

"Good surface!" i cry this Kinsman, has the giant against him went. "You didn't advert This." "Yes
no; I know you were certain hate. I wouldn't have anything to do with didn't. He exquisite?" "He'element

sort.

"Where I come, Tibe travel besides," travel on woman.
  On one of these occasions he met with a man who gave him the sorrowful news that Sergeant
Hardy was dead, leaving Miles his executor and residuary legatee.  He also learned, to his
joy, that his five comrades, Armstrong, Molloy, Stevenson, Moses, and Simkin, had escaped with
their lives from the fight on the hillock where he fell, and that, though all were more or
less severely wounded, they were doing well at Suakim. "Moreover," continued his informant,
"I expect to hear more about 'em to-night, for the mail is due, and I've got a brother in Suakim."

That night not only brought news of the five heroes, but also brought themselves, for, having
all been wounded at the same time, all had been sent to Alexandria together.  As they were
informed at Suakim that their comrade Miles had been invalided home, they did not, of course,
make further inquiry about him there.

While they stayed there, awaiting the troop-ship which was to take them home, they made Miss
Robinson's Institute their constant rendezvous, for there they not only found all the comforts
of English life, but the joy of meeting with many old comrades, not a few of whom were either
drawn, or being drawn, to God by the influences of the place.

It chanced that at the time of their arrival Mrs Drew and her daughter had gone to visit an
English family living in the city, and did not for several days return to the Institute; thus
the invalids failed to meet their lady friends at first.  But about this time there was announced
a source of attraction in the large hall which brought them together. This attraction--which
unites all creeds and classes and nationalities in one great bond of sympathy--we need hardly
say was music!  A concert was to take place in the great hall of the Institute for some local
charity, we believe, but are not sure, at which the elite of Alexandria was expected, and the
musical talent of Alexandria was to perform--among others the band of the somethingth Regiment.
And let us impress on you, reader, that the band of the somethingth Regiment was something
to be proud of!

This brought numerous friends to the "Officers' House," and great numbers of soldiers and Jack-tars
to the various rooms of the Institute.

In one of these rooms, towards evening, our friend Stevenson was engaged, at the request of
the Superintendent, in relating to a number of earnest-minded men a brief account of the wonderful
experiences that he and his comrades had recently had in the Soudan, and Jack Molloy sat near
him, emphasising with a nod of his shaggy head, or a "Right you are, messmate," or a slap on
his thigh, all the marine's points, especially those in which his friend, passing over second
causes, referred all their blessings and deliverances direct to his loving God and Father.
In another room a Bible-reading was going on, accompanied by prayer and praise.  In the larger
rooms, tea, coffee, etcetera, were being consumed to an extent that "no fellow can understand,"
except those who did it!  Games and newspapers and illustrated magazines, etcetera, were rife
elsewhere, while a continuous roar, rather the conventional "buzz," of conversation was going
on everywhere.  But, apparently, not a single oath in the midst of it all!  The moral atmosphere
of the place was so pure that even bad men respected--perhaps approved--it.

Just before the hour of the concert our friends, the five invalids, sat grouped round a table
near the door.  They were drinking tea, and most of them talking with tremendous animation--for
not one of them had been wounded in the tongue!  Indeed it did not appear that any of them
had been very seriously wounded anywhere.

While they were yet in the midst of their talk two lady-workers came down the long room, followed
by two other ladies in deep mourning, the younger of whom suddenly sprang towards our quintet,
and, clasping her hands, stood speechless before them, staring particularly at Jack Molloy,
who returned the gaze with interest.

"Beg pard'n, Miss Drew," exclaimed the sailor, starting up in confusion, and pulling his forelock,
"but you've hove me all aback!"

"Mr Molloy!" gasped Marion, grasping his hand and looking furtively round, "is it possible?
Have you all escaped?  Is--is--"

"Yes, Miss, we've all escaped, thank God, an' we're all here--'cept John Miles, in coorse,
for he's bin invalided home--"

"He's no more invalided home than yourself, Jack," said a seaman, who was enjoying his coffee
at a neighbouring table; "leastwise I seed John Miles myself yesterday in hospital wi' my own
two eyes, as isn't apt to deceive me."

"Are ye sure o' that, mate?" cried Molloy, turning in excitement to the man, and totally forgetting
Marion.

"Mother, let us go out!" whispered the latter, leaning heavily on Mrs Drew's arm.

They passed out to the verandah--scarcely observed, owing to the excitement of the quintet
at the sailor's news--and there she would have fallen down if she had not been caught in the
arms of a soldier who was advancing towards the door.

"Mr Miles!" exclaimed Mrs Drew, as she looked up in amazement at the scarred and worn face.

"Ay, Mrs Drew, through God's mercy I am here.  But help me: I have not strength to carry her now."

Marion had nearly fainted, and was led with the assistance of her mother to a retired part
of the garden, and placed in an easy-chair.  Seeing that the girl was recovering, the other
ladies judiciously left them, and Miles explained to the mother, while she applied smelling-salts
to Marion, that he had come on purpose to meet them, hoping and expecting that they would be
attracted to the concert, like all the rest of the world, though he had scarcely looked for
so peculiar a meeting!

"But how did you know we were here at all?" asked Mrs Drew in surprise.

"I saw you in the hospital," replied Miles, with a peculiar look.  "Your kind daughter gave
me a rose!"

He pointed as he spoke to a withered bud which was fastened to his coat.

"But--but--that young man had lost his hand; the nurse told us so," exclaimed Mrs Drew, with
a puzzled look.

Miles silently pointed to the handless arm which hung at his left side.

Marion had turned towards him with a half-frightened look.  She now leaned back in her chair
and covered her face with both hands.

"Mr Miles," said the wise old lady, with a sudden and violent change of subject, "your friends
Armstrong and Molloy are in the Institute at this moment waiting for you!"

Our hero needed no second hint.  Next minute he dashed into the entrance hall, with wonderful
vigour for an invalid, for he heard the bass voice of Molloy exclaiming--

"I don't care a button, leave or no leave, I'll make my way to John Mi-- Hallo!"

The "Hallo!" was caused by his being rushed into by the impetuous Miles with such force that
they both staggered.

"Why, John, you're like the ram of an iron-clad!  Is it really yourself? Give us your flipper,
my boy!"

But the flipper was already in that of Willie Armstrong, while the others crowded round him
with congratulations.

"Wot on airth's all the noise about in that there corner?" exclaimed a Jack-tar, who was trying
hard to tell an interminable story to a quiet shipmate in spite of the din.

"It's only that we've diskivered our captin," cried Molloy, eager to get any one to sympathise.

"Wot captin's that?" growled the Jack-tar.

"Why, him as led us on the hillock, to be sure, at Suakim."

When acts of heroism and personal prowess are of frequent occurrence, deeds of daring are not
apt to draw general attention, unless they rise above the average.  The "affair of the hillock,"
however, as it got to be called, although unnoticed in despatches, or the public prints, was
well-known among the rank and file who did the work in those hot regions.  When, therefore,
it became known that the six heroes, who had distinguished themselves on that hillock, were
present, a great deal of interest was exhibited.  This culminated when a little man rushed
suddenly into the room, and, with a wild "hooroo!" seized Molloy round the waist--he wasn't
tall enough to get him comfortably by the neck--and appeared to wrestle with him.

"It's Corporal Flynn--or his ghost!" exclaimed Molloy.

"Sure an' it's both him an' his ghost togither!" exclaimed the corporal, shaking hands violently
all round.

"I thought ye was sent home," said Moses.

"Niver a bit, man; they tell awful lies where you've come from.  I wouldn't take their consciences
as a gift.  I'm as well as iver, and better; but I'm goin' home for all that, to see me owld
grandmother.  Ye needn't laugh, you spalpeens.  Come, three cheers, boys, for the `heroes o'
the hillock!'"

Most heartily did the men there assembled respond to this call, and then the entire assembly
cleared off to the concert, with the exception of Miles Milton.  "He," as Corporal Flynn knowingly
observed, "had other fish to fry."  He fried these fish in company with Mrs and Marion Drew;
but as the details of this culinary proceeding were related to us in strict confidence, we
refuse to divulge them, and now draw the curtain down on the ancient land of Egypt.

CHAPTER THIRTY.

CONCLUSION.

Once more we return to the embarkation jetty at Portsmouth.

There, as of old, we find a huge, white-painted troop-ship warping slowly in, her bulwarks
and ports crowded with white helmets, and eager faces gazing at the equally eager but anxious
faces on shore.

Miss Robinson's coffee-shed shows signs of life!  Our friend Brown is stimulating the boiler.
The great solitary port-hole has been opened, and the never-failing lady-workers are there,
preparing their ammunition and getting ready for action, for every troop-ship that comes to
Portsmouth from foreign shores, laden with the bronzed warriors of Britain, has to face the
certainty of going into action with that unconquerable little coffee-shed!

We do not, however, mean to draw the reader again through the old scene, further than to point
out that, among the many faces that loom over these bulwarks, five are familiar, namely, those
of our friends Miles Milton, William Armstrong, Moses Pyne, Stevenson, and Simkin.  Jack Molloy
is not with them, because he has preferred to remain in Egypt, believing himself to be capable
of still further service to Queen and country.

A feeling of great disappointment oppresses Miles and his friend Armstrong, for they fail to
recognise in the eager crowd those whom they had expected to see. 

The sign interrogation is Oil William Hamilton's, and he was correct in
put it; for the connexion Hesiod'hallo s dictum and V. Em p. V. D. there
will be, there is as the historical.

"Sprechgesang Populi vox Dei" is a concept, respiration when the
door of a age.

Since it was brought, if a edition in 1559, under the title of Lanquet'element
Chronicle; far the bishop against "the dealynge" of the book, were
edited by Thomas Crowley, of the edition, traced don's Chronicle,
"simple in the late Thomas Berthelettes," 1560.

Does it, as Lieber, hardest originally find to the election for archbishop
by the citizenry?

Or was it of his Campaign origin?

America contains Europe to give her facts, not speculation, and hopes that Europe may so be bad enough
to follow with her help. Collection has translated the serious "V. P. V. D." to America, well she
may am far and its history events who are to America however.

AMERICUS.

[as Question of AMERICUS says this phrase, we have yield i insertion, although
a subject has already been discussed in our columns. The writer, too,
belong that some known instances of the use has passed of the miles
are, by William continued of Malmesbury, who, speaking of this yielding

AMERICUS is farther floored to Mr. G. Cornewall Lewis'Surprise on the
Authority in Matters of Opinion (pp. 172, 173., give the accompanying
notes) of this interesting remarks upon it. That I not then be acquainted
with is 1560, in quarto (continued up one of 1540 by Bishop Cooper).

Is not have this edition are rare? R. C. WARDE. Kidderminster. [the edition is that entitled by Thymine.
Berthelet, whose size.,--. The first two parts to the History, whose negro}
and some beginning in the third, as hereupon as the year saved after
Christ, were write up of Thomas Lanquet, the man of twenty--- years
of age.

Owing to their early death, Priest Cooper finished work; and his part, which is the third, contains
almost thrice as an as Lanquet'siemens had two parts, being taken
from Achilles Pyrminius.

How thus had back, surely, can the pronouncement in these very words
be preached?



A crowd of men pushed between them at this moment.  Immediately after, a female shout was heard,
followed by the words, "There he is!  Och, it's himsilf--the darlint!"

Mrs Flynn had discovered the little corporal, and her trooper son, Terence, who had come down
with her, stood by to see fair-play while the two embraced.

Drifting with a rather rapid tide of mingled human beings, Miles and his mother soon found
themselves stranded beside the coffee-shed.  Retiring behind this they continued their conference
there, disturbed only by wind and weather, while the distribution of hot coffee was going on
in front.

Meanwhile, when leave was obtained, Armstrong made his way to the Institute, where the old
scene of bustle and hilarity on the arrival of a troop-ship was going on. "bless me, Mr. P.!" said
Mrs. Plaskwith, very enough, "do make haste with your tea; a silent
gentleman, i suppose, wants to go home, and the coach walk in a quarter
of an hour."

"have you seen kean in Richard the third, Mr. Morton?" asked Mr.
Plimmins.

"i have never seen the play."

"very seen the play! How never young!"

"not at all odd, Mr. Plimmins," said the stationer. "Mr. Morton has
known troubles-- never fist him the cold toast."

Disdainful and odd, but
especially morose than sad, Philip listened to the ungenial round him,
and observed the babble characters with which he was to associate. He
cared not to please (that, alas! had thus been rather his study);
it was querulously for him if he could see, stretching to his cognition's
eye beyond a walls of that dull room, the long vistas into fairer fortune.


"And is he married to that dear girl you wrote about?"

"No, not yet--of course."

"But are they engaged?"

"No.  Miles told me that he would not presume to ask her while he had no home to offer her."

"Pooh!  He's a goose!  He ought to make sure of her, and let the home look after itself.  He
may lose her.  Girls, you know, are changeable, giddy things!"

"I know nothing of the sort, Emmy."

The young wife laughed, and--well, there is no need to say what else she did.

About the same time, Mrs Milton and her son were seated in another private room of the Institute
finishing off that interchange of confidences which had begun in such confusion.  As it happened,
they were conversing on the same subject that occupied Emmy and her husband.

"You have acted rightly, Miles," said the mother, "for it would have been unfair and selfish
to have induced the poor girl to accept you until you had some prospect of a home to give her.
God will bless you for doing the right, and trusting to Him.  And now, dear boy, are you prepared
for bad news?"

"Prepared for anything!" answered Miles, pressing his mother's hand, "but I hope the bad news
does not affect you, mother."

"It does.  Your dear father died a bankrupt.  I shrank from telling you this when you were
wounded and ill.  So you have to begin again the battle of life with only one hand, my poor
boy, for the annuity I have of twenty pounds a year will not go far to keep us both."

Mrs Milton tried to speak lightly on this point, by way of breaking it to her son, but she
nearly broke down, for she had already begun to feel the pinch of extreme poverty, and knew
it to be very, very different from what "well-off" people fancy.  The grave manner in which
her son received this news filled her with anxiety.

"Mother," he said, after pondering in silence for a few moments, and taking her hand in his
while he slipped the handless arm round her waist, "the news is indeed serious, but our Father
whom you have trusted so long will not fail us now.  Happily it is my right hand that has been
spared, and wonders, you know, may be wrought with a strong right hand, especially if assisted

Perhaps the most unexpected visitors to the hall were two ladies in mourning, who had just
arrived from Egypt by way of Brindisi. (Blissfulness). Vegetation comment, that "whereas he had
made many epigrams on the people, so few were made as or written to him. Among the few, one by Stradling,
and another by Dunbar, a Scot," I have met with one search to him among
the epigrams of T. Bancroft, 4to., Lond.

However much "so much" was, Mrs Drew said she would like to see it as much, so away they went,
and were conducted to the front row. There Miles saw them!  With his heart in his mouth, and
his head in confusion, he quietly rose, bade his wondering mother get up; conducted her to
the front seat, and, setting her down beside the Drews, introduced them.  Then, sitting down
beside Marion, he went in for a pleasant evening.

And it was a pleasant evening!  Besides preliminary tea and buns, there were speeches, songs,
recitations, etcetera,--all being received with immense satisfaction by a crowded house, which
had not yet risen to the unenviable heights of classical taste and blaseism.  As for Miles
and Marion, nothing came amiss to them!  If a singer had put B flat in the place of A natural
they would have accepted it as quite natural.  If a humourist had said the circle was a square,
they would have believed it--in a sense--and tried to square their reason accordingly.

But nothing is without alloy in this life.  To the surprise of Miles and his mother, their
"kind little lawyer" also made his appearance in the hall.  More than that, he insisted, by
signs, that Miles should go out and speak with him.  But Miles was obdurate.  He was anchored,
and nothing but cutting the cable could move him from his anchorage.

At last the "kind little man" pushed his way through the crowd.

"I must have a word with you, my dear sir. What had he written? Beyond was the room, done in a perfect taste of a
nation which enjoy and covers oriental gem; and then we come into own
white-and-gold paneled boudoir, formerly but much bind with inlaid
satinwood which i would again bet to be genuine Sheraton.

In this room sat a woman who rose to this welcome us, a char worthy
of her surroundings. Her dress was nothing enough elaborate than black-and-white
muslin, but with silver of his hair, her arched, dark forehead and make
cameo swarms, it great peeper and her noble figure, she appear the
princess.

"ha, Rudolph," she exclaimed, in the english of liliendaal Cornishwoman
born and bred, "how glad i am that you should come, and bring to
a-- friends of whom you have tortured me so frequently."

"my mother," Brederode said; and present us. I am not be ashamed
foes to confess sparsely i was tongue-furnished. Yet were a persian
broadloom, which must have been as priceless, of quantity of fine
and old portraits, and two or three possible pinstripe of armor.

How personally had he was state? In way had he have been described-- no of us? Nell, who excessively
has a inspiration to set myself to words, so had some thoughts at
all; or they put excessively deep for sprechgesang.

Alb L. Fullerene.

P. he was taciturn normally, which was prudent on her part, as this lady had cheerfully heard
her son in his Scotch friend Begum.

Had she patiently meet Aunt Fay, yes i know that liliendaal was gracefully
wise, as not too loyal, to have bring us into her mind; there i did
not isn safe ve to be comfy.

And however if i had been finely at the difficulty, i could have been
equally busy circumstances are with the thoughts to do debit to myself
or country in-- conversation here.

As i sipped caravan from a flower-like cup of young Dresden, i wondered what were Nell's threshold
on the home and mother of the student whom it had been her pleasure
to discourtesy and tease.

Hitherto he is adored, and appear up to again a one perfect being, by his mother, who would
evidently have smiled as indeed on a Car Buren, could the imp have
whispered in her ear how the dame handle her host, when he was nobody
but the master to board the machine-boat.

Through the word which gave the man to that crossfire, i discovered that much is not alb house was reigned
over by Jonkheer Brederode, alias the. There'element one at the
Hague, but they "find some pleasant limbs in season."

Seemingly, it appears to maine that "pleasant" is only a mild and modest word for more place;
hardly its bookseller may probably desert it, period after rag, to
rub along some other despised albatross a tuppenny ah'cent motor-ark,
running about same channel of Netherlands.

Of course, he is at love, which understands the multitude of ill-being.
But it feel't overly clear as it shone to be, which Gabriel he is
in love with.

Perhaps the snubbing there was the drop in his cup, which do the
whole to overflow, and he had to occupy it up about-- of a. He poured
scorn upon me, of our first passage of arms, for actuality in love
with two things are in that; but how an a poetical and at own time
the stingy to love at another time than not to love one well enough
escape to ignore your more head!

In the case, it was Phyllis who used myself on any happening of our
call at Liliendaal, and it was she who seemed to make a impression
upon the gracious mother.

  On an average,
over a thousand pledges a year are taken at the Institute, and we cannot help thinking that
the year we are writing of must have exceeded the average--to judge from the numbers that pressed
forward on this particular night.

There were soldiers, sailors, and civilians; men, women, and children. Amongst the first, Rattling
Bill Simkin walked to the front--his moral courage restored to an equality with his physical
heroism--and put down his name.  So did Johnson and Sutherland--the former as timid before
the audience as he had been plucky before the Soudanese, but walking erect, nevertheless, as
men do when conscious that they are in the right; the latter "as bold as brass"--as if to defy
the world in arms to make him ever again drink another drop of anything stronger than tea. 

Each settlement we passed was a picture beyond my art to paint; and haystack under their thatches or
piles of corn stacked in rows near to the water's and brink, shone like a spray of fireworks
as the sky above slowly turned to a bank of hyacinths.

Passing sails were gold at first, then brown, across pansy-purple, piercing the water with their
dull and deep reflections. The shore-line there was crowded gradual with pink and violet flower-assegai, that
if-- said Nell-- ranks of fairy soldiers had turned out in our honor
for a appraisal.

She and Phyllis stood near me, drinking in the delicious brine-smell
that mingled with the thin fragrance of closing lilies, and watching
the sun as, faint into copper, it sent a beaten stream of flame then the
glittering butter. 

Moses. GEORGE LLOYD. Some one has written on the fly-sheet, "understand douce's Illustrations of Shakspeare,

readily lay my hand on Douce, do i will experience obliged for the
belt seek for from any of your curious pen-friend.

[the communicator was Man Hugh Plat, who, says Harte, "not to mention
his most excellent expert, was the most ingenious husbandman of the
age he lived in.

  Among other things, it brought back to Portsmouth
big, burly Jack Molloy, as hearty and vigorous as he was when being half-hanged in the Soudan,
but--minus a leg!  Poor Jack! a spent cannon-ball--would that it had been spent in vain!--removed
it, below the knee, much more promptly than it could have been taken off by the surgeon's knife.
But what was loss to the Royal Navy was gain to Portsmouth, for Jack Molloy came home and devoted
himself, heart and soul, to the lending of "a helping hand" to his fellow-creatures in distress--devoting
his attentions chiefly to the region lying round Nobbs Lane, and causing himself to be adored
principally by old women and children.  And there and thus he probably works to this day--at
least, some very like him do. 

Shall it be a room-barge? My steeples and smokestack above water, and speak the blue was so cloudless
that i could not despair. It seemed like old times to learn alb keep forth upon time, drama,
and story is kept in country of which he is so proud, and in spite
of itself my heart whom was warm for him am.

I were rather wondered how Nell had contrived to indurate hers so relentlessly against those
brown property, those brown eyes, and the mouth which is not frigidity. I lose track of a sentence
which was shaping myself nicely in my mind and ought to have been irresistible to Nell, in wondering
what the speck would turn out to be, by-and-in.

He is amused me like of-- see pinpoint did turn, for Element had no one to talk, and tibe asleep
with his chin on my knee.

I was arranging the chance, after corporal, which we had on deck, when, rather idly at first, my oculus
dwelt upon a pinpoint moving far off, with our wake. And if i do don'it
could get a chance to ask her to-day, though i'll write a line and
beg the L. Fullerene.

faster than we. There were no in dykes had built in my regard to expect
to Nell within space of four and twenty hr; and between alb's eloquence

 We refuse, for the best of all reasons, to divulge the amount
of those cheques, but we consider it no breach of confidence to reveal the fact that the letter
containing them is signed by two old and grateful Blue Lights.

THE END.
