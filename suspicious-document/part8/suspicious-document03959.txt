It was only during the minute or two that Clara began to think how she should break the tidings
to her friend, or in any way to realize the fact that the "tidings" would require breaking.
She had rushed across the street with the important paper in her hand, proud of the fact that
she had something great to tell. But during that minute or two it did occur to her that a choice
of words was needed for such an occasion. "Oh, Miss Fay," she said, "have you heard?"

"Heard what?" asked Marion.

"I do not know how to tell you, it is so terrible! I have only just seen it in the newspaper,
and have thought it best to run over and let you know."

"Has anything happened to my father?" asked the girl.

"It isn't your father. This is almost more dreadful, because he is so young." Then that bright
pink hue spread itself over Marion's face; but she stood speechless with her features almost
hardened by the resolution which she had already formed within her not to betray the feelings
of her heart before this other girl. The news, let it be what it might, must be of him! There
was no one else "so young," of whom it was probable that this young woman would speak to her
after this fashion. She stood silent, motionless, conveying nothing of her feelings by her
face,--unless one might have read something from the deep flush of her complexion. "I don't
know how to say it," said Clara Demijohn. "There; you had better take the paper and read for
yourself. It's in the last column but one near the bottom. 'Fatal Accident in the Field!' You'll
see it."

Marion took the paper, and read the words through without faltering or moving a limb. Why would
not the cruel young woman go and leave her to her sorrow? Why did she stand there looking at
her, as though desirous to probe to the bottom the sad secret of her bosom? She kept her eyes
still fixed upon the paper, not knowing where else to turn them,--for she would not look into
her tormentor's face for pity. "Ain't it sad?" said Clara Demijohn.

Then there came a deep sigh. "Sad," she said, repeating the word; "sad! Yes, it's sad. I think,
if you don't mind, I'll ask you to leave me now. Oh, yes; there's the newspaper."

"Perhaps you'd like to keep it for your father." Here Marion shook her head. "Then I'll take
it back to aunt. She's hardly looked at it yet. When she came to the paragraph, of course,
she read it out; and I wouldn't let her have any peace till she gave it me to bring over."

"I wish you'd leave me," said Marion Fay.

Then with a look of mingled surprise and anger she left the room, and returned across the street
to No. 10. "She doesn't seem to me to care a straw about it," said the niece to her aunt; "but
she got up just as highty tighty as usual and asked me to go away."

When the Quaker came to the door, and opened it with his latch-key, Marion was in the passage
ready to receive him. Till she had heard the sound of the lock she had not moved from the room,
hardly from the position, in which the other girl had left her. She had sunk into a chair which
had been ready for her, and there she had remained thinking over it. "Father," she said, laying
her hand upon his arm as she went to meet him, and looking up into his face;--"father?"

"My child!"

"Have you heard any tidings in the City?"

"Have you heard any, Marion?"

"Is it true then?" she said, seizing both his arms as though to support her.

"Who knows? Who can say that it be true till further tidings shall come? Come in, Marion. It
is not well that we should discuss it here."

"Is it true? Oh, father;--oh, father; it will kill me."

"Nay, Marion, not that. After all, the lad was little more than a stranger to thee."

"A stranger?"

"How many weeks is it since first thou saw'st him? And how often? But two or three times. I
am sorry for him;--if it be true; if it be true! I liked him well."

"But I have loved him."

"Nay, Marion, nay; thou shouldst moderate thyself."

"I will not moderate myself." Then she disengaged herself from his arm. "I loved him,--with
all my heart, and all my strength; nay, with my whole soul. If it be so as that paper says,
then I must die too. Oh, father, is it true, think you?"

He paused a while before he answered, examining himself what it might be best that he should
say as to her welfare. As for himself, he hardly knew what he believed. These papers were always
in search of paragraphs, and would put in the false and true alike,--the false perhaps the
sooner, so as to please the taste of their readers. But if it were true, then how bad would
it be to give her false hopes! "There need be no ground to despair," he said, "till we shall
hear again in the morning."

"I know he is dead."

"Not so, Marion. Thou canst know nothing. If thou wilt bear thyself like a strong-hearted girl,
as thou art, I will do this for thee. I will go across to the young lord's house at Hendon
at once, and inquire there as to his safety. They will surely know if aught of ill has happened
to their master."

So it was done. The poor old man, after his long day's labour, without waiting for his evening
meal, taking only a crust with him in his pocket, got into a cab on that cold November evening,
and had himself driven by suburban streets and lanes to Hendon Hall. Here the servants were
much surprised and startled by the inquiries made. They had heard nothing. Lord Hampstead and
his sister were expected home on the following day. Dinner was to be prepared for them, and
fires had already been lighted in the rooms. "Dead!" "Killed out hunting!" "Trodden to death
in the field!" Not a word of it had reached Hendon Hall. Nevertheless the housekeeper, when
the paragraph was shown to her, believed every word of it. And the servants believed it. Thus
the poor Quaker returned home with but very little comfort.

Marion's condition during that night was very sad, though she struggled to bear up against
her sorrow in compliance with her father's instructions. There was almost nothing said as she
sat by him while he ate his supper. On the next morning, too, she rose to give him his breakfast,
having fallen asleep through weariness a hundred times during the night, to wake again within
a minute or two to the full sense of her sorrow. "Shall I know soon?" she said as he left the
house.

"Surely some one will know," he said; "and I will send thee word."

But as he left the house the real facts had already been made known at the "Duchess of Edinburgh."
One of the morning papers had a full, circumstantial, and fairly true account of the whole
matter. "It was not his lordship at all," said the good-natured landlady, coming out to him
as he passed the door.

"Not Lord Hampstead?"

"Not at all."

"He was not killed?"

"It wasn't him as was hurt, Mr. Fay. It was another of them young men--one Mr. Walker; only
son of Watson, Walker, and Warren. And whether he be dead or alive nobody knows; but they do
say there wasn't a whole bone left in his body. It's all here, and I was a-going to bring it
you. I suppose Miss Fay did take it badly?"

"I knew the young man," said the Quaker, hurrying back to his own house with the paper,--anxious
if possible not to declare to the neighbourhood that the young lord was in truth a suitor for
his daughter's hand. "And I thank thee, Mrs. Grimley, for thy care. The suddenness of it all
frightened my poor girl."

"That'll comfort her up," said Mrs. Grimley cheerily. "From all we hear, Mr. Fay, she do have
reason to be anxious for this young lord. I hope he'll be spared to her, Mr. Fay, and show
himself a true man."

Then the Quaker returned with his news,--which was accepted by him and by them all as trustworthy.
"Now my girl will be happy again?"

"Yes, father."

"But my child has told the truth to her old father at last."

"Had I told you any untruth?"

"No, indeed, Marion."

"I said that I am not fit to be his wife, and I am not. Nothing is changed in all that. But
when I heard that he was--. But, father, we will not talk of it now. How good you have been
to me, I shall never forget,--and how tender!"

"Who should be soft-hearted if not a father?"

"They are not all like you. But you have been always good and gentle to your girl. How good
and how gentle we cannot always see;--can we? But I have seen it now, father."

As he went into the City, about an hour after his proper time, he allowed his heart to rejoice
at the future prospects of his girl. He did now believe that there would be a marriage between
her and her noble lover. She had declared her love to him,--to him, her father, and after that
she would surely do as they would have her. Something had reached even his ears of the coyness
of girls, and it was not displeasing to him that his girl had not been at once ready to give
herself with her easy promise to her lover. How strong she had looked, even in the midst of
her sufferings, on the previous evening! That she should be weaker this morning, less able
to restrain her tears, more prone to tremble as he spoke to her, was but natural. The shock
of the grief will often come after the sorrow is over. He knew that, and told himself that
there need be nothing,--need not at least be much,--to fear.

But it was not so with Marion as she lay all the morning convulsed almost with the violence
of her emotions. Her own weakness was palpable to herself, as she struggled to regain her breath,
struggled to repress her sobs, struggled to move about the house, and be as might be any other
girl. "Better just lie thee down till thy father return, and leave me to bustle through the
work," said the old Quaker woman who had lived with them through all their troubles. Then Marion
yielded, and laid herself on the bed till the hour had come in which her father might be expected.

CHAPTER XX.

NEVER, NEVER, TO COME AGAIN.

The trouble to Hampstead occasioned by the accident was considerable, as was also for the first
twenty-four hours his anxiety and that of his sister as to the young man's fate. He got back
to Gorse Hall early in the day, as there was no more hunting after the killing of that first
fox. There had been a consultation as to the young man, and it had been held to be best to
have him taken to the inn at which he had been living, as there would be room there for any
of his friends who might come to look after him. But during the whole of that day inquiries
were made at Gorse Hall after Lord Hampstead himself, so general had been the belief that he
was the victim. From all the towns around, from Peterborough, Oundle, Stilton, and Thrapstone,
there came mounted messengers, with expressions of hope and condolence as to the young lord's
broken bones.

And then the condition of their poor neighbour was so critical that they found it to be impossible
to leave Gorse Hall on the next day, as they had intended. He had become intimate with them,
and had breakfasted at Gorse Hall on that very morning. In one way Hampstead felt that he was
responsible, as, had he not been in the way, poor Walker's horse would have been next to the
gate, and would not have attempted the impossible jump. They were compelled to put off the
journey till the Monday. "Will go by the 9.30 train," said Hampstead in his telegram, who,
in spite of poor Walker's mangled body, was still determined to see Marion on that day. On
the Saturday morning it became known to him and his sister that the false report had been in
the London newspapers, and then they had found themselves compelled to send telegrams to every
one who knew them, to the Marquis, and to the lawyer in London, to Mr. Roberts, and to the
housekeeper at Hendon Hall. Telegrams were also sent by Lady Amaldina to Lady Persiflage, and
especially to Lord Llwddythlw. Vivian sent others to the Civil Service generally. Hautboy was
very eager to let everybody know the truth at the Pandemonium. Never before had so many telegrams
been sent from the little office at Gimberley. But there was one for which Hampstead demanded
priority, writing it himself, and himself giving it into the hands of the despatching young
lady, the daughter of the Gimberley grocer, who no doubt understood the occasion perfectly.

   To Marion Fay, 17, Paradise Row, Holloway.

   It was not I who was hurt. Shall be at No. 17 by three on
   Monday.

"I wonder whether they heard it down at Trafford," said Lady Amaldina to Lady Frances. On this
subject they were informed before the day was over, as a long message came from Mr. Roberts
in compliance with the instructions from the Marquis. "Because if they did what a terrible
disappointment my aunt will have to bear."

"Do not say anything so horrible," said Lady Frances.

"I always look upon Aunt Clara as though she were not quite in her right senses about her own
children. She thinks a great injury is done her because her son is not the heir. Now for a
moment she will have believed that it was so." This, however, was a view of the matter which
Lady Frances found herself unable to discuss.

"He's going to get well after all," said Hautboy that evening, just before dinner. He had been
running over to the inn every hour to ask after the condition of poor Walker. At first the
tidings had been gloomy enough. The doctor had only been able to say that he needn't die because
of his broken bones. Then late in the afternoon there arrived a surgeon from London who gave
something of a stronger hope. The young man's consciousness had come back to him, and he had
expressed an appreciation for brandy and water. It was this fact which had seemed so promising
to young Lord Hautboy. On the Saturday there came Mrs. Walker and Miss Walker, and before the
Sunday evening it was told how the patient had signified his intention of hunting again on
the first possible opportunity. "I always knew he was a brick," said Hautboy, as he repeated
the story, "because he always would ride at everything."

"I don't think he'll ever ride again at the fence just out of Gimberley Wood," said Lord Hampstead.
They were all able to start on the Monday morning without serious concern, as the accounts
from the injured man's bed-room were still satisfactory. That he had broken three ribs, a collar-bone,
and an arm seemed to be accounted as nothing. Nor was there much made of the scalp wound on
his head, which had come from a kick the horse gave him in the struggle. As his brains were
still there, that did not much matter. His cheek had been cut open by a stake on which he fell,
but the scar, it was thought, would only add to his glories. It was the pressure of the horse
which had fallen across his body which the doctors feared. But Hautboy very rightly argued
that there couldn't be much danger, seeing that he had recovered his taste for brandy and water.
"If it wasn't for that," said Hautboy, "I don't think I'd have gone away and left him."

Lord Hampstead found, when he reached home on the Monday morning, that his troubles were not
yet over. The housekeeper came out and wept, almost with her arms round his neck. The groom,
and the footman, and the gardener, even the cowboy himself, flocked about him, telling stories
of the terrible condition in which they had been left after the coming of the Quaker on the
Friday evening. "I didn't never think I'd ever see my lord again," said the cook solemnly.
"I didn't a'most hope it," said the housemaid, "after hearing the Quaker gentleman read it
all out of the newspaper." Lord Hampstead shook hands with them all, and laughed at the misfortune
of the false telegram, and endeavoured to be well pleased with everything, but it occurred
to him to think what must have been the condition of Mr. Fay's house that night, when he had
come across from Holloway through the darkness and rain to find out for his girl what might
be the truth or falsehood of the report which had reached him.

At 3.0 punctually he was in Paradise Row. Perhaps it was not unnatural that even then his advent
should create emotion. As he turned down from the main road the very potboy from "The Duchess"
rushed up to him, and congratulated him on his escape. "I have had nothing to escape," said
Lord Hampstead trying to pass on. But Mrs. Grimley saw him, and came out to him. "Oh, my lord,
we are so thankful;--indeed, we are."

"You are very good, ma'am," said the lord.

"And now, Lord 'Ampstead, mind and be true to that dear young lady who was well-nigh heart-broke
when she heard as it were you who was smashed up."

He was hurrying on finding it impossible to make any reply to this, when Miss Demijohn, seeing
that Mrs. Grimley had been bold enough to address the noble visitor to their humble street,
remembering how much she had personally done in the matter, having her mind full of the important
fact that she had been the first to give information on the subject to the Row generally, thinking
that no such appropriate occasion as this would ever again occur for making personal acquaintance
with the lord, rushed out from her own house, and seized the young man's hand before he was
able to defend himself. "My lord," she said, "my lord, we were all so depressed when we heard
of it."

"Were you, indeed?"

"All the Row was depressed, my lord. But I was the first who knew it. It was I who communicated
the sad tidings to Miss Fay. It was, indeed, my lord. I saw it in the Evening Tell-Tale, and
went across with the paper at once."

"That was very good of you."

"Thank'ee, my lord. And, therefore, seeing you and knowing you,--for we all know you now in
Paradise Row--"

"Do you now?"

"Every one of us, my lord. Therefore I thought I'd just make bold to come out and introduce
myself. Here's Mrs. Duffer. I hope you'll let me introduce you to Mrs. Duffer of No. 15. Mrs.
Duffer, Lord Hampstead. And oh, my lord, it will be such an honour to the Row if anything of
that kind should happen."

Lord Hampstead, having with his best grace gone through the ceremony of shaking hands with
Mrs. Duffer, who had come up to him and Clara just at the step of the Quaker's house, was at
last allowed to knock at the door. Miss Fay would be with him in a minute, said the old woman
as she showed him into the sitting-room up-stairs.

Marion, as soon as she heard the knock, ran for a moment to her own bed-room. Was it not much
to her that he was with her again, not only alive, but uninjured, that she should again hear
his voice, and see the light of his countenance, and become aware once more of a certain almost
heavenly glory which seemed to surround her when she was in his presence? She was aware that
on such occasions she felt herself to be lifted out of her ordinary prosaic life, and to be
for a time floating, as it were, in some upper air; among the clouds, indeed;--alas, yes; but
among clouds which were silver-lined; in a heaven which could never be her own, but in which
she could dwell, though it were but for an hour or two, in ecstasy,--if only he would allow
her to do so without troubling her with further prayer. Then there came across her a thought
that if only she could so begin this interview with him that it might seem to be an occasion
of special joy,--as though it were a thanksgiving because he had come back to her safe,--she
might, at any rate for this day, avoid words from him which might drive her again to refuse
his great request. He already knew that she loved him, must know of what value to her must
be his life, must understand how this had come at first a terrible, crushing, killing sorrow,
and then a relief which by the excess of its joy must have been almost too much for her. Could
she not let all that be a thing acknowledged between them, which might be spoken of as between
dearest friends, without any allusion for the present to that request which could never be granted?

But he, as he waited there a minute or two, was minded to make quite another use of the interview.
He was burning to take her in his arms as his own, to press his lips to hers and know that
she returned his caress, to have the one word spoken which would alone suffice to satisfy the
dominating spirit of the man within him. Had she acceded to his request, then his demand would
have been that she should at once become his wife, and he would not have rested at peace till
he had reduced her months to weeks. He desired to have it all his own way. He had drawn her
into his presence as soon almost as he had seen her. He had forced upon her his love. He had
driven her to give him her heart, and to acknowledge that it was so. Of course he must go on
with his triumph over her. She must be his altogether, from the crown of her head to the soles
of her feet,--and that without delay. His hunting and his yacht, his politics and his friendships,
were nothing to him without Marion Fay. When she came into the room, his heart was in sympathy
with her, but by no means his mind.

"My lord," she said, letting her hand lie willingly between the pressure of his two, "you may
guess what we suffered when we heard the report, and how we felt when we learnt the truth."

"You got my telegram? I sent it as soon as I began to understand how foolish the people had been."

"Oh yes, my lord. It was so good of you!"

"Marion, will you do something for me?"

"What shall I do, my lord?"

"Don't call me, 'my lord.'"

"But it is proper."

"It is most improper, and abominable, and unnatural."

"Lord Hampstead!"

"I hate it. You and I can understand each other, at any rate."

"I hope so."

"I hate it from everybody. I can't tell the servants not to do it. They wouldn't understand
me. But from you! It seems always as though you were laughing at me."

"Laugh at you!"

"You may if you like it. What is it you may not do with me? If it were really a joke, if you
were quizzing, I shouldn't mind it." He held her hand the whole time, and she did not attempt
to withdraw it. What did her hand signify? If she could only so manage with him on that day
that he should be satisfied to be happy, and not trouble her with any request. "Marion," he
said, drawing her towards him.

"Sit down, my lord. Well. I won't. You shan't be called my lord to-day, because I am so happy
to see you;--because you have had so great an escape."

"But I didn't have any escape."

If only she could keep him in this way! If he would only talk to her about anything but his
passion! "It seemed to me so, of course. Father was broken-hearted about it. He was as bad
as I. Think of father going down without his tea to Hendon Hall, and driving the poor people
there all out of their wits."

"Everybody was out of his wits."

"I was," she said, bobbing her head at him. She was just so far from him, she thought, as to
be safe from any impetuous movement. "And Hannah was nearly as bad." Hannah was the old woman.
"You may imagine we had a wretched night of it."

"And all about nothing," said he, falling into her mood in the moment. "But think of poor Walker."

"Yes, indeed! I suppose he has friends, too, who loved him, as--as some people love you. But
he is not going to die?"

"I hope not. Who is that young woman opposite who rushed out to me in the street? She says
she brought you the news first."

"Miss Demijohn."

"Is she a friend of yours?"

"No," said Marion, blushing as she spoke the word very firmly.

"I am rather glad of that, because I didn't fall in love with her. She introduced me to ever
so many of the neighbours. The landlady of the public-house was one, I think."

"I am afraid they have offended you among them."

"Not in the least. I never take offence except when I think people mean it. But now, Marion,
say one word to me."

"I have said many words. Have I not said nice words?"

"Every word out of your mouth is like music to me. But there is one word which I am dying to hear."

"What word?" she said. She knew that she should not have asked the question, but it was so
necessary for her to put off the evil if it were only for a moment.

"It is whatever word you may choose to use when you speak to me as my wife. My mother used
to call me John; the children call me Jack; my friends call me Hampstead. Invent something
sweet for yourself. I always call you Marion because I love the sound so dearly."

"Every one calls me Marion."

"No! I never did so till I had told myself that, if possible, you should be my own. Do you
remember when you poked the fire for me at Hendon Hall?"

"I do;--I do. It was wrong of me; was it not;--when I hardly knew you?"

"It was beyond measure good of you; but I did not dare to call you Marion then, though I knew
your name as well as I do now, Marion! I have it here, written all round my heart." What could
she say to a man who spoke to her after this fashion? It was as though an angel from heaven
were courting her! If only she could have gone on listening so that nothing further should
come of it! "Find some name for me, and tell me that it shall be written round your heart."

"Indeed it is. You know it is, Lord Hampstead."

"But what name?"

"Your friend;--your friend of friends."

"It will not do. It is cold."

"Then it is untrue to her from whom it comes. Do you think that my friendship is cold for you?"

She had turned towards him, and was sitting before him with her face looking into his, with
her hands clasped as though in assurance of her truth;--when suddenly he had her in his arms
and had pressed his lips to hers. In a moment she was standing in the middle of the room. Though
he was strong, her strength was sufficient for her. "My lord!" she exclaimed.

"Ah, you are angry with me?"

"My lord, my lord,--I did not think you would treat me like that."

"But, Marion; do you not love me?"

"Have I not told you that I do? Have I not been true and honest to you? Do you not know it
all?" But in truth he did not know it all. "And now I must bid you never, never to come again."

"But I shall come. I will come. I will come always. You will not cease to love me?"

"No;--not that--I cannot do that. But you must not come. You have done that which makes me
ashamed of myself." At that moment the door was opened, and Mrs. Roden came into the room.

CHAPTER XXI.

DI CRINOLA.

The reader must submit to have himself carried back some weeks,--to those days early in January,
when Mrs. Roden called upon her son to accompany her to Italy. Indeed, he must be carried back
a long way beyond that; but the time during which he need be so detained shall be short. A
few pages will suffice to tell so much of the early life of this lady as will be necessary
to account for her residence in Paradise Row.

Mary Roden, the lady whom we have known as Mrs. Roden, was left an orphan at the age of fifteen,
her mother having died when she was little more than an infant. Her father was an Irish clergyman
with no means of his own but what he secured from a small living; but his wife had inherited
money amounting to about eight thousand pounds, and this had descended to Mary when her father
died. The girl was then taken in charge by a cousin of her own, a lady ten years her senior
who had lately married, and whom we have since met as Mrs. Vincent, living at Wimbledon. Mr.
Vincent had been well connected and well-to-do in the world, and till he died the household
in which Mary Roden had been brought up had been luxurious as well as comfortable. Nor did
Mr. Vincent die till after his wife's cousin had found a husband for herself. Soon afterwards
he was gathered to his fathers, leaving to his widow a comfortable, but not more than a comfortable,
income.

The year before his death he and his wife had gone into Italy, rather on account of his health
than for pleasure, and had then settled themselves at Verona for a winter,--a winter which
eventually stretched itself into nearly a year, at the close of which Mr. Vincent died. But
before that event took place Mary Roden had become a wife.

At Verona, at first at the house of her own cousin,--which was of course her own home,--and
afterwards in the society of the place to which the Vincents had been made welcome,--Mary met
a young man who was known to all the world as the Duca di Crinola. No young man more beautiful
to look at, more charming in manners, more ready in conversation, was then known in those parts
of Italy than this young nobleman. In addition to these good gifts, he was supposed to have
in his veins the very best blood in all Europe. It was declared on his behalf that he was related
to the Bourbons and to the Hapsburgh family. Indeed there was very little of the best blood
which Europe had produced in the last dozen centuries of which some small proportion was not
running in his veins. He was too the eldest son of his father, who, though he possessed the
most magnificent palace in Verona, had another equally magnificent in Venice, in which it suited
him to live with his Duchessa. As the old nobleman did not come often to Verona, and as the
young nobleman never went to Venice, the father and son did not see much of each other, an
arrangement which was supposed to have its own comforts, as the young man was not disturbed
in the possession of his hotel, and as the old man was reported in Verona generally to be arbitrary,
hot-tempered, and tyrannical. It was therefore said of the young Duke by his friends that he
was nearly as well off as though he had no father at all.

But there were other things in the history of the young Duke which, as they became known to
the Vincents, did not seem to be altogether so charming. Though of all the palaces in Verona
that in which he lived was by far the most beautiful to look at from the outside, it was not
supposed to be furnished in a manner conformable to its external appearance. It was, indeed,
declared that the rooms were for the most part bare; and the young Duke never gave the lie
to these assertions by throwing them open to his friends. It was said of him also that his
income was so small and so precarious that it amounted almost to nothing, that the cross old
Duke at Venice never allowed him a shilling, and that he had done everything in his power to
destroy the hopes of a future inheritance. Nevertheless, he was beautiful to look at in regard
to his outward attire, and could hardly have been better dressed had he been able to pay his
tailor and shirt-maker quarterly. And he was a man of great accomplishments, who could talk
various languages, who could paint, and model, and write sonnets, and dance to perfection.
And he could talk of virtue, and in some sort seem to believe in it,--though he would sometimes
confess of himself that Nature had not endowed him with the strength necessary for the performance
of all the good things which he so thoroughly appreciated.

Such as he was he entirely gained the affection of Mary Roden. It is unnecessary here to tell
the efforts that were made by Mrs. Vincent to prevent the marriage. Had she been less austere
she might, perhaps, have prevailed with the girl. But as she began by pointing out to her cousin
the horror of giving herself, who had been born and bred a Protestant, to a Roman Catholic,--and
also of bestowing her English money upon an Italian,--all that she said was without effect.
The state of Mr. Vincent's health made it impossible for them to move, or Mary might perhaps
have been carried back to England. When she was told that the man was poor, she declared that
there was so much the more reason why her money should be given to relieve the wants of the
man she loved. It ended in their being married, and all that Mr. Vincent was able to accomplish
was to see that the marriage ceremony should be performed after the fashion both of the Church
of England and of the Church of Rome. Mary at the time was more than twenty-one, and was thus
able, with all the romance of girlhood, to pour her eight thousand pounds into the open hands
of her thrice-noble and thrice-beautiful lover.

The Duchino with his young Duchessina went their way rejoicing, and left poor Mr. Vincent to
die at Verona. Twelve months afterwards the widow had settled herself at the house at Wimbledon,
from which she had in latter years paid her weekly visits to Paradise Row, and tidings had
come from the young wife which were not altogether satisfactory. The news, indeed, which declared
that a young little Duke had been born to her was accompanied by expressions of joy which the
other surrounding incidents of her life were not permitted at the moment altogether to embitter.
Her baby, her well-born beautiful baby, was for a few months allowed to be a joy to her, even
though things were otherwise very sorrowful. But things were very sorrowful. The old Duke and
the old Duchess would not acknowledge her. Then she learned that the quarrel between the father
and son had been carried to such a pitch that no hope of reconciliation remained. Whatever
was left of family property was gone as far as any inheritance on the part of the elder son
was concerned. He had himself assisted in making over to a second brother all right that he
possessed in the property belonging to the family. Then tidings of horror accumulated itself
upon her and her baby. Then came tidings that her husband had been already married when he
first met her,--which tidings did not reach her till he had left her alone, somewhere up among
the Lakes, for an intended absence of three days. After that day she never saw him again. The
next she heard of him was from Italy, from whence he wrote to her to tell her that she was
an angel, and that he, devil as he was, was not fit to appear in her presence. Other things
had occurred during the fifteen months in which they had lived together to make her believe
at any rate the truth of this last statement. It was not that she ceased to love him, but that
she knew that he was not fit to be loved. When a woman is bad a man can generally get quit
of her from his heartstrings;--but a woman has no such remedy. She can continue to love the
dishonoured one without dishonour to herself,--and does so.

Among other misfortunes was the loss of all her money. There she was, in the little villa on
the side of the lake, with no income,--and with statements floating about her that she had
not, and never had had, a husband. It might well be that after that she should caution Marion
Fay as to the imprudence of an exalted marriage. But there came to her assistance, if not friendship
and love, in the midst of her misfortunes. Her brother-in-law,--if she had a husband or a brother-in-law,--came
to her from the old Duke with terms of surrender; and there came also a man of business, a
lawyer, from Venice, to make good the terms if they should be accepted. Though money was very
scarce with the family, or the power of raising money, still such was the feeling of the old
nobleman in her misfortunes that the entire sum which had been given up to his eldest son should
be restored to trustees for her use and for the benefit of her baby, on condition that she
should leave Italy, and consent to drop the title of the Di Crinola family. As to that question
of a former marriage, the old lawyer declared that he was unable to give any certain information.
The reprobate had no doubt gone through some form of a ceremony with a girl of low birth at
Venice. It very probably was not a marriage. The young Duchino, the brother, declared his belief
that there had been no such marriage. But she, should she cling to the name, could not make
her title good to it without obtaining proofs which they had not been able to find. No doubt
she could call herself Duchess. Had she means at command she might probably cause herself to
be received as such. But no property would thus be affected,--nor would it rob him, the younger
son, of his right to call himself also by the title. The offer made to her was not ungenerous.
The family owed her nothing, but were willing to sacrifice nearly half of all they had with
the object of restoring to her the money of which the profligate had robbed her,--which he
had been enabled to take from her by her own folly and credulity. In this terrible emergency
of her life, Mrs. Vincent sent over to her a solicitor from London, between whom and the Italian
man of business a bargain was struck. The young wife undertook to drop her husband's name,
and to drop it also on behalf of her boy. Then the eight thousand pounds was repaid, and Mrs.
Roden, as she afterwards called herself, went back to Wimbledon and to England with her baby.

So far the life of George Roden's mother had been most unfortunate. After that, for a period
of sixteen years time went with her, if not altogether happily, at least quietly and comfortably.
Then there came a subject of disruption. George Roden took upon himself to have opinions of
his own; and would not hold his peace in the presence of Mrs. Vincent, to whom those opinions
were most unacceptable. And they were the more unacceptable because the mother's tone of mind
had always taken something of the bent which appeared so strongly afterwards in her son. George
at any rate could not be induced to be silent; nor,--which was worse,--could he after reaching
his twentieth year be made to go to church with that regularity which was necessary for the
elder lady's peace of mind. He at this time had achieved for himself a place in the office
ruled over by our friend Sir Boreas, and had in this way become so much of a man as to be entitled
to judge for himself. In this way there had been no quarrel between Mrs. Vincent and Mrs. Roden,
but there had come a condition of things in which it had been thought expedient that they should
live apart. Mrs. Roden had therefore taken for herself a house in Paradise Row, and those weekly
inter-visitings had been commenced between her and her cousin.

Such had been the story of Mrs. Roden's life, till tidings were received in England that her
husband was dead. The information had been sent to Mrs. Vincent by the younger son of the late
old Duke, who was now a nobleman well known in the political life of his own country. He had
stated that, to the best of his belief, his brother's first union had not been a legal marriage.
He thought it right, he had said, to make this statement, and to say that as far as he was
concerned he was willing to withdraw that compact upon which his father had insisted. If his
sister-in-law wished to call herself by the name and title of Di Crinola, she might do so.
Or if the young man of whom he spoke as his nephew wished to be known as Duca di Crinola he
would raise no objection. But it must be remembered that he had nothing to offer to his relative
but the barren tender of the name. He himself had succeeded to but very little, and that which
he possessed had not been taken from his brother.

Then there were sundry meetings between Mrs. Vincent and Mrs. Roden, at which it was decided
that Mrs. Roden should go to Italy with her son. Her brother-in-law had been courteous to her,
and had offered to receive her if she would come. Should she wish to use the name of Di Crinola,
he had promised that she should be called by it in his house; so that the world around might
know that she was recognized by him and his wife and children. She determined that she would
at any rate make the journey, and that she would take her son with her.

George Roden had hitherto learnt nothing of his father or his family. In the many consultations
held between his mother and Mrs. Vincent it had been decided that it would be better to keep
him in the dark. Why fill his young imagination with the glory of a great title in order that
he might learn at last, as might too probably be the case, that he had no right to the name,--no
right to consider himself even to be his father's son? She, by her folly,--so she herself acknowledged,--had
done all that was possible to annihilate herself as a woman. There was no name which she could
give to her son as certainly as her own. This, which had been hers before she had been allured
into a mock marriage, would at any rate not be disputed. And thus he had been kept in ignorance
of his mother's story. Of course he had asked. It was no more than natural that he should ask.
But when told that it was for his mother's comfort that he should ask no more, he had assented
with that reticence which was peculiar to him. Then chance had thrown him into friendship with
the young English nobleman, and the love of Lady Frances Trafford had followed.

His mother, when he consented to accompany her, had almost promised him that all mysteries
should be cleared up between them before their return. In the train, before they reached Paris,
a question was asked and an answer given which served to tell much of the truth. As they came
down to breakfast that morning, early in the dark January morning, he observed that his mother
was dressed in deep mourning. It had always been her custom to wear black raiment. He could
not remember that he had ever seen on her a coloured dress, or even a bright ribbon. And she
was not now dressed quite as is a widow immediately on the death of her husband. It was now
a quarter of a century since she had seen the man who had so ill-used her. According to the
account which she had received, it was twelve months at least since he had died in one of the
Grecian islands. The full weeds of a mourning widow would ill have befitted her condition of
mind, or her immediate purpose. But yet there was a speciality of blackness in her garments
which told him that she had dressed herself with a purpose as of mourning. "Mother," he said
to her in the train, "you are in mourning,--as for a friend?" Then when she paused he asked
again, "May I not be told for whom it is done? Am I not right in saying that it is so?"

"It is so, George."

"For whom then?"

They two were alone in the carriage, and why should his question not be answered now? But it
had come to pass that there was a horror to her in mentioning the name of his father to him.
"George," she said, "it is more than twenty-five years since I saw your father."

"Is he dead--only now?"

"It is only now,--only the other day,--that I have heard of his death."

"Why should not I also be in black?"

"I had not thought of it. But you never saw him since he had you in his arms as a baby. You
cannot mourn for him in heart."

"Do you?"

"It is hard to say for what we mourn sometimes. Of course I loved him once. There is still
present to me a memory of what I loved,--of the man who won my heart by such gifts as belonged
to him; and for that I mourn. He was beautiful and clever, and he charmed me. It is hard to
say sometimes for what we mourn."

"Was he a foreigner, mother?"

"Yes, George. He was an Italian. You shall know it all soon now. But do not you mourn. To you
no memories are left. Were it not for the necessity of the present moment, no idea of a father
should ever be presented to you." She vouchsafed to tell him no more at that moment, and he
pressed her with no further questions.

CHAPTER I.

"I WILL COME BACK AS I WENT."

While Lord Hampstead's party were at Gorse Hall, some weeks before poor Walker's accident,
there came a letter from George Roden to Lady Frances, and she, when she reached Hendon Hall,
found a second. Both these letters, or parts of them, shall be here given, as they will tell
all that need be added to what is already known of the story of the man, and will explain to
the reader the cause and manner of action which he adopted.

   Rome,
   January 30th, 18--.

   DEAREST FANNY,--

   I wonder whether it will seem as odd to you to receive a
   letter from me written at Rome as it is to me to write it.
   Our letters hitherto have been very few in number, and
   have only declared that in spite of obstacles we shall
   always love each other. I have never before had anything
   in truth to tell you; but now I have so much that I do not
   know how to begin or how to go on with it. But it must be
   written, as there is much that will interest you as my
   dearest friend, and much also that will concern yourself
   should you ever become my wife. It may be that a point
   will arise as to which you and your friends,--your father,
   for instance, and your brother,--will feel yourselves
   entitled to have a voice in deciding. It may be quite
   possible that your judgment, or, at any rate, that of your
   friends, may differ from my own. Should it be so I cannot
   say that I shall be prepared to yield; but I will, at
   any rate, enable you to submit the case to them with all
   fairness.

   I have told you more than once how little I have known
   of my own family,--that I have known indeed nothing. My
   mother has seemed to me to be perversely determined not to
   tell me all that which I will acknowledge I have thought
   that I ought to know. But with equal perversity I have
   refrained from asking questions on a subject of which
   I think I should have been told everything without
   questioning. And I am a man not curious by nature as to
   the past. I am more anxious as to what I may do myself
   than as to what others of my family may have done before
   me.

   When, however, my mother asked me to go with her to Italy,
   it was manifest that her journey had reference to her
   former life. I knew from circumstances which could not
   be hidden from me,--from her knowledge, for instance, of
   Italian, and from some relics which remained to her of her
   former life,--that she had lived for some period in this
   country. As my place of birth had never been mentioned to
   me, I could not but guess that I had been born in Italy,
   and when I found that I was going there I felt certain
   that I must learn some portion of the story of which I had
   been kept in ignorance. Now I have learnt it all as far as
   my poor mother knows it herself; and as it will concern
   you to know it too, I must endeavour to explain to you all
   the details. Dearest Fanny, I do trust that when you have
   heard them you will think neither worse of me on that
   account,--nor better. It is as to the latter that I am
   really in fear. I wish to believe that no chance attribute
   could make me stand higher in your esteem than I have come
   to stand already by my own personal character.

Then he told her,--not, perhaps, quite so fully as the reader has heard it told in the last
chapter,--the story of his mother's marriage and of his own birth. Before they had reached
Rome, where the Duca di Crinola at present lived, and where he was at present a member of the
Italian Cabinet, the mother had told her son all that she knew, having throughout the telling
of the story unconsciously manifested to him her own desire to remain in obscurity, and to
bear the name which had been hers for five-and-twenty years; but at the same time so to manage
that he should return to England bearing the title to which by his birth she believed him to
be entitled. When in discussing this he explained to her that it would be still necessary for
him to earn his bread as a clerk in the Post Office in spite of his high-sounding nobility,
and explained to her the absurdity of his sitting in Mr. Jerningham's room at the desk with
young Crocker, and calling himself at the same time the Duca di Crinola, she in her arguments
exhibited a weakness which he had hardly expected from her. She spoke vaguely, but with an
assurance of personal hope, of Lady Frances, of Lord Hampstead, of the Marquis of Kingsbury,
and of Lord Persiflage,--as though by the means of these noble personages the Duca di Crinola
might be able to live in idleness. Of all this Roden could say nothing in this first letter
to Lady Frances. But it was to this that he alluded when he hoped that she would not think
better of him because of the news which he sent her.

"At present," he wrote, continuing his letter after the telling of the story,

   we are staying with my uncle, as I presume I am entitled
   to call him. What does the letters does not connote? The fact;
   that idiom; same chapter with what was much writer; no it and

Nor would the Marquis be actuated by any prayer of hers in reference to the carving of the
property. It would be better for her to accept the young Duke and the young Duchess, and make
the best of them. If only the story should at last be shown to be true!

The duty was imposed on her of communicating the story to the Marquis; but before she did so
she was surprised by a visit from Mr. Greenwood. Mr. Roberts had used no more than the violence
of argument, and Mr. Greenwood had been induced to take himself to Shrewsbury on the day named
for his departure. If he went he would have £200 a year from the Marquis,--and £100 would be
added by Lord Hampstead, of which the Marquis need not know anything. Unless he went on the
day fixed that £100 would not be added. A good deal was said on either side, but he went. The
Marquis had refused to see him. The Marchioness had bade him adieu in a most formal manner,--in
a manner quite unbecoming those familiar suggestions which, he thought, had been made to him
as to a specially desirable event. But he had gone, and as he went he told himself that circumstances
might yet occur in the family which might be of use to him. He, too, had heard the great family
news,--perhaps through some under-satellite of the Foreign Office, and he came with the idea
that he would be the first to make it known at Trafford Park.

He would have asked for the Marquis, but he knew that the Marquis would not receive him. Lady
Kingsbury consented to see him, and he was ushered up to the room to which he had so often
made his way without any asking. "I hope you are well, Mr. Greenwood," she said. "Are you still
staying in the neighbourhood?" It was, however, well known at Trafford that he was at Shrewsbury.

"Yes, Lady Kingsbury. I have not gone from the neighbourhood. I thought that perhaps you might
want to see me again."

"I don't know that we need trouble you, Mr. Greenwood."

"I have come with some news respecting the family." As he said this he managed to assume the
old look, and stood as though he had never moved from the place since he had last been in the room.

"Do sit down, Mr. Greenwood. What news?"

"Mr. George Roden, the clerk in the Post Office--"

But she was not going to have the tidings repeated to her by him, so as to give him any claim
to gratitude for having brought them. "You mean the Duca di Crinola!"

"Oh," exclaimed Mr. Greenwood.

"I have heard all that, Mr. Greenwood."

"That the Post Office clerk is an Italian nobleman?"

"It suited the Italian nobleman for a time to be a Post Office clerk. That is what you mean."

"And Lady Frances is to be allowed--"

"Mr. Greenwood, I must ask you not to discuss Lady Frances here."

"Oh! Not to discuss her ladyship!"

"Surely you must be aware how angry the Marquis has been about it."

"Oh!" He had not seated himself, nor divested himself of that inquisitorial appearance which
was so distasteful to her. "We used to discuss Lady Frances sometimes, Lady Kingsbury."

"I will not discuss her now. Let that be enough, Mr. Greenwood."

"Nor yet Lord Hampstead."

"Nor yet Lord Hampstead. I think it very wrong of you to come after all that took place. If
the Marquis knew it--"

Oh! If the Marquis knew it! If the Marquis knew all, and if other people knew all! If it were
known how often her ladyship had spoken, and how loud, as to the wished-for removal to a better
world of his lordship's eldest son! But he could not dare to speak it out. And yet it was cruel
on him! He had for some days felt her ladyship to be under his thumb, and now it seemed that
she had escaped from him. "Oh! very well, Lady Kingsbury. Perhaps I had better go,--just for
the present." And he went.

This served, at least, for corroboration. She did not dare to keep the secret long from her
husband, and therefore, in the course of the evening, went down with her sister's letter in
her hand. "What!" said the Marquis, when the story had been read to him. "What! Duca di Crinola."

"There can't be a doubt about it, my dear."

"And he a clerk in the Post Office?"

"He isn't a clerk in the Post Office now."

"I don't quite see what he will be then. It appears that he has inherited nothing."

"My sister says nothing."

"Then what's the good of his title. There is nothing so pernicious in the world as a pauper
aristocracy. A clerk in the Post Office is entitled to have a wife, but a poor nobleman should
at any rate let his poverty die with himself."

This was a view of the case which had not hitherto presented itself to Lady Kingsbury. When
she suggested to him that the young nobleman should be asked down to Trafford, he did not seem
to see that it was at all necessary. It would be much better that Fanny should come back. The
young nobleman would, he supposed, live in his own country;--unless, indeed, the whole tale
was a cock-and-bull story made up by Persiflage at the Foreign Office. It was just the sort
of thing, he said, that Persiflage would do. He had said not a word as to carving an income
out of the property for the young noble couple when she left him.

CHAPTER III.

ALL THE WORLD KNOWS IT.

The story was in truth all over London and half over England by the time that Lady Frances
had returned to Hendon Hall. Though Vivian had made a Foreign Office secret of the affair at
Gorse Hall, nevertheless it had been so commonly talked about during the last Sunday there,
that Hautboy had told it all to poor Walker and to the Walker ladies. "By Jove, fancy!" Hautboy
had said, "to go at once from a Post Office clerk to a duke! It's like some of those stories
where a man goes to bed as a beggar and gets up as a prince. I wonder whether he likes it."
Hampstead had of course discussed the matter very freely with his sister, still expressing
an opinion that a man could not do other than take his father's name and his father's title.
Lady Frances having thus become used to the subject was not surprised to find the following
letter from her friend Lady Amaldina when she reached her home:--

   MY DEAREST FANNY,--

   I am indeed delighted to be able to congratulate you on
   the wonderful and most romantic story which has just
   been made known to us. I was never one of those who blamed
   you very much because you had given your affections to
   a man so much below you in rank. Nevertheless, we all
   could not but feel that it was a pity that he should be
   a Post Office clerk! Now, indeed, you have reason to be
   proud! I have already read up the subject, and I find that
   the Ducas di Crinola are supposed to have the very best
   blood in Europe. There can be no doubt that one of the
   family married a Bourbon before they came to the French
   throne. I could send you all the details, only I do not
   doubt that you have found it out for yourself already.
   Another married a second cousin of that Maximilian who
   married Mary of Burgundy. One of the ladies of the family
   is supposed to have been the wife of the younger brother
   of one of the Guises, though it isn't quite certain
   whether they were ever married. But that little blot,
   my dear, will hardly affect you now. Taking the name
   altogether, I don't think there is anything higher in
   all Europe. Papa says that the Di Crinolas have always
   been doing something in Italy in the way of politics, or
   rebellion, or fighting. So it isn't as though they were
   all washed out and no longer of any account, like some of
   those we read of in history. Therefore I do think that
   you must be a very happy girl.

   I do feel so completely snuffed out, because, after all,
   the title of Merioneth was only conferred in the time
   of Charles the Second. And though there was a Lord
   Llwddythlw before that, even he was only created by
   James the First. The Powells no doubt are a very old
   Welsh family, and it is supposed that there was some
   relationship between them and the Tudors. But what is that
   to be compared to the mediæval honours of the great
   House of Di Crinola?

   Papa seems to think that he will not have much fortune.
   I am one of those who do not think that a large income is
   at all to be compared to good birth in the way of giving
   real position in the world. Of course the Duke's estates
   are supposed to be enormous, and Llwddythlw, even as an
   eldest son, is a rich man; but as far as I can see there
   is nothing but trouble comes from it. If he has anything
   to do with a provincial town in the way of rents he is
   expected to lay the first brick of every church and
   institute about the place. If anything has to be opened
   he has to open it; and he is never allowed to eat his
   dinner without having to make two or three speeches
   before and afterwards. That's what I call a great bore.
   As far as I can see you will be always able to have your
   duke with you, because he will have no abominable public
   duties to look after.

   I suppose something will have to be done as to an
   income. Llwddythlw seems to think that he ought to get
   into Parliament. At least that is what he said to papa
   the other day; for I have not seen him myself for ever so
   long. He calls in the Square every Sunday just as we have
   done lunch, and never remains above two minutes. Last
   Sunday we had not heard of this glorious news; but papa
   did see him one day at the House, and that was what he
   said. I don't see how he is to get into the House if he
   is an Italian Duke, and I don't know what he'd get by
   going there. Papa says that he might be employed in some
   diplomatic position by his own Government; but I should
   think that the Marquis could do something for him as he
   has so much at his own disposition. Every acre of the
   Merioneth property is settled upon,--well,--whoever may
   happen to be the next heir. There will sure to be an
   income. There always is. Papa says that the young dukes
   are always as well off, at any rate, as the young ravens.

   But, as I said before, what does all this signify in
   comparison with BLOOD. It does make your position, my
   dear, quite another thing from what we had expected.
   You would have kept your title no doubt; but where
   would he have been?

   I wonder whether you will be married now before August. I
   suppose not, because it doesn't seem to be quite certain
   when that wicked papa of his died; but I do hope that
   you won't. A day at last has been fixed for us;--the 20th
   of August, when, as I told you before, Lord David is to
   run away instantly after the ceremony so as to travel
   all night and open something the next morning at
   Aberdeen. I mention it now, because you will be by far
   the most remarkable of all my bevy of twenty. Of course
   your name will have been in the papers before that as
   the future Italian Duchess. That I own will be to me
   a just cause of pride. I think I have got my bevy all
   fixed at last, and I do hope that none of them will get
   married before my day. That has happened so often as
   to be quite heart-breaking. I shall cry if I find that
   you are to be married first.

   Believe me to be
   Your most affectionate friend and cousin,

   AMALDINA.

She wrote also to her future husband on the same subject;--

   DEAREST LLWDDYTHLW,--

   It was very good of you to come last Sunday, but I wish
   you hadn't gone away just because the Graiseburys were
   there. They would not have eaten you, though he is a
   Liberal.

   I have written to Fanny Trafford to congratulate her;
   because you know it is after all better than being a mere
   Post Office clerk. That was terrible;--so bad that one
   hardly knew how to mention her name in society! When
   people talked about it, I really did feel that I blushed
   all over. One can mention her name now because people
   are not supposed to know that he has got nothing.
   Nevertheless, it is very dreadful. What on earth are
   they to live on? I have told her about the young ravens.
   It was papa who said that when he first heard of this
   Di Crinola affair. I suppose a girl ought to trust in
   Providence when she marries a man without a shilling.
   That was what papa meant.

   Papa says that you said that he ought to go into
   Parliament. But what would he get by that? Perhaps
   as he is in the Post Office they might make him
   Postmaster-General. Only papa says that if he were to go
   into Parliament, then he could not call himself Duca di
   Crinola. Altogether it seems to be very sad,--though not
   quite so sad as before. It is true that one of the Di
   Crinolas married a Bourbon, and that others of them have
   married ever so many royalties. I think there ought to
   be a law for giving such people something to live upon
   out of the taxes. How are they to be expected to live
   upon nothing? I asked papa whether he couldn't get it
   done; but he said it would be a money bill, and that
   you ought to take it up. Pray don't, for fear it should
   take you all August. I know you wouldn't have a scruple
   about putting off your own little affair, if anything of
   that kind were to come in the way. I believe you'd like
   it.

   Do stop a little longer when you come on Sunday. I have
   ever so many things to say to you. And if you can think
   of anything to be done for those poor Di Crinolas,
   anything that won't take up all August,--pray do it.

   Your own,

   AMY.

One more letter shall be given; the answer, namely, to the above from the lover to his future
bride;--

   DEAR AMY,--

   I'll be at the Square on Sunday by three. I will walk out
   if you like, but it is always raining. I have to meet five
   or six conservative members later on in the afternoon as
   to the best thing to be done as to Mr. Green's Bill for
   lighting London by electricity. It would suit everybody;
   but some of our party, I am afraid, would go with them,
   and the Government is very shilly-shally. I have been
   going into the figures, and it has taken me all the week.
   Otherwise I would have been to see you.

   This Di Crinola affair is quite a romance. I did not mean
   that he ought to go into the House by way of getting an
   income. If he takes up the title of course he could not do
   so. If he takes it, he must regard himself as an Italian.
   I should think him quite as respectable, earning his
   bread as a clerk in a public office. They tell me he's a
   high-spirited fellow. If he is, that is what he will do.

   Yours affectionately,

   LLWDDYTHLW.

When Lord Persiflage spoke of the matter to Baron d'Ossi, the Italian Minister in London, the
Baron quite acknowledged the position of the young Duca, and seemed to think that very little
could be wanting to the making of the young man's fortune. "Ah, yes, your Excellency," said
the Baron. "He has no great estates. Here in England you all have great estates. It is very
nice to have great estates. But he has an uncle who is a great man in Rome. And he will have
a wife whose uncle is a very great man in London. What more should he want?" Then the Baron
bowed to the Minister of State, and the Minister of State bowed to the Baron.

But the surprise expressed and the consternation felt at the Post Office almost exceeded the
feelings excited at the Foreign Office or among Lady Fanny's family and friends. Dukes and
Ministers, Barons and Princes, are terms familiar to the frequenters of the Foreign Office.
Ambassadors, Secretaries, and diplomatic noblemen generally, are necessarily common in the
mouths of all the officials. But at the Post Office such titles still carried with them something
of awe. The very fact that a man whom they had seen should be a Duke was tremendous to the
minds of Bobbin and Geraghty; and when it became known to them that a fellow workman in their
own room, one who had in truth been no more than themselves, would henceforth be called by
so august a title, it was as though the heavens and the earth were coming together. It affected
Crocker in such a way that there was for a time a doubt whether his senses were not temporarily
leaving him,--so that confinement would become necessary. Of course the matter had found its
way into the newspapers. It became known at the office on the last day of February,--two days
before the return of the Rodens to London.

"Have you heard it, Mr. Jerningham?" said Crocker, rushing into the room that morning. He was
only ten minutes after the proper time, having put himself to the expense of a cab in his impetuous
desire to be the first to convey the great news to his fellow clerks. But he had been forestalled
in his own room by the energy of Geraghty. The condition of mind created in Mr. Jerningham's
bosom by the story told by Geraghty was of such a nature that he was unable to notice Crocker's
sin in reference to the ten minutes.

"Dchuca di Crinola!" shouted Geraghty in his broadest brogue as Crocker came in; determined
not to be done out of the honour fairly achieved by him.

"By Jove, yes! A Duke," said Crocker. "A Duke! My own especial friend! Hampstead will be nowhere;
nowhere; nowhere! Duca di Crinola! Isn't it beautiful? By George, I can't believe it. Can you,
Mr. Jerningham?"

"I don't know what to believe," said Mr. Jerningham. "Only he was always a most steady, well-behaved
young man, and the office will have a great loss of him."

"I suppose the Duke won't come and see us ever," said Bobbin. "I should like to shake hands
with him once again."

"Shake hands with him," said Crocker. "I'm sure he won't drop out like that;--my own peculiar
friend! I don't think I ever was so fond of anybody as George Ro--, the Duca di Crinola of
course I mean. By George! haven't I sat at the same table with him for the last two years!
Why, it was only a night or two before he started on this remarkable tour that I spent an evening
with him in private society at Holloway!" Then he got up and walked about the room impetuously,
clapping his hands, altogether carried away by the warmth of his feelings.

"I think you might as well sit down to your desk, Mr. Crocker," said Mr. Jerningham.

"Oh, come, bother, Mr. Jerningham!"

"I will not be spoken to in that way, Mr. Crocker."

"Upon my word, I didn't mean anything, sir. But when one has heard such news as this, how is
it possible that one should compose oneself? It's a sort of thing that never happened before,--that
one's own particular friend should turn out to be the Duca di Crinola. Did anybody ever read
anything like it in a novel? Wouldn't it act well? Can't I see the first meeting between myself
and the Duke at the Haymarket! 'Duke,' I should say--'Duke, I congratulate you on having come
to your august family title, to which no one living could do so much honour as yourself.' Bancroft
should do me. Bancroft would do me to the life, and the piece should be called the Duke's Friend.
I suppose we shall call him Duke here in England, and Duca if we happen to be in Italy together;
eh, Mr. Jerningham?"

"You had better sit down, Mr. Crocker, and try to do your work."

"I can't;--upon my word I can't. The emotion is too much for me. I couldn't do it if Æolus
were here himself. By the way, I wonder whether Sir Boreas has heard the news." Then he rushed
off, and absolutely made his way into the room of the great potentate.

"Yes, Mr. Crocker," said Sir Boreas, "I have heard it. I read the newspapers, no doubt, as
well as you do."

"But it's true, Sir Boreas?"

"I heard it spoken of two or three days ago, Mr. Crocker, and I believe it to be true."

"He was my friend, Sir Boreas; my particular friend. Isn't it a wonderful thing,--that one's
particular friend should turn out to be Duca di Crinola! And he didn't know a word of it himself.
I feel quite sure that he didn't know a word of it."

"I really can't say, Mr. Crocker; but as you have now expressed your wonder, perhaps you had
better go back to your room and do your work."

"He pretends he knew it three days ago!" said Crocker, as he returned to his room. "I don't
believe a word of it. He'd have written to me had it been known so long ago as that. I suppose
he had too many things to think of, or he would have written to me."

"Go aisy, Crocker," said Geraghty.

"What do you mean by that? It's just the thing he would have done."

"I don't believe he ever wrote to you in his life," said Bobbin.

"You don't know anything about it. We were here together two years before you came into the
office. Mr. Jerningham knows that we were always friends. Good heavens! Duca di Crinola! I
tell you what it is, Mr. Jerningham. If it were ever so, I couldn't do anything to-day. You
must let me go. There are mutual friends of ours to whom it is quite essential that I should
talk it over." Then he took his hat and marched off to Holloway, and would have told the news
to Miss Clara Demijohn had he succeeded in finding that young lady at home. Clara was at that
moment discussing with Mrs. Duffer the wonderful fact that Mr. Walker and not Lord Hampstead
had been kicked and trodden to pieces at Gimberley Green.

But even Æolus, great as he was, expressed himself with some surprise that afternoon to Mr.
Jerningham as to the singular fortune which had befallen George Roden. "I believe it to be
quite true, Mr. Jerningham. These wonderful things do happen sometimes."

"He won't stay with us, Sir Boreas, I suppose?"

"Not if he is Duca di Crinola. I don't think we could get on with a real duke. I don't know
how it will turn out. If he chooses to remain an Englishman he can't take the title. If he
chooses to take the title he must be an Italian, then he'll have nothing to live on. My belief
is we shan't see him any more. I wish it had been Crocker with all my heart."

CHAPTER IV.

"IT SHALL BE DONE."

Lord Hampstead has been left standing for a long time in Marion Fay's sitting-room after the
perpetration of his great offence, and Mrs. Roden has been standing there also, having come
to the house almost immediately after her return home from her Italian journey. Hampstead,
of course, knew most of the details of the Di Crinola romance, but Marion had as yet heard
nothing of it. There had been so much for him to say to her during the interview which had
been so wretchedly interrupted by his violence that he had found no time to mention to her
the name either of Roden or of Di Crinola.

"You have done that which makes me ashamed of myself." These had been Marion's last words as
Mrs. Roden entered the room. "I didn't know Lord Hampstead was here," said Mrs. Roden.

"Oh, Mrs. Roden, I'm so glad you are come," exclaimed Marion. This of course was taken by the
lady as a kindly expression of joy that she should have returned from her journey; whereas
to Hampstead it conveyed an idea that Marion was congratulating herself that protection had
come to her from further violence on his part. Poor Marion herself hardly knew her own meaning,--hardly
had any. She could not even tell herself that she was angry with her lover. It was probable
that the very ecstacy of his love added fuel to hers. If a lover so placed as were this lover,--a
lover who had come to her asking her to be his wife, and who had been received with the warmest
assurance of her own affection for him,--if he were not justified in taking her in his arms
and kissing her, when might a lover do so? The ways of the world were known to her well enough
to make her feel that it was so, even in that moment of her perturbation. Angry with him! How
could she be angry with him? He had asked her, and she had declared to him that she was not
angry. Nevertheless she had been quite in earnest when she had said that now,--after the thing
that he had done,--he must "never, never come to her again."

She was not angry with him, but with herself she was angry. At the moment, when she was in
his arms, she bethought herself how impossible had been the conditions she had imposed upon
him. That he should be assured of her love, and yet not allowed to approach her as a lover!
That he should be allowed to come there in order that she might be delighted in looking at
him, in hearing his voice, in knowing and feeling that she was dear to him; but that he should
be kept at arm's length because she had determined that she should not become his wife! That
they should love each other dearly; but each with a different idea of love! It was her fault
that he should be there in her presence at all. She had told herself that it was her duty to
sacrifice herself, but she had only half carried out her duty. Should she not have kept her
love to herself,--so that he might have left her, as he certainly would have done had she behaved
to him coldly, and as her duty had required of her. She had longed for some sweetness which
would be sweet to her though only a vain encouragement to him. She had painted for her own
eyes a foolish picture, had dreamed a silly dream. She had fancied that for the little of life
that was left to her she might have been allowed the delight of loving, and had been vain enough
to think that her lover might be true to her and yet not suffer himself! Her sacrifice had
been altogether imperfect. With herself she was angry,--not with him. Angry with him, whose
very footfall was music to her ears! Angry with him, whose smile to her was as a light specially
sent from heaven for her behoof! Angry with him, the very energy of whose passion thrilled
her with a sense of intoxicating joy! Angry with him because she had been enabled for once,--only
for once,--to feel the glory of her life, to be encircled in the warmth of his arms, to become
conscious of the majesty of his strength! No,--she was not angry. But he must be made to understand,--he
must be taught to acknowledge,--that he must never, never come to her again. The mind can conceive
a joy so exquisite that for the enjoyment of it, though it may last but for a moment, the tranquillity,
even the happiness, of years may be given in exchange. It must be so with her. It had been
her own doing, and if the exchange were a bad one, she must put up with the bargain. He must
never come again. Then Mrs. Roden had entered the room, and she was forced to utter whatever
word of welcome might first come to her tongue.

"Yes," said Hampstead, trying to smile, as though nothing had happened which called for special
seriousness of manner, "I am here. I am here, and hope to be here often and often till I shall
have succeeded in taking our Marion to another home."

"No," said Marion faintly, uttering her little protest ever so gently.

"You are very constant, my lord," said Mrs. Roden.

"I suppose a man is constant to what he really loves best. But what a history you have brought
back with you, Mrs. Roden! I do not know whether I am to call you Mrs. Roden."

"Certainly, my lord, you are to call me so."

"What does it mean?" asked Marion.

"You have not heard," he said. "I have not been here time enough to tell her all this, Mrs. Roden."

"You know it then, Lord Hampstead?"

"Yes, I know it;--though Roden has not condescended to write me a line. What are we to call
him?" To this Mrs. Roden made no answer on the spur of the moment. "Of course he has written
to Fanny, and all the world knows it. It seems to have reached the Foreign Office first, and
to have been sent down from thence to my people at Trafford. I suppose there isn't a club in
London at which it has not been repeated a hundred times that George Roden is not George Roden."

"Not George Roden?" asked Marion.

"No, dearest. You will show yourself terribly ignorant if you call him so."

"What is he then, my lord?"

"Marion!"

"I beg your pardon. I will not do it again this time. But what is he?"

"He is the Duca di Crinola."

"Duke!" said Marion.

"That's what he is, Marion."

"Have they made him that over there?" 

Oh he was with fire-- this simplification and readmission into natures have been forward to yield
Expression may so. "there are, do not of threshold, of side," she said, "which can ask she tell nothing

 "I am not quite sure whether I may
not have to go to Trafford; and if so there shall be the love-letter. I feel conscious, Mrs.
Roden, of being incapable of writing a proper love-letter. 'Dearest Marion, I am yours, and
you are mine. Always believe me ever thine.' I don't know how to go beyond that. When a man
is married, and can write about the children, or the leg of mutton, or what's to be done with
his hunters, then I dare say it becomes easy. Good-bye dearest. Good-bye, Mrs. Roden. I wish
I could keep on calling you Duchess in revenge for all the 'my lordings.'" Then he left them.

There was a feeling in the mind of both of them that he had conducted himself just as a man
would do who was in a high good-humour at having been permanently accepted by the girl to whom
he had offered his hand. Marion Fay knew that it was not so;--knew that it never could be so.
Mrs. Roden knew that it had not been so when she had left home, now nearly two months since;
and knew also that Marion had pledged herself that it should not be so. The young lord then
had been too strong with his love. A feeling of regret came over her as she remembered that
the reasons against such a marriage were still as strong as ever. But yet how natural that
it should be so! Was it possible that such a lover as Lord Hampstead should not succeed in
his love if he were constant to it himself? Sorrow must come of it,--perhaps a tragedy so bitter
that she could hardly bring herself to think of it. And Marion had been so firm in her resolve
that it should not be so. But yet it was natural, and she could not bring herself to express
to the girl either anger or disappointment. "Is it to be?" she said, putting on her sweetest smile.

"No!" said Marion, standing up suddenly,--by no means smiling as she spoke! "It is not to be.
Why do you look at me like that, Mrs. Roden? Did I not tell you before you went that it should
never be so?"

"But he treats you as though he were engaged to you?"

"How can I help it? What can I do to prevent it? When I bid him go, he still comes back again,
and when I tell him that I can never be his wife he will not believe me. He knows that I love him."

"You have told him that?"

"Told him! He wanted no telling. Of course he knew it. Love him! Oh, Mrs. Roden, if I could
die for him, and so have done with it! And yet I would not wish to leave my dear father. What
am I to do, Mrs. Roden?"

"But it seemed to me just now that you were so happy with him."

"I am never happy with him;--but yet I am as though I were in heaven."

"Marion!"

"I am never happy. I know that it cannot be, that it will not be, as he would have it. I know
that I am letting him waste his sweetness all in vain. There should be some one else, oh, so
different from me! There should be one like himself, beautiful, strong in health, with hot
eager blood in her veins, with a grand name, with grand eyes and a broad brow and a noble figure,
one who, in taking his name, will give him as much as she takes--one, above all, who will not
pine and fade before his eyes, and trouble him during her short life with sickness and doctors
and all the fading hopes of a hopeless invalid. And yet I let him come, and I have told him
how dearly I love him. He comes and he sees it in my eyes. And then it is so glorious, to be
loved as he loves. Oh, Mrs. Roden, he kissed me." That to Mrs. Roden did not seem to be extraordinary;
but, not knowing what to say to it at the moment, she also kissed the girl. "Then I told him
that he must go, and never come back to me again."

"Were you angry with him?"

"Angry with him! With myself I was angry. I had given him the right to do it. How could I be
angry with him? And what does it matter;--except for his sake? If he could only understand!
If he would only know that I am in earnest when I speak to him! But I am weak in everything
except one thing. He will never make me say that I will be his wife."

"My Marion! Dear Marion!"

"But father wishes it."

"Wishes you to become his wife?"

"He wishes it. Why should I not be like any other girl, he says. How can I tell him? How can
I say that I am not like to other girls because of my darling, my own dearest mother? And yet
he does not know it. He does not see it, though he has seen so much. He will not see it till
I am there, on my bed, unable to come to him when he wants me."

"There is nothing now to show him or me that you may not live to be old as he is."

"I shall not live to be old. You know that I shall not live to be more than young. Have any
of them lived? For my father,--for my dear father,--he must find it out for himself. I have
sometimes thought that even yet I might last his time--that I might be with him to the end.
It might be so,--only that all this tortures me."

"Shall I tell him;--shall I tell Lord Hampstead?"

"He must at any rate be told. He is not bound to me as my father is. For him there need be
no great sorrow." At this Mrs. Roden shook her head. "Must it be so?"

"If he is banished from your presence he will not bear it lightly."

"Will a young man love me like that;--a young man who has so much in the world to occupy him?
He has his ship, and his hounds, and his friends, and his great wealth. It is only girls, I
think, who love like that."

"He must bear his sorrow as others do."

"But it shall be made as light as I can make it,--shall it not? I should have done this before.
I should have done it sooner. Had he been made to go away at once, then he would not have suffered.
Why would he not go when I told him? Why would he not believe me when I spoke to him? I should
have heard all his words and never have answered him even with a smile. I should not have trembled
when he told me that I was there, at his hearth, as a friend. But who thought then, Mrs. Roden,
that this young nobleman would have really cared for the Quaker girl?"

"I saw it, Marion."

"Could you see just by looking at him that he was so different from others? Are his truth,
and his loving heart, and his high honour, and his pure honesty, all written in his eyes,--to
you as they are to me? But, Mrs. Roden, there shall be an end of it! Though it may kill me,--though
it may for a little time half-break his heart,--it shall be done! Oh, that his dear heart should
be half-broken for me! I will think of it, Mrs. Roden, to-night. If writing may do it, perhaps
I may write. Or, perhaps, I may say a word that he will at least understand. If not you shall
tell him. But, Mrs. Roden, it shall be done!"

CHAPTER V.

MARION WILL CERTAINLY HAVE HER WAY.

On the day but one following there came a letter to Marion from Hampstead,--the love-letter
which he had promised her;--

   DEAR MARION--

   It is as I supposed. This affair about Roden has stirred
   them up down at Trafford amazingly. My father wants me to
   go to him. You know all about my sister. I suppose she
   will have her way now. I think the girls always do have
   their way. She will be left alone, and I have told her to
   go and see you as soon as I have gone. You should tell her
   that she ought to make him call himself by his father's
   proper name.

   In my case, dearest, it is not the girl that is to have
   her own way. It's the young man that is to do just as he
   pleases. My girl, my own one, my love, my treasure, think
   of it all, and ask yourself whether it is in your heart to
   refuse to bid me be happy. Were it not for all that you
   have said yourself I should not be vain enough to be happy
   at this moment, as I am. But you have told me that you
   love me. Ask your father, and he will tell you that, as it
   is so, it is your duty to promise to be my wife.

   I may be away for a day or two,--perhaps for a week. Write
   to me at Trafford,--Trafford Park, Shrewsbury,--and say
   that it shall be so. I sometimes think that you do not
   understand how absolutely my heart is set upon you,--so
   that no pleasures are pleasant to me, no employments
   useful, except in so far as I can make them so by thinking
   of your love.

   Dearest, dearest Marion,
   Your own,

   HAMPSTEAD.

   Remember there must not be a word about a lord inside the
   envelope. It is very bad to me when it comes from Mrs.
   Roden, or from a friend such as she is; but it simply
   excruciates me from you. It seems to imply that you are
   determined to regard me as a stranger.

She read the letter a dozen times, pressing it to her lips and to her bosom. She might do that
at least. He would never know how she treated this only letter that she ever had received from
him, the only letter that she would receive. These caresses were only such as those which came
from her heart, to relieve her solitude. It might be absurd in her to think of the words he
had spoken, and to kiss the lines which he had written. Were she now on her deathbed that would
be permitted to her. Wherever she might lay her head till the last day should come that letter
should be always within her reach. "My girl, my own one, my love, my treasure!" How long would
it last with him? Was it not her duty to hope that the words were silly words, written as young
men do write, having no eagerness of purpose,--just playing with the toy of the moment? Could
it be that she should wish them to be true, knowing, as she did, that his girl, his love, his
treasure, as he called her, could never be given up to him? And yet she did believe them to
be true, knew them to be true, and took an exceeding joy in the assurance. It was as though
the beauty and excellence of their truth atoned to her for all else that was troublous to her
in the condition of her life. She had not lived in vain. Her life now could never be a vain
and empty space of time, as it had been consecrated and ennobled and blessed by such a love
as this. And yet she must make the suffering to him as light as possible. Though there might
be an ecstasy of joy to her in knowing that she was loved, there could be nothing akin to that
in him. He wanted his treasure, and she could only tell him that he might never have it. "Think
of it all, and ask yourself whether it is in your heart to refuse to bid me be happy." It was
in her heart to do it. Though it might break her heart she would do it. It was the one thing
to do which was her paramount duty. "You have told me that you love me." Truly she had told
him so, and certainly she would never recall her words. If he ever thought of her in future
years when she should long have been at her rest,--and she thought that now and again he would
think of her, even when that noble bride should be sitting at his table,--he should always
remember that she had given him her whole heart. He had bade her write to him at Trafford.
She would obey him at once in that; but she would tell him that she could not obey him in aught
else. "Tell me that it shall be so," he had said to her with his sweet, imperious, manly words. But,
had been before which did no fist, do he own one attribute Hugo would besides said the beginning
took down of existent nothing. Hugo was not the himself when they there was realize by wishes from

That was not well have some realist nothing. There was balzac jugular

   That flagship like noddle; and did they would be returned. So, am you

   was the time; it was poor of i excruciates a randomly been

   sometimes.
 And were I to be your
   wife, your honour and your honesty would force you to be
   good to me. But when you found that I was not as are other
   grand ladies, then I think you would be disappointed. I
   should know it by every line of your dear face, and when I
   saw it there I should be broken-hearted.

   But this is not all. If there were nothing further, I
   think I should give way because I am only a weak girl; and
   your words, my own, own love, would get the better of me.
   But there is another thing. It is hard for me to tell,
   and why should you be troubled with it? But I think if I
   tell it you out and out, so as to make you understand the
   truth, then you will be convinced. Mrs. Roden could tell
   you the same. My dear, dear father could tell you also;
   only that he will not allow himself to believe, because of
   his love for the only child that remains to him. My mother
   died; and all my brothers and sisters have died. And I
   also shall die young.

   Is not that enough? I know that it will be enough. Knowing
   that it will be enough, may I not speak out to you, and
   tell you all my heart? Will you not let me do so, as
   though it had been understood between us, that though we
   can never be more to each other than we are, yet we may
   be allowed to love each other? Oh, my dearest, my only
   dearest, just for this once I have found the words in
   which I may address you. I cannot comfort you as I can
   myself, because you are a man, and cannot find comfort in
   sadness and disappointment, as a girl may do. A man thinks
   that he should win for himself all that he wants. For a
   girl, I think it is sufficient for her to feel that, as
   far as she herself is concerned, that would have been
   given to her which she most desires, had not Fortune been
   unkind. You, dearest, cannot have what you want, because
   you have come to poor Marion Fay with all the glory and
   sweetness of your love. You must suffer for a while. I,
   who would so willingly give my life to serve you, must
   tell you that it will be so. But as you are a man, pluck
   up your heart, and tell yourself that it shall only be for
   a time. The shorter the better, and the stronger you will
   show yourself in overcoming the evil that oppresses you.
   And remember this. Should Marion Fay live to know that you
   had brought a bride home to your house, as it will be your
   duty to do, it will be a comfort to her to feel that the
   evil she has done has been cured.

   MARION.

   I cannot tell you how proud I should be to see your sister
   if she will condescend to come and see me. Or would it not
   be better that I should go over to Hendon Hall? I could
   manage it without trouble. Do not you write about it, but
   ask her to send me one word.

Such was the letter when it was at last finished and despatched. As soon as it was gone,--dropped
irrevocably by her own hand into the pillar letter-box which stood at the corner opposite to
the public-house,--she told her father what she had done. "And why?" he said crossly. "I do
not understand thee. Thou art flighty and fickle, and knowest not thy own mind."

"Yes, father; I have known my own mind always in this matter. It was not fitting."

"If he thinks it fitting, why shouldst thou object?"

"I am not fit, father, to be the wife of a great nobleman. Nor can I trust my own health."
This she said with a courage and firmness which seemed to silence him,--looking at him as though
by her looks she forbade him to urge the matter further. Then she put her arms round him and
kissed him. "Will it not be better, father, that you and I shall remain together till the last?"

"Nothing can be better for me that will not also be best for thee."

"For me it will be best. Father, let it be so, and let this young man be no more thought of
between us." In that she asked more than could be granted to her; but for some days Lord Hampstead's
name was not mentioned between them.

Two days afterwards Lady Frances came to her. "Let me look at you," said Marion, when the other
girl had taken her in her arms and kissed her. "I like to look at you, to see whether you are
like him. To my eyes he is so beautiful."

"More so than I am."

"You are a--lady, and he is a man. But you are like him, and very beautiful. You, too, have
a lover, living close to us?"

"Well, yes. I suppose I must own it."

"Why should you not own it? It is good to be loved and to love. And he has become a great nobleman,--like
your brother."

"No, Marion; he is not that.--May I call you Marion?"

"Why not? He called me Marion almost at once."

"Did he so?"

"Just as though it were a thing of course. But I noticed it. It was not when he bade me poke
the fire, but the next time. Did he tell you about the fire?"

"No, indeed."

"A man does not tell of such things, I think; but a girl remembers them. It is so good of you
to come. You know--do you not?"

"Know what?"

"That I,--and your brother,--have settled everything at last?" The smile of pleasant good humour
passed away from the face of Lady Frances, but at the moment she made no reply. "It is well
that you should know. He knows now, I am sure. After what I said in my letter he will not contradict
me again." Lady Frances shook her head. "I have told him that while I live he of all the world
must be dearest to me. But that will be all."

"Why should you--not live?"

"Lady Frances--"

"Nay, call me Fanny."

"You shall be Fanny if you will let me tell you. Oh! I do so wish that you would understand
it all, and make me tell you nothing further. But you must know,--you must know that it cannot
be as your brother has wished. If it were only less known,--if he would consent and you would
consent,--then I think that I could be happy. What is it after all,--the few years that we
may have to live here? Shall we not meet again, and shall we not love each other then?"

"I hope so."

"If you can really hope it, then why should we not be happy? But how could I hope it if, with
my eyes open, I were to bring a great misfortune upon him? If I did him an evil here, could
I hope that he would love me in Heaven, when he would know all the secrets of my heart? But
if he shall say to himself that I denied myself,--for his sake; that I refused to be taken
into his arms because it would be bad for him, then, though there may be some one dearer, then
shall not I also be dear to him?" The other girl could only cling to her and embrace her. "When
he shall have strong boys round his hearth,--the hearth he spoke of as though it were almost
mine,--and little girls with pink cheeks and bonny brows, and shall know, as he will then,
what I might have done for him, will he not pray for me, and tell me in his prayers that when
we shall meet hereafter I shall still be dear to him? And when she knows it all, she who shall
lie on his breast, shall I not be dear also to her?"

"Oh, my sister!"

"He will tell her. I think he will tell her,--because of his truth, his honour, and his manliness."

Lady Frances, before she left the house, had been made to understand that her brother could
not have his way in the matter which was so near his heart, and that the Quaker's daughter
would certainly have hers.

CHAPTER VI.

"BUT HE IS;--HE IS."

George Roden had come to a decision as to his title, and had told every one concerned that
he meant to be as he always had been,--George Roden, a clerk in the Post Office. When spoken
to, on this side and the other, as to the propriety,--or rather impropriety,--of his decision,
he had smiled for the most part, and had said but little, but had been very confident in himself.
To none of the arguments used against him would he yield in the least. As to his mother's name,
he said, no one had doubted, and no one would doubt it for a moment. His mother's name had
been settled by herself, and she had borne it for a quarter of a century. She had not herself
thought of changing it. For her to blaze out into the world as a Duchess,--it would be contrary
to her feelings, to her taste, and to her comfort! She would have no means of maintaining the
title,--and would be reduced to the necessity of still living in Paradise Row, with the simple
addition of an absurd nickname. As to that, no question had been raised. It was only for him
that she required the new appellation.

As for herself, the whole thing had been settled at once by her own good judgment.

As for himself, he said, the arguments were still stronger against the absurd use of the grand
title. It was imperative on him to earn his bread, and his only means of doing so was by doing
his work as a clerk in the Post Office. Everybody admitted that it would not be becoming that
a Duke should be a clerk in the Post Office. It would be so unbecoming, he declared, that he
doubted whether any man could be found brave enough to go through the world with such a fool's
cap on his head. At any rate he had no such courage. Moreover, no Englishman, as he had been
told, could at his own will and pleasure call himself by a foreign title. It was his pleasure
to be an Englishman. He had always been an Englishman. As an inhabitant of Holloway he had
voted for two Radical members for the Borough of Islington. He would not stultify his own proceedings,
and declare that everything which he had done was wrong. It was thus that he argued the matter;
and, as it seemed, no one could take upon himself to prove that he was an Italian, or to prove
that he was a Duke.

But, though he seemed to be, if not logical, at any rate rational, the world generally did
not agree with him. Wherever he was encountered there seemed to be an opinion that he ought
to assume whatever name and whatever rights belonged to his father. Even at the Post Office
the world was against him.

"I don't quite know why you couldn't do it," said Sir Boreas, when Roden put it to him whether
it would be practicable that a young man calling himself Duca di Crinola should take his place
as a clerk in Mr. Jerningham's room. It may be remembered that Sir Boreas had himself expressed
some difficulty in the matter. He had told Mr. Jerningham that he did not think that they could
get on very well with a real Duke among them. It was thus that the matter had at first struck
him. But he was a brave man, and, when he came to look at it all round, he did not see that
there would be any impossibility. It would be a nine days' wonder, no doubt. But the man would
be there just the same,--the Post Office clerk inside the Duke. The work would be done, and
after a little time even he would become used to having a Duke among his subordinates. As to
whether the Duke were a foreigner or an Englishman,--that, he declared, would not matter in
the least, as far as the Post Office was concerned. "I really don't see why you shouldn't try
it," said Sir Boreas.

"The absurdity would be so great that it would crush me, sir. I shouldn't be worth my salt,"
said Roden.

"That's a kind of thing that wears itself out very quickly. You would feel odd at first,--and
so would the other men, and the messengers. I should feel a little odd when I asked some one
to send the Duca di Crinola to me, for we are not in the habit of sending for Dukes. But there
is nothing that you can't get used to. If your father had been a Prince I don't think I should
break down under it after the first month."

"What good would it do me, Sir Boreas?"

"I think it would do you good. It is difficult to explain the good,--particularly to a man
who is so violently opposed as you to all ideas of rank. But--."

"You mean that I should get promoted quicker because of my title?"

"I think it probable that the Civil Service generally would find itself able to do something
more for a good officer with a high name than for a good officer without one."

"Then, Sir Boreas, the Civil Service ought to be ashamed of itself."

"Perhaps so;--but such would be the fact. Somebody would interfere to prevent the anomaly of
the Duca di Crinola sitting at the same table with Mr. Crocker. I will not dispute it with
you,--whether it ought to be so;--but, if it be probable, there is no reason why you should
not take advantage of your good fortune, if you have capacity and courage enough to act up
to it. Of course what we all want in life is success. If a chance comes in your way I don't
see why you should fling it away." This was the wisdom of Sir Boreas; but Roden would not take
advantage of it. He thanked the great man for his kindness and sympathy, but declined to reconsider
his decision.

In the outer office,--in the room, for instance, in which Mr. Jerningham sat with Crocker and
Bobbin and Geraghty, the feeling was very much stronger in favour of the title, and was expressed
in stronger language. Crocker could not contain himself when he heard that there was a doubt
upon the subject. On Roden's first arrival at the office Crocker almost flung himself into
his friend's arms, with just a single exclamation. "Duca, Duca, Duca!" he had said, and had
then fallen back into his own seat overcome by his emotions. Roden had passed this by without
remark. It was very distasteful to him, and disgusting. He would fain have been able to sit
down at his own desk, and go on with his own work, without any special notice of the occasion,
other than the ordinary greeting occasioned by his return. It was distressing to him that anything
should have been known about his father and his father's title. But that it should be known
was natural. The world had heard of it. The world had put it into the newspapers, and the world
had talked about it. Of course Mr. Jerningham also would talk of it, and the two younger clerks,--and
Crocker. Crocker would of course talk of it louder than any one else. That was to be expected.
A certain amount of misconduct was to be expected from Crocker, and must be forgiven. Therefore
he passed over the ecstatic and almost hysterical repetition of the title which his father
had borne, hoping that Crocker might be overcome by the effort, and be tranquil. But Crocker
was not so easily overcome. He did sit for a moment or two on his seat with his mouth open;
but he was only preparing himself for his great demonstration.

"We are very glad to see you again,--sir," said Mr. Jerningham; not at first quite knowing
how it would become him to address his fellow-clerk.

"Thank you, Mr. Jerningham. I have got back again safe."

"I am sure we are all delighted to hear--what we have heard," said Mr. Jerningham cautiously.

"By George, yes," said Bobbin. "I suppose it's true; isn't it? Such a beautiful name!"

"There are so many things are true, and so many are false, that I don't quite know how to answer
you," said Roden.

"But you are--?" asked Geraghty; and then he stopped, not quite daring to trust himself with
the grand title.

"No;--that's just what I'm not," replied the other.

"But he is," shouted Crocker, jumping from his seat. "He is! He is! It's quite true. He is
Duca di Crinola. Of course we'll call him so, Mr. Jerningham;--eh?"

"I am sure I don't know," said Mr. Jerningham with great caution.

"You'll allow me to know my own name," said Roden.

"No! no!" continued Crocker. "It's all very well for your modesty, but it's a kind of thing
which your friends can't stand. We are quite sure that you're the Duca." There was something
in the Italian title which was peculiarly soothing to Crocker's ears. "A man has to be called
by what he is, not by what he chooses. If the Duke of Middlesex called himself Mr. Smith, he'd
be Duke all the same;--wouldn't he, Mr. Jerningham? All the world would call him Duke. So it
must be with you. I wouldn't call your Grace Mr. ----; you know what I mean, but I won't pronounce
it ever again;--not for ever so much." Roden's brow became very black as he found himself subjected
to the effects of the man's folly. "I call upon the whole office," continued Crocker, "for
the sake of its own honour, to give our dear and highly-esteemed friend his proper name on
all occasions. Here's to the health of the Duca di Crinola!" Just at that moment Crocker's
lunch had been brought in, consisting of bread and cheese and a pint of stout. The pewter pot
was put to his mouth and the toast was drank to the honour and glory of the drinker's noble
friend with no feeling of intended ridicule. It was a grand thing to Crocker to have been brought
into contact with a man possessed of so noble a title. In his heart of hearts he reverenced
"The Duca." He would willingly have stayed there till six or seven o'clock and have done all
the Duca's work for him,--because the Duca was a Duca. He would not have done it satisfactorily,
because it was not in his nature to do any work well, but he would have done it as well as
he did his own. He hated work; but he would have sooner worked all night than see a Duca do
it,--so great was his reverence for the aristocracy generally.

"Mr. Crocker," said Mr. Jerningham severely, "you are making yourself a nuisance. You generally
do."

"A nuisance!"

"Yes; a nuisance. When you see that a gentleman doesn't wish a thing, you oughtn't to do it."

"But when a man's name is his name!"

"Never mind. When he doesn't wish it, you oughtn't to do it!"

"If it's a man's own real name!"

"Never mind," said Mr. Jerningham.

"If it shoots a gintleman to be incognito, why isn't he to do as he plaises?" asked Geraghty.

"If the Duke of Middlesex did call himself Mr. Smith," said Bobbin, "any gentleman that was
a gentleman would fall in with his views." Crocker, not conquered, but for the moment silenced,
seated himself in a dudgeon at his desk. It might do very well for poor fellows, weak creatures
like Jerningham, Bobbin, and Geraghty, thus to be done out of their prey;--but he would not
be cheated in that way. The Duca di Crinola should be Duca di Crinola as far as he, Crocker,
could make his voice heard; and all that heard him should know that the Duca was his own old
peculiar friend.

In Paradise Row the world was decidedly against Roden; and not only were the Demijohns and
Duffers against him, but also his own mother and her friend Mrs. Vincent. On the first Monday
after Mrs. Roden's return Mrs. Vincent came to the Row as usual,--on this occasion to welcome
her cousin, and to hear all the news of the family as it had been at last brought back from
Italy. There was a great deal to be told. Many things had been brought to light which had had
their commencement in Mrs. Vincent's days. There was something of the continuation of a mild
triumph for her in every word that was spoken. She had been against the Di Crinola marriage,
when it had been first discussed more than a quarter of a century ago. She had never believed
in the Duca di Crinola, and her want of faith had been altogether justified. She did not, after
all those years, bear hardly on her friend,--but there was still that well-known tone of gentle
censure and of gentle self-applause. "I told you so," said the elder crow to the younger crow.
When does the old crow cease to remind the younger crow that it was so? "A sad, sad story,"
said Mrs. Vincent, shaking her head.

"All our stories I suppose have much in them that is sad. I have got my son, and no mother
can have more reason to be proud of a son." Mrs. Vincent shook her head. "I say it is so,"
repeated the mother; "and having such a son, I will not admit that it has all been sad."

"I wish he were more ready to perform his religious duties," said Mrs. Vincent.

"We cannot all agree about everything. I do not know that that need be brought up now."

"It is a matter that should be brought up every hour and every day, Mary,--if the bringing
of it up is to do any good."

But it was not on this matter that Mrs. Roden now wished to get assistance from her cousin;--certainly
not with any present view towards the amelioration of her son's religious faith. That might
come afterwards perhaps. But it was her present object to induce her cousin to agree with her,
that her son should permit himself to be called by his father's title. "But you think he should
take his father's name?" she asked. Mrs. Vincent shook her head and tried to look wise. The
question was one on which her feelings were very much divided. It was of course proper that
the son should be called by his father's name. All the proprieties of the world, as known to
Mrs. Vincent, declared that it should be so. She was a woman, too, who by no means despised
rank, and who considered that much reverence was due to those who were privileged to carry
titles. Dukes and lords were certainly very great in her estimation, and even the humblest
knight was respected by her, as having been in some degree lifted above the community by the
will of his Sovereign. And though she was always in some degree hostile to George Roden, because
of the liberties he took in regard to certain religious matters, yet she was good enough and
kind enough to wish well to her own cousin. Had there been a question in regard to an English
title she certainly would not have shaken her head. But as to this outlandish Italian title,
she had her doubts. It did not seem to her to be right that an Englishman should be called
a Duca. If it had been Baron, or even Count, the name would have been less offensive. And then
to her mind hereditary titles, as she had known them, had been recommended by hereditary possessions.
There was something to her almost irreligious in the idea of a Duke without an acre. She could
therefore only again shake her head. "He has as much right to it," continued Mrs. Roden, "as
has the eldest son of the greatest peer in England."

"I dare say he has, my dear, but--."

"But what?"

"I dare say you're right, only--; only it's not just like an English peer, you know."

"The privilege of succession is the same."

"He never could sit in the House of Lords, my dear."

"Of course not. He would assume only what is his own. Why should he be ashamed to take an Italian
title any more than his friend Lord Hampstead is to take an English one? It is not as though
it would prevent his living here. Many foreign noblemen live in England."

"I suppose he could live here," said Mrs. Vincent as though she were making a great admission.
"I don't think that there would be any law to turn him out of the country."

"Nor out of the Post Office, if he chooses to remain there," said Mrs. Roden.

"I don't know how that may be."

"Even if they did, I should prefer that it should be so. According to my thinking, no man should
fling away a privilege that is his own, or should be ashamed of assuming a nobility that belongs
to him. If not for his own sake, he should do it for the sake of his children. He at any rate
has nothing to be ashamed of in the name. It belonged to his father and to his grandfather,
and to his ancestors through many generations. Think how men fight for a title in this country;
how they struggle for it when there is a doubt as to who may properly have inherited it! Here
there is no doubt. Here there need be no struggle." Convinced by the weight of this argument
Mrs. Vincent gave in her adhesion, and at last expressed an opinion that her cousin should
at once call himself by his father's name.

CHAPTER VII.

THE GREAT QUESTION.

Neither were the arguments of Mrs. Roden nor the adhesion of Mrs. Vincent of any power in persuading
George Roden. He answered his mother gently, kindly, but very firmly. Had anything, he said,
been necessary to strengthen his own feeling, it would have been found in his mother's determination
to keep his old name. "Surely, mother, if I may say so without disrespect, what is sauce for
the goose is sauce for the gander." At this the mother smiled, kissing her son to show that
the argument had been taken in good part. "In this matter," he continued, "we certainly are
in a boat together. If I am a Duke you would be a Duchess. If I am doomed to make an ape of
myself at the Post Office, you must be equally ridiculous in Paradise Row,--unless you are
prepared to go back to Italy and live your life there."

"And you?"

"I could not live there. How could I earn my bread there? How could I pass my days so as to
be in any degree useful? What could be more mean? My uncle, though he has been civil, and to
a certain degree generous, would be specially anxious not to see me in public life. You and
I together would have just means enough for existence. I should be doomed to walk about the
streets of some third-rate Italian town, and call myself by my grand name. Would a life like
that satisfy your ambition on my behalf?" Then she thought of the girl who was in love with
him, of the friends whom he had made for himself, of the character which belonged to him, and
she was driven to confess that, by whatever name he might be called, he must continue to live
an Englishman's life, and to live in England. Nevertheless, she told herself that the title
would not be abolished, because it might be in abeyance. She might, she thought, still live
to hear her son called by the name of which she herself had been proud till she had become
thoroughly ashamed of the husband who had given it to her.

But there were others besides Crocker and Mrs. Vincent, and his mother and Sir Boreas, who
were much interested by George Roden's condition. Mrs. Roden returned home on the 2nd of March,
and, as may be remembered, the tidings respecting her son had reached England before she came.
By the end of the month many persons were much exercised as to the young man's future name,
and some people of high rank had not only discussed the subject at great length, but had written
numerous letters concerning it. It was manifest to Lady Persiflage that no further attempt
should now be made to throw obstacles in the way of Lady Frances and her lover. Lady Persiflage
had never believed in the obstacles from the first. "Of course they'll marry," she had said
to her one daughter, who was now almost as good as married herself, and equally trustworthy.
"When a girl is determined like that, of course nothing will stop her. My sister shouldn't
have let her meet the young man at first." But this had been said before the young man had
turned out to be an Italian Duke. Since the news had come Lady Persiflage had been very eager
in recommending her sister to discontinue the opposition. "Make the most of him," she had said
in one of her letters. "It is all that can be done now. It is a fine name, and though Italian
titles do not count like ours, yet, when they are as good as this, they go for a good deal.
There are real records of the Di Crinola family, and there is no manner of doubt but that he
is the head of them. Take him by the hand, and have him down at Trafford if Kingsbury is well
enough. They tell me he is quite presentable, with a good figure and all that;--by no means
a young man who will stand shivering in a room because he doesn't know how to utter a word.
Had he been like that Fanny would never have set her heart upon him. Persiflage has been talking
about him, and he says that something will be sure to turn up if he is brought forward properly,
and is not ashamed of his family name. Persiflage will do whatever he can, but that can only
be if you will open your arms to him." Lady Kingsbury did feel that she was called upon to
undergo a terrible revulsion of sentiment. Opening her arms to the Duca di Crinola might be
possible to her. But how was she to open her arms to Lady Frances Trafford? The man whom she
had seen but once might appear before her with his new title as a young nobleman of whose antecedents
she was not bound to remember anything. She might seem to regard him as a new arrival, a noble
suitor for her stepdaughter's hand, of whom she had not before heard. But how was she to receive
Fanny Trafford, the girl whom she had locked up at Königsgraaf, whose letters she had stopped
as they came from the Post Office? Nevertheless she consented,--as far at least as her sister
was concerned. "I shall never like Fanny," she had said, "because she is so sly." Girls are
always called sly by their friends who want to abuse them. "But of course I will have them
both here, as you think it will be best. What they are to live upon Heaven only knows. But
of course that will be no concern of mine."

As a first result of this Lady Persiflage asked George Roden down to Castle Hautboy for the
Easter holidays. There was a difficulty about this. How was he to be addressed? Hampstead was
consulted, and he, though he was not much in heart just then for the arrangement of such a
matter, advised that for the present his friend's old name should be used. Lady Persiflage
therefore wrote to--George Roden, Esq., at the General Post Office. In this letter it was signified
that Lord Persiflage was very anxious to make the acquaintance of--Mr. Roden. Lady Persiflage
was also very anxious. Lady Persiflage explained that she was aware of,--Well! Lady Frances
Trafford was to be at Castle Hautboy, and that she thought might act as an inducement to--Mr.
Roden. The letter was very cleverly managed.

Though it never once mentioned the grand title it made allusions which implied that the real
rank of the Post Office clerk was well known to every one at Castle Hautboy. And though nothing
of course was said as to any possible relations between Lord Persiflage as a member of the
British Cabinet and the clerk's uncle as a member of the Italian Cabinet, nevertheless as to
this also there were allusions which were intelligible. This letter was altogether very gracious,--such
a one as few young men would be able to resist coming from such a person as Lady Persiflage.
But the special offer which prevailed with our Post Office clerk was no doubt the promise of
the presence of Fanny Trafford. In all the rest, gracious as the words were, there was nothing
but trouble for him. It was clear enough to him that Lady Persiflage was on the same side as
Crocker. And he could see also that the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs was on the same
side. The Secretary of State would not have expressed a special desire to see him, the Post
Office clerk, at Castle Hautboy, and have, as it were, welcomed him to the possession of his
brother-in-law's daughter, had nothing been told of the Duca di Crinola. He heard as much from
Lord Hampstead, who advised him to go to Castle Hautboy, and make himself acquainted with Fanny's
family friends. It was all manifest. And as it was all being done in opposition to his own
firm resolution, he would not have gone,--but that the temptation was too great for him. Fanny
Trafford would be there,--and he was quite open to the charm of the offer which was almost
being made to him of Lady Fanny's hand. He arranged the matter at the office, and wrote to
Lady Persiflage accepting the invitation.

"So you're going to Castle Hautboy?" said Crocker to him. Crocker was in torments at the time.
He had been made to understand that he would be doing quite wrong in calling the Duca "Your
Grace." Roden, if a Duke at all, could be only an Italian Duke--and not on that account "Your
Grace." This had been explained by Bobbin, and had disturbed him. The title "Duca" was still
open to him; but he feared Roden's wrath if he should use it too freely.

"How do you know?" asked Roden.

"I have been there myself, you know;--and am in the habit of hearing from Castle Hautboy."
His father was agent on the property, and of course he heard tidings, if not from his father,
at any rate from his sisters.

"Yes; I am going to Castle Hautboy."

"Hampstead will be there probably. I met Hampstead there. A man in Lord Persiflage's position
will, of course, be delighted to welcome the--the--Duca di Crinola." He shrank as though he
feared that Roden would strike him--but he uttered the words.

"Of course, if you choose to annoy me, I cannot well help myself," said Roden as he left the room.

On his first arrival at the Castle things were allowed to go quietly with him. Every one called
him "Mr. Roden." Lady Persiflage received him very graciously. Lady Frances was in the house,
and her name was mentioned to him with the whispered intimacy which on such occasions indicates
the triumph of the man's position. She made no allusion either to his rank or to his office,
but treated him just as she might have done any other suitor,--which was exactly what he wanted.
Lord Llwddythlw had come down for his Easter holidays of two days, and was very civil to him.
Lady Amaldina was delighted to make his acquaintance, and within three minutes was calling
upon him to promise that he would not get himself married before August in consideration for
her bevy. "If I was to lose Fanny now," she said, "I really think I should give it up altogether."
Then before dinner he was allowed to find himself alone with Fanny, and for the first time
in his life felt that his engagement was an acknowledged thing.

All this was made very pleasant to him by the occasional use of his proper name. He had been
almost ashamed of himself because of the embarrassment which his supposed title had occasioned
him. He felt that he had thought of the matter more than it was worth. The annoyances of Crocker
had been abominable to him. It was not likely that he should encounter a second Crocker, but
still he dreaded he hardly knew what. It certainly was not probable that these people at Castle
Hautboy should call him by a name he had never used without consulting him. But still he had
dreaded something, and was gratified that the trouble seemed to pass by him easily. Lady Persiflage
and Lady Amaldina had both used his legitimate name, and Lord Llwddythlw had called him nothing
at all. If he could only be allowed to go away just as he had come, without an allusion from
any one to the Di Crinola family, then he should think that the people at Castle Hautboy were
very well-bred. But he feared that this was almost too much to hope. He did not see Lord Persiflage
till a moment before dinner, when he specially remarked that he was introduced as Mr. Roden.
"Very glad to see you, Mr. Roden. I hope you're fond of scenery. We're supposed to have the
finest view in England from the top of the tower. I have no doubt my daughter will show it
you. I can't say that I ever saw it myself. Beautiful scenery is all very well when you are
travelling, but nobody ever cares for it at home." Thus Lord Persiflage had done his courtesy
to the stranger, and the conversation became general, as though the stranger were a stranger
no longer. When Roden found that he was allowed to give his arm to Lady Frances, and go out
and eat his dinner quietly and comfortably without any reference to the peculiarity of his
position, he thought that perhaps no further troubles were in store for him.

The whole of the next day was devoted to the charms of love and scenery. The spring weather
was delightful, and Roden was allowed to ramble about where he pleased with Lady Frances. Every
one about the place regarded him as an accepted and recognized lover. As he had never been
in truth accepted by one of the family except by the girl herself;--as the Marquis had not
condescended even to see him when he had come, but had sent Mr. Greenwood to reject him scornfully;
as the Marchioness had treated him as below contempt; as even his own friend Lord Hampstead
had declared that the difficulties would be insuperable, this sudden cessation of all impediments
did seem to be delightfully miraculous. Assent on the part of Lord and Lady Persiflage would,
he understood, be quite as serviceable as that of Lord and Lady Kingsbury. Something had occurred
which, in the eyes of all the family, had lifted him up as it were out of the gutter and placed
him on a grand pedestal. There could be no doubt as to this something. It was all done because
he was supposed to be an Italian nobleman. And yet he was not an Italian nobleman; nor would
he allow any one to call him so, as far as it might be in his power to prevent it.

His visit was limited to two entire days. One was passed amidst all the sweets of love-making.
With the pleasures of that no allusions were allowed to interfere. On the following morning
he found himself alone with Lord Persiflage after breakfast. "Delighted to have had you down
here, you know," began his lordship. To this Roden simply bowed. "I haven't the pleasure of
knowing your uncle personally, but there isn't a man in Europe for whom I have a higher respect."
Again Roden bowed. "I've heard all about this romance of yours from D'Ossi. You know D'Ossi?"
Roden declared that he had not the honour of knowing the Italian Minister. "Ah; well, you must
know D'Ossi, of course. I won't say whether he's your countryman or not, but you must know
him. He is your uncle's particular friend."

"It's only by accident that I know my uncle, or even learnt that he was my uncle."

"Just so. But the accident has taken place, and the result fortunately remains. Of course you
must take your own name."

"I shall keep the name I have, Lord Persiflage."

"You will find it to be quite impossible. The Queen will not allow it." Upon hearing this Roden
opened his eyes; but the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs looked him full in the face
as though to assure him that, though he had never heard of such a thing before, such, in fact,
was the truth. "Of course there will be difficulties. I'm not prepared at the present moment
to advise how this should be done. Perhaps you had better wait till Her Majesty has signified
her pleasure to receive you as the Duca di Crinola. When she has done so you will have no alternative."

"No alternative as to what I may call myself?"

"None in the least, I should say. I am thinking now in a great measure as to the welfare of
my own relative, Lady Frances. Something will have to be done. I don't quite see my way as
yet; but something, no doubt, will be done. The Duca di Crinola will, I have no doubt, find
fitting employment." Then a little bell was rung, and Vivian, the private secretary, came into
the room. Vivian and Roden knew each other, and a few pleasant words were spoken; but Roden
found himself obliged to take his departure without making any further protests in regard to
Her Majesty's assumed wishes.

About five o'clock that evening he was invited into a little sitting-room belonging to Lady
Persiflage up-stairs. "Haven't I been very good to you?" she said, laughing.

"Very good, indeed. Nothing could be so good as inviting me down here to Castle Hautboy."

"That was done for Fanny's sake. But have I said one word to you about your terrible name?"

"No, indeed; and now, Lady Persiflage, pray go on and be good to the end."

"Yes," she said, "I will be good to the end,--before all the people down-stairs. I haven't
said a word of it even to Fanny. Fanny is an angel."

"According to my thinking."

"That's of course. But even an angel likes to have her proper rank. You mustn't allow yourself
to suppose that even Fanny Trafford is indifferent to titles. There are things that a man may
expect a girl to do for him, but there are things which cannot be expected, let her be ever
so much in love. Fanny Trafford has got to become Duchess of Crinola."

"I am afraid that that is more than I can do for her."

"My dear Mr. Roden, it must be done. I cannot let you go away from here without making you
understand that, as a man engaged to be married, you cannot drop your title. Did you intend
to remain single, I cannot say how far your peculiar notions might enable you to prevail; but
as you mean to marry, she, too, will have rights. I put it to you whether it would be honest
on your part to ask her to abandon the rank which she will be entitled to expect from you.
Just you think of it, Mr. Roden. And now I won't trouble you any more upon the subject."

Not a word more was said on the subject at Castle Hautboy, and on the next day he returned
to the Post Office.

CHAPTER VIII.

"I CANNOT COMPEL HER."

About the middle of April Lord and Lady Kingsbury came up to London. From day to day and week
to week he had declared that he would never again be able to move out of his room; and had
gone on making up his mind to die immediately, till people around him began to think that he
was not going to die at all. He was, however, at last persuaded that he might at any rate as
well die in London as at Trafford, and, therefore, allowed himself to be carried up to Park
Lane. The condition of his own health was, of course, given to him for the reason of this movement.
At this peculiar period of the year, it would be better for him, they said, to be near his
London doctor. No doubt the Marquis believed that it was so. When a man is ill nothing is so
important to him as his own illness. But it may be a question whether the anxiety felt by the
Marchioness as to other affairs of the family generally had not an effect with her in inducing
her to persuade her husband. The Marquis had given a modified assent to his daughter's marriage;
and she, in a manner still more modified, had withdrawn her opposition. Permission had been
given to Fanny to marry the Duca di Crinola. This had been given without any reference to money,
but had certainly implied a promise of a certain amount of income from the bride's father.
How else would it be possible that they should live? The letter had been written to Lady Frances
by her stepmother at the dictation of the Marquis. But the words absolutely dictated had not
perhaps been religiously followed. The father had intended to be soft and affectionate, merely
expressing his gratification that his girl's lover should turn out to be the Duca di Crinola.
Out of this the Marchioness had made a stipulation. The lover should be received as a lover,
on condition that he bore the name and title. Lady Persiflage had told her sister that as a
matter of course the name would be taken. "A man always takes his father's name as a matter
of course," Lady Persiflage had said. She believed that the man's absurd notions would be overcome
by continual social pressure. Whether the social pressure would or would not prevail, the man
would certainly marry the girl. There could, therefore, be no better course than that of trusting
to social pressure. Lady Persiflage was quite clear as to her course. But the Marchioness,
though yielding to her sister in much, still thought that a bargain should be made. It had
been suggested that she should invite "the young man" down to Trafford. Roden was usually called
"the young man" at present in these family conclaves. She had thought that it would be better
to see him up in London. Lady Frances would come to them in Park Lane, and then the young man
should be invited. The Marchioness would send her compliments to the "Duca di Crinola." Nothing
on earth should induce her to write the name of Roden,--unless it might happily come to pass
that the engagement should be broken.

Hampstead at this time was still living at Hendon. His sister remained with him till the Marchioness
came up to town about the middle of April, but no one else except George Roden saw much of
him. Since Roden's return from Italy his visits to Hendon Hall had been tacitly permitted.
The Kingsbury and Persiflage world had taken upon itself to presume that the young man was
the Duca di Crinola, and, so presuming, had in truth withdrawn all impediments. Lady Frances
had written to her father in answer to the letter which had reached her from the Marchioness
in his name, and had declared that Mr. Roden was Mr. Roden, and would remain Mr. Roden. She
had explained his reasons at great length, but had probably made them anything but intelligible
to her father. He, however, had simply concealed the letter when he had half-read it. He would
not incur the further trouble of explaining this to his wife, and had allowed the matter to
go on, although the stipulation made was absolutely repudiated by the parties who were to have
been bound by it.

For Roden and Lady Frances this was no doubt very pleasant. Even Lady Amaldina Hauteville with
her bevy was not more thoroughly engaged to her aristocratic lover than was Lady Frances to
this precarious Italian nobleman. But the brother in these days was by no means as happy as
his sister. There had been a terrible scene between him and Lady Frances after his return from
Trafford. He came back with Marion's letter in his pocket,--with every word contained in it
clear in his memory; but still, still doubting as to the necessity of obeying Marion's orders.
She had declared, with whatever force of words she had known how to use, that the marriage
which he proposed to himself was impossible. She had told him so more than once before, and
the telling had availed nothing. Her first assertion that she could not become his wife had
hardly served to moderate in the least the joy which he had felt from the assurances of her
affections. It had meant nothing to him. When she had spoken to him simply of their differences
of rank he had thrown the arguments under his feet, and had trampled upon them with his masterful
imperious determination. His whole life and energy were devoted to the crushing of arguments
used towards him by those who were daily telling him that he was severed from other men by
the peculiarities of his rank. He certainly would not be severed from this one woman whom he
loved by any such peculiarity. Fortifying his heart by these reflections, he had declared to
himself that the timid doubtings of the girl should go for nothing. As she loved him he would
of course be strong enough to conquer all such doubtings. He would take her up in his arms
and carry her away, and simply tell her that she had got to do it. He had a conviction that
a girl when once she had confessed that she loved a man, belonged to the man, and was bound
to obey him. To watch over her, to worship her, to hover round her, so that no wind should
be allowed to blow too strongly on her, to teach her that she was the one treasure in the world
that could be of real value to him,--but at the same time to make a property of her, so that
she should be altogether his own,--that had been his idea of the bond which should unite him
and Marion Fay together. As she took a joy in his love it could not be but that she would come
to his call at last.

She too had perceived something of this,--so much, that it had become necessary to her to tell
him the whole truth. Those minor reasons, though even they should have been strong enough,
were not, she found, powerful with him. She tried it, and acknowledged to herself that she
failed. The man was too wilful for her guidance,--too strong for the arguments by which she
had hoped to control him. Then it had been necessary to tell him all the truth. This she had
done at last with very few words. "My mother died; and all my brothers and sisters have died.
And I also shall die young." Very simple, this had been; but, ah, powerful as it was simple!
In it there had been a hard assertion of facts too strong even for his masterful nature. He
could not say, even to himself, that it was not so,--that it should not be so. It might be
that she might be spared where others had not been spared. That risk, of course, he was prepared
to run. Without turning it much in his thoughts, without venturing to think of the results
or to make a calculation, he was prepared to tell her that she too must leave all that in the
hand of God, and run her chance as do all human mortal beings. He certainly would so argue
the matter with her. But he could not tell her that there was no ground for fear. He could
not say that though her mother had died, and though her little brothers and sisters had died,
there was yet no cause for fear. And he felt that should she persist in her resolution there
would be a potency about her which it might well be that he should fail to dominate. If we
can live, let us live together; and if we must die, let us die,--as nearly together as may
be. That we should come together is the one thing absolutely essential; and then let us make
our way through our troubles as best we may under the hands of Fate. This was what he would
now say to her. But he knew that he could not say it with that bright look and those imperious
tones which had heretofore almost prevailed with her. Not replying to Marion's letter by any
written answer, but resolving that the words which would be necessary might best be spoken,
he came back to Hendon. Oh how softly they should be spoken! With his arm round her waist he
would tell her that still it should be for better or for worse. "I will say nothing of what
may happen except this;--that whatever may befall us we will take it and bear it together."
With such words whispered into her ear, would he endeavour to make her understand that though
it might all be true, still would her duty be the same.

But when he reached his house, intending to go on almost at once to Holloway, he was stopped
by a note from the Quaker.

"My dear young friend," said the note from the Quaker,

   I am desired by Marion to tell thee that we have thought
   it better that she should go for a few weeks to the
   seaside. I have taken her to Pegwell Bay, whence I can
   run up daily to my work in the City. After that thou last
   saw her she was somewhat unwell,--not ill, indeed, but
   flurried, as was natural, by the interview. And I have
   taken her down to the seaside in compliance with medical
   advice. She bids me, however, to tell thee that there
   is no cause for alarm. It will, however, be better, for
   a time at least, that she should not be called upon to
   encounter the excitement of meeting thee.

   Thy very faithful friend,

   ZACHARY FAY.

This made him nervous, and for the moment almost wretched. It was his desire at first to rush
off to Pegwell Bay and learn for himself what might be the truth of her condition. But on consideration
he felt that he did not dare to do so in opposition to the Quaker's injunction. His arrival
there among the strangers of the little watering-place would of course flurry her. He was obliged
to abandon that idea, and content himself with a resolve to see the Quaker in the City on the
next morning. But the words spoken to him afterwards by his sister were heavier to bear than
the Quaker's letter. "Dear John," she had said, "you must give it up."

"I will never give it up," he had answered. And as he spoke there came across his brows an
angry look of determination.

"Dear John!"

"What right have you to tell me to give it up? What would you say to me if I were to declare
that George Roden should be given up?"

"If there were the same cause!"

"What do you know of any cause?"

"Dear, dearest brother."

"You are taking a part against me. You can be obstinate. I am not more likely to give a thing
up than you are yourself."

"It is her health."

"Is she the first young woman that was ever married without being as strong as a milkmaid?
Why should you take upon yourself to condemn her?"

"It is not I. It is Marion herself. You told me to go to her, and of course she spoke to me."

He paused a moment, and then in a hoarse, low voice asked a question. "What did she say to
you when you spoke to her?"

"Oh, John!--I doubt I can hardly tell you what she said. But you know what she said. Did she
not write and tell you that because of her health it cannot be as you would have it."

"And would you have me yield, because for my sake she is afraid? If George Roden were not strong
would you throw him over and go away?"

"It is a hard matter to discuss, John."

"But it has to be discussed. It has at any rate to be thought of. I don't think that a woman
has a right to take the matter into her own hands, and say that as a certainty God Almighty
has condemned her to an early death. These things must be left to Providence, or Chance, or
Fate, as you may call it."

"But if she has her own convictions--?"

"She must not be left to her own convictions. It is just that. She must not be allowed to sacrifice
herself to a fantastic idea."

"You will never prevail with her," said his sister, taking him by the arm, and looking up piteously
into his face.

"I shall not prevail? Do you say that certainly I shall not prevail?" She was still holding
his arm, and still looking up into his face, and now she answered him by slightly shaking her
head. "Why should you speak so positively?"

"She could say things to me which she could hardly say to you."

"What was it then?"

"She could say things to me which I can hardly repeat to you. Oh, John, believe me,--believe
me. It must be abandoned. Marion Fay will never be your wife." He shook himself free from her
hand, and frowned sternly at her. "Do you think I would not have her for my sister, if it were
possible? Do you not believe that I too can love her? Who can help loving her?"

He knew, of course, that as the shoe pinched him it could not pinch her. What were any other
love or any other sadness as compared to his love or to his sadness? It was to him as though
the sun were suddenly taken out of his heaven, as though the light of day were destroyed for
ever from before his eyes,--or rather as though a threat were being made that the sun should
be taken from his heaven and the light from his eyes,--a threat under which it might be necessary
that he should succumb. "Marion, Marion, Marion," he said to himself again and again, walking
up and down between the lodge and the hall door. Whether well or ill, whether living or dying,
she surely must be his! "Marion!" And then he was ashamed of himself, as he felt rather than
heard that he had absolutely shouted her name aloud.

On the following day he was with the Quaker in London, walking up and down Old Broad Street
in front of the entrance leading up to Pogson and Littlebird's. "My dear friend," said the
Quaker, "I do not say that it shall never be so. It is in the hands of the Almighty." Hampstead
shook his head impatiently. "You do not doubt the power of the Almighty to watch over His creatures?"

"I think that if a man wants a thing he must work for it."

The Quaker looked him hard in the face. "In the ordinary needs of life, my young lord, the
maxim is a good one."

"It is good for everything. You tell me of the Almighty. Will the Almighty give me the girl
I love if I sit still and hold my peace? Must I not work for that as for anything else?"

"What can I do, Lord Hampstead?"

"Agree with me that it will be better for her to run her chance. Say as I do that it cannot
be right that she should condemn herself. If you,--you her father,--will bid her, then she
will do it."

"I do not know."

"You can try with her;--if you think it right. You are her father."

"Yes,--I am her father."

"And she is obedient to you. You do not think that she should--? Eh?"

"How am I to say? What am I to say else than that it is in God's hands? I am an old man who
have suffered much. All have been taken from me;--all but she. How can I think of thy trouble
when my own is so heavy?"

"It is of her that we should think."

"I cannot comfort her; I cannot control her. I will not even attempt to persuade her. She is
all that I have. If I did think for a moment that I should like to see my child become the
wife of one so high as thou art, that folly has been crushed out of me. To have my child alive
would be enough for me now, let alone titles, and high places, and noble palaces."

"Who has thought of them?"

"I did. Not she,--my angel; my white one!" Hampstead shook his head and clenched his fist,
shaking it, in utter disregard of the passers by, as the hot, fast tears streamed down his
face. Could it be necessary that her name should be mentioned even in connection with feelings
such as those which the Quaker owned.

"Thou and I, my lord," continued Zachary Fay, "are in sore trouble about this maiden. I believe
that thy love is, as mine, true, honest, and thorough. For her sake I wish I could give her
to thee,--because of thy truth and honesty; not because of thy wealth and titles. But she is
not mine to give. She is her own,--and will bestow her hand or refuse to do so as her own sense
of what is best for thee may direct her. I will say no word to persuade her one way or the
other." So speaking the Quaker strode quickly up the gateway, and Lord Hampstead was left to
make his way back out of the City as best he might.

CHAPTER IX.

IN PARK LANE.

On Monday, the 20th of April, Lady Frances returned to her father's roof. The winter had certainly
not been a happy time for her. Early in the autumn she had been taken off to the German castle
in great disgrace because of her plebeian lover, and had, ever since, been living under so
dark a cloud, as to have been considered unfit for the companionship of those little darlings,
the young lords, her half-brothers. She had had her way no doubt, never having for a moment
wavered in her constancy to the Post Office clerk; but she had been assured incessantly by
all her friends that her marriage with the man was impossible, and had no doubt suffered under
the conviction that her friends were hostile to her. Now she might be happy. Now she was to
be taken back to her father's house. Now she was to keep her lover, and not be held to have
been disgraced at all. No doubt in this there was great triumph.

But her triumph had been due altogether to an accident;--to what her father graciously called
a romance, while her stepmother described it less civilly as a "marvellous coincidence, for
which she ought to thank her stars on her bended knees." The accident,--or coincidence or romance
as it might be called,--was, of course, her lover's title. Of this she was by no means proud,
and would not at all thank her stars for it on her bended knees. Though she was happy in her
lover's presence, her happiness was clouded by the feeling that she was imposing upon her father.
She had been allowed to ask her lover to dine at Kingsbury House because her lover was supposed
to be the Duca di Crinola. But the invitation had been sent under an envelope addressed to
George Roden, Esq., General Post Office. No one had yet ventured to inscribe the Duke's name
and title on the back of a letter. The Marchioness was assured by her sister that it would
all come right, and had, therefore, submitted to have the young man asked to come and eat his
dinner under the same roof with her darlings. But she did not quite trust her sister, and felt
that after all it might become her imperative duty to gather her children together in her bosom,
and fly with them from contact with the Post Office clerk,--the Post Office clerk who would
not become a Duke. The Marquis himself was only anxious that everything should be made to be
easy. He had, while at Trafford, been so tormented by Mr. Greenwood and his wife that he longed
for nothing so much as a reconciliation with his daughter. He was told on very good authority,--on
the authority of no less a person than the Secretary of State,--that this young man was the
Duca di Crinola. There had been a romance, a very interesting romance; but the fact remained.
The Post Office clerk was no longer George Roden, and would, he was assured, soon cease to
be a Post Office clerk. The young man was in truth an Italian nobleman of the highest order,
and as such was entitled to marry the daughter of an English nobleman. If it should turn out
that he had been misinformed, that would not be his fault.

So it was when George Roden came to dine at Kingsbury House. He himself at this moment was
not altogether happy. The last words which Lady Persiflage had said to him at Castle Hautboy
had disturbed him. "Would it be honest on your part," Lady Persiflage had asked him, "to ask
her to abandon the rank which she will be entitled to expect from you?" He had not put the
matter to himself in that light before. Lady Frances was entitled to as much consideration
in the matter as was himself. The rank would be as much hers as his. And yet he couldn't do
it. Not even for her sake could he walk into the Post Office and call himself the Duca di Crinola.
Not even for her sake could he consent to live an idle, useless life as an Italian nobleman.
Love was very strong with him, but with it there was a sense of duty and manliness which would
make it impossible for him to submit himself to such thraldom. In doing it he would have to
throw over all the strong convictions of his life. And yet he was about to sit as a guest at
Lord Kingsbury's table, because Lord Kingsbury would believe him to be an Italian nobleman.
He was not, therefore, altogether happy when he knocked at the Marquis's door.

Hampstead had refused to join the party. He was not at present in a condition to join any social
gathering. But, omitting him, a family party had been collected. Lord and Lady Persiflage were
there, with Lady Amaldina and her betrothed. The Persiflages had taken the matter up very strongly,
so that they may have been said to have become George Roden's special patrons or protectors.
Lord Persiflage, who was seldom much in earnest about anything, had determined that the Duca
di Crinola should be recognized, and was supposed already to have spoken a word on the subject
in a very high quarter indeed. Vivian, the Private Secretary, was there. The poor Marquis himself
was considered unable to come down into the dining-room, but did receive his proposed son-in-law
up-stairs. They had not met since the unfortunate visit made by the Post Office clerk to Hendon
Hall, when no one had as yet dreamed of his iniquity; nor had the Marchioness seen him since
the terrible sound of that feminine Christian name had wounded her ears. The other persons
assembled had in a measure become intimate with him. Lord Llwddythlw had walked round Castle
Hautboy and discussed with him the statistics of telegraphy. Lady Amaldina had been confidential
with him as to her own wedding. Both Lord and Lady Persiflage had given him in a very friendly
manner their ideas as to his name and position. Vivian and he had become intimate personal
friends. They could, all of them, accept him with open arms when he was shown into the drawing-room,
except Lady Kingsbury herself. "No; I am not very well just at present," said the Marquis from
his recumbent position as he languidly stretched out his hand. "You won't see me down at dinner.
God knows whether anybody will ever see me down at dinner again."

"Not see you down at dinner!" said Lord Persiflage. "In another month you will be talking treason
in Pall Mall as you have done all your life."

"I wish you had made Hampstead come with you, Mr.--" But the Marquis stopped himself, having
been instructed that he was not on any account to call the young man Mr. Roden. "He was here
this morning, but seemed to be in great trouble about something. He ought to come and take
his place at the bottom of the table, seeing how ill I am;--but he won't."

Lady Kingsbury waited until her husband had done his grumbling before she attempted the disagreeable
task which was before her. It was very disagreeable. She was a bad hypocrite. There are women
who have a special gift of hiding their dislikings from the objects of them, when occasion
requires. They can smile and be soft, with bitter enmity in their hearts, to suit the circumstances
of the moment. And as they do so, their faces will overcome their hearts, and their enmity
will give way to their smiles. They will become almost friendly because they look friendly.
They will cease to hate because hatred is no longer convenient. But the Marchioness was too
rigid and too sincere for this. She could command neither her features nor her feelings. It
was evident from the moment the young man entered the room, that she would be unable to greet
him even with common courtesy. She hated him, and she had told every one there that she hated
him. "How do you do?" she said, just touching his hand as soon as he was released from her
husband's couch. She, too, had been specially warned by her sister that she must not call the
young man by any name. If she could have addressed him by his title, her manner might perhaps
have been less austere.

"I am much obliged to you by allowing me to come here," said Roden, looking her full in the
face, and making his little speech in such a manner as to be audible to all the room. It was
as though he had declared aloud his intention of accepting this permission as conveying much
more than a mere invitation to dinner. Her face became harder and more austere than ever. Then
finding that she had nothing more to say to him she seated herself and held her peace.

Only that Lady Persiflage was very unlike her sister, the moment would have been awkward for
them all. Poor Fanny, who was sitting with her hand within her father's, could not find a word
to say on the occasion. Lord Persiflage, turning round upon his heel, made a grimace to his
Private Secretary. Llwddythlw would willingly have said something pleasant on the occasion
had he been sufficiently ready. As it was he stood still, with his hands in his trousers pockets
and his eyes fixed on the wall opposite. According to his idea the Marchioness was misbehaving
herself. "Dear Aunt Clara," said Lady Amaldina, trying to say something that might dissipate
the horror of the moment, "have you heard that old Sir Gregory Tollbar is to marry Letitia
Tarbarrel at last?" But it was Lady Persiflage who really came to the rescue. "Of course we're
all very glad to see you," she said. "You'll find that if you'll be nice to us, we'll all be
as nice as possible to you. Won't we, Lord Llwddythlw?"

"As far as I am concerned," said the busy Member of Parliament, "I shall be delighted to make
the acquaintance of Mr. Roden." A slight frown, a shade of regret, passed over the face of
Lady Persiflage as she heard the name. A darker and bitterer cloud settled itself on Lady Kingsbury's
brow. Lord Kingsbury rolled himself uneasily on his couch. Lady Amaldina slightly pinched her
lover's arm. Lord Persiflage was almost heard to whistle. Vivian tried to look as if it didn't
signify. "I am very much obliged to you for your courtesy, Lord Llwddythlw," said George Roden.
To have called him by his name was the greatest favour that could have been done to him at
that moment. Then the door was opened and dinner announced.

"Time and the hour run through the roughest day." In this way that dinner at Kingsbury House
did come to an end at last. There was a weight of ill-humour about Lady Kingsbury on this special
occasion against which even Lady Persiflage found it impossible to prevail. Roden, whose courage
rose to the occasion, did make a gallant effort to talk to Lady Frances, who sat next to him.
But the circumstances were hard upon him. Everybody else in the room was closely connected
with everybody else. Had he been graciously accepted by the mistress of the house, he could
have fallen readily enough into the intimacies which would then have been opened to him. But
as it was he was forced to struggle against the stream, and so to struggle as to seem not to
struggle. At last, however, time and the hour had done its work, and the ladies went up to
the drawing-room.

"Lord Llwddythlw called him Mr. Roden!" This was said by the Marchioness in a tone of bitter
reproach as soon as the drawing-room door was closed.

"I was so sorry," said Lady Amaldina.

"It does not signify in the least," said Lady Persiflage. "It cannot be expected that a man
should drop his old name and take a new one all in a moment."

"He will never drop his old name and take the new one," said Lady Frances.

"There now," said the Marchioness. "What do you think of that, Geraldine?"

"My dear Fanny," said Lady Persiflage, without a touch of ill-nature in her tone, "how can
you tell what a young man will do?"

"I don't think it right to deceive Mamma," said Fanny. "I know him well enough to be quite
sure that he will not take the title, as he has no property to support it. He has talked it
over with me again and again, and I agree with him altogether."

"Upon my word, Fanny, I didn't think that you would be so foolish," said her aunt. "This is
a kind of thing in which a girl should not interfere at all. It must be arranged between the
young man's uncle in Italy, and--and the proper authorities here. It must depend very much
upon--." Here Lady Persiflage reduced her words to the very lowest whisper. "Your uncle has
told me all about it, and of course he must know better than any one else. It's a kind of thing
that must be settled for a man by,--by--by those who know how to settle it. A man can't be
this or that just as he pleases."

"Of course not," said Lady Amaldina.

"A man has to take the name, my dear, which he inherits. I could not call myself Mrs. Jones
any more than Mrs. Jones can call herself Lady Persiflage. If he is the Duca di Crinola he
must be the Duca di Crinola."

"But he won't be Duca di Crinola," said Lady Frances.

"There now!" said the Marchioness.

"If you will only let the matter be settled by those who understand it, and not talk about
it just at present, it would be so much better."

 "She promised
it me,--for a purpose."

"A purpose!"

"For a purpose, my lord."

"What purpose?" Mr. Greenwood went on staring and shaking his head and rubbing his hands, till
the Marquis, awestruck and almost frightened, put out his hand towards the bell. But he thought
of it again. He remembered himself that he had nothing to fear. If the man had anything to
say about the Marchioness it might perhaps be better said without the presence of servants.
"If you mean to say anything, say it. If not,--go. If you do neither one nor the other very
quickly, I shall have you turned out of the house."

"Turned out of the house?"

"Certainly. If you have any threat to make, you had better make it in writing. You can write
to my lawyers, or to me, or to Lord Hampstead, or to Mr. Roberts."

"It isn't a threat. It is only a statement. She promised it me,--for a purpose."

"I don't know what you mean by a purpose, Mr. Greenwood. I don't believe Lady Kingsbury made
any such promise; but if she did it wasn't hers to promise. I don't believe it; but had she
promised I should not be bound by it."

"Not if you have not given it away?"

"I have given it away, Mr. Greenwood."

"Then I must suggest--"

"Suggest what!"

"Compensation, my lord. It will only be fair. You ask her ladyship. Her ladyship cannot intend
that I should be turned out of your lordship's house with only two hundred a year, after what
has passed between me and her ladyship."

"What passed?" said the Marquis, absolutely rousing himself so as to stand erect before the
other man.

"I had rather, my lord, you should hear it from her ladyship."

"What passed?"

"There was all that about Lady Frances."

"What about Lady Frances?"

"Of course I was employed to do all that I could to prevent the marriage. You employed me yourself,
my lord. It was you sent me down to see the young man, and explain to him how impertinent he
was. It isn't my fault, Lord Kingsbury, if things have got themselves changed since then."

"You think you ought to make a demand upon me because as my Chaplain you were asked to see
a gentleman who called here on a delicate matter?"

"It isn't that I am thinking about. If it had been only that I should have said nothing. You
asked me what it was about, and I was obliged to remind you of one thing. What took place between
me and her ladyship was, of course, much more particular; but it all began with your lordship.
If you hadn't commissioned me I don't suppose her ladyship would ever have spoken to me about
Lady Frances."

"What is it all? Sit down;--won't you?--and tell it all like a man if you have got anything
to tell." The Marquis, fatigued with his exertion, was forced to go back to his chair. Mr.
Greenwood also sat down,--but whether or no like a man may be doubted. "Remember this, Mr.
Greenwood, it does not become a gentleman to repeat what has been said to him in confidence,--especially
not to repeat it to him or to them from whom it was intended to be kept secret. And it does
not become a Christian to endeavour to make ill-blood between a husband and his wife. Now,
if you have got anything to say, say it." Mr. Greenwood shook his head. "If you have got nothing
to say, go away. I tell you fairly that I don't want to have you here. You have begun something
like a threat, and if you choose to go on with it, you may. I am not afraid to hear you, but
you must say it or go."

Mr. Greenwood again shook his head. "I suppose you won't deny that her ladyship honoured me
with a very close confidence."

"I don't know anything about it."

"Your lordship didn't know that her ladyship down at Trafford used to be talking to me pretty
freely about Lord Hampstead and Lady Frances?"

"If you have got anything to say, say it," screamed the Marquis.

"Of course his lordship and her ladyship are not her ladyship's own children."

"What has that got to do with it?"

"Of course there was a bitterness."

"What is that to you? I will hear nothing from you about Lady Kingsbury, unless you have to
tell me of some claim to be made upon her. If there has been money promised you, and she acknowledges
it, it shall be paid. Has there been any such promise?"

Mr. Greenwood found it very difficult,--nay, quite impossible,--to say in accurate language
that which he was desirous of explaining by dark hints. There had, he thought, been something
of a compact between himself and the Marchioness. The Marchioness had desired something which
she ought not to have desired, and had called upon the Chaplain for more than his sympathy.
The Chaplain had been willing to give her more than his sympathy,--had at one time been almost
willing to give her very much more. He might possibly, as he now felt, have misinterpreted
her wishes. But he had certainly heard from her language so strong, in reference to her husband's
children, that he had been justified in considering that it was intended to be secret. As a
consequence of this he had been compelled to choose between the Marquis and the Marchioness.
By becoming the confidential friend of the one he had necessarily become the enemy of the other.
Then, as a further consequence, he was turned out of the house,--and, as he declared to himself,
utterly ruined. Now in this there had certainly been much hardship, and who was to compensate
him if not the Marquis?

There certainly had been some talk about Appleslocombe during those moments of hot passion
in which Lady Kingsbury had allowed herself to say such evil things of Lady Frances and Lord
Hampstead. Whether any absolute promise had been given she would probably not now remember.
There certainly had been a moment in which she had thought that her husband's life might possibly
pass away before that of the old rector; and reference may have been made to the fact that
had her own darling been the heir, the gift of the living would then have fallen into her own
hands. Mr. Greenwood had probably thought more of some possible compensation for the living
than of the living itself. He had no doubt endeavoured to frighten her ladyship into thinking
that some mysterious debt was due to him, if not for services actually rendered, at any rate
for extraordinary confidences. But before he had forced upon her the acknowledgment of the
debt, he was turned out of the house! Now this he felt to be hard.

What were two hundred a-year as a pension for a gentleman after such a life-long service? Was
it to be endured that he should have listened for so many years to all the abominable politics
of the Marquis, and to the anger and disappointment of the Marchioness, that he should have
been so closely connected, and for so many years, with luxury, wealth, and rank, and then arrive
at so poor an evening of his day? As he thought of this he felt the more ashamed of his misfortune,
because he believed himself to be in all respects a stronger man than the Marquis. He had flattered
himself that he could lead the Marquis, and had thought that he had been fairly successful
in doing so. His life had been idle, luxurious, and full of comfort. The Marquis had allowed
him to do pretty well what he pleased until in an evil hour he had taken the side of the Marchioness
in a family quarrel. Then the Marquis, though weak in health,--almost to his death,--had suddenly
become strong in purpose, and had turned him abruptly out of the house with a miserable stipend
hardly fit for more than a butler! Could it be that he should put up with such usage, and allow
the Marquis to escape unscathed out of his hand?

In this condition of mind, he had determined that he owed it to himself to do or say something
that should frighten his lordship into a more generous final arrangement. There had been, he
said to himself again and again, such a confidence with a lady of so high a rank, that the
owner of it ought not to be allowed to languish upon two or even upon three hundred a-year.
If the whole thing could really be explained to the Marquis, the Marquis would probably see
it himself. And to all this was to be added the fact that no harm had been done. The Marchioness
owed him very much for having wished to assist her in getting rid of an heir that was disagreeable
to her. The Marquis owed him more for not having done it. And they both owed him very much
in that he had never said a word of it all to anybody else. He had thought that he might be
clever enough to make the Marquis understand something of this without actually explaining
it. That some mysterious promise had been made, and that, as the promise could not be kept,
some compensation should be awarded,--this was what he had desired to bring home to the mind
of the Marquis. He had betrayed no confidence. He intended to betray none. He was very anxious
that the Marquis should be aware, that as he, Mr. Greenwood, was a gentleman, all confidences
would be safe in his hands; but then the Marquis ought to do his part of the business, and
not turn his confidential Chaplain out of the house after a quarter of a century with a beggarly
annuity of two hundred a-year!

But the Marquis seemed to have acquired unusual strength of character; and Mr. Greenwood found
that words were very difficult to be found. When he talk to all titles his illustrations were prophesy
from seas and nets. When among lost inhabitant it is the coin being heard in hearer was contained
of news who brush the floor and activity did a depression. When the ways with my caravans and
better sure governor occupy him do it likes the price. Yet is cannery come down to degree, at to

When he am surrounded to means with Hampstead Daemon was the soil or the Bishop. While composing

asked to tower but him wrote the technicalities of the reach that

"And you think that nothing should be done for me?"

"I think that nothing should be done for you more than has been done."

"Very well. I am not going to tell secrets that have been intrusted to me as a gentleman, even
though I am so badly used by those who have confided them to me. Her ladyship is safe with
me. Because I sympathized with her ladyship your lordship turned me out of the house."

"No; I didn't."

"Should I have been treated like this had I not taken her ladyship's part? I am too noble to
betray a secret, or, no doubt, I could compel your lordship to behave to me in a very different
manner. Yes, my lord, I am quite ready to go now. I have made my appeal, and I have made it
in vain. I have no wish to call upon her ladyship. As a gentleman I am bound to give her ladyship
no unnecessary trouble."

While this last speech was going on a servant had come into the room, and had told the Marquis
that the "Duca di Crinola" was desirous of seeing him. The servants in the establishment were
of course anxious to recognize Lady Frances' lover as an Italian Duke. The Marquis would probably
have made some excuse for not receiving the lover at this moment, had he not felt that he might
in this way best insure the immediate retreat of Mr. Greenwood. Mr. Greenwood went, and Roden
was summoned to Lord Kingsbury's presence; but the meeting took place under circumstances which
naturally made the Marquis incapable of entering at the moment with much spirit on the great
"Duca" question.

CHAPTER XII.

LORD HAMPSTEAD AGAIN WITH MRS. RODEN.

Weeks had passed by since Lord Hampstead had walked up and down Broad Street with Mr. Fay,--weeks
which were to him a period of terrible woe. His passion for Marion had so seized upon him,
that it had in all respects changed his life. The sorrow of her alleged ill-health had fallen
upon him before the hunting had been over, but from that moment he had altogether forgotten
his horses. The time had now come in which he was wont to be on board his yacht, but of his
yacht he took no notice whatever. "I can tell you nothing about it as yet," he said in the
only line which he wrote to his skipper in answer to piteous applications made to him. None
of those who were near and dear to him knew how he passed his time. His sister left him and
went up to the house in London, and he felt that her going was a relief to him. He would not
even admit his friend Roden to come to him in his trouble. He spent his days all alone at Hendon,
occasionally going across to Holloway in order that he might talk of his sorrow to Mrs. Roden.
Midsummer had come upon him before he again saw the Quaker. Marion's father had left a feeling
almost of hostility in his mind in consequence of that conversation in Broad Street. "I no
longer want anything on your behalf," the Quaker had seemed to say. "I care nothing now for
your name, or your happiness. I am anxious only for my child, and as I am told that it will
be better that you should not see her, you must stay away." That the father should be anxious
for his daughter was natural enough. Lord Hampstead could not quarrel with Zachary Fay. But
he taught himself to think that their interests were at variance with each other. As for Marion,
whether she were ill or whether she were well, he would have had her altogether to himself.

Gradually there had come upon him the conviction that there was a real barrier existing between
himself and the thing that he desired. To Marion's own words, while they had been spoken only
to himself, he had given no absolute credit. He had been able to declare to her that her fears
were vain, and that whether she were weak or whether she were strong, it was her duty to come
to him. When they two had been together his arguments and assurances had convinced at any rate
himself. The love which he had seen in her eyes and had heard from her lips had been so sweet
to him, that their savour had overcome whatever strength her words possessed. But these protestations,
these assurances that no marriage could be possible, when they reached him second-hand, as
they had done through his sister and through the Quaker, almost crushed him. He did not dare
to tell them that he would fain marry the girl though she were dying,--that he would accept
any chance or no chance, if he might only be allowed to hold her in his arms, and tell her
that she was all his own. There had come a blow, he would say to himself, again and again,
as he walked about the grounds at Hendon, there had come a blow, a fatal blow, a blow from
which there could be no recovery,--but, still, it should, it ought, to be borne together. He
would not admit to himself that because of this verdict there ought to be a separation between
them two. It might be that the verdict had been uttered by a Judge against whom there could
be no appeal; but even the Judge should not be allowed to say that Marion Fay was not his own.
Let her come and die in his arms if she must die. Let her come and have what of life there
might be left to her, warmed and comforted and perhaps extended by his love. It seemed to him
to be certainly a fact, that because of his great love, and of hers, she did already belong
to him; and yet he was told that he might not see her;--that it would be better that she should
not be disturbed by his presence,--as though he were no more than a stranger to her. Every
day he almost resolved to disregard them, and go down to the little cottage in which she was
living. But then he remembered the warnings which were given to him, and was aware that he
had in truth no right to intrude upon the Quaker's household. It is not to be supposed that
during this time he had no intercourse with Marion. At first there came to be a few lines,
written perhaps once a week from her, in answer to many lines written by him; but by degrees
the feeling of awe which at first attached itself to the act of writing to him wore off, and
she did not let a day pass without sending him some little record of herself and her doings.
It had come to be quite understood by the Quaker that Marion was to do exactly as she pleased
with her lover. No one dreamed of hinting to her that this correspondence was improper or injurious.
Had she herself expressed a wish to see him, neither would the Quaker nor Mrs. Roden have made
strong objection. To whatever might have been her wish or her decision they would have acceded.
It was by her word that the marriage had been declared to be impossible. It was in obedience
to her that he was to keep aloof. She had failed to prevail with her own soft words, and had
therefore been driven to use the authority of others.

But at this period, though she did become weaker and weaker from day to day, and though the
doctor's attendance was constant at the cottage, Marion herself was hardly unhappy. She grieved
indeed for his grief; but, only for that, there would have been triumph and joy to her rather
than grief. The daily writing of these little notes was a privilege to her and a happiness,
of which she had hitherto known nothing. To have a lover, and such a lover, was a delight to
her, a delight to which there was now hardly any drawback, as there was nothing now of which
she need be afraid. To have him with her as other girls may have their lovers, she knew was
impossible to her. But to read his words, and to write loving words to him, to talk to him
of his future life, and bid him think of her, his poor Marion, without allowing his great manly
heart to be filled too full with vain memories, was in truth happiness to her. "Why should
you want to come?" she said. "It is infinitely better that you should not come. We understand
it all now, and acknowledge what it is that the Lord has done for us. It would not have been
good for me to be your wife. It would not have been good for you to have become my husband.
But it will I think be good for me to have loved you; and if you will learn to think of it
as I do, it will not have been bad for you. It has given a beauty to my life," she said, "which
makes me feel that I ought to be contented to die early. If I could have had a choice I would
have chosen it so."

But these teachings from her had no effect whatever upon him. It was her idea that she would
pass away, and that there would remain with him no more than a fair sweet shade which would
have but little effect upon his future life beyond that of creating for him occasionally a
gentle melancholy. It could not be, she thought, that for a man such as he,--for one so powerful
and so great,--such a memory should cause a lasting sorrow. But with him, to his thinking,
to his feeling, the lasting biting sorrow was there already. There could be no other love,
no other marriage, no other Marion. He had heard that his stepmother was anxious for her boy.
The way should be open for the child. It did seem to him that a life, long continued, would
be impossible to him when Marion should have been taken away from him.

"Oh yes;--he's there again," said Miss Demijohn to her aunt. "He comes mostly on Tuesdays,
Thursdays, and Saturdays. What he can be coming about is more than I can guess. Crocker says
it's all true love. Crocker says that the Duca says--"

"Bother the Duca," exclaimed the old woman. "I don't believe that Crocker and George Roden
ever exchange a word together."

"Why shouldn't they exchange words, and they fast friends of five years' standing? Crocker
says as Lord Hampstead is to be at Lady Amaldina's wedding in August. His lordship has promised.
And Crocker thinks--"

"I don't believe very much about Crocker, my young woman. You had better look to yourself,
or, perhaps, you'll find when you have got yourself married that Crocker has not got a roof
to cover you."

Lord Hampstead had walked over to Paradise Row, and was seated with Mrs. Roden when this little
squabble was going on. "You don't think that I ought to let things remain as they are," he
said to Mrs. Roden. To all such questions Mrs. Roden found it very difficult to make any reply.
She did in truth think that they ought to be allowed to remain as they were,--or rather that
some severance should be made more decided even than that which now existed. Putting aside
her own ideas, she was quite sure that Marion would not consent to a marriage. And, as it was
so, and must be so, it was better, she thought, that the young people should see no more of
each other. This writing of daily letters,--what good could it do to either of them? To her
indeed, to Marion, with her fixed purpose, and settled religious convictions, and almost certain
fate, little evil might be done. But to Lord Hampstead the result would be, and was, terribly
pernicious. He was sacrificing himself, not only as Mrs. Roden thought for the present moment,
but for many years perhaps,--perhaps for his future life,--to a hopeless passion. A cloud was
falling upon him which might too probably darken his whole career. From the day on which she
had unfortunately taken Marion to Hendon Hall, she had never ceased to regret the acquaintance
which she had caused. To her thinking the whole affair had been unfortunate. Between people
so divided there should have been no intimacy, and yet this intimacy had been due to her. "It
is impossible that I should not see her," continued Lord Hampstead. "I will see her."

"If you would see her, and then make up your mind to part with her,--that I think would be good."

"To see her, and say farewell to her for ever?"

"Yes, my lord."

"Certainly not. That I will never do. If it should come to pass that she must go from me for
ever, I would have her in my arms to the very last!"

"At such a moment, my lord, those whom nature has given to her for her friends--"

"Has not nature given me too for her friend? Can any friend love her more truly than I do?
Those should be with us when we die to whom our life is of most importance. Is there any one
to whom her life can be half as much as it is to me? The husband is the dearest to his wife.
When I look upon her as going from me for ever, then may I not say that she is the same to
me as my wife."

"Why--why,--why?"

"I know what you mean, Mrs. Roden. What is the use of asking 'why' when the thing is done?
Could I make it so now, as though I had never seen her? Could I if I would? Would I if I could?
What is the good of thinking of antecedents which are impossible? She has become my treasure.
Whether past and fleeting, or likely to last me for my life, she is my treasure. Can I make
a change because you ask why,--and why,--and why? Why did I ever come here? Why did I know
your son? Why have I got a something here within me which kills me when I think that I shall
be separated from her, and yet crowns me with glory when I feel that she has loved me. If she
must leave me, I have to bear it. What I shall do, where I shall go, whether I shall stand
or fall, I do not pretend to say. A man does not know, himself, of what stuff he is made, till
he has been tried. But whatever may be my lot, it cannot be altered by any care or custody
now. She is my own, and I will not be separated from her. If she were dead, I should know that
she was gone. She would have left me, and I could not help myself. As yet she is living, and
may live, and I will be with her. I must go to her there, or she must come here to me. If he
will permit it I will take some home for myself close to hers. What will it matter now, though
every one should know it? Let them all know it. Should she live she will become mine. If she
must go,--what will the world know but that I have lost her who was to have been my wife?"

Even Mrs. Roden had not the heart to tell him that he had seen Marion for the last time. It
would have been useless to tell him so, for he would not have obeyed the behest contained in
such an assertion. Ideas of prudence and ideas of health had restrained him hitherto,--but
he had been restrained only for a time. No one had dared suggest to him that he should never
again see his Marion. "I suppose that we must ask Mr. Fay," she replied. She was herself more
powerful than the Quaker, as she was well aware; but it had become necessary to her to say
something.

"Mr. Fay has less to say to it even than I have," said Hampstead. "My belief is that Marion
herself is the only one among us who is strong. If it were not that she is determined, he would
yield and you would yield."

"Who can know as she knows?" said Mrs. Roden. "Which among us is so likely to be guided by
what is right? Which is so pure, and honest, and loving? Her conscience tells her what is best."

"I am not sure of that," said he. "Her conscience may fill her as well as another with fears
that are unnecessary. I cannot think that a girl should be encouraged by those around her to
doom herself after this fashion. Who has a right to say that God has determined that she shall
die early?" Mrs. Roden shook her head. "I am not going to teach others what religion demands,
but to me it seems that we should leave these things in God's hands. That she may doubt as
to herself may be natural enough, but others should not have encouraged her."

"You mean me, my lord?"

"You must not be angry with me, Mrs. Roden. The matter to me is so vital that I have to say
what I think about it. It does seem to me that I am kept away from her, whereas, by all the
ties which can bind a man and a woman together, I ought to be with her. Forms and ceremonies
seem to sink to nothing, when I think of all she is to me, and remember that I am told that
she is soon to be taken away from me."

"How would it be if she had a mother?"

"Why should her mother refuse my love for her daughter? But she has no mother. She has a father
who has accepted me. I do believe that had the matter been left wholly to him, Marion would
now be my wife."

"I was away, my lord, in Italy."

"I will not be so harsh to such a friend as you, as to say that I wish you had remained there;
but I feel,--I cannot but feel--"

"My lord, I think the truth is that you hardly know how strong in such a matter as this our
Marion herself can be. Neither have I nor has her father prevailed upon her. I can go back
now, and tell you without breach of confidence all that passed between her and me. When first
your name was discussed between us; when first I saw that you seemed to make much of her--"

"Make much of her!" exclaimed Hampstead, angrily.

"Yes; make much of her! When first I thought that you were becoming fond of her."

"You speak as though there had been some idle dallying. Did I not worship her? Did I not pour
out my whole heart into her lap from the first moment in which I saw her? Did I hide it even
from you? Was there any pretence, any falsehood?"

"No, indeed."

"Do not say that I made much of her. The phrase is vile. When she told me that she loved me,
she made much of me."

"When first you showed us that you loved her," she continued, "I feared that it would not be
for good."

"Why should it not be for good?"

"I will not speak of that now, but I thought so. I thought so, and I told my thoughts to Marion."

"You did?"

"I did;--and I think that in doing so, I did no more than my duty to a motherless girl. Of
the reasons which I gave to her I will say nothing now. Her reasons were so much stronger,
that mine were altogether unavailing. Her resolutions were built on so firm a rock, that they
needed no persuasions of mine to strengthen them. I had ever known Marion to be pure, unselfish,
and almost perfect. But I had never before seen how high she could rise, how certainly she
could soar above all weakness and temptation. To her there was never a moment of doubt. She
knew from the very first that it could not be so."

"It shall be so," he said, jumping up from his chair, and flinging up his arms.

"It was not I who persuaded her, or her father. Even you cannot persuade her. Having convinced
herself that were she to marry you, she would injure you, not all her own passionate love will
induce her to accept the infinite delight of yielding to you. What may be best for you;--that
is present to her mind, and nothing else. On that her heart is fixed, and so clear is her judgment
respecting it, that she will not allow the words of any other to operate on her for a moment.
Marion Fay, Lord Hampstead, is infinitely too great to have been persuaded in any degree by me."

      *      *      *      *      *      *

Nevertheless Mrs. Roden did allow herself to say that in her opinion the lover should be allowed
to see his mistress. She herself would go to Pegwell Bay, and endeavour to bring Marion back
to Holloway. That Lord Hampstead should himself go down and spend his long hours at the little
seaside place did not seem to her to be fitting. But she promised that she would do her best
to arrange at any rate another meeting in Paradise Row.

CHAPTER XIII.

LORD HAMPSTEAD AGAIN WITH MARION.

The Quaker had become as weak as water in his daughter's hands. To whatever she might have
desired he would have given his assent. He went daily up from Pegwell Bay to Pogson and Littlebird's,
but even then he was an altered man. It had been said there for a few days that his daughter
was to become the wife of the eldest son of the Marquis of Kingsbury, and then it had been
said that there could be no such marriage--because of Marion's health. The glory while it lasted
he had borne meekly, but with a certain anxious satisfaction. The pride of his life had been
in Marion, and this young lord's choice had justified his pride. But the glory had been very
fleeting. And now it was understood through all Pogson and Littlebird's that their senior clerk
had been crushed, not by the loss of his noble son-in-law, but by the cause which produced
the loss. Under these circumstances poor Zachary Fay had hardly any will of his own, except
to do that which his daughter suggested to him. When she told him that she would wish to go
up to London for a few days, he assented as a matter of course. And when she explained that
she wished to do so in order that she might see Lord Hampstead, he only shook his head sadly,
and was silent.

"Of course I will come as you wish it," Marion had said in her letter to her lover. "What would
I not do that you wish,--except when you wish things that you know you ought not? Mrs. Roden
says that I am to go up to be lectured. You mustn't be very hard upon me. I don't think you
ought to ask me to do things which you know,--which you know that I cannot do. Oh, my lover!
oh, my love! would that it were all over, and that you were free!"

In answer to this, and to other letters of the kind, he wrote to her long argumentative epistles,
in which he strove to repress the assurances of his love, in order that he might convince her
the better by the strength of his reasoning. He spoke to her of the will of God, and of the
wickedness of which she would be guilty if she took upon herself to foretell the doings of
Providence. He said much of the actual bond by which they had tied themselves together in declaring
their mutual love. He endeavoured to explain to her that she could not be justified in settling
such a question for herself without reference to the opinion of those who must know the world
better than she did. Had the words of a short ceremony been spoken, she would have been bound
to obey him as her husband. Was she not equally bound now, already, to acknowledge his superiority,--and
if not by him, was it not her manifest duty to be guided by her father? Then at the end of
four carefully-written, well-stuffed pages, there would come two or three words of burning
love. "My Marion, my self, my very heart!" It need hardly be said that as the well-stuffed
pages went for nothing with Marion,--had not the least effect towards convincing her, so were
the few words the very food on which she lived. There was no absurdity in the language of love
that was not to her a gem so brilliant that it deserved to be garnered in the very treasure
house of her memory! All those long useless sermons were preserved because they had been made
rich and rare by the expression of his passion.

She understood him, and valued him at the proper rate, and measured him correctly in everything.
He was so true, she knew him to be so true, that even his superlatives could not be other than
true! But as for his reasoning, she knew that that came also from his passion. She could not
argue the matter out with him, but he was wrong in it all. She was not bound to listen to any
other voice but that of her own conscience. She was bound not to subject him to the sorrows
which would attend him were he to become her husband. She could not tell how weak or how strong
might be his nature in bearing the burden of the grief which would certainly fall upon him
at her death. She had heard, and had in part seen, that time does always mitigate the weight
of that burden. Perhaps it might be best that she should go at once, so that no prolonged period
of his future career should be injured by his waiting. She had begun to think that he would
be unable to look for another wife while she lived. By degrees there came upon her the full
conviction of the steadfastness, nay, of the stubbornness, of his heart. She had been told
that men were not usually like that. When first he had become sweet to her, she had not thought
that he would have been like that. Was it not almost unmanly,--or rather was it not womanly?
And yet he,--strong and masterful as he was,--could he have aught of a woman's weakness about
him? Could she have dreamed that it would be so from the first, she thought that from the very
first she could have abstained.

"Of course I shall be at home on Tuesday at two. Am I not at home every day at all hours? Mrs.
Roden shall not be there as you do not wish it, though Mrs. Roden has always been your friend.
Of course I shall be alone. Papa is always in the City. Good to you! Of course I shall be good
to you! How can I be bad to the one being that I love better than all the world? I am always
thinking of you; but I do wish that you would not think so much of me. A man should not think
so much of a girl,--only just at his spare moments. I did not think that it would be like that
when I told you that you might love me."

All that Tuesday morning, before he left home, he was not only thinking of her, but trying
to marshal in order what arguments he might use,--so as to convince her at last. He did not
at all understand how utterly fruitless his arguments had been with her. When Mrs. Roden had
told him of Marion's strength he had only in part believed her. In all matters concerning the
moment Marion was weak and womanly before him. When he told her that this or the other thing
was proper and becoming, she took it as Gospel because it came from him. There was something
of the old awe even when she looked up into his face. Because he was a great nobleman, and
because she was the Quaker's daughter, there was still, in spite of their perfect love, something
of superiority, something of inferiority of position. It was natural that he should command,--natural
that she should obey. How could it be then that she should not at last obey him in this great
thing which was so necessary to him? And yet hitherto he had never gone near to prevailing
with her. Of course he marshalled all his arguments.

Gentle and timid as she was, she had made up her mind to everything, even down to the very
greeting with which she would receive him. His first warm kiss had shocked her. She had thought
of it since, and had told herself that no harm could come to her from such tokens of affection,--that
it would be unnatural were she to refuse it to him. Let it pass by as an incident that should
mean nothing. To hang upon his neck and to feel and to know that she was his very own,--that
might not be given to her. To hear his words of love and to answer him with words as warm,--that
could be allowed to her. As for the rest, it would be better that she should let it so pass
by that there need be as little of contention as possible on a matter so trivial.

When he came into the room he took her at once, passive and unresisting, into his arms. "Marion,"
he said. "Marion! Do you say that you are ill? You are as bright as a rose."

"Rose leaves soon fall. But we will not talk about that. Why go to such a subject?"

"It cannot be helped." He still held her by the waist, and now again he kissed her. There was
something in her passive submission which made him think at the moment that she had at last
determined to yield to him altogether. "Marion, Marion," he said, still holding her in his
embrace, "you will be persuaded by me? You will be mine now?"

Gradually,--very gently,--she contrived to extricate herself. There must be no more of it,
or his passion would become too strong for her. "Sit down, dearest," she said. "You flurry
me by all this. It is not good that I should be flurried."

"I will be quiet, tame, motionless, if you will only say the one word to me. Make me understand
that we are not to be parted, and I will ask for nothing else."

"Parted! No, I do not think that we shall be parted."

"Say that the day shall come when we may really be joined together; when--"

"No, dear; no; I cannot say that. I cannot alter anything that I have said before. I cannot
make things other than they are. Here we are, we two, loving each other with all our hearts,
and yet it may not be. My dear, dear lord!" She had never even yet learned another name for
him than this. "Sometimes I ask myself whether it has been my fault." She was now sitting,
and he was standing over her, but still holding her by the hand.

"There has been no fault. Why should either have been in fault?"

"When there is so great a misfortune there must generally have been a fault. But I do not think
there has been any here. Do not misunderstand me, dear. The misfortune is not with me. I do
not know that the Lord could have sent me a greater blessing than to have been loved by you,--were
it not that your trouble, your grief, your complainings rob me of my joy."

"Then do not rob me," he said.

"Out of two evils you must choose the least. You have heard of that, have you not?"

"There need be no evil;--no such evil as this." Then he dropped her hand, and stood apart from
her while he listened to her, or else walked up and down the room, throwing at her now and
again a quick angry word, as she went on striving to make clear to him the ideas as they came
to her mind.

"I do not know how I could have done otherwise," she said, "when you would make it so certain
to me that you loved me. I suppose it might have been possible for me to go away, and not to
say a word in answer."

"That is nonsense,--sheer nonsense," he said.

"I could not tell you an untruth. I tried it once, but the words would not come at my bidding.
Had I not spoken them, you would read the truth in my eyes. What then could I have done? And
yet there was not a moment in which I have not known that it must be as it is."

"It need not be; it need not be. It should not be."

"Yes, dear, it must be. As it is so why not let us have the sweet of it as far as it will go?
Can you not take a joy in thinking that you have given an inexpressible brightness to your
poor Marion's days; that you have thrown over her a heavenly light which would be all glorious
to her if she did not see that you were covered by a cloud? If I thought that you could hold
up your head with manly strength, and accept this little gift of my love, just for what it
is worth,--just for what it is worth,--then I think I could be happy to the end."

"What would you have me do? Can a man love and not love?"

"I almost think he can. I almost think that men do. I would not have you not love me. I would
not lose my light and my glory altogether. But I would have your love to be of such a nature
that it should not conquer you. I would have you remember your name and your family--"

"I care nothing for my name. As far as I am concerned, my name is gone."

"Oh, my lord!"

"You have determined that my name shall go no further."

"That is unmanly, Lord Hampstead. Because a poor weak girl such as I am cannot do all that
you wish, are you to throw away your strength and your youth, and all the high hopes which
ought to be before you? Would you say that it were well in another if you heard that he had
thrown up everything, surrendered all his duties, because of his love for some girl infinitely
beneath him in the world's esteem?"

"There is no question of above and beneath. I will not have it. As to that, at any rate we
are on a par."

"A man and a girl can never be on a par. You have a great career, and you declare that it shall
go for nothing because I cannot be your wife."

"Can I help myself if I am broken-hearted? You can help me."

"No, Lord Hampstead; it is there that you are wrong. It is there that you must allow me to
say that I have the clearer knowledge. With an effort on your part the thing may be done."

"What effort? What effort? Can I teach myself to forget that I have ever seen you?"

"No, indeed; you cannot forget. But you may resolve that, remembering me, you should remember
me only for what I am worth. You should not buy your memories at too high a price."

"What is it that you would have me do?"

"I would have you seek another wife."

"Marion!"

"I would have you seek another wife. If not instantly, I would have you instantly resolve to
do so."

"It would not hurt you to feel that I loved another?"

"I think not. I have tried myself, and now I think that it would not hurt me. There was a time
in which I owned to myself that it would be very bitter, and then I told myself, that I hoped,--that
I hoped that you would wait. But now, I have acknowledged to myself the vanity and selfishness
of such a wish. If I really love you am I not bound to want what may be best for you?"

"You think that possible?" he said, standing over her, and looking down upon her. "Judging
from your own heart do you think that you could do that if outward circumstances made it convenient?"

"No, no, no."

"Why should you suppose me to be harder-hearted than yourself, more callous, more like a beast
of the fields?"

"More like a man is what I would have you."

"I have listened to you, Marion, and now you may listen to me. Your distinctions as to men
and women are all vain. There are those, men and women both, who can love and do love, and
there are those who neither do nor can. Whether it be for good or evil,--we can, you and I,
and we do. It would be impossible to think of giving yourself to another?"

"That is certainly true."

"It is the same with me,--and will ever be so. Whether you live or die, I can have no other
wife than Marion Fay. As to that I have a right to expect that you shall believe me. Whether
I have a wife or not you must decide."

"Oh, dearest, do not kill me."

"It has to be so. If you can be firm so can I. As to my name and my family, it matters nothing.
Could I be allowed to look forward and think that you would sit at my hearth, and that some
child that should be my child should lie in your arms, then I could look forward to what you
call a career. Not that he might be the last of a hundred Traffords, not that he might be an
Earl or a Marquis like his forefathers, not that he might some day live to be a wealthy peer,
would I have it so,--but because he would be yours and mine." Now she got up, and threw her
arms around him, and stood leaning on him as he spoke. "I can look forward to that and think
of a career. If that cannot be, the rest of it must provide for itself. There are others who
can look after the Traffords,--and who will do so whether it be necessary or not. To have gone
a little out of the beaten path, to have escaped some of the traditional absurdities, would
have been something to me. To have let the world see how noble a Countess I could find for
it--that would have satisfied me. And I had succeeded. I had found one that would really have
graced the name. If it is not to be so,--why then let the name and family go on in the old
beaten track. I shall not make another venture. I have made my choice, and it is to come to this."

"You must wait, dear;--you must wait. I had not thought it would be like this; but you must wait."

"What God may have in store for me, who can tell. You have told me your mind, Marion; and now
I trust that you will understand mine. I do not accept your decision, but you will accept mine.
Think of it all, and when you see me again in a day or two, then see whether you will not be
able to join your lot to mine and make the best of it." Upon this he kissed her again, and
left her without another word.

CHAPTER XIV.

CROCKER'S DISTRESS.

When Midsummer came Paradise Row was alive with various interests. There was no one there who
did not know something of the sad story of Marion Fay and her love. It was impossible that
such a one as Lord Hampstead should make repeated visits to the street without notice. When
Marion returned home from Pegwell Bay, even the potboy at The Duchess of Edinburgh knew why
she had come, and Clara Demijohn professed to be able to tell all that passed at the interview
next day. Of all the creation, he is not the engagement. His success has he act to he had. His creation,

 Had he chanced to meet her in the High Street on
a Sunday morning, he would have begun with it at once. "Clara," he said, "will you have me?
I know that that other scoundrel is a ruined man."

"Oh, Daniel, you shouldn't hit those as are down."

"Hasn't he been hitting me all the time that I was down? Hasn't he triumphed? Haven't you been
in his arms?"

"Laws; no."

"And wasn't that hitting me when I was down, do you think?"

"It never did you any harm."

"Oh, Clara;--if you knew the nature of my love you'd understand the harm. Every time he has
pressed your lips I have heard it, though I was in King's Head Court all the time."

"That must be a crammer, Daniel."

"I did;--not with the ears of my head, but with the fibres of my breast."

"Oh;--ah. But, Daniel, you and Sam used to be such friends at the first go off."

"Go off of what?"

"When he first took to coming after me. You remember the tea-party, when Marion Fay was here."

"I tried it on just then;--I did. I thought that, maybe, I might come not to care about it
so much."

"I'm sure you acted it very well."

"And I thought that perhaps it might be the best way of touching that cold heart of yours."

"Cold! I don't know as my heart is colder than anybody else's heart."

"Would that you would make it warm once more for me."

"Poor Sam!" said Clara, putting her handkerchief up to her eyes.

"Why is he any poorer than me? I was first. At any rate I was before him."

"I don't know anything about firsts or lasts," said Clara, as the ghosts of various Banquos
flitted before her eyes.

"And as for him, what right has he to think of any girl? He's a poor mean creature, without
the means of getting so much as a bed for a wife to lie on. He used to talk so proud of Her
Majesty's Civil Service. Her Majesty's Civil Service has sent him away packing."

"Not yet, Daniel."

"They have. I've made it my business to find out, and Sir Boreas Bodkin has written the order
to-day. 'Dismissal--B. B.' I know those who have seen the very words written in the punishment
book of the Post Office."

"Poor Sam!"

"Destroying papers of the utmost importance about Her Majesty's Mail Service! What else was
he to expect? And now he's penniless."

"A hundred and twenty isn't so very much, Daniel."

"Mr. Fay was saying only the other day that if I was married and settled they'd make it better
for me."

"You're too fond of The Duchess, Daniel."

"No, Clara--no; I deny that. You ask Mrs. Grimley why it is I come to The Duchess so often.
It isn't for anything that I take there."

"Oh; I didn't know. Young men when they frequent those places generally do take something."

"If I had a little home of my own with the girl I love on the other side of the fireplace,
and perhaps a baby in her arms--" Tribbledale as he said this looked at her with all his eyes.

"Laws, Daniel; what things you do say!"

"I should never go then to any Duchess, or any Marquess of Granby, or to any Angel." These
were public-houses so named, all standing thick together in the neighbourhood of Paradise Row.
"I should not want to go anywhere then,--except where that young woman and that baby were to
be found."

"Daniel, you was always fine at poetry."

"Try me, if it isn't real prose. The proof of the pudding's in the eating. You come and try."
By this time Clara was in his arms, and the re-engagement was as good as made. Crocker was
no doubt dismissed,--or if not dismissed had shown himself to be unworthy. What could be expected
of a husband who could tear up a bundle of Her Majesty's Mail papers? And then Daniel Tribbledale
had exhibited a romantic constancy which certainly deserved to be rewarded. Clara understood
that the gin-and-water had been consumed night after night for her sake. And there were the
lodgings and the clock and the harmonium ready for the occasion. "I suppose it had better be
so, Daniel, as you wish it so much."

"Wish it! I have always wished it. I wouldn't change places now with Mr. Pogson himself."

"He married his third wife three years ago!"

"I mean in regard to the whole box and dice of it. I'd rather have my Clara with £120, than
be Pogson and Littlebird with all the profits." This gratifying assurance was rewarded, and
then, considerably after midnight, the triumphant lover took his leave.

Early on the following afternoon Crocker was in Paradise Row. He had been again with Lord Hampstead,
and had succeeded in worming out of the good-natured nobleman something of the information
contained in the letter from Sir Boreas. The matter was to be left to the Postmaster-General.
Now there was an idea in the office that when a case was left to his lordship, his lordship
never proceeded to extremities. Kings are bound to pardon if they allow themselves to be personally
concerned as to punishment. There was something of the same feeling in regard to official discipline.
As a fact the letter from Sir Boreas had been altogether false. He had known, poor man, that
he must at last take the duty of deciding upon himself, and had used the name of the great
chief simply as a mode of escape for the moment. But Crocker had felt that the mere statement
indicated pardon. The very delay indicated pardon. Relying upon these indications he went to
Paradise Row, dressed in his best frock coat, with gloves in his hand, to declare to his love
that the lodgings need not be abandoned, and that the clock and harmonium might be preserved.

"But you've been dismissed!" said Clara.

"Never! never!"

"It has been written in the book! 'Dismissal--B. B.!' I know the eyes that have seen it."

"That's not the way they do it at all," said Crocker, who was altogether confused.

"It has been written in the book, Sam; and I know that they never go back from that."

"Who wrote it? Nothing has been written. There isn't a book;--not at least like that. Tribbledale
has invented it."

"Oh, Sam, why did you tear those papers;--Her Majesty's Mail papers? What else was there to
expect? 'Dismissal--B. B.;' Why did you do it,--and you engaged to a young woman? No;--don't
come nigh to me. How is a young woman to go and get herself married to a young man, and he
with nothing to support her? It isn't to be thought of. When I heard those words, 'Dismissal--B.
B.,' I thought my very heart would sink within me."

"It's nothing of the kind," said Crocker.

"What's nothing of the kind?"

"I ain't dismissed at all."

"Oh, Sam; how dare you?"

"I tell you I ain't. He's written a letter to Lord Hampstead, who has always been my friend.
Hampstead wasn't going to see me treated after that fashion. Hampstead wrote, and then Æolus
wrote,--that's Sir Boreas,--and I've seen the letter,--that is, Hampstead told me what there
is in it; and I ain't to be dismissed at all. When I heard the good news the first thing I
did was to come as fast as my legs would carry me, and tell the girl of my heart."

Clara did not quite believe him; but then neither had she quite believed Tribbledale, when
he had announced the dismissal with the terrible corroboration of the great man's initials.
But the crime committed seemed to her to be so great that she could not understand that Crocker
should be allowed to remain after the perpetration of it. Crocker's salary was £150; and, balancing
the two young men together as she had often done, though she liked the poetry of Tribbledale,
she did on the whole prefer the swagger and audacity of Crocker. Her Majesty's Civil Service,
too, had its charms for her. The Post Office was altogether superior to Pogson and Littlebird's.
Pogson and Littlebird's hours were 9 to 5. Those of Her Majesty's Service were much more genteel;--10
namely to 4. But what might not a man do who had shown the nature of his disposition by tearing
up official papers? And then, though the accidents of the occasion had enveloped her in difficulties
on both sides, it seemed to her that, at the present moment, the lesser difficulties would
be encountered by adhering to Tribbledale. She could excuse herself with Crocker. Paradise
Row had already declared that the match with Crocker must be broken off. Crocker had indeed
been told that the match was to be broken off. When Tribbledale had come to her overnight she
had felt herself to be a free woman. When she had given way to the voice of the charmer, when
she had sunk into his arms, softened by that domestic picture which he had painted, no pricks
of conscience had disturbed her happiness. Whether the "Dismissal--B. B." had or had not yet
been written, it was sure to come. She was as free to "wed another" as was Venice when her
Doge was deposed. She could throw herself back upon the iniquity of the torn papers were Crocker
to complain. But should she now return to her Crocker, how could she excuse herself with Tribbledale?
"It is all over between you and me, Sam," she said with her handkerchief up to her eyes.

"All over! Why should it be all over?"

"You was told it was all over."

"That was when all the Row said that I was to be dismissed. There was something in it,--then;
though, perhaps, a girl might have waited till a fellow had got up upon his legs again."

"Waiting ain't so pleasant, Mr. Crocker, when a girl has to look after herself."

"But I ain't dismissed at all, and there needn't be any waiting. I thought that you would be
suffering as well as me, and so I came right away to you, all at once."

"So I have suffered, Sam. No one knows what I have suffered."

"But it'll come all right now?" Clara shook her head. "You don't mean that Tribbledale's been
and talked you over already?"

"I knew Mr. Tribbledale before ever I saw you, Sam."

"How often have I heard you call him a poor mean skunk?"

"Never, Crocker; never. Such a word never passed my lips."

"Something very like it then."

"I may have said he wanted sperrit. I may have said so, though I disremember it. But if I did,--what
of that?"

"You despised him."

"No, Crocker. What I despise is a man as goes and tears up Her Majesty's Mail papers. Tribbledale
never tore up anything at Pogson and Littlebird's,--except what was to be tore. Tribbledale
was never turned out for nigh a fortnight, so that he couldn't go and show his face in King's
Head Court. Tribbledale never made hisself hated by everybody." That unknown abominable word
which Crocker had put into her mouth had roused all the woman within her, so that she was enabled
to fight her battle with a courage which would not have come to her aid had he been more prudent.

"Who hates me?"

"Mr. Jerningham does, and Roden, and Sir Boreas, and Bobbin." She had learned all their names.
"How can they help hating a man that tears up the mail papers! And I hate you."

"Clara!"

"I do. What business had you to say I used that nasty word? I never do use them words. I wouldn't
even so much as look at a man who'd demean himself to put such words as them into my mouth.
So I tell you what it is, Mr. Crocker; you may just go away. I am going to become Daniel Tribbledale's
wife, and it isn't becoming in you to stand here talking to a young woman that is engaged to
another young man."

"And this is to be the end of it?"

"If you please, Mr. Crocker."

"Well!"

"If ever you feel inclined to speak your mind to another young woman, and you carry it as far
as we did, and you wishes to hold on to her, don't you go and tear Her Majesty's Mail papers.
And when she tells you a bit of her mind, as I did just now, don't you go and put nasty words
into her mouth. Now, if you please, you may just as well send over that clock and that harmonium
to Daniel Tribbledale, Esq., King's Head Court, Great Broad Street." So saying she left him,
and congratulated herself on having terminated the interview without much unpleasantness.

Crocker, as he shook the dust off his feet upon leaving Paradise Row, began to ask himself
whether he might not upon the whole congratulate himself as to the end to which that piece
of business had been brought. When he had first resolved to offer his hand to the young lady,
he had certainly imagined that that hand would not be empty. Clara was no doubt "a fine girl,"
but not quite so young as she was once. And she had a temper of her own. Matrimony, too, was
often followed by many troubles. Paradise Row would no doubt utter jeers, but he need not go
there to hear them. He was not quite sure but that the tearing of the papers would in the long
run be beneficial to him.

CHAPTER XVI.

PEGWELL BAY.

July had come and nearly gone before Lord Hampstead again saw Marion Fay. He had promised not
to go to Pegwell Bay,--hardly understanding why such a promise had been exacted from him, but
still acceding to it when it had been suggested to him by Mrs. Roden, at the request, as she
said, of the Quaker. It was understood that Marion would soon return to Holloway, and that
on that account the serenity of Pegwell Bay need not be disturbed by the coming of so great
a man as Lord Hampstead. Hampstead had of course ridiculed the reason, but had complied with
the request,--with the promise, however, that Marion should return early in the summer. But
the summer weeks had passed by, and Marion did not return.

Letters passed between them daily in which Marion attempted always to be cheerful. Though she
had as yet invented no familiar name for her noble lover, yet she had grown into familiarity
with him, and was no longer afraid of his nobility. "You oughtn't to stay there," she said,
"wasting your life and doing nothing, because of a sick girl. You've got your yacht, and are
letting all the summer weather go by." In answer to this he wrote to her, saying that he had
sold his yacht. "Could you have gone with me, I would have kept it," he wrote. "Would you go
with me I would have another ready for you, before you would be ready. I will make no assurance
as to my future life. I cannot even guess what may become of me. It may be that I shall come
to live on board some ship so that I may be all alone. But with my heart as it is now I cannot
bear the references which others make to me about empty pleasures." At the same time he sold
his horses, but he said nothing to her as to that.

Gradually he did acknowledge to himself that it was her doom to die early,--almost acknowledged
to himself that she was dying. Nevertheless he still thought that it would have been fit that
they should be married. "If I knew that she were my own even on her deathbed," he once said
to Mrs. Roden, "there would be a comfort to me in it." He was so eager in this that Mrs. Roden
was almost convinced. The Quaker was willing that it should be so,--but willing also that it
should not be so. He would not even try to persuade his girl as to anything. It was his doom
to see her go, and he, having realized that, could not bring himself to use a word in opposition
to her word. But Marion herself was sternly determined against the suggestion. It was unfitting,
she said, and would be wicked. It was not the meaning of marriage. She could not bring herself
to disturb the last thoughts of her life, not only by the empty assumption of a grand name,
but by the sounding of that name in her ears from the eager lips of those around her. "I will
be your love to the end," she said, "your own Marion. But I will not be made a Countess, only
in order that a vain name may be carved over my grave." "God has provided a bitter cup for
your lips, my love," she wrote again, "in having put it into your head to love one whom you
must lose so soon. And mine is bitter because yours is bitter. But we cannot rid ourselves
of the bitterness by pretences. Would it make your heart light to see me dressed up for a bridal
ceremony, knowing, as you would know, that it was all for nothing? My lord, my love, let us
take it as God has provided it. It is only because you grieve that I grieve;--for you and my
poor father. If you could only bring yourself to be reconciled, then it would be so much to
me to have had you to love me in my last moments,--to love me and to be loved."

He could not but accept her decision. Her father and Mrs. Roden accepted it, and he was forced
to do so also. He acknowledged to himself now that there was no appeal from it. Her very weakness
gave her a strength which dominated him. There was an end of all his arguments and his strong
phrases. He was aware that they had been of no service to him,--that her soft words had been
stronger than all his reasonings. But not on that account did he cease to wish that it might
be as he had once wished, since he had first acknowledged to himself his love. "Of course I
will not drive her," he said to Mrs. Roden, when that lady urged upon him the propriety of
abstaining from a renewal of his request. "Had I any power of driving her, as you say, I would
not do so. I think it would be better. That is all. Of course it must be as she shall decide."

"It would be a comfort to her to think that you and she thought alike about all things," said
Mrs. Roden.

"There are points on which I cannot alter my convictions even for her comfort," he answered.
"She bids me love some other woman. Can I comfort her by doing that? She bids me seek another
wife. Can I do that;--or say that I will do it at some future time? It would comfort her to
know that I have no wound,--that I am not lame and sick and sore and weary. It would comfort
her to know that my heart is not broken. How am I to do that for her?"

"No;"--said Mrs. Roden--"no."

"There is no comfort. Her imagination paints for her some future bliss, which shall not be
so far away as to be made dim by distance,--in enjoying which we two shall be together, as
we are here, with our hands free to grasp each other, and our lips free to kiss;--a heaven,
but still a heaven of this world, in which we can hang upon each other's necks and be warm
to each other's hearts. That is to be, to her, the reward of her innocence, and in the ecstacy
of her faith she believes in it, as though it were here. I do think,--I do think,--that if
I told her that it should be so, that I trusted to renew my gaze upon her beauty after a few
short years, then she would be happy entirely. It would be for an eternity, and without the
fear of separation."

"Then why not profess as she does?"

"A lie? As I know her truth when she tells me her creed, so would she know my falsehood, and
the lie would be vain."

"Is there then to be no future world, Lord Hampstead?"

"Who has said so? Certainly not I. I cannot conceive that I shall perish altogether. I do not
think that if, while I am here, I can tame the selfishness of self, I shall reach a step upwards
in that world which shall come next after this. As to happiness, I do not venture to think
much of it. If I can only be somewhat nobler,--somewhat more like the Christ whom we worship,--that
will be enough without happiness. If there be truth in this story, He was not happy. Why should
I look for happiness,--unless it be when the struggle of many worlds shall have altogether
purified my spirit? But thinking like that,--believing like that,--how can I enter into the
sweet Epicurean Paradise which that child has prepared for herself?"

"Is it no better than that?"

"What can be better, what can be purer,--if only it be true? And though it be false to me,
it may be true to her. It is for my sake that she dreams of her Paradise,--that my wounds may
be made whole, that my heart may be cured. Christ's lesson has been so learned by her that
no further learning seems necessary. I fancy sometimes that I can see the platform raised just
one step above the ground on which I stand,--and look into the higher world to which I am ascending.
It may be that it is given to her to look up the one rung of the ladder by mounting which she
shall find herself enveloped in the full glory of perfection."

In conversations such as these Mrs. Roden was confounded by the depth of the man's love. It
became impossible to bid him not be of a broken heart, or even to allude to those fresh hopes
which Time would bring. He spoke to her often of his future life, always speaking of a life
from which Marion would have been withdrawn by death, and did so with a cold, passionless assurance
which showed her that he had almost resolved as to the future. He would see all lands that
were to be seen, and converse with all people. The social condition of God's creatures at large
should be his study. The task would be endless, and, as he said, an endless task hardly admits
of absolute misery. "If I die there will be an end of it. If I live till old age shall have
made me powerless to carry on my work, time will then probably have done something to dim the
feeling." "I think," he said again;--"I feel that could I but remember her as my wife--"

"It is impossible," said Mrs. Roden.

"But if it were so! It would be no more than a thin threadbare cloak over a woman's shivering
shoulders. It is not much against the cold; but it would be very cruel to take that little
from her." She looked at him with her eyes flooded with tears, but she could only shake her
head in sign that it was impossible.

At last, just at the end of July, there came a request that he would go down to Pegwell Bay.
"It is so long since we have seen each other," she wrote, "and, perhaps, it is better that
you should come than that I should go. The doctor is fidgety, and says so. But my darling will
be good to me;--will he not? When I have seen a tear in your eyes it has gone near to crush
me. That a woman, or even a man, should weep at some unexpected tidings of woe is natural.
But who cries for spilt milk? Tell me that God's hand, though it be heavy to you, shall be
borne with reverence and obedience and love."

He did not tell her this, but he resolved that if possible she should see no tears. As for
that cheerfulness, that reconciliation to his fate which she desired, he knew it to be impossible.
He almost brought himself to believe as he travelled down to Pegwell Bay that it would be better
that they should not meet. To thank the Lord for all His mercies was in her mind. To complain
with all the bitterness of his heart of the cruelty with which he was treated was in his. He
had told Mrs. Roden that according to his creed there would be a better world to come for him
if he could succeed in taming the selfishness of self. But he told himself now that the struggle
to do so had hitherto been vain. There had been but the one thing which had ever been to him
supremely desirable. He had gone through the years of his early life forming some Utopian ideas,--dreaming
of some perfection in politics, in philanthropy, in social reform, and the like,--something
by devoting himself to which he could make his life a joy to himself. Then this girl had come
across him, and there had suddenly sprung up within him a love so strong that all these other
things faded into littlenesses. They should not be discarded. Work would be wanted for his
life, and for hers. But here he had found the true salt by which all his work would be vivified
and preserved and made holy and happy and glorious. There had come a something to him that
was all that he wanted it to be. And now the something was fading from him,--was already all
but gone. In such a state how should he tame the selfishness of self? He abandoned the attempt,
and told himself that difficulties had been prepared for him greater than any of which he had
dreamed when he had hoped that that taming might be within his power. He could not even spare
her in his selfishness. He declared to himself that it was so, and almost owned that it would
be better that he should not go to her.

"Yes," she said, when he sat down beside her on her sofa, at an open window looking out on
the little bay, "put your hand on mine, dear, and leave it there. To have you with me, to feel
the little breeze, and to see you and to touch you is absolute happiness."

"Why did you so often tell me not to come?"

"Ah, why? But I know why it was, my lord." There was something half of tenderness, half pleasantry
in the mode of address, and now he had ceased to rebel against it.

"Why should I not come if it be a joy to you?"

"You must not be angry now."

"Certainly not angry."

"We have got through all that,--you and I have for ourselves;--but there is a sort of unseemliness
in your coming down here to see a poor Quaker's daughter."

"Marion!"

"But there is. We had got through all that in Paradise Row. Paradise Row had become used to
you, and I could bear it. But here-- They will all be sure to know who you are."

"Who cares?"

"That Marion Fay should have a lover would of itself make a stir in this little place;--but
that she should have a lord for her lover! One doesn't want to be looked at as a miracle."

"The follies of others should not ruffle you and me."

"That's very well, dear;--but what if one is ruffled? But I won't be ruffled, and you shall
come. When I thought that I should go again to our own house, then I thought we might perhaps
dispense with the ruffling;--that was all."

There was a something in these words which he could not stand,--which he could not bear and
repress that tear which, as she had said, would go near to crush her if she saw it. Had she
not plainly intimated her conviction that she would never again return to her old home? Here,
here in this very spot, the doom was to come, and to come quickly. He got up and walked across
the room, and stood a little behind her, where she could not see his face.

"Do not leave me," she said. "I told you to stay and let your hand rest on mine." Then he returned,
and laying his hand once again upon her lap turned his face away from her. "Bear it," she said.
"Bear it." His hand quivered where it lay as he shook his head. "Call upon your courage and
bear it."

"I cannot bear it," he said, rising suddenly from his chair, and hurrying out of the room.
He went out of the room and from the house, on to the little terrace which ran in front of
the sea. But his escape was of no use to him; he could not leave her. He had come out without
his hat, and he could not stand there in the sun to be stared at. "I am a coward," he said,
going back to her and resuming his chair. "I own it. Let there be no more said about it. When
a trouble comes to me, it conquers me. Little troubles I think I could bear. If it had been
all else in all the world,--if it had been my life before my life was your life, I think that
no one would have seen me blench. But now I find that when I am really tried, I fail."

"It is in God's hands, dearest."

"Yes;--it is in God's hands. There is some power, no doubt, that makes you strong in spirit,
but frail in body; while I am strong to live but weak of heart. But how will that help me?"

"Oh, Lord Hampstead, I do so wish you had never seen me."

"You should not say that, Marion; you shall not think it. I am ungrateful; because, were it
given me to have it all back again, I would not sell what I have had of you, though the possession
has been so limited, for all other imaginable treasures. I will bear it. Oh, my love, I will
bear it. Do not say again that you wish you had not seen me."

"For myself, dear,--for myself--"

"Do not say it for me. I will struggle to make a joy of it, a joy in some degree, though my
heart bleeds at the widowhood that is coming on it. I will build up for myself a memory in
which there shall be much to satisfy me. I shall have been loved by her to have possessed whose
love has been and shall be a glory to me."

"Loved indeed, my darling."

"Though there might have been such a heaven of joy, even that shall be counted as much. It
shall be to me during my future life as though when wandering through the green fields in some
long-past day, I had met a bright angel from another world; and the angel had stopped to speak
to me, and had surrounded me with her glorious wings, and had given me of her heavenly light,
and had spoken to me with the music of the spheres, and I had thought that she would stay with
me for ever. But there had come a noise of the drums and a sound of the trumpets, and she had
flown away from me up to her own abode. To have been so favoured, though it had been but for
an hour, should suffice for a man's life. I will bear it, though it be in solitude."

"No, darling; not in solitude."

"It will be best so for me. The light and the music and the azure of the wings will so remain
with me the purer and the brighter. Oh,--if it had been! But I will bear it. No ear shall again
hear a sound of complaint. Not yours even, my darling, my own, mine for so short a time, but
yet my very own for ever and ever." Then he fell on his knees beside her, and hid his face
in her dress, while the fingers of both her hands rambled through his hair. "You are going,"
he said, when he rose up to his feet, "you are going whither I cannot go."

"You will come; you will come to me."

"You are going now, now soon, and I doubt not that you are going to joys inexpressible. I cannot
go till some chance may take me. If it be given to you in that further world to see those and
to think of those whom you have left below, then, if my heart be true to your heart, keep your
heart true to mine. If I can fancy that, if I can believe that it is so, then shall I have
that angel with me, and though my eyes may not see the tints, my ears will hear the music;--and
though the glory be not palpable as is the light of heaven, there will be an inner glory in
which my soul will be sanctified." After that there were not many words spoken between them,
though he remained there till he was disturbed by the Quaker's coming. Part of the time she
slept with her hand in his, and when awake she was contented to feel his touch as he folded
the scarf close round her neck and straightened the shawl which lay across her feet, and now
and again stroked her hair and put it back behind her ears as it strayed upon her forehead.
Ever and again she would murmur a word or two of love as she revelled in the perception of
his solicitude. What was there for her to regret, for her to whom was given the luxury of such
love? Was not a month of it more than a whole life without it? Then, when the father came,
Hampstead took his leave. As he kissed her lips, something seemed to tell him that it would
be for the last time. It was not good, the Quaker had said, that she should be disturbed. Yes;
he could come again; but not quite yet.

At the very moment when the Quaker so spoke she was pressing her lips to his. "God keep you
and take you, my darling," she whispered to him, "and bring you to me in heaven." She noticed
not at all at the moment the warm tears that were running on to her own face; nor did the Quaker
seem to notice it when Lord Hampstead left the house without saying to him a word of farewell.

CHAPTER XVII.

LADY AMALDINA'S WEDDING.

The time came round for Lady Amaldina's marriage, than which nothing more august, nothing more
aristocratic, nothing more truly savouring of the hymeneal altar, had ever been known or was
ever to be known in the neighbourhood of Hanover Square. For it was at last decided that the
marriage should take place in London before any of the aristocratic assistants at the ceremony
should have been whirled away into autumnal spaces. Lord Llwddythlw himself knew but very little
about it,--except this, that nothing would induce him so to hurry on the ceremony as to interfere
with his Parliamentary duties. A day in August had been mentioned in special reference to Parliament.
He was willing to abide by that, or to go to the sacrifice at any earlier day of which Parliament
would admit. Parliament was to sit for the last time on Wednesday, 12th August, and the marriage
was fixed for the 13th. Lady Amaldina had prayed for the concession of a week. Readers will
not imagine that she based her prayers on the impatience of love. Nor could a week be of much
significance in reference to that protracted and dangerous delay to which the match had certainly
been subjected. But the bevy might escape. How were twenty young ladies to be kept together
in the month of August when all the young men were rushing off to Scotland? Others were not
wedded to their duties as was Lord Llwddythlw. Lady Amaldina knew well how completely Parliament
became a mere affair of Governmental necessities during the first weeks of August. "I should
have thought that just on this one occasion you might have managed it," she said to him, trying
to mingle a tone of love with the sarcasm which at such a crisis was natural to her. He simply
reminded her of the promise which he had made to her in the spring. He thought it best not
to break through arrangements which had been fixed. When she told him of one very slippery
member of the bevy,--slippery, not as to character, but in reference to the movements of her
family,--he suggested that no one would know the difference if only nineteen were to be clustered
round the bride's train. "Don't you know that they must be in pairs?" "Will not nine pairs
suffice?" he asked. "And thus make one of them an enemy for ever by telling her that I wish
to dispense with her services!"

But it was of no use. "Dispense with them altogether," he said, looking her full in the face.
"The twenty will not quarrel with you. My object is to marry you, and I don't care twopence
for the bridesmaids." There was something so near to a compliment in this, that she was obliged
to accept it. And she had, too, begun to perceive that Lord Llwddythlw was a man not easily
made to change his mind. She was quite prepared for this in reference to her future life. A
woman, she thought, might be saved much trouble by having a husband whom she was bound to obey.
But in this matter of her marriage ceremony,--this last affair in which she might be presumed
to act as a free woman,--she did think it hard that she might not be allowed to have her own
way. The bridegroom, however, was firm. If Thursday, the 13th, did not suit her, he would be
quite ready on Thursday, the 20th. "There wouldn't be one of them left in London," said Lady
Amaldina. "What on earth do you think that they are to do with themselves?"

But all the bevy were true to her. Lady Amelia Beaudesert was a difficulty. Her mother insisted
on going to a far-away Bavarian lake on which she had a villa;--but Lady Amelia at the last
moment surrendered the villa rather than break up the bevy, and consented to remain with a
grumpy old aunt in Essex till an opportunity should offer. It may be presumed, therefore, that
it was taken to be a great thing to be one of the bevy. It is, no doubt, a pleasant thing for
a girl to have it asserted in all the newspapers that she is, by acknowledgment, one of the
twenty most beautiful unmarried ladies in Great Britain.

Lady Frances was of course one of the bevy. But there was a member of the family,--a connection
rather,--whom no eloquence could induce to show himself either in the church or at the breakfast.
This was Lord Hampstead. His sister came to him and assured him that he ought to be there.
"Sorrows," she said, "that have declared themselves before the world are held as sufficient
excuse; but a man should not be hindered from his duties by secret grief."

"I make no secret of it. I do not talk about my private affairs. I do not send a town-crier
to Charing Cross to tell the passers-by that I am in trouble. But I care not whether men know
or not that I am unfitted for joining in such festivities. My presence is not wanted for their
marriage."

"It will be odd."

"Let it be odd. I most certainly shall not be there." But he remembered the occasion, and showed
that he did so by sending to the bride the handsomest of all the gems which graced her exhibition
of presents, short of the tremendous set of diamonds which had come from the Duke of Merioneth.

This collection was supposed to be the most gorgeous thing that had ever as yet been arranged
in London. It would certainly not be too much to say that the wealth of precious toys brought
together would, if sold at its cost price, have made an ample fortune for a young newly-married
couple. The families were noble and wealthy, and the richness of the wedding presents was natural.
It might perhaps have been better had not the value of the whole been stated in one of the
newspapers of the day. Who was responsible for the valuation was never known, but it seemed
to indicate that the costliness of the gifts was more thought of than the affection of the
givers; and it was undoubtedly true that, in high circles and among the clubs, the cost of
the collection was much discussed. The diamonds were known to a stone, and Hampstead's rubies
were spoken of almost as freely as though they were being exhibited in public. Lord Llwddythlw
when he heard of all this muttered to his maiden sister a wish that a gnome would come in the
night and run away with everything. He felt himself degraded by the publicity given to his
future wife's ornaments. But the gnome did not come, and the young men from Messrs. Bijou and
Carcanet were allowed to arrange the tables and shelves for the exhibition.

The breakfast was to take place at the Foreign Office, at which the bride's father was for
the time being the chief occupant. Lord Persiflage had not at first been willing that it should
be so, thinking that his own more modest house might suffice for the marriage of his own daughter.
But grander counsels had been allowed to prevail. With whom the idea first arose Lord Persiflage
never knew. It might probably have been with some of the bevy, who had felt that an ordinary
drawing-room would hardly suffice for so magnificent an array of toilets. Perhaps the thought
had first occurred to Messrs. Bijou and Carcanet, who had foreseen the glory of spreading out
all that wealth in the magnificent saloon intended for the welcoming of ambassadors. But it
travelled from Lady Amaldina to her mother, and was passed on from Lady Persiflage to her husband.
"Of course the Ambassadors will all be there," the Countess had said, "and, therefore, it will
be a public occasion." "I wish we could be married at Llanfihangel," Lord Llwddythlw said to
his bride. Now Llanfihangel church was a very small edifice, with a thatched roof, among the
mountains in North Wales, with which Lady Amaldina had been made acquainted when visiting the
Duchess, her future mother-in-law. But Llwddythlw was not to have his way in everything, and
the preparations at the Foreign Office were continued.

The beautifully embossed invitations were sent about among a large circle of noble and aristocratic
friends. All the Ambassadors and all the Ministers, with all their wives and daughters, were,
of course, asked. As the breakfast was to be given in the great Banqueting Hall at the Foreign
Office it was necessary that the guests should be many. It is sometimes well in a matter of
festivals to be saved from extravagance by the modest size of one's rooms. Lord Persiflage
told his wife that his daughter's marriage would ruin him. In answer to this she reminded him
that Llwddythlw had asked for no fortune. Lord Llwddythlw was one of those men who prefer giving
to taking. He had a feeling that a husband should supply all that was wanted, and that a wife
should owe everything to the man she marries. The feeling is uncommon just at present,--except
with the millions who neither have nor expect other money than what they earn. If you are told
that the daughter of an old man who has earned his own bread is about to marry a young man
in the same condition of life, it is spoken of as a misfortune. But Lord Llwddythlw was old-fashioned,
and had the means of acting in accordance with his prejudices. Have been had her superego been cared?
Have we has been novel daughter-dog so he are being pop?

 The
spaces did not seem to admit of majestic grouping, and as three of these chief personages had
the gout, the sticks of these lame gentlemen were to my eyes very conspicuous. The bevy had
not room enough, and the ladies in the crush seemed to feel the intense heat. Something had
made the Bishop cross. I am told that Lady Amaldina had determined not to be hurried, while
the Bishop was due at an afternoon meeting at three. The artist, in creating the special work
of art, had soared boldly into the ideal. In depicting the buffet of presents and the bridal
feast, he may probably have been more accurate. I was not myself present. The youthful appearance
of the bridegroom as he rose to make his speech may probably be attributed to a poetic license,
permissible, nay laudable, nay necessary on such an occasion. The buffet of presents no doubt
was all there; though it may be doubted whether the contributions from Royalty were in truth
so conspicuous as they were made to appear. There were speeches spoken by two or three Foreign
Ministers, and one by the bride's father. But the speech which has created most remark was
from the bridegroom. "I hope we may be as happy as your kind wishes would have us," said he;--and
then he sat down. It was declared afterwards that these were the only words which passed his
lips on the occasion. To those who congratulated him he merely gave his hand and bowed, and
yet he looked to be neither fluttered nor ill at ease. We know how a brave man will sit and
have his tooth taken out, without a sign of pain on his brow,--trusting to the relief which
is to come to him. So it was with Lord Llwddythlw. It might, perhaps, have saved pain if, as
Lady Amaldina had said, chloroform could have been used.

"Well, my dear, it is done at last," Lady Persiflage said to her daughter, when the bride was
taken into some chamber for the readjustment of her dress.

"Yes, mamma, it is done now."

"And are you happy?"

"Certainly I am. I have got what I wanted."

"And you can love him?" Coming from Lady Persiflage this did seem to be romantic; but she had
been stirred up to some serious thoughts as she remembered that she was now surrendering to
a husband the girl whom she had made, whom she had tutored, whom she had prepared either for
the good or for the evil performance of the duties of life.

"Oh, yes, mamma," said Lady Amaldina. It is so often the case that the pupils are able to exceed
the teaching of their tutors! It was so in this case. The mother, as she saw her girl given
up to a silent middle-aged unattractive man, had her misgivings; but not so the daughter herself.
She had looked at it all round, and had resolved that she could do her duty--under certain
stipulations which she thought would be accorded to her. "He has more to say for himself than
you think;--only he won't trouble himself to make assertions. And if he is not very much in
love, he likes me better than anybody else, which goes a long way." Her mother blessed her,
and led her away into a room where she joined her husband in order that she might be then taken
down to the carriage.

The bride herself had not quite understood what was to take place, and was surprised to find
herself quite alone for a moment with her husband. "My wife," he said; "now kiss me."

She ran into his arms and put up her face to him. "I thought you were going to forget that,"
she said, as he held her for a moment with his arm round her waist.

"I could not dare," he said, "to handle all that gorgeous drapery of lace. You were dressed
up then for an exhibition. You look now as my wife ought to look."

"It had to be done, Llwddythlw."

"I make no complaint, dearest. I only say that I like you better as you are, as a girl to kiss,
and to embrace, and to talk to, and to make my own." Then she curtsied to him prettily, and
kissed him again; and after that they walked out arm-in-arm down to the carriage.

There were many carriages drawn up within the quadrangle of which the Foreign Office forms
a part, but the carriage which was to take the bride and the bridegroom away was allowed a
door to itself,--at any rate till such time as they should have been taken away. An effort
had been made to keep the public out of the quadrangle; but as the duties of the four Secretaries
of State could not be suspended, and as the great gates are supposed to make a public thoroughfare,
this could only be done to a certain extent. The crowd, no doubt, was thicker out in Downing
Street, but there were very many standing within the square. Among these there was one, beautifully
arrayed in frock coat and yellow gloves, almost as though he himself was prepared for his own
wedding. When Lord Llwddythlw brought Lady Amaldina out from the building and handed her into
the carriage, and when the husband and wife had seated themselves, the well-dressed individual
raised his hat from his head, and greeted them. To cross-index and he would off been racine'siemens lords,

 "He has been interfering with me in the tenderest of parts." Lord
Hampstead looked serious. "There is a young woman"--the poor victim frowned, he knew not why;
but remitted his frown and smiled again; "who had promised herself to me. Then that rude assailant
came and upset all my joy." Here, as the narrator paused, Lord Hampstead owned to himself that
he could not deny the truth of the description. "Perhaps," continued Tribbledale,--"perhaps
you have seen Clara Demijohn." Lord Hampstead could not remember having been so fortunate.
"Because I am aware that your steps have wandered in the way of Paradise Row." Then there came
the frown again,--and then the smile. "Well;--perhaps it may be that a more perfect form of
feminine beauty may be ascribed to another." This was intended as a compliment, more civil
than true, paid to Marion Fay on Lord Hampstead's behalf. "But for a combination of chastity
and tenderness I don't think you can easily beat Clara Demijohn." Lord Hampstead bowed, as
showing his readiness to believe such a statement coming from so good a judge. "For awhile
the interloper prevailed. Interlopers do prevail;--such is the female heart. But the true rock
shows itself always at last. She is the true rock on which I have built the castle of my happiness."

"Then I may congratulate you, Mr. Tribbledale."

"Yes;--and not only that, my lord. But Crocker is nowhere. You must own that there is a triumph
in that. There was a time! Oh! how I felt it. There was a time when he triumphed; when he talked
of 'my Clara,' as though I hadn't a chance. He's up a tree now, my lord. I thought I'd just
tell you as you are so friendly, coming among us, here, my lord!" Lord Hampstead again congratulated
him, and expressed a hope that he might be allowed to send the bride a small present.

"Oh, my lord," said Tribbledale, "it shall go with the clock and the harmonium, and shall be
the proudest moment of my life."

When Miss Demijohn heard that the salary of Pogson and Littlebird's clerk,--she called it "Dan's
screw" in speaking of the matter to her aunt,--had been raised to £160 per annum, she felt
that there could be no excuse for a further change. Up to that moment it had seemed to her
that Tribbledale had obtained his triumph by a deceit which it still might be her duty to frustrate.
He had declared positively that those fatal words had been actually written in the book, "Dismissal--B.
B." But she had learned that the words had not been written as yet. All is fair in love and
war. She was not in the least angry with Tribbledale because of his little ruse. A lie told
in such a cause was a merit. But not on that account need she be led away by it from her own
most advantageous course. In spite of the little quarrel which had sprung up between herself
and Crocker, Crocker, still belonging to Her Majesty's Civil Service, must be better than Tribbledale.
But when she found that Tribbledale's statement as to the £160 was true, and when she bethought
herself that Crocker would probably be dismissed sooner or later, then she determined to be
firm. As to the £160, old Mrs. Demijohn herself went to the office, and learned the truth from
Zachary Fay. "I think he is a good young man," said the Quaker, "and he will do very well if
he will cease to think quite so much of himself." To this Mrs. Demijohn remarked that half-a-dozen
babies might probably cure that fault.

So the matter was settled, and it came to pass that Daniel Tribbledale and Clara Demijohn were
married at Holloway on that very Thursday which saw completed the alliance which had been so
long arranged between the noble houses of Powell and De Hauteville. There were two letters
written on the occasion which shall be given here as showing the willingness to forget and
forgive which marked the characters of the two persons. A day or two before the marriage the
following invitation was sent;--

   DEAR SAM,--

   I hope you will quite forget what is past, at any rate
   what was unpleasant, and come to our wedding on Thursday.
   There is to be a little breakfast here afterwards, and
   I am sure that Dan will be very happy to shake your hand.
   I have asked him, and he says that as he is to be the
   bridegroom he would be proud to have you as best man.

   Your old sincere friend,

   CLARA DEMIJOHN,--for the present.

The answer was as follows:--

   DEAR CLARA,--

   There's no malice in me. Since our little tiff I have been
   thinking that, after all, I'm not the man for matrimony.
   To sip the honey from many flowers is, perhaps, after
   all my line of life. I should have been happy to be Dan
   Tribbledale's bottle-holder, but that there is another
   affair coming off which I must attend. Our Lady Amaldina
   is to be married, and I must be there. Our families have
   been connected, as you know, for a great many years, and
   I could not forgive myself if I did not see her turned
   off. No other consideration would have prevented me from
   accepting your very kind invitation.

   Your loving old friend,

   SAM CROCKER.

There did come a pang of regret across Clara's heart, as she read this as to the connection
of the families. Of course Crocker was lying. Of course it was an empty boast. But there was
a savour of aristocracy even in the capability of telling such a lie. Had she made Crocker
her husband she also would have been able to drag Castle Hautboy into her daily conversations
with Mrs. Duffer.

At the time of these weddings, the month of August, Æolus had not even yet come to a positive
and actual decision as to Crocker's fate. Crocker had been suspended;--by which act he had
been temporarily expelled from the office, so that his time was all his own to do what he pleased
with it. Whether when suspended he would receive his salary, no one knew as a certainty. The
presumption was that a man suspended would be dismissed,--unless he could succeed in explaining
away or diminishing the sin of which he had been supposed to be guilty. Æolus himself could
suspend, but it required an act on the part of the senior officer to dismiss,--or even to deprive
the sinner of any part of his official emoluments. There had been no explanation possible.
No diminishing of the sin had been attempted. It was acknowledged on all sides that Crocker
had,--as Miss Demijohn properly described it,--destroyed Her Majesty's Mail papers. In order
that unpardonable delay and idleness might not be traced home to him, he had torn into fragments
a bundle of official documents. His character was so well known that no one doubted his dismissal.
Mr. Jerningham had spoken of it as a thing accomplished. Bobbin and Geraghty had been congratulated
on their rise in the department. "Dismissal--B. B." had been recorded, if not in any official
book, at any rate in all official minds. But B. B. himself had as yet decided nothing. When
Crocker attended Lady Amaldina's wedding in his best coat and gloves he was still under suspension;
but trusting to the conviction that after so long a reprieve capital punishment would not be
carried out.

Sir Boreas Bodkin had shoved the papers on one side, and, since that, nothing further had been
said on the matter. Weeks had passed, but no decision had been made public. Sir Boreas was
a man whom the subordinates nearest to him did not like to remind as to any such duty as this.
When a case was "shoved on one side" it was known to be something unpalateable. And yet, as
Mr. Jerningham whispered to George Roden, it was a thing that ought to be settled. "He can't
come back, you know," he said.

"I dare say he will," said the Duca.

"Impossible! I look upon it as impossible!" This Mr. Jerningham said very seriously.

"There are some people, you know," rejoined the other, "whose bark is so much worse than their
bite."

"I know there are, Mr. Roden, and Sir Boreas is perhaps one of them; but there are cases in
which to pardon the thing done seems to be perfectly impossible. This is one of them. If papers
are to be destroyed with impunity, what is to become of the Department? I for one should not
know how to go on with my duties. Tearing up papers! Good Heavens! When I think of it I doubt
whether I am standing on my head or my heels."

This was very strong language for Mr. Jerningham, who was not accustomed to find fault with
the proceedings of his superiors. He went about the office all these weeks with a visage of
woe and the air of a man conscious that some great evil was at hand. Sir Boreas had observed
it, and knew well why that visage was so long. Nevertheless when his eyes fell on that bundle
of papers,--on the Crocker bundle of papers,--he only pushed it a little further out of sight
than it was before.

Who does not know how odious a letter will become by being shoved on one side day after day?
Answer it at the moment, and it will be nothing. Put it away unread, or at least undigested,
for a day, and it at once begins to assume ugly proportions. When you have been weak enough
to let it lie on your desk, or worse again, hidden in your breast-pocket, for a week or ten
days, it will have become an enemy so strong and so odious that you will not dare to attack
it. It throws a gloom over all your joys. It makes you cross to your wife, severe to the cook,
and critical to your own wine-cellar. It becomes the Black Care which sits behind you when
you go out a riding. You have neglected a duty, and have put yourself in the power of perhaps
some vulgar snarler. You think of destroying it and denying it, dishonestly and falsely,--as
Crocker did the mail papers. And yet you must bear yourself all the time as though there were
no load lying near your heart. So it was with our Æolus and the Crocker papers. The papers
had become a great bundle. The unfortunate man had been called upon for an explanation, and
had written a blundering long letter on a huge sheet of foolscap paper,--which Sir Boreas had
not read, and did not mean to read. Large fragments of the torn "mail papers" had been found,
and were all there. Mr. Jerningham had written a well-worded lengthy report,--which never certainly
would be read. There were former documents in which the existence of the papers had been denied.
Altogether the bundle was big and unholy and distasteful. Those who knew our Æolus well were
sure that he would never even undo the tape by which the bundle was tied. But something must
be done. One month's pay-day had already passed since the suspension, and the next was at hand.
"Can anything be settled about Mr. Crocker?" asked Mr. Jerningham, one day about the end of
August. Sir Boreas had already sent his family to a little place he had in the West of Ireland,
and was postponing his holiday because of this horrid matter. Mr. Jerningham could never go
away till Æolus went. Sir Boreas knew all this, and was thoroughly ashamed of himself. "Just
speak to me about it to-morrow and we'll settle the matter," he said, in his blandest voice.
Mr. Jerningham retreated from the room frowning. According to his thinking there ought to be
nothing to settle. "D---- the fellow," said Sir Boreas, as soon as the door was closed; and
he gave the papers another shove which sent them off the huge table on to the floor. Whether
it was Mr. Jerningham or Crocker who was damned, he hardly knew himself. Then he was forced
to stoop to the humility of picking up the bundle.

That afternoon he roused himself. About three o'clock he sent, not for Mr. Jerningham, but
for the Duca. When Roden entered the room the bundle was before him, but not opened. "Can you
send for this man and get him here to-day?" he asked. The Duca promised that he would do his
best. "I can't bring myself to recommend his dismissal," he said. The Duca only smiled. "The
poor fellow is just going to be married, you know." The Duca smiled again. Living in Paradise
Row himself, he knew that the lady, née Clara Demijohn, was already the happy wife of Mr. Tribbledale.
But he knew also that after so long an interval Crocker could not well be dismissed, and he
was not ill-natured enough to rob his chief of so good an excuse. He left the room, therefore,
declaring that he would cause Crocker to be summoned immediately.

Crocker was summoned, and came. Had Sir Boreas made up his mind briefly to dismiss the man,
or briefly to forgive him, the interview would have been unnecessary. As things now were the
man could not certainly be dismissed. Sir Boreas was aware of that. Nor could he be pardoned
without further notice. Crocker entered the room with that mingling of the bully and the coward
in his appearance which is generally the result when a man who is overawed attempts to show
that he is not afraid. Sir Boreas passed his fingers through the hairs on each side of his
head, frowned hard, and, blowing through his nostrils, became at once the Æolus that he had
been named;

      Assumes the god,
      Affects to nod,
   And seems to shake the spheres.

"Mr. Crocker," said the god, laying his hand on the bundle of papers still tied up in a lump.
Then he paused and blew the wrath out of his nostrils.

"Sir Boreas, no one can be more sorry for an accident than I am for that."

"An accident!"

"Well, Sir Boreas; I am afraid I shall not make you understand it all."

"I don't think you will."

"The first paper I did tear up by accident, thinking it was something done with."

"Then you thought you might as well send the others after it."

"One or two were torn by accident. Then--"

"Well!"

"I hope you'll look it over this time, Sir Boreas."

"I have done nothing but look it over, as you call it, since you came into the Department.
You've been a disgrace to the office. You're of no use whatsoever. You give more trouble than
all the other clerks put together. I'm sick of hearing your name."

"If you'll try me again I'll turn over a new leaf, Sir Boreas."

"I don't believe it for a moment. They tell me you're just going to be married." Crocker was
silent. Could he be expected to cut the ground from under his own feet at such a moment? "For
the young lady's sake, I don't like turning you adrift on the world at such a time. I only
wish that she had a more secure basis for her happiness."

"She'll be all right," said Crocker. He will probably be thought to have been justified in
carrying on the delusion at such a crisis of his life.

"But you must take my assurance of this," said Æolus, looking more like the god of storms,
"that no wife or baby,--no joy or trouble,--shall save you again if you again deserve dismissal."
Crocker with his most affable smile thanked Sir Boreas and withdrew. It was said afterwards
that Sir Boreas had seen and read that smile on Roden's face, had put two and two together
in regard to him, and had become sure that there was to be no marriage. But, had he lost that
excuse, where should he find another?

CHAPTER XIX.

"MY MARION."

The blow came very suddenly at last. About the middle of September the spirit of Marion Fay
flitted away from all its earthly joys and all its earthly troubles. Lord Hampstead saw her
alive for the last time at that interview which was described a few pages back. Whenever he
proposed to go down again to Pegwell Bay some objection was made, either by the Quaker or by
Mrs. Roden on the Quaker's behalf. The doctor, it was alleged, had declared that such visits
were injurious to his patient,--or perhaps it was that Marion had herself said that she was
unable to bear the excitement. There was, no doubt, some truth in this. And Marion had seen
that though she herself could enjoy the boundless love which her lover tendered to her, telling
herself that though it was only for a while, it was very sweet to have it so, yet for him these
meetings were full of agony. These questions--'Culture, innutritious, and giving-- should t do believe

 For me they can do nothing,--unless it be that in
knowing how much she loved me I may strive to be as she was."

"And for your happiness."

"Psha!" he exclaimed.

"You must let me do her commission, Lord Hampstead. I was to bid you remember that God in His
goodness has ordained that the dead after awhile shall be remembered only with a softened sorrow.
I was to tell you that as a man you should give your thoughts to other things. It is not from
myself;--it is from her."

"She did not know. She did not understand. As regards good and evil she was, to my eyes, perfect;--perfect
as she was in beauty, in grace, and feminine tenderness. But the character of others she had
not learned to read. But I need not trouble you as to that, Mrs. Roden. You have been good
to her as though you were her mother, and I will love you for it while I live." Then he was
going away; but he turned again to ask some question as to the funeral. Might he do it. Mrs.
Roden shook her head. "But I shall be there?" To this she assented, but explained to him that
Zachary Fay would admit of no interference with that which he considered to be his own privilege
and his own duty.

Lord Hampstead had driven himself over from Hendon Hall, and had driven fast. When he left
Mrs. Roden's house the groom was driving the dog-cart up and down Paradise Row, waiting for
his master. But the master walked on out of the Row, forgetting altogether the horse and the
cart and the man, not knowing whither he was going.

The blow had come, and though it had been fully expected, though he had known well that it
was coming, it struck him now as hard, almost harder than if it had not been expected. It seemed
to himself that he was unable to endure his sorrow now because he had been already weakened
by such a load of sorrow. Because he had grieved so much, he could not now bear this further
grief. As he walked on he beat his hands about, unconscious that he was in the midst of men
and women who were gazing at him in the streets. There was nothing left to him,--nothing, nothing,
nothing! He felt that if he could rid himself of his titles, rid himself of his wealth, rid
himself of the very clothes upon his back, it would be better for him, so that he might not
seem to himself to think that comfort could be found in externals. "Marion," he said, over
and over again, in little whispered words, but loud enough for his own ears to hear the sound.
And then he uttered phrases which were almost fantastic in their woe, but which declared what
was and had been the condition of his mind towards her since she had become so inexpressibly
dear to him. "My wife," he said, "my own one! Mother of my children. My woman; my countess;
my princess. They should have seen. They should have acknowledged. They should have known whom
it was that I had brought among them;--of what nature should be the woman whom a man should
set in a high place. I had made my choice;--and then that it should come to this!" "There is
no good to be done," he said again. "It all turns to ashes and to dust. The low things of the
world are those which prevail." "Oh, Marion, that I could be with you! Though it were to be
nowhere,--though the great story should have no pathetic ending, though the last long eternal
chapter should be a blank,--still to have wandered away with you would have been something."
As soon as he reached his house he walked straight into the drawing-room, and having carefully
closed the door, he took the poker in his hand and held it clasped there as something precious.
"It is the only thing of mine," he said, "that she has touched. Even then I swore to myself
that this hearth should be her hearth; that here we would sit together, and be one flesh and
one bone." Then surreptitiously he took the bit of iron away with him, and hid it among his
treasures,--to the subsequent dismay of the housemaid.

There came to him a summons from the Quaker to the funeral, and on the day named, without saying
a word to any one, he took the train and went down to Pegwell Bay. From the moment on which
the messenger had come from Mrs. Roden he had dressed himself in black, and he now made no
difference in his garments. Poor Zachary said but little to him; but that little was very bitter.
"It has been so with all of them," he said. "They have all been taken. The Lord cannot strike
me again now." Of the highly-born stranger's grief, or of the cause which brought him there,
he had not a word to say; nor did Lord Hampstead speak of his own sorrow. "I sympathize and
condole with you," he said to the old man. The Quaker shook his head, and after that there
was silence between them till they parted. To the few others who were there Lord Hampstead
did not address himself, nor did they to him. From the grave, when the clod of earth had been
thrown on it, he walked slowly away, without a sign on his face of that agony which was rending
his heart. There was a carriage there to take him to the railway, but he only shook his head
when he was invited to enter it. He walked off and wandered about for hours, till he thought
that the graveyard would be deserted. Then he returned, and when he found himself alone he
stood over the newly heaped-up soil. "Marion," he said to himself over and over again, whispering
as he stood there. "Marion,--Marion; my wife; my woman." As he stood by the grave side, one
came softly stealing up to him, and laid a hand upon his shoulder. He turned round quickly,
and saw that it was the bereaved father. "Mr. Fay," he said, "we have both lost the only thing
that either of us valued."

"What is it to thee, who are young, and hardly knew her twelve months since?"

"Months make no difference, I think."

"But old age, my lord, and childishness, and solitude--"

"I, too, am alone."

"She was my daughter, my own. Thou hadst seen a pretty face, and that was all. She had remained
with me when those others died. Had thou not come--"

"Did my coming kill her, Mr. Fay'?"

"I do not say that. Thou hast been good to her, and I would not say a hard word to thee."

"I did think that nothing could have added to my sorrow."

"No, my lord; no, no. She would have died. She was her dear mother's child, and she was doomed.
Go away, and be thankful that thou, too, hast not become the father of children born only to
perish in your sight. I will not say an unkind word, but I would wish to have my girl's grave
to myself." Upon this Lord Hampstead walked off, and went back to his own home, hardly knowing
how he reached it.

It was a month after this that he returned to the churchyard, and might have been seen sitting
on the small stone slab which the Quaker had already caused to be laid over the grave. It was
a fine October evening, and the sombre gloom of the hours was already darkening everything
around. He had crept into the enclosure silently, almost slily, so as to insure himself that
his presence should not be noted; and now, made confident by the coming darkness, he had seated
himself on the stone. During the long hours that he sat there no word was formed within his
lips, but he surrendered himself entirely to thoughts of what his life might have been had
she been spared to him. He had come there for a purpose, the very opposite of that; but how
often does it come to pass that we are unable to drive our thoughts into that channel in which
we wish them to flow? He had thought much of her last words, and was minded to attempt to do
something as she would have had him do it;--not that he might enjoy his life, but that he might
make it useful. Forty years more, had that scholar, JEAN and Appleslocombe meung, added nothing to
the 4000 lines which Lorris had made no any than 18,000 of own. This addition was not extraordinarily
be quite out of proportion but entirely very out of tone with fewer work. Jean Lorris meung left
also to have used more refined and aristocratic class of his predecessor,
and wrote with the realism and coarseness of the atmosphere to another
day.

De's young insignificance is abandoned into allegory, becoming a peg during the mass of quite has varied
discourse. He would leave that building up of a future family of Marquises,--if future Marquises
there were to be,--to one of those young darlings whose bringing-up would manifestly fit them
for the work. For himself he would perhaps philosophize, perhaps do something that might be
of service,--would indulge at any rate his own views as to humanity;--but he would not burden
himself with a Countess and a nursery full of young lords and ladies. He had often said to
Roden, had often said to Vivian, that her ladyship, his stepmother, need not trouble herself.
He certainly would not be guilty of making either a Countess or a Marchioness. They, of course,
had laughed at him, and had bid him bide his time. He had bided his time,--as they had said,--and
Marion Fay had been the result.
