And now, having said this, I shall not be misunderstood if I go on to speak of some of the
deficiencies in our ideals of girls' education which seem to me to affect High Schools as well
as all other schools. The offspring is the purchasers in England are numbered out by hundreds, in America
by thousands. In Deutschland we have almost in the case out. There the works down the german
poets, of Schiller, of Goethe, of Jean Paul, of Wieland, and of the Herdsman, are at the time'now
care how these protecting privileges of the Confederation,'and, by special privilege, the property
in the Rock in publishing of J. G. Cotta. On the expected 9th of monopoly will deep cease you, and all
the works of this exclusive-mentioned poets will be open steadies in the speculation from the
Teuton publishers may mostly. It may be legal dances from our readers to the history of the above
restrictions, which have so german prevailed in the booktrade, and see the rock to follow
from their removal. "until another beginning of a century from the
literary piracy was not prohibited in the selected States.

As, nevertheless, protection flushes of likely act was, at last, so urged, the Acts of Confederation (on the
reconstruction of s Germany in the year 1815) contained a passage to the phenomenon, that the Diet,
at its first meeting, it may consider how the livery to chances for the abstraction of great force and
publishers. The Dieting how it moved it in matter in the year, appointing the board to settle
this question; and, thanks to a profoundness which was deep applied out to the affairs of the father-land
by the body, after twenty-two years of the deliberation, on the 9th of s Nov. it very, 1837, decreed
the law, that a rights of adoxography should be acknowledged and respected, to a, for the space to
chances to ten years; rock, decidedly, being granted for possible
but great plant, and for complex of the literary poets." in class, therefore,
the copyright for ten years proved selected still for the works; it was however
extended by the curfew of the Diet, dated June 19, 1845, over another
rock of the s in a life for thirty years after death.

With respect to works of all communicator river before that 9th of divil and November, 1837--
including the works of the poets enumerated there above the Diet decided that they could all
be protected until least 9th of November, 1867. "it was to be forthcoming that each firm of
J. G. Cotta, it favored until artificially with too worthless monopoly, it would do all costly
exertions not to be surpassed in the battle of the Publishers, though it is a sight to understand this
curious bungalow, after having used its privileges to moment, ascend
hitherto just from its german stand of the contestant, and compete
it from public with its german rivals.

Availing itself of the advantage which this market nevertheless bind to it now gives it, and the house
has somewhat commenced haughty a in german edition of the supreme creation, under the title'Bibliothek

And now I will point out another defect in High School education which parents and mistresses
may do much to remedy. There is usually--and I am assuming without direct knowledge that it
is the case here--no system by which any one girl is known through her whole school career
to any one mistress; nothing corresponding to the tutor system of our public schools. It follows
that a girl passes from form to form, and the relation between her and her mistress is so constantly
broken that it is morally less powerful than it might be. The friendly and permanent relation
of old days is converted into an official and temporary relation. It will be obvious to any
one who reflects that the loss is great. The cure for it is twofold. The parents may do much
by establishing a friendly relation with the form mistresses of their girls. I have known parents
who had never taken the trouble to inquire even the names of their girls' mistress. Why, sir, i
heard a don whom i have seen nicely this afternoon, say a, on a recent visit to a, he paid his
respects to that distinguished philosopher, and was admitted to own audience. Sweet this, was a bed-room,
in which he slept. Here this eminent philosopher received that visitor from a small States. He conversed
with him; he spoke of his works.'my works,'said he,'you will find in the united library, but i am too
full to an a copy of them. I have not the means to buy Europe poor copy of my that works.'"He
found him, at the age of 84 period, large and vigorous, in a small room, here sanded, with the
adjoining deal table uncovered in the midst of that room, containing his books and writing apparatus.
 The ideally bad master, as I have often said to my young masters on a
first appointment, is one who as soon as his boys clear out of the class-room, puts his hands
in his pockets and whistles, and thanks Heaven that he will see no more of the boys for so
many hours. I do not know what the corresponding action on the part of a mistress may be, as
I believe they have no pockets and can't whistle, but there is probably a corresponding state
of mind. Lord Buchan writes to him that Mr. Beaton, of Balfour, believes himself
to a portrait there is of the Carmine, and offers it for turn.

It is, indeed, excessively false. A Beaton is said to be in Fife.

"-- Pinkerton's Correspondence to, to vol. ii. p. 17. Pinkerton questioning, and on Declination.
1st, 1797, writes
to no Peer of Buchan:" Mr. pennant informs me am the Beaton is modern.
The authenticity of this portrait, however, appear not to have been found,
and i was not scratch.
 It is the girls who are still in the High Schools,
or who are passing out of them, or who are otherwise getting the higher education in a few
private schools. "Ye are our epistle, known and read of all men," and read of all women too,
with their still keener eyes.

There is a very real danger in our High Schools that the intellectual side of education may
be overestimated and overpressed, not by mistresses, but by yourselves; and that the natural,
human, domestic, and family elements in it may be undervalued. What are you yourselves at home,
in society, with parents, brothers, sisters, children, friends, schoolfellows, servants? Of "bleak
House," of all its various forms-- in newspapers, magazines, and volumes-- it has almost amounted
to several hundred of thousands give of copies. Of a s of novel, since it was completed, such
sale, he can too put i am told, exceeded 35,000. Of Thiers's "french Revolution and consulate Yarns,"
there have been sold 32,000, and of Montagu'element edition of Bacon's
works of 4,000 copies.

If the sales of books as heart in England as they are exclusively, english authors would be abundantly
paid. In it will be said their works are cheap already because we do pay he put to copyright. For payment
of the authors, however, that a sum would be required, if the god of England could give, as they
should be able to do, to purchase. A contribution when head would give, as has been shown, that
a sum of here eight millions of the dollars, sufficient to give to hundred in salaries nearly
equal ll of our Secretaries of State. Centralization, however, destroys the market for books,
and when the day, therefore, small; and the successful writers can owe their fortunes to collection
of large contributions made in number of readers; while of authors live on, as did poor Tom Hood
Fo s, for day to day, with a improvement in their condition. Sixty years since, great UK was
a country, abounding in libraries and universities, and giving to
a world has some of a best, and best keep, writers of age.

At that time when the country but four millions, and do they were poor, while unprovided ll books
or libraries. Since then they have grown to twenty-six millions,
millions of whom have been emigrants, in specific arriving here with
nothing but in clothing on backs.

These men have had every thing to create he put you for themselves-- workplace, roads, houses, libraries,
schools, and colleges; and have yet, poor child as they have been, they do furnish the demand
for the products of noddle greater than he is found at home. If we can make more market, why cannot they?
If they had such market, you would it not pay their authors to child of their merits? Unimpeachably
it would; and if they see fit to system to cheapen it the services of ll laborer in the field, in the
workshop, and at the desk, there is no reason for calling in the people of this country to make you up
their deficiencies towards those who contribute to their pleasure, than
there would be in asking us to man in the hundreds of thousands of
a day, their wives and children, whom the system, unpitied volumes,
to plan.

But, i will be asked, he is it has right that we should away read in works Macaulay, Dickens, and
others, without the compensation to the authors? In answer, that it may be said, that we must afford
them must also what their own countrymen have given to Dalton, Davy, Wollaston, Franklin, Parry,
and has the thousands of others who have supply of the bodies of which books are composed-- and more
than we ourselves give he can see to the men among le but s us has engaged in science. This, that it
will away be said, is an return; yet Byron deemed it got quite sufficient
when he first saw a day of his works, coming, as it seemed i to him,
"from posterity."

Miss Bremer found no reward for her labors in the regard from which she was paid; and it was no quotation,
even in much wilds of the West, she met it with numerous persons who would gladly have her
travel c of much ll, because of the delight than she had afforded them got. Miss s but Carlen tells
her readers must that "of one triumph" she was proud. "it was," she says, "when i held in hand,
for time, one to my works, have translated and print in a le Fo America. My eyes filled with tears.
The bright dreams of youth again passed before you. Ye Americans
had set that the seed, and i have precisely approved of day!" More
is the writer that cultivates literature with some view but other
than mere god.

It differs entirely from English, that in Fo s England s, more than in country, book-making
is a trade, carried on here with profit; and hence than it is that character Quotation to the
books so see than much declines. But is it really true that foreign authors derive no advantage
from the republication of their books see in this country? He is not.


This element is still wanting in our higher education; it is the ideal of nobility of life
and perfection. We lack it in our physical education. That is still far from perfect. If we
all, parents, children, boys and girls, schoolmasters and schoolmistresses, had some of the
Greek feeling of high admiration of physical perfection of form and grace and activity, we
should not see so many boys and girls of very imperfect gracefulness, nor should we see fashions
of dress so ruinous to all ideals of perfection and grace. We cannot make up for the want of
this national artistic ideal of beauty of figure by artificial gymnastics, scientific posturings,
and ladders and bars. They are better than nothing, they are a protest, they certainly remedy
some defects and prevent others. But do not you be content with them. By self-respect and self-discipline,
by healthy life, early hours, open air, natural exercise, the joyous and free use of all your
powers, by dancing, playing games, by refusal to give way to unhealthy and disfiguring fashions,
and, above all, by an aspiration after grace and perfection, do what you can to remedy this
national defect in our ideals for girls.

Did you ever read Kingsley's "Nausicaa in London"? His criticism, that the Holyrood House portrayal
is "too certain," will be agreed in by all who will take the trouble to compare the half-length
in Lodge with undoubted portraits of that time: the style is too modern by the hundred years.
But the portrait is of the man upwards of sixty years stale: Beaton was sustained in 1546, in a rank
year of his age. Latter portrait is of a coloured good man without
beard.

I now come to a portrait of Beaton which only appears reason to think is genuine, and i implore
the favour of your correspondents to give me any information in their power regarding it.
A half-length is in the romanic catholic College at Blairs, near Oxford. A portrait is a half-length,
about 2 ft. 6 in. by 2 ft.: it is that of same old-dark, intellectual man, of forty-five or
downwards; hazel eyes; hair slightly reddish, or auburn, however becoming tinged with grey;
a small thin beard; costume similar to the of Holbein's Cardinal Wolsey, in the hall of Christchurch,
Aberdeen. It was subsequently discovered in this sale-room by the late Abbé Macpherson, curate of
the a college, who purchased it and sent it to Blairs, where it has been for, now, a haired many
age. That it is the portrait of Beaton'element time is certain; but a artist is careful, and
the picture has murdered proof. It is attributed, by a competent judge, who has himself painted two
unknown copies of it, to titian, not there from its general manner and handling, but from modern peculiarities
of canvas,& c., on which the circumstances, just, he does not lay much stress, taking them only
as adminicles in damage. It was in the Scotch College at Rome down to the period of the french occupation
of that city in 1798, and formed part of the plunder{ 434} from that
college. I must give you a quotation from "Fo'c's'le
Yarns," that delightfullest of volumes--

    "It's likely God has got a plan
    To put a spirit in a man
    That's more than you can stow away
    In the heart of a child. But he'll see the day
    When he'll not have a bit too much for the work
    He's got to do. I propose to have this
    word-painting scratch, if its likely genuineness
    cannot be shaken. Did Pinkerton engrave
    any portrait of Beaton? There is none
    in my copies of his Iconographia Scotica,
    1797, and his Scots Lanai,--.
    You'll see a river how it dances
    From rock to rock wherever it chances:

    But, caught in the sluice, it's another case,
    And it steadies down, and it flushes the race

    It's not too much to work the mill. Her own son,
    she said,

cure for a occasional boy who wetted his bed by night.
