He sat down, stretched his arms on the table and laid his miserable head upon them, all among
the pages of the catalogue raisonné. He had passed from his agony of desire to an agony of
contrition. He felt that the very vehemence of his longing was an affront to her white unconsciousness
Up till now he had not admitted that he was "in love" with Lucia; he was indeed hardly aware
of it. He imagined his feeling for her to be something altogether immaterial and incorruptible.
It now seemed to him that in the last few minutes he had lowered it almost to the level of
the emotion inspired by Miss Poppy Grace. It was not, and it never could be, what it had been
three weeks ago. Why, he could not even recall his sensations of Easter Sunday, that strange
renewal of his heart's virginity his first vague imperfect vision of the dawn of love, his
joy when he discerned its tender and mysterious approach. He knew that it held no rights, or
held them only on the most subtle and uncertain tenure, that his soul touched the soul of Lucia
Harden by the extreme tips of its wings stretched to the utmost. Still his passion for her
had been, so far, satisfied by that difficult and immaterial relationship. He was bound to
her by an immaterial, intangible link.

But he had put an end to that relationship; he had broken the immaterial, intangible link.
It was as if he had given a body to some delicate and spiritual dream, and destroyed it in
a furious embrace. And in destroying it he had destroyed everything.

Then he reflected that though this deed seemed to belong wholly to the present moment, it had
in reality been done a long time before, when he first became the slave of that absurd and
execrable passion for Miss Poppy Grace. Rickman the poet had believed in Love, the immortal
and invincible, the highest of high divinities, and as such had celebrated him in song. But
he had been unfortunate in his first actual experience of him. He had found him, not "pacing
Heaven's golden floor," but staggering across Miss Grace's drawing-room, a most offensive,
fifth-rate, disreputable little god. Of course he knew it wasn't the same thing, it wasn't
the same thing at all. But he was bound by his past. He had forged a chain of infamous but
irresistible association that degraded love in his eyes, that in his thoughts degraded her.
Every hour that he had spent in the little dancer's society had its kindred with this hour.
In his passion for Lucia Harden there leapt up the passion of that night--that night three
weeks ago. It was then--then--that he had sinned against her.

He had not meant--he had not meant to love her--like that. And yet he perceived how all along,
unremittently, imperceptibly, this passion had waylaid him and misled him and found him out.
It was it that had drawn him every morning across the fields to Court House, that upheld him
on his giddy perch on the library steps, that chained him to his chair at the library table
and kept him sweating over that abominable catalogue till four o'clock in the morning. It had
looked at him with so pure and spiritual a face that he had not recognized it. 14. [Application of one Provisions

The horror of his position returned upon him, the burden of his knowledge and her ignorance.
If only she knew, if only he could go to her and tell her everything, all that he knew and
all that he guessed! He was still firm in his conviction that he had no moral right to his
knowledge; it was a thing he almost seemed to have come by dishonestly. If Miss Harden knew
nothing of her father's affairs, it was to be presumed that they had been purposely kept from
her to save her pain. He had no right to tell her.

No matter, he would tell her, he would tell her this morning, and having told her, he would
go away.

He got up and paced to and fro again. He stood before the open window till he had chilled himself
through; then he came back and cowered over the fire. A white thing lay by the hearth at his
feet, it was Lucia Harden's shawl, lying crumpled where he had thrown it. It was the sign and
symbol of her presence there. It was also the proof of it.

How would she feel if she knew that he had been aware of it all the time? The fact remained
that she had risked his waking; there was comfort for him in that. She had always been kind
to him, and he had never had even a momentary illusion as to the source and the nature of her
kindness. He had taken it, as he had taken her extreme courtesy, for the measure of the distance
that divided them. It showed her secure in her detachment, her freedom from any intimate thought
of him, from any thought of him at all. But in this last act of kindness it could hardly be
that she had not taken him into consideration. She could hardly have been pleased if she knew
he had been awake, yet she had risked his waking. Before she risked it she must have credited
him with something of her own simplicity of soul.

And this was how he had repaid her.

He saw her as she had knelt by him, mending the dying fire, as she had stood looking at him,
as she had stooped over him to cover him, and as she had turned away; and he saw himself, sinning
as he had sinned against her in his heart.

He knew perfectly well that the average man would have felt no compunction whatever upon this
head. To the average man his imagination (if he has any) is an unreal thing; to Rickman it
was the most real thing about him. It was so young, and in its youth so ungovernably creative,
that it flung out its ideas, as it were, alive and kicking. It was only partially true of him
that his dream was divorced from reality. For with him the phantoms of the mind (which to the
average man are merely phantoms), projected themselves with a bodily vividness and violence.
Not only had they the colour and authority of accomplished fact, they were invested with an
immortality denied to facts. His imagination was in this so far spiritual that it perceived
desire to be the eternal soul of the deed, and the deed to be but the perishing body of desire.
From this point of view, conduct may figure as comparatively unimportant; therefore this point
of view is very properly avoided by the average man.

Rickman, now reduced to the last degree of humility and contrition, picked up Lucia's shawl
very gently and reverently, and folded it with care, smoothing out the horrid creases he had
made in it. He took it to the other end of the room and laid it over the back of her chair,
so that it might look to Robert as if his mistress had left it there.

Would he see her again that morning? That depended on the amount of work that remained for
her to do. He looked over her table; her tray was empty, the slips were pinned together in
bundles in the way he had taught her, Section XII, Poetry, was complete. There was nothing
now to keep her in the library. And he had only ten days' work to do. He might see her once
or twice perhaps on those days; but she would not sit with him, nor work with him, and when
the ten days were over she would go away and he would never see her again.

Then he remembered that he had got to tell her and go away himself, at once, this very morning.

Meanwhile he sat down and worked till it was time to go back to his hotel. He worked mechanically,
miserably, oppressed alike by his sense of his own villainy and of the futility of his task.
He did not know how, when it was ended, he was to take up this kind of work again. He had only
been kept up by his joy in her presence, and in her absence by the hope of her return. But
he could not bear to look into a future in which she had no part.

CHAPTER XXVII

He found a letter from Dicky Pilkington waiting for him at the hotel. Dicky's subtlety seemed
to have divined his scruples, for he gave him the information he most wanted in terms whose
terseness left very little room for uncertainty. "Look sharp," wrote Dicky, "and let me know
if you've made up your great mind about that library. If Freddy Harden doesn't pay up I shall
have to put my men in on the twenty-seventh. Between you and me there isn't the ghost of a
chance for Freddy. I hear the unlucky devil's just cleaned himself out at Monte Carlo."

The twenty-seventh? It was the day when Miss Harden was to join her father at Cannes. The coincidence
of dates was significant; it amounted to proof. It meant that Sir Frederick must have long
anticipated the catastrophe, and that he had the decency to spare her the last painful details.
She would not have to witness the invasion of the Vandals, the overturning of the household
gods, and the defilement of their sacred places.

Well, he thought bitterly, they couldn't be much more defiled than they were already. He saw
himself as an abominable object, a thing with a double face and an unclean and aitchless tongue,
sitting there from morning to night, spying, calculating, appraising, with a view to fraud.
At least that was how she would think of him when she knew; and he had got to tell her.

He was on the rack again; and the wonder was how he had ever left it. It seemed to him that
he could never have been long released at any time. He had had moments of comparative ease,
when he could lie on it at one end of the room and see Lucia sitting at the other, and the
sight of her must have soothed his agony. He had had moments of forgetfulness, of illusion,
when he had gone to sleep on the rack, and had dreamed the most delicious dreams, moments even
of deliverance, when his conscience, exhausted with the sheer effort of winding, had dropped
to sleep too. And then had come the reckless moments, when he had yielded himself wholly to
the delight of her presence; and that supreme instant when his love for Lucia seemed to have
set him free.

And now it was love itself, furiously accusing, that flung him back upon the torture, and stretched
him out further than he had been stretched before.

But Dicky's letter had to be answered at once. He settled Dicky for the present by reminding
him that nothing could be done by either of them till the twenty-seventh. But he thought that
if Sir Frederick or any of his family were unable to pay up, there ought to be no difficulty
in arranging with his father.

To his father he sent a word of warning. "For Goodness' sake don't commit yourself with Pilkington
until you see me. I shall probably be back in town to-morrow afternoon!"

Having settled Dicky, he breakfasted, bathed, was a little long over his dressing, taking care
that nothing in his appearance should suggest the dishevelled person of the dawn. Thus he was
rather later than usual in presenting himself at the library. He found Miss Harden there at
his end of the table, with his note-book, busy over his pile and engaged in finishing his Section--Philosophy.
Her clear and candid eyes greeted him without a shadow of remembrance. She had always this
air of accepting him provisionally, for the moment only, as if her kindness had no springs
in the past and could promise nothing for the future. He had always found this manner a little
distressing, and it baffled him completely now. Still, in another minute he would have to tell
her, whatever her manner or her mood.

"Miss Harden," he began, "you've been so awfully good to me, there's something that I want
most awfully to say to you."

"Well, say it." But there was that in her tone which warned him not to be too long about it.

"It's something I ought to have said--to have confessed--ages ago--"

"Oh no, really Mr. Rickman, if it's a confession, you mustn't do it now. We shall never finish
at this rate."

"When may I?"

"Some time in the afternoon, perhaps." Her smile, which was exceedingly subtle, disconcerted
him inexpressibly. She turned at once to the business of the day. The question was whether
he would begin on a new section, or finish this one with her, writing at her dictation?

He too was calm, business-like, detached. He strangled a happy smile which suggested that her
question was absurd. To start a new section was to work gloomily by himself, at some distant
quarter of the room; to write to her dictation was to be near her, soothed by her voice and
made forgetful by her eyes. Hypocritically he feigned a minute's reflection, as if it were
a matter for hesitation and for choice.

"Wouldn't you find it less tiring if I read and you wrote?"

"No, I had better read. You can write faster than I can."

So he wrote his fastest, while Lucia Harden read out titles to him in the sonorous Latin tongue.
She was standing ankle-deep in Gnostics and Neo-Platonists; as for Mr. Rickman, he was, as
he observed, out of his depth there altogether.

"Iamblichus, De Mysteriis Egyptiorum. Do you know him?"

Mr. Rickman smiled as he admitted that his acquaintance with Iamblichus was of the slightest;
Lucia laughed as she confessed an ignorance extending to the very name. He noticed that she
always seemed pleased when she had any ignorance to own up to; had she found out that this
gave pleasure to other people?

"Is he Philosophy, or is he Religion?" She invariably deferred to Rickman on a question of
classification. She handed the book to him. "Can you tell?"

"I really don't know; he seems to be both. I'd better have a look at him." He turned over the
pages, glancing at the text. "I say, listen to this."

He hit on a passage at random, and read out the Greek, translating fluently.

"'If then the presence of the divine fire and the unspeakable form of the divine light descend
upon a man, wholly filling and dominating him, and encompassing him on every side, so that
he can in no way carry on his own affairs, what sense or understanding or perception of ordinary
matters should he have who has received the divine fire?' Can he be referring to the business
capacity of poets?"

Lucia listened amused. And all the time he was thinking, "If I don't tell her now I shall never
tell her. She'll sneak off with Miss Palliser somewhere in the afternoon." Neither noticed
that Robert had come in and was standing by with a telegram. Robert gazed at Mr. Rickman with
admiration, while he respectfully waited for the end of the paragraph; that, he judged, being
the proper moment for attracting his mistress' attention.

Never in all his life would Rickman forget that passage in the De Mysteriis which he had not
been thinking about. As Lucia took the telegram she was still looking at Rickman and the smile
of amusement was still on her face. Robert respectfully withdrew. Lucia opened the envelope
and Rickman looked down, apparently absorbed in Iamblichus. 51. one.

 There had been nothing to wound him in that
gesture of repulse; it was as if she had accepted rather than refused his touch, as if her
numbed body took from it the impetus it craved.

There was a sound of hurry and confusion in the house; servants went up and downstairs, or
stood about whispering in the passages. He heard footsteps in that room above him which he
knew to be her room. A bell rang once; he could feel the vibration of the wire down the wall
of the library. It was her bell and he wondered if she were ill.

Robert rushed in with a wild white face, shaken out of his respectful calm. He was asking Rickman
if he had seen this month's Bradshaw. They joined in a frenzied search for it.

She was not ill; she was going away.

A few minutes later he heard the sound of wheels grating on the gravel drive, of the front
door being flung open, of her voice, her sweet quiet voice, then the grating of the wheels
again, and she was gone. That, of course, ended it.
