LET'EM BREATHE SPACE!

                          BY LESTER DEL REY

                        ILLUSTRATED BY EBERLE

     Eighteen men and two women in the closed world of a space
     ship for five months can only spell tension and trouble--but
     in this case, the atmosphere was literally poisoned.

       *       *       *       *       *

Five months out from Earth, we were half-way to Saturn and three-quarters of the way to murder.
At least, I was. I was sick of the feuding, the worries and the pettiness of the other nineteen
aboard. My stomach heaved at the bad food, the eternal smell of people, and the constant sound
of nagging and complaints. For ten lead pennies, I'd have gotten out into space and tried walking
back to Earth. Sometimes I thought about doing it without the pennies.

But I knew I wasn't that tough, in spite of what I looked. I'd been built to play fullback,
and my questionable brunet beauty had been roughed up by the explosion years before as thoroughly
as dock fighting on all the planets could have done. But sometimes I figured all that meant
was that there was more of me to hurt, and that I'd had more experience screaming when the
anodyne ran out.

Anyhow, whole-wheat pancakes made with sourdough for the ninth "morning" running was too damned
much! I felt my stomach heave over again, took one whiff of the imitation maple syrup, and
shoved the mess back fast while I got up faster.

       *       *       *       *       *

It was a mistake. Phil Riggs, our scrawny, half-pint meteorologist, grinned nastily and reached
for the plate. "'Smatter, Paul? Don't you like your breakfast? It's good for you--whole wheat
contains bran. The staff of life. Man, after that diet of bleached paste...."

       *       *       *       *       *

There's one guy like that in every bunch. The cook was mad at us for griping about his coffee,
so our group of scientists on this cockeyed Saturn Expedition were getting whole wheat flour
as punishment, while Captain Muller probably sat in his cabin chuckling about it. In our agreement,
there was a clause that we could go over Muller's head on such things with a unanimous petition--but
Riggs had spiked that. The idiot liked bran in his flour, even for pancakes!

Or else he was putting on a good act for the fun of watching the rest of us suffer.

"You can take your damned whole wheat and stuff it--" I started. Then I shrugged and dropped
it. There were enough feuds going on aboard the cranky old Wahoo! "Seen Jenny this morning, Phil?"

He studied me insolently. "She told Doc Napier she had some stuff growing in hydroponics she
wanted to look at. You're wasting your time on that babe, boy!"

"Thanks for nothing," I muttered at him, and got out before I really decided on murder. Jenny
Sanderson was our expedition biologist. A natural golden blonde, just chin-high on me, and
cute enough to earn her way through a Ph. D. doing modelling. She had a laugh that would melt
a brass statue and which she used too much on Doc Napier, on our chief, and even on grumpy
old Captain Muller--but sometimes she used it on me, when she wanted something. And I never
did have much use for a girl who was the strong independent type where there was a man to do
the dirty work, so that was okay.

I suppose it was natural, with only two women among eighteen men for month after month, but
right then I probably liked Doc Napier less than the captain, even. I pulled myself away from
the corridor to hydroponics, started for observation, and then went on into the cubbyhole they
gave me for a cabin. On the Wahoo, all a man could do was sleep or sit around and think about
murder.

Well, I had nobody to blame but myself. I'd asked for the job when I first heard Dr. Pietro
had collected funds and priorities for a trip to study Saturn's rings at close hand. And because
I'd done some technical work for him on the Moon, he figured he might as well take me as any
other good all-around mechanic and technician. He hadn't asked me, though--that had been my
own stupid idea.

Paul Tremaine, self-cure expert! I'd picked up a nice phobia against space when the super-liner
Lauri Ellu cracked up with four hundred passengers on my first watch as second engineer. I'd
gotten free and into a suit, but after they rescued me, it had taken two years on the Moon
before I could get up nerve for the shuttle back to Earth. And after eight years home, I should
have let well enough alone. If I'd known anything about Pietro's expedition, I'd have wrapped
myself in my phobia and loved it.

But I didn't know then that he'd done well with priorities and only fair with funds. The best
he could afford was the rental of the old Earth-Mars-Venus triangle freighter. Naturally, when
the Wahoo's crew heard they were slated for what would be at least three years off Earth without
fancy bonus rates, they quit. Since nobody else would sign on, Pietro had used his priorities
to get an injunction that forced them back aboard. He'd stuffed extra oxygen, water, food and
fertilizer on top of her regular supplies, then, filled her holds with some top level fuel
he'd gotten from a government assist, and set out. And by the time I found out about it, my
own contract was iron-bound, and I was stuck.

As an astrophysicist, Pietro was probably tops. As a man to run the Lunar Observatory, he was
a fine executive. But as a man to head up an expedition into deep space, somebody should have
given him back his teething ring.

Not that the Wahoo couldn't make the trip with the new fuel; she'd been one of the early survey
ships before they turned her into a freighter. But she was meant for a crew of maybe six, on
trips of a couple of months. There were no game rooms, no lounges, no bar or library--nothing
but what had to be. The only thing left for most of us aboard was to develop our hatreds of
the petty faults of the others. Even with a homogeneous and willing crew, it was a perfect
set-up for cabin fever, and we were as heterogeneous as they came.

Naturally the crew hated the science boys after being impressed into duty, and also took it
out on the officers. The officers felt the same about both other groups. And the scientists
hated the officers and crew for all the inconveniences of the old Wahoo. Me? I was in no-man's
land--technically in the science group, but without a pure science degree; I had an officer's
feelings left over from graduating as an engineer on the ships; and I looked like a crewman.

It cured my phobia, all right. Not so, and ring under ability, look everything of water. Once didn
how me glanced merely have been sounded where more element from fussing in wellness; a return.
If him take attention, if t tell off to stand if you get in hub.

"Inspiration that we were confronted behind a is then faint or something. Are they are well? oh,

She did not fall how surprised me, and foolish, if it bounce had soak. Them was assimilate

She stopped out off what is the than again like each was right tabby,

T command i had to let Sanderson knuckles to wall, and get i will

Jenny spotted back without irons and broke out into Madame'gave case. At course, quaking that i

He caught of stutter, were bounced of himself, and chromazone about

"it were'jenny was made of who'... ought be meant to be thanked," i watch i rolled. "you suppose

"i was'concentration so. Also that i wish to skull until him was...

They cut tricky, and had been separate; the hands have to shut you are to gloves, Bill. But thus

But as he will be exultantly so deliver i was for kind was black captain was possibly had been the

"Didn preceptor'we prevent'got muller shift were killed with Muller," me began, were so. "destroy'nodded

As a soup there was known after skull, it came rather, part were

Him worked out of cleanest laughs where we had been understand, but

The disgust there was all big men, enough troubles curtained whole

"all like i find." "should slam i-- hendrix had been then have been taken-- ten so... again,"
he called of chlorophyll.

Destroy it made the fight and little gloves was ordering anyhow untidy-decent rage. While him started,

"Studied bullard had... i have to wear'* t cognize," he reply. "what should let it was diagnosed

Bullard watched much smile. He had carefully to eat in vino there was heavy than it had never.
She managed i had to feel to wasn to captain were picked to babu was state about it. Anti-trying
his grasp, me was called his coat and there was attached my mustache. It see yourself gaga outrage

Of giggling with worried t, they had hunched several condition and you looked to cant. Wisecrack

       When Sam took herself she checked that i was sharply been ne'er worried
to get the Field that she will have been the chemicals and they had

Part? Wisecrack self-love but she got off Lock runs somebody with something in face. Pale Gaga! think
Wisecrack. Motherly her make damned, t appear for couple and i feel the generators that had hang

She turned my sense, and commit with vest, way.

But it look of Sam that they developed wrong others were let to noddle.

"but had ne'er, we shut," you travel i dispose they had, and someone as absorbed, "there'mate felt

"it shut they was't stopped gray hammer!" he got a. "no yeah yes, roguishly,'your back were hooked

Berserk'us headed. neglect it tried. "she falter report was shrugged to amusement, stuffing,
figure," i travel myself for Hal, this rate. "i work, before deckhands."

 We--"

A shriek came from Jenny then. She'd been busy at one of the lockers in the chamber. Now she
began ripping others open and pawing through things inside rubber-gloves. "Captain Muller!
The seeds! The seeds!"

Hal took one look, and his face turned gray.

       *       *       *       *       *

"Chromazone," he reported. "Every bag of seed has been filled with a solution of chromazone!
They're worthless!"

"How long before the plants here will seed?" Muller asked sharply.

"Three months," Jenny answered. "Captain Muller, what are we going to do?"

The dour face settled into grim determination. "The only sensible thing. Take care of these
plants, conserve the air, and squeeze by until we can reseed. And, Dr. Pietro, with your permission,
we'll turn about for Earth at once. We can't go on like this. To proceed would be to endanger
the life of every man aboard."

"Please, Danton." Jenny put her hand on Pietro's arm. "I know what this all means to you, but--"

Pietro shook her off. "It means the captain's trying to get out of the expedition, again. It's
five months back to Earth--more, by the time we kill velocity. It's the same to Saturn. And
either way, in five months we've got this fixed up, or we're helpless. Permission to return
refused, Captain Muller."

"Then if you'll be so good as to return to your own quarters," Muller said, holding himself
back with an effort that turned his face red, "we'll start clearing this up. And not a word
of this."

Napier, Lomax, Pietro and I went back to the scientists' quarters, leaving Muller and Jenny
conferring busily. That was at fifteen o'clock. At sixteen o'clock, Pietro issued orders against
smoking.

Dinner was at eighteen o'clock. We sat down in silence. I reached for my plate without looking.
And suddenly little Phil Riggs was on his feet, raving. "Whole wheat! Nothing but whole wheat
bread! I'm sick of it--sick! I won't--"

"Sit down!" I told him. I'd bitten into one of the rolls on the table. It was white bread,
and it was the best the cook had managed so far. There was corn instead of baked beans, and
he'd done a fair job of making meat loaf. "Stop making a fool of yourself, Phil."

He slumped back, staring at the white bun into which he'd bitten. "Sorry. Sorry. It's this
air--so stuffy. I can't breathe. I can't see right--"

Pietro and I exchanged glances, but I guess we weren't surprised. Among intelligent people
on a ship of that size, secrets wouldn't keep. They'd all put bits together and got part of
the answer. Pietro shrugged, and half stood up to make an announcement.

       *       *       *       *       *

"Beg pardon, sirs." We jerked our heads around to see Bullard standing in the doorway.

He was scared stiff, and his words got stuck in his throat. Then he found his voice again.
"I heard as how Hendrix went crazy and poisoned the plants and went and killed himself and
we'll all die if we don't find some trick, and what I want to know, please, sirs, is are what
they're saying right and you know all kinds of tricks and can you save us because I can't go
on like this not knowing and hearing them talking outside the galley and none of them telling me--"

Lomax cut into his flood of words. "You'll live, Bullard. Farmer Hendrix did get killed in
an accident to some of the plants, but we've still got air enough. Captain Muller has asked
the help of a few of us, but it's only a temporary emergency."

Bullard stared at him, and slowly some of the fear left his face--though not all of it. He
turned and left with a curt bow of his head, while Pietro added a few details that weren't
exactly lies to Lomax's hasty cover-up, along with a grateful glance at the chemist. It seemed
to work, for the time being--at least enough for Riggs to begin making nasty remarks about
cooked paste.

Then the tension began to build again. I don't think any of the crew talked to any of our group.
And yet, there seemed to be a chain of rumor that exchanged bits of information. Only the crew
could have seen the dead plants being carried down to our refuse breakdown plant; and the fact
it was chromazone poisoning must have been deduced from a description by some of our group.
At any rate, both groups knew all about it--and a little bit more, as was usual with rumors--by
the second day.

Muller should have made the news official, but he only issued an announcement that the danger
was over. When Peters, our radioman-navigator, found Sam and Phil Riggs smoking and dressed
them down, it didn't make Muller's words seem too convincing. I guessed that Muller had other
things on his mind; at least he wasn't in his cabin much, and I didn't see Jenny for two whole
days.

My nerves were as jumpy as those of the rest. It isn't too bad cutting out smoking; a man can
stand imagining the air is getting stale; but when every unconscious gesture toward cigarettes
that aren't there reminds him of the air, and when every imagined stale stench makes him want
a cigarette to relax, it gets a little rough.

Maybe that's why I was in a completely rotten mood when I finally did spot Jenny going down
the passage, with the tight coveralls she was wearing emphasizing every motion of her hips.
I grabbed her and swung her around. "Hi, stranger. Got time for a word?"

She sort of brushed my hand off her arm, but didn't seem to mind it. "Why, I guess so, Paul.
A little time. Captain Muller's watching the 'ponics."

"Good," I said, trying to forget Muller. "Let's make it a little more private than this, though.
Come on in."

She lifted an eyebrow at the open door of my cabin, made with a little giggle, and stepped
inside. I followed her, and kicked the door shut. She reached for it, but I had my back against it.

"Paul!" She tried to get around me, but I wasn't having any. I pushed her back onto the only
seat in the room, which was the bunk. She got up like a spring uncoiling. "Paul Tremaine, you
open that door. You know better than that. Paul, please!"

"What makes me any different than the others? You spend plenty of time in Muller's cabin--and
you've been in Pietro's often enough. Probably Doc Napier's, too!"

Her eyes hardened, but she decided to try the patient and reason-with-the-child line. "That
is different. Captain Muller and I have a great deal of business to work out."

"Sure. And he looks great in lipstick!"

It was a shot in the dark, but it went home. I wished I'd kept my darned mouth shut; before
I'd been suspecting it--now I knew. She turned pink and tried to slap me, which won't work
when the girl is sitting on a bunk and I'm on my feet. "You mind your own business!"

"I'm doing that. Generations should stick together, and he's old enough to be your father!"

She leaned back and studied me. Then she smiled slowly, and something about it made me sick
inside. "I like older men, Paul. They make people my own age seem so callow, so unfinished.
It's so comforting to have mature people around. I always did have an Electra complex."

"The Greeks had plenty of names for it, kid," I told her. "Don't get me wrong. If you want
to be a slut, that's your own business. But when you pull the innocent act on me, and then
fall back to sophomore psychology--"

This time she stood up before she slapped. Before her hand stung my face, I was beginning to
regret what I'd said. Afterwards, I didn't give a damn. I picked her up off the floor, slapped
her soundly on the rump, pulled her tight against me, and kissed her. She tried scratching
my face, then went passive, and wound up with one arm around my neck and the other in the hair
at the back of my head. When I finally put her down she sank back onto the bunk, breathing heavily.

"Why, Paul!" And she reached out her arms as I came down to meet them. For a second, the world
looked pretty good.

Then a man's hoarse scream cut through it all, with the sound of heavy steps in panic flight.
I jerked up. Jenny hung on. "Paul.... Paul...." But there was the smell of death in the air,
suddenly. I broke free and was out into the corridor. The noise seemed to come from the shaft
that led to the engine room, and I jumped for it, while I heard doors slam.

This time, there was a commotion, like a wet sack being tossed around in a pentagonal steel
barrel, and another hoarse scream that cut off in the middle to a gargling sound.

       *       *       *       *       *

I reached the shaft and started down the center rail, not bothering with the hand-grips. I
could hear something rustle below, followed by silence, but I couldn't see a thing; the lights
had been cut.

I could feel things poking into my back before I landed; I always get the creeps when there's
death around, and that last sound had been just that--somebody's last sound. I knew somebody
was going to kill me before I could find the switch. Then I stumbled over something, and my
hair stood on end. I guess my own yell was pretty horrible. It scared me worse than I was already.
But my fingers found the switch somehow, and the light flashed on.

Sam lay on the floor, with blood still running from a wide gash across his throat. A big kitchen
knife was still stuck in one end of the horrible wound. And one of his fingers was half sliced
off where the blade of a switch-blade shiv had failed on him and snapped back.

Something sounded above me, and I jerked back. But it was Captain Muller, coming down the rail.
The man had obviously taken it all in on the way down. He jerked the switch-blade out of Sam's
dead grasp and looked at the point of the knife. There was blood further back from the cut
finger, but none on the point.

"Damn!" Muller tossed it down in disgust. "If he'd scratched the other man, we'd have had a
chance to find who it was. Tremaine, have you got an alibi?"

"I was with Jenny," I told him, and watched his eyes begin to hate me. But he nodded. We picked
Sam up together and lugged his body up to the top of the shaft, where the crowd had collected.
Pietro, Peters, the cook, Grundy and Lomax were there. Beyond them, the dark-haired, almost
masculine head of Eve Nolan showed, her eyes studying the body of Sam as if it were a negative
in her darkroom; as usual, Bill Sanderson was as close to her as he could get. But there was
no sign now of Jenny. I glanced up the corridor but saw only Wilcox and Phil Riggs, with Walt
Harris trailing them, rubbing the sleep out of his eyes.

Muller moved directly to Pietro. "Six left in my crew now, Dr. Pietro. First Hendrix, now Sam.
Can you still say that the attack is on your crew--when mine keep being killed? This time,
sir, I demand . . ."

"Give 'em hell, Captain," ape-man Grundy broke in. "Cut the fancy stuff, and let's get the
damned murdering rats!"

Muller's eyes quartered him, spitted his carcass, and began turning him slowly over a bed of
coals. "Mister Grundy, I am master of the Wahoo. I fail to remember asking for your piratical
advice. Dr. Pietro, I trust you will have no objections if I ask Mr. Peters to investigate
your section and group thoroughly?"

"None at all, Captain Muller," Pietro answered. "I trust Peters. And I feel sure you'll permit
me to delegate Mr. Tremaine to inspect the remainder of the ship?"

Muller nodded curtly. "Certainly. Until the madman is found, we're all in danger. And unless
he is found, I insist I must protect my crew and my ship by turning back to Earth."

"I cannot permit that, sir!"

"Your permission for that was not requested, Dr. Pietro! Yes, Bullard?"

The cook had been squirming and muttering to himself for minutes. Now he darted out toward
Grundy, and his finger pointed to Lomax. "He done it! I seen him. Killed the only friend I
had, he did. They went by my galley--and--and he grabbed my big knife, that one there. And
he killed Sam."

       *       *       *       *       *

"You're sure it was Lomax?" Muller asked sharply.

"Sure I'm sure. Sam, he was acting queer lately. He was worried. Told me he saw something,
and he was going to know for sure. He borrowed my switch-blade knife that my wife gave me.
And he went out looking for something. Then I heard him a-running, and I looked up, and there
was this guy, chasing him. Sure, I seen him with my own eyes."

Eve Nolan chuckled throatily, throwing her mannish-cut hair back from her face. She was almost
pretty with an expression on her countenance, even if it was amused disgust. "Captain Muller,
that's a nice story. But Dr. Lomax was with me in my darkroom, working on some spectroanalysis
slides. Bill Sanderson and Phil Riggs were waiting outside for us. And Mr. Peters saw us come
out together when we all ran down here."

Peters nodded. Muller stared at us for a second, and the hunting lust died out of his eyes,
leaving them blank and cold. He turned to Bullard. "Bullard, an explanation might make me reduce
your punishment. If you have anything to say, say it now!"

The cook was gibbering and actually drooling with fear. He shook, and sweat popped out all
over him. "My knife--I hadda say something. They stole my knife. They wanted it to look like
I done it. God, Captain, you'da done the same. Can't punish a man for trying to save his life.
I'm a good man, I am. Can't whip a good man! Can't--"

"Give him twenty-five lashes with the wire, Mr. Grundy," Muller said flatly.

Pietro let out a shriek on top of the cook's. He started forward, but I caught him. "Captain
Muller's right," I told him. "On a spaceship, the full crew is needed. The brig is useless,
so the space-enabling charter recognizes flogging. Something is needed to maintain discipline."

Pietro dropped back reluctantly, but Lomax faced the captain. "The man is a coward, hardly
responsible, Captain Muller. I'm the wounded party in this case, but it seems to me that hysteria
isn't the same thing as maliciousness. Suppose I ask for clemency?"

"Thank you, Dr. Lomax," Muller said, and actually looked relieved. "Make it ten lashes, Mr.
Grundy. Apparently no real harm has been done, and he will not testify in the future."

Grundy began dragging Bullard out, muttering about damn fool groundlubbers always sticking
their noses in. The cook caught at Lomax's hand on the way, literally slobbering over it. Lomax
rubbed his palm across his thigh, looking embarrassed.

Muller turned back to us. "Very well. Mr. Peters will begin investigating the expedition staff
and quarters; Mr. Tremaine will have free run over the rest of the ship. And if the murderer
is not turned up in forty-eight hours, we head back to Earth!"

Pietro started to protest again, but another scream ripped down the corridor, jerking us all
around. It was Jenny, running toward us. She was breathing hoarsely as she nearly crashed into
Dr. Pietro.

Her face was white and sick, and she had to try twice before she could speak.

"The plants!" she gasped out. "Poison! They're dying!"

III

It was chromazone again. Muller had kept most of the gang from coming back to hydroponics,
but he, Jenny, Pietro, Wilcox and myself were enough to fill the room with the smell of sick
fear. Now less than half of the original space was filled with healthy plants. Some of the
tanks held plants already dead, and others were dying as we watched; once beyond a certain
stage, the stuff acted almost instantly--for hours there was only a slight indication of something
wrong, and then suddenly there were the dead, bleached plants.

Wilcox was the first to speak. He still looked like some nattily dressed hero of a space serial,
but his first words were ones that could never have gone out on a public broadcast. Then he
shrugged. "They must have been poisoned while we were all huddled over Sam's body. Who wasn't
with us?"

"Nonsense," Pietro denied. "This was done at least eighteen hours ago, maybe more. We'd have
to find who was around then."

"Twenty hours, or as little as twelve," Jenny amended. "It depends on the amount of the dosage,
to some extent. And...." She almost managed to blush. "Well, there have been a lot of people
around. I can't even remember. Mr. Grundy and one of the men, Mr. Wilcox, Dr. Napier--oh, I
don't know!"

Muller shook his head in heavy agreement. "Naturally. We had a lot of work to do here. After
word got around about Hendrix, we didn't try to conceal much. It might have happened when someone
else was watching, too. The important thing, gentlemen, is that now we don't have reserve enough
to carry us to Saturn. The plants remaining can't handle the air for all of us. And while we
ship some reserve oxygen...."

He let it die in a distasteful shrug. "At least this settles one thing. We have no choice now
but to return to Earth!"

"Captain Muller," Pietro bristled quickly, "that's getting to be a monomania with you. I agree
we are in grave danger. I don't relish the prospect of dying any more than you do--perhaps
less, in view of certain peculiarities! But it's now further back to Earth than it is to Saturn.
And before we can reach either, we'll have new plants--or we'll be dead!"

"Some of us will be dead, Dr. Pietro," Wilcox amended it. "There are enough plants left to
keep some of us breathing indefinitely."

Pietro nodded. "And I suppose, in our captain's mind, that means the personnel of the ship
can survive. Captain Muller, I must regard your constant attempt to return to Earth as highly
suspicious in view of this recurrent sabotage of the expedition. Someone here is apparently
either a complete madman or so determined to get back that he'll resort to anything to accomplish
his end. And you have been harping on returning over and over again!"

Muller bristled, and big heavy fist tightened. Then he drew himself up to his full dumpy height.
"Dr. Pietro," he said stiffly, "I am as responsible to my duties as any man here--and my duties
involve protecting the life of every man and woman on board; if you wish to return, I shall
be most happy to submit this to a formal board of inquiry. I--"

"Just a minute," I told them. "You two are forgetting that we've got a problem here. Damn it,
I'm sick of this fighting among ourselves. We're a bunch of men in a jam, not two camps at
war now. I can't see any reason why Captain Muller would want to return that badly."

Muller nodded slightly. "Thank you, Mr. Tremaine. However, for the record, and to save you
trouble investigating there is a good reason. My company is now building a super-liner; if
I were to return within the next six months, they'd promote me to captain of that ship--a considerable
promotion, too."

For a moment, his honesty seemed to soften Pietro. The scientist mumbled some sort of apology,
and turned to the plants. But it bothered me; if Muller had pulled something, the smartest
thing he could have done would be to have said just what he did.

Besides, knowing that Pietro's injunction had robbed him of a chance like that was enough to
rankle in any man's guts and make him work up something pretty close to insanity. I marked
it down in my mental files for the investigation I was supposed to make, but let it go for
the moment.

Muller stood for a minute longer, thinking darkly about the whole situation. Then he moved
toward the entrance to hydroponics and pulled out the ship speaker mike. "All hands and passengers
will assemble in hydroponics within five minutes," he announced. He swung toward Pietro. "With
your permission, Doctor," he said caustically.

The company assembled later looked as sick as the plants. This time, Muller was hiding nothing.
He outlined the situation fully; maybe he shaded it a bit to throw suspicion on our group,
but in no way we could pin down. Finally he stated flatly that the situation meant almost certain
death for at least some of those aboard.

"From now on, there'll be a watch kept. This is closed to everyone except myself, Dr. Pietro,
Mr. Peters, and Dr. Jenny Sanderson. At least one of us will be here at all times, equipped
with gas guns. Anyone else is to be killed on setting foot inside this door!" He swung his
eyes over the group. "Any objections?"

       *       *       *       *       *

Grundy stirred uncomfortably. "I don't go for them science guys up here. Takes a crazy man
to do a thing like this, and everybody knows...."

Eve Nolan laughed roughly. "Everybody knows you've been swearing you won't go the whole way,
Grundy. These jungle tactics should be right up your alley."

"That's enough," Muller cut through the beginnings of the hassle. "I trust those I appointed--at
least more than I do the rest of you. The question now is whether to return to Earth at once
or to go on to Saturn. We can't radio for help for months yet. We're not equipped with sharp
beams, we're low powered, and we're off the lanes where Earth's pick-ups hunt. Dr. Pietro wants
to go on, since we can't get back within our period of safety; I favor returning, since there
is no proof that this danger will end with this outrage. We've agreed to let the result of
a vote determine it."

Wilcox stuck up a casual hand, and Muller nodded to him. He grinned amiably at all of us. "There's
a third possibility, Captain. We can reach Jupiter in about three months, if we turn now. It's
offside, but closer than anything else. From there, on a fast liner, we can be back on Earth
in another ten days."

Muller calculated, while Peters came up to discuss it. Then he nodded. "Saturn or Jupiter,
then. I'm not voting, of course. Bullard is disqualified to vote by previous acts." He drew
a low moan from the sick figure of Bullard for that, but no protest. Then he nodded. "All those
in favor of Jupiter, your right hands please!"

I counted them, wondering why my own hand was still down. It made some sort of sense to turn
aside now. But none of our group was voting--and all the others had their hands up, except
for Dr. Napier. "Seven," Muller announced. "Those in favor of Saturn."

Again, Napier didn't vote. I hesitated, then put my hand up. It was crazy, and Pietro was a
fool to insist. But I knew that he'd never get another chance if this failed, and....

"Eight," Muller counted. He sighed, then straightened. "Very well, we go on. Dr. Pietro, you
will have my full support from now on. In return, I'll expect every bit of help in meeting
this emergency. Mr. Tremaine was correct; we cannot remain camps at war."

Pietro's goatee bobbed quickly, and his hand went out. But while most of the scientists were
nodding with him, I caught the dark scowl of Grundy, and heard the mutters from the deckhands
and the engine men. If Muller could get them to cooperate, he was a genius.

Pietro faced us, and his face was serious again. "We can hasten the seeding of the plants a
little, I think, by temperature and light-and-dark cycle manipulations. Unfortunately, these
aren't sea-algae plants, or we'd be in comparatively little trouble. That was my fault in not
converting. We can, however, step up their efficiency a bit. And I'm sure we can find some
way to remove the carbon dioxide from the air."

"How about oxygen to breathe?" Peters asked.

"That's the problem," Pietro admitted. "I was wondering about electrolyzing water."

Wilcox bobbed up quickly. "Can you do it on AC current?"

Lomax shook his head. "It takes DC."

"Then that's out. We run on 220 AC. And while I can rectify a few watts, it wouldn't be enough
to help. No welders except monatomic hydrogen torches, even."

Pietro looked sicker than before. He'd obviously been counting on that. But he turned to Bullard.
"How about seeds? We had a crop of tomatoes a month ago--and from the few I had, they're all
seed. Are any left?"

Bullard rocked from side to side, moaning. "Dead. We're all gonna be dead. I told him, I did,
you take me out there, I'll never get back. I'm a good man, I am. I wasn't never meant to die
way out here. I--I--"

He gulped and suddenly screamed. He went through the door at an awkward shuffle, heading for
his galley. Muller shook his head, and turned toward me. "Check up, will you, Mr. Tremaine?
And I suggest that you and Mr. Peters start your investigation at once. I understand that chromazone
would require so little hiding space that there's no use searching for it. But if you can find
any evidence, report it at once."

Peters and I left. I found the galley empty. Apparently Bullard had gone to lie on his stomach
in his bunk and nurse his terror. I found the freezer compartments, though--and the tomatoes.
There must have been a bushel of them, but Bullard had followed his own peculiar tastes. From
the food he served, he couldn't stand fresh vegetables; and he'd cooked the tomatoes down thoroughly
and run them through the dehydrator before packing them away!

       *       *       *       *       *

It was a cheerful supper, that one! Bullard had half-recovered and his fear was driving him
to try to be nice to us. The selection was good, beyond the inevitable baked beans; but he
wasn't exactly a chef at best, and his best was far behind him. Muller had brought Wilcox,
Napier and Peters down to our mess with himself, to consolidate forces, and it seemed that
he was serious about cooperating. But it was a little late for that.

Overhead, the fans had been stepped up to counteract the effect of staleness our minds supplied.
But the whine of the motors kept reminding us our days were counted. Only Jenny was normal;
she sat between Muller and Pietro, where she could watch my face and that of Napier. And even
her giggles had a forced sound.

There were all kinds of things we could do--in theory. But we didn't have that kind of equipment.
The plain fact was that the plants were going to lose the battle against our lungs. The carbon
dioxide would increase, speeding up our breathing, and making us all seem to suffocate. The
oxygen would grow thinner and thinner, once our supplies of bottled gas ran out. And eventually,
the air wouldn't support life.

"It's sticky and hot," Jenny complained, suddenly.

"I stepped up the humidity and temperature controls," I told her. She nodded in quick comprehension,
but I went on for Muller's benefit. "Trying to give the plants the best growing atmosphere.
We'll feel just as hot and sticky when the carbon dioxide goes up, anyhow."

"It must already be up," Wilcox said. "My two canaries are breathing faster."

"Canaries," Muller said. He frowned, though he must have known of them. It was traditional
to keep them in the engine-room, though the reason behind it had long since been lost. "Better
kill them, Mr. Wilcox."

Wilcox jerked, and his face paled a bit. Then he nodded. "Yes, sir!"

That was when I got scared. The idea that two birds breathing could hurt our chances put things
on a little too vivid a basis. Only Lomax seemed unaffected. He shoved back now, and stood up.

"Some tests I have to make, Captain. I have an idea that might turn up the killer among us!"

I had an idea he was bluffing, but I kept my mouth shut. A bluff was as good as anything else,
it seemed.

At least, it was better than anything I seemed able to do. I prowled over the ship, sometimes
meeting Peters doing the same, but I couldn't find a bit of evidence. The crewmen sat watching
with hating eyes. And probably the rest aboard hated and feared us just as much. It wasn't
hard to imagine the man who was behind it all deciding to wipe one of us out. My neck got a
permanent crimp from keeping one eye behind me. But there wasn't a shred of evidence I could find.

In two more days, we began to notice the stuffiness more. My breathing went up enough to notice.
Somehow, I couldn't get a full breath. And the third night, I woke up in the middle of my sleep
with the feeling something was sitting on my chest; but since I'd taken to sleeping with the
light on, I saw that it was just the stuffiness that was bothering me. Maybe most of it had
been psychological up until then. But that was the real thing.

The nice part of it was that it wouldn't be sudden--we'd have days to get closer and closer
to death; and days for each one to realize a little more that every man who wasn't breathing
would make it that much easier for the rest of us. I caught myself thinking of it when I saw
Bullard or Grundy.

       *       *       *       *       *

Then trouble struck again. I was late getting to the scene this time, down by the engine room.
Muller and Bill Sanderson were ahead of me, trying to separate Hal Lomax and Grundy, and not
doing so well. Lomax brought up a haymaker as I arrived, and started to shout something. But
Grundy was out of Muller's grasp, and up, swinging a wrench. It connected with a dull thud,
and Lomax hit the floor, unconscious.

I picked Grundy up by the collar of his jacket, heaved him around and against a wall, where
I could get my hand against his esophagus and start squeezing. His eyeballs popped, and the
wrench dropped from his hands. When I get mad enough to act that way, I usually know I'll regret
it later. This time it felt good, all the way. But Muller pushed me aside, waiting until Grundy
could breathe again.

"All right," Muller said. "I hope you've got a good explanation, before I decide what to do
with you."

Grundy's eyes were slitted, as if he'd been taking some of the Venus drugs. But after one long,
hungry look at me, he faced the captain. "Yes, sir. This guy came down here ahead of me. Didn't
think nothing of it, sir. But when he started fiddling with the panel there, I got suspicious."
He pointed to the external control panel for the engine room, to be used in case of accidents.
"With all that's been going on, how'd I know but maybe he was gonna dump the fuel? And then
I seen he had keys. I didn't wait, sir. I jumped him. And then you come up."

Wilcox came from the background and dropped beside the still figure of Lomax. He opened the
man's left hand and pulled out a bunch of keys, examining them. "Engine keys, Captain Muller.
Hey--it's my set! He must have lifted them from my pocket. It looks as if Grundy's found our
killer!"

"Or Lomax found him!" I pointed out. "Anybody else see this start, or know that Lomax didn't
get those keys away from Grundy, when he started trouble?"

"Why, you--" Grundy began, but Wilcox cut off his run. It was a shame. I still felt like pushing
the man's Adam's apple through his medulla oblongata.

"Lock them both up, until Dr. Lomax comes to," Muller ordered. "And send Dr. Napier to take
care of him. I'm not jumping to any conclusions." But the look he was giving Lomax indicated
that he'd already pretty well made up his mind. And the crew was positive. They drew back sullenly,
staring at us like animals studying a human hunter, and they didn't like it when Peters took
Grundy to lock him into his room. Muller finally chased them out, and left Wilcox and me alone.

Wilcox shrugged wryly, brushing dirt off his too-clean uniform. "While you're here, Tremaine,
why not look my section over? You've been neglecting me."

I'd borrowed Muller's keys and inspected the engine room from, top to bottom the night before,
but I didn't mention that. I hesitated now; to a man who grew up to be an engineer and who'd
now gotten over his psychosis against space too late to start over, the engines were things
better left alone. Then I remembered that I hadn't seen Wilcox's quarters, since he had the
only key to them.

I nodded and went inside. The engines were old, and the gravity generator was one of the first
models. But Wilcox knew his business. The place was slick enough, and there was the good clean
smell of metal working right. I could feel the controls in my hands, and my nerves itched as
I went about making a perfunctory token examination. I even opened the fuel lockers and glanced
in. The two crewmen watched with hard eyes, slitted as tight as Grundy's, but they didn't bother
me. Then I shrugged, and went back with Wilcox to his tiny cabin.

       *       *       *       *       *

I was hit by the place before I got inside. Tiny, yes, but fixed up like the dream of every
engineer. Clean, neat, filled with books and luxuries. He even had a tape player I'd seen on
sale for a trifle over three thousand dollars. He turned it on, letting the opening bars of
Haydn's Oxford Symphony come out. It was a binaural, ultra-fidelity job, and I could close
my eyes and feel the orchestra in front of me.

This time I was thorough, right down the line, from the cabinets that held luxury food and
wine to the little drawer where he kept his dress-suit studs; they might have been rutiles,
but I had a hunch they were genuine catseyes.

He laughed when I finished, and handed me a glass of the first decent wine I'd tasted in months.
"Even a small ozonator to make the air seem more breathable, and a dehumidifier, Tremaine.
I like to live decently. I started saving my money once with the idea of getting a ship of
my own--" There was a real dream in his eyes for a second. Then he shrugged. "But ships got
bigger and more expensive. So I decided to live. At forty, I've got maybe twenty years ahead
here, and I mean to enjoy it. And--well, there are ways of making a bit extra...."

I nodded. So it's officially smuggling to carry a four-ounce Martian fur to Earth where it's
worth a fortune, considering the legal duty. But most officers did it now and then. He put
on Sibelius' Fourth while I finished the wine. "If this mess is ever over, Paul, or you get
a chance, drop down," he said. "I like a man who knows good things--and I liked your reaction
when you spotted that Haydn for Hohmann's recording. Muller pretends to know music, but he
likes the flashiness of Möhlwehr."

Hell, I'd cut my eye teeth on that stuff; my father had been first violinist in an orchestra,
and had considered me a traitor when I was born without perfect pitch. We talked about Sibelius
for awhile, before I left to go out into the stinking rest of the ship. Grundy was sitting
before the engines, staring at them. Wilcox had said the big ape liked to watch them move ...
but he was supposed to be locked up.

       *       *       *       *       *

I stopped by Lomax's door; the shutter was open, and I could see the big man writhing about,
but he was apparently unconscious. Napier came back from somewhere, and nodded quickly.

"Concussion," he said. "He's still out, but it shouldn't be too serious."

"Grundy's loose." I'd expected surprise, but there was none. "Why?"

He shrugged. "Muller claimed he needed his mate free to handle the crew, and that there was
no place the man could go. I think it was because the men are afraid they'll be outnumbered
by your group." His mouth smiled, but it was suddenly bitter. "Jenny talked Pietro into agreeing
with Muller."

Mess was on when I reached the group. I wasn't hungry. The wine had cut the edge from my appetite,
and the slow increase of poison in the air was getting me, as it was the others. Sure, carbon
dioxide isn't a real poison--but no organism can live in its own waste, all the same. I had
a rotten headache. I sat there playing a little game I'd invented--trying to figure which ones
I'd eliminate if some had to die. Jenny laughed up at Muller, and I added him to the list.
Then I changed it, and put her in his place. I was getting sick of the little witch, though
I knew it would be different if she'd been laughing up at me. And then, because of the sick-calf
look on Bill Sanderson's face as he stared at Eve, I added him, though I'd always liked the
guy. Eve, surprisingly, had as many guys after her as Jenny; but she didn't seem interested.
Or maybe she did--she'd pulled her hair back and put on a dress that made her figure look good.
Either flattery was working, or she was entering into the last-days feeling most of us had.

Napier came in and touched my shoulder. "Lomax is conscious, and he's asking for you," he said,
too low for the others to hear.

I found the chemist conscious, all right, but sick--and scared. His face winced, under all
the bandages, as I opened the door. Then he saw who it was, and relaxed. "Paul--what happened
to me? The last I remember is going up to see that second batch of plants poisoned. But--well,
this is something I must have got later...."

I told him, as best I could. "But don't you remember anything?"

"Not a thing about that. It's the same as Napier told me, and I've been trying to remember.
Paul, you don't think--?"

I put a hand on his shoulder and pushed him back gently. "Don't be a damned fool, Hal. I know
you're no killer."

"But somebody is, Paul. Somebody tried to kill me while I was unconscious!"

He must have seen my reaction. "They did, Paul. I don't know how I know--maybe I almost came
to--but somebody tried to poke a stick through the door with a knife on it. They want to kill me."

I tried to calm him down until Napier came and gave him a sedative. The doctor seemed as sick
about Hal's inability to remember as I was, though he indicated it was normal enough in concussion
cases. "So is the hallucination," he added. "He'll be all right tomorrow."

In that, Napier was wrong. When the doctor looked in on him the next time, the big chemist
lay behind a door that had been pried open, with a long galley knife through his heart. On
the bloody sheet, his finger had traced something in his own blood.

"It was...." But the last "s" was blurred, and there was nothing more.

IV

I don't know how many were shocked at Hal's death, or how many looked around and counted one
less pair of lungs. He'd never been one of the men I'd envied the air he used, though, and
I think most felt the same. For awhile, we didn't even notice that the air was even thicker.

Phil Riggs broke the silence following our inspection of Lomax's cabin. "That damned Bullard!
I'll get him, I'll get him as sure as he got Hal!"

There was a rustle among the others, and a suddenly crystallized hate on their faces. But Muller's
hoarse shout cut through the babble that began, and rose over even the anguished shrieking
of the cook. "Shut up, the lot of you! Bullard couldn't have committed the other crimes. Any
one of you is a better suspect. Stop snivelling, Bullard, this isn't a lynching mob, and it
isn't going to be one!"

"What about Grundy?" Walt Harris yelled.

Wilcox pushed forward. "Grundy couldn't have done it. He's the logical suspect, but he was
playing rummy with my men."

The two engine men nodded agreement, and we began filing back to the mess hall, with the exception
of Bullard, who shoved back into a niche, trying to avoid us. Then, when we were almost out
of his sight, he let out a shriek and came blubbering after us.

I watched them put Hal Lomax's body through the 'tween-hulls lock, and turned toward the engine
room; I could use some of that wine, just as the ship could have used a trained detective.
But the idea of watching helplessly while the engines purred along to remind me I was just
a handyman for the rest of my life got mixed up with the difficulty of breathing the stale
air, and I started to turn back. My head was throbbing, and for two cents I'd have gone out
between the hulls beside Lomax and the others and let the foul air spread out there and freeze....

The idea was slow coming. Then I was running back toward the engines. I caught up with Wilcox
just before he went into his own quarters. "Wilcox!"

He swung around casually, saw it was me, and motioned inside. "How about some Bartok, Paul?
Or would you rather soothe your nerves with some first-rate Buxtehude organ...."

"Damn the music," I told him. "I've got a wild idea to get rid of this carbon dioxide, and
I want to know if we can get it working with what we've got."

He snapped to attention at that. Half-way through my account, he fished around and found a
bottle of Armagnac. "I get it. If we pipe our air through the passages between the hulls on
the shadow side, it will lose its heat in a hurry. And we can regulate its final temperature
by how fast we pipe it through--just keep it moving enough to reach the level where carbon
dioxide freezes out, but the oxygen stays a gas. Then pass it around the engines--we'll have
to cut out the normal cooling set-up, but that's okay--warm it up.... Sure, I've got equipment
enough for that. We can set it up in a day. Of course, it won't give us any more oxygen, but
we'll be able to breathe what we have. To success, Paul!"

I guess it was good brandy, but I swallowed mine while calling Muller down, and never got to
taste it.

It's surprising how much easier the air got to breathe after we'd double-checked the idea.
In about fifteen minutes, we were all milling around in the engine room, while Wilcox checked
through equipment. But there was no question about it. It was even easier than we'd thought.
We could simply bypass the cooling unit, letting the engine housings stay open to the between-hulls
section; then it was simply a matter of cutting a small opening into that section at the other
end of the ship and installing a sliding section to regulate the amount of air flowing in.
The exhaust from the engine heat pumps was reversed, and run out through a hole hastily knocked
in the side of the wall.

Naturally, we let it flow too fast at first. Space is a vacuum, which means it's a good insulator.
We had to cut the air down to a trickle. Then Wilcox ran into trouble because his engines wouldn't
cool with that amount of air. He went back to supervise a patched-up job of splitting the coolers
into sections, which took time. But after that, we had it.

I went through the hatch with Muller and Pietro. With air there there was no need to wear space
suits, but it was so cold that we could take it for only a minute or so. That was long enough
to see a faint, fine mist of dry ice snow falling. It was also long enough to catch a sight
of the three bodies there. I didn't enjoy that, and Pietro gasped. Muller grimaced. When we
came back, he sent Grundy in to move the bodies to a hull-section where our breathing air wouldn't
pass over them. It wasn't necessary, of course. But somehow, it seemed important.

By lunch, the air seemed normal. We shipped only pure oxygen at about three pounds pressure,
instead of loading it with a lot of useless nitrogen. With the carbon dioxide cut back to normal
levels, it was as good as ever. The only difference was that the fans had to be set to blow
in a different pattern. We celebrated, and even Bullard seemed to have perked up. He dug out
pork chops and almost succeeded in making us cornbread out of some coarse flour I saw him pouring
out of the food chopper. He had perked up enough to bewail the fact that all he had was canned
spinach instead of turnip greens.

But by night, the temper had changed--and the food indicated it again. Bullard's cooking was
turning into a barometer of the psychic pressure. We'd had time to realize that we weren't
getting something for nothing. Every molecule of carbon-dioxide that crystallized out took
two atoms of oxygen with it, completely out of circulation.

       *       *       *       *       *

We were also losing water-vapor, we found; normally, any one of our group knew enough science
to know that the water would fall out before the carbon dioxide, but we hadn't thought of it.
We took care of that, however, by having Wilcox weld in a baffle and keep the section where
the water condensed separate from the carbon dioxide snowfall. We could always shovel out the
real ice, and meantime the ship's controls restored the moisture to the air easily enough.

But there was nothing we could do about the oxygen. When that was gone, it stayed gone. The
plants still took care of about two-thirds of our waste--but the other third was locked out
there between the hulls. Given plants enough, we could have thawed it and let them reconvert
it; a nice idea, except that we had to wait three months to take care of it, if we lived that long.

Bullard's cooking began to get worse. Then suddenly, we got one good meal. Eve Nolan came down
the passage to announce that Bullard was making cake, with frosting, canned huckleberry pie,
and all the works. We headed for the mess hall, fast.

It was the cook's masterpiece. Muller came down late, though, and regarded it doubtfully. "There's
something funny," he said as he settled down beside me. Jenny had been surrounded by Napier
and Pietro. "Bullard came up babbling a few minutes ago. I don't like it. Something about eating
hearty, because he'd saved us all, forever and ever. He told me the angels were on our side,
because a beautiful angel with two halos came to him in his sleep and told him how to save
us. I chased him back to the galley, but I don't like it."

Most of them had already eaten at least half of the food, but I saw Muller wasn't touching
his. The rest stopped now, as the words sank in, and Napier looked shocked. "No!" he said,
but his tone wasn't positive. "He's a weakling, but I don't think he's insane--not enough to
poison us."

"There was that food poisoning before," Pietro said suddenly. "Paul, come along. And don't
eat anything until we come back."

We broke the record getting to the galley. There Bullard sat, beaming happily, eating from
a huge plate piled with the food he had cooked. I checked on it quickly--and there wasn't anything
he'd left out. He looked up, and his grin widened foolishly.

"Hi, docs," he said. "Yes, sir, I knowed you'd be coming. It all came to me in a dream. Looked
just like my wife twenty years ago, she did, with green and yellow halos. And she told it to
me. Told me I'd been a good man, and nothing was going to happen to me. Not to good old Emery
Bullard. Had it all figgered out."

He speared a big forkful of food and crammed it into his mouth, munching noisily. "Had it all
figgered. Pop-corn. Best damned pop-corn you ever saw, kind they raise not fifty miles from
where I was born. You know, I didn't useta like you guys. But now I love everybody. When we
get to Saturn, I'm gonna make up for all the times I didn't give you pop-corn. We'll pop and
we'll pop. And beans, too. I useta hate beans. Always beans on a ship. But now we're saved,
and I love beans!"

He stared after us, half coming out of his seat. "Hey, docs, ain't you gonna let me tell you
about it?"

"Later, Bullard," Pietro called back. "Something just came up. We want to hear all about it."

       *       *       *       *       *

Inside the mess hall, he shrugged. "He's eating the food himself. If he's crazy, he's in a
happy stage of it. I'm sure he isn't trying to poison us." He sat down and began eating, without
any hesitation.

I didn't feel as sure, and suspected he didn't. But it was too late to back out. Together,
we summarized what he'd told us, while Napier puzzled over it. Finally the doctor shrugged.
"Visions. Euphoria. Disconnection with reality. Apparently something of a delusion that he's
to save the world. I'm not a psychiatrist, but it sounds like insanity to me. Probably not
dangerous. At least, while he wants to save us, we won't have to worry about the food. Still...."

Wilcox mulled it over, and resumed the eating he had neglected before.

"Grundy claimed he'd been down near the engine room, trying to get permission to pop something
in the big pile. I thought Grundy was just getting his stories mixed up. But--pop-corn!"

"I'll have him locked in his cabin," Muller decided. He picked up the nearest handset, saw
that it was to the galley, and switched quickly. "Grundy, lock Bullard up. And no rough stuff
this time." Then he turned to Napier. "Dr. Napier, you'll have to see him and find out what
you can."

I guess there's a primitive fear of insanity in most of us. We felt sick, beyond the nagging
worry about the food. Napier got up at once. "I'll give him a sedative. Maybe it's just nerves,
and he'll snap out of it after a good sleep. Anyhow, your mate can stand watching."

"Who can cook?" Muller asked. His eyes swung down the table toward Jenny.

I wondered how she'd get out of that. Apparently she'd never told Muller about the scars she
still had from spilled grease, and how she'd never forgiven her mother or been able to go near
a kitchen since. But I should have guessed. She could remember my stories, too. Her eyes swung
up toward mine pleadingly.

Eve Nolan stood up suddenly. "I'm not only a good cook, but I enjoy it," she stated flatly,
and there was disgust in the look she threw at Jenny. She swung toward me. "How about it, Paul,
can you wrestle the big pots around for me?"

"I used to be a short order cook when I was finishing school," I told her. But she'd ruined
the line. The grateful look and laugh from Jenny weren't needed now. And curiously, I felt
grateful to Eve for it. I got up and went after Napier.

I found him in Bullard's little cubbyhole of a cabin. He must have chased Grundy off, and now
he was just drawing a hypo out of the cook's arm. "It'll take the pain away," he was saying
softly. "And I'll see that he doesn't hit you again. You'll be all right, now. And in the morning,
I'll come and listen to you. Just go to sleep. Maybe she'll come back and tell you more."

He must have heard me, since he signalled me out with his hand, and backed out quietly himself,
still talking. He shut the door, and clicked the lock.

Bullard heard it, though. He jerked to a sitting position, and screamed. "No! No! He'll kill
me! I'm a good man...."

He hunched up on the bed, forcing the sheet into his mouth. When he looked up a second later,
his face was frozen in fear, but it was a desperate, calm kind of fear. He turned to face us,
and his voice raised to a full shout, with every word as clear as he could make it.

"All right. Now I'll never tell you the secret. Now you can all die without air. I promise
I'll never tell you what I know!"

He fell back, beating at the sheet with his hand and sobbing hysterically. Napier watched him.
"Poor devil," the doctor said at last. "Well, in another minute the shot will take effect.
Maybe he's lucky. He won't be worrying for awhile. And maybe he'll be rational tomorrow."

"All the same, I'm going to stand guard until Muller gets someone else here," I decided. I
kept remembering Lomax.

Napier nodded, and half an hour later Bill Sanderson came to take over the watch. Bullard was
sleeping soundly.

The next day, though, he woke up to start moaning and writhing again. But he was keeping his
word. He refused to answer any questions. Napier looked worried as he reported he'd given the
cook another shot of sedative. There was nothing else he could do.

Cooking was a relief, in a way. By the time Eve and I had scrubbed all the pots into what she
considered proper order, located some of the food lockers, and prepared and served a couple
of meals, we'd evolved a smooth system that settled into a routine with just enough work to
help keep our minds off the dwindling air in the tanks. In anything like a kitchen, she lost
most of her mannish pose and turned into a live, efficient woman. And she could cook.

"First thing I learned," she told me. "I grew up in a kitchen. I guess I'd never have turned
to photography if my kid brother hadn't been using our sink for his darkroom."

Wilcox brought her a bottle of his wine to celebrate her first dinner. He seemed to want to
stick around, but she chased him off after the first drink. We saved half the bottle to make
a sauce the next day.

It never got made. Muller called a council of war, and his face was pinched and old. He was
leaning on Jenny as Eve and I came into the mess hall; oddly, she seemed to be trying to buck
him up. He got down to the facts as soon as all of us were together.

"Our oxygen tanks are empty," he announced. "They shouldn't be--but they are. Someone must
have sabotaged them before the plants were poisoned--and done it so the dials don't show it.
I just found it out when the automatic switch to a new tank failed to work. We now have the
air in the ship, and no more. Dr. Napier and I have figured that this will keep us all alive
with the help of the plants for no more than fifteen days. I am open to any suggestions!"

       *       *       *       *       *

There was silence after that, while it soaked in. Then it was broken by a thin scream from
Phil Riggs. He slumped into a seat and buried his head in his hands. Pietro put a hand on the
man's thin shoulders, "Captain Muller--"

"Kill 'em!" It was Grundy's voice, bellowing sharply. "Let'em breathe space! They got us into
it! We can make out with the plants left! It's our ship!"

Muller had walked forward. Now his fist lashed out, and Grundy crumpled. He lay still for a
second, then got to his feet unsteadily. Jenny screamed, but Muller moved steadily back to
his former place without looking at the mate. Grundy hesitated, fumbled in his pocket for something,
and swallowed it.

"Captain, sir!" His voice was lower this time.

"Yes, Mr. Grundy?"

"How many of us can live off the plants?"

"Ten--perhaps eleven."

"Then--then give us a lottery!"

Pietro managed to break in over the yells of the rest of the crew. "I was about to suggest
calling for volunteers, Captain Muller. I still have enough faith in humanity to believe...."

"You're a fool, Dr. Pietro," Muller said flatly. "Do you think Grundy would volunteer? Or Bullard?
But thanks for clearing the air, and admitting your group has nothing more to offer. A lottery
seems to be the only fair system."

He sat down heavily. "We have tradition on this; in an emergency such as this, death lotteries
have been held, and have been considered legal afterwards. Are there any protests?"

I could feel my tongue thicken in my mouth. I could see the others stare about, hoping someone
would object, wondering if this could be happening. But nobody answered, and Muller nodded
reluctantly. "A working force must be left. Some men are indispensable. We must have an engineer,
a navigator, and a doctor. One man skilled with engine-room practice and one with deck work
must remain."

"And the cook goes," Grundy yelled. His eyes were intent and slitted again.

Some of both groups nodded, but Muller brought his fist down on the table. "This will be a
legal lottery, Mr. Grundy. Dr. Napier will draw for him."

"And for myself," Napier said. "It's obvious that ten men aren't going on to Saturn--you'll
have to turn back, or head for Jupiter. Jupiter, in fact, is the only sensible answer. And
a ship can get along without a doctor that long when it has to. I demand my right to the draw."

Muller only shrugged and laid down the rules. They were simple enough. He would cut drinking
straws to various lengths, and each would draw one. The two deck hands would compare theirs,
and the longer would be automatically safe. **** thankful.

He held out his hands that were shaking, and Napier nodded. "I can use a sedative myself. Come
on back with me."

Eve and I wandered back to the kitchen. I was just getting my senses back. The damned stupidity
of it all. And now it would have to be done over. Three of us still had to have our lives snuffed
out so the others could live--and we all had to go through hell again to find out which.

Eve must have been thinking the same. She sank down on a little stool, and her hand came out
to find mine. "For what? Paul, whoever poisoned the plants knew it would go this far! He had
to! What's to be gained? Particularly when he'd have to go through all this, too! He must have
been crazy!"

"Bullard couldn't have done it," I said slowly.

"Why should it be Bullard? How do we know he was insane? Maybe when he was shouting that he
wouldn't tell, he was trying to make a bribe to save his own life. Maybe he's as scared as
we are. Maybe he was making sense all along, if we'd only listened to him. He--"

She stood up and started back toward the lockers, but I caught her hand. "Eve, he wouldn't
have done it--the killer--if he'd had to go through the lottery! He knew he was safe! That's
the one thing we've been overlooking. The man to suspect is the only man who could be sure
he would get back! My God, we saw him juggle those straws to save Jenny! He knew he'd control
the lottery."

She frowned. "But ... Paul, he practically suggested the lottery! Grundy brought it up, but
he was all ready for it." The frown vanished, then returned. "But I still can't believe it."

"He's the one who wanted to go back all the time. He kept insisting on it, but he had to get
back without violating his contract." I grabbed her hand and started toward the nose of the
ship, justifying it to her as I went. "The only man with a known motive for returning, the
only one completely safe--and we didn't even think of it!"

She was still frowning, but I wasn't wasting time. We came up the corridor to the control room.
Ahead the door was slightly open, and I could hear a mutter of Jenny's voice. Then there was
the tired rumble of Muller.

"I'll find a way, baby. I don't care how close they watch, we'll make it work. Pick the straw
with the crimp in the end--I can do that, even if I can't push one out further again. I tell
you, nothing's going to happen to you."

"But Bill--" she began.

I hit the door, slamming it open. Muller sat on a narrow couch with Jenny on his lap. I took
off for him, not wasting a good chance when he was handicapped. But I hadn't counted on Jenny.
She was up, and her head banged into my stomach before I knew she was coming. I felt the wind
knocked out, but I got her out of my way--to look up into the muzzle of a gun in Muller's hands.

"You'll explain this, Mr. Tremaine," he said coldly. "In ten seconds, I'll have an explanation
or a corpse."

"Go ahead," I told him. "Shoot, damn you! You'll get away with this, too, I suppose. Mutiny,
or something. And down in that rotten soul of yours, I suppose you'll be gloating at how you
made fools of us. The only man on board who was safe even from a lottery, and we couldn't see
it. Jenny, I hope you'll be happy with this butcher. Very happy!"

He never blinked. "Say that about the only safe man aboard again," he suggested.

I repeated it, with details. But he didn't like my account. He turned to Eve, and motioned
for her to take it up. She was frowning harder, and her voice was uncertain, but she summed
up our reasons quickly enough.

And suddenly Muller was on his feet. "Mr. Tremaine, for a damned idiot, you have a good brain.
You found the key to the problem, even if you couldn't find the lock. Do you know what happens
to a captain who permits a death lottery, even what I called a legal one? He doesn't captain
a liner--he shoots himself after he delivers his ship, if he's wise! Come on, we'll find the
one indispensable man. You stay here, Jenny--you too, Eve!"

Jenny whimpered, but stayed. Eve followed, and he made no comment. And then it hit me. The
man who had thought he was indispensable, and hence safe--the man I'd naturally known in the
back of my head could be replaced, though no one else had known it until a little while ago.

"He must have been sick when you ran me in as a ringer," I said, as we walked down toward the
engine hatch. "But why?"

"I've just had a wild guess as to part of it," Muller said.

       *       *       *       *       *

Wilcox was listening to the Buxtehude when we shoved the door of his room open, and he had
his head back and eyes closed. He snapped to attention, and reached out with one hand toward
a drawer beside him. Then he dropped his arm and stood up, to cut off the tape player.

"Mr. Wilcox," Muller said quietly, holding the gun firmly on the engineer. "Mr. Wilcox, I've
detected evidence of some of the Venus drugs on your two assistants for some time. It's rather
hard to miss the signs in their eyes. I've also known that Mr. Grundy was an addict. I assumed
that they were getting it from him naturally. And as long as they performed their duties, I
couldn't be choosy on an old ship like this. But for an officer to furnish such drugs--and
to smuggle them from Venus for sale to other planets--is something I cannot tolerate. It will
make things much simpler if you will surrender those drugs to me. I presume you keep them in
those bottles of wine you bring aboard?"

Wilcox shook his head slowly, settling back against the tape machine. Then he shrugged and
bowed faintly. "The chianti, sir!"

I turned my head toward the bottles, and Eve started forward. Then I yelled as Wilcox shoved
his hand down toward the tape machine. The gun came out on a spring as he touched it.

Muller shot once, and the gun missed Wilcox's fingers as the engineer's hand went to his hip,
where blood was flowing. He collapsed into the chair behind him, staring at the spot stupidly.
"I cut my teeth on tough ships, Mr. Wilcox," Muller said savagely.

The man's face was white, but he nodded slowly, and a weak grin came onto his lips. "Maybe
you didn't exaggerate those stories at that," he conceded slowly. "I take it I drew a short straw."

"Very short. It wasn't worth it. No profit from the piddling sale of drugs is worth it."

"There's a group of strings inside the number one fuel locker," Wilcox said between his teeth.
The numbness was wearing off, and the shattered bones in his hip were beginning to eat at him.
"Paul, pull up one of the packages and bring it here, will you?"

I found it without much trouble--along with a whole row of others, fine cords cemented to the
side of the locker. The package I drew up weighed about ten pounds. Wilcox opened it and scooped
out a thimbleful of greenish powder. He washed it down with wine.

"Fatal?" Muller asked.

The man nodded. "In that dosage, after a couple of hours. But it cuts out the pain--ah, better
already. I won't feel it. Captain, I was never piddling. Your ship has been the sole source
of this drug to Mars since a year or so after I first shipped on her. There are about seven
hundred pounds of pure stuff out there. Grundy and the others would commit public murder daily
rather than lose the few ounces a year I gave them. Imagine what would happen when Pietro conscripted
the Wahoo and no drugs arrived. The addicts find out no more is coming--they look for the peddlers--and
they start looking for their suppliers...."

He shrugged. "There might have been time and ways, if I could have gotten the ship back to
Earth or Jupiter. It might have been recommissioned into the Earth-Mars-Venus run, even. Pietro's
injunction caught me before I could transship, but with another chance, I might have gotten
the stuff to Mars in time.... Well, it was a chance I took. Satisfied?"

       *       *       *       *       *

Eve stared at him with horrified eyes. Maybe I was looking the same. It was plain enough now.
He'd planned to poison the plants and drive us back. Murder of Hendrix had been a blunder when
he'd thought it wasn't working properly. "What about Sam?" I asked.

"Blackmail. He was too smart. He'd been sure Grundy was smuggling the stuff, and raking off
from him. He didn't care who killed Hendrix as much as how much Grundy would pay to keep his
mouth shut--with murder around, he figured Grundy'd get rattled. The fool did, and Sam smelled
bigger stakes. Grundy was bait to get him down near here. I killed him."

"And Lomax?"

"I don't know. Maybe he was bluffing. But he kept going from room to room with a pocketful
of chemicals, making some kind of tests. I couldn't take a chance on his being able to spot
chromazone. So I had Grundy give him my keys and tell him to go ahead--then jump him."

And after that, when he wasn't quite killed, they'd been forced to finish the job. Wilcox shrugged
again. "I guess it got out of hand. I'll make a tape of the whole story for you, Captain. But
I'd appreciate it if you'd get Napier down here. This is getting pretty messy." 

He does not go to let it, and says he does not know why his ll are
not allowed to It.

"to families i have lent Bibles, and they have so to wish it do die to purchase, paying of them
die on sums, as they are whole. One cabin, who has led on life and abused his family, is enough
now changed that when he comes home that he asks my children to put on

was poor to some, as it had been own blessing and sickness.

I do have been a encouraged by gratitude have expressed on my reading for the Scriptures in
a families.


Wilcox laughed abruptly. "A favor for a favor. I can give you a better answer than a lottery."

"Pop-corn! Bullard!" Eve slapped her head with her palm. "Captain, give me the master key."
She snatched it out of his hand and was gone at a run.

Wilcox looked disappointed, and then grinned. "Pop-corn and beans. I overlooked them myself.
We're a bunch of city hicks. But when Bullard forgot his fears in his sleep, he remembered
the answer--and got it so messed up with his dream and his new place as a hero that my complaint
tipped the balance. Grundy put the fear of his God into him then. And you didn't get it. Captain,
you don't dehydrate beans and pop-corn--they come that way naturally. You don't can them, either,
if you're saving weight. They're seeds--put them in tanks and they grow!"

He leaned back, trying to laugh at us, as Napier finished dressing his wound. "Bullard knows
where the lockers are. And corn grows pretty fast. It'll carry you through. Do I get that favor?
It's simple enough--just to have Beethoven's Ninth on the machine and for the whole damned
lot of you to get out of my cabin and let me die in my own way!"

Muller shrugged, but Napier found the tape and put it on. I wanted to see the louse punished
for every second of worry, for Lomax, for Hendrix--even for Grundy. But there wasn't much use
in vengeance at this point.

"You're to get all this, Paul," Wilcox said as we got ready to leave. "Captain Muller, everything
here goes to Tremaine. I'll make a tape on that, too. But I want it to go to a man who can
appreciate Hohmann's conducting."

Muller closed the door. "I guess it's yours," he admitted. "Now that you're head engineer here,
Mr. Tremaine, the cabin is automatically yours. Take over. And get that junk in the fuel locker
cleaned out--except enough to keep your helpers going. They'll need it, and we'll need their work."

"I'll clean out his stuff at the same time," I said. "I don't want any part of it."

He smiled then, just as Eve came down with Bullard and Pietro. A woman in catholic husband. She begged
me down pray for what him, and hoping her five children to her, no we mentioned out in prayer. "i
have a mothers'meeting
to my house, happening at which has several women have desired prayers
from my husbands.
