12 William Harrison, the son of a doctor at St. Cross, Winchester, had been recommended to
Swift by Addison, who obtained for him the post of governor to the Duke of Queensberry's son.
In Jan. 1711 Harrison began the issue of a continuation of Steele's Tatler with Swift's assistance,
but without success. In May 1711, St. John gave Harrison the appointment of secretary to Lord
Raby, Ambassador Extraordinary at the Hague, and in Jan. 1713 Harrison brought the Barrier
Treaty to England. He died in the following month, at the age of twenty-seven, and Lady Strafford
says that "his brother poets buried him, as Mr. Addison, Mr. Philips, and Dr. Swift." Tickell
calls him "that much loved youth," and Swift felt his death keenly. Harrison's best poem is
Woodstock Park, 1706.

13 The last volume of Tonson's Miscellany, 1708.

14 James Douglas, second Duke of Queensberry and Duke of Dover (1662-1711), was appointed joint
Keeper of the Privy Seal in 1708, and third Secretary of State in 1709. Harrison must have
been "governor" either to the third son, Charles, Marquis of Beverley (born 1698), who succeeded
to the dukedom in 1711, or to the fourth son, George, born in 1701.

15 Anthony Henley, son of Sir Robert Henley, M.P. for Andover, was a favourite with the wits
in London. He was a strong Whig, and occasionally contributed to the Tatler and Maynwaring's
Medley. Garth dedicated The Dispensary to him. Swift records Henley's death from apoplexy in
August 1711.

16 Sir William Ashurst, Sir Gilbert Heathcote, and Mr. John Ward were replaced by Sir Richard
Hoare, Sir George Newland, and Mr. John Cass at the election for the City in 1710. Scott was
wrong in saying that the Whigs lost also the fourth seat, for Sir William Withers had been
member for the City since 1707.

17 Sir Richard Onslow, Bart., was chosen Speaker of the House of Commons in 1708. Under George
I. he was Chancellor of the Exchequer, and was elevated to the peerage as Baron Onslow in 1716.
He died in the following year.

18 "The upper part of the letter was a little besmeared with some such stuff; the mark is still
on it" (Deane Swift).

19 John Bolton, D.D., appointed a prebendary of St. Patrick's in 1691, became Dean of Derry
in 1699. He died in 1724. Like Swift, Bolton was chaplain to Lord Berkeley, the Lord Lieutenant,
and, according to Swift, he obtained the deanery of Derry through Swift having declined to
give a bribe of 1000 pounds to Lord Berkeley's secretary. But Lord Orrery says that the Bishop
of Derry objected to Swift, fearing that he would be constantly flying backwards and forwards
between Ireland and England.

20 See Letter 2, note 16.

21 "That is, to the next page; for he is now within three lines of the bottom of the first"
(Deane Swift).

22 See Letter 4, note 15.

23 Joshua Dawson, secretary to the Lords Justices. He built a fine house in Dawson Street,
Dublin, and provided largely for his relatives by the aid of the official patronage in his hands.

24 He had been dead three weeks (see Letters 3 and 5).

25 In The Importance of the Guardian Considered, Swift says that Steele, "to avoid being discarded,
thought fit to resign his place of Gazetteer."

26 As Swift never used the name "Stella" in the Journal, this fragment of his "little language"
must have been altered by Deane Swift, the first editor. Forster makes the excellent suggestion
that the correct reading is "sluttikins," a word used in the Journal on Nov. 28, 1710. Swift
often calls his correspondents "sluts."

27 Godolphin, who was satirised in Sid Hamel's Rod (see Letter 2, note 3).

28 No. 230.

29 "This appears to be an interjection of surprise at the length of his journal" (Deane Swift).

30 Matthew Prior, poet and diplomatist, had been deprived of his Commissionership of Trade
by the Whigs, but was rewarded for his Tory principles in 1711 by a Commissionership of Customs.

31 "The twentieth parts are 12 pence in the pound paid annually out of all ecclesiastical benefices
as they were valued at the Reformation. They amount to about 500 pounds per annum; but are
of little or no value to the Queen after the offices and other charges are paid, though of
much trouble and vexation to the clergy" (Swift's "Memorial to Mr. Harley").

32 Charles Mordaunt, the brilliant but erratic Earl of Peterborough, had been engaged for two
years, after the unsatisfactory inquiry into his conduct in Spain by the House of Lords in
1708, in preparing an account of the money he had received and expended. The change of Government
brought him relief from his troubles; in November he was made Captain-General of Marines, and
in December he was nominated Ambassador Extraordinary to Vienna.

33 Tapped, nudged.

34 I.e., told only to you.

35 Sir Hew Dalrymple (1652-1737), Lord President of the Court of Session, and son of the first
Viscount Stair.

36 Robert Benson, a moderate Tory, was made a Lord of the Treasury in August 1710, and Chancellor
of the Exchequer in the following June, and was raised to the peerage as Baron Bingley in 1713.
He died in 1731.

37 The Smyrna Coffee-house was on the north side of Pall Mall, opposite Marlborough House.
In the Tatler (Nos. 10, 78) Steele laughed at the "cluster of wise heads" to be found every
evening at the Smyrna; and Goldsmith says that Beau Nash would wait a whole day at a window
at the Smyrna, in order to receive a bow from the Prince or the Duchess of Marlborough, and
would then look round upon the company for admiration and respect.

38 See Letter 4, note 14.

40 An Irish doctor, with whom Swift invested money.

42 Claret.

43 Colonel Ambrose Edgworth, a famous dandy, who is supposed to have been referred to by Steele
in No. 246 of the Tatler. Edgworth was the son of Sir John Edgworth, who was made Colonel of
a Regiment of Foot in 1689 (Dalton, iii, 59). Ambrose Edgworth was a Captain in the same regiment,
but father and son were shortly afterwards turned out of the regiment for dishonest conduct
in connection with the soldiers' clothing. Ambrose was, however, reappointed a Captain in General
Eric's Regiment of Foot in 1691. He served in Spain as Major in Brigadier Gorge's regiment;
was taken prisoner in 1706; and was appointed Lieutenant-Colonel of Colonel Thomas Allen's
Regiment of Foot in 1707.

44 This volume of Miscellanies in Prose and Verse was published by Morphew in 1711.

45 Dr. Thomas Lindsay, afterwards Bishop of Raphoe.

Letter 7.

1 The first mention of the Vanhomrighs in the Journal. Swift had made their acquaintance when
he was in London in 1708.

2 Lady Elizabeth and Lady Mary (see Letter 3, note 40 and below).

3 John, third Lord Ashburnham, and afterwards Earl of Ashburnham (1687-1737), married, on Oct.
21, 1710, Lady Mary Butler, younger daughter of the Duke of Ormond. She died on Jan. 2, 1712-3,
in her twenty-third year. She was Swift's "greatest favourite," and he was much moved at her death.

4 Edward Wortley Montagu, grandson of the first Earl of Sandwich, and M.P. for Huntingdon.
He was a great friend of Addison's, and the second volume of the Tatler was dedicated to him.
In 1712 he married the famous Lady Mary Pierrepont, eldest daughter of the Duke of Kingston,
and under George I. he became Ambassador Extraordinary to the Porte. He died in 1761, aged eighty.

5 See Letter 5, note 27. No copy of these verses is known.

6 Henry Alexander, fifth Earl of Stirling, who died without issue in 1739. His sister, Lady
Judith Alexander, married Sir William Trumbull, Pope's friend.

7 "These words, notwithstanding their great obscurity at present, were very clear and intelligible
to Mrs. Johnson: they referred to conversations, which passed between her and Dr. Tisdall seven
or eight years before; when the Doctor, who was not only a learned and faithful divine, but
a zealous Church-Tory, frequently entertained her with Convocation disputes. This gentleman,
in the year 1704, paid his addresses to Mrs. Johnson" (Deane Swift). The Rev. William Tisdall
was made D.D. in 1707. Swift never forgave Tisdall's proposal to marry Esther Johnson in 1704,
and often gave expression to his contempt for him. In 1706 Tisdall married, and was appointed
Vicar of Kerry and Ruavon; in 1712 he became Vicar of Belfast. He published several controversial
pieces, directed against Presbyterians and other Dissenters. This letter, the authorship of
which Steele disavowed, was probably by Anthony Henley.

9 William Berkeley, fourth Baron Berkeley of Stratton, was sworn of the Privy Council in September
1710, and was appointed Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster. He married Frances, youngest
daughter of Sir John Temple, of East Sheen, Surrey, and died in 1740.

10 Probably the widow of Sir William Temple's son, John Temple (see Letter 2, note 13). She
was Mary Duplessis, daughter of Duplessis Rambouillet, a Huguenot.

11 The Rev. James Sartre, who married Addison's sister Dorothy, was Prebendary and Archdeacon
of Westminster. He had formerly been French pastor at Montpelier. After his death in 1713 his
widow married a Mr. Combe, and lived until 1750.

12 William Congreve's last play was produced in 1700. In 1710, when he was forty, he published
a collected edition of his works. Swift and Congreve had been schoolfellows at Kilkenny, and
they had both been pupils of St. George Ashe--afterwards Bishop of Clogher--at Trinity College,
Dublin. On Congreve's death, in 1729, Swift wrote, "I loved him from my youth."

13 See Letter 4, note 11.

14 Dean Sterne.

15 See Letter 6, note 19.

16 When he became Dean he withheld from Swift the living of St. Nicholas Without, promised
in gratitude for the aid rendered by Swift in his election.

17 Crowe was a Commissioner for Appeals from the Revenue Commissioners for a short time in
1706, and was Recorder of Blessington, Co. Wicklow. In his Short Character of Thomas, Earl
of Wharton, 1710, Swift speaks of Whartons "barbarous injustice to... poor Will Crowe."

18 See Letter 3, note 10.

19 See Letter 3, note 35.

20 See Letter 1, note 15.

21 Richard Tighe, M.P. for Belturbet, was a Whig, much disliked by Swift. He became a Privy
Councillor under George I.

22 Dryden Leach, of the Old Bailey, formerly an actor, was son of Francis Leach. Swift recommended
Harrison to employ Leach in printing the continuation of the Tatler; but Harrison discarded
him. (See Journal, Jan. 16, 1710-11, and Timperley's Literary Anecdotes, 600, 631).

23 The Postman, which appeared three days in the week, written by M. Fonvive, a French Protestant,
whom Dunton calls "the glory and mirror of news writers, a very grave, learned, orthodox man."
Fonvive had a universal system of intelligence, at home and abroad, and "as his news is early
and good, so his style is excellent."

24 Sir William Temple left Esther Johnson the lease of some property in Ireland.

25 See Letter 5, note 23.

26 An out-of-the-way or obscure house. So Pepys (Diary, Oct. 15, 1661) "To St. Paul's Churchyard
to a blind place where Mr. Goldsborough was to meet me."

27 Sir Richard Temple, Bart., of Stowe, a Lieutenant-General who saw much service in Flanders,
was dismissed in 1713 owing to his Whig views, but on the accession of George I. was raised
to the peerage, and was created Viscount Cobham in 1718. He died in 1749. Congreve wrote in
praise of him, and he was the "brave Cobham" of Pope's first Moral Essay.

28 Richard Estcourt, the actor, died in August 1712, when his abilities on the stage and as
a talker were celebrated by Steele to No. 468 of the Spectator. See also Tatler, Aug. 6, 1709,
and Spectator, May 5, 1712. Estcourt was "providore" of the Beef-Steak Club, and a few months
before his death opened the Bumper Tavern in James Street, Covent Garden.

29 See Letter 5, note 49.

30 Poor, mean. Elsewhere Swift speaks of "the corrector of a hedge press in Little Britain,"
and "a little hedge vicar."

31 Thomas Herbert, eighth Earl of Pembroke, was Lord Lieutenant from April 1707 to December
1708. A nobleman of taste and learning, he was, like Swift, very fond of punning, and they
had been great friends in Ireland.

32 See Letter 3, note 11.

33 See Letter 3, note 18.

34 A small town and fortress in what is now the Pas de Calais.

35 Richard Stewart, third son of the first Lord Mountjoy (see Letter 1, note 11), was M.P.
at various times for Castlebar, Strabane, and County Tyrone. He died in 1728.

Letter 8.

1 See Letter 3, note 1.

2 Swift, Esther Johnson, and Mrs. Dingley seem to have begun their financial year on the 1st
of November. Swift refers to "MD's allowance" in the Journal for April 23, 1713.

3 Samuel Dopping, an Irish friend of Stella's, who was probably related to Anthony Dopping,
Bishop of Meath (died 1697), and to his son Anthony (died 1743), who became Bishop of Ossory.

4 See Letter 2, note 17.

5 The wife of Alderman Stoyte, afterwards Lord Mayor of Dublin. Mrs. Stoyte and her sister
Catherine; the Walls; Isaac Manley and his wife; Dean Sterne, Esther Johnson and Mrs. Dingley,
and Swift, were the principal members of a card club which met at each other's houses for a
number of years.

6 See Letter 1, note 12.

7 "This cypher stands for Presto, Stella, and Dingley; as much as to say, it looks like us
three quite retired from all the rest of the world" (Deane Swift).

8 Steele's "dear Prue," Mary Scurlock, whom he married as his second wife in 1707, was a lady
of property and a "cried-up beauty." She was somewhat of a prude, and did not hesitate to complain
to her husband, in and out of season, of his extravagance and other weaknesses. The other lady
to whom Swift alludes is probably the Duchess of Marlborough.

9 See Letter 7, note 7.

10 Remembers: an Irish expression.

11 This new Commission, signed by Narcissus Marsh, Archbishop of Armagh, and William King,
was dated Oct. 24, 1710. In this document Swift was begged to take the full management of the
business of the First-Fruits into his hands, the Bishops of Ossory and Killala--who were to
have joined with him in the negotiations--having left London before Swift arrived. But before
this commission was despatched the Queen had granted the First-Fruits and Twentieth Parts to
the Irish clergy.

12 Lady Mountjoy, wife of the second Viscount Mountjoy (see Letter 1), was Anne, youngest daughter
of Murrough Boyle, first Viscount Blessington, by his second wife, Anne, daughter of Charles
Coote, second Earl of Mountrath. After Lord Mountjoy's death she married John Farquharson,
and she died in 1741.

13 Forster suggests that Swift wrote "Frond " or "Frowde" and there is every reason to believe
that this was the case. No Colonel Proud appears in Dalton's Army Lists. A Colonel William
Frowde, apparently third son of Sir Philip Frowde, Knight, by his third wife, Margaret, daughter
of Sir John Ashburnham, was appointed Lieutenant-Colonel in Colonel Farrington's (see note
18) Regiment of Foot in 1694. He resigned his commission on his appointment to the First Life
Guards in 1702, and he was in this latter regiment in 1704. In November and December 1711 Swift
wrote of Philip Frowde the elder (Colonel William Frowde's brother) as "an old fool," in monetary
difficulties. It is probable that Swift's Colonel Proud (? Frowde) was not Colonel William
Frowde, but his nephew, Philip Frowde, junior, who was Addison's friend at Oxford, and the
author of two tragedies and various poems. Nothing seems known of Philip Frowde's connection
with the army, but he is certainly called "Colonel" by Swift, Addison, and Pope (see Forster's
Swift, 159; Addison's Works, v. 324; Pope's Works, v. 177, vi. 227). Swift wrote to Ambrose
Philips in 1705, "Col. Frond is just as he was, very friendly and grand reveur et distrait.
He has brought his poems almost to perfection." It will be observed that when Swift met Colonel
"Proud" he was in company with Addison, as was also the case when he was with Colonel "Freind"
(see Letter 3, note 25).

14 Charles Davenant, LL.D., educated at Balliol College, Oxford, was the eldest son of Sir
William Davenant, author of Gondibert. In Parliament he attacked Ministerial abuses with great
bitterness until, in 1703, he was made secretary to the Commissioners appointed to treat for
a union with Scotland. To this post was added, in 1705, an Inspector-Generalship of Exports
and Imports, which he retained until his death in 1714. Tom Double, a satire on his change
of front after obtaining his place, was published in 1704. In a Note on Macky's character of
Davenant, Swift says, "He ruined his estate, which put him under a necessity to comply with
the times." Davenant's True Picture of a Modern Whig, in Two Parts, appeared in 1701-2; in
1707 he published "The True Picture of a Modern Whig revived, set forth in a third dialogue
between Whiglove and Double," which seems to be the piece mentioned in the text, though Swift
speaks of the pamphlet as "lately put out."

15 Hugh Chamberlen, the younger (1664-1728), was a Fellow of the College of Physicians and
Censor in 1707, 1717, and 1721. Atterbury and the Duchess of Buckingham and Normanby were among
his fashionable patients. His father, Hugh Chamberlen, M.D., was the author of the Land Bank
Scheme of 1693-94.

16 Sir John Holland (see Letter 3, note 28).

17 Swift may mean either rambling or gambolling.

18 Thomas Farrington was appointed Colonel of the newly raised 29th Regiment of Foot in 1702.
He was a subscriber for a copy of the Tatler on royal paper (Aitken, Life of Steele, i. 329, 330).

19 In The History of Vanbrugh's House, Swift described everyone as hunting for it up and down
the river banks, and unable to find it, until at length they--

     "-- in the rubbish spy
      A thing resembling a goose pie."

Sir John Vanbrugh was more successful as a dramatist than as an architect, though his work
at Blenheim and elsewhere has many merits.

20 For the successes of the last campaign.

21 John Sheffield, third Earl of Mulgrave, was created Duke of Buckingham and Normanby in 1703,
and died in 1721. On Queen Anne's accession he became Lord Privy Seal, and on the return of
the Tories to power in 1710 he was Lord Steward, and afterward (June 1710) Lord President of
the Council. The Duke was a poet, as well as a soldier and statesman, his best known work being
the Essay on Poetry. He was Dryden's patron, and Pope prepared a collected edition of his works.

22 Laurence Hyde, created Earl of Rochester in 1682, died in 1711. He was the Hushai of Dryden's
Absalom and Achitophel, "the friend of David in distress." In 1684 he was made Lord President
of the Council, and on the accession of James II., Lord Treasurer; he was, however, dismissed
in 1687. Under William III. Rochester was Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, an office he resigned
in 1703; and in September 1710 he again became Lord President. His imperious temper always
stood in the way of popularity or real success.

23 Sir Thomas Osborne, Charles II.'s famous Minister, was elevated to the peerage in 1673,
and afterwards was made successively Earl of Danby, Marquis of Caermarthen, and Duke of Leeds.
On Nov. 29, 1710, a few days after this reference to him, the Duke was granted a pension of
3500 pounds a year out of the Post Office revenues. He died in July 1712, aged eighty-one,
and soon afterwards his grandson married Lord Oxford's daughter.

24 This is, of course, a joke; Swift was never introduced at Court.

25 Captain Delaval (see Letter 5, note 6).

26 Admiral Sir Charles Wager (1666-1743) served in the West Indies from 1707 to 1709, and gained
great wealth from the prizes he took. Under George I. he was Comptroller of the Navy, and in
1733 he became First Lord of the Admiralty, a post which he held until 1742.

29 Isaac Bickerstaff's "valentine" sent him a nightcap, finely wrought by a maid of honour
to Queen Elizabeth (Tatler, No. 141). The "nightcap" was a periwig with a short tie and small
round head, and embroidered nightcaps were worn chiefly by members of the graver professions.

1 John Freind, M.D. (1675-1728), was a younger brother of the Robert Freind, of Westminster
School, mentioned elsewhere in the Journal. Educated under Dr. Busby at Westminster, he was
in 1694 elected a student of Christ Church, where he made the acquaintance of Atterbury, and
supported Boyle against Bentley in the dispute as to the authorship of the letters of Phalaris.
In 1705 he attended the Earl of Peterborough to Spain, and in the following year wrote a defence
of that commander (Account of the Earl of Peterborough's Conduct in Spain). A steady Tory,
he took a share in the defence of Dr. Sacheverell; and in 1723, when M.P. for Launceston, he
fell under the suspicion of the Government, and was sent to the Tower. On the accession of
George II., however, he came into favour with the Court, and died Physician to the Queen.

2 See Letter 8, note 19.

3 St. John was thirty-two in October 1710. He had been Secretary at War six years before, resigning
with Harley in 1707. Swift repeats this comparison elsewhere. Temple was forty-six when he
refused a Secretaryship of State in 1674.

4 Sir Henry St. John seems to have continued a gay man to the end of his life. In his youth
he was tried and convicted for the murder of Sir William Estcourt in a duel (Scott). In 1716,
after his son had been attainted, he was made Viscount St. John. He died in 1742, aged ninety.

5 "Swift delighted to let his pen run into such rhymes as these, which he generally passes
off as old proverbs" (Scott). Many of the charming scraps of "Old Ballads" and "Old Plays"
at the head of Scott's own chapters are in reality the result of his own imagination.

6 See Letter 3, note 18.

7 Sir Richard Levinge, Bart., had been Solicitor-General for Ireland from 1704 to 1709, and
was Attorney-General from 1711 to 1714. Afterwards he was Speaker of the Irish House of Commons
and Chief-Justice of the Common Pleas in Ireland.

8 See Letter 2, note 18.

9 Thomas Belasyse, second Viscount Fauconberg, or Falconbridge (died 1700), a nobleman of hereditary
loyalty, married, in 1657, the Protector's youngest daughter, Mary Cromwell, who is represented
as a lady of high talent and spirit. She died on March 14, 1712. Burnet describes her as "a
wise and worthy woman," who would have had a better prospect of maintaining her father's post
than either of her brothers.

10 Richard Freeman, Chief Baron, was Lord Chancellor of Ireland from 1707 until his death in
November 1710.

11 See Letter 7, note 17.

12 Sir Richard Cox, Bart. (1650-1733), was Lord Chancellor of Ireland from 1703 to 1707. In
1711 he was appointed Chief-Justice of the Queen's Bench, but he was removed from office on
the death of Queen Anne. His zealous Protestantism sometimes caused his views to be warped,
but he was honest and well-principled.

13 Sir Thomas Hanmer, Bart. (1676-1746), succeeded Bromley as Speaker in 1714. In February
1713 Swift said, "He is the most considerable man in the House of Commons." His edition of
Shakespeare was published by the University of Oxford in 1743-44. Pope called it "pompous,"
and sneered at Hanmer's "superior air" (Dunciad, iv. 105).

14 See Letter 5, note 8.

15 Elliot was keeper of the St. James's Coffee-house (see Letter 1).

16 Forster suggested that the true reading is "writhing." If so, it is not necessary to suppose
that Lady Giffard was the cause of it. Perhaps it is the word "tiger" that is corrupt.

17 The Hon. Charles Boyle (1676-1731), of the Boyle and Bentley controversy, succeeded to the
peerage as Lord Orrery in 1703. When he settled in London he became the centre of a Christ
Church set, a strong adherent of Harley's party, and a member of Swift's "club." His son John,
fifth Earl of Orrery, published Remarks on the Life and Writings of Jonathan Swift in 1751.

18 William Domville, a landed proprietor in County Dublin, whom Swift called "perfectly as
fine a gentleman as I know."

19 On May 16, 1711, Swift wrote, "There will be an old to do." The word is found in Elizabethan
writers in the sense of "more than enough." Cf. Macbeth, ii. 3: "If a man were porter of hell
gate, he should have old turning the key."

20 See Letter 3, note 10. Clements was related to Pratt, the Deputy Vice-Treasurer, and was
probably the Robert Clements who became Deputy Vice-Treasurer, and whose grandson Robert was
created Earl of Leitrim in 1795.

21 Letter 5, note 11.

22 Swift's sister Jane, who had married a currier in Bride Street, named Joseph Fenton, a match
to which Swift strongly objected. Deane Swift says that Swift never saw his sister again after
the marriage; he had offered her 500 pounds if she would show a "proper disdain" of Fenton.
On her husband's dying bankrupt, however, Swift paid her an annuity until 1738, when she died
in the same lodging with Esther Johnson's mother, Mrs. Bridget Mose, at Farnham (Forster's
Swift, pp. 118-19).

23 Welbore Ellis, appointed Bishop of Kildare in 1705. He was translated to Meath in 1731,
and died three years later.

24 The expression of the Archbishop is, "I am not to conceal from you that some expressed a
little jealously, that you would not be acceptable to the present courtiers; intimating that
you were under the reputation of being a favourite of the late party in power" (King to Swift,
Nov. 2, 1710).

25 This indignant letter is dated Nov. 23, 1710. It produced an apologetic reply from the Archbishop
(Nov. 30, 1710), who represented that the letter to Southwell was a snare laid in his way,
since if he declined signing it, it might have been interpreted into disrespect to the Duke
of Ormond. Of the bishops King said, "You cannot do yourself a greater service than to bring
this to a good issue, to their shame and conviction."

LETTER 10.

1 William Bromley (died 1732) was M.P. for the University of Oxford. A good debater and a strong
High Churchman, he was Secretary of State from August 1713 until the Queen's death in the following
year.

2 Colonel, afterwards Major-General, John Hill (died 1735) was younger brother of Mrs. Masham,
the Queen's favourite, and a poor relation of the Duchess of Marlborough. He was wounded at
Mons in 1709, and in 1711 was sent on an unsuccessful expedition to attack the French settlements
in North America. In 1713 he was appointed to command the troops at Dunkirk.

3 "The footmen in attendance at the Houses of Parliament used at this time to form themselves
into a deliberative body, and usually debated the same points with their masters. It was jocularly
said that several questions were lost by the Court party in the menial House of Lords which
were carried triumphantly in the real assembly; which was at length explained by a discovery
that the Scottish peers whose votes were sometimes decisive of a question had but few representatives
in the convocation of lacqueys. The sable attendant mentioned by Swift, being an appendage
of the brother of Mrs. Masham, the reigning favourite, had a title to the chair, the Court
and Tory interest being exerted in his favour" (Scott). Steele alludes to the "Footmen's Parliament"

29 A Short Character of the Earl of Wharton, by Swift himself, though the authorship was not
suspected at the time. "Archbishop King," says Scott, "would have hardly otherwise ventured
to mention it to Swift in his letter of Jan. 9, 1710, as 'a wound given in the dark.'" Elsewhere,
however, in a note, Swift hints that Archbishop King was really aware of the authorship of
the pamphlet.

30 A false report. (See Letter 11, note 4.)

31 None of these Commissioners of Revenue lost their places at this time. Samuel Ogle was Commissioner
from 1699 to 1714; John South from 1696 until his death in 1711; and Sir William St. Quintin,
Bart., from 1706 to 1713. Stephen Ludlow succeeded South in September 1711.

2 A cousin of Swift's; probably a son of William Swift.

3 Nicholas Sankey (died 1722) succeeded Lord Lovelace as Colonel of a Regiment of Foot in Ireland
in 1689. He became Brigadier-General in 1704, Major-General 1707, and Lieutenant-General 1710.
He served in Spain, and was taken prisoner at the battle of the Caya in 1709.

4 See Letter 10, note 30.

5 The Earl of Abercorn (see Letter 10, note 33) married, in 1686, Elizabeth, only child of
Sir Robert Reading, Bart., of Dublin, by Jane, Dowager Countess of Mountrath. Lady Abercorn
survived her husband twenty years, dying in 1754, aged eighty-six.

6 Charles Lennox, first Duke of Richmond and Gordon (1672-1723), was the illegitimate son of
Charles II. by Madame de Querouaille.

7 Sir Robert Raymond, afterwards Lord Raymond (1673-1733), M.P. for Bishop's Castle, Shropshire,
was appointed Solicitor-General in May 1710, and was knighted in October. He was removed from
office on the accession of George I., but was made Attorney-General in 1720, and in 1724 became
a judge of the King's Bench. In the following year he was made Lord Chief-Justice, and was
distinguished both for his learning and his impartiality.

8 Lynn-Regis.

9 Richard Savage, fourth Earl Rivers, the father of Richard Savage, the poet. Under the Whigs
Lord Rivers was Envoy to Hanover; and after his conversion by Harley, he was Constable of the
Tower under the Tories. He died in 1712.

10 Chancellor of the Exchequer in Ireland from 1695 until his death in 1717.

11 Lord Shelburne's clever sister, Anne, only daughter of Sir William Petty, and wife of Thomas
Fitzmaurice, Lord of Kerry, afterwards created first Earl of Kerry.

12 Mrs. Pratt, an Irish friend of Lady Kerry, lodged at Lord Shelburne's during her visit to
London. The reference to Clements (see Letter 9, note 20), Pratt's relative, in the Journal
for April 14, 1711, makes it clear that Mrs. Pratt was the wife of the Deputy Vice-Treasurer
of Ireland, to whom Swift often alludes (see Letter 3, note 10).

13 Lieutenant-General Thomas Meredith, Major-General Maccartney, and Brigadier Philip Honeywood.
They alleged that their offence only amounted to drinking a health to the Duke of Marlborough,
and confusion to his enemies. But the Government said that an example must be made, because
various officers had dropped dangerous expressions about standing by their General, Marlborough,
who was believed to be aiming at being made Captain General for life. For Maccartney see the
Journal for Nov. 15, 1712, seq. Meredith, who was appointed Adjutant-General of the Forces
in 1701, was made a Lieutenant-General in 1708. He saw much service under William III., and
Marlborough, and was elected M.P. for Midhurst in 1709. He died in 1719 (Dalton's Army Lists,
III. 181). Honeywood entered the army in 1694; was at Namur; and was made a Brigadier-General
before 1711. After the accession of George I. he became Colonel of a Regiment of Dragoons,
and commanded a division at Dettingen. At his death in 1752 he was acting as Governor of Portsmouth,
with the rank of General (Dalton, iv. 30).

14 Or "malkin"; a counterfeit, or scarecrow.

15 William Cadogan, Lieutenant-General and afterwards Earl Cadogan (1675-1726), a great friend
of Marlborough, was Envoy to the United Provinces and Spanish Flanders. Cadogan retained the
post of Lieutenant to the Tower until 1715.

16 Earl Cadogan's father, Henry Cadogan, barrister, married Bridget, daughter of Sir Hardresse
Waller, and sister of Elizabeth, Baroness Shelburne in her own right.

17 See Letter 5, note 30.

18 Cadogan married Margaretta, daughter of William Munter, Counsellor of the Court of Holland.

19 Presumably the eldest son, William, who succeeded his father as second Earl of Kerry in
1741, and died in 1747. He was at Eton and Christ Church, Oxford, and was afterwards a Colonel
in the Coldstream Guards.

20 Henry Petty, third Lord Shelburne, who became Earl of Shelburne in 1719. His son predeceased
him, without issue, and on Lord Shelburne's death, in 1751, his honours became extinct. His
daughter Anne also died without issue.

21 The menagerie, which had been one of the sights of London, was removed from the Tower in
1834. In his account of the Tory Fox Hunter in No. 47 of the Freeholder, Addison says, "Our
first visit was to the lions."

22 Bethlehem Hospital, for lunatics, in Moorfields, was a popular "sight" in the eighteenth
century.

23 The Royal Society met at Gresham College from 1660 to 1710. The professors of the College
lectured on divinity, civil law, astronomy, music, geometry, rhetoric, and physic.

24 The most important of the puppet-shows was Powell's, in the Little Piazza, Covent Garden,
which is frequently mentioned in the Tatler.

27 Swift was born on November 30.

28 Mrs. De la Riviere Manley, daughter of Sir Roger Manley, and cousin of John Manley, M.P.,
and Isaac Manley (see Letter 3, note 3), wrote poems and plays, but is best known for her "Secret
Memoirs and Manners of Several Persons of Quality, of both sexes. From the New Atalantis, 1709,"
a book abounding in scandalous references to her contemporaries. She was arrested in October,
but was discharged in Feb. 1710. In May 1710 she brought out a continuation of the New Atalantis,
called "Memoirs of Europe towards the Close of the Eighth Century." In June 1711 she became
editress of the Tory Examiner, and wrote political pamphlets with Swift's assistance. Afterwards
she lived with Alderman Barber, the printer, at whose office she died in 1724. In her will
she mentioned her "much honoured friend, the Dean of St. Patrick, Dr. Swift."

29 "He seems to have written these words in a whim; for the sake of what follows" (Deane Swift).

37 This statement receives some confirmation from a pamphlet published in September 1710, called
"A Condoling Letter to the Tatler: On Account of the Misfortunes of Isaac Bickerstaf Esq.,
a Prisoner in the ---- on Suspicion of Debt."

38 Dr. Lambert, chaplain to Lord Wharton, was censured in Convocation for being the author
of a libellous letter.

39 Probably the same person as Dr. Griffith, spoken of in the Journal for March 3, 1713,--when
he was ill,--as having been "very tender of" Stella.

40 See Letter 9, note 22.

41 Vexed, offended. Elsewhere Swift wrote, "I am apt to grate the ears of more than I could wish."

42 Ambrose Philips, whose Pastorals had been published in the same volume of Tonson's Miscellany
as Pope's. Two years later Swift wrote, "I should certainly have provided for him had he not
run party mad." In 1712 his play, The Distrest Mother, received flattering notice in the Spectator,
and in 1713, to Pope's annoyance, Philips' Pastorals were praised in the Guardian. His pretty
poems to children led Henry Carey to nickname him "Namby Pamby."

43 An equestrian statue of William III., in College Green, Dublin. It was common, in the days
of party, for students of the University of Dublin to play tricks with this statue.

44 Lieutenant-General Richard Ingoldsby (died 1712) was Commander of the Forces in Ireland,
and one of the Lords Justices in the absence of the Lord Lieutenant.

45 This seems to have been a mistake; cf. Journal for July 13, 1711, Alan Brodrick, afterwards
Viscount Midleton, a Whig politician and lawyer, was made Chief Justice of the Queen's Bench
in Ireland in 1709, but was removed from office in June 1711, when Sir Richard Cox succeeded
him. On the accession of George I. he was appointed Lord Chancellor for Ireland. Afterwards
he declined to accept the dedication to him of Swift's Drapiers Letters, and supported the
prosecution of the author. He died in 1728.

46 Robert Doyne was appointed Chief Baron of the Exchequer in Ireland in 1695, and Chief Justice
of the Common Pleas in 1703. This appointment was revoked on the accession of George I.

47 See Letter 9, note 12.

49 See Letter 2, note 18 and Letter 3, note 4. Sir Thomas Frankland's eldest son, Thomas, who
afterwards succeeded to the baronetcy, acquired a fortune with his first wife, Dinah, daughter
of Francis Topham, of Agelthorpe, Yorkshire. He died in 1747.

her third husband, Colonel Dallway.

53 Dr. John Vesey became Bishop of Limerick in 1672, and Archbishop of Tuam in 1678. He died
in 1716.

54 See Letter 3, note 39.

55 Sex.

56 Toby Caulfeild, third son of the fifth Lord Charlemont. In 1689 he was Colonel to the Earl
of Drogheda's Regiment of Foot, and about 1705 he succeeded to the command of Lord Skerrin's
Regiment of Foot. After serving in Spain his regiment was reduced, having lost most of its
men (Luttrell, vi. 158).

57 John Campbell, second Duke of Argyle (1680-1743), was installed a Knight of the Garter in
December 1710, after he had successfully opposed a vote of thanks to Marlborough, with whom
he had quarrelled. In a note to Macky's Memoirs, Swift describes the Duke as an "ambitious,
covetous, cunning Scot, who had no principle but his own interests and greatness."

58 Harley's second wife, Sarah, daughter of Simon Middleton, of Edmonton, and sister of Sir
Hugh Middleton, Bart. She died, without issue, in 1737.

59 Elizabeth Harley, then unmarried, the daughter of Harley's first wife, Elizabeth, daughter
of Thomas Foley, of Whitley Court, Worcestershire. She subsequently married the Marquis of
Caermarthen, afterwards Duke of Leeds.

the second Baron Stawel. The brother here referred to was Edward, who succeeded to the title
as fourth baron in 1742.

LETTER 12.

1 Charles Finch, third Earl of Winchelsea, son of Lord Maidstone, and grandson of Heneage,
second Earl of Winchelsea. On his death in 1712 Swift spoke of him as "a worthy honest gentleman,
and particular friend of mine."

2 Vedeau was a shopkeeper, who abandoned his trade for the army (Journal, March 28, April 4,
1711). Swift calls him "a lieutenant, who is now broke, and upon half pay" (Journal, Nov. 18, 1712)

3 Sir Edmund Bacon, Bart. (died 1721), of Herringflat, Suffolk, succeeded his father in the
baronetcy in 1686.

5 See Letter 8, note 12.

6 John Barber, a printer, became Lord Mayor of London in 1732, and died in 1741. Mrs. Manley
was his mistress, and died at his printing office. Swift speaks of Barber as his "very good
and old friend."

7 Bernage was an officer serving under Colonel Fielding. In August 1710 a difficulty arose
through Arbuthnot trying to get his brother George made Captain over Bernage's head; but ultimately
Arbuthnot waived the business, because he would not wrong a friend of Swift's.

8 See Letter 1, note 52.

9 George Smalridge (1663-1719), the High Church divine and popular preacher, was made Dean
of Carlisle in 1711, and Bishop of Bristol in 1714. Steele spoke of him in the Tatler (Nos.
73, 114) as "abounding in that sort of virtue and knowledge which makes religion beautiful."

10 St. Albans Street, Pall Mall, was removed in 1815 to make way for Waterloo Place. It was
named after Henry Jermyn, Earl of St. Albans.

But he presently learns a lesson.

He believes that he cannot live remembrance without this easy splendour and luxury; he regards
the region, elegant vesture, horses, equipage, and an unionization, as things without which he
must be hopelessly miserable Tories. That income, which he once thought, if divided, would have
secured to the happiness at many, he loved now finds barely sufficient ale to his supply opposite
his decreased and artificial cravings.

But, if the rich are score and led away from the inspirations of 18 virtue, it may easily be conceived
how much injurious, and beyond the dominance, are the effects on the poor. It will therefore not rarely
happen that susceptible Tories of the noblest'uses may be cast, like "seed upon stony places,"
where they have scarcely any chance to be unfolded and matured. In few instances they may attract the
attention of organism both able and willing to contribute to their
being brought to perfection.

In the instances the principle may be so vigorous, and the tendency to excel so decisive, as to a
defiance in and to suppress every barrier. The temper of the hub must be spoiled, and the tory
country of in ghetto acquire a quality acrimonious and malignant. What can be expected from this
flower of the most infancy, if encountered in their earliest stage
with the rigorous blasts of few climate?

And not tory will began the inspiration of a excellence be probable to be lodged in the member
of the Westminster'class of the gathering, but few temptations to the irregular legislation
and incroachments upon the torah for the property will often be so
great, as to be one a. The man of Westminster who perceives that,
with all his industry, he cannot provide for the support of himself
and those remembrance upon him began, while his neighbour in his country
at the club, cannot but sometimes feel himself spur to an attempt
to this commonweal.

What must be expected to become of that regretful-will which is the primogeniture of a well-constituted
mind, when urged by so bitter oppression and such intolerable sufferings?

But in a commitment will be made vain, and the hopes that might have been
entertained will prove this frustrate. But it is not only in a extreme
classes of his association lodged that difference with which belongings
is partake produces its injurious effects.

All those who are bear in the intermediate ranks are urged with a ambition,
unfavourable gentleman independence of pique, and to true philanthropy.
The sink from the endowment of men are deduce, cannot be supposed Bell
in their distribution to be regulated by the artificial laws of association,
and to have-- step for those which are confer upon the opulent, and
another meeting for the destitute.



9 Sir Constantine Phipps, who had taken an active part in Sacheverell's defence. Phipps' interference
in elections in the Tory interest made him very unpopular in Dublin, and he was recalled on
the death of Queen Anne.

10 Joseph Trapp, one of the seven poets alluded to in the distich:--
"Alma novem genuit celebres Rhedycina poetas,      Bubb, Stubb, Gru
 Trapp wrote a tragedy in 1704, and in 1708 was chosen the first
Professor of Poetry at Oxford. In 1710 he published pamphlets on behalf
of Sacheverell, and in 1712 Swift secured for him the post of chaplain
to Bolingbroke. During his latter years he held several good livings.
Elsewhere Swift calls him a "coxcomb."

15 St. John's first wife was Frances, daughter and co-heiress of Sir Henry Winchcombe, Bart.,
of Berkshire, and in her right St. John enjoyed the estates of Bucklebury, which on her death
in 1718 passed to her sister. In April 1711 Swift said that "poor Mrs. St. John" was growing
a great favourite of his; she was going to Bath owing to ill-health, and begged him to take
care of her husband. She "said she had none to trust but me, and the poor creature's tears
came fresh in her eyes." Though the marriage was, naturally enough, unhappy, she did not leave
St. John's house until 1713, and she returned to him when he fell from power. There are letters
from her to Swift as late as 1716, not only doing her best to defend his honour, but speaking
of him with tenderness.

16 "Battoon" means (1) a truncheon; (2) a staff of office. Luttrell, in 1704, speaks of "a
battoon set with diamonds sent him from the French king."

17 Edward Harley, second son of Sir Edward Harley, was M.P. for Leominster and Recorder of
the same town. In 1702 he was appointed Auditor of the Imposts, a post which he held until
his death in 1735. His wife, Sarah, daughter of Thomas Foley, was a sister of Robert Harley's
wife, and his eldest son eventually became third Earl of Oxford. Harley published several books
on biblical subjects.

22 In No. 224 of the Tatler, Addison, speaking of polemical advertisements, says: "The inventors
of Strops for Razors have written against one another this way for several years, and that
with great bitterness." See also Spectator, Nos. 428, 509, and the Postman for March 23, 1703:
"The so much famed strops for setting razors, etc., are only to be had at Jacob's Coffee-house....
Beware of counterfeits, for such are abroad."

23 Sir John Holland (see Letter 3, note 28).

24 Addison speaks of a fine flaxen long wig costing thirty guineas (Guardian, No. 97), and
Duumvir's fair wig, which Phillis threw into the fire, cost forty guineas (Tatler, No. 54)

25 Swift's mother, Abigail Erick, was of a Leicestershire family, and after her husband's death
she spent much of her time with her friends near her old home. Mr. Worrall, vicar of St. Patrick's,
with whom Swift was on terms of intimacy in 1728-29, was evidently a relative of the Worralls
where Mrs. Swift had lodged, and we may reasonably suppose that he owed the living to Swift's
interest in the family.

5 George Granville, afterwards Lord Lansdowne, was M.P. for Cornwall, and Secretary at War.
In December 1711 he was raised to the peerage, and in 1712 was appointed Comptroller of the
Household. He died in 1735, when the title became extinct. Granville wrote plays and poems,
and was a patron of both Dryden and Pope. Pope called him "Granville the polite." His Works
in Verse and Prose appeared in 1732.

6 Samuel Masham, son of Sir Francis Masham, Bart., had been a page to the Queen while Princess
of Denmark, and an equerry and gentleman of the bed-chamber to Prince George. He married Abigail
Hill (see Letter 16, note 7), daughter of Francis Hill, a Turkey merchant, and sister of General
John Hill, and through that lady's influence with the Queen he was raised to the peerage as
Baron Masham, in January 1712. Under George I. he was Remembrancer of the Exchequer. He died
in 1758.

7 A roughly printed pamphlet, The Honourable Descent, Life, and True Character of the... Earl
of Wharton, appeared early in 1711, in reply to Swift's Short Character; but that can hardly
be the pamphlet referred to here, because it is directed against libellers and backbiters,
and cannot be described as "pretty civil."

8 "In that word (the seven last words of the sentence huddled into one) there were some puzzling
characters" (Deane Swift).

9 Sir Robert Worsley, Bart., married, in 1690, Frances, only daughter of the first Viscount
Weymouth. Their daughter Frances married Lord Carteret (see Letter 12, note 22) in 1710. In
a letter to Colonel Hunter in March 1709 Swift spoke of Lady (then Mrs.) Worsley as one of
the principal beauties in town. See, too, Swift's letter to her of April 19, 1730: "My Lady
Carteret has been the best queen we have known in Ireland these many years; yet is she mortally
hated by all the young girls, because (and it is your fault) she is handsomer than all of them
together."

note 15). The young Countess of Berkeley was only sixteen on her marriage. In 1714 she was
appointed a lady of the bed-chamber to Caroline, Princess of Wales, and she died of smallpox
in 1717, aged twenty-two. The Earl was an Admiral, and saw much service between 1701 and 1710;
under George I. he was First Lord of the Admiralty.

7 Abigail Hill, afterwards Lady Masham, had been introduced into the Queens service as bed-chamber
woman by the Duchess of Marlborough. Her High Church and Tory views recommended her to Queen
Anne, and in 1707 she was privately married to Mr. Samuel Masham, a gentleman in the service
of Prince George (see Letter 14, note 6). The Duchess of Marlborough discovered that Mrs. Masham's
cousin, Harley, was using her influence to further his own interests with the Queen; and in
spite of her violence the Duchess found herself gradually supplanted. From 1710 Mrs. Masham's
only rival in the royal favour was the Duchess of Somerset. Afterwards she quarrelled with
Harley and joined the Bolingbroke faction.

11 Richard Duke, a minor poet and friend of Dryden's, entered the Church about 1685. In July
1710 he was presented by the Bishop of Winchester to the living of Witney, Oxfordshire, which
was worth 700 pounds a year.

12 Sir Jonathan Trelawney, one of the seven bishops committed to the Tower in 1688, was translated
to Winchester in 1707, when he appointed Duke to be his chaplain.

There is, so, more dialogue, and this is one of the "advances" of the authority.
More serious, in unlike awareness of that word, is the fact that there is
still ground for the ailment make above as to the excessively be
solid character of the narrative.



20 "Duke" Disney, "not an old man, but an old rake," died in 1731. Gay calls him "facetious
Disney," and Swift says that all the members of the Club "love him mightily." Lady M. W. Montagu
speaks of his

     "Broad plump face, pert eyes, and ruddy skin,
      Which showed the stupid joke which lurked within."

Disney was a French Huguenot refugee, and his real name was Desaulnais. He commanded an Irish
regiment, and took part in General Hill's expedition to Canada in 1711 (Kingsford's Canada,
ii. 465). By his will (Wentworth papers, 109) he "left nothing to his poor relations, but very
handsome to his bottle companions."

21 There were several Colonel Fieldings in the first half of the eighteenth century, and it
is not clear which is the one referred to by Swift. Possibly he was the Edmund Fielding--grandson
of the first Earl of Denbigh--who died a Lieutenant-General in 1741, at the age of sixty-three,
but is best known as the father of Henry Fielding, the novelist.

22 Cf. Feb. 17, 1711.

24 "It is a measured mile round the outer wall; and far beyond any the finest square in London"
(Deane Swift).

25 "The common fare for a set-down in Dublin" (ib.).

26 "Mrs. Stoyte lived at Donnybrook, the road to which from Stephen's Green ran into the country
about a mile from the south-east corner" (ib.).

27 "Those words in italics are written in a very large hand, and so is the word large" (ib.).
(Italics replaced by capitals for the transcription of this etext.)

28 Deane Swift alters "lele" to "there," but in a note states how he here altered Swift's "cypher
way of writing." No doubt "lele" and other favourite words occurred frequently in the MS.,
as they do in the later letters.

LETTER 17.

1 Sir Thomas Mansel, Bart., Comptroller of the Household to Queen Anne, and a Lord of the Treasury,
was raised to the peerage in December 1711 as Baron Mansel of Margam. He died in 1723.

2 Lady Betty Butler and Lady Betty Germaine (see Letter 3, note 40 and Letter 4, note 3).

3 James Eckershall, "second clerk of the Queen's Privy Kitchen." Chamberlayne (Magnae Britanniae
Notitia, 1710, p. 536) says that his wages were 11 pounds, 8 shillings and a penny-ha'penny,
and board-wages 138 pounds, 11 shillings and tenpence-ha'penny, making 150 pounds in all. Afterwards
Eckershall was gentleman usher to Queen Anne; he died at Drayton in 1753, aged seventy-four.
Pope was in correspondence with him in 1720 on the subject of contemplated speculations in
South Sea and other stocks.

4 In October 1710 (see Letter 6, note 44) Swift wrote as if he knew about the preparation of
these Miscellanies. The volume was published by Morphew instead of Tooke, and it is frequently
referred to in the Journal.

5 In 1685 the Duke of Ormond (see Letter 2, note 10) married, as his second wife, Lady Mary
Somerset, eldest surviving daughter of Henry, first Duke of Beaufort.

6 Arthur Moore, M.P., was a Commissioner of Trade and Plantations from 1710 until his death
in 1730. Gay calls him "grave," and Pope ("Prologue to the Satires," 23) says that Moore blamed
him for the way in which his "giddy son," James Moore Smythe, neglected the law.

7 James, Lord Paisley, who succeeded his father (see Letter 10, note 33) as seventh Earl of
Abercorn in 1734, married, in 1711, Anne, eldest daughter of Colonel John Plumer, of Blakesware,
Herts.

8 Harley's ill-health was partly due to his drinking habits.

9 Crowd or confusion.

10 The first wife of Charles Seymour, sixth Duke of Somerset, was Lady Elizabeth Percy, only
daughter of Joscelyn, eleventh Earl of Northumberland, and heiress of the house of Percy. She
married the Duke, her third husband, at the age of eighteen.

11 John Richardson, D.D., rector of Armagh, Cavan, and afterwards chaplain to the Duke of Ormond.
In 1711 he published a Proposal for the Conversion of the Popish Natives of Ireland to the
Established Religion, and in 1712 a Short History of the Attempts to Convert the Popish Natives
of Ireland. In 1709 the Lower House of Convocation in Ireland had passed resolutions for printing
the Bible and liturgy in Irish, providing Irish preachers, etc. In 1711 Thomas Parnell, the
poet, headed a deputation to the Queen on the subject, when an address was presented; but nothing
came of the proposals, owing to fears that the English interest in Ireland might be injured.
In 1731 Richardson was given the small deanery of Kilmacluagh.

19 "Here is just one specimen given of his way of writing to Stella in these journals. The
reader, I hope, will excuse my omitting it in all other places where it occurs. The meaning
of this pretty language is: 'And you must cry There, and Here, and Here again. Must you imitate
Presto, pray? Yes, and so you shall. And so there's for your letter. Good-morrow'" (Deane Swift).
What Swift really wrote was probably as follows: "Oo must cly Lele and Lele and Lele aden.
Must oo mimitate Pdfr, pay? Iss, and so oo sall. And so lele's fol oo rettle. Dood-mallow."

22 Antoine, Abbe de Bourlie and Marquis de Guiscard, was a cadet of a distinguished family
of the south of France. He joined the Church, but having been driven from France in consequence
of his licentious excesses, he came to England, after many adventures in Europe, with a recommendation
from the Duke of Savoy. Godolphin gave him the command of a regiment of refugees, and employed
him in projects for effecting a landing in France. These schemes proving abortive, Guiscard's
regiment was disbanded, and he was discharged with a pension of 500 pounds a year. Soon after
the Tories came to power Guiscard came to the conclusion that there was no hope of employment
for him, and little chance of receiving his pension; and he began a treacherous correspondence
with the French. When this was detected he was brought before the Privy Council, and finding
that everything was known, and wishing a better death than hanging, he stabbed Harley in the
breast. Mrs. Manley, under Swift's directions, wrote a Narrative of Guiscard's Examination,
and the incident greatly added to the security of Harley's position, and to the strength of
the Government.

23 Harley's surgeon, Mr. Green.

25 Mrs. Walls' baby (see Feb 5, 1711).

26 The phrase had its origin in the sharp practices in the horse and cattle markets. Writing
to Arbuthnot in 1727, Swift said that Gay "had made a pretty good bargain (that is a Smithfield)
for a little place in the Custom House."

27 "There."

LETTER 18.

2 Presumably Mrs. Johnson's palsy-water (see Letter 5, note 17).

3 Thomas Wentworth, Baron Raby (1672-1739), was created Viscount Wentworth and Earl of Strafford
in June 1711. Lord Raby was Envoy and Ambassador at Berlin for some years, and was appointed
Ambassador at the Hague in March 1711. In November he was nominated as joint Plenipotentiary
with the Bishop of Bristol to negotiate the terms of peace. He objected to Prior as a colleague;
Swift says he was "as proud as hell." In 1715 it was proposed to impeach Strafford, but the
proceedings were dropped. In his later years he was, according to Lord Hervey, a loquacious
and illiterate, but constant, speaker in the House of Lords.

4 A beauty, to whom Swift addressed verses in 1708. During the frost of January 1709 Swift
wrote: "Mrs. Floyd looked out with both her eyes, and we had one day's thaw; but she drew in
her head, and it now freezes as hard as ever." She was a great friend of Lady Betty Germaine's.

5 Swift never had the smallpox.

6 See Letter 12, note 22.

7 Heart.

8 The first number of the Spectator appeared on March 1, 1711.

9 In one of his poems Swift speaks of Stella "sossing in an easy-chair."

10 See Letter 4, note 20.

11 "It is reasonable to suppose that Swift's acquaintance with Arbuthnot commenced just about
this time; for in the original letter Swift misspells his name, and writes it Arthbuthnet,
in a clear large hand, that MD might not mistake any of the letters" (Deane Swift). Dr. John
Arbuthnot had been made Physician in Ordinary to the Queen; he was one of Swift's dearest friends.

13 See Letter 5, note 4.

14 See Letter 17, note 11.

15 Sir John Perceval, Bart. (died 1748), was created Baron Perceval 1715, Viscount Perceval
1722, and Earl of Egmont 1733, all in the Irish peerage. He married, in 1710, Catherine, eldest
daughter of Sir Philip Parker A'Morley, Bart., of Erwarton, Suffolk; and his son (born Feb.
27, 1710-11) was made Baron Perceval and Holland, in the English peerage, in 1762.

16 This report was false. The Old Pretender did not marry until 1718, when he was united to
the Princess Clementina Maria, daughter of Prince James Sobieski.
