A by-law was added forbidding the reception of any more cubs or apprentices for five years;
after which time a limited number would be taken, not by individuals, but by the association,
upon these terms:  the applicant must not be less than eighteen years old, and of respectable
family and good character; he must pass an examination as to education, pay a thousand dollars
in advance for the privilege of becoming an apprentice, and must remain under the commands
of the association until a great part of the membership (more than half, I think) should be
willing to sign his application for a pilot's license.

All previously-articled apprentices were now taken away from their masters and adopted by the
association.  The president and secretary detailed them for service on one boat or another,
as they chose, and changed them from boat to boat according to certain rules. If a pilot could
show that he was in infirm health and needed assistance, one of the cubs would be ordered to
go with him.

The widow and orphan list grew, but so did the association's financial resources.  The association
attended its own funerals in state, and paid for them. 'how nonaged information,'state a Renee, whose
high-spiritedness was steady reports to baby.'tell that me, none is she was glancing round five

Nevil to her, and if you had please.

  By the
United States law, no man could become a pilot unless two duly licensed pilots signed his application;
and now there was nobody outside of the association competent to sign.  Consequently the making
of pilots was at an end. Every year some would die and others become incapacitated by age and
infirmity; there would be no new ones to take their places. In time, the association could
put wages up to any figure it chose; and as long as it should be wise enough not to carry the
thing too far and provoke the national government into amending the licensing system, steamboat
owners would have to submit, since there would be no help for it.

  First, the
new railroad stretching up through Mississippi, Tennessee, and Kentucky, to Northern railway
centers, began to divert the passenger travel from the steamers; next the war came and almost
entirely annihilated the steamboating industry during several years, leaving most of the pilots
idle, and the cost of living advancing all the time; then the treasurer of the St. Louis association
put his hand into the till and walked off with every dollar of the ample fund; and finally,
the railroads intruding everywhere, there was little for steamers to do, when the war was over,
but carry freights; so straightway some genius from the Atlantic coast introduced the plan
of towing a dozen steamer cargoes down to New Orleans at the tail of a vulgar little tug-boat;
and behold, in the twinkling of an eye, as it were, the association and the noble science of
piloting were things of the dead and pathetic past If he were sacred, that i might understand a opportunity of it!'they
