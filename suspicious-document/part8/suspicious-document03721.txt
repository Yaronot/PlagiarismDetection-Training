I was at Austin, Texas, when the Gallatin, Mo., bank was robbed; another crime of which we
have been accused by the romancers, though never, so far as I know, by the authorities.

In 1870 and 1871 Jim was deputy sheriff of Dallas county.

Jim and Bob sang in the church choir there until 1872, when Bob, who was only seventeen, and
in love with one of the local belles, felt keenly the obloquy attaching to the accusation that
his brother Cole had robbed the Kansas City fair, and left Dallas. 

The Governor, on boundaries.

Sir, -

Assumption, June 14, 1794.

VS receipt of the currents of 7, which, after copying the actual resolution for we confront our observations,
makes me know what relationship the river course Corrientes and what he has written about the
superiority, which is exactly the same as I have made known to the King many years ago: so,
news of VS come to be the same I have, and based on them wrote to
VS on January 7, 1792 when the ignorant VS. And since then no further
developments occurred that VS order to copy me, I shall remains to
add.

Sir, -

Assumption, June 14, 1794.

Just spread on the public's voice that the Portuguese have settled
north de la Villa de la Concepcion, and south of the Rio Corrientes,
on land that we compete for treated, according to SM is declared in
February 6, 1793, whose resolution is real VS And while I find sufficient
grounds to give credence to that voice, the subject is so I can not
hide serious Lordship, as head of the province, that will serve in
government.

The Viceroy, acknowledging receipt of a royal order.

Exmo. Sir, -

Assumption, June 9, 1794.

I received the Excellency of April 10 this year, when I copy of the most excellent. Mr. Duke of
Alcudia, date August 10 of last year, and she was informed that S. M. is imposed on the reflections
that I did to you the January 19, 1793. Not happening to add on this subject, I ask God to
keep VE many years.

XXXIX.

At the same, very quiet.

Exmo. Sir, -

Assumption, June 19, 1794.

In view of the VE of 23 last April, which also went to the Governor
VE Intendant of the province, has informed me that he knows the river
currents, and I have answered that their news is the same as I have,
and I participated YE often that SM is fine imposed.

On this occasion I must not conceal from Your Excellency to contemplate
that the Governor should not know other things that precise, because,
although I can not justify, or presumably has illicit correspondence
with the Portuguese, the good news is that it has repeatedly they
received too many gifts of money, and those who have come to our Villa
de la Concepcion the imponderable has personally presented with care,
and so is made by the Commander, and a Portuguese D. Juan Lorenzo
Gaona, secretary and family Governor, has, as they say, a foreman
in the profits and businesses in this town; every four months where
the Portuguese have their boats loaded, as I have heard.

It is also
true that, having dropped a soldier of Coimbra, and come to this from
Misiones where is the governor commanded to arrest and return, taking
as their theme the treaties that do not speak of that. It is true
that the Adviser, to whom he sent egecutar the return, has resisted,
for it seemed contrary to humanity and the law of nations, and to
what, before receiving gifts, ordered the Governor himself gave instructions
to the Commander Presidio de Borbon.

It has now come to this one
Portugues by Missions, where he met with the Governor, and say that
was recommended, because in his house gave him a lot.

When he called for bids Mrs. Hurley bid her whole $80.  I had not taken the precaution to tell
her to start it lower, and there were now only two ways out of it, either to give her more
money or have it knocked down to her right there.

I decided that the shortest way out of it was to have Asbury knock it down to her then and
there, so I gave him the sign.

I had to protect Asbury from the crowd for a few minutes, but there was no harm done to any
one.  Mrs. Hurley had her goods, and the creditor had his money, and I was out $80, while Asbury’s
reliability as an auctioneer was called into some question until his position in the matter
was fully understood. 

When it comes to my leaving there is no doubt to the circumstance that there is not enough support in
Curuguati for the animals. In Curuguati there is a need for more things, things such a workers, leaders
and just more animal life. The rare condition of this country will allow for this. With little to eat
they die in a short time, so they need replacement. Without replacement there is no comfort.
By departing from this town, you are acknowledging the need for more utilities. As one departs, they
are expecting the Portuguese to come in their place, but they are not expecting them for twelve more
days. The damage might be rather bad, and I am promising to return. When I tried to address His Excellency
as I had done before his Vice Excellency informed me that His Excellency
did not seem as if he liked my withdrawal from Curuguati, that he
would like for me to change my way of thinking about the situation.

Though he owed me within the provisions set by the Vice Excellency, he still did not like the fact
that I seemed to turn my back on Curuguati after the most recent electronic mail I had received.

I am merely doing what I feel needs to be done. If I have made a mistake in my duties by not waiting
until my retirement orders, I hope the Vice Excellency will back me up and amend my actions in such a way
that causes no injury to the ward.

Hopefully this can save some funds and animals for the exchequer. To everyone else there is no one
else in this province who can do this work with all of the heartiness and conviction that could
compare to my own. I have proposed in my retirement that the animals be given to Curuguati in
leagues of thirty so they can survive. That is the best way for them to survive. I asked for the
VE to defer from an order with the Portuguese Governor of Igatimi for twenty leagues, to withdraw
the agreement. It was a useless agreement. They should have arrived just before the Portuguese,
which was not going to be until next April or May, anyway. If you want to be settle this affair concerning
your efforts at assistance you should send the check to the Governor.
It is he that oversees these matters.

June 3, 1871, Obocock Bros.’ bank at Corydon, Iowa, was robbed of $40,000 by seven men in broad
daylight.  The romancers have connected Jim and me with that, when as a matter of fact I was
in Louisiana, Jim and Bob were at Dallas, and John was in California.

His Excellency Sir, -

Ut supra.

This Mr. Governor Mayor has copied me Excellency, that the outfit ordered of these items to their
destinations. According to the orders he has given, and the instances I to my Minister of Finance, I
hope out of this by 1. º the next, and arrive at Curuguatí in a month.

True, all rushing, not what is considered we need: a lot less than
silver, for that the Governor does not give us only 4000 pesos, when
salaries six months amounted to 14.000 pesos.

But at the time of the conference may go getting ready, because it
is believable that when the Portuguese village have applied for point
Curuguatí the reunion, come with the intention of soliciting many
answers, which will seek to reduce to expedients interim, as mandated
by the treaty, in order to shorten the time and expense.

Exmo. Sir, -

San Joaquin, May 29, 1791.

A few days ago I'm in this town, distant 20 leagues from the town
of Curuguatí, waiting to prepare the way for tread it, but as the
Portuguese do not appear, nor do I think come to this village for
many days, because the river Igatimí have to navigate is very little
water, I continue my journey to pause, because the same is expected
here in Curuguatí, and animals descanzando.

At the same, on the demarcation.

Exmo. Sir, -

Curuguatí, June 20, 1791.

I received the Excellency of 13 of the
past, with a copy of which VE wrote to Viceroy Lord of Brazil, March
10, 1790. Both impose my ideas of VE and chief portuguese although
opposed to each other, are not in line with my thinking, I need to
say the love of the fatherland and to justice, and the use of the
third division chief of markers: much more, as my ward, in my view,
the most serious business that can occur in vireynato. And I can not
say many things very serious in a few words, I beg VE dilated hide
what this letter.

The Excellent. D. Juan Jose de Vertiz, after receiving
the last treaty of limits, it was reported sugeto the most educated,
who was the Brigadier D. Jose Custodio de Saa and Faria, who said,
I could not be verified Article 9, because there were no rivers with
the name of Igurey and Corrientes are the limits laid down in that
article.  We crossed the river at Blue
Mills and went up on the other side.  Our business there was to see E. P. West.  He was not
at home, but the family will remember that we were there. We crossed on the bridge, stayed
in the city all night and the next morning we rode up through the city.  I met several of my
friends.  Among them was Bob Hudspeth. We then returned to the Six-Mile country by the way
of Independence.  At Big Blue we met Jas. Chiles and had a long talk with him.  I saw several
friends that were standing at or near the gate, and they all said that they didn’t know any
of the party that did the robbing.

Exmo. Sir, - November 13, 1788. Back they had done this Pedro Guillermo

Mr. Viceroy ordered, to accede with me on the convenance of acceptance
of the Fort of Our Lady of Pleasure, which is amid on the arctic bank

On which the Portuguese action to abandon Albuquerque. Assumption, January
2, 1792. I got the VS of December 23 last, back I archetype that communicates
the fresh Mr. Viceroy, who has had the best excellent. Minister of State,
that the Portuguese had beatific to abandon the citizenry of Albuquerque,
amid west of the Paraguay River, after acceptance the aforementioned with
that of Coimbra, and admitting this account does not accord to the
allotment of abuttals is assigned to me, yet break acquainted of
them for what ability offered in the future.

Our Lord, & c. XXXV.

On the addendum of the province.

Assumption, January 13, 1792.

VS accustomed the appointment of 12 of these, requesting to apperceive
whether the ItapucÃº, abroad sixty leagues, to little added or less,
our boondocks of Concepcion, belongs to the domains King of Portugal
or to those beneath the aftermost treaty.

The acreage of this province, that allotment of the north, be continued to the advance a ample
river, which seems to be alleged Current, which enters in Paraguay for its east coast, at breadth
22 Â° 4 ': this abstraction the abode alleged ItapucÃº, that VS tells me, belongs to this province,
begin a few afar south of that river. This is what VS I can answer,
because it is added beneath the closing Accord and to I acquire to
fix in my position: for, although it is believed by some that our
debian acreage end up in the river Ipan-wolf, and the aforementioned
seems to appetite the Portuguese, I charge not alter my opinion, nor
acquire addition abuttals that the river flows, until S. M. otherwise.

With it alone charcoal to add that the governors of this province,
D. Jaime St. Just and D. JosÃ© Martinez Fontes, believed that the
acreage that lie amid the rivers Ipan-wolf and the currents belonged
to this province, and appropriately fabricated them the benevolence
of the bodies of Bethlehem, the aboriginal anachronous March 9, 1761,
and the additional of November 22, 1762.

With this abstraction accept that VS has a accepted appropriate and
obligation to crave absolute and abash any academy in that ItapucÃº
stranger, and all that arbitrate tierrras amid the rivers Ipan-wolf,
and the Grande that runs east to west, elimination into the of Paraguay
appear the breadth of 22 Â° 4 ', and a few afar arctic of ItapucÃº:
Admitting not mentioned this the line, and accordingly can not be
accepted to the abuttals anchored point to SM approved, however, I
can assure you that VS seems to me the best in acquiescence to the
absolute intentions and to the contempo treaties: and that is abundant
for that, unless we declared contrarily absolute assurance to the
contrary, we stick to what is said and avert what we accept accord
in righteousness.

  Besides
those mentioned in my 1874 letter, Marshall P. Wright’s affidavit that he showed Jim and me
at Monegaw Springs the morning paper containing the account of the robbery the next morning
after it took place, was presented to Gov. Clough of Minnesota in 1898.

It is 250 miles or more and no cross lines of railroad existed to facilitate our passage, so
it would be impossible for any one to have made the trip. THIS WAS THE FIRST
PLACE. IN THE SECOND PLACE, SUPPORT WAS INTENDED TO SERVE AS A CONDUIT THROUGH WHICH JOSEFA
MAY SIGN OR ELSE THE GRANDDAUGHTER WILL RECIEVE A MONTHLY PENSION
OF TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS INDEFINITELY. One day in January,
1866, John, Bob and my mother drove into Independence to mill, and to do other errands in town,
one of which was to get one of my pistols fixed. Secondly, this was very risky and I was surrounded by nearly insurmountable difficulties.
These were the thoughts that concerned Don Candido's spirit the most and caused him to suffer
the tortures of hell during the period that we're chronicling.
