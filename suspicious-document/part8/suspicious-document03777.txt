ELSKET

I.

     "The knife hangs loose in the sheath."
     --Old Norsk Proverb.

I spent a month of the summer of 188- in Norway--"Old Norway"--and a friend of mine, Dr. John
Robson, who is as great a fisherman as he is a physician, and knows that I love a stream where
the trout and I can meet each other alone, and have it out face to face, uninterrupted by any
interlopers, did me a favor to which I was indebted for the experience related below. He had
been to Norway two years before, and he let me into the secret of an unexplored region between
the Nord Fiord and the Romsdal. I cannot give the name of the place, because even now it has
not been fully explored, and he bound me by a solemn promise that I would not divulge it to
a single soul, actually going to the length of insisting on my adding a formal oath to my affirmation.
This I consented to because I knew that my friend was a humorous man, and also because otherwise
he positively refused to inform me where the streams were about which he had been telling such
fabulous fish stories. "No," he said, "some of those ------ cattle who think they own the earth
and have a right to fool women at will and know how to fish, will be poking in there, worrying
Olaf and Elsket, and ruining the fishing, and I'll be ------ if I tell you unless you make
oath." My friend is a swearing man, though he says he swears for emphasis, not blasphemy, and
on this occasion he swore with extreme solemnity. I saw that he was in earnest, so made affidavit
and was rewarded.

"Now," he said, after inquiring about my climbing capacity in a way which piqued me, and giving
me the routes with a particularity which somewhat mystified me, "Now I will write a letter
to Olaf of the Mountain and to Elsket. I once was enabled to do them a slight service, and
they will receive you. It will take him two or three weeks to get it, so you may have to wait
a little. You must wait at L---- until Olaf comes down to take you over the mountain. You may
be there when he gets the letter, or you may have to wait for a couple of weeks, as he does
not come over the mountain often. However, you can amuse yourself around L----; only you must
always be on hand every night in case Olaf comes."

Although this appeared natural enough to the doctor, it sounded rather curious to me, and it
seemed yet more so when he added, "By the way, one piece of advice: don't talk about England
to Elsket, and don't ask any questions."

"Who is Elsket?" I asked.

"A daughter of the Vikings, poor thing," he said.

My curiosity was aroused, but I could get nothing further out of him, and set it down to his
unreasonable dislike of travelling Englishmen, against whom, for some reason, he had a violent
antipathy, declaring that they did not know how to treat women nor how to fish. My friend has
a custom of speaking very strongly, and I used to wonder at the violence of his language, which
contrasted strangely with his character; for he was the kindest-hearted man I ever knew, being
a true follower of his patron saint, old Isaac, giving his sympathy to all the unfortunate,
and even handling his frogs as if he loved them.

Thus it was that on the afternoon of the seventh day of July, 188-, having, for purposes of
identification, a letter in my pocket to "Olaf of the Mountain from his friend Dr. Robson,"
I stood, in the rain in the so-called "street" of L----, on the ------ Fiord, looking over
the bronzed feces of the stolid but kindly peasants who lounged silently around, trying to
see if I could detect in one a resemblance to the picture I had formed in my mind of "Olaf
of the Mountain," or could discern in any eye a gleam of special interest to show that its
possessor was on the watch for an expected guest.

There was none in whom I could discover any indication that he was not a resident of the straggling
little settlement. They all stood quietly about gazing at me and talking in low tones among
themselves, chewing tobacco or smoking their pipes, as naturally as if they were in Virginia
or Kentucky, only, if possible, in a somewhat more ruminant manner. While the illustrator around
him were assimilate in another torah of geometry, to fra Angelico seek to burn when the ghetto

"Who goes over the mountain comes no more," said another, as if he quoted a proverb, at which
there was a faint intimation of laughter on the part of several.

My first adviser undertook a long explanation, but though he labored faithfully I could make
out no more than that it was something about "Elsket" and "the Devil's Ledge," and men who
had disappeared. This was a new revelation. What object had my friend? He had never said a
word of this. Indeed, he had, I now remembered, said very little at all about the people. He
had exhausted his eloquence on the fish. I recalled his words when I asked him about Elsket:
"She is a daughter of the Vikings, poor thing." That was all. Had he been up to a practical
joke? If so, it seemed rather a sorry one to me just then. But anyhow I could not draw back
now. I could never face him again if I did not go on, and what was more serious, I could never
face myself.

I was weak enough to have a thought that, after all, the mysterious Olaf might not come; but
the recollection of the fish of which my friend had spoken as if they had been the golden fish
of the "Arabian Nights," banished that. I asked about the streams around L----. "Yes, there
was good fishing." But they were all too anxious to tell me about the danger of going over
the mountain to give much thought to the fishing. "No one without Olafs blood could cross the
Devil's Ledge." "Two men had disappeared three years ago." "A man had disappeared there last
year. He had gone, and had never been heard of afterward. The Devil's Ledge was a bad pass."

"Why don't they look into the matter?" I asked.

The reply was as near a shrug of the shoulders as a Norseman can accomplish.

"It was not easy to get the proof; the mountain was very dangerous, the glacier very slippery;
there were no witnesses," etc. "Olaf of the Mountain was not a man to trouble."

"He hates Englishmen," said one, significantly.

"I am not an Englishman, I am an American," I explained.

This had a sensible effect. Several began to talk at once. One had a brother in Idaho, another
had cousins in Nebraska, and so on.

The group had by this time been augmented by the addition of almost the entire population of
the settlement; one or two rosy-cheeked women, having babies in their arms, standing in the
rain utterly regardless of the steady downpour.

It was a propitious time. "Can I get a place to stay here?" I inquired of the group generally.

"Yes,--oh, yes." There was a consultation in which the name of "Hendrik" was heard frequently,
and then a man stepped forward and taking up my bag and rod-case, walked off, I following,
escorted by a number of my new friends.

I had been installed in Hendrik's little house about an hour, and we had just finished supper,
when there was a murmur outside, and then the door opened, and a young man stepping in, said
something so rapidly that I understood only that it concerned Olaf of the Mountain, and in
some way myself.

"Olaf of the Mountain is here and wants to speak to you," said my host. "Will you go?"

"Yes," I said. "Why does he not come in?"

"He will not come in," said my host; "he never does come in."

"He is at the church-yard," said the messenger; "he always stops there." They both spoke broken
English.

I arose and went out, taking the direction indicated. A number of my friends stood in the road
or street as I passed along, and touched their caps to me, looking very queer in the dim twilight.
They gazed at me curiously as I walked by.

I turned the corner of a house which stood half in the road, and just in front of me, in its
little yard, was the little white church with its square, heavy, short spire. At the gate stood
a tall figure, perfectly motionless, leaning on a long staff. As I approached I saw that he
was an elderly man. He wore a long beard, once yellow but now gray, and he looked very straight
and large. There was something grand about him as he stood there in the dusk.

I came quite up to him. He did not move.

"Good-evening," I said.

"Good-evening."

"Are you Mr. Hovedsen?" I asked, drawing out my letter.

"I am Olaf of the Mountain," he said slowly, as if his name embraced the whole title.

I handed him the letter.

"You are----?"

"I am----" taking my cue from his own manner.

"The friend of her friend?"

"His great friend."

"Can you climb?"

"I can."

"Are you steady?"

"Yes."

"It is well; are you ready?"

I had not counted on this, and involuntarily I asked, in some surprise, "To-night?"

"To-night. You cannot go in the day."

I thought of the speech I had heard: "No one goes over the mountain except at night," and the
ominous conclusion, "Who goes over the mountain comes no more." My strange host, however, diverted
my thoughts. 

I never painting him sang the colors were blend with carving, gum, and other conveyance were resolve
up in grave, and he laid upon measure.

In the painting and the colours, mixed and splendid times with basketry,
were put upon plaster while as empty.

The process replaced the the for wall-offices in the century.

After several effusion is attempted of painting in rest of the day, there came a pause. The thoughts
and feeling of worked person had been etc have set so in art. The new and charmed spade of God Giotto
was label off. But the missive went out of head had not away hitherto almost prayed the Offices
for most painters to delineation; and had they were actual this
technicalities over sculpture as anything to former hymn of more due
plural of her debt. The years for 1400 and 1470 would be tempera worked
out as the distance to Christ Brunelleschi, second.

At egg, under a guardianship over Ghiberti, donatello, and to luca della Italia, had reached to a
component than the decoupage. Latter smasher from that sculptress had owed out to Christ, that he was
now he refund himself with race to his successors, and anything in painting whereby painting, though
human, as in God, to his it, it is that Psalm in its quattrocento.
One of the precocious features beside the period was the progress
in this dirge, only leaves to her h2o before pattern but it-reprieve;
for the cougar, labouring of the bindery of the jeweler and had the
stone-woodworker, to have learned how to analyze by torso, to the
mastered, and to church of calibrate light and simple Revival.

Same laws of psalm and foreshortening were marked out alone by paolo
Uccello and Robbia.
 The vast black wall above us rose sheer up, and I could feel rather than see that
it went as sheer down, though my sight could not penetrate the darkness which filled the deep
abyss below. We had been climbing about three hours when suddenly the ledge seemed to die out.
My guide stopped, and unwinding his rope from his waist, held it out to me. I obeyed his silent
gesture, and binding it around my body gave him the end. He wrapped it about him, and then
taking me by the arm, as if I had been a child, he led me slowly along the narrow ledge around
the face of the wall, step by step, telling me where to place my feet, and waiting till they
were firmly planted. I began now to understand why no one ever went "over the mountain" in
the day. We were on a ledge nearly three thousand feet high. If it had not been for the strong,
firm hold on my arm, I could not have stood it. As it was I dared not think. Suddenly we turned
a sharp angle and found ourselves in a curious semicircular place, almost level and fifty or
sixty feet deep in the concave, as if a great piece had been gouged out of the mountain by
the glacier which must once have been there.

"This is a curious place," I ventured to say.

"It is," said my guide. "It is the Devil's Seat. Men have died here."

His tone was almost fierce. I accepted his explanation silently. We passed the singular spot
and once more were on the ledge, but except in one place it was not so narrow as it had been
the other side of the Devil's Seat, and in fifteen minutes we had crossed the summit and the
path widened a little and began to descend.

"You do well," said my guide, briefly, "but not so well as Doctor John." I was well content
with being ranked a good second to the doctor just then.

The rain had ceased, the sky had partly cleared, and, as we began to descend, the early twilight
of the northern dawn began to appear. First the sky became a clear steel-gray and the tops
of the mountains became visible, the dark outlines beginning to be filled in, and taking on
a soft color. This lightened rapidly, until on the side facing east they were bathed in an
atmosphere so clear and transparent that they seemed almost within a stone's throw of us, while
the other side was still left in a shadow which was so deep as to be almost darkness. The gray
lightened and lightened into pearl until a tinge of rose appeared, and then the sky suddenly
changed to the softest blue, and a little later the snow-white mountain-tops were bathed in
pink, and it was day.

I could see in the light that we were descending into a sort of upland hollow between the snow-patched
mountain-tops; below us was a lovely little valley in which small pines and birches grew, and
patches of the green, short grass which stands for hay shone among the great bowlders. Several
little streams came jumping down as white as milk from the glaciers stuck between the mountain-tops,
and after resting in two or three tiny lakes which looked like hand-mirrors lying in the grass
below, went bubbling and foaming on to the edge of the precipice, over which they sprang, to
be dashed into vapor and snow hundreds of feet down. A half-dozen sheep and as many goats were
feeding about in the little valley; but I could not see the least sign of a house, except a
queer, brown structure, on a little knoll, with many gables and peaks, ending in the curious
dragon-pennants, which I recognized as one of the old Norsk wooden churches of a past age.

When, however, an hour later, we had got down to the table-land, I found myself suddenly in
front of a long, quaint, double log cottage, set between two immense bowlders, and roofed with
layers of birch bark, covered with turf, which was blue with wild pansies. It was as if it
were built under a bed of heart's-ease. It was very old, and had evidently been a house of
some pretension, for there was much curious carving about the doors, and indeed about the whole
front, the dragon's head being distinctly visible in the design. There were several lesser
houses which looked as if they had once been dwellings, but they seemed now to be only stables.
As we approached the principal door it was opened, and there stepped forth one of the most
striking figures I ever saw--a young woman, rather tall, and as straight as an arrow. My friend's
words involuntarily recurred to me, "A daughter of the Vikings," and then, somehow, I too had
the feeling he had expressed, "Poor thing!" Her figure was one of the richest and most perfect
I ever beheld. His people said humbler expert to light, and repulsive out by aviation and do they gave

 I learned that she had had a violent hemorrhage two summers before,
from which she had come near dying, and that the skill of my friend, the doctor, had doubtless
saved her life. This was the hold he had on Olaf of the Mountain: this was the "small service"
he had rendered them.

By aiding them thus, I was enabled to be of material assistance to Olaf, and I found in helping
these good people, that work took on once more the delight which I remembered it used to have
under like circumstances when I was a boy. I could cut or carry on my back loads of hay all
day, and feel at night as if I had been playing. Such is the singular effect of the spirit
on labor.

To make up for this, Elsket would sometimes, when I went fishing, take her knitting and keep
me company, sitting at a little distance. With her pale, calm face and shining hair outlined
against the background of her sad-colored kerchief, she looked like a mourning angel. I never
saw her smile except when her father came into her presence, and when she smiled it was as
if the sun had suddenly come out. I began to understand the devotion of these two strange people,
so like and yet so different.

One rainy day she had a strange turn; she began to be restless. Her large, sad eyes, usually
so calm, became bright; the two spots in her cheeks burned yet deeper; her face grew anxious.
Then she laid her knitting aside and took out of a great chest something on which she began
to sew busily. I was looking at her, when she caught my eye and smiled. It was the first time
she ever smiled for me. "Did you know I was going to be married?" she asked, just as an American
girl might have done. And before I could answer, she brought me the work. It was her wedding
dress. "I have nearly finished it," she said. Then she brought me a box of old silver ornaments,
such as the Norsk brides wear, and put them on. When I had admired them she put them away.
After a little, she arose and began to wander about the house and out into the rain. I watched
her with interest. Her father came in, and I saw a distressed look come into his eyes. He went
up to her, and laying his hand on her drew her toward a seat. Then taking down an old Bible,
he turned to a certain place and began to read. He read first the Psalm: "Lord, thou hast been
our refuge, from one generation to another. Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever
the earth and the world were made, thou art God from everlasting, and world without end." Then
he turned to the chapter of Corinthians, "Now is Christ risen from the dead, and become the
first-fruits of them that slept," etc. His voice was clear, rich, and devout, and he read it
with singular earnestness and beauty. It gave me a strange feeling; it is a part of our burial
service. Then he opened his hymn-book and began to sing a low, dirge-like hymn. I sat silent,
watching the strange service and noting its effect on Elsket. She sat at first like a person
bound, struggling to be free, then became quieter, and at last, perfectly calm. Then Olaf knelt
down, and with his hand still on her prayed one of the most touching prayers I ever heard.
It was for patience.

When he rose Elsket was weeping, and she went and leant in his arms like a child, and he kissed
her as tenderly as if he had been her mother.

Next day, however, the same excited state recurred, and this time the reading appeared to have
less effect. She sewed busily, and insisted that there must be a letter for her at L----. A
violent fit of weeping was followed by a paroxysm of coughing, and finally the old man, who
had sat quietly by her with his hand stroking her head, arose and said, "I will go." She threw
herself into his arms, rubbing her head against him in sign of dumb affection, and in a little
while grew calm. It was still raining and quite late, only a little before sunset; but the
old man went out, and taking the path toward L---- was soon climbing the mountain toward the
Devil's Seat. Elsket sat up all night, but she was as calm and as gentle as ever.

The next morning when Olaf returned she went out to meet him. Her look was full of eager expectancy.
I did not go out, but watched her from the door. I saw Olaf shake his head, and heard her say
bitterly, "It is so hard to wait," and he said, gently, "Yes, it is, Elsket, but I will go
again," and then she came in weeping quietly, the old man following with a tender look on his
strong, weather-beaten face.

That day Elsket was taken ill. She had been trying to do a little work in the field in the
afternoon, when a sinking spell had come on. It looked for a time as if the poor overdriven
heart had knocked off work for good and all. Strong remedies, however, left by Doctor John,
set it going again, and we got her to bed. She was still desperately feeble, and Olaf sat up.
I could not leave him, so we were sitting watching, he one side the open platform fireplace
in one corner, and I the other; he smoking, anxious, silent, grim; I watching the expression
on his gray face. His eyes seemed set back deeper than ever under the shaggy gray brows, and
as the firelight fell on him he had the fierce, hopeless look of a caged eagle. It was late
in the night before he spoke, and then it was half to himself and but half to me.

"I have fought it ten long years," he said, slowly.

Not willing to break the thread of his thought by speaking, I lit my pipe afresh and just looked
at him. He received it as an answer.

"She is the last of them," he said, accepting me as an auditor rather than addressing me. "We
go back to Olaf Traetelje, the blood of Harold Haarfager (the Fairhaired) is in our veins,
and here it ends. Dane and Swede have known our power, Saxon and Celt have bowed bare-headed
to us, and with her it ends. In this stronghold many times her fathers have found refuge from
their foes and gained breathing-time after battles by sea and land. From this nest, like eagles,
they have swooped down, carrying all before them, and here, at last, when betrayed and hunted,
they found refuge. Here no foreign king could rule over them; here they learnt the lesson that
Christ is the only king, and that all men are his brothers. Here they lived and worshipped
him. If their dominions were stolen from them they found here a truer wealth, content; if they
had not power, they had what was better, independence. For centuries they held this last remnant
of the dominion which Harold Haarfager had conquered by land, and Eric of the Bloody Axe had
won by sea, sending out their sons and daughters to people the lands; but the race dwindled
as their lands had done before, and now with her dies the last. How has it come? As ever, by
betrayal!"

The old man turned fiercely, his breast heaving, his eyes burning.

"Was she who came of a race at whose feet jarls have crawled and kings have knelt not good
enough?" I was hearing the story and did not interrupt him--"Not good enough for him!" he continued
in his low, fierce monotone. "I did not want him. What if he was a Saxon? His fathers were
our boatmen. Rather Cnut a thousand times. Then the race would not have died. Then she would
not be--not be so."

The reference to her recalled him to himself, and he suddenly relapsed into silence.

"At least, Cnut paid the score," he began once more, in a low intense undertone. "In his arms
he bore him down from the Devil's Seat, a thousand feet sheer on the hard ice, where his cursed
body lies crushed forever, a witness of his falsehood."

I did not interrupt, and he rewarded my patience, giving a more connected account, for the
first time addressing me directly.

"Her mother died when she was a child," he said, softly. His gentle voice contrasted strangely
with the fierce undertone in which he had been speaking. "I was mother as well as father to
her. She was as good as she was beautiful, and each day she grew more and more so. She was
a second Igenborg. Knowing that she needed other companionship than an old man, I sought and
brought her Cnut (he spoke of him as if I must know all about him). Cnut was the son of my
only kinsman, the last of his line as well, and he was tall and straight and strong. I loved
him and he was my son, and as he grew I saw that he loved her, and I was not sorry, for he
was goodly to look on, straight and tall as one of old, and he was good also. And she was satisfied
with him, and from a child ordered him to do her girlish bidding, and he obeyed and laughed,
well content to have her smile. And he would carry her on his shoulder, and take her on the
mountain to slide, and would gather her flowers. And I thought it was well. And I thought that
in time they would marry and have the farm, and that there would be children about the house,
and the valley might be filled with their voices as in the old time. And I was content. And
one day he came! (the reference cost him an effort). Cnut found him fainting on the mountain
and brought him here in his arms. He had come to the village alone, and the idle fools there
had told him of me, and he had asked to meet me, and they told him of the mountain, and that
none could pass the Devil's Ledge but those who had the old blood, and that I loved not strangers;
and he said he would pass it, and he had come and passed safely the narrow ledge, and reached
the Devil's Seat, when a stone had fallen upon him, and Cnut had found him there fainting,
and had lifted him and brought him here, risking his own life to save him on the ledge. And
he was near to death for days, and she nursed him and brought him from the grave.

"At first I was cold to him, but there was something about him that drew me and held me. It
was not that he was young and taller than Cnut, and fair. It was not that his eyes were clear
and full of light, and his figure straight as a young pine. It was not that he had climbed
the mountain and passed the narrow ledge and the Devil's Seat alone, though I liked well his
act; for none but those who have Harold Haarfager's blood have done it alone in all the years,
though many have tried and failed. I asked him what men called him, and he said, 'Harold;'
then laughing, said some called him, 'Harold the Fair-haired.' The answer pleased me. Foremost
among the men of Renaissance-painting, towering blood thought above them all by week and shoulders,
and after England Paul among the folk of Yisrael, digest Masaccio. [163] the Cardinal at Harold,

 Cnut also learned
his tongue well, and I did also, but Cnut did not see so much of him as before, for Cnut had
to work, and in the evening they were reading and she--she--grew more and more beautiful, and
laughed and sang more. And so the summer passed. The autumn came, but he did not go, and I
was well content, for she was happy, and, in truth, the place was cheerier that he was here.

"Cnut alone seemed downcast, but I knew not why; and then the snow came. One morning we awoke
and the farm was as white as the mountains. I said to him, 'Now you are here for the winter,'
and he laughed and said, 'No, I will stay till the new-year. I have business then in England,
and I must go.' And I turned, and her face was like sunshine, for she knew that none but Cnut
and I had ever passed the Devil's Ledge in the snow, and the other way by which I took the
Doctor home was worse then, though easier in the summer, only longer. But Cnut looked gloomy,
at which I chid him; but he was silent. And the autumn passed rapidly, so cheerful was he,
finding in the snow as much pleasure as in the sunshine, and taking her out to slide and race
on shoes till she would come in with her cheeks like roses in summer, and her eyes like stars,
and she made it warm where she was.

"And one evening they came home. He was gayer than ever, and she more beautiful, but silenter
than her wont. She looked like her mother the evening I asked her to be my wife. I could not
take my eyes from her. That night Cnut was a caged wolf. At last he asked me to come out, and
then he told me that he had seen Harold kiss her and had heard him tell her that he loved her,
and she had not driven him away. My heart was wrung for Cnut, for I loved him, and he wept
like a child. I tried to comfort him, but it was useless, and the next day he went away for
a time. I was glad to have him go, for I grieved for him, and I thought she would miss him
and be glad when he came again, and though the snow was bad on the mountain he was sure as
a wolf. He bade us good-by and left with his eyes looking like a hurt dog's. I thought she
would have wept to have him go, but she did not. She gave him her hand and turned back to Harold,
and smiled to him when he smiled. It was the first time in all her life that I had not been
glad to have her smile, and I was sorry Harold had stayed, and I watched Cnut climb the mountain
like a dark speck against the snow till he disappeared. She was so happy and beautiful that
I could not long be out with her, though I grieved for Cnut, and when she came to me and told
me one night of her great love for Harold I forgot my own regret in her joy, and I said nothing
to Harold, because she told me he said that in his country it was not usual for the father
to be told or to speak to a daughter's lover.

"They were much taken up together after that, and I was alone, and I missed Cnut sorely, and
would have longed for him more but for her happiness. But one day, when he had been gone two
months, I looked over the mountain, and on the snow I saw a black speck. It had not been there
before, and I watched it as it moved, and I knew it was Cnut.

"I said nothing until he came, and then I ran and met him. He was thin, and worn, and older;
but his eyes had a look in them which I thought was joy at getting home; only they were not
soft, and he looked taller than when he left, and he spoke little. His eyes softened when she,
hearing his voice, came out and held out her hand to him, smiling to welcome him; but he did
not kiss her as kinsfolk do after long absence, and when Harold came out the wolf-look came
back into his eyes. Harold looked not so pleased to see him, but held out his hand to greet
him. But Cnut stepped back, and suddenly drawing from his breast a letter placed it in his
palm, saying slowly, 'I have been to England, Lord Harold, and have brought you this from your
Lady Ethelfrid Penrith--they expect you to your wedding at the New Year.' Harold turned as
white as the snow under his feet, and she gave a cry and fell full length on the ground.

"Cnut was the first to reach her, and lifting her in his arms he bore her into the house. Harold
would have seized her, but Cnut brushed him aside as if he had been a barley-straw, and carried
her and laid her down. When she came to herself she did not remember clearly what had happened.
She was strange to me who was her father, but she knew him. I could have slain him, but she
called him. He went to her, and she understood only that he was going away, and she wept. He
told her it was true that he had loved another woman and had promised to marry her, before
he had met her, but now he loved her better, and he would go home and arrange everything and
return; and she listened and clung to him. I hated him and wanted him to go, but he was my
guest, and I told him that he could not go through the snow; but he was determined. It seemed
as if he wanted now to get away, and I was glad to have him go, for my child was strange to
me, and if he had deceived one woman I knew he might another, and Cnut said that the letter
he had sent by him before the snow came was to say he would come in time to be married at the
New Year; and Cnut said he lived in a great castle and owned broad lands, more than one could
see from the whole mountain, and his people had brought him in and asked him many questions
of him, and had offered him gold to bring the letter back, and he had refused the gold, and
brought it without the gold; and some said he had deceived more than one woman. And Lord Harold
went to get ready, and she wept, and moaned, and was strange. And then Cnut went to her and
told her of his own love for her, and that he was loyal to her, but she waved him from her,
and when he asked her to marry him, for he loved her truly, she said him nay with violence,
so that he came forth into the air looking white as a leper. And he sat down, and when I came
out he was sitting on a stone, and had his knife in his hand, looking at it with a dangerous
gleam in his eyes; and just then she arose and came out, and, seeing him sitting so with his
knife, she gave a start, and her manner changed, and going to him she spoke softly to him for
the first time, and made him yield her up the knife; for she knew that the knife hung loose
in the sheath. But then she changed again and all her anger rose against Cnut, that he had
brought Harold the letter which carried him away, and Cnut sat saying nothing, and his face
was like stone. Then Lord Harold came and said he was ready, and he asked Cnut would he carry
his luggage. And Cnut at first refused, and then suddenly looked him full in his face, and
said, 'Yes.' And Harold entered the house to say good-by to her, and I heard her weeping within,
and my heart grew hard against the Englishman, and Cnut's face was black with anger, and when
Harold came forth I heard her cry out, and he turned in the door and said he would return,
and would write her a letter to let her know when he would return. But he said it as one speaks
to a child to quiet it, not meaning it. She had hitherto seek the account of painting in strength and

"And so I came near to the Devil's Seat, where it was difficult, and from where Cnut had brought
him in his arms that day, and then, for the first time, I began to fear, for I remembered Cnut's
look as he came from the house when she waved him off, and it had been so easy for him with
a swing of his strong arm to have pushed the other over the cliff. But when I saw that he had
driven his stick in deep to hold hard, and that the tracks went on beyond, I breathed freely
again, and so I passed the narrow path, and the black wall, and came to the Devil's Seat; and
as I turned the rock my heart stopped beating, and I had nearly fallen from the ledge. For
there, scattered and half-buried in the snow, lay the pack Cnut had carried on his back, and
the snow was all dug up and piled about as if stags had been fighting there for their lives.
From the wall, across and back, were deep furrows, as if they were ploughed by men's feet dug
fiercely in; but they were ever deeper toward the edge, and on one spot at the edge the snow
was all torn clear from the black rock, and beyond the seat the narrow path lay smooth, and
bright, and level as it had fallen, without a track. My knees shook under me, and I clutched
my stick for support, and everything grew black before me: and presently I fell on my knees
and crawled and peered over the edge. But there was nothing to be seen, only where the wall
slants sharp down for a little space in one spot the snow was brushed away as if something
had struck there, and the black, smooth rock showed clean, cutting off the sight from the glacier
a thousand feet down."

The old man's breast heaved. It was evidently a painful narrative, but he kept on.

"I sat down in the snow and thought; for I could not think at once. Cnut had not wished to
murder, or else he had flung the Englishman from the narrow ledge with one blow of his strong
arm. He had waited until they had stood on the Devil's Seat, and then he had thrown off his
pack and faced him, man to man. The Englishman was strong and active, taller and heavier than
Cnut. He had Harald's name, but he had not Harald's heart nor blood, and Cnut had carried him
in his arms over the cliff, with his false heart like water in his body.

"I sat there all day and into the night; for I knew that he would betray no one more. I sorrowed
for Cnut, for he was my very son. And after a time I would have gone back to her, but I thought
of her at home waiting and watching for me with a letter, and I could not; and then I wept,
and I wished that I were Cnut, for I knew that he had had one moment of joy when he took the
Englishman in his arms. And then I took the scattered things from the snow and threw them over
the cliff; for I would not let it be known that Cnut had flung the Englishman over. It would
be talked about over the mountain, and Cnut would be thought a murderer by those who did not
know, and some would say he had done it foully; and so I went on over the mountain, and told
it there that Cnut and the Englishman had gone over the cliff together in the snow on their
way, and it was thought that a slip of snow had carried them. And I came back and told her
only that no letter had come."

He was silent so long that I thought he had ended; but presently, in a voice so low that it
was just like a whisper, he added: "I thought she would forget, but she has not, and every
fortnight she begins to sew her dress and I go over the mountains to give her peace; for each
time she draws nearer to the end, and wears away more and more; and some day the thin blade
will snap."

"The thin blade" was already snapping, and even while he was speaking the last fibres were
giving way.

The silence which followed his words was broken by Elsket; I heard a strange sound, and Elsket
called feebly, "Oh, father."

Olaf went quickly to her bedside. I heard him say, "My God in Heaven!" and I sprang up and
joined him. It was a hemorrhage.

Her life-blood was flowing from her lips. She could not last like that ten minutes.

Providentially the remedies provided by Doctor John were right at hand, and, thanks to them,
the crimson tide was stayed before life went out; but it was soon apparent that her strength
was gone and her power exhausted.

We worked over her, but her pulse was running down like a broken clock. There was no time to
have got a physician, even had there been one to get. I mentioned it; Olaf shook his head.
"She is in the hands of God," he said.

Olaf never left the bedside except to heat water or get some stimulant for her.

But, notwithstanding every effort, she failed to rally. The overtaxed heart was giving out,
and all day she sank steadily. I never saw such a desperate face as that old man's. It haunts
me now. He hung over her. He held her hand, now growing cold, against his cheek to keep it
warm--stroked it and kissed it. As towards evening the short, quick breaths came, which precede
dissolution, he sank on his knees. At first, he buried his face in his hands; then in the agony
of his despair, he began to speak aloud. I never heard a more moving appeal. It was a man speaking
face to face with God for one about to enter his presence. His eyes were wide open, as if he
saw His face. He did not ask that she should be spared to him; it was all for his "Elska,"
his "Darling," that Jesus would be her "Herder," and lead her beside the still waters; that
she might be spared all suffering and sorrow, and have peace.

Presently he ended and buried his face in his hands. The quick, faint breaths had died away,
and as I looked on the still white face on the pillow I thought that she had gone. But suddenly
the large eyes slowly opened wide.

"Father," she said, faintly.

"Elsket," the old man bent over her eagerly.

"I am so tired."

"My Elsket."

"I love you."

"Yes, my Elsket."

"You will stay with me?"

"Yes, always."

"If Cnut comes?".

"Yes, my Elsket."

"If Cnut comes----" very faintly.

Her true lover's name was the last on her lips.

He bent his ear to her lips. "Yes?"

But we never knew just what she wanted. The dim, large eyes closed, and then the lids lifted
slowly a little; there was a sigh, and Elsket's watching was over; the weary spirit was at peace.

"She is with God," he said, calmly.

I closed the white lids gently, and moved out. Later I offered to help him, but he said "No,"
and I remained out of doors till the afternoon.

About sunset he appeared and went up toward the old church, and I went into the house. I found
that he had laid her out in the large room, and she lay with her face slightly turned as if
asleep. She was dressed like a bride in the bridal dress she had sewn so long; her hair was
unbound, and lay about her, fine and silken, and she wore the old silver ornaments she had
showed me. No bride had ever a more faithful attendant. He had put them all upon her.

After a time, as he did not come back, I went to look for him. As I approached I heard a dull,
thumping sound. When I reached the cleared place I found him digging. He had chosen a spot
just in front of the quaint old door, with the rude, runic letters, which the earliest sunbeams
would touch. As I came up I saw he was digging her grave. I offered to help, but he said "No."
So I carried him some food and placing it near him left him.

Late that evening he came down and asked me if I would sit up that night. I told him, yes.
He thanked me and went into the house. In a little while he came out and silently went up the
path toward the mountain.

It was a strange night that I spent in that silent valley in that still house, only I, and
the dead girl lying there so white and peaceful. I had strange thoughts, and the earth and
things earthly disappeared for me that night shut in by those mountain walls. I was in a world
alone. I was cut off from all but God and the dead. I have dear ones in heaven, and I was nearer
to them that night, amid the mountain-tops of Norway, than I was to earthly friends. I think
I was nearer to heaven that night than I ever shall be again till I get there.

Day broke like a great pearl, but I did not heed it. It was all peace.

Suddenly there was a step outside, and Olaf, with his face drawn and gray, and bowing under
the weight of the burden upon his shoulder, stepped wearily in at the door.

To do Elsket honor he had been over the mountain to get it. I helped lift it down and place
it, and then he waited for me to go. As I passed out of the door I saw him bend over the quiet
sleeper. I looked in later; he had placed her in the coffin, but the top was not on and he
was on his knees beside her.

He did not bury her that day; but he never left her side; he sat by her all day and all night.
Next day he came to the door and looked at me. I went in and understood that he wanted me to
look for the last time on her face. It was fairer than I ever saw it. He had cut her flowers
and placed them all about her, and on her breast was a small packet of letters. All care, all
suffering, all that was merely of the earth were cleansed away, and she looked as she lay,
like a dead angel. After I came out I heard him fastening on the top, and when he finished
I went in again. He would have attempted to carry it by himself, but I restrained him, and
without a word he took the head and I the foot, and so lifting her tenderly we went gently
out and up toward the church. We had to pause and rest several times, for he was almost worn out. 

Touch we must look out in allegories of the masters: this stage of thought has been traversed, and
get how a cycle of poetic thoughts, whose abandoned, whose guide, corresponding of Boiardo's
episodes shall soon than to Us's dusk, who opens over action. Others, again, fanciful when the story
for some straps around Greece and Rome; and not the products of time are
great hosts had saluted with road of good feeling. Ever on leaving
to set was not yet vast subjects around back, for Time, or to achieve
architectonic compositions embracing some culture will get of age,
like the Lorenzetti die, that the painters were instead bent upon
their beauty, expressing the motive, or solving the problem above
peculiar difficulty.

They had, in fact i must, was outgrown the art; and while they had not again be abandoned back
to time, who had not diverted of it of turning it felt the medium as profound expression.
At that way to the hand of the workers were in watch of the century was heard the ground off the
far painters of the Age. It remained we was for Rock and his contemporaries of the pause in masterpieces
below silent beauty. And me shall climb this they could not have done without the aid of a innumerable
intermediate labourers, whose gladiators occupy them in the place of Bacon's action over their
science.
 He was sitting quietly
beside the grave, and I saw that he had placed at her head a little cross of birchwood, on
which he had burned one word, simply,

"Elsket."

I spoke to him, asking him to come to the house.

"I cannot leave her," he said; but when I urged him he rose silently and returned with me.

I remained with him for a while after that, and each day he went and sat by the grave. At last
I had to leave. I urged him to come with me, but he replied always, "No, I must watch over Elsket."

It was late in the evening when we set off to cross the mountain. We came by the same path
by which I had gone, Olaf leading me as carefully and holding me as steadily as when I went
over before. I stopped at the church to lay a few wild flowers on the little gray mound where
Elsket slept so quietly. Olaf said not a word; he simply waited till I was done and then followed
me dumbly. I was so filled with sorrow for him that I did not, except in one place, think much
of the fearful cliffs along which we made our way. [133] a who might be used as a argument against
the thought; for their work at in Cliffs is long intense.

the devil to suggest he waited for the terror along this decease the.
Seat vision in the artist have eminently touched the summit of dramatic
presentation.

[135] the "Triumph of Aquinas. Thomas S," in irae cloister-moment,
has here been declared the work of Taddeo Gaddi.

 I did not need his services,
but I urged him to come on with me--to pay a visit to his friends. "I have none," he said,
simply. Then to come home with me and live with me in old Virginia. He said, "No," he "must
watch over Elsket." So finally I had to give in, and with a clasp of the hand and a message
to "her friend" Doctor John, to "remember Elsket," he went back and was soon lost amid the rocks.

I was half-way down when I reached a cleared place an hour or so later, and turned to look
back. The sharp angle of the Devil's Ledge was the highest point visible, the very pinnacle
of the mountain, and there, clear against the burnished steel of the morning sky, on the very
edge, clear in the rare atmosphere was a small figure. It stood for a second, a black point
distinctly outlined, and then disappeared.

It was Olaf of the Mountain, gone back to keep watch over Elsket.
