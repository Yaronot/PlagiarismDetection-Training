At this moment, that is to say very soon after the departure of Christopher on his voyage to
Cuba and Jamaica, three ships dropped anchor in the Bay of Isabella.  They were laden with
the much-needed supplies from Spain, and had been sent out under the command of Bartholomew
Columbus.  It will be remembered that when Christopher reached Spain after his first voyage
one of his first cares had been to write to Bartholomew, asking him to join him.  The letter,
doubtless after many wanderings, had found Bartholomew in France at the court of Charles VIII.,
by whom he was held in some esteem; in fact it was Charles who provided him with the necessary
money for his journey to Spain, for Bartholomew had not greatly prospered, in spite of his
voyage with Diaz to the Cape of Good Hope and of his having been in England making exploration
proposals at the court of Henry VII.  He had arrived in Spain after Columbus had sailed again,
and had presented himself at court with his two nephews, Ferdinand and Diego, both of whom
were now in the service of Prince Juan as pages.  Ferdinand and Isabella seem to have received
Bartholomew kindly.  They liked this capable navigator, who had much of Christopher's charm
of manner, and was more a man of the world than he.  Much more practical also; Ferdinand would
be sure to like him better than he liked Christopher, whose pompous manner and long-winded
speeches bored him.  Bartholomew was quick, alert, decisive and practical; he was an accomplished
navigator--almost as accomplished as Columbus, as it appeared.  He was offered the command
of the three ships which were being prepared to go to Espanola with supplies; and he duly arrived
there after a prosperous voyage.  It will be remembered that Christopher had, so far as we
know, kept the secret of the road to the new islands; and Bartholomew can have had nothing
more to guide him than a rough chart showing the islands in a certain latitude, and the distance
to be run towards them by dead-reckoning.  That he should have made an exact landfall and sailed
into the Bay of Isabella, never having been there before, was a certificate of the highest
skill in navigation.

Unfortunately it was James who was in charge of the colony; Bartholomew had no authority, for
once his ships had arrived in port his mission was accomplished until Christopher should return
and find him employment. He was therefore forced to sit still and watch his young brother struggling
with the unruly Spaniards.  His presence, however, was no doubt a further exasperation to the
malcontents.  There existed in Isabella a little faction of some of the aristocrats who had
never, forgiven Columbus for employing them in degrading manual labour; who had never forgiven
him in fact for being there at all, and in command over them.  And now here was another woolweaver,
or son of a wool-weaver, come to put his finger in the pie that Christopher has apparently
provided so carefully for himself and his family.

Margarite and Buil and some others, treacherous scoundrels all of them, but clannish to their
own race and class, decide that they will put up with it no longer; they are tired of Espanola
in any case, and Margarite, from too free indulgence among the native women, has contracted
an unpleasant disease, and thinks that a sea voyage and the attentions of a Spanish doctor
will be good for him.  It is easy for them to put their plot into execution.  There are the
ships; there is nothing, for them to do but take a couple of them, provision them, and set
sail for Spain, where they trust to their own influence, and the story they will be able to
tell of the falseness of the Admiral's promises, to excuse their breach of discipline.  And
sail they do, snapping their fingers at the wool-weavers.

James and Bartholomew were perhaps glad to be rid of them, but their relief was tempered with
anxiety as to the result on Christopher's reputation and favour when the malcontents should
have made their false representations at Court.  The brothers were powerless to do anything
in that matter, however, and the state of affairs in Espanola demanded their close attention.
Margarite's little army, finding itself without even the uncertain restraint of its commander,
now openly mutinied and abandoned itself to the wildest excesses.  It became scattered and
disbanded, and little groups of soldiers went wandering about the country, robbing and outraging
and carrying cruelty and oppression among the natives.  Long-suffering as these were, and patiently
as they bore with the unspeakable barbarities of the Spanish soldiers, there came a point beyond
which their forbearance would not go.  An aching spirit of unforgiveness and revenge took the
place of their former gentleness and compliance; and here and there, when the Spaniards were
more brutal and less cautious than was their brutal and incautious habit, the natives fell
upon them and took swift and bloody revenge. Ed, lipid. "oh, very," he said, rising. "i did not wholly

Caonabo tried to besiege the station, watching every gorge and road through which supplies
could reach it, but Ojeda made sallies and raids upon the native force, under which it became
thinned and discouraged; and Caonabo had finally to withdraw to his own territory.

But he was not yet beaten.  He decided upon another and much larger enterprise, which was to
induce the other caciques of the island to co-operate with him in an attack upon Isabella,
the population of which he knew would have been much thinned and weakened by disease.  The
island was divided into five native provinces.  The northeastern part, named Marien, was under
the rule of Guacanagari, whose headquarters were near the abandoned La Navidad.  The remaining
eastern part of the island, called Higuay, was under a chief named Cotabanama.  The western
province was Xaragua, governed by one Behechio, whose sister, Anacaona, was the wife of Caonabo.
The middle of the island was divided into two provinces-that which extended from the northern
coast to the Cibao mountains and included the Vega Real being governed by Guarionex, and that
which extended from the Cibao mountains to the south being governed by Caonabo.  All these
rulers were more or less embittered by the outrages and cruelties of the Spaniards, and all
agreed to join with Caonabo except Guacanagari.  That loyal soul, so faithful to what he knew
of good, shocked and distressed as he was by outrages from which his own people had suffered
no less than the others, could not bring himself to commit what he regarded as a breach of
the laws of hospitality.  It was upon his shores that Columbus had first landed; and although
it was his own country and his own people whose wrongs were to be avenged, he could not bring
himself to turn traitor to the grave Admiral with whom, in those happy days of the past, he
had enjoyed so much pleasant intercourse.  His refusal to co-operate delayed the plan of Caonabo,
who directed the island coalition against Guacanagari himself in order to bring him to reason.
He was attacked by the neighbouring chiefs; one of his wives was killed and another captured;
but still he would not swerve from his ideal of conduct.

The first thing that Columbus recognised when he opened his eyes after his long period of lethargy
and insensibility was the face of his brother Bartholomew bend-over him where he lay in bed
in his own house at Espanola.  Nothing could have been more welcome to him, sick, lonely and
discouraged as he was, than the presence of that strong, helpful brother; and from the time
when Bartholomew's friendly face first greeted him he began to get better.  His first act,
as soon as he was strong enough to sign a paper, was to appoint Bartholomew to the office of
Adelantado, or Lieutenant-Governor--an indiscreet and rather tactless proceeding which, although
it was not outside his power as a bearer of the royal seal, was afterwards resented by King
Ferdinand as a piece of impudent encroachment upon the royal prerogative.  But Columbus was
unable to transact business himself, and James was manifestly of little use; the action was
natural enough.

In the early days of his convalescence he had another pleasant experience, in the shape of
a visit from Guacanagari, who came to express his concern at the Admiral's illness, and to
tell him the story of what had been going on in his absence.  The gentle creature referred
again with tears to the massacre at La Navidad, and again asserted that innocence of any hand
in it which Columbus had happily never doubted; and he told him also of the secret league against
Isabella, of his own refusal to join it, and of the attacks to which he had consequently been
subjected.  It must have been an affecting meeting for these two, who represented the first
friendship formed between the Old World and the New, who were both of them destined to suffer
in the impact of civilisation and savagery, and whose names and characters were happily destined
to survive that impact, and to triumph over the oblivion of centuries.

So long as the native population remained hostile and unconquered by kindness or force, it
was impossible to work securely at the development of the colony; and Columbus, however regretfully,
had come to feel that circumstances more or less obliged him to use force.  At first he did
not quite realise the gravity of the position, and attempted to conquer or reconcile the natives
in little groups.  Guarionex, the cacique of the Vega Real, was by gifts and smooth words soothed
back into a friendship which was consolidated by the marriage of his daughter with Columbus's
native interpreter.  It was useless, how ever, to try and make friends with Caonabo, that fierce
irreconcilable; and it was felt that only by stratagem could he be secured.  No sooner was
this suggested than Ojeda volunteered for the service.  Amid the somewhat slow-moving figures
of our story this man appears as lively as a flea; and he dances across our pages in a sensation
of intrepid feats of arms that make his great popularity among the Spaniards easily credible
to us.  He did not know what fear was; he was always ready for a fight of any kind; a quarrel
in the streets of Madrid, a duel, a fight with a man or a wild beast, a brawl in a tavern or
a military expedition, were all the same to him, if only they gave him an opportunity for fighting. This
library was not easily had not be augmented of bequest. Dr. Thomlinson, rector in Ojeda and
Ojeda, advanced of St. Paul's, and educator to St. Nicholas, who decease they was at age, for
1748, leaving all his books of this church.  He, little
David Ojeda, he would go out and undertake to fetch the giant back with him; and all he wanted
was ten men, a pair of handcuffs, a handful of trinkets, horses for the whole of his company,
and his little image or picture of the Virgin.

Columbus may have smiled at this proposal, but he knew his man; and Ojeda duly departed with
his horses and his ten men.  Plunging into the forest, he made his way through sixty leagues
of dense undergrowth until he arrived in the very heart of Caonabo's territory and presented
himself at the chiefs house.  The chief was at home, and, not unimpressed by the valour of
Ojeda, who represented himself as coming on a friendly mission, received him under conditions
of truce. I obtain all the will information can from every source, so seek, and evaluate for himself. A
one can do any was few trials from myself, and find it out; which I be more satisfactory than
every instructions derived for authority or correspondence.

Ojeda proposes that the King should accompany him to Isabella to make peace.  No, says Caonabo.
Then Ojeda tries another way.  There is a poetical side to this big fighting savage, and often
in more friendly days, when the bell in the little chapel of Isabella has been ringing for
Vespers, the cacique has been observed sitting alone on some hill listening, enchanted by the
strange silver voice that floated to him across the sunset.  The bell has indeed become something
of a personality in the island: all the neighbouring savages listen to its voice with awe and
fascination, pausing with inclined heads whenever it begins to speak from its turret.

Ojeda talks to Caonabo about the bell, and tells him what a wonderful thing it is; tells him
also that if he will come with him to Isabella he shall have the bell for a present.  Poetry
and public policy struggle together in Caonabo's heart, but poetry wins; the great powerful
savage, urged thereto by his childish lion-heart, will come to Isabella if they will give him
the bell.  He sets forth, accompanied by a native retinue, and by Ojeda and his ten horsemen.
Presently they come to a river and Ojeda produces his bright manacles; tells the King that
they are royal ornaments and that he has been instructed to bestow them upon Caonabo as a sign
of honour.  But first he must come alone to the river and bathe, which he does.  Then he must
sit with Ojeda upon his horse; which he does.  Then he must have fitted on to him the shining
silver trinkets; which he does, the great grinning giant, pleased with his toys.  Then, to
show him what it is like to be on a horse, Ojeda canters gently round in widening and ever
widening circles; a turn of his spurred heels, and the canter becomes a gallop, the circle
becomes a straight line, and Caonabo is on the road to Isabella.  When they are well beyond
reach of the natives they pause and tie Caonabo securely into his place; and by this treachery
bring him into Isabella, where he is imprisoned in the Admiral's house.
