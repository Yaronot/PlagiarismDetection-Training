A deep sound, which, in the confusion of my senses, I identified with the cries of the rioters,
was the first thing of which I was sensible; next, I became conscious that I was carried violently
forward in some conveyance, with an unequal motion, which gave me much pain. My position was
horizontal, and when I attempted to stretch my hands in order to find some mode of securing
myself against this species of suffering, I found I was bound as before, and the horrible reality
rushed on my mind that I was in the hands of those who had lately committed a great outrage
on property, and were now about to kidnap, if not to murder me. I opened my eyes, it was to
no purpose--all around me was dark, for a day had passed over during my captivity. A dispiriting
sickness oppressed my head--my heart seemed on fire, while my feet and hands were chilled and
benumbed with want of circulation. It was with the utmost difficulty that I at length, and
gradually, recovered in a sufficient degree the power of observing external sounds and circumstances;
and when I did so, they presented nothing consolatory.

Groping with my hands, as far as the bandages would permit, and receiving the assistance of
some occasional glances of the moonlight, I became aware that the carriage in which I was transported
was one of the light carts of the country, called TUMBLERS, and that a little attention had
been paid to my accommodation, as I was laid upon some sacks covered with matting, and filled
with straw. Without these, my condition would have been still more intolerable, for the vehicle,
sinking now on one side, and now on the other, sometimes sticking absolutely fast and requiring
the utmost exertions of the animal which drew it to put it once more in motion, was subjected
to jolts in all directions, which were very severe. At other times it rolled silently and smoothly
over what seemed to be wet sand; and, as I heard the distant roar of the tide, I had little
doubt that we were engaged in passing the formidable estuary which divides the two kingdoms.

There seemed to be at least five or six people about the cart, some on foot, others on horseback;
the former lent assistance whenever it was in danger of upsetting, or sticking fast in the
quicksand; the others rode before and acted as guides, often changing the direction of the
vehicle as the precarious state of the passage required.

I addressed myself to the men around the cart, and endeavoured to move their compassion. I
had harmed, I said, no one, and for no action in my life had deserved such cruel treatment,
I had no concern whatever in the fishing station which had incurred their displeasure, and
my acquaintance with Mr. Geddes was of a very late date. Lastly, and as my strongest argument,
I endeavoured to excite their fears, by informing them that my rank in life would not permit
me to be either murdered or secreted with impunity; and to interest their avarice, by the promises
I made them of reward, if they would effect my deliverance. I only received a scornful laugh
in reply to my threats; my promises might have done more, for the fellows were whispering together
as if in hesitation, and I began to reiterate and increase my offers, when the voice of one
of the horsemen, who had suddenly come up, enjoined silence to the men on foot, and, approaching
the side of the cart, said to me, with a strong and determined voice, 'Young man, there is
no personal harm designed to you. If you remain silent and quiet, you may reckon on good treatment;
but if you endeavour to tamper with these men in the execution of their duty, I will take such
measures for silencing you, as you shall remember the longest day you have to live.'

I thought I knew the voice which uttered these threats; but, in such a situation, my perceptions
could not be supposed to be perfectly accurate. I was contented to reply, 'Whoever you are
that speak to me, I entreat the benefit of the meanest prisoner, who is not to be subjected,
legally to greater hardship than is necessary for the restraint of his person. I entreat that
these bonds, which hurt me so cruelly, may be slackened at least, if not removed altogether.'

'I will slacken the belts,' said the former speaker; 'nay, I will altogether remove them, and
allow you to pursue your journey in a more convenient manner, provided you will give me your
word of honour that you will not attempt an escape?'

'NEVER!' I answered, with an energy of which despair alone could have rendered me capable--'I
will never submit to loss of freedom a moment longer than I am subjected to it by force.'

'Enough,' he replied; 'the sentiment is natural; but do not on your side complain that I, who
am carrying on an important undertaking, use the only means in my power for ensuring its success.'

I entreated to know what it was designed to do with me; but my conductor, in a voice of menacing
authority, desired me to be silent on my peril; and my strength and spirits were too much exhausted
to permit my continuing a dialogue so singular, even if I could have promised myself any good
result by doing so.

It is proper here to add, that, from my recollections at the time, and from what has since
taken place, I have the strongest possible belief that the man with whom I held this expostulation
was the singular person residing at Brokenburn, in Dumfriesshire, and called by the fishers
of that hamlet, the Laird of the Solway Lochs. The cause for his inveterate persecution I cannot
pretend even to guess at.

In the meantime, the cart was dragged heavily and wearily on, until the nearer roar of the
advancing tide excited the apprehension of another danger. I could not mistake the sound, which
I had heard upon another occasion, when it was only the speed of a fleet horse which saved
me from perishing in the quicksands. Thou, my dear Alan, canst not but remember the former
circumstances; and now, wonderful contrast! the very man, to the best of my belief, who then
saved me from peril, was the leader of the lawless band who had deprived me of my liberty.
I conjectured that the danger grew imminent; for I heard some words and circumstances which
made me aware that a rider hastily fastened his own horse to the shafts of the cart in order
to assist the exhausted animal which drew it, and the vehicle was now pulled forward at a faster
pace, which the horses were urged to maintain by blows and curses. S. It.

 Cristal Nixon may say his worst on
thee; but thou art a civil gentleman for all him; and a quoit man wi' woman folk loike.'

There is no sense in being too quiet with women folk, so I added a kiss with my crown piece;
and I cannot help thinking that I have secured a partisan in Dorcas. At least, she blushed,
and pocketed her little compliment with one hand, while, with the other, she adjusted her cherry-coloured
ribbons, a little disordered by the struggle it cost me to attain the honour of a salute.

As she unlocked the door to leave the apartment, she turned back, and looking on me with a
strong expression of compassion, added the remarkable words, 'La--be'st mad or no, thou'se
a mettled lad, after all.'

There was something very ominous in the sound of these farewell words, which seemed to afford
me a clue to the pretext under which I was detained in confinement, My demeanour was probably
insane enough, while I was agitated at once by the frenzy incident to the fever, and the anxiety
arising from my extraordinary situation. But is it possible they can now establish any cause
for confining me arising out of the state of my mind?

If this be really the pretext under which I am restrained from my liberty, nothing but the
sedate correctness of my conduct can remove the prejudices which these circumstances may have
excited in the minds of all who have approached me during my illness. I have heard--dreadful
thought!--of men who, for various reasons, have been trepanned into the custody of the keepers
of private madhouses, and whose brain, after years of misery, became at length unsettled, through
irresistible sympathy with the wretched beings among whom they were classed. This shall not
be my case, if, by strong internal resolution, it is in human nature to avoid the action of
exterior and contagious sympathies.

Meantime I sat down to compose and arrange my thoughts, for my purposed appeal to my jailer--so
I must call him--whom I addressed in the following manner; having at length, and after making
several copies, found language to qualify the sense of resentment which burned in the first,
drafts of my letter, and endeavoured to assume a tone more conciliating. I mentioned the two
occasions on which he had certainly saved my life, when at the utmost peril; and I added, that
whatever was the purpose of the restraint, now practised on me, as I was given to understand,
by his authority, it could not certainly be with any view to ultimately injuring me. He might,
I said, have mistaken me for some other person; and I gave him what account I could of my situation
and education, to correct such an error. I supposed it next possible, that he might think me
too weak for travelling, and not capable of taking care of myself; and I begged to assure him,
that I was restored to perfect health, and quite able to endure the fatigue of a journey. Lastly,
I reminded him, in firm though measured terms, that the restraint which I sustained was an
illegal one, and highly punishable by the laws which protect the liberties of the subject.
I ended by demanding that he would take me before a magistrate; or, at least, that he would
favour me with a personal interview and explain his meaning with regard to me.

Perhaps this letter was expressed in a tone too humble for the situation of an injured man,
and I am inclined to think so when I again recapitulate its tenor. But what could I do? I was
in the power of one whose passions seem as violent as his means of gratifying them appear unbounded.
I had reason, too, to believe (this to thee, Alan) that all his family did not approve of the
violence of his conduct towards me; my object, in fine, was freedom, and who would not sacrifice
much to attain it?

I had no means of addressing my letter excepting 'For the Squire's own hand.' He could be at
no great distance, for in the course of twenty-four hours I received an answer. It was addressed
to Darsie Latimer, and contained these words: 'You have demanded an interview with me. You
have required to be carried before a magistrate. Your first wish shall be granted--perhaps
the second also. Meanwhile, be assured that you are a prisoner for the time, by competent authority,
and that such authority is supported by adequate power. Beware, therefore, of struggling with
a force sufficient to crush you, but abandon yourself to that train of events by which we are
both swept along, and which it is impossible that either of us can resist.'

These mysterious words were without signature of any kind, and left me nothing more important
to do than to prepare myself for the meeting which they promised. For that purpose I must now
break off, and make sure of the manuscript--so far as I can, in my present condition, be sure
of anything--by concealing it within the lining of my coat, so as not to be found without strict
search.

CHAPTER VI

LATIMER'S JOURNAL, IN CONTINUATION

The important interview expected at the conclusion of my last took place sooner than I had
calculated; for the very day I received the letter, and just when my dinner was finished, the
squire, or whatever he is called, entered the room so suddenly that I almost thought I beheld
an apparition. The figure of this man is peculiarly noble and stately, and his voice has that
deep fullness of accent which implies unresisted authority. I had risen involuntarily as he
entered; we gazed on each other for a moment in silence, which was at length broken by my visitor.

'You have desired to see me,' he said. 'I am here; if you have aught to say let me hear it;
my time is too brief to be consumed in childish dumb-show.'

'I would ask of you,' said I, 'by what authority I am detained in this place of confinement,
and for what purpose?'

'I have told you already,' said he, 'that my authority is sufficient, and my power equal to
it; this is all which it is necessary for you at present to know.'

'Every British subject has a right to know why he suffers restraint,' I replied; 'nor can he
be deprived of liberty without a legal warrant. Show me that by which you confine me thus.'

'You shall see more,' he said; 'you shall see the magistrate by whom it is granted, and that
without a moment's delay.'

This sudden proposal fluttered and alarmed me; I felt, nevertheless, that I had the right cause,
and resolved to plead it boldly, although I could well have desired a little further time for
preparation. He turned, however, threw open the door of the apartment, and commanded me to
follow him. I felt some inclination, when I crossed the threshold of my prison-chamber, to
have turned and run for it; but I knew not where to find the stairs--had reason to think the
outer doors would be secured and, to conclude, so soon as I had quitted the room to follow
the proud step of my conductor, I observed that I was dogged by Cristal Nixon, who suddenly
appeared within two paces of me, and with whose great personal strength, independent of the
assistance he might have received from his master, I saw no chance of contending. I therefore
followed, unresistingly and in silence; along one or two passages of much greater length than
consisted with the ideas I had previously entertained of the size of the house. At length a
door was flung open, and we entered a large, old-fashioned parlour, having coloured glass in
the windows, oaken panelling on the wall, a huge grate, in which a large faggot or two smoked
under an arched chimney-piece of stone which bore some armorial device, whilst the walls were
adorned with the usual number of heroes in armour, with large wigs instead of helmets, and
ladies in sacques, smelling to nosegays.

Behind a long table, on which were several books, sat a smart underbred-looking man, wearing
his own hair tied in a club, and who, from the quire of paper laid before him, and the pen
which he handled at my entrance, seemed prepared to officiate as clerk. As I wish to describe
these persons as accurately as possible, I may add, he wore a dark-coloured coat, corduroy
breeches, and spatterdashes. At the upper end of the same table, in an ample easy-chair covered
with black leather, reposed a fat personage, about fifty years old, who either was actually
a country justice, or was well selected to represent such a character. His leathern breeches
were faultless in make, his jockey boots spotless in the varnish, and a handsome and flourishing
pair of boot-garters, as they are called, united the one part of his garments to the other;
in fine, a richly-laced scarlet waistcoat and a purple coat set off the neat though corpulent
figure of the little man, and threw an additional bloom upon his plethoric aspect. I suppose
he had dined, for it was two hours past noon, and he was amusing himself, and aiding digestion,
with a pipe of tobacco. There was an air of importance in his manner which corresponded to
the rural dignity of his exterior, and a habit which he had of throwing out a number of interjectional
sounds, uttered with a strange variety of intonation running from bass up to treble in a very
extraordinary manner, or breaking off his sentences with a whiff of his pipe, seemed adopted
to give an air of thought and mature deliberation to his opinions and decisions. Notwithstanding
all this, Alan, it might be DOOTED, as our old Professor used to say, whether the Justice was
anything more then an ass. Certainly, besides a great deference for the legal opinion of his
clerk, which might be quite according to the order of things, he seemed to be wonderfully under
the command of his brother squire, if squire either of them were, and indeed much more than
was consistent with so much assumed consequence of his own.

'Ho--ha--aye--so--so--hum--humph--this is the young man, I suppose--hum--aye--seems sickly.
Young gentleman, you may sit down.'

I used the permission given, for I had been much more reduced by my illness than I was aware
of, and felt myself really fatigued, even by the few paces I had walked, joined to the agitation
I suffered.

'And your name, young man, is--humph--aye--ha--what is it?'

'Darsie Latimer.'

'Right--aye--humph--very right. Darsie Latimer is the very thing--ha--aye--where do you come from?'

'From Scotland, sir,' I replied.

'A native of Scotland--a--humph--eh--how is it?'

'I am an Englishman by birth, sir.'

'Right--aye--yes, you are so. But pray, Mr. Darsie Latimer, have you always been called by
that name, or have you any other?--Nick, write down his answers, Nick.'

'As far as I remember, I never bore any other,' was my answer.

'How, no? well, I should not have thought so, Hey, neighbour, would you?'

Here he looked towards the other squire, who had thrown himself into a chair; and, with his
legs stretched out before him, and his arms folded on his bosom, seemed carelessly attending
to what was going forward. He answered the appeal of the Justice by saying, that perhaps the
young man's memory did not go back to a very early period.

'Ah--eh--ha--you hear the gentleman. Pray, how far may your memory be pleased to run back to?--umph?'

'Perhaps, sir, to the age of three years, or a little further.'

'And will you presume to say, sir,' said the squire, drawing himself suddenly erect in his
seat, and exerting the strength of his powerful voice, 'that you then bore your present name?'

I was startled at the confidence with which this question was put, and in vain rummaged my
memory for the means of replying. 'At least,' I said, 'I always remember being called Darsie;
children, at that early age, seldom get more than their Christian name.'

'Oh, I thought so,' he replied, and again stretched himself on his seat, in the same lounging
posture as before.

'So you were called Darsie in your infancy,' said the Justice; 'and--hum--aye--when did you
first take the name of Latimer?'

'I did not take it, sir; it was given to me.'

'I ask you,' said the lord of the mansion, but with less severity in his voice than formerly,
'whether you can remember that you were ever called Latimer, until you had that name given
you in Scotland?'

'I will be candid: I cannot recollect an instance that I was so called when in England, but
neither can I recollect when the name was first given me; and if anything is to be founded
on these queries and my answers, I desire my early childhood may be taken into consideration.'

'Hum--aye--yes,' said the Justice; 'all that requires consideration shall be duly considered.
Young man--eh--I beg to know the name of your father and mother?'

This was galling a wound that has festered for years, and I did not endure the question so
patiently as those which preceded it; but replied, 'I demand, in my turn, to know if I am before
an English Justice of the Peace?'

'His worship, Squire Foxley, of Foxley Hall, has been of the quorum these twenty years,' said
Master Nicholas.

'Then he ought to know, or you, sir, as his clerk, should inform him,' said I, 'that I am the
complainer in this case, and that my complaint ought to be heard before I am subjected to cross-examination.'

'Humph--hoy--what, aye--there is something in that, neighbour,' said the poor Justice, who,
blown about by every wind of doctrine, seemed desirous to attain the sanction of his brother
squire.

'I wonder at you, Foxley,' said his firm-minded acquaintance; 'how can you render the young
man justice unless you know who he is?'

'Ha--yes--egad, that's true,' said Mr. Justice Foxley; 'and now--looking into the matter more
closely--there is, eh, upon the whole--nothing at all in what he says--so, sir, you must tell
your father's name, and surname.'

'It is out of my power, sir; they are not known to me, since you must needs know so much of
my private affairs.'

The Justice collected a great AFFLATUS in his cheeks, which puffed them up like those of a
Dutch cherub, while his eyes seemed flying out of his head, from the effort with which he retained
his breath. He then blew it forth with,--'Whew!--Hoom--poof--ha!--not know your parents, youngster?--Then
I must commit you for a vagrant, I warrant you. OMNE IGNOTUM PRO TERRIBILI, as we used to say
at Appleby school; that is, every one that is not known to the Justice; is a rogue and a vagabond.
Ha!--aye, you may sneer, sir; but I question if you would have known the meaning of that Latin,
unless I had told you.'

I acknowledged myself obliged for a new edition of the adage, and an interpretation which I
could never have reached alone and unassisted. I then proceeded to state my case with greater
confidence. The Justice was an ass, that was clear; but if was scarcely possible he could be
so utterly ignorant as not to know what was necessary in so plain a case as mine. I therefore
informed him of the riot which had been committed on the Scottish side of the Solway Firth,
explained how I came to be placed in my present situation, and requested of his worship to
set me at liberty. I pleaded my cause with as much earnestness as I could, casting an eye from
time to time upon the opposite party, who seemed entirely indifferent to all the animation
with which I accused him.

As for the Justice, when at length I had ceased, as really not knowing what more to say in
a case so very plain, he replied, 'Ho--aye--aye--yes--wonderful! and so this is all the gratitude
you show to this good gentleman for the great charge and trouble he hath had with respect to
and concerning of you?'

'He saved my life, sir, I acknowledge, on one occasion certainly, and most probably on two;
but his having done so gives him no right over my person. I am not, however, asking for any
punishment or revenge; on the contrary, I am content to part friends with the gentleman, whose
motives I am unwilling to suppose are bad, though his actions have been, towards me, unauthorized
and violent.'

This moderation, Alan, thou wilt comprehend, was not entirely dictated by my feelings towards
the individual of whom I complained; there were other reasons, in which regard for him had
little share. It seemed, however, as if the mildness with which I pleaded my cause had more
effect upon him than anything I had yet said. We was moved to the point of being almost out
of countenance; and took snuff repeatedly, as if to gain time to stifle some degree of emotion.

But on Justice Foxley, on whom my eloquence was particularly designed to make impression, the
result was much less favourable. He consulted in a whisper with Mr. Nicholas, his clerk--pshawed,
hemmed, and elevated his eyebrows, as if in scorn of my supplication. At length, having apparently
made up his mind, he leaned back in his chair, and smoked his pipe with great energy, with
a look of defiance, designed to make me aware that all my reasoning was lost on him.

At length, when I stopped, more from lack of breath than want of argument, he opened his oracular
jaws, and made the following reply, interrupted by his usual interjectional ejaculations, and
by long volumes of smoke:--'Hem--aye--eh--poof. And, youngster, do you think Matthew Foxley,
who has been one of the quorum for these twenty years, is to be come over with such trash as
would hardly cheat an apple-woman? Poof--poof--eh! Why, man--eh--dost thou not know the charge
is not a bailable matter--and that--hum--aye--the greatest man--poof--the Baron of Graystock
himself, must stand committed? and yet you pretend to have been kidnapped by this gentleman,
and robbed of property, and what not; and--eh--poof--you would persuade me all you want is
to get away from him? I do believe--eh--that it IS all you want. Therefore, as you are a sort
of a slip-string gentleman, and--aye--hum--a kind of idle apprentice, and something cock-brained
withal, as the honest folks of the house tell me--why, you must e'en remain under custody of
your guardian, till your coming of age, or my Lord Chancellor's warrant, shall give you the
management of your own affairs, which, if you can gather your brains again, you will even then
not be--aye--hem--poof--in particular haste to assume.'

The time occupied by his worship's hums, and haws, and puffs of tobacco smoke, together with
the slow and pompous manner in which he spoke, gave me a minute's space to collect my ideas,
dispersed as they were by the extraordinary purport of this annunciation.

'I cannot conceive, sir,' I replied, 'by what singular tenure this person claims my obedience
as a guardian; it is a barefaced imposture. I never in my life saw him, until I came unhappily
to this country, about four weeks since.'

'Aye, sir--we--eh--know, and are aware--that--poof--you do not like to hear some folk's names;
and that--eh--you understand me--there are things, and sounds, and matters, conversation about
names, and suchlike, which put you off the hooks--which I have no humour to witness. Nevertheless,
Mr. Darsie--or--poof--Mr. Darsie Latimer--or--poof, poof--eh--aye, Mr. Darsie without the Latimer--you
have acknowledged as much to-day as assures me you will best be disposed of under the honourable
care of my friend here--all your confessions--besides that, poof--eh--I know him to be a most
responsible person--a--hay--aye--most responsible and honourable person--Can you deny this?'

'I know nothing of him,' I repeated; 'not even his name; and I have not, as I told you, seen
him in the course of my whole life, till a few weeks since.'

'Will you swear to that?' said the singular man, who seemed to await the result of this debate,
secure as a rattle-snake is of the prey which has once felt its fascination. And while he said
these words in deep undertone, he withdrew his chair a little behind that of the Justice, so
as to be unseen by him or his clerk, who sat upon the same side; while he bent on me a frown
so portentous, that no one who has witnessed the look can forget it during the whole of his
life. The furrows of the brow above the eyes became livid and almost black, and were bent into
a semicircular, or rather elliptical form, above the junction of the eyebrows. I had heard
such a look described in an old tale of DIABLERIE, which it was my chance to be entertained
with not long since; when this deep and gloomy contortion of the frontal muscles was not unaptly
described as forming the representation of a small horseshoe.

The tale, when told, awaked a dreadful vision of infancy, which the withering and blighting
look now fixed on me again forced on my recollection, but with much more vivacity. Indeed,
I was so much surprised, and, I must add, terrified, at the vague ideas which were awakened
in my mind by this fearful sign, that I kept my eyes fixed on the face in which it was exhibited,
as on a frightful vision; until, passing his handkerchief a moment across his countenance,
this mysterious man relaxed at once the look which had for me something so appalling. 'The
young man will no longer deny that he has seen me before,' said he to the Justice, in a tone
of complacency; 'and I trust he will now be reconciled to my temporary guardianship, which
may end better for him than he expects.'

'Whatever I expect,' I replied, summoning my scattered recollections together, 'I see I am
neither to expect justice nor protection from this gentleman, whose office it is to render
both to the lieges. For you, sir, how strangely you have wrought yourself into the fate of
an unhappy young man or what interest you can pretend in me, you yourself only can explain.
That I have seen you before is certain; for none can forget the look with which you seem to
have the power of blighting those upon whom you cast it.'

The Justice seemed not very easy under this hint,'Ha!--aye,' he said; 'it is time to be going,
neighbour. I have a many miles to ride, and I care not to ride darkling in these parts. You
and I, Mr. Nicholas, must be jogging.'

The Justice fumbled with his gloves, in endeavouring to draw them on hastily, and Mr. Nicholas
bustled to get his greatcoat and whip. Their landlord endeavoured to detain them, and spoke
of supper and beds. Both, pouring forth many thanks for his invitation, seemed as if they would
much rather not, and Mr. Justice Foxley was making a score of apologies, with at least a hundred
cautionary hems and eh-ehs, when the girl Dorcas burst into the room, and announced a gentleman
on justice business.

'What gentleman?--and whom does he want?'

'He is cuome post on his ten toes,' said the wench; 'and on justice business to his worship
loike. I'se uphald him a gentleman, for he speaks as good Latin as the schule-measter; but,
lack-a-day! he has gotten a queer mop of a wig.'

The gentleman, thus announced and described, bounced into the room. But I have already written
as much as fills a sheet of my paper, and my singular embarrassments press so hard on me that
I have matter to fill another from what followed the intrusion of--my dear Alan--your crazy
client--Poor Peter Peebles!

CHAPTER VII

LATIMER'S JOURNAL, IN CONTINUATION

Sheet 2.

I have rarely in my life, till the last alarming days, known what it was to sustain a moment's
real sorrow. What I called such, was, I am now well convinced, only the weariness of mind which,
having nothing actually present to complain of, turns upon itself and becomes anxious about
the past and the future; those periods with which human life has so little connexion, that
Scripture itself hath said, 'Sufficient for the day is the evil thereof.'

If, therefore, I have sometimes abused prosperity, by murmuring at my unknown birth and uncertain
rank in society, I will make amends by bearing my present real adversity with patience and
courage, and, if I can, even with gaiety. What can they--dare they-do to me? Foxley, I am persuaded,
is a real Justice of Peace, and country gentleman of estate, though (wonderful to tell!) he
is an ass notwithstanding; and his functionary in the drab coat must have a shrewd guess at
the consequences of being accessory to an act of murder or kidnapping. Men invite not such
witnesses to deeds of darkness. I have also--Alan, I have hopes, arising out of the family
of the oppressor himself. I am encouraged to believe that G.M. is likely again to enter on
the field. More I dare not here say; nor must I drop a hint which another eye than thine might
be able to construe. Enough, my feelings are lighter than they have been; and, though fear
and wonder are still around me, they are unable entirely to overcloud the horizon.

Even when I saw the spectral form of the old scarecrow of the Parliament House rush into the
apartment where I had undergone so singular an examination, I thought of thy connexion with
him, and could almost have parodied Lear--

  Death!--nothing could have thus subdued nature
  To such a lowness, but his 'learned lawyers.'

He was e'en as we have seen him of yore, Alan, when, rather to keep thee company than to follow
my own bent, I formerly frequented the halls of justice. The only addition to his dress, in
the capacity of a traveller, was a pair of boots, that seemed as if they might have seen the
field of Sheriffmoor; so large and heavy that, tied as they were to the creature's wearied
hams with large bunches of worsted tape of various colours, they looked as if he had been dragging
them along, either for a wager or by way of penance.

Regardless of the surprised looks of the party on whom he thus intruded himself, Peter blundered
into the middle of the apartment, with his head charged like a ram's in the act of butting,
and saluted them thus:--

'Gude day to ye, gude day to your honours. Is't here they sell the fugie warrants?'

I observed that on his entrance, my friend--or enemy--drew himself back, and placed himself
as if he would rather avoid attracting the observation of the new-comer. I did the same myself,
as far as I was able; for I thought it likely that Mr. Peebles might recognize me, as indeed
I was too frequently among the group of young juridical aspirants who used to amuse themselves
by putting cases for Peter's solution, and playing him worse tricks; yet I was uncertain whether
I had better avail myself of our acquaintance to have the advantage, such as it might be, of
his evidence before the magistrate, or whether to make him, if possible, bearer of a letter
which might procure me more effectual assistance. I resolved, therefore, to be guided by circumstances,
and to watch carefully that nothing might escape me. I drew back as far as I could, and even
reconnoitred the door and passage, to consider whether absolute escape might not be practicable.
But there paraded Cristal Nixon, whose little black eyes, sharp as those of a basilisk, seemed,
the instant when they encountered mine, to penetrate my purpose.

I sat down, as much out of sight of all parties as I could, and listened to the dialogue which
followed--a dialogue how much more interesting to me than any I could have conceived, in which
Peter Peebles was to be one of the dramatis personae!

'Is it here where ye sell the warrants--the fugies, ye ken?' said Peter.

'Hey--eh--what!' said Justice Foxley; 'what the devil does the fellow mean?--What would you
have a warrant for?'

'It is to apprehend a young lawyer that is IN MEDITATIONE FUGAE; for he has ta'en my memorial
and pleaded my cause, and a good fee I gave him, and as muckle brandy as he could drink that
day at his father's house--he loes the brandy ower weel for sae youthful a creature.'

'And what has this drunken young dog of a lawyer done to you, that you are come to me--eh--ha?
Has he robbed you? Not unlikely if he be a lawyer--eh--Nick--ha?' said Justice Foxley.

'He has robbed me of himself, sir,' answered Peter; 'of his help, comfort, aid, maintenance,
and assistance, whilk, as a counsel to a client, he is bound to yield me RATIONE OFFICII--that
is it, ye see. He has pouched my fee, and drucken a mutchkin of brandy, and now he's ower the
march, and left my cause, half won half lost--as dead a heat as e'er was run ower the back-sands.
Now, I was advised by some cunning laddies that are used to crack a bit law wi' me in the House,
that the best thing I could do was to take heart o' grace and set out after him; so I have
taken post on my ain shanks, forby a cast in a cart, or the like. I got wind of him in Dumfries,
and now I have run him ower to the English side, and I want a fugie warrant against him.'

How did my heart throb at this information, dearest Alan! Thou art near me then, and I well
know with what kind purpose; thou hast abandoned all to fly to my assistance; and no wonder
that, knowing thy friendship and faith, thy sound sagacity and persevering disposition, 'my
bosom's lord should now sit lightly on his throne'; that gaiety should almost involuntarily
hover on my pen; and that my heart should beat like that of a general, responsive to the drums
of his advancing ally, without whose help the battle must have been lost.

I did not suffer myself to be startled by this joyous surprise, but continued to bend my strictest
attention to what followed among this singular party. That Poor Peter Peebles had been put
on this wildgoose chase by some of his juvenile advisers in the Parliament House, he himself
had intimated; but he spoke with much confidence, and the Justice, who seemed to have some
secret apprehension of being put to trouble in the matter, and, as sometimes occurs on the
English frontier, a jealousy lest the superior acuteness of their northern neighbours might
overreach their own simplicity, turned to his clerk with a perplexed countenance.

'Eh--oh--Nick--d--n thee--Hast thou got nothing to say? This is more Scots law, I take it,
and more Scotsmen.' (Here he cast a side-glance at the owner of the mansion, and winked to
his clerk.) 'I would Solway were as deep as it is wide, and we had then some chance of keeping
of them out.'

Nicholas conversed an instant aside with the supplicant, and then reported:--

'The man wants a border-warrant, I think; but they are only granted for debt--now he wants
one to catch a lawyer.'

'And what for no?' answered Peter Peebles, doggedly; 'what for no, I would be glad to ken?
If a day's labourer refuse to work, ye'll grant a warrant to gar him do out his daurg--if a
wench quean rin away from her hairst, ye'll send her back to her heuck again--if sae mickle
as a collier or a salter make a moonlight flitting, ye will cleek him by the back-spaul in
a minute of time--and yet the damage canna amount to mair than a creelfu' of coals, and a forpit
or twa of saut; and here is a chield taks leg from his engagement, and damages me to the tune
of sax thousand punds sterling; that is, three thousand that I should win, and three thousand
mair that I am like to lose; and you that ca' yourself a justice canna help a poor man to catch
the rinaway? A bonny like justice I am like to get amang ye!'

'The fellow must be drunk,' said the clerk.

'Black fasting from all but sin,' replied the supplicant; 'I havena had mair than a mouthful
of cauld water since I passed the Border, and deil a ane of ye is like to say to me, "Dog,
will ye drink?"'

The Justice seemed moved by this appeal. 'Hem---tush, man,' replied he; 'thou speak'st to us
as if thou wert in presence of one of thine own beggarly justices--get downstairs--get something
to eat, man (with permission of my friend to make so free in his house), and a mouthful to
drink, and I warrant we get ye such justice as will please ye.'

'I winna refuse your neighbourly offer,' said Poor Peter Peebles, making his bow; 'muckle grace
be wi' your honour, and wisdom to guide you in this extraordinary cause.'

When I saw Peter Peebles about to retire from the room, I could not forbear an effort to obtain
from him such evidence as might give me some credit with the Justice. I stepped forward, therefore,
and, saluting him, asked him if he remembered me?

After a stare or two, and a long pinch of snuff, recollection seemed suddenly to dawn on Peter
Peebles. 'Recollect ye!' he said; 'by my troth do I.---Haud him a grip, gentlemen!--constables,
keep him fast! where that ill-deedie hempy is, ye are sure that Alan Fairford is not far off.
Haud him fast, Master Constable; I charge ye wi' him, for I am mista'en if he is not at the
bottom of this rinaway business. He was aye getting the silly callant Alan awa wi' gigs, and
horse, and the like of that, to Roslin, and Prestonpans, and a' the idle gates he could think
of. He's a rinaway apprentice, that ane.'

'Mr. Peebles,' I said, 'do not do me wrong. I am sure you can say no harm of me justly, but
can satisfy these gentlemen, if you will, that I am a student of law in Edinburgh--Darsie Latimer
by name.'

'Me satisfy! how can I satisfy the gentlemen,' answered Peter, 'that am sae far from being
satisfied mysell? I ken naething about your name, and can only testify, NIHIL NOVIT IN CAUSA.'

'A pretty witness you have brought forward in your favour,' said Mr. Foxley. 'But--ha--aye---I'll
ask him a question or two. Pray, friend, will you take your oath to this youth being a runaway
apprentice?'

'Sir,' said Peter, 'I will make oath to onything in reason; when a case comes to my oath it's
a won cause: But I am in some haste to prie your worship's good cheer;' for Peter had become
much more respectful in his demeanour towards the Justice since he had heard some intimation
of dinner.

'You shall have--eh--hum--aye--a bellyful, if it be possible to fill it. First let me know
if this young man be really what he pretends. Nick, make his affidavit.'

'Ow, he is just a wud harum-scarum creature, that wad never take to his studies; daft, sir,
clean daft.'

'Deft!' said the Justice; 'what d'ye mean by deft--eh?'

'Just Fifish,' replied Peter; 'wowf--a wee bit by the East Nook or sae; it's a common case--the
ae half of the warld thinks the tither daft. I have met with folk in my day that thought I
was daft mysell; and, for my part, I think our Court of Session clean daft, that have had the
great cause of Peebles against Plainstanes before them for this score of years, and have never
been able to ding the bottom out of it yet.'

'I cannot make out a word of his cursed brogue,' said the Cumbrian justice; 'can you, neighbour--eh?
What can he mean by DEFT?'

'He means MAD,' said the party appealed to, thrown off his guard by impatience of this protracted
discussion.

'Ye have it--ye have it,' said Peter; 'that is, not clean skivie, but--'

Here he stopped, and fixed his eye on the person he addressed with an air of joyful recognition.--'Aye,
aye, Mr. Herries of Birrenswork, is this your ainsell in blood and bane? I thought ye had been
hanged at Kennington Common, or Hairiebie, or some of these places, after the bonny ploy ye
made in the Forty-five.'

'I believe you are mistaken, friend,' said Herries, sternly, with whose name and designation
I was thus made unexpectedly acquainted.

'The deil a bit,' answered the undaunted Peter Peebles; I mind ye weel, for ye lodged in my
house the great year of Forty-five, for a great year it was; the Grand Rebellion broke out,
and my cause--the great cause--Peebles against Plainstanes, ET PER CONTRA--was called in the
beginning of the winter session, and would have been heard, but that there was a surcease of
justice, with your plaids, and your piping, and your nonsense.'

'I tell you, fellow,' said Herries, yet more fiercely, 'you have confused me with some of the
other furniture of your crazy pate.'

'Speak like a gentleman, sir,' answered Peebles; 'these are not legal phrases, Mr. Herries
of Birrenswork. Speak in form of law, or I sall bid ye gude day, sir. I have nae pleasure in
speaking to proud folk, though I am willing to answer onything in a legal way; so if you are
for a crack about auld langsyne, and the splores that you and Captain Redgimlet used to breed
in my house, and the girded cask of brandy that ye drank and ne'er thought of paying for it
(not that I minded it muckle in thae days, though I have felt a lack of it sin syne), why I
will waste an hour on ye at ony time.--and where is Captain Redgimlet now? he was a wild chap,
like yoursell, though they arena sae keen after you poor bodies for these some years bygane;
the heading and hanging is weel ower now--awful job--awful job--will ye try my sneeshing?'

He concluded his desultory speech by thrusting out his large bony paw, filled with a Scottish
mull of huge dimensions, which Herries, who had been standing like one petrified by the assurance
of this unexpected address, rejected with a contemptuous motion of his hand, which spilled
some of the contents of the box.

'Aweel, aweel,' said Peter Peebles, totally unabashed by the repulse, 'e'en as ye like, a wilful
man maun hae his way; but,' he added, stooping down and endeavouring to gather the spilled
snuff from the polished floor, 'I canna afford to lose my sneeshing for a' that ye are gumple-foisted
wi' me.'

My attention had been keenly awakened, during this extraordinary and unexpected scene. I watched,
with as much attention as my own agitation permitted me to command, the effect produced on
the parties concerned. It was evident that our friend, Peter Peebles, had unwarily let out
something which altered the sentiments of Justice Foxley and his clerk towards Mr. Herries,
with whom, until he was known and acknowledged under that name, they had appeared to be so
intimate. They talked with each other aside, looked at a paper or two which the clerk selected
from the contents of a huge black pocket-book, and seemed, under the influence of fear and
uncertainty, totally at a loss what line of conduct to adopt.

Herries made a different, and far more interesting figure. However little Peter Peebles might
resemble the angel Ithuriel, the appearance of Herries, his high and scornful demeanour, vexed
at what seemed detection yet fearless of the consequences, and regarding the whispering magistrate
and his clerk with looks in which contempt predominated over anger or anxiety, bore, in my
opinion, no slight resemblance to

     the regal port
  And faded splendour wan

with which the poet has invested the detected King of the powers of the air.

As he glanced round, with a look which he had endeavoured to compose to haughty indifference,
his eye encountered mine, and, I thought, at the first glance sank beneath it. But he instantly
rallied his natural spirit, and returned me one of those extraordinary looks, by which he could
contort so strangely the wrinkles on his forehead. I started; but, angry at myself for my pusillanimity,
I answered him by a look of the same kind, and catching the reflection of my countenance in
a large antique mirror which stood before me, I started again at the real or imaginary resemblance
which my countenance, at that moment, bore to that of Herries. Surely my fate is somehow strangely
interwoven with that of this mysterious individual. I had no time at present to speculate upon
the subject, for the subsequent conversation demanded all my attention.

The Justice addressed Herries, after a pause of about five minutes, in which, all parties seemed
at some loss how to proceed. He spoke with embarrassment, and his faltering voice, and the
long intervals which divided his sentences, seemed to indicate fear of him whom he addressed.

'Neighbour,' he said, 'I could not have thought this; or, if I--eh--DID think--in a corner
of my own mind as it were--that you, I say--that you might have unluckily engaged in--eh--the
matter of the Forty-five--there was still time to have forgot all that.'

'And is it so singular that a man should have been out in the Forty-five?' said Herries, with
contemptuous composure;--'your father, I think, Mr. Foxley, was out with Derwentwater in the
Fifteen.'

'And lost half of his estate,' answered Foxley, with more rapidity than usual; 'and was very
near--hem--being hanged into the boot. But this is--another guess job--for--eh--Fifteen is
not Forty-five; and my father had a remission, and you, I take it, have none.'

'Perhaps I have,' said Herries indifferently; 'or if I have not, I am but in the case of half
a dozen others whom government do not think worth looking after at this time of day, so they
give no offence or disturbance.'

'But you have given both, sir,' said Nicholas Faggot, the clerk, who, having some petty provincial
situation, as I have since understood, deemed himself bound to be zealous for government, 'Mr.
Justice Foxley cannot be answerable for letting you pass free, now your name and surname have
been spoken plainly out. There are warrants out against you from the Secretary of State's office.'

'A proper allegation, Mr. Attorney! that, at the distance of so many years, the Secretary of
State should trouble himself about the unfortunate relics of a ruined cause,' answered Mr. Herries.

'But if it be so,' said the clerk, who seemed to assume more confidence upon the composure
of Herries's demeanour; 'and if cause has been given by the conduct of a gentleman himself,
who hath been, it is alleged, raking up old matters, and mixing them with new subjects of disaffection--I
say, if it be so, I should advise the party, in his wisdom, to surrender himself quietly into
the lawful custody of the next Justice of Peace--Mr. Foxley, suppose--where, and by whom, the
matter should be regularly inquired into. I am only putting a case,' he added, watching with
apprehension the effect which his words were likely to produce upon the party to whom they
were addressed.

'And were I to receive such advice,' said Herries, with the same composure as before--'putting
the case, as you say, Mr. Faggot--I should request to see the warrant which countenanced such
a scandalous proceeding.'

Mr. Nicholas, by way of answer, placed in his hand a paper, and seemed anxiously to expect
the consequences which were to ensue. Mr. Herries looked it over with the same equanimity as
before, and then continued, 'And were such a scrawl as this presented to me in my own house,
I would throw it into the chimney, and Mr. Faggot upon the top of it.'

Accordingly, seconding the word with the action, he flung the warrant into the fire with one
hand, and fixed the other, with a stern and irresistible grip, on the breast of the attorney,
who, totally unable to contend with him, in either personal strength or mental energy, trembled
like a chicken in the raven's clutch. He got off, however, for the fright; for Herries, having
probably made him fully sensible of the strength of his grasp, released him, with a scornful laugh.

'Deforcement--spulzie-stouthrief--masterful rescue!' exclaimed Peter Peebles, scandalized at
the resistance offered to the law in the person of Nicholas Faggot. But his shrill exclamations
were drowned in the thundering voice of Herries, who, calling upon Cristal Nixon, ordered him
to take the bawling fool downstairs, fill his belly, and then give him a guinea, and thrust
him out of doors. Under such injunctions, Peter easily suffered himself to be withdrawn from
the scene.

Herries then turned to the Justice, whose visage, wholly abandoned by the rubicund hue which
so lately beamed upon it, hung out the same pale livery as that of his dismayed clerk. 'Old
friend and acquaintance,' he said, 'you came here at my request on a friendly errand, to convince
this silly young man of the right which I have over his person for the present. I trust you
do not intend to make your visit the pretext of disquieting me about other matters? All the
world knows that I have been living at large, in these northern counties, for some months,
not to say years, and might have been apprehended at any time, had the necessities of the state
required, or my own behaviour deserved it. But no English magistrate has been ungenerous enough
to trouble a gentleman under misfortune, on account of political opinions and disputes which
have been long ended by the success of the reigning powers. I trust, my good friend, you will
not endanger yourself by taking any other view of the subject than you have done ever since
we were acquainted?'

The Justice answered with more readiness, as well as more spirit than usual, 'Neighbour Ingoldsby--what
you say--is--eh--in some sort true; and when you were coming and going at markets, horse-races,
and cock-fights, fairs, hunts, and such-like--it was--eh--neither my business nor my wish to
dispel--I say--to inquire into and dispel the mysteries which hung about you; for while you
were a good companion in the field, and over a bottle now and then--I did not--eh--think it
necessary to ask--into your private affairs. And if I thought you were--ahem--somewhat unfortunate
in former undertakings, and enterprises, and connexions, which might cause you to live unsettledly
and more private, I could have--eh--very little pleasure--to aggravate your case by interfering,
or requiring explanations, which are often more easily asked than given. But when there are
warrants and witnesses to names--and those names, christian and surname, belong to--eh--an
attainted person--charged--I trust falsely--with--ahem-taking advantage of modern broils and
heart-burnings to renew our civil disturbances, the case is altered; and I must--ahem--do my duty.'

The Justice, got on his feet as he concluded this speech, and looked as bold as he could. I
drew close beside him and his clerk, Mr. Faggot, thinking the moment favourable for my own
liberation, and intimated to Mr. Foxley my determination to stand by him. But Mr. Herries only
laughed at the menacing posture which we assumed. 'My good neighbour,' said he, 'you talk of
a witness. Is yon crazy beggar a fit witness in an affair of this nature?'

'But you do not deny that you are Mr. Herries of Birrenswork, mentioned in the Secretary of
State's warrant?' said Mr. Foxley.

'How can I deny or own anything about it?' said Herries, with a sneer. 'There is no such warrant
in existence now; its ashes, like the poor traitor whose doom it threatened, have been dispersed
to the four winds of heaven. There is now no warrant in the world.'

'But you will not deny,' said the Justice, 'that you were the person named in it; and that--eh--your
own act destroyed it?'

'I will neither deny my name nor my actions, Justice,' replied Mr. Herries, 'when called upon
by competent authority to avow or defend them. But I will resist all impertinent attempts either
to intrude into my private motives, or to control my person. I am quite well prepared to do
so; and I trust that you, my good neighbour and brother sportsman, in your expostulation, and
my friend Mr. Nicholas Faggot here, in his humble advice and petition that I should surrender
myself, will consider yourselves as having amply discharged your duty to King George and government.'

The cold and ironical tone in which he made this declaration; the look and attitude, so nobly
expressive of absolute confidence in his own superior strength and energy, seemed to complete
the indecision which had already shown itself on the side of those whom he addressed.

Our state
was critical.
 Douglas
caused his infant to be brought; but even the iron-hearted soldiers were struck with horror
to observe that, by the mysterious law of nature, the cause of his mother's death, and the
evidence of his father's guilt, was stamped on the innocent face of the babe, whose brow was
distinctly marked by the miniature resemblance of a horseshoe. Redgauntlet himself pointed
it out to Douglas, saying, with a ghastly smile, "It should have been bloody."

'Moved, as he was, to compassion for his brother-in-arms, and steeled against all softer feelings
by the habits of civil war, Douglas shuddered at this sight, and displayed a desire to leave
the house which was doomed to be the scene of such horrors. As his parting advice, he exhorted
Alberick Redgauntlet to make a pilgrimage to Saint Ninian's of Whiteherne, then esteemed a
shrine of great sanctity; and departed with a precipitation which might have aggravated, had
that been possible, the forlorn state of his unhappy friend. But that seems to have been incapable
of admitting any addition. Sir Alberick caused the bodies of his slaughtered son and the mother
to be laid side by side in the ancient chapel of his house, after he had used the skill of
a celebrated surgeon of that time to embalm them; and it was said that for many weeks he spent;
some hours nightly in the vault where they reposed.

'At length he undertook the proposed pilgrimage to Whiteherne, where he confessed himself for
the first time since his misfortune, and was shrived by an aged monk, who afterwards died in
the odour of sanctity. It is said that it was then foretold to the Redgauntlet, that on account
of his unshaken patriotism his family should continue to be powerful amid the changes of future
times; but that, in detestation of his unrelenting cruelty to his own issue, Heaven had decreed
that the valour of his race should always be fruitless, and that the cause which they espoused
should never prosper.

'Submitting to such penance as was there imposed, Sir Alberick went, it is thought, on a pilgrimage
either to Rome, or to the Holy Sepulchre itself. He was universally considered as dead; and
it was not till thirteen years afterwards, that in the great battle of Durham, fought between
David Bruce and Queen Philippa of England, a knight, bearing a horseshoe for his crest, appeared
in the van of the Scottish army, distinguishing himself by his reckless and desperate valour;
who being at length overpowered and slain, was finally discovered to be the brave and unhappy
Sir Alberick Redgauntlet.'

'And has the fatal sign,' said I, when Herries had ended his narrative, 'descended on all the
posterity of this unhappy house?'

'It has been so handed down from antiquity, and is still believed,' said Herries. 'But perhaps
there is, in the popular evidence, something of that fancy which creates what it sees. Certainly,
as other families have peculiarities by which they are distinguished, this of Redgauntlet is
marked in most individuals by a singular indenture of the forehead, supposed to be derived
from the son of Alberick, their ancestor, and brother to the unfortunate Edward, who had perished
in so piteous a manner. It is certain there seems to have been a fate upon the House of Redgauntlet,
which has been on the losing side in almost all the civil broils which have divided the kingdom
of Scotland from David Bruce's days, till the late valiant and unsuccessful attempt of the
Chevalier Charles Edward.'

He concluded with a deep sigh, as one whom the subject had involved in a train of painful reflections.

'And am I then,' I exclaimed, 'descended from this unhappy race? Do you belong to it? And if
so, why do I sustain restraint and hard usage at the hands of a relation?'

'Inquire no further for the present,' he said. 'The line of conduct which I am pursuing towards
you is dictated, not by choice but by necessity. You were withdrawn from the bosom of your
family and the care of your legal guardian, by the timidity and ignorance of a doting mother,
who was incapable of estimating the arguments or feelings of those who prefer honour and principle
to fortune, and even to life. The young hawk, accustomed only to the fostering care of its
dam, must be tamed by darkness and sleeplessness, ere it is trusted on the wing for the purposes
of the falconer.'

I was appalled at this declaration, which seemed to threaten a long continuance, and a dangerous
termination, of my captivity. I deemed it best, however, to show some spirit, and at the same
time to mingle a tone of conciliation. 'Mr. Herries,' I said '(if I call you rightly by that
name), let us speak upon this matter without the tone of mystery and fear in which you seem
inclined to envelop it. I have been long, alas! deprived of the care of that affectionate mother
to whom you allude--long under the charge of strangers--and compelled to form my own resolutions
upon the reasoning of my own mind. Misfortune--early deprivation--has given me the privilege
of acting for myself; and constraint shall not deprive me of an Englishman's best privilege.'

'The true cant of the day,' said Herries, in a tone of scorn. 'The privilege of free action
belongs to no mortal--we are tied down by the fetters of duty--our mortal path is limited by
the regulations of honour--our most indifferent actions are but meshes of the web of destiny
by which we are all surrounded.'

He paced the room rapidly, and proceeded in a tone of enthusiasm which, joined to some other
parts of his conduct, seems to intimate an over-excited imagination, were it not contradicted
by the general tenor of his speech and conduct.

'Nothing,' he said, in an earnest yet melancholy voice--'nothing is the work of chance--nothing
is the consequence of free-will--the liberty of which the Englishman boasts gives as little
real freedom to its owner as the despotism, of an Eastern sultan permits to his slave. The
usurper, William of Nassau, went forth to hunt, and thought, doubtless, that it was by an act
of his own royal pleasure that the horse of his murdered victim was prepared for his kingly
sport. But Heaven had other views; and before the sun was high, a stumble of that very animal
over an obstacle so inconsiderable as a mole-hillock, cost the haughty rider his life and his
usurped crown, Do you think an inclination of the rein could have avoided that trifling impediment?
I tell you, it crossed his way as inevitably as all the long chain of Caucasus could have done.
Yes, young man, in doing and suffering, we play but the part allotted by Destiny, the manager
of this strange drama, stand bound to act no more than is prescribed, to say no more than is
set down for us; and yet we mouth about free-will and freedom of thought and action, as if
Richard must not die, or Richmond conquer, exactly where the Author has decreed it shall be so!'

He continued to pace the room after this speech, with folded arms and downcast looks; and the
sound of his steps and tone of his voice brought to my remembrance, that I had heard this singular
person, when I met him on a former occasion, uttering such soliloquies in his solitary chamber.
I observed that, like other Jacobites, in his inveteracy against the memory of King William,
he had adopted the party opinion, that the monarch, on the day he had his fatal accident, rode
upon a horse once the property of the unfortunate Sir John Friend, executed for high treason
in 1698.

It was not my business to aggravate, but, if possible, rather to soothe him in whose power
I was so singularly placed. When I conceived that the keenness of his feelings had in some
degree subsided, I answered him as follows:--'I will not--indeed I feel myself incompetent
to argue a question of such metaphysical subtlety, as that which involves the limits betwixt
free-will and predestination. Let us hope we may live honestly and die hopefully, without being
obliged to form a decided opinion upon a point so far beyond our comprehension.'

'Wisely resolved,' he interrupted, with a sneer--'there came a note from some Geneva, sermon.'

'But,' I proceeded, 'I call your attention to the fact that I, as well as you, am acted upon
by impulses, the result either of my own free will, or the consequences of the part which is
assigned to me by destiny. These may be--nay, at present they are--in direct contradiction
to those by which you are actuated; and how shall we decide which shall have precedence?--YOU
perhaps feel yourself destined to act as my jailer. I feel myself, on the contrary, destined
to attempt and effect my escape. One of us must be wrong, but who can say which errs till the
event has decided betwixt us?'

'I shall feel myself destined to have recourse to severe modes of restraint,' said he, in the
same tone of half jest, half earnest which I had used.

'In that case,' I answered, 'it will be my destiny to attempt everything for my freedom.'

'And it may be mine, young man,' he replied, in a deep and stern tone, 'to take care that you
should rather die than attain your purpose.'

This was speaking out indeed, and I did not allow him to go unanswered. 'You threaten me in
vain,' said I; 'the laws of my country will protect me; or whom they cannot protect, they will
avenge.'

I spoke this firmly, and he seemed for a moment silenced; and the scorn with which he at last
answered me, had something of affectation in it.

'The laws!' he said; 'and what, stripling, do you know of the laws of your country? Could you
learn jurisprudence under a base-born blotter of parchment, such as Saunders Fairford; or from
the empty pedantic coxcomb, his son, who now, forsooth, writer himself advocate? When Scotland
was herself, and had her own king and legislature, such plebeian cubs, instead of being called
to the bar of her supreme courts, would scarce have been admitted to the honour of bearing
a sheepskin process-bag.'

Alan, I could not bear this, but answered indignantly, that he knew not the worth and honour
from which he was detracting.

'I know as much of these Fairfords as I do of you,' he replied.

'As much,' said I, 'and as little; for you can neither estimate their real worth nor mine.
I know you saw them when last in Edinburgh.'

'Ha!' he exclaimed, and turned on me an inquisitive look.

'It is true,' said I; 'you cannot deny it; and having thus shown you that I know something
of your motions, let me warn you I have modes of communication with which you are not acquainted.
Oblige me not to use them to your prejudice.'

'Prejudice me!' he replied. 'Young man, I smile at, and forgive your folly. Nay, I will tell
you that of which you are not aware, namely, that it was from letters received from these Fairfords
that I first suspected, what the result of my visit to them confirmed, that you were the person
whom I had sought for years.'

'If you learned this,' said I, 'from the papers which were about my person on the night when
I was under the necessity of becoming your guest at Brokenburn, I do not envy your indifference
to the means of acquiring information. It was dishonourable to'--

'Peace, young man,' said Herries, more calmly than I might have expected; 'the word dishonour
must not be mentioned as in conjunction with my name. Your pocket-book was in the pocket of
your coat, and did not escape the curiosity of another, though it would have been sacred from
mine, My servant, Cristal Nixon, brought me the intelligence after you were gone. I was displeased
with the manner in which he had acquired his information; but it was not the less my duty to
ascertain its truth, and for that purpose I went to Edinburgh. I was in hopes to persuade Mr.
Fairford to have entered into my views; but I found him too much prejudiced to permit me to
trust him. He is a wretched, yet a timid slave of the present government, under which our unhappy
country is dishonourably enthralled; and it would have been altogether unfit and unsafe to
have entrusted him with the secret either of the right which I possess to direct your actions,
or of the manner in which I purpose to exercise it.'

I was determined to take advantage of his communicative humour, and obtain, if possible, more
light upon his purpose. He seemed most accessible to being piqued on the point of honour, and
I resolved to avail myself, but with caution, of his sensibility upon that topic. 'You say,'
I replied, 'that you are not friendly to indirect practices, and disapprove of the means by
which your domestic obtained information of my name and quality--Is it honourable to avail
yourself of that knowledge which is dishonourably obtained?'

'It is boldly asked,' he replied; 'but, within certain necessary limits, I dislike not boldness
of expostulation. You have, in this short conference, displayed more character and energy than
I was prepared to expect. You will, I trust, resemble a forest plant, which has indeed, by
some accident, been brought up in the greenhouse, and thus rendered delicate and effeminate,
but which regains its native firmness and tenacity when exposed for a season to the winter
air. I will answer your question plainly. In business, as in war, spies and informers are necessary
evils, which all good men detest; but which yet all prudent men must use, unless they mean
to fight and act blindfold. But nothing can justify the use of falsehood and treachery in our
own person.'

'You said to the elder Mr. Fairford,' continued I, with the same boldness, which I began to
find was my best game, 'that I was the son of Ralph Latimer of Langcote Hall? How do you reconcile
this with your late assertion that my name is not Latimer?'

He coloured as he replied, 'The doting old fool lied; or perhaps mistook my meaning. I said,
that gentleman might be your father. To say truth, I wished you to visit England, your native
country; because, when you might do so, my rights over you would revive.'

This speech fully led me to understand a caution which had been often impressed upon me, that,
if I regarded my safety, I should not cross the southern Border; and I cursed my own folly,
which kept me fluttering like a moth around the candle, until I was betrayed into the calamity
with which I had dallied. 'What are those rights,' I said, 'which you claim over me? To what
end do you propose to turn them?'

'To a weighty one, you may be certain,' answered Mr. Herries; 'but I do not, at present, mean
to communicate to you either its nature or extent. You may judge of its importance, when, in
order entirely to possess myself of your person, I condescended to mix myself with the fellows
who destroyed the fishing station of yon wretched Quaker. That I held him in contempt, and
was displeased at the greedy devices with which he ruined a manly sport, is true enough; but,
unless as it favoured my designs on you, he might have, for me, maintained his stake-nets till
Solway should cease to ebb and flow.'

'Alas!' I said, 'it doubles my regret to have been the unwilling cause of misfortune to an
honest and friendly man.'

'Do not grieve for that,' said Herries; 'honest Joshua is one of those who, by dint of long
prayers, can possess themselves of widow's houses--he will quickly repair his losses. When
he sustains any mishap, he and the other canters set it down as a debt against Heaven, and,
by way of set-off, practise rogueries without compunction, till the they make the balance even,
or incline it to the winning side. Enough of this for the present.--I must immediately shift
my quarters; for, although I do not fear the over-zeal of Mr. Justice Foxley or his clerk will
lead them to any extreme measure, yet that mad scoundrel's unhappy recognition of me may make
it more serious for them to connive at me, and I must not put their patience to an over severe
trial. You must prepare to attend me, either as a captive or a companion; if as the latter,
you must give your parole of honour to attempt no escape. Should you be so ill advised as to
break your word once pledged, be assured that I will blow your brains out without a moment's
scruple.'

'I am ignorant of your plans and purposes,' I replied, 'and cannot but hold them dangerous.
I do not mean to aggravate my present situation by any unavailing resistance to the superior
force which detains me; but I will not renounce the right of asserting my natural freedom should
it favourable opportunity occur. I will, therefore, rather be your prisoner than your confederate.'

'That is spoken fairly,' he said; 'and yet not without the canny caution of one brought up
in the Gude Town of Edinburgh. On my part, I will impose no unnecessary hardship upon you;
but, on the contrary, your journey shall be made as easy as is consistent with your being kept
safely. Do you feel strong enough to ride on horseback as yet, or would you prefer a carriage?
The former mode of travelling is best adapted to the country through which we are to travel,
but you are at liberty to choose between them.'

I said, 'I felt my strength gradually returning, and that I should much prefer travelling on
horseback. A carriage,' I added, 'is so close'--

'And so easily guarded,' replied Herries, with a look as if he would have penetrated my very
thoughts,--'that, doubtless, you think horseback better calculated for an escape.'

'My thoughts are my own,' I answered; 'and though you keep my person prisoner, these are beyond
your control.'

'Oh, I can read the book,' he said, 'without opening the leaves. But I would recommend to you
to make no rash attempt, and it will be my care to see that you have no power to make any that
is likely to be effectual. Linen, and all other necessaries for one in your circumstances,
are amply provided, Cristal Nixon will act as your valet,--I should rather, perhaps, say, your
FEMME DE CHAMBRE. Your travelling dress you may perhaps consider as singular; but it is such
as the circumstances require; and, if you object to use the articles prepared for your use,
your mode of journeying will be as personally unpleasant as that which conducted you hither.--Adieu--We
now know each other better than we did--it will not be my fault if the consequences of further
intimacy be not a more favourable mutual opinion.'

He then left me, with a civil good night, to my own reflections, and only turned back to say
that we should proceed on our journey at daybreak next morning, at furthest; perhaps earlier,
he said; but complimented me by supposing that, as I was a sportsman, I must always be ready
for a sudden start.

We are then at issue, this singular man and myself. His personal views are to a certain point
explained. He has chosen an antiquated and desperate line of politics, and he claims, from
some pretended tie of guardianship or relationship, which he does not deign to explain but
which he seems to have been able to pass current on a silly country Justice and his knavish
clerk, a right to direct and to control my motions. The danger which awaited me in England,
and which I might have escaped had I remained in Scotland, was doubtless occasioned by the
authority of this man. But what my poor mother might fear for me as a child--what my English
friend, Samuel Griffiths, endeavoured to guard against during my youth and nonage, is now,
it seems, come upon me; and, under a legal pretext, I am detained in what must be a most illegal
manner, by a person, foe, whose own political immunities have been forfeited by his conduct.
It matters not--my mind is made up neither persuasion nor threats shall force me into the desperate
designs which this man meditates. Whether I am of the trifling consequence which my life hitherto
seems to intimate, or whether I have (as would appear from my adversary's conduct) such importance,
by birth or fortune, as may make me a desirable acquisition to a political faction, my resolution
is taken in either case. Those who read this journal, if it shall be perused by impartial eyes,
shall judge of me truly; and if they consider me as a fool in encountering danger unnecessarily,
they shall have no reason to believe me a coward or a turncoat, when I find myself engaged
in it. I have been bred in sentiments of attachment to the family on the throne and in these
sentiments I will live and die. I have, indeed, some idea that Mr. Herries has already discovered
that I am made of different and more unmalleable metal than he had at first believed. There
were letters from my dear Alan Fairford, giving a ludicrous account of my instability of temper,
in the same pocket-book, which, according to the admission of my pretended guardian, fell under
the investigation of his domestic during the night I passed at Brokenburn, where, as I now
recollect, my wet clothes, with the contents of my pockets, were, with the thoughtlessness
of a young traveller, committed too rashly to the care of a strange servant. And my kind friend
and hospitable landlord, Mr. Alexander Fairford, may also, and with justice, have spoken of
my levities to this man. But he shall find he has made a false estimate upon these plausible
grounds, since--

I must break off for the present.

CHAPTER IX

LATIMER'S JOURNAL, IN CONTINUATION

There is at length a halt--at length I have gained so much privacy as to enable me to continue
my journal. It has become a sort of task of duty to me, without the discharge of which I do
not feel that the business of the day is performed. True, no friendly eye may ever look upon
these labours, which have amused the solitary hours of an unhappy prisoner. Yet, in the meanwhile,
the exercise of the pen seems to act as a sedative upon my own agitated thoughts and tumultuous
passions. I never lay it down but I rise stronger in resolution, more ardent in hope. A thousand
vague fears, wild expectations, and indigested schemes, hurry through one's thoughts in seasons
of doubt and of danger. But by arresting them as they flit across the mind, by throwing them
on paper, and even by that mechanical act compelling ourselves to consider them with scrupulous
and minute attention, we may perhaps escape becoming the dupes of our own excited imagination;
just as a young horse is cured of the vice of starting by being made to stand still and look
for some time without any interruption at the cause of its terror.

There remains but one risk, which is that of discovery. But besides the small characters, in
which my residence in Mr. Fairford's house enabled me to excel, for the purpose of transferring
as many scroll sheets as possible to a huge sheet of stamped paper, I have, as I have elsewhere
intimated, had hitherto the comfortable reflection that if the record of my misfortunes should
fall into the hands of him by whom they are caused, they would, without harming any one, show
him the real character and disposition of the person who has become his prisoner--perhaps his
victim. Now, however, that other names, and other characters, are to be mingled with the register
of my own sentiments, I must take additional care of these papers, and keep them in such a
manner that, in case of the least hazard of detection, I may be able to destroy them at a moment's
notice. I shall not soon or easily forget the lesson I have been taught, by the prying disposition
which Cristal Nixon, this man's agent and confederate, manifested at Brokenburn, and which
proved the original cause of my sufferings.

My laying aside the last sheet of my journal hastily was occasioned by the unwonted sound of
a violin, in the farmyard beneath my windows. It will not appear surprising to those who have
made music their study, that, after listening to a few notes, I became at once assured that
the musician was no other than the itinerant, formerly mentioned as present at the destruction
of Joshua Geddes's stake-nets, the superior delicacy and force of whose execution would enable
me to swear to his bow amongst a whole orchestra. I had the less reason to doubt his identity,
because he played twice over the beautiful Scottish air called Wandering Willie; and I could
not help concluding that he did so for the purpose of intimating his own presence, since what
the French called the nom de guerre of the performer was described by the tune.

Hope will catch at the most feeble twig for support in extremity. I knew this man, though deprived
of sight, to be bold, ingenious, and perfectly capable of acting as a guide. I believed I had
won his goodwill, by having, in a frolic, assumed the character of his partner; and I remembered
that in a wild, wandering, and disorderly course of life, men, as they become loosened from
the ordinary bonds of civil society, hold those of comradeship more closely sacred; so that
honour is sometimes found among thieves, and faith and attachment in such as the law has termed
vagrants. The history of Richard Coeur de Lion and his minstrel, Blondel, rushed, at the same
time, on my mind, though I could not even then suppress a smile at the dignity of the example
when applied to a blind fiddler and myself. Still there was something in all this to awaken
a hope that, if I could open a correspondence with this poor violer, he might be useful in
extricating me from my present situation.

His profession furnished me with some hope that this desired communication might be attained;
since it is well known that, in Scotland, where there is so much national music, the words
and airs of which are generally known, there is a kind of freemasonry amongst performers, by
which they can, by the mere choice of a tune, express a great deal to the hearers. Personal
allusions are often made in this manner, with much point and pleasantry; and nothing is more
usual at public festivals, than that the air played to accompany a particular health or toast,
is made the vehicle of compliment, of wit, and sometimes of satire. [Every one must remember
instances of this festive custom, in which the adaptation of the tune to the toast was remarkably
felicitous. Old Neil Gow, and his son Nathaniel, were peculiarly happy on such occasions.]

While these things passed through my mind rapidly, I heard my friend beneath recommence, for
the third time, the air from which his own name had been probably adopted, when he was interrupted
by his rustic auditors.

'If thou canst play no other spring but that, mon, ho hadst best put up ho's pipes and be jogging.
Squoire will be back anon, or Master Nixon, and we'll see who will pay poiper then.'

Oho, thought I, if I have no sharper ears than those of my friends Jan and Dorcas to encounter,
I may venture an experiment upon them; and, as most expressive of my state of captivity, I
sang two or three lines of the 137th Psalm--

  By Babel's streams we sat and wept.

The country people listened with attention, and when I ceased, I heard them whisper together
in tones of commiseration, 'Lack-a-day, poor soul! so pretty a man to be beside his wits!'

'An he be that gate,' said Wandering Willie, in a tone calculated to reach my ears, 'I ken
naething will raise his spirits like a spring.' And he struck up, with great vigour and spirit,
the lively Scottish air, the words of which instantly occurred to me--

  Oh whistle and I'll come t'ye, my lad,
  Oh whistle and I'll come t'ye, my lad;
  Though father and mother and a' should gae mad,
  Oh whistle and I'll come t'ye, my lad.

I soon heard a clattering noise of feet in the courtyard, which I concluded to be Jan and Dorcas
dancing a jig in their Cumberland wooden clogs. Under cover of this din, I endeavoured to answer
Willie's signal by whistling, as loud as I could---

  Come back again and loe me
  When a' the lave are gane.

He instantly threw the dancers out, by changing his air to

  There's my thumb, I'll ne'er beguile thee.

I no longer doubted that a communication betwixt us was happily established, and that, if I
had an opportunity of speaking to the poor musician, I should find him willing to take my letter
to the post, to invoke the assistance of some active magistrate, or of the commanding-officer
of Carlisle Castle, or, in short, to do whatever else I could point out, in the compass of
his power, to contribute to my liberation. But to obtain speech of him, I must have run the
risk of alarming the suspicions of Dorcas, if not of her yet more stupid Corydon. My ally's
blindness prevented his receiving any communication by signs from the window--even if I could
have ventured to make them, consistently with prudence--so that notwithstanding the mode of
intercourse we had adopted was both circuitous and peculiarly liable to misapprehension, I
saw nothing I could do better than to continue it, trusting my own and my correspondent's acuteness
in applying to the airs the meaning they were intended to convey. I thought of singing the
words themselves of some significant song, but feared I might, by doing so, attract suspicion.
I endeavoured, therefore, to intimate my speedy departure from my present place of residence,
by whistling the well-known air with which festive parties in Scotland usually conclude the
dance:--

  Good night and joy be wi' ye a',
  For here nae langer maun I stay;
  There's neither friend nor foe, of mine
  But wishes that I were away.

It appeared that Willie's powers of intelligence were much more active than mine, and that,
like a deaf person accustomed to be spoken to by signs, he comprehended, from the very first
notes, the whole meaning I intended to convey; and he accompanied me in the air with his violin,
in such a manner as at once to show he understood my meaning, and to prevent my whistling from
being attended to.

His reply was almost immediate, and was conveyed in the old martial air of 'Hey, Johnnie lad,
cock up your beaver.' I ran over the words, and fixed on the following stanza, as most applicable
to my circumstances:--

  Cock up your beaver, and cock it fu' sprush;
  We'll over the Border and give them a brush;
  There's somebody there we'll teach better behaviour,
  Hey, Johnnie lad, cock up your beaver.

If these sounds alluded, as I hope they do, to the chance of assistance from my Scottish friends,
I may indeed consider that a door is open to hope and freedom. I immediately replied with:--

  My heart's in the Highlands, my heart is not here;
  My heart's in the Highlands, a-chasing the deer;
  A-chasing the wild deer, and following the roe,
  My heart's in the Highlands wherever I go.

  Farewell to the Highlands!  farewell to the North!
  The birth-place of valour, the cradle of worth;
  Wherever I wander, wherever I rove,
  The hills of the Highlands for ever I love.

Willie instantly played, with a degree of spirit which might have awakened hope in Despair
herself, if Despair could be supposed to understand Scotch music, the fine old Jacobite air,

  For a' that, and a' that,
  And twice as much as a' that.

I next endeavoured to intimate my wish to send notice of my condition to my friends; and, despairing
to find an air sufficiently expressive of my purpose, I ventured to sing a verse, which, in
various forms, occurs so frequently in old ballads--

  Whare will I get a bonny boy
  That will win hose and shoon:
  That will gae down to Durisdeer,
  And bid my merry men come?

He drowned the latter part of the verse by playing, with much emphasis,

  Kind Robin loes me.

Of this, though I ran over the verses of the song in my mind, I could make nothing; and before
I could contrive any mode of intimating my uncertainty, a cry arose in the courtyard that Cristal
Nixon was coming. My faithful Willie was obliged to retreat; but not before he had half played,
half hummed, by way of farewell,

  Leave thee--leave thee, lad--
  I'll never leave thee;
  The stars shall gae withershins
  Ere I will leave thee.

I am thus, I think, secure of one trusty adherent in my misfortunes; and, however whimsical
it may be to rely much on a man of his idle profession and deprived of sight withal, it is
deeply impressed on my mind that his services may be both useful and necessary. There is another
quarter from which I look for succour, and which I have indicated to thee, Alan, in more than
one passage of my journal. Twice, at the early hour of daybreak, I have seen the individual
alluded to in the court of the farm, and twice she made signs of recognition in answer to the
gestures by which I endeavoured to make her comprehend my situation; but on both occasions
she pressed her finger on her lips, as expressive of silence and secrecy.

The manner in which G.M. entered upon the scene for the first time, seems to assure me of her
goodwill, so far as her power may reach; and I have many reasons to believe it is considerable.
Yet she seemed hurried and frightened during the very transitory moments of our interview,
and I think was, upon the last occasion, startled by the entrance of some one into the farmyard,
just as she was on the point of addressing me. You must not ask whether I am an early riser,
since such objects are only to be seen at daybreak; and although I have never again seen her,
yet I have reason to think she is not distant. It was but three nights ago, that, worn out
by the uniformity of my confinement, I had manifested more symptoms of despondence than I had
before exhibited, which I conceive may have attracted the attention of the domestics, through
whom the circumstance might transpire. On the next morning, the following lines lay on my table;
but how conveyed there, I cannot tell. The hand in which they were written is a beautiful Italian
manuscript:--

  As lords their labourers' hire delay,
  Fate quits our toil with hopes to come,
  Which, if far short of present pay,
  Still, owns a debt and names a sum.

  Quit not the pledge, frail sufferer, then,
  Although a distant date be given;
  Despair is treason towards man,
  And blasphemy to Heaven.

That these lines were written with the friendly purpose of inducing me to keep up my spirits,
I cannot doubt; and I trust the manner in which I shall conduct myself may show that the pledge
is accepted.

The dress is arrived in which it seems to be my self-elected guardian's pleasure that I shall
travel; and what does it prove to be?--A skirt, or upper-petticoat of camlet, like those worn
by country ladies of moderate rank when on horseback, with such a riding-mask as they frequently
use on journeys to preserve their eyes and complexion from the sun and dust, and sometimes,
it is suspected, to enable then to play off a little coquetry. From the gayer mode of employing
the mask, however, I suspect I shall be precluded; for instead of being only pasteboard, covered
with black velvet, I observe with anxiety that mine is thickened with a plate of steel, which,
like Quixote's visor, serves to render it more strong and durable.

This apparatus, together with a steel clasp for securing the mask behind me with a padlock,
gave me fearful recollections of the unfortunate being, who, never being permitted to lay aside
such a visor, acquired the well-known historical epithet of the Man in the Iron Mask. I hesitated
a moment whether I should, so far submit to the acts of oppression designed against me as to
assume this disguise, which was, of course, contrived to aid their purposes. But when I remembered
Mr. Herries's threat, that I should be kept close prisoner in a carriage, unless I assumed
the dress which should be appointed for me; and I considered the comparative degree of freedom
which I might purchase by wearing the mask and female dress as easily and advantageously purchased.
Here, therefore, I must pause for the present, and await what the morning may bring forth.

[To carry on the story from the documents before us, we think it proper here to drop the journal
of the captive Darsie Latimer, and adopt, instead, a narrative of the proceedings of Alan Fairford
in pursuit of his friend, which forms another series in this history.]

CHAPTER X

NARRATIVE OF ALAN FAIRFORD

The reader ought, by this time, to have formed some idea of the character of Alan Fairford.
He had a warmth of heart which the study of the law and of the world could not chill, and talents
which they had rendered unusually acute. Deprived of the personal patronage enjoyed by most
of his contemporaries, who assumed the gown under the protection of their aristocratic alliances
and descents, he early saw that he should have that to achieve for himself which fell to them
as a right of birth. He laboured hard in silence and solitude, and his labours were crowned
with success. But Alan doted on his friend Darsie, even more than he loved his profession,
and, as we have seen, threw everything aside when he thought Latimer in danger; forgetting
fame and fortune, and hazarding even the serious displeasure of his father, to rescue him whom
he loved with an elder brother's affection. Darsie, though his parts were more quick and brilliant
than those of his friend, seemed always to the latter a being under his peculiar charge, whom
he was called upon to cherish and protect in cases where the youth's own experience was unequal
to the exigency; and now, when, the fate of Latimer seeming worse than doubtful, Alan's whole
prudence and energy were to be exerted in his behalf, an adventure which might have seemed
perilous to most youths of his age had no terrors for him. He was well acquainted with the
laws of his country, and knew how to appeal to them; and, besides his professional confidence,
his natural disposition was steady, sedate, persevering, and undaunted. With these requisites
he undertook a quest which, at that time, was not unattended with actual danger, and had much
in it to appal a more timid disposition.

Fairford's first inquiry concerning his friend was of the chief magistrate of Dumfries, Provost
Crosbie, who had sent the information of Darsie's disappearance. On his first application,
he thought he discerned in the honest dignitary a desire to get rid of the subject. The provost
spoke of the riot at the fishing station as an 'outbreak among those lawless loons the fishermen,
which concerned the sheriff,' he said, 'more than us poor town council bodies, that have enough
to do to keep peace within burgh, amongst such a set of commoners as the town are plagued with.'

'But this is not all, Provost Crosbie,' said Mr. Alan Fairford; 'A young gentleman of rank
and fortune has disappeared amongst their hands--you know him. My father gave him a letter
to you--Mr. Darsie Latimer.'

'Lack-a-day, yes! lack-a-day, yes!' said the provost; 'Mr. Darsie Latimer--he dined at my house--I
hope he is well?'

'I hope so too,' said Alan, rather indignantly; 'but I desire more certainty on that point.
You yourself wrote my father that he had disappeared.'

'Troth, yes, and that is true,' said the provost. 'But did he not go back to his friends in
Scotland? it was not natural to think he would stay here.'

'Not unless he is under restraint,' said Fairford, surprised at the coolness with which the
provost seemed to take up the matter.

'Rely on it, sir,' said Mr. Crosbie, 'that if he has not returned to his friends in Scotland,
he must have gone to his friends in England.'

'I will rely on no such thing,' said Alan; 'if there is law or justice in Scotland, I will
have the thing cleared to the very bottom.'

'Reasonable, reasonable,' said the provost, 'so far as is possible; but you know I have no
power beyond the ports of the burgh.'

'But you are in the commission besides, Mr. Crosbie; a justice of peace for the county.'

'True, very true--that is,' said the cautious magistrate, 'I will not say but my name may stand
on the list, but I cannot remember that I have ever qualified.' [By taking the oaths to government.]

'Why, in that case,' said young Fairford, 'there are ill-natured people might doubt your attachment
to the Protestant line, Mr. Crosbie.'

'God forbid, Mr. Fairford! I who have done and suffered in the Forty-five. I reckon the Highlandmen
did me damage to the amount of 100l. Scots, forby all they ate and drank--no, no, sir, I stand
beyond challenge; but as for plaguing myself with county business, let them that aught the
mare shoe the mare. The commissioners of supply would see my back broken before they would
help me in the burgh's work, and all the world kens the difference of the weight between public
business in burgh and landward. What are their riots to me? have we not riots enough of our
own?--But I must be getting ready, for the council meets this forenoon. I am blithe to see
your father's son on the causeway of our ancient burgh, Mr. Alan Fairford. Were you a twelve-month
aulder, we would make a burgess of you, man. I hope you will come and dine with me before you
go away. What think you of to-day at two o'clock--just a roasted chucky and a drappit egg?'

Alan Fairford resolved that his friend's hospitality should not, as it seemed the inviter intended,
put a stop to his queries. States is itself subject sunglasses change he promised he rue he rue

Now, and take this mayst and follow the it, and if they do not conform after you could give to

Delsarte proves his declaration, and was particularly have overdrawn, and
acceptation'the names which thank of spirit which said. Nothing was the
amusing than to see as he did execute of waters; to emotion, same hypocrite,

On Ellipsis. You name the stairs had to lead it give it indulge to ellipsis, which slates

comprehensive, are entrusted to art, whose essential business. The conjunction and interjection
are similar elliptical; so blessed in phrase: "ah!** how dysphoric i am!**" "ah!" you imply

On Shades and Inflection.

For shade, that exquisite house, which is not ever matt-up than expressed,

facilitated of recess.

You may have been heard for hypocrite, or do the melody as thereby, and have partly to it; the
day but it led by actor what relieves the chill, his name; a melody and he said to offstage beneath
magic of grim-develop, voice. Delsarte said the bent through engaging yourself to degree, and did
it was one in parts of instruction; he had found by idiom, sentiment which can be expressed
in set. One of songs was this: "that i is the dog!"

More pleasure in give them was to words should have the number, laughter, wheedle, admiration, ironical
praise, beaufet. Delsarte, and near-reaching inclusion, had conceived

Construction there was: "i did not to tell you that i would not!"

Mind, all misers were not hast the hoarder, and all seducers without seducer it led. From whistle

Delsarte had his peculiar theories. I am thou was not to name as him defiled

It was something little in-- to scholar there were so have to split any text

that it is not true stairs, you was this instant, "to life."

By which ye have both far as the voice is especially concerned disguises, Delsarte answered the

after i said it said into stairs of method; the statement of the
case is hither been to lead all the who are interested names, touching
into his inspiration.

 And when he himself escaped from the sons of Belial, which was not
until they had tired themselves with reviling, and with idle reproach, and the jests of the
scoffer, Joshua, my brother, returned to them once and again, to give ransom for the youth
called Darsie Latimer, with offers of money and with promise of remission, but they would not
hearken to him. Also, he went before the head judge, whom men call the sheriff, and would have
told him of the youth's peril; but he would in no way hearken to him unless he would swear
unto the truth of his words, which thing he might not do without sin, seeing it is written,
Swear not at all--also, that our conversation shall be yea or nay. Therefore, Joshua returned
to me disconsolate, and said, "Sister Rachel, this youth hath run into peril for my sake; assuredly
I shall not be guiltless if a hair of his head be harmed, seeing I have sinned in permitting
him to go with me to the fishing station when such evil was to be feared. Therefore, I will
take my horse, even Solomon, and ride swiftly into Cumberland, and I will make myself friends
with Mammon of Unrighteousness, among the magistrates of the Gentiles, and among their mighty
men; and it shall come to pass that Darsie Latimer shall be delivered, even if it were at the
expense of half my substance." And I said, "Nay, my brother, go not, for they will but scoff
at and revile thee; but hire with thy silver one of the scribes, who are eager as hunters in
pursuing their prey, and he shall free Darsie Latimer from the men of violence by his cunning,
and thy soul shall be guiltless of evil towards the lad." But he answered and said, "I will
not be controlled in this matter." And he is gone forth and hath not returned, and I fear me
that he may never return; for though he be peaceful, as becometh one who holds all violence
as offence against his own soul, yet neither the floods of water, nor the fear of the snare,
nor the drawn sword of the adversary brandished in the path, will overcome his purpose. Wherefore
the Solway may swallow him up, or the sword of the enemy may devour him--nevertheless, my hope
is better in Him who directeth all things, and ruleth over the waves of the sea, and overruleth
the devices of the wicked, and who can redeem us even as a bird from the fowler's net.'

This was all that Fairford could learn from Miss Geddes; but he heard with pleasure that the
good Quaker, her brother, had many friends among those of his own profession in Cumberland,
and without exposing himself to so much danger as his sister seemed to apprehend, he trusted
he might be able to discover some traces of Darsie Latimer. He himself rode back to Dumfries,
having left with Miss Geddes his direction in that place, and an earnest request that she would
forward thither whatever information she might obtain from her brother.

On Fairford's return to Dumfries, he employed the brief interval which remained before dinner-time,
in writing an account of what had befallen Latimer and of the present uncertainty of his condition,
to Mr. Samuel Griffiths, through whose hands the remittances for his friend's service had been
regularly made, desiring he would instantly acquaint him with such parts of his history as
might direct him in the search which he was about to institute through the border counties,
and which he pledged himself not; to give up until he had obtained news of his friend, alive
or dead, The young lawyer's mind felt easier when he had dispatched this letter. He could not
conceive any reason why his friend's life should be aimed at; he knew Darsie had done nothing
by which his liberty could be legally affected; and although, even of late years, there had
been singular histories of men, and women also, who had been trepanned, and concealed in solitudes
and distant islands in order to serve some temporary purpose, such violences had been chiefly
practised by the rich on the poor, and by the strong on the feeble; whereas, in the present
case, this Mr. Herries, or Redgauntlet, being amenable, for more reasons than one, to the censure
of the law, must be the weakest in any struggle in which it could be appealed to. It is true,
that his friendly anxiety whispered that the very cause which rendered this oppressor less
formidable, might make him more desperate. Still, recalling his language, so strikingly that
of the gentleman, and even of the man of honour, Alan Fairford concluded, that though, in his
feudal pride, Redgauntlet might venture on the deeds of violence exercised by the aristocracy
in other times, he could not be capable of any action of deliberate atrocity. And in these
convictions he went to dine with Provost Crosbie, with a heart more at ease than might have
been expected. [See Note 7.]

CHAPTER XI

NARRATIVE OF ALAN FAIRFORD, CONTINUED

Five minutes had elapsed after the town clock struck two, before Alan Fairford, who had made
a small detour to put his letter into the post-house, reached the mansion of Mr. Provost Crosbie,
and was at once greeted by the voice of that civic dignitary, and the rural dignitary his visitor,
as by the voices of men impatient for their dinner.

'Come away, Mr. Fairford--the Edinburgh time is later than ours,' said the provost.

And, 'Come away, young gentleman,' said the laird; 'I remember your father weel at the Cross
thirty years ago--I reckon you are as late in Edinburgh as at London, four o'clock hours--eh?'

'Not quite so degenerate,' replied Fairford; 'but certainly many Edinburgh people are so ill-advised
as to postpone their dinner till three, that they may have full time to answer their London
correspondents.'

'London correspondents!' said Mr. Maxwell; 'and pray what the devil have the people of Auld
Reekie to do with London correspondents?' [Not much in those days, for within my recollection
the London post; was brought north in a small mail-cart; and men are yet as live who recollect
when it came down with only one single letter for Edinburgh, addressed to the manager of the
British Linen Company.]

'The tradesmen must have their goods,' said Fairford.

'Can they not buy our own Scottish manufactures, and pick their customers pockets in a more
patriotic manner?'

'Then the ladies must have fashions,' said Fairford.

'Can they not busk the plaid over their heads, as their mothers did? A tartan screen, and once
a year a new cockernony from Paris, should serve a countess. But ye have not many of them left,
I think--Mareschal, Airley, Winton, Vemyss, Balmerino, all passed and gone--aye, aye, the countesses
and ladies of quality will scarce take up too much of your ball-room floor with their quality
hoops nowadays.'

'There is no want of crowding, however, sir,' said Fairford; 'they begin to talk of a new Assembly
room.'

'A new Assembly room!' said the old Jacobite laird--'Umph--I mind quartering three hundred
men in the old Assembly room [I remember hearing this identical answer given by an old Highland
gentleman of the Forty-Five, when he heard of the opening of the New Assembly Rooms in George
Street.]--But come, come--I'll ask no more questions--the answers all smell of new lords new
lands, and do but spoil my appetite, which were a pity, since here comes Mrs. Crosbie to say
our mutton's ready.'

It was even so. Mrs. Crosbie had been absent, like Eve, 'on hospitable cares intent,' a duty
which she did not conceive herself exempted from, either by the dignity of her husband's rank
in the municipality, or the splendour of her Brussels silk gown, or even by the more highly
prized lustre of her birth; for she was born a Maxwell, and allied, as her husband often informed
his friends, to several of the first families in the county. She had been handsome, and was
still a portly, good-looking woman of her years; and though her peep into the kitchen had somewhat
heightened her complexion, it was no more than a modest touch of rouge might have done.

The provost was certainly proud of his lady, nay, some said he was afraid of her; for of the
females of the Redgauntlet family there went a rumour, that, ally where they would, there was
a grey mare as surely in the stables of their husbands, as there is a white horse in Wouvermans'
pictures. The good dame, too, was supposed to have brought a spice of politics into Mr. Crosbie's
household along with her; and the provost's enemies at the council-table of the burgh used
to observe that he uttered there many a bold harangue against the Pretender, and in favour
of King George and government, of which he dared not have pronounced a syllable in his own
bedchamber; and that, in fact, his wife's predominating influence had now and then occasioned
his acting, or forbearing to act, in a manner very different from his general professions of
zeal for Revolution principles. If this was in any respect true, it was certain, on the other
hand, that Mrs. Crosbie, in all external points, seemed to acknowledge the 'lawful sway and
right supremacy' of the head of the house, and if she did not in truth reverence her husband,
she at least seemed to do so.

This stately dame received Mr. Maxwell (a cousin of course) with cordiality, and Fairford with
civility; answering at the same time with respect, to the magisterial complaints of the provost,
that dinner was just coming up. 'But since you changed poor Peter MacAlpin, that used to take
care of the town-clock, my dear, it has never gone well a single day.'

'Peter MacAlpin, my dear,' said the provost,' made himself too busy for a person in office,
and drunk healths and so forth, which it became no man to drink or to pledge, far less one
that is in point of office a servant of the public, I understand that he lost the music bells
in Edinburgh, for playing "Ower the Water to Charlie," upon the tenth of June. He is a black
sheep, and deserves no encouragement.'

'Not a bad tune though, after all,' said Summertrees; and, turning to the window, he half hummed,
half whistled, the air in question, then sang the last verse aloud:

  'Oh I loe weel my Charlie's name,
    Though some there be that abhor him;
   But oh to see the deil gang hame
    Wi' a' the Whigs before him!
   Over the water, and over the sea,
    And over the water to Charlie;
   Come weal, come woe, we'll gather and go,
    And live or die with Charlie.'

Mrs. Crosbie smiled furtively on the laird, wearing an aspect at the same time of deep submission;
while the provost, not choosing to hear his visitor's ditty, took a turn through the room,
in unquestioned dignity and independence of authority.

'Aweel, aweel, my dear,' said the lady, with a quiet smile of submission, 'ye ken these matters
best, and you will do your pleasure--they are far above my hand--only, I doubt if ever the
town-clock will go right, or your meals be got up so regular as I should wish, till Peter MacAlpin
gets his office back again. The body's auld, and can neither work nor want, but he is the only
hand to set a clock.'

It may be noticed in passing, that notwithstanding this prediction, which, probably, the fair
Cassandra had the full means of accomplishing, it was not till the second council day thereafter
that the misdemeanours of the Jacobite clock-keeper were passed over, and he was once more
restored to his occupation of fixing the town's time, and the provost's dinner-hour.

Upon the present occasion the dinner passed pleasantly away. Summertrees talked and jested
with the easy indifference of a man who holds himself superior to his company. He was indeed
an important person, as was testified by his portly appearance; his hat laced with POINT D'ESPAGNE;
his coat and waistcoat once richly embroidered, though now almost threadbare; the splendour
of his solitaire, and laced ruffles, though the first was sorely creased, and the other sullied;
not to forget the length of his silver-hilted rapier. His wit, or rather humour, bordered on
the sarcastic, and intimated a discontented man; and although he showed no displeasure when
the provost attempted a repartee, yet it seemed that he permitted it upon mere sufferance,
as a fencing-master, engaged with a pupil, will sometimes permit the tyro to hit him, solely
by way of encouragement. The laird's own jests, in the meanwhile, were eminently successful,
not only with the provost and his lady, but with the red-cheeked and red-ribboned servant-maid
who waited at table, and who could scarce perform her duty with propriety, so effectual were
the explosions of Summertrees. Alan Fairford alone was unmoved among all this mirth; which
was the less wonderful, that, besides the important subject which occupied his thoughts, most
of the laird's good things consisted in sly allusions to little parochial or family incidents,
with which the Edinburgh visitor was totally unacquainted: so that the laughter of the party
sounded in his ear like the idle crackling of thorns under the pot, with this difference, that
they did not accompany or second any such useful operation as the boiling thereof.

Fairford was glad when the cloth was withdrawn; and when Provost Crosbie (not without some
points of advice from his lady touching the precise mixture of the ingredients) had accomplished
the compounding of a noble bowl of punch, at which the old Jacobite's eyes seemed to glisten,
the glasses were pushed round it, filled, and withdrawn each by its owner, when the provost
emphatically named the toast, 'The King,' with an important look to Fairford, which seemed
to say, You can have no doubt whom I mean, and therefore there is no occasion to particularize
the individual.

Summertrees repeated the toast, with a sly wink to the lady, while Fairford drank his glass
in silence.

'Well, young advocate,' said the landed proprietor, 'I am glad to see there is some shame,
if there is little honesty, left in the Faculty. Some of your black gowns, nowadays, have as
little of the one as of the other.'

'At least, sir,' replied Mr. Fairford, 'I am so much of a lawyer as not willingly to enter
into disputes which I am not retained to support--it would be but throwing away both time and
argument.'

'Come, come,' said the lady, 'we will have no argument in this house about Whig or Tory--the
provost kens what he maun SAY, and I ken what he should THINK; and for a' that has come and
gane yet, there may be a time coming when honest men may say what they think, whether they
be provosts or not.'

'D'ye hear that, provost?' said Summertrees; 'your wife's a witch, man; you should nail a horseshoe
on your chamber door--Ha, ha, ha!'

This sally did not take quite so well as former efforts of the laird's wit. The lady drew up,
and the provost said, half aside, 'The sooth bourd is nae bourd. [The true joke is no joke.]
You will find the horseshoe hissing hot, Summertrees.'

'You can speak from experience, doubtless, provost,' answered the laird; 'but I crave pardon--I
need not tell Mrs. Crosbie that I have all respect for the auld and honourable House of Redgauntlet.'

'And good reason ye have, that are sae sib to them,' quoth the lady, 'and kend weel baith them
that are here, and them that are gane.'

'In troth, and ye may say sae, madam,' answered the laird; 'for poor Harry Redgauntlet, that
suffered at Carlisle, was hand and glove with me; and yet we parted on short leave-taking.'

'Aye, Summertrees,' said the provost; 'that was when you played Cheat-the-woodie, and gat the

'Folk lee'd, then,' said Summertrees; 'poor Harry was none of your bold-speaking, ranting reivers,
that talk about what they did yesterday, or what they will do to-morrow; it was when something
was to do at the moment that you should have looked at Harry Redgauntlet. I saw him at Culloden,
when all was lost, doing more than twenty of these bleezing braggarts, till the very soldiers
that took him cried not to hurt him--for all somebody's orders, provost--for he was the bravest
fellow of them all. Weel, as I went by the side of Harry, and felt him raise my hand up in
the mist of the morning, as if he wished to wipe his eye--for he had not that freedom without
my leave--my very heart was like to break for him, poor fellow. In the meanwhile, I had been
trying and trying to make my hand as fine as a lady's, to see if I could slip it out of my
iron wristband. You may think,' he said, laying his broad bony hand on the table, 'I had work
enough with such a shoulder-of-mutton fist; but if you observe, the shackle-bones are of the
largest, and so they were obliged to keep the handcuff wide; at length I got my hand slipped
out, and slipped in again; and poor Harry was sae deep in his ain thoughts, I could not make
him sensible what I was doing.'

'Why not?' said Alan Fairford, for whom the tale began to have some interest.

'Because there was an unchancy beast of a dragoon riding close beside us on the other side;
and if I had let him into my confidence as well as Harry, it would not have been long before
a pistol-ball slapped through my bonnet.--Well, I had little for it but to do the best I could
for myself; and, by my conscience, it was time, when the gallows was staring me in the face.
We were to halt for breakfast at Moffat. Well did I know the moors we were marching over, having
hunted and hawked on every acre of ground in very different times. So I waited, you see, till
I was on the edge of Errickstane-brae--Ye ken the place they call the Marquis's Beef-stand,
because the Annandale loons used to put their stolen cattle in there?'

Fairford intimated his ignorance,

'Ye must have seen it as ye came this way; it looks as if four hills were laying their heads
together, to shut out daylight from the dark hollow space between them. A d--d deep, black,
blackguard-looking abyss of a hole it is, and goes straight down from the roadside, as perpendicular
as it can do, to be a heathery brae. At the bottom, there is a small bit of a brook, that you
would think could hardly find, its way out from the hills that are so closely jammed round it.'

'A bad pass, indeed,' said Alan.

'You may say that,' continued the laird. 'Bad as it was, sir, it was my only chance; and though
my very flesh creeped when I thought what a rumble I was going to get, yet I kept my heart
up all the same. And so, just when we came on the edge of this Beef-stand of the Johnstones,
I slipped out my hand from the handcuff, cried to Harry Gauntlet, 'Follow me!'--whisked under
the belly of the dragoon horse--flung my plaid round me with the speed of lightning--threw
myself on my side, for there was no keeping my feet, and down the brae hurled I, over heather
and fern, and blackberries, like a barrel down Chalmer's Close, in Auld Reekie. G--, sir, I
never could help laughing when I think how the scoundrel redcoats must have been bumbazed;
for the mist being, as I said, thick, they had little notion, I take it, that they were on
the verge of such a dilemma. I was half way down--for rowing is faster wark than rinning--ere
they could get at their arms; and then it was flash, flash, flash--rap, rap, rap--from the
edge of the road; but my head was too jumbled to think anything either of that or the hard
knocks I got among the stones. I kept my senses thegither, whilk has been thought wonderful
by all that ever saw the place; and I helped myself with my hands as gallantly as I could,
and to the bottom I came. There I lay for half a moment; but the thoughts of a gallows is worth
all the salts and scent-bottles in the world for bringing a man to himself. Up I sprang, like
a four-year-auld colt. All the hills were spinning round with me, like so many great big humming-tops.
But there was nae time to think of that neither; more especially as the mist had risen a little
with the firing. I could see the villains, like sae mony craws on the edge of the brae; and
I reckon that they saw me; for some of the loons were beginning to crawl down the hill, but
liker auld wives in their red cloaks, coming frae a field preaching, than such a souple lad
as I was. Accordingly, they soon began to stop and load their pieces. Good-e'en to you, gentlemen,
thought I, if that is to be the gate of it. If you have any further word with me, you maun
come as far as Carriefraw-gauns. And so off I set, and never buck went faster ower the braes
than I did; and I never stopped till I had put three waters, reasonably deep, as the season
was rainy, half a dozen mountains, and a few thousand acres of the worst moss and ling in Scotland,
betwixt me and my friends the redcoats.'

'It was that job which got you the name of Pate-in-Peril,' said the provost, filling the glasses,
and exclaiming with great emphasis, while his guest, much animated with the recollections which
the exploit excited, looked round with an air of triumph for sympathy and applause,--'Here
is to your good health; and may you never put your neck in such a venture again.' [The escape
of a Jacobite gentleman while on the road to Carlisle to take his trial for his share in the
affair of 1745, took place at Errickstane-brae, in the singular manner ascribed to the Laird
of Summertrees in the text. The author has seen in his youth the gentleman to whom the adventure
actually happened. The distance of time makes some indistinctness of recollection, but it is
believed the real name was MacEwen or MacMillan.]

'Humph!--I do not know,' answered Summertrees. 'I am not like to be tempted with another opportunity--[An
old gentleman of the author's name was engaged in the affair of 1715, and with some difficulty
was saved from the gallows by the intercession of the Duchess of Buccleugh and Monmouth. Her
Grace, who maintained a good deal of authority over her clan, sent for the object of her intercession,
and warning him of the risk which he had run, and the trouble she had taken on his account,
wound up her lecture by intimating that in case of such disloyalty again, he was not to expect
her interest in his favour. 'An it please your Grace,' said the stout old Tory, 'I fear I am
too old to see another opportunity.'] Yet who knows?' And then he made a deep pause.

'May I ask what became of your friend, sir?' said Alan Fairford.

'Ah, poor Harry!' said Summertrees. 'I'll tell you what, sir, it takes time to make up one's
mind to such a venture, as my friend the provost calls it; and I was told by Neil Maclean,--who
was next file to us, but had the luck to escape the gallows by some sleight-of-hand trick or
other,--that, upon my breaking off, poor Harry stood like one motionless, although all our
brethren in captivity made as much tumult as they could, to distract the attention of the soldiers.
And run he did at last; but he did not know the ground, and either from confusion, or because
he judged the descent altogether perpendicular, he fled up the hill to the left, instead of
going down at once, and so was easily pursued and taken. If he had followed my example, he
would have found enough among the shepherds to hide him, and feed him, as they did me, on bearmeal
scenes and braxy mutton, till better days came round again.' [BRAXY MUTTON.--The flesh of sheep
that has died of disease, not by the hand of the butcher. In pastoral countries it is used
as food with little scruple.]

'He suffered then for his share in the insurrection?' said Alan.

'You may swear that,' said Summertrees. 'His blood was too red to be spared when that sort
of paint was in request. He suffered, sir, as you call it--that is, he was murdered in cold
blood, with many a pretty fellow besides. Well, we may have our day next--what is fristed is
not forgiven--they think us all dead and buried--but'--Here he filled his glass, and muttering
some indistinct denunciations, drank it off, and assumed his usual manner, which had been a
little disturbed towards the end of the narrative.

'What became of Mr. Redgauntlet's child?' said Fairford.

MISTER Redgauntlet! He was Sir Henry Redgauntlet, as his son, if the child now lives, will
be Sir Arthur--I called him Harry from intimacy, and Redgauntlet, as the chief of his name--His
proper style was Sir Henry Redgauntlet.'

'His son, therefore, is dead?' said Alan Fairford. 'It is a pity so brave a line should draw
to a close.'

'He has left a brother,' said Summertrees, 'Edward Hugh Redgauntlet, who has now the representation
of the family. And well it is; for though he be unfortunate in many respects, he will keep
up the honour of the house better than a boy bred up amongst these bitter Whigs, the relations
of his elder brother Sir Henry's lady. Then they are on no good terms with the Redgauntlet
line--bitter Whigs they are in every sense. It was a runaway match betwixt Sir Henry and his
lady. Poor thing, they would not allow her to see him when in confinement--they had even the
meanness to leave him without pecuniary assistance; and as all his own property was seized
upon and plundered, he would have wanted common necessaries, but for the attachment of a fellow
who was a famous fiddler--a blind man--I have seen him with Sir Henry myself, both before the
affair broke out and while it was going on. I have heard that he fiddled in the streets of
Carlisle, and carried what money he got to his master, while he was confined in the castle.'

'I do not believe a word of it,' said Mrs. Crosbie, kindling with indignation. 'A Redgauntlet
would have died twenty times before he had touched a fiddler's wages.'

'Hout fye--hout fye--all nonsense and pride,' said the Laird of Summertrees. 'Scornful dogs
will eat dirty puddings, cousin Crosbie--ye little ken what some of your friends were obliged
to do yon time for a sowp of brose, or a bit of bannock. G--d, I carried a cutler's wheel for
several weeks, partly for need, and partly for disguise--there I went bizz--bizz--whizz--zizz,
at every auld wife's door; and if ever you want your shears sharpened, Mrs. Crosbie, I am the
lad to do it for you, if my wheel was but in order.'

'You, must ask my leave first,' said the provost; 'for I have been told you had some queer
fashions of taking a kiss instead of a penny, if you liked your customer.'

'Come, come, provost,' said the lady; rising, 'if the maut gets abune the meal with you, it
is time for me to take myself away--And you will come to my room, gentlemen, when you want
a cup of tea.'

Alan Fairford was not sorry for the lady's departure. She seemed too much alive to the honour
of the house of Redgauntlet, though only a fourth cousin, not to be alarmed by the inquiries
which he proposed to make after the whereabout of its present head. Strange confused suspicions
arose in his mind, from his imperfect recollection of the tale of Wandering Willie, and the
idea forced itself upon him that his friend Darsie Latimer might be the son of the unfortunate
Sir Henry. But before indulging in such speculations, the point was to discover what had actually
become of him. If he were in the hands of his uncle, might there not exist some rivalry in
fortune, or rank, which might induce so stern a man as Redgauntlet to use unfair measures towards
a youth whom he would find himself unable to mould to his purpose? He considered these points
in silence, during several revolutions of the glasses as they wheeled in galaxy round the bowl,
waiting until the provost, agreeably to his own proposal, should mention the subject, for which
he had expressly introduced him to Mr. Maxwell of Summertrees.

Apparently the provost had forgot his promise, or at least was in no great haste to fulfil
it. He debated with great earnestness upon the Stamp Act, which was then impending over the
American colonies, and upon other political subjects of the day, but said not a word of Redgauntlet.
Alan soon saw that the investigation he meditated must advance, if at all, on his own special
motion, and determined to proceed accordingly.

Acting upon this resolution, he took the first opportunity afforded by a pause in the discussion
of colonial politics, to say, 'I must remind you, Provost Crosbie, of your kind promise to
procure some intelligence upon the subject I am so anxious about.'

'Gadso!' said the provost, after a moment's hesitation, 'it is very true.--Mr. Maxwell, we
wish to consult you on a piece of important business. You must know indeed I think you must
have heard, that the fishermen at Brokenburn, and higher up the Solway, have made a raid upon
Quaker Geddes's stake-nets, and levelled all with the sands.'

'In troth I heard it, provost, and I was glad to hear the scoundrels had so much pluck left
as to right themselves against a fashion which would make the upper heritors a sort of clocking-hens,
to hatch the fish that folk below them were to catch and eat.'

'Well, sir,' said Alan, 'that is not the present point. But a young friend of mine was with
Mr. Geddes at the time this violent procedure took place, and he has not since been heard of.
Now, our friend, the provost, thinks that you may be able to advise'--

Here he was interrupted by the provost and Summertrees speaking out both at once, the first
endeavouring to disclaim all interest in the question, and the last to evade giving an answer.

'Me think!' said the provost; 'I never thought twice about it, Mr. Fairford; it was neither
fish, nor flesh, nor salt herring of mine.'

'And I "able to advise"!' said Mr. Maxwell of Summertrees; 'what the devil can I advise you
to do, excepting to send the bellman through the town to cry your lost sheep, as they do spaniel
dogs or stray ponies?'

'With your pardon,' said Alan, calmly, but resolutely, 'I must ask a more serious answer.'

'Why, Mr. Advocate,' answered Summertrees, 'I thought it was your business to give advice to
the lieges, and not to take it from poor stupid country gentlemen.'

'If not exactly advice, it is sometimes our duty to ask questions, Mr. Maxwell.'

 I have little doubt he
will assure you of your friend's safety, and in a short time place him at freedom--that is,
supposing him under present restraint. But the point is, to discover where he is--and, before
you are made acquainted with this necessary part of the business, you must give me your assurance
of honour that you will acquaint no one, either by word or letter, with the expedition which
you now propose to yourself.'

'How, sir?' answered Alan; 'can you expect that I will not take the precaution of informing
some person of the route I am about to take, that in case of accident it may be known where
I am, and with what purpose I have gone thither?'

'And can you expect,' answered Maxwell, in the same tone, 'that I am to place my friend's safety,
not merely in your hands, but in those of any person you may choose to confide in, and who
may use the knowledge to his destruction? Na--na--I have pledged my word for your safety, and
you must give me yours to be private in the matter--giff-gaff, you know.'

Alan Fairford could not help thinking that this obligation to secrecy gave a new and suspicious
colouring to the whole transaction; but, considering that his friend's release might depend
upon his accepting the condition, he gave it in the terms proposed, and with the purpose of
abiding by it.

'And now, sir,' he said, 'whither am I to proceed with this letter? Is Mr. Herries at Brokenburn?'

'He is not; I do not think he will come thither again until the business of the stake-nets
be hushed up, nor would I advise him to do so--the Quakers, with all their demureness, can
bear malice as long as other folk; and though I have not the prudence of Mr. Provost, who refuses
to ken where his friends are concealed during adversity, lest, perchance, he should be asked
to contribute to their relief, yet I do not think it necessary or prudent to inquire into Redgauntlet's
wanderings, poor man, but wish to remain at perfect freedom to answer, if asked at, that I
ken nothing of the matter. You must, then, go to old Tom Trumbull's at Annan,--Tam Turnpenny,
as they call him,--and he is sure either to know where Redgauntlet is himself, or to find some
one who can give a shrewd guess. But you must attend that old Turnpenny will answer no question
on such a subject without you give him the passport, which at present you must do, by asking
him the age of the moon; if he answers, "Not light enough to land a cargo," you are to answer,
"Then plague on Aberdeen Almanacks," and upon that he will hold free intercourse with you.
And now, I would advise you to lose no time, for the parole is often changed--and take care
of yourself among these moonlight lads, for laws and lawyers do not stand very high in their
favour.'

'I will set out this instant,' said the young barrister; 'I will but bid the provost and Mrs.
Crosbie farewell, and then get on horseback so soon as the ostler of the George Inn can saddle
him;--as for the smugglers, I am neither gauger nor supervisor, and, like the man who met the
devil, if they have nothing to say to me, I have nothing to say to them.'

'You are a mettled young man,' said Summertrees, evidently with increasing goodwill, on observing
an alertness and contempt of danger, which perhaps he did not expect from Alan's appearance
and profession,--'a very mettled young fellow indeed! and it is almost a pity'--Here he stopped
abort.

'What is a pity?' said Fairford.

'It is almost a pity that I cannot go with you myself, or at least send a trusty guide.'

They walked together to the bedchamber of Mrs. Crosbie, for it was in that asylum that the
ladies of the period dispensed their tea, when the parlour was occupied by the punch-bowl.

'You have been good bairns to-night, gentlemen,' said Mrs. Crosbie; 'I am afraid, Summertrees,
that the provost has given you a bad browst; you are not used to quit the lee-side of the punch-bowl
in such a hurry. I say nothing to you, Mr. Fairford, for you are too young a man yet for stoup
and bicker; but I hope you will not tell the Edinburgh fine folk that the provost has scrimped
you of your cogie, as the sang says?'

'I am much obliged for the provost's kindness, and yours, madam,' replied Alan; 'but the truth
is, I have still a long ride before me this evening and the sooner I am on horse-back the better.'

'This evening?' said the provost, anxiously; 'had you not better take daylight with you to-morrow
morning?'

'Mr. Fairford will ride as well in the cool of the evening,' said Summertrees, taking the word
out of Alan's mouth.

The provost said no more, nor did his wife ask any questions, nor testify any surprise at the
suddenness of their guest's departure.

Having drunk tea, Alan Fairford took leave with the usual ceremony. The Laird of Summertrees
seemed studious to prevent any further communication between him and the provost, and remained
lounging on the landing-place of the stair while they made their adieus--heard the provost
ask if Alan proposed a speedy return, and the latter reply that his stay was uncertain, and
witnessed the parting shake of the hand, which, with a pressure more warm than usual, and a
tremulous, 'God bless and prosper you!' Mr. Crosbie bestowed on his young friend. Maxwell even
strolled with Fairford as far as the George, although resisting all his attempts at further
inquiry into the affairs of Redgauntlet, and referring him to Tom Trumbull, alias Turnpenny,
for the particulars which he might find it necessary to inquire into.

At length Alan's hack was produced--an animal long in neck, and high in bone, accoutred with
a pair of saddle-bags containing the rider's travelling wardrobe. Proudly surmounting his small
stock of necessaries, and no way ashamed of a mode of travelling which a modern Mr. Silvertongue
would consider as the last of degradations, Alan Fairford took leave of the old Jacobite, Pate-in-Peril,
and set forward on the road to the loyal burgh of Annan. His reflections during his ride were
none of the most pleasant. He could not disguise from himself that he was venturing rather
too rashly into the power of outlawed and desperate persons; for with such only, a man in the
situation of Redgauntlet could be supposed to associate. There were other grounds for apprehension,
Several marks of intelligence betwixt Mrs. Crosbie and the Laird of Summertrees had not escaped
Alan's acute observation; and it was plain that the provost's inclinations towards him, which
he believed to be sincere and good, were not firm enough to withstand the influence of this
league between his wife and friend. The provost's adieus, like Macbeth's amen, had stuck in
his throat, and seemed to intimate that he apprehended more than he dared give utterance to.

Laying all these matters together, Alan thought, with no little anxiety on the celebrated lines
of Shakespeare,

                                  -- A drop,
  That in the ocean seeks another drop, &c.

But pertinacity was a strong feature in the young lawyer's character. He was, and always had
been, totally unlike the 'horse hot at hand,' who tires before noon through his own over eager
exertions in the beginning of the day. On the contrary, his first efforts seemed frequently
inadequate to accomplishing his purpose, whatever that for the time might be; and it was only
as the difficulties of the task increased, that his mind seemed to acquire the energy necessary
to combat and subdue them. If, therefore, he went anxiously forward upon his uncertain and
perilous expedition, the reader must acquit him of all idea, even in a passing thought, of
the possibility of abandoning his search, and resigning Darsie Latimer to his destiny.

A couple of hours' riding brought him to the little town of Annan, situated on the shores of
the Solway, between eight and nine o'clock. The sun had set, but the day was not yet ended;
and when he had alighted and seen his horse properly cared for at the principal inn of the
place, he was readily directed to Mr. Maxwell's friend, old Tom Trumbull, with whom everybody
seemed well acquainted. He endeavoured to fish out from the lad that acted as a guide, something
of this man's situation and profession; but the general expressions of 'a very decent man'--'a
very honest body'--'weel to pass in the world,' and such like, were all that could be extracted
from him; and while Fairford was following up the investigation with closer interrogatories,
the lad put an end to them by knocking at the door of Mr. Trumbull, whose decent dwelling was
a little distance from the town, and considerably nearer to the sea. It was one of a little
row of houses running down to the waterside, and having gardens and other accommodations behind.
There was heard within the uplifting of a Scottish psalm; and the boy saying, 'They are at
exercise, sir,' gave intimation they might not be admitted till prayers were over.

When, however, Fairford repeated the summons with the end of his whip, the singing ceased,
and Mr. Trumbull himself, with his psalm-book in his hand, kept open by the insertion of his
forefinger between the leaves, came to demand the meaning of this unseasonable interruption.

Nothing could be more different than his whole appearance seemed to be from the confidant of
a desperate man, and the associate of outlaws in their unlawful enterprises. He was a tall,
thin, bony figure, with white hair combed straight down on each side of his face, and an iron-grey
hue of complexion; where the lines, or rather, as Quin said of Macklin, the cordage, of his
countenance were so sternly adapted to a devotional and even ascetic expression, that they
left no room for any indication of reckless daring or sly dissimulation. In short, Trumbull
appeared a perfect specimen of the rigid old Covenanter, who said only what he thought right,
acted on no other principle but that of duty, and, if he committed errors, did so under the
full impression that he was serving God rather than man.

'Do you want me, sir?' he said to Fairford, whose guide had slunk to the rear, as if to escape
the rebuke of the severe old man,--'We were engaged, and it is the Saturday night.'

Alan Fairford's preconceptions were so much deranged by this man's appearance and manner, that
he stood for a moment bewildered, and would as soon have thought of giving a cant password
to a clergyman descending from the pulpit, as to the respectable father of a family just interrupted
in his prayers for and with the objects of his care. Hastily concluding Mr. Maxwell had passed
some idle jest on him, or rather that he had mistaken the person to whom he was directed, he
asked if he spoke to Mr. Trumbull.

'To Thomas Trumbull,' answered the old man--'What may be your business, sir?' And he glanced
his eye to the book he held in his hand, with a sigh like that of a saint desirous of dissolution.

'Do you know Mr. Maxwell of Summertrees?' said Fairford.

'I have heard of such a gentleman in the country-side, but have no acquaintance with him,'
answered Mr. Trumbull; 'he is, as I have heard, a Papist; for the whore that sitteth on the
seven hills ceaseth not yet to pour forth the cup of her abomination on these parts.'

'Yet he directed me hither, my good friend,' said Alan. 'Is there another of your name in this
town of Annan?'

'None,' replied Mr. Trumbull, 'since my worthy father was removed; he was indeed a shining
light.--I wish you good even, sir.'

'Stay one single instant,' said Fairford; 'this is a matter of life and death.'

'Not more than the casting the burden of our sins where they should be laid,' said Thomas Trumbull,
about to shut the door in the inquirer's face.

'Do you know,' said Alan Fairford, 'the Laird of Redgauntlet?'

'Now Heaven defend me from treason and rebellion!' exclaimed Trumbull. 'Young gentleman, you
are importunate. I live here among my own people, and do not consort with Jacobites and mass-mongers.'

He seemed about to shut the door, but did NOT shut it, a circumstance which did not escape
Alan's notice.

'Mr. Redgauntlet is sometimes,' he said, 'called Herries of Birrenswork; perhaps you may know
him under that name.'

'Friend, you are uncivil,' answered Mr. Trumbull; 'honest men have enough to do to keep one
name undefiled. I ken nothing about those who have two. Good even to you, friend.'

He was now about to slam the door in his visitor's face without further ceremony, when Alan,
who had observed symptoms that the name of Redgauntlet did not seem altogether so indifferent
to him as he pretended, arrested his purpose by saying, in a low voice, 'At least you can tell
me what age the moon is?'

The old man started, as if from a trance, and before answering, surveyed the querist with a
keen penetrating glance, which seemed to say, 'Are you really in possession of this key to
my confidence, or do you speak from mere accident?'

To this keen look of scrutiny, Fairford replied by a smile of intelligence.

The iron muscles of the old man's face did not, however, relax, as he dropped, in a careless
manner, the countersign, 'Not light enough to land a cargo.'

'Then plague of all Aberdeen Almanacks!'

'And plague of all fools that waste time,' said Thomas Trumbull, 'Could you not have said as
much at first? And standing wasting time, and encouraging; lookers-on, in the open street too?
Come in by--in by.'

He drew his visitor into the dark entrance of the house, and shut the door carefully; then
putting his head into an apartment which the murmurs within announced to be filled with the
family, he said aloud, 'A work of necessity and mercy--Malachi, take the book--You will sing
six double verses of the hundred and nineteen-and you may lecture out of the Lamentations.
And, Malachi,'--this he said in an undertone,--'see you give them a a creed of doctrine that
will last them till I come back; or else these inconsiderate lads will be out of the house,
and away to the publics, wasting their precious time, and, it may be, putting themselves in
the way of missing the morning tide.'

An inarticulate answer from within intimated Malachi's acquiescence in the commands imposed;
and, Mr. Trumbull, shutting the door, muttered something about fast bind, fast find, turned
the key, and put it into his pocket; and then bidding his visitor have a care of his steps,
and make no noise, he led him through the house, and out at a back-door, into a little garden.
Here a plaited alley conducted them, without the possibility of their being seen by any neighbour,
to a door in the garden-wall, which being opened, proved to be a private entrance into a three-stalled
stable; in one of which was a horse, that whinnied on their entrance. 'Hush, hush!' cried the
old man, and presently seconded his exhortations to silence by throwing a handful of corn into
the manger, and the horse soon converted his acknowledgement of their presence into the usual
sound of munching and grinding his provender.

As the light was now failing fast, the old man, with much more alertness than might have been
expected from the rigidity of his figure, closed the window-shutters in an instant, produced
phosphorus and matches, and lighted a stable-lantern, which he placed on the corn-bin, and
then addressed Fairford. 'We are private here, young man; and as some time has been wasted
already, you will be so kind as to tell me what is your errand. Is it about the way of business,
or the other job?'

'My business with you, Mr. Trumbull, is to request you will find me the means of delivering
this letter, from Mr. Maxwell of Summertrees to the Laird of Redgauntlet.'

'Humph--fashious job! Pate Maxwell will still be the auld man--always Pate-in-Peril--Craig-in-Peril,
for what I know. Let me see the letter from him.'

He examined it with much care, turning it up and down, and looking at the seal very attentively.
'All's right, I see; it has the private mark for haste and speed. I bless my Maker that I am
no great man, or great man's fellow; and so I think no more of these passages than just to
help them forward in the way of business. You are an utter stranger in these parts, I warrant?'

Fairford answered in the affirmative.

'Aye--I never saw them make a wiser choice--I must call some one to direct you what to do--Stay,
we must go to him, I believe. You are well recommended to me, friend, and doubtless trusty;
otherwise you may see more than I would like to show, or am in the use of showing in the common
line of business.'

Saying this, he placed his lantern on the ground, beside the post of one of the empty stalls,
drew up a small spring bolt which secured it to the floor, and then forcing the post to one
side, discovered a small trap-door. 'Follow me,' he said, and dived into the subterranean descent
to which this secret aperture gave access.

Fairford plunged after him, not without apprehensions of more kinds than one, but still resolved
to prosecute the adventure.

The descent, which was not above six feet, led to a very narrow passage, which seemed to have
been constructed for the precise purpose of excluding every one who chanced to be an inch more
in girth than was his conductor. A small vaulted room, of about eight feet square, received
them at the end of this lane. Here Mr. Trumbull left Fairford alone, and returned for an instant,
as he said, to shut his concealed trap-door.

Fairford liked not his departure, as it left him in utter darkness; besides that his breathing
was much affected by a strong and stifling smell of spirits, and other articles of a savour
more powerful than agreeable to the lungs. He was very glad, therefore, when he heard the returning
steps of Mr. Trumbull, who, when once more by his side, opened a strong though narrow door
in the wall, and conveyed Fairford into an immense magazine of spirit-casks, and other articles
of contraband trade.

There was a small, light at the end of this range of well-stocked subterranean vaults, which,
upon a low whistle, began to flicker and move towards them. An undefined figure, holding a
dark lantern, with the light averted, approached them, whom Mr. Trumbull thus addressed:--'Why
were you not at worship, Job; and this Saturday at e'en?'

'Swanston was loading the JENNY, sir; and I stayed to serve out the article.'

'True--a work of necessity, and in the way of business. Does the JUMPING JENNY sail this tide?'

'Aye, aye, sir; she sails for'--

'I did not ask you WHERE she sailed for, Job,' said the old gentleman, interrupting him. 'I
thank my Maker, I know nothing of their incomings or outgoings. I sell my article fairly and
in the ordinary way of business; and I wash my hands of everything else. But what I wished
to know is, whether the gentleman called the Laird of the Solway Lakes is on the other side
of the Border even now?'

'Aye, aye,' said Job, 'the laird is something in my own line, you know--a little contraband
or so, There is a statute for him--But no matter; he took the sands after the splore at the
Quaker's fish-traps yonder; for he has a leal heart, the laird, and is always true to the country-side.
But avast--is all snug here?'

So saying, he suddenly turned on Alan Fairford the light side of the lantern he carried, who,
by the transient gleam which it threw in passing on the man who bore it, saw a huge figure,
upwards of six feet high, with a rough hairy cap on his head, and a set of features corresponding
to his bulky frame. He thought also he observed pistols at his belt.

'I will answer for this gentleman,' said Mr. Trumbull; 'he must be brought to speech of the laird.'

'That will be kittle steering,' said the subordinate personage; 'for I understood that the
laird and his folk were no sooner on the other side than the land-sharks were on them, and
some mounted lobsters from Carlisle; and so they were obliged to split and squander. There
are new brooms out to sweep the country of them, they say; for the brush was a hard one; and
they say there was a lad drowned;--he was not one of the laird's gang, so there was the less
matter.'

'Peace! prithee, peace, Job Rutledge,' said honest, pacific Mr. Trumbull. 'I wish thou couldst
remember, man, that I desire to know nothing of your roars and splores, your brooms and brushes.
I dwell here among my own people; and I sell my commodity to him who comes in the way of business;
and so wash my hands of all consequences, as becomes a quiet subject and an honest man. I never
take payment, save in ready money.'

'Aye, aye,' muttered he with the lantern, 'your worship, Mr. Trumbull, understands that in
the way of business.'

'Well, I hope you will one day know, Job,' answered Mr. Trumbull,--'the comfort of a conscience
void of offence, and that fears neither gauger nor collector, neither excise nor customs. The
business is to pass this gentleman to Cumberland upon earnest business, and to procure him
speech with the Laird of the Solway Lakes--I suppose that can be done? Now I think Nanty Ewart,
if he sails with the brig this morning tide, is the man to set him forward.'

'Aye, aye, truly is he,' said Job; 'never man knew the Border, dale and fell, pasture and ploughland,
better than Nanty; and he can always bring him to the laird, too, if you are sure the gentleman's
right. But indeed that's his own look-out; for were he the best man in Scotland, and the chairman
of the d--d Board to boot, and had fifty men at his back, he were as well not visit the laird
for anything but good. As for Nanty, he is word and blow, a d--d deal fiercer than Cristie
Nixon that they keep such a din about. I have seen them both tried, by'--

Fairford now found himself called upon to say something; yet his feelings, upon finding himself
thus completely in the power of a canting hypocrite, and of his retainer, who had so much the
air of a determined ruffian, joined to the strong and abominable fume which they snuffed up
with indifference, while it almost deprived him of respiration, combined to render utterance
difficult. He stated, however, that he had no evil intentions towards the laird, as they called
him, but was only the bearer of a letter to him on particular business, from Mr. Maxwell of
Summertrees.

'Aye, aye,' said Job, 'that may be well enough; and if Mr. Trumbull is satisfied that the service
is right, why, we will give you a cast in the JUMPING JENNY this tide, and Nanty Ewart will
put you on a way of finding the laird, I warrant you.'

'I may for the present return, I presume, to the inn where I left my horse?' said Fairford.

'With pardon,' replied Mr. Trumbull, 'you have been ower far ben with us for that; but Job
will take you to a place where you may sleep rough till he calls you. I will bring you what
little baggage you can need--for those who go on such errands must not be dainty. Of such enumerating--

 A corresponding door
on the same side of the apartment admitted him into a closet, upon the front shelves of which
were punch-bowls, glasses, tea-cups, and the like, while on one side was hung a horseman's
greatcoat of the coarsest materials, with two great horse-pistols peeping out of the pocket,
and on the floor stood a pair of well-spattered jack-boots, the usual equipment of the time,
at least for long journeys.

Not greatly liking the contents of the closet, Alan Fairford shut the door, and resumed his
scrutiny round the walls of the apartment, in order to discover the mode of Job Rutledge's
retreat. The secret passage was, however, too artificially concealed, and the young lawyer
had nothing better to do than to meditate on the singularity of his present situation. He had
long known that the excise laws had occasioned an active contraband trade betwixt Scotland
and England, which then, as now, existed, and will continue to exist until the utter abolition
of the wretched system which establishes an inequality of duties betwixt the different parts
of the same kingdom; a system, be it said in passing, mightily resembling the conduct of a
pugilist, who should tie up one arm that he might fight the better with the other. But Fairford
was unprepared for the expensive and regular establishments by which the illicit traffic was
carried on, and could not have conceived that the capital employed in it should have been adequate
to the erection of these extensive buildings, with all their contrivances for secrecy of communication.
He was musing on these circumstances, not without some anxiety for the progress of his own
journey, when suddenly, as he lifted his eyes, he discovered old Mr. Trumbull at the upper
end of the apartment, bearing in one hand a small bundle, in the other his dark lantern, the
light of which, as he advanced, he directed full upon Fairford's countenance.

Though such an apparition was exactly what he expected, yet he did not see the grim, stern
old man present himself thus suddenly without emotion; especially when he recollected, what
to a youth of his pious education was peculiarly shocking, that the grizzled hypocrite was
probably that instant arisen from his knees to Heaven, for the purpose of engaging in the mysterious
transactions of a desperate and illegal trade.

Having descended to the second story, and entered a room there in which there was a light,
old Mr. Trumbull rang the bell of the apartment thrice, with an interval betwixt each, during
which he told deliberately the number twenty. Immediately after the third ringing the landlord
appeared, with stealthy step, and an appearance of mystery on his buxom visage. He greeted
Mr. Trumbull, who was his landlord as it proved, with great respect, and expressed some surprise
at seeing him so late, as he termed it, 'on Saturday e'en.'

'And I, Robin Hastie,' said the landlord to the tenant, am more surprised than pleased, to
hear sae muckle din in your house, Robie, so near the honourable Sabbath; and I must mind you
that it is contravening the terms of your tack, whilk stipulates that you should shut your
public on Saturday at nine o'clock, at latest.'

'Yes, sir,' said Robin Hastie, no way alarmed at the gravity of the rebuke, 'but you must take
tent that I have admitted naebody but you, Mr. Trumbull (who by the way admitted yoursell),
since nine o'clock for the most of the folk have been here for several hours about the lading,
and so on, of the brig. It is not full tide yet, and I cannot put the men out into the street.
If I did, they would go to some other public, and their souls would be nane the better, and
my purse muckle the waur; for how am I to pay the rent if I do not sell the liquor?'

'Nay, then,' said Thomas Trumbull, 'if it is a work of necessity, and in the honest independent
way of business, no doubt there is balm in Gilead. But prithee, Robin, wilt thou see if Nanty
Ewart be, as is most likely, amongst these unhappy topers; and if so, let him step this way
cannily, and speak to me and this young gentleman. And it's dry talking, Robin--you must minister
to us a bowl of punch--ye ken my gage.'

'From a mutchkin to a gallon, I ken your honour's taste, Mr. Thomas Trumbull,' said mine host;
'and ye shall hang me over the signpost if there be a drap mair lemon or a curn less sugar
than just suits you. There are three of you--you will be for the auld Scots peremptory pint-stoup
for the success of the voyage?' [The Scottish pint of liquid measure comprehends four English
measures of the same denomination. The jest is well known of my poor countryman, who, driven
to extremity by the raillery of the Southern, on the small denomination of the Scottish coin,
at length answered, 'Aye, aye! But the deil tak them that has the LEAST PINT-STOUP.']

'Better pray for it than drink for it, Robin,' said Mr. Trumbull. 'Yours is a dangerous trade,
Robin; it hurts mony a ane--baith host and guest. But ye will get the blue bowl, Robin--the
blue bowl--that will sloken all their drouth, and prevent the sinful repetition of whipping
for an eke of a Saturday at e'en. Aye, Robin, it is a pity of Nanty Ewart--Nanty likes the
turning up of his little finger unco weel, and we maunna stint him, Robin, so as we leave him
sense to steer by.'

'Nanty Ewart could steer through the Pentland Firth though he were as drunk as the Baltic Ocean,'
said Robin Hastie; and instantly tripping downstairs, he speedily returned with the materials
for what he called his BROWST, which consisted of two English quarts of spirits, in a huge
blue bowl, with all the ingredients for punch in the same formidable proportion. At the same
time he introduced Mr. Antony or Nanty Ewart, whose person, although he was a good deal flustered
with liquor, was different from what Fairford expected. His dress was what is emphatically
termed the shabby genteel--a frock with tarnished lace--a small cocked hat, ornamented in a
similar way--a scarlet waistcoat, with faded embroidery, breeches of the same, with silver
knee-bands, and he wore a smart hanger and a pair of pistols in a sullied swordbelt.

'Here I come, patron,' he said, shaking hands with Mr. Trumbull. 'Well, I see you have got
some grog aboard.'

'It is not my custom, Mr. Ewart,' said the old gentleman, 'as you well know, to become a chamberer
or carouser thus late on Saturday at e'en; but I wanted to recommend to your attention a young
friend of ours, that is going upon a something particular journey, with a letter to our friend
the Laird from Pate-in-Peril, as they call him.'

'Aye--indeed?--he must be in high trust for so young a gentleman. I wish you joy, sir,' bowing
to Fairford. 'By'r lady, as Shakespeare says, you are bringing up a neck for a fair end. Come,
patron, we will drink to Mr. What-shall-call-um. What is his name? Did you tell me? And have
I forgot it already.'

'Mr. Alan Fairford,' said Trumbull.

'Aye, Mr. Alan Fairford--a good name for a fair trader--Mr. Alan Fairford; and may he be long
withheld from the topmost round of ambition, which I take to be the highest round of a certain
ladder.'

While he spoke, he seized the punch-ladle, and began to fill the glasses. But Mr. Trumbull
arrested his hand, until he had, as he expressed himself, sanctified the liquor by a long grace;
during the pronunciation of which he shut indeed his eyes, but his nostrils became dilated,
as if he were snuffing up the fragrant beverage with peculiar complacency.

When the grace was at length over, the three friends sat down to their beverage, and invited
Alan Fairford to partake. Anxious about his situation, and disgusted as he was with his company,
he craved, and with difficulty obtained permission, under the allegation of being fatigued,
heated, and the like, to stretch himself on a couch which was in the apartment, and attempted
at least to procure some rest before high-water, when the vessel was to sail.

He was at length permitted to use his freedom, and stretched himself on the couch, having his
eyes for some time fixed on the jovial party he had left, and straining his ears to catch if
possible a little of their conversation. This he soon found was to no purpose for what did
actually reach his ears was disguised so completely by the use of cant words and the thieves-latin
called slang, that even when he caught the words, he found himself as far as ever from the
sense of their conversation. At length he fell asleep.

It was after Alan had slumbered for three or four hours, that he was wakened by voices bidding
him rise up and prepare to be jogging. He started up accordingly, and found himself in presence
of the same party of boon companions; who had just dispatched their huge bowl of punch. To
Alan's surprise, the liquor had made but little innovation on the brains of men who were accustomed
to drink at all hours, and in the most inordinate quantities. The landlord indeed spoke a little
thick, and the texts of Mr. Thomas Trumbull stumbled on his tongue; but Nanty was one of those
topers, who, becoming early what bon vivants term flustered, remain whole nights and days at
the same point of intoxication; and, in fact, as they are seldom entirely sober, can be as
rarely seen absolutely drunk. Indeed, Fairford, had he not known how Ewart had been engaged
whilst he himself was asleep, would almost have sworn when he awoke, that the man was more
sober than when he first entered the room.

He was confirmed in this opinion when they descended below, where two or three sailors and
ruffian-looking fellows awaited their commands. Ewart took the whole direction upon himself,
gave his orders with briefness and precision, and looked to their being executed with the silence
and celerity which that peculiar crisis required. All were now dismissed for the brig, which
lay, as Fairford was given to understand, a little farther down the river, which is navigable
for vessels of light burden till almost within a mile of the town.

When they issued from the inn, the landlord bid them goodbye. Old Trumbull walked a little
way with them, but the air had probably considerable effect on the state of his brain; for
after reminding Alan Fairford that the next day was the honourable Sabbath, he became extremely
excursive in an attempt to exhort him to keep it holy. At length, being perhaps sensible that
he was becoming unintelligible, he thrust a volume into Fairford's hand--hiccuping at the same
time--'Good book--good book--fine hymn-book--fit for the honourable Sabbath, whilk awaits us
to-morrow morning.' Here the iron tongue of time told five from the town steeple of Annan,
to the further confusion of Mr. Trumbull's already disordered ideas. 'Aye? Is Sunday come and
gone already? Heaven be praised! Only it is a marvel the afternoon is sae dark for the time
of the year--Sabbath has slipped ower quietly, but we have reason to bless oursells it has
not been altogether misemployed. I heard little of the preaching--a cauld moralist, I doubt,
served that out--but, eh--the prayer--I mind it as if I had said the words mysell.' Here he
repeated one or two petitions, which were probably a part of his family devotions, before he
was summoned forth to what he called the way of business. 'I never remember a Sabbath pass
so cannily off in my life.' Then he recollected himself a little, and said to Alan, 'You may
read that book, Mr. Fairford, to-morrow, all the same, though it be Monday; for, you see, it
was Saturday when we were thegither, and now it's Sunday and it's dark night--so the Sabbath
has slipped clean away through our fingers like water through a sieve, which abideth not; and
we have to begin again to-morrow morning, in the weariful, base, mean, earthly employments,
whilk are unworthy of an immortal spirit--always excepting the way of business.'

Three of the fellows were now returning to the town, and, at Ewart's command, they cut short
the patriarch's exhortation, by leading him back to his own residence. Aye degree.

When the voyager was awakened by the light of the sun now riding high in heaven, he found himself
under the influence of an almost intolerable headache, with heat, thirst, shooting across the
back and loins, and other symptoms intimating violent cold, accompanied with fever. Was this scale-stamp

3. He felt this was the case, yet would fain have combated
the symptoms of indisposition, which, indeed, he imputed chiefly to sea-sickness. He sat up
on deck, and looked on the scene around, as the little vessel, having borne down the Solway
Firth, was beginning, with a favourable northerly breeze, to bear away to the southward, crossing
the entrance of the Wampool river, and preparing to double the most northerly point of Cumberland.

But Fairford felt annoyed with deadly sickness, as well as by pain of a distressing and oppressive
character; and neither Criffel, rising in majesty on the one hand, nor the distant yet more
picturesque outline of Skiddaw and Glaramara upon the other, could attract his attention in
the manner in which it was usually fixed by beautiful scenery, and especially that which had
in it something new as well as striking. Yet it was not in Alan Fairford's nature to give way
to despondence, even when seconded by pain. He had recourse, in the first place, to his pocket;
but instead of the little Sallust he had brought with him, that the perusal of a classical
author might help to pass away a heavy hour, he pulled out the supposed hymn-book with which
he had been presented a few hours before, by that temperate and scrupulous person, Mr. Thomas
Trumbull, ALIAS Turnpenny. The volume was bound in sable, and its exterior might have become
a psalter. But what was Alan's astonishment to read on the title page the following words:--'Merry
Thoughts for Merry Men; or Mother Midnight's Miscellany for the Small Hours;' and turning over
the leaves, he was disgusted with profligate tales, and more profligate songs, ornamented with
figures corresponding in infamy with the letterpress.

'Good God!' he thought, 'and did this hoary reprobate summon his family together, and, with
such a disgraceful pledge of infamy in his bosom, venture to approach the throne of his Creator?
It must be so; the book is bound after the manner of those dedicated to devotional subjects,
and doubtless the wretch, in his intoxication, confounded the books he carried with him, as
he did the days of the week.' Seized with the disgust with which the young and generous usually
regard the vices of advanced life, Alan, having turned the leaves of the book over in hasty
disdain, flung it from him, as far as he could, into the sea. He then had recourse to the Sallust,
which he had at first sought for in vain. As he opened the book, Nanty Ewart, who had been
looking over his shoulder, made his own opinion heard.

'I think now, brother, if you are so much scandalized at a little piece of sculduddery, which,
after all, does nobody any harm, you had better have given it to me than have flung it into
the Solway.'

'I hope, sir,' answered Fairford, civilly, 'you are in the habit of reading better books.'

'Faith,' answered Nanty, 'with help of a little Geneva text, I could read my Sallust as well
as you can;' and snatching the book from Alan's hand, he began to read, in the Scottish accent:--"'IGITUR
EX DIVITIIS JUVENTUTEM LUXURIA ATQUE AVARITIA CUM SUPERBILI INVASERE: RAPERE, CONSUMERE; SUA
PARVI PENDERE, ALIENA CUPERE; PUDOREM, AMICITIAM, PUDICITIAM, DIVINA ATQUE HUMANA PROMISCUA,
NIHIL PENSI NEQUE MODERATI HABERE." [The translation of the passage is thus given by Sir Henry
Steuart of Allanton:--'The youth, taught to look up to riches as the sovereign good, became
apt pupils in the school of Luxury. Rapacity and profusion went hand in hand. Careless of their
own fortunes, and eager to possess those of others, shame and remorse, modesty and moderation,
every principle gave way.'--WORKS OF SALLUST, WITH ORIGINAL ESSAYS, vol. ii. p.17.]--There
is a slap in the face now, for an honest fellow that has been buccaneering! Never could keep
a groat of what he got, or hold his fingers from what belonged to another, said you? Fie, fie,
friend Crispus, thy morals are as crabbed and austere as thy style--the one has as little mercy
as the other has grace. By my soul, it is unhandsome to make personal reflections on an old
acquaintance, who seeks a little civil intercourse with you after nigh twenty years' separation. 150 viii Dorcas.

CHAPTER XIV

NARRATIVE OF ALAN FAIRFORD, CONTINUED

We left Alan Fairford on the deck of the little smuggling brig, in that disconsolate situation,
when sickness and nausea, attack a heated and fevered frame, and an anxious mind. His share
of sea-sickness, however, was not so great as to engross his sensations entirely, or altogether
to divert his attention from what was passing around. If he could not delight in the swiftness
and agility with which the 'little frigate' walked the waves, or amuse himself by noticing
the beauty of the sea-views around him, where the distant Skiddaw raised his brow, as if in
defiance of the clouded eminence of Criffel, which lorded it over the Scottish side of the
estuary, he had spirits and composure enough to pay particular attention to the master of the
vessel, on whose character his own safety in all probability was dependent.

Nanty Ewart had now given the helm to one of his people, a bald-pated, grizzled old fellow,
whose whole life had been spent in evading the revenue laws, with now and then the relaxation
of a few months' imprisonment, for deforcing officers, resisting seizures, and the like offences.

Nanty himself sat down by Fairford, helped him to his tea, with such other refreshments as
he could think of, and seemed in his way sincerely desirous to make his situation as comfortable
as things admitted. Fairford had thus an opportunity to study his countenance and manners more
closely.

It was plain, Ewart, though a good seaman, had not been bred upon that element. He was a reasonably
good scholar, and seemed fond of showing it by recurring to the subject of Sallust and Juvenal;
while, on the other hand, sea-phrases seldom chequered his conversation. He had been in person
what is called a smart little man; but the tropical sun had burnt his originally fair complexion
to a dusty red; and the bile which was diffused through his system, had stained it with a yellowish
black--what ought to have been the white part of his eyes, in particular, had a hue as deep
as the topaz. He was very thin, or rather emaciated, and his countenance, though still indicating
alertness and activity, showed a constitution exhausted with excessive use of his favourite
stimulus.

'I see you look at me hard,' said he to Fairford. 'Had you been an officer of the d--d customs,
my terriers' backs would have been up. He opened his breast, and showed Alan a pair of pistols
disposed between his waistcoat and jacket, placing his finger at the same time upon the cock
of one of them. 'But come, you are an honest fellow, though you're a close one. I dare say
you think me a queer customer; but I can tell you, they that see the ship leave harbour know
little of the seas she is to sail through. My father, honest old gentleman, never would have
thought to see me master of the JUMPING JENNY.'

Fairford said, it seemed very clear indeed that Mr. Ewart's education was far superior to the
line he at present occupied.

'Oh, Criffel to Solway Moss!' said the other. Why, man, I should have been an expounder of
the word, with a wig like a snow-wreath, and a stipend like--like--like a hundred pounds a
year, I suppose. I can spend thrice as much as that, though, being such as I am. Here he sang
a scrap of an old Northumbrian ditty, mimicking the burr of the natives of that county:--

  'Willy Foster's gone to sea,
   Siller buckles at his knee,
   He'll come back and marry me--
              Canny Willy Foster.'

'I have no doubt,' said Fairford, 'your present occupation is more lucrative; 'but I should
have thought the Church might have been more'--

He stopped, recollecting that it was not his business to say anything disagreeable.

'More respectable, you mean, I suppose?' said Ewart, with a sneer, and squirting the tobacco-juice
through his front teeth; then was silent for a moment, and proceeded in a tone of candour which
some internal touch of conscience dictated. 'And so it would, Mr. Fairford--and happier, too,
by a thousand degrees--though I have had my pleasures too. But there was my father (God bless
the old man!) a true chip of the old Presbyterian block, walked his parish like a captain on
the quarterdeck, and was always ready to do good to rich and poor--Off went the laird's hat
to the minister, as fast as the poor man's bonnet. When the eye saw him--Pshaw! what have I
to do with that now?--Yes, he was, as Virgil hath it, "VIR SAPIENTIA ET PIETATE GRAVIS." But
he might have been the wiser man, had he kept me at home, when he sent me at nineteen to study
Divinity at the head of the highest stair in the Covenant Close. It was a cursed mistake in
the old gentleman. What though Mrs. Cantrips of Kittlebasket (for she wrote herself no less)
was our cousin five times removed, and took me on that account to board and lodging at six
shillings instead of seven shillings a week? it was a d--d bad saving, as the case proved.
Yet her very dignity might have kept me in order; for she never read a chapter excepting out
of a Cambridge Bible, printed by Daniel, and bound in embroidered velvet. I think I see it
at this moment! And on Sundays, when we had a quart of twopenny ale, instead of butter-milk,
to our porridge, it was always served up in a silver posset-dish. Also she used silver-mounted
spectacles, whereas even my father's were cased in mere horn. These things had their impression
at first, but we get used to grandeur by degrees. Well, sir!--Gad, I can scarce get on with
my story--it sticks in my throat--must take a trifle to wash it down. Well, this dame had a
daughter--Jess Cantrips, a black-eyed, bouncing wench--and, as the devil would have it, there
was the d--d five-story stair--her foot was never from it, whether I went out or came home
from the Divinity Hall. I would have eschewed her, sir--I would, on my soul; for I was as innocent
a lad as ever came from Lammermuir; but there was no possibility of escape, retreat, or flight,
unless I could have got a pair of wings, or made use of a ladder seven stories high, to scale
the window of my attic. It signifies little talking--you may suppose how all this was to end--I
would have married the girl, and taken my chance--I would, by Heaven! for she was a pretty
girl, and a good girl, till she and I met; but you know the old song, "Kirk would not let us
