SPECIMENS WITH MEMOIRS OF THE LESS-KNOWN BRITISH POETS.

SECOND PERIOD--FROM SPENSER TO DRYDEN. (CONTINUED.)

       *       *       *       *       *

WILLIAM HABINGTON.

This poet might have been expected to have belonged to the 'Spasmodic school,' judging by his
parental antecedents. His father was accused of having a share in Babington's conspiracy, but
was released because he was godson to Queen Elizabeth. Soon after, however, he was imprisoned
a second time, and condemned to death on the charge of having concealed some of the Gunpowder-plot
conspirators; but was pardoned through the interest of Lord Morley. His uncle, however, was
less fortunate, suffering death for his complicity with Babington. The poet's mother, the daughter
of Lord Morley, was more loyal than her husband or his brother, and is said to have written
the celebrated letter to Lord Monteagle, in consequence of which the execution of the Gunpowder-plot
was arrested.

Our poet was born at Hindlip, Worcestershire, on the very day of the discovery of the plot,
5th November 1605. The family were Papists, and William was sent to St Omers to be educated.
He was pressed to become a Jesuit, but declined. On his return to England, his father became
preceptor to the poet. As he grew up, instead of displaying any taste for 'treasons, stratagems,
and spoils,' he chose the better part, and lived a private and happy life. He fell in love
with Lucia, daughter of William Herbert, the first Lord Powis, and celebrated her in his long
and curious poem entitled 'Castara.' This lady he afterwards married, and from her society
appears to have derived much happiness. In 1634, he published 'Castara.' He also, at different
times, produced 'The Queen of Arragon,' a tragedy; a History of Edward IV.; and 'Observations
upon History.' He died in 1654, (not as Southey, by a strange oversight, says, 'when he had
just completed his fortieth year,') forty-nine years of age, and was buried in the family vault
at Hindlip.

'Castara' is not a consecutive poem, but consists of a great variety of small pieces, in all
sorts of style and rhythm, and of all varieties of merit; many of them addressed to his mistress
under the name of Castara, and many to his friends; with reflective poems, elegies, and panegyrics,
intermingled with verses sacred to love. Habington is distinguished by purity of tone if not
of taste. He has many conceits, but no obscenities. His love is as holy as it is ardent. He
has, besides, a vein of sentiment which sometimes approaches the moral sublime. To prove this,
in addition to the 'Selections' below, we copy some verses entitled--

'NOX NOCTI INDICAT SCIENTIAM.'--David.

  When I survey the bright
      Celestial sphere,
So rich with jewels hung, that Night
Doth like an Ethiop bride appear,

  My soul her wings doth spread,
      And heavenward flies,
The Almighty's mysteries to read
In the large volume of the skies;

  For the bright firmament
      Shoots forth no flame
So silent, but is eloquent
In speaking the Creator's name.

  No unregarded star
      Contracts its light
Into so small a character,
Removed far from our human sight,

  But if we steadfast look,
      We shall discern
In it, as in some holy book,
How man may heavenly knowledge learn.

  It tells the conqueror
      That far-stretch'd power,
Which his proud dangers traffic for,
Is but the triumph of an hour;

  That, from the furthest North,
      Some nation may,
Yet undiscover'd, issue forth,
And o'er his new-got conquest sway,--

  Some nation, yet shut in
      With hills of ice,
May be let out to scourge his sin
Till they shall equal him in vice;

  And then they likewise shall
      Their ruin brave;
For, as yourselves, your empires fall,
And every kingdom hath a grave.

  Thus those celestial fires,
      Though seeming mute,
The fallacy of our desires,
And all the pride of life, confute;

  For they have watch'd since first
      The world had birth,
And found sin in itself accurst,
And nothing permanent on earth.

There is something to us particularly interesting in the history of this poet. Even as it is
pleasant to see the sides of a volcano covered with verdure, and its mouth filled with flowers,
so we like to find the fierce elements, which were inherited by Habington from his fathers,
softened and subdued in him,--the blood of the conspirator mellowed into that of the gentle
bard, who derived all his inspiration from a pure love and a mild and thoughtful religion.

EPISTLE ADDRESSED TO THE HONOURABLE W.E.

  He who is good is happy. Let the loud
Artillery of heaven break through a cloud,
And dart its thunder at him, he'll remain
Unmoved, and nobler comfort entertain,
In welcoming the approach of death, than Vice
E'er found in her fictitious paradise.
Time mocks our youth, and (while we number past
Delights, and raise our appetite to taste
Ensuing) brings us to unflatter'd age,
Where we are left to satisfy the rage
Of threat'ning death: pomp, beauty, wealth, and all
Our friendships, shrinking from the funeral.
The thought of this begets that brave disdain
With which thou view'st the world, and makes those vain
Treasures of fancy, serious fools so court,
And sweat to purchase, thy contempt or sport.
What should we covet here? Why interpose
A cloud 'twixt us and heaven? Kind Nature chose
Man's soul the exchequer where to hoard her wealth,
And lodge all her rich secrets; but by the stealth
Of her own vanity, we're left so poor,
The creature merely sensual knows more.
The learned halcyon, by her wisdom, finds
A gentle season, when the seas and winds
Are silenced by a calm, and then brings forth
The happy miracle of her rare birth,
Leaving with wonder all our arts possess'd,
That view the architecture of her nest.
Pride raiseth us 'bove justice. We bestow
Increase of knowledge on old minds, which grow
By age to dotage; while the sensitive
Part of the world in its first strength doth live.
Folly! what dost thou in thy power contain
Deserves our study? Merchants plough the main
And bring home th' Indies, yet aspire to more,
By avarice in the possession poor.
And yet that idol wealth we all admit
Into the soul's great temple; busy wit
Invents new orgies, fancy frames new rites
To show its superstition; anxious nights
Are watch'd to win its favour: while the beast
Content with nature's courtesy doth rest.
Let man then boast no more a soul, since he
Hath lost that great prerogative. But thee,
Whom fortune hath exempted from the herd
Of vulgar men, whom virtue hath preferr'd
Far higher than thy birth, I must commend,
Rich in the purchase of so sweet a friend.
And though my fate conducts me to the shade
Of humble quiet, my ambition paid
With safe content, while a pure virgin fame
Doth raise me trophies in Castara's name;
No thought of glory swelling me above
The hope of being famed for virtuous love;
Yet wish I thee, guided by the better stars,
To purchase unsafe honour in the wars,
Or envied smiles at court; for thy great race,
And merits, well may challenge the highest place.
Yet know, what busy path soe'er you tread
To greatness, you must sleep among the dead.

TO HIS NOBLEST FRIEND, J.C., ESQ.

I hate the country's dirt and manners, yet I love the silence; I embrace the wit And courtship,
flowing here in a full tide, But loathe the expense, the vanity, and pride. No place each way
is happy. Here I hold Commerce with some, who to my care unfold (After a due oath minister'd)
the height And greatness of each star shines in the state, The brightness, the eclipse, the
influence. With others I commune, who tell me whence The torrent doth of foreign discord flow;
Relate each skirmish, battle, overthrow, Soon as they happen; and by rote can tell Those German
towns, even puzzle me to spell. The cross or prosperous fate of princes they Ascribe to rashness,
cunning, or delay; And on each action comment, with more skill Than upon Livy did old Machiavel.
O busy folly! why do I my brain Perplex with the dull policies of Spain, Or quick designs of
France? Why not repair To the pure innocence o' the country air, And neighbour thee, dear friend?
Who so dost give Thy thoughts to worth and virtue, that to live Blest, is to trace thy ways.
There might not we Arm against passion with philosophy; And, by the aid of leisure, so control
Whate'er is earth in us, to grow all soul? Knowledge doth ignorance engender, when We study
mysteries of other men, And foreign plots. Do but in thy own shad (Thy head upon some flow'ry
pillow laid, Kind Nature's housewifery,) contemplate all His stratagems, who labours to enthrall
The world to his great master, and you'll find Ambition mocks itself, and grasps the wind.
Not conquest makes us great. Blood is too dear A price for glory. Honour doth appear To statesmen
like a vision in the night; And, juggler-like, works o' the deluded sight. The unbusied only
wise: for no respect Endangers them to error; they affect Truth in her naked beauty, and behold
Man with an equal eye, not bright in gold, Or tall in little; so much him they weigh As virtue
raiseth him above his clay. Thus let us value things: and since we find Time bend us toward
death, let's in our mind Create new youth, and arm against the rude Assaults of age; that no
dull solitude O' the country dead our thoughts, nor busy care O' the town make us to think,
where now we are, And whither we are bound. Time ne'er forgot His journey, though his steps
we number'd not.

A DESCRIPTION OF CASTARA.

1 Like the violet which, alone,
    Prospers in some happy shade,
  My Castara lives unknown,
    To no looser's eye betray'd,
      For she's to herself untrue,
      Who delights i' the public view.

2 Such is her beauty, as no arts
    Have enrich'd with borrow'd grace;
  Her high birth no pride imparts,
    For she blushes in her place.
      Folly boasts a glorious blood,
      She is noblest, being good.

3 Cautious, she knew never yet
    What a wanton courtship meant;
  Nor speaks loud, to boast her wit;
    In her silence eloquent:
      Of herself survey she takes,
      But 'tween men no difference makes.

4 She obeys with speedy will
    Her grave parents' wise commands;
  And so innocent, that ill
    She nor acts, nor understands:
      Women's feet run still astray,
      If once to ill they know the way.

5 She sails by that rock, the court,
    Where oft Honour splits her mast:
  And retiredness thinks the port
    Where her fame may anchor cast:
     Virtue safely cannot sit,
     Where vice is enthroned for wit.

6 She holds that day's pleasure best,
    Where sin waits not on delight;
  Without mask, or ball, or feast,
    Sweetly spends a winter's night:
      O'er that darkness, whence is thrust
      Prayer and sleep, oft governs lust.

7 She her throne makes reason climb;
    While wild passions captive lie:
  And, each article of time,
    Her pure thoughts to heaven fly:
      All her vows religious be,
      And her love she vows to me.

JOSEPH HALL, BISHOP OF NORWICH.

This distinguished man must not be confounded with John Hall, of whom all we know is, that
he was born at Durham in 1627,--that he was educated at Cambridge, where he published a volume
of poems,--that he practised at the bar, and that he died in 1656, in his twenty-ninth year.
One specimen of John's verses we shall quote:--

THE MORNING STAR.

Still herald of the morn: whose ray
Being page and usher to the day,
Doth mourn behind the sun, before him play;
Who sett'st a golden signal ere
The dark retire, the lark appear;
The early cooks cry comfort, screech-owls fear;
Who wink'st while lovers plight their troth,
Then falls asleep, while they are both
To part without a more engaging oath:
  Steal in a message to the eyes
  Of Julia; tell her that she lies
Too long; thy lord, the Sun, will quickly rise.
Yet it is midnight still with me;
Nay, worse, unless that kinder she
Smile day, and in my zenith seated be,
I needs a calenture must shun,
And, like an Ethiopian, hate my sun.

John's more celebrated namesake, Joseph, was born at Bristowe Park, parish of Ashby-de-la-Zouch,
Leicestershire, in 1574. He studied and took orders at Cambridge. He acted for some time as
master of the school of Tiverton, in Devonshire. It is said that the accidental preaching of
a sermon before Prince Henry first attracted attention to this eminent divine. Promotion followed
with a sure and steady course. He was chosen to accompany King James to Scotland as one of
his chaplains, and subsequently attended the famous Synod of Dort as a representative of the
English Church. He had before this, while quite a young man, (in 1597,) published, under the
title of 'Virgidemiarum,' his Satires. In the year 1600 he produced a satirical fiction, entitled,
'Mundus alter et idem;' in which, while pretending to describe a certain terra australis incognita,
he hits hard at the existent evils of the actual world. Hall was subsequently created Bishop
of Exeter, where he exposed himself to obloquy by his mildness to the Puritans. 'Had,' Campbell
justly remarked, 'such conduct been, at this critical period, pursued by the High Churchmen
in general, the history of a bloody age might have been changed into that of peace; but the
violence of Laud prevailed over the milder counsels of a Hall, an Usher, and a Corbet.' Yet
Hall was a zealous Episcopalian, and defended that form of government in a variety of pamphlets.
In the course of this controversy he carne in collision with the mighty Milton himself, who,
unable to deny the ability and learning of his opponent, tried to cover him with a deluge of
derision.

Besides these pamphlets, the Bishop produced a number of Epistles in prose, of Sermons, of
Paraphrases, and a remarkable series of 'Occasional Meditations,' which became soon, and continue
to be, popular.

Hall, who had in his early days struggled hard with narrow circumstances and neglect, seemed
to reach the climax of prosperity when he was, in 1641, created by the King Bishop of Norwich.
But having, soon after, unfortunately added his name to the Protest of the twelve prelates
against the authority of any laws which should be passed during their compulsory absence from
Parliament, he was thrown into the Tower, and subsequently threatened with sequestration. After
enduring great privations, he at last was permitted to retire to Higham, near Norwich, where,
reduced to a very miserable allowance, he continued to labour as a pastor, with unwearied assiduity,
till, in 1656, death closed his eyes, at the advanced age of eighty-two. Bishop Hall, if not
fully competent to mate with Milton, was nevertheless a giant, conspicuous even in an age when
giants were rife. He has been called the Christian Seneca, from the pith and clear sententiousness
of his prose style. His 'Meditations,' ranging over almost the whole compass of Scripture,
as well as an incredible variety of ordinary topics, are distinguished by their fertile fancy,
their glowing language, and by thought which, if seldom profound, is never commonplace, and
seems always the spontaneous and easy outcome of the author's mind. In no form of composition
does excellence depend more on spontaneity than in the meditation. The ruin of such writers
as Hervey, and, to some extent, Boyle, has been, that they seem to have set themselves elaborately
and convulsively to extract sentiment out of every object which met their eye. They seem to
say, 'We will, and we must meditate, whether the objects be interesting or not, and whether
our own moods be propitious to the exercise, or the reverse.' Hence have come exaggeration,
extravagance, and that shape of the ridiculous which mimics the sublime, and has been so admirably
exposed in Swift's 'Meditation on a Broomstick.' Hall's method is, in general, the opposite
of this. The objects on which he muses seem to have sought him, and not he them. He surrounds
himself with his thoughts unconsciously, as one gathers burs and other herbage about him by
the mere act of walking in the woods. Sometimes, indeed, he is quaint and fantastic, as in
his meditation

  'UPON THE SIGHT OF TWO SNAILS.'

  'There is much variety even in creatures of the same kind. See these
  two snails: one hath a house, the other wants it; yet both are snails,
  and it is a question whether case is the better; that which hath a
  house hath more shelter, but that which wants it hath more freedom;
  the privilege of that cover is but a burden--you see if it hath but a
  stone to climb over with what stress it draws up that artificial load,
  and if the passage proves strait finds no entrance, whereas the empty
  snail makes no difference of way. Surely it is always an ease and
  sometimes a happiness to have nothing. No man is so worthy of envy as
  he that can be cheerful in want.'

In a very different style he discourses

  'UPON HEARING OF MUSIC BY NIGHT.'

  'How sweetly doth this music sound in this dead season! In the daytime
  it would not, it could not so much affect the ear. GONDIBERT was i left

TO DAFFODILS.

TO PRIMROSES.

1 Why do ye weep, sweet babes? Can tears
            Speak grief in you,
            Who are but born
          Just as the modest morn
          Teem'd her refreshing dew?
    Alas! you have not known that shower
            That mars a flower;
            Nor felt the unkind
        Breath of a blasting wind;
        Nor are ye worn with years;
            Or warp'd, as we,
        Who think it strange to see
  Such pretty flowers, like to orphans young,
  To speak by tears before ye have a tongue.

2 Speak, whimpering younglings; and make known
            The reason why
            Ye droop and weep.
          Is it for want of sleep,
          Or childish lullaby?
    Or that ye have not seen as yet
            The violet?
            Or brought a kiss
        From that sweetheart to this?
        No, no; this sorrow shown
            By your tears shed,
        Would have this lecture read,
  'That things of greatest, so of meanest worth,
  Conceived with grief are, and with tears brought forth.'

TO BLOSSOMS.

1 Fair pledges of a fruitful tree,
      Why do ye fall so fast?
      Your date is not so past,
  But you may stay yet here awhile
      To blush and gently smile
          And go at last.

2 What, were ye born to be
      An hour or half's delight,
      And so to bid good night?
  'Tis pity Nature brought ye forth
      Merely to show your worth,
          And lose you quite.

3 But you are lovely leaves, where we
      May read how soon things have
      Their end, though ne'er so brave:
  And after they have shown their pride,
      Like you, awhile, they glide
          Into the grave.

OBERON'S PALACE.

                   Thus to a grove
Sometimes devoted unto love,
Tinsell'd with twilight, he and they,
Led by the shine of snails, a way
Beat with their num'rous feet, which by
Many a neat perplexity,
Many a turn, and many a cross
Tract, they redeem a bank of moss,
Spongy and swelling, and far more
Soft than the finest Lemster ore,
Mildly disparkling like those fires
Which break from the enjewell'd tires
Of curious brides, or like those mites
Of candied dew in moony nights;
Upon this convex all the flowers
Nature begets by the sun and showers,
Are to a wild digestion brought;
As if Love's sampler here was wrought
Or Cytherea's ceston, which
All with temptation doth bewitch.
Sweet airs move here, and more divine
Made by the breath of great-eyed kine
Who, as they low, impearl with milk
The four-leaved grass, or moss-like silk.
The breath of monkeys, met to mix
With musk-flies, are the aromatics
Which cense this arch; and here and there,
And further off, and everywhere
Throughout that brave mosaic yard,
Those picks or diamonds in the card,
With pips of hearts, of club, and spade,
Are here most neatly interlaid.
Many a counter, many a die,
Half-rotten and without an eye,
Lies hereabout; and for to pave
The excellency of this cave,
Squirrels' and children's teeth, late shed,
Are neatly here inchequered
With brownest toadstones, and the gum
That shines upon the bluer plumb.

       *       *       *       *       *

                             Art's
Wise hand enchasing here those warts
Which we to others from ourselves
Sell, and brought hither by the elves.
The tempting mole, stolen from the neck
Of some shy virgin, seems to deck
The holy entrance; where within
The room is hung with the blue skin
Of shifted snake, enfriezed throughout
With eyes of peacocks' trains, and trout--
Flies' curious wings; and these among
Those silver pence, that cut the tongue
Of the red infant, neatly hung.
The glow-worm's eyes, the shining scales
Of silvery fish, wheat-straws, the snail's
Soft candlelight, the kitling's eyne,
Corrupted wood, serve here for shine;
No glaring light of broad-faced day,
Or other over-radiant ray
Ransacks this room, but what weak beams
Can make reflected from these gems,
And multiply; such is the light,
But ever doubtful, day or night.
By this quaint taper-light he winds
His errors up; and now he finds
His moon-tann'd Mab as somewhat sick,
And, love knows, tender as a chick.
Upon six plump dandelions high-
Rear'd lies her elvish majesty,
Whose woolly bubbles seem'd to drown
Her Mabship in obedient down.

       *       *       *       *       *

And next to these two blankets, o'er- Cast of the finest gossamer; And then a rug of carded
wool, Which, sponge-like, drinking in the dull Light of the moon, seem'd to comply, Cloud-like,
the dainty deity: Thus soft she lies; and overhead A spinner's circle is bespread With cobweb
curtains, from the roof So neatly sunk, as that no proof Of any tackling can declare What gives
it hanging in the air.

       *       *       *       *       *

OBERON'S FEAST.

Shapcot, to thee the fairy state I with discretion dedicate; Because thou prizest things that
are Curious and unfamiliar. Take first the feast; these dishes gone, We'll see the fairy court
anon.

A little mushroom table spread; After short prayers, they set on bread, A moon-parch'd grain
of purest wheat, With some small glittering grit, to eat His choicest bits with; then in a
trice They make a feast less great than nice. But, all this while his eye is served, We must
not think his ear was starved; But there was in place, to stir His spleen, the chirring grasshopper,
The merry cricket, puling fly, The piping gnat, for minstrelsy. And now we must imagine first
The elves present, to quench his thirst, A pure seed-pearl of infant dew, Brought and besweeten'd
in a blue And pregnant violet; which done, His kitling eyes begin to run Quite through the
table, where he spies The horns of pap'ry butterflies, Of which he eats; and tastes a little
Of what we call the cuckoo's spittle: A little furze-ball pudding stands By, yet not blessed
by his hands-- That was too coarse; but then forthwith He ventures boldly on the pith Of sugar'd
rush, and eats the sag And well-bestrutted bee's sweet bag; Gladding his palate with some store
Of emmets' eggs: what would he more But beards of mice, a newt's stew'd thigh, A bloated earwig,
and a fly: With the red-capp'd worm, that is shut Within the concave of a nut, Brown as his
tooth; a little moth, Late fatten'd in a piece of cloth; With wither'd cherries; mandrakes'
ears; Moles' eyes; to these, the slain stag's tears; The unctuous dewlaps of a snail; The broke
heart of a nightingale O'ercome in music; with a wine Ne'er ravish'd from the flatt'ring rine,
But gently press'd from the soft side Of the most sweet and dainty bride, Brought in a dainty
daisy, which He fully quaffs up to bewitch His blood to height? This done, commended Grace
by his priest, the feast is ended.

THE MAD MAID'S SONG.

1 Good-morrow to the day so fair;
    Good-morning, sir, to you;
  Good-morrow to mine own torn hair,
    Bedabbled with the dew:

2 Good-morning to this primrose too;
    Good-morrow to each maid,
  That will with flowers the tomb bestrew
    Wherein my love is laid.

3 Ah, woe is me; woe, woe is me!
    Alack, and well-a-day!
  For pity, sir, find out this bee
    Which bore my love away.

4 I'll seek him in your bonnet brave,
    I'll seek him in your eyes;
  Nay, now I think they've made his grave
    I' th' bed of strawberries:

5 I'll seek him there; I know ere this
    The cold, cold earth doth shake him;
  But I will go, or send a kiss
    By you, sir, to awake him.

6 Pray hurt him not; though he be dead,
    He knows well who do love him,
  And who with green turfs rear his head,
    And who do rudely move him.

7 He's soft and tender, pray take heed,
    With bands of cowslips bind him,
  And bring him home;--but 'tis decreed
    That I shall never find him!

CORINNA'S GOING A-MAYING.

1 Get up, get up for shame; the blooming morn
  Upon her wings presents the god unshorn:
      See how Aurora throws her fair
      Fresh-quilted colours through the air:
      Get up, sweet slug-a-bed, and see
      The dew bespangling herb and tree:
  Each flower has wept, and bow'd toward the east,
  Above an hour since; yet you are not drest;
      Nay, not so much as out of bed;
      When all the birds have matins said,
      And sung their thankful hymns; 'tis sin,
      Nay, profanation, to keep in;
  When as a thousand virgins on this day,
  Spring sooner than the lark, to fetch in May!

2 Rise and put on your foliage, and be seen
  To come forth like the spring-time, fresh and green,
      And sweet as Flora. Take no care
      For jewels for your gown, or hair:
      Fear not, the leaves will strew
      Gems in abundance upon you:
  Besides, the childhood of the day has kept,
  Against you come, some orient pearls unwept:
      Come and receive them, while the light
      Hangs on the dew-locks of the night,
      And Titan on the eastern hill
      Retires himself, or else stands still
  Till you come forth. Wash, dress, be brief in praying;
  Few beads are best, when once we go a-Maying!

3 Come, my Corinna, come; and, coming, mark
  How each field turns a street, each street a park
      Made green, and trimm'd with trees; see how
      Devotion gives each house a bough,
      Or branch; each porch, each door, ere this
      An ark, a tabernacle is
  Made up of whitethorn newly interwove,
  As if here were those cooler shades of love.
      Can such delights be in the street
      And open fields, and we not see't?
      Come, we'll abroad; and let's obey
      The proclamation made for May,
  And sin no more, as we have done, by staying;
  But, my Corinna, come, let's go a-Maying!

4 There's not a budding boy or girl this day
  But is got up, and gone to bring in May:
      A deal of youth, ere this, is come
      Back, and with whitethorn laden home:
      Some have despatch'd their cakes and cream,
      Before that we have left to dream;
  And some have wept, and woo'd, and plighted troth,
  And chose their priest, ere we can cast off sloth:
      Many a green gown has been given;
      Many a kiss, both odd and even;
      Many a glance too has been sent
      From out the eye, love's firmament;
  Many a jest told of the key's betraying
  This night, and locks pick'd; yet we're not a-Maying!

5 Come, let us go, while we are in our prime,
  And take the harmless folly of the time:
      We shall grow old apace, and die
      Before we know our liberty:
      Our life is short, and our days run
      As fast away as does the sun:
  And, as a vapour, or a drop of rain,
  Once lost, can ne'er be found again,
      So when or you, or I, are made
      A fable, song, or fleeting shade,
      All love, all liking, all delight
      Lies drown'd with us in endless night.
  Then, while time serves, and we are but decaying,
  Come, my Corinna, come, let's go a-Maying!

JEPHTHAH'S DAUGHTER.

1  O thou, the wonder of all days!
   O paragon and pearl of praise!
   O Virgin Martyr! ever bless'd
                 Above the rest
   Of all the maiden train! we come,
   And bring fresh strewings to thy tomb.

2  Thus, thus, and thus we compass round
   Thy harmless and enchanted ground;
   And, as we sing thy dirge, we will
                 The daffodil
   And other flowers lay upon
   The altar of our love, thy stone.

3  Thou wonder of all maids! list here,
   Of daughters all the dearest dear;
   The eye of virgins, nay, the queen
                 Of this smooth green,
   And all sweet meads, from whence we get
   The primrose and the violet.

4  Too soon, too dear did Jephthah buy,
   By thy sad loss, our liberty:
   His was the bond and cov'nant; yet
                 Thou paid'st the debt,
   Lamented maid! He won the day,
   But for the conquest thou didst pay.

5  Thy father brought with him along
   The olive branch and victor's song:
   He slew the Ammonites, we know,
                 But to thy woe;
   And, in the purchase of our peace,
   The cure was worse than the disease.

6  For which obedient zeal of thine,
   We offer thee, before thy shrine,
   Our sighs for storax, tears for wine;
                 And to make fine
   And fresh thy hearse-cloth, we will here
   Four times bestrew thee every year.

7  Receive, for this thy praise, our tears;
   Receive this offering of our hairs;
   Receive these crystal vials, fill'd
                 With tears distill'd
   From teeming eyes; to these we bring,
   Each maid, her silver filleting,

8  To gild thy tomb; besides, these cauls,
   These laces, ribands, and these fauls,
   These veils, wherewith we used to hide
                 The bashful bride,
   When we conduct her to her groom:
   All, all, we lay upon thy tomb.

10 No, no; our maiden pleasures be
   Wrapt in a winding-sheet with thee;
   'Tis we are dead, though not i' th' grave,
                 Or if we have
   One seed of life left,'tis to keep
   A Lent for thee, to fast and weep.
   Let balm and cassia send their scent
   From out thy maiden-monument.

12 May no wolf howl or screech-owl stir
   A wing upon thy sepulchre!

THE COUNTRY LIFE.

Sweet country life, to such unknown Whose lives are others', not their own! But serving courts
and cities, be Less happy, less enjoying thee! Thou never plough'st the ocean's foam To seek
and bring rough pepper home; Nor to the Eastern Ind dost rove, To bring from thence the scorched
clove: Nor, with the loss of thy loved rest, Bring'st home the ingot from the West. No: thy
ambition's masterpiece Flies no thought higher than a fleece; Or how to pay thy hinds, and
clear All scores, and so to end the year; But walk'st about thy own dear bounds, Not envying
others' larger grounds: For well thou know'st, 'tis not the extent Of land makes life, but
sweet content. When now the cock, the ploughman's horn, Calls forth the lily-wristed morn,
Then to thy corn-fields thou dost go, Which though well-soil'd, yet thou dost know That the
best compost for the lands Is the wise master's feet and hands. There at the plough thou find'st
thy team, With a hind whistling there to them; And cheer'st them up by singing how The kingdom's
portion is the plough. This done, then to th' enamell'd meads, Thou go'st; and as thy foot
there treads, Thou seest a present godlike power Imprinted in each herb and flower; And smell'st
the breath of great-eyed kine, Sweet as the blossoms of the vine. Here thou behold'st thy large
sleek neat Unto the dewlaps up in meat; And, as thou look'st, the wanton steer, The heifer,
cow, and ox, draw near, To make a pleasing pastime there. These seen, thou go'st to view thy
flocks Of sheep, safe from the wolf and fox; And find'st their bellies there as full Of short
sweet grass, as backs with wool; And leav'st them as they feed and fill; A shepherd piping
on a hill. For sports, for pageantry, and plays, Thou hast thy eves and holidays; On which
the young men and maids meet, To exercise their dancing feet; Tripping the comely country round,
With daffodils and daisies crown'd. Thy wakes, thy quintels, here thou hast; Thy May-poles
too, with garlands graced; Thy morris-dance, thy Whitsun-ale, Thy shearing feast, which never
fail; Thy harvest-home, thy wassail-bowl, That's toss'd up after fox i' the hole; Thy mummeries,
thy Twelfth-night kings And queens, thy Christmas revellings; Thy nut-brown mirth, thy russet
wit; And no man pays too dear for it. To these thou hast thy times to go, And trace the hare
in the treacherous snow; Thy witty wiles to draw, and get The lark into the trammel net; Thou
hast thy cockrood, and thy glade To take the precious pheasant made; Thy lime-twigs, snares,
and pitfalls, then, To catch the pilfering birds, not men.

O happy life, if that their good The husbandmen but understood! Who all the day themselves
do please, And younglings, with such sports as these; And, lying down, have nought to affright
Sweet sleep, that makes more short the night.

SIR RICHARD FANSHAWE.

This gallant knight was son to Sir Henry Fanshawe, who was Remembrancer to the Irish Exchequer,
and brother to Thomas Lord Fanshawe. He was born at Ware, in Hertfordshire, in 1607-8. He became
a vehement Royalist, and acted for some time as Secretary to Prince Rupert, and was, in truth,
a kindred spirit, worthy of recording the orders of that fiery spirit--the Murat of the Royal
cause--to whom the dust of the melee of battle was the very breath of life. After the Restoration,
Fanshawe was appointed ambassador to Spain and Portugal. He acted in this capacity at Madrid
in 1666. He had issued translations of the 'Lusiad' of Camoens, and the 'Pastor Fido' of Guarini.
Along with the latter, which appeared in 1648, he published some original poems of considerable
merit. He holds altogether a respectable, if not a very high place among our early translators
and minor poets.

THE SPRING, A SONNET. FROM THE SPANISH.

Those whiter lilies which the early morn
  Seems to have newly woven of sleaved silk,
To which, on banks of wealthy Tagus born,
  Gold was their cradle, liquid pearl their milk.

These blushing roses, with whose virgin leaves
  The wanton wind to sport himself presumes,
Whilst from their rifled wardrobe he receives
  For his wings purple, for his breath perfumes.

Both those and these my Caelia's pretty foot
  Trod up; but if she should her face display,
And fragrant breast, they'd dry again to the root,
  As with the blasting of the mid-day's ray;
And this soft wind, which both perfumes and cools,
Pass like the unregarded breath of fools.

ABRAHAM COWLEY.

The 'melancholy' and musical Cowley was born in London in the year 1618. He was the posthumous
son of a worthy grocer, who lived in Fleet Street, near the end of Chancery Lane, and who is
supposed, from the omission of his name in the register of St Dunstan's parish, to have been
a Dissenter. His mother was left poor, but had a strong desire for her son's education, and
influence to get him admitted as a king's scholar into Westminster. His mind was almost preternaturally
precocious, and received early a strong and peculiar stimulus. A copy of Spenser lay in the
window of his mother's apartment, and in it he delighted to read, and became the devoted slave
of poetry ever after. When only ten he wrote 'The Tragical History of Pyramus and Thisbe,'
and at twelve 'Constantia and Philetus.' Pope wrote a lampoon about the same age as Cowley
these romantic narratives; and we have seen a pretty good copy of verses on Napoleon, written
at the age of seven, by one of the most distinguished rising poets of our own day. When fifteen
(Johnson calls it thirteen, but he and some other biographers were misled by the portrait of
the poet being, by mistake, marked thirteen) Cowley published some of his early effusions,
under the title of 'Poetical Blossoms.' While at school he produced a comedy of a pastoral
kind, entitled, 'Love's Riddle,' but it was not published till he went to Cambridge. To that
university he proceeded in 1636, and two years after, there appeared the above-mentioned comedy,
with a poetical dedication to Sir Kenelm Digby, one of the marvellous men of that age; and
also 'Naufragium Joculare,' a comedy in Latin, inscribed to Dr Comber, master of the college.
When the Prince of Wales afterwards visited Cambridge, the fertile Cowley got up the rough
draft of another comedy, called 'The Guardian,' which was repeated to His Royal Highness by
the scholars. This was afterwards, to the poet's great annoyance, printed during his absence
from the country. In 1643 he took his degree of A.M., and was, the same year, through the prevailing
influence of the Parliament, ejected, with many others, from Cambridge. He took refuge in St
John's College, Oxford, where he published a satire, entitled 'The Puritan and Papist,' and
where, by his loyalty and genius, he gained the favour of such distinguished courtiers as Lord
Falkland. During this agitated period he resided a good deal in the family of the Lord St Albans;
and when Oxford fell into the hands of the Parliament he followed the Queen to Paris, and there
acted as Secretary to the same noble lord. He remained abroad about ten years, and during that
period made various journeys in the furtherance of the Royal cause, visiting Flanders, Holland,
Jersey, Scotland, &c. His chief employment, however, was carrying on a correspondence in cipher
between the King and the Queen. Sprat says, 'he ciphered and deciphered with his own hand the
greatest part of the letters that passed between their Majesties, and managed a vast intelligence
in other parts, which, for some years together, took up all his days and two or three nights
every week.' This does not seem employment very suitable to a man of genius. He seems, however,
to have found time for more congenial avocations; and, in 1647, he published his 'Mistress,'
a work which seems to glow with amorous fire, although Barnes relates of the author that he
was never in love but once, and then had not resolution to reveal his passion. And yet he wrote
'The Chronicle,' from which we might infer that his heart was completely tinder, and that his
series of love attachments had been an infinite one! In the same year he published a collection
of his poems, with a querulous preface, in which he expresses a strong desire to 'retire to
some of the American plantations, and to forsake the world for ever.' Meanwhile he gave himself
out as a physician till the death of Cromwell, when he returned to France, resumed his former
occupation, and remained till the Restoration. In 1657 he was created Doctor of Medicine at
Oxford. Having studied botany to qualify himself for his physician's degree, he was induced
to publish in Latin some books on plants, flowers, and trees.

The Restoration brought him less advantage than he had anticipated. Probably he expected too
much, and had expressed his sanguine hopes in a song of triumph on the occasion. He had been
promised, both by Charles I. and Charles II., the Mastership of the Savoy, (a forgotten sinecure
office;) but lost it, says Wood, 'by certain persons, enemies to the Muses.' He brought on
the stage at this time his old comedy of 'The Guardian,' under the title of 'Cutter of Coleman
Street;' but it was thought a satire on the debauchery of the King's party, and was received
with coldness. In this he calls himself the 'melancholy Cowley,' an epithet which has stuck
to his memory.

He had always, according to his own statement, loved retirement. When he was a young boy at
school, instead of running about on holidays, and playing with his fellows, he was wont to
steal from them, and walk into the fields alone with a book. This passion had been overlaid,
but not extinguished, during his public life; and now, swelled by disgust, it came back upon
him in great strength. He seems, too, if we can believe Sprat, to have had an extraordinary
attachment to Nature, as it 'was God's;' to the whole 'compass of the creation, and all the
wonderful effects of the Divine wisdom.' At all events, he retired first to Barn Elms, and
then to Chertsey in Surrey. He had obtained, through Lord St Albans and the Duke of Buckingham,
the lease of some lands belonging to the Queen, which brought him in an income of L300 a year.
Here, then, having, at the age of forty-two, reached the peaceful hermitage,' he set himself
with all his might to enjoy it. He cultivated his fields, and renewed his botanical studies
in his woods and garden. He wrote letters to his friends, which are said to have been admirable,
and might have ranked with those of Gray and Cowper, but unfortunately they have not been preserved.
He renewed his intimacy with the Greek and Latin poets, and he set himself to retouch the 'Davideis,'
which he had begun in early youth, but which he never lived to finish, and to compose his beautiful
prose essays. But he soon found that Chertsey, no more than Paris, was Paradise. He had no
wife nor children. He had sweet solitude, but no one near him to whom to whisper 'how sweet
this solitude is!' The peasants were boors. His tenants would pay him no rent, and the cattle
of his neighbours devoured his meadows. He was troubled with rheums and colds. He met a severe
fall when he first came to Chertsey, of which he says, half in jest and half in earnest--'What
this signifies, or may come to in time, God knows; if it be ominous, it can end in nothing
less than hanging.' Robert Hall said of Bishop Watson that he seemed to have wedded political
integrity in early life, and to have spent all the rest of his days in quarrelling with his
wife. So Cowley wedded his long- sought-for bride, Solitude, and led a miserable life with
her ever after. Fortunately for him, if not for the world, his career soon came to a close.

One hot day in summer, he stayed too long among his labourers in the meadows, and was seized
with a cold, which, being neglected, carried him off on the 28th of July 1667. He was not forty-nine
years old. He died at the Porch House, Chertsey, and his remains were buried with great pomp
near Chaucer and Spenser; and King Charles, who had neglected him during life, pronounced his
panegyric after death, declaring that 'Mr Cowley had not left behind him a better man in England.'
It was in keeping with the character of Charles to make up for his deficiency in action, by
his felicity of phrase.

If we may differ from such a high authority as 'Old Rowley,' we would venture to doubt whether
Cowley was the best--certainly he was not the greatest--man then in England. Milton was alive,
and the 'Paradise Lost' appeared in the very year when the author of the 'Davideis' departed.
Cowley gives us the impression of having been an amiable and blameless, rather than a good
or great man. At all events, there was nothing active in his goodness, and his greatness could
not be called magnanimity. He was a scholar and a poet misplaced during early life; and when
he gained that retirement for which he sighed, he had, by his habits of life, lost his capacity
of relishing it. 'He that would enjoy solitude,' it has been said, 'must either be a wild beast
or a god;' and Cowley was neither. How different his grounds of dissatisfaction with the world
from those of Milton! Cowley was wearied of ciphering, and his 'Cutter of Coleman Street' had
been cut; that was nearly the whole matter of his complaint; while Milton had fallen from being
the second man in England into poverty, blindness, contempt, danger, and the disappointment
of the most glorious hopes which ever heaved the bosom of patriot or saint.

We find the want of greatness which marked the man characterising the poet. Infinite ingenuity,
a charming flexibility and abundance of fancy, a perception of remote analogies almost unrivalled,
great command of versification and language, learning without bounds, and an occasional gracefulness
and sparkling ease (as in 'The Chronicle') superior to even Herrick or Suckling, are qualities
that must be conceded to Cowley. But the most of his writings are cold and glittering as the
sun-smitten glacier. He is seldom warm, except when he is proclaiming his own merits, or bewailing
his own misfortunes. Hence his 'Wish,' and even his 'Complaint,' are very pleasing and natural
specimens of poetry. But his 'Pindaric Odes,' his 'Hymn to Light,' and most of his 'Davideis,'
while displaying great power, shew at least equal perversion, and are more memorable for their
faults than for their beauties. In the 'Davideis,' he describes the attire of Gabriel in the
spirit and language of a tailor; and there is no path so sacred or so lofty but he must sow
it with conceits,--forced, false, and chilly. His 'Anacreontics,' on the other hand, are in
general felicitous in style and aerial in motion.

In prose, Cowley is uniformly excellent. The prefaces to his poems, especially his defence
of sacred song in the prefix to the 'Davideis,' his short autobiography, the fragments of his
letters which remain, and his posthumous essays, are all distinguished by a rich simplicity
of style and by a copiousness of matter which excite in equal measure delight and surprise.
He had written, it appears, three books on the Civil War, to the time of the battle of Newbury,
which he destroyed. It is a pity, perhaps, that he had not preserved and completed the work.
His intimacy with many of the leading characters and the secret springs of that remarkable
period,--his clear and solid judgment, always so except when he was following the Daedalus
Pindar upon waxen Icarian wings, or competing with Dr Donne in the number of conceits which
he could stuff, like cloves, into his subject-matter,--and the bewitching ease and elegance
of his prose style, would have combined to render it an important contribution to English history,
and a worthy monument of its author's highly-accomplished and diversified powers.

THE CHRONICLE, A BALLAD.

1  Margarita first possess'd,
   If I remember well, my breast,
   Margarita first of all;
   But when a while the wanton maid
   With my restless heart had play'd,
   Martha took the flying ball.

2  Martha soon did it resign
   To the beauteous Catharine:
   Beauteous Catharine gave place
   (Though loth and angry she to part
   With the possession of my heart)
   To Eliza's conquering face.

3  Eliza till this hour might reign,
   Had she not evil counsels ta'en:
   Fundamental laws she broke
   And still new favourites she chose,
   Till up in arms my passions rose,
   And cast away her yoke.

4  Mary then, and gentle Anne,
   Both to reign at once began;
   Alternately they sway'd,
   And sometimes Mary was the fair,
   And sometimes Anne the crown did wear,
   And sometimes both I obey'd.

5  Another Mary then arose,
   And did rigorous laws impose;
   A mighty tyrant she!
   Long, alas! should I have been
   Under that iron-sceptred queen,
   Had not Rebecca set me free.

6  When fair Rebecca set me free,
   'Twas then a golden time with me:
   But soon those pleasures fled;
   For the gracious princess died
   In her youth and beauty's pride,
   And Judith reign'd in her stead.

7  One month, three days, and half an hour,
   Judith held the sovereign power:
   Wondrous beautiful her face,
   But so weak and small her wit,
   That she to govern was unfit,
   And so Susanna took her place.

8  But when Isabella came,
   Arm'd with a resistless flame,
   And the artillery of her eye,
   Whilst she proudly march'd about,
   Greater conquests to find out,
   She beat out Susan by the bye.

9  But in her place I then obey'd
   Black-eyed Bess, her viceroy made,
   To whom ensued a vacancy.
   Thousand worst passions then possess'd
   The interregnum of my breast.
   Bless me from such an anarchy!

10 Gentle Henrietta then,
   And a third Mary, next began:
   Then Joan, and Jane, and Audria;
   And then a pretty Thomasine,
   And then another Catharine,
   And then a long et caetera.

11 But should I now to you relate
   The strength and riches of their state,
   The powder, patches, and the pins,
   The ribands, jewels, and the rings,
   The lace, the paint, and warlike things,
   That make up all their magazines:

12 If I should tell the politic arts
   To take and keep men's hearts,
   The letters, embassies, and spies,
   The frowns, the smiles, and flatteries,
   The quarrels, tears, and perjuries,
   Numberless, nameless mysteries!

13 And all the little lime-twigs laid
   By Mach'avel the waiting-maid;
   I more voluminous should grow
   (Chiefly if I like them should tell
   All change of weathers that befell)
   Than Holinshed or Stow.

14 But I will briefer with them be,
   Since few of them were long with me.
   An higher and a nobler strain
   My present Emperess does claim,
   Heleonora! first o' the name,
   Whom God grant long to reign.

THE COMPLAINT.

In a deep vision's intellectual scene, Beneath a bower for sorrow made, The uncomfortable shade
Of the black yew's unlucky green, Mixed with the mourning willow's careful gray, Where rev'rend
Cam cuts out his famous way, The melancholy Cowley lay; And, lo! a Muse appeared to his closed
sight (The Muses oft in lands of vision play,) Bodied, arrayed, and seen by an internal light:
A golden harp with silver strings she bore, A wondrous hieroglyphic robe she wore, In which
all colours and all figures were That Nature or that Fancy can create. That Art can never imitate,
And with loose pride it wantoned in the air, In such a dress, in such a well-clothed dream,
She used of old near fair Ismenus' stream Pindar, her Theban favourite, to meet; A crown was
on her head, and wings were on her feet.

She touched him with her harp and raised him from the ground; The shaken strings melodiously
resound. 'Art thou returned at last,' said she, 'To this forsaken place and me? Thou prodigal!
who didst so loosely waste Of all thy youthful years the good estate; Art thou returned here,
to repent too late? And gather husks of learning up at last, Now the rich harvest-time of life
is past, And winter marches on so fast? But when I meant to adopt thee for my son, And did
as learned a portion assign As ever any of the mighty nine Had to their dearest children done;
When I resolved to exalt thy anointed name Among the spiritual lords of peaceful fame; Thou
changeling! thou, bewitch'd with noise and show, Wouldst into courts and cities from me go;
Wouldst see the world abroad, and have a share In all the follies and the tumults there; Thou
wouldst, forsooth, be something in a state, And business thou wouldst find, and wouldst create:
Business! the frivolous pretence Of human lusts, to shake off innocence; Business! the grave
impertinence; Business! the thing which I of all things hate; Business! the contradiction of
thy fate.

'Go, renegado! cast up thy account, And see to what amount Thy foolish gains by quitting me:
The sale of knowledge, fame, and liberty, The fruits of thy unlearned apostasy. Thou thoughtst,
if once the public storm were past, All thy remaining life should sunshine be: Behold the public
storm is spent at last, The sovereign is tossed at sea no more, And thou, with all the noble
company, Art got at last to shore: But whilst thy fellow-voyagers I see, All marched up to
possess the promised land, Thou still alone, alas! dost gaping stand, Upon the naked beach,
upon the barren sand. As a fair morning of the blessed spring, After a tedious, stormy night,
Such was the glorious entry of our king; Enriching moisture dropped on every thing: Plenty
he sowed below, and cast about him light. But then, alas! to thee alone One of old Gideon's
miracles was shown, For every tree, and every hand around, With pearly dew was crowned, And
upon all the quickened ground The fruitful seed of heaven did brooding lie, And nothing but
the Muse's fleece was dry. It did all other threats surpass, When God to his own people said,
The men whom through long wanderings he had led, That he would give them even a heaven of brass:
They looked up to that heaven in vain, That bounteous heaven! which God did not restrain Upon
the most unjust to shine and rain.

'The Rachel, for which twice seven years and more, Thou didst with faith and labour serve,
And didst (if faith and labour can) deserve, Though she contracted was to thee, Given to another,
thou didst see, who had store Of fairer and of richer wives before, And not a Loah left, thy
recompense to be. Go on, twice seven years more, thy fortune try, Twice seven years more God
in his bounty may Give thee to fling away Into the court's deceitful lottery: But think how
likely 'tis that thou, With the dull work of thy unwieldy plough, Shouldst in a hard and barren
season thrive, Shouldst even able be to live; Thou! to whose share so little bread did fall
In the miraculous year, when manna rain'd on all.'

Thus spake the Muse, and spake it with a smile, That seemed at once to pity and revile: And
to her thus, raising his thoughtful head, The melancholy Cowley said: 'Ah, wanton foe! dost
thou upbraid The ills which thou thyself hast made? When in the cradle innocent I lay, Thou,
wicked spirit, stolest me away, And my abused soul didst bear Into thy new-found worlds, I
know not where, Thy golden Indies in the air; And ever since I strive in vain My ravished freedom
to regain; Still I rebel, still thou dost reign; Lo, still in verse, against thee I complain.
There is a sort of stubborn weeds, Which, if the earth but once it ever breeds, No wholesome
herb can near them thrive, No useful plant can keep alive: The foolish sports I did on thee
bestow Make all my art and labour fruitless now; Where once such fairies dance, no grass doth
ever grow.

'When my new mind had no infusion known, Thou gavest so deep a tincture of thine own, That
ever since I vainly try To wash away the inherent dye: Long work, perhaps, may spoil thy colours
quite, But never will reduce the native white. To all the ports of honour and of gain I often
steer my course in vain; Thy gale comes cross, and drives me back again, Thou slacken'st all
my nerves of industry, By making them so oft to be The tinkling strings of thy loose minstrelsy.
Whoever this world's happiness would see Must as entirely cast off thee, As they who only heaven
desire Do from the world retire. This was my error, this my gross mistake, Myself a demi-votary
to make. Thus with Sapphira and her husband's fate, (A fault which I, like them, am taught
too late,) For all that I give up I nothing gain, And perish for the part which I retain. Teach
me not then, O thou fallacious Muse! The court and better king t' accuse; The heaven under
which I live is fair, The fertile soil will a full harvest bear: Thine, thine is all the barrenness,
if thou Makest me sit still and sing when I should plough. When I but think how many a tedious
year Our patient sovereign did attend His long misfortune's fatal end; How cheerfully, and
how exempt from fear, On the Great Sovereign's will he did depend, I ought to be accursed if
I refuse To wait on his, O thou fallacious Muse! Kings have long hands, they say, and though
I be So distant, they may reach at length to me. However, of all princes thou Shouldst not
reproach rewards for being small or slow; Thou! who rewardest but with popular breath, And
that, too, after death!'

THE DESPAIR.
  Ah, wretched youth, said I;
  Ah, wretched youth! twice did I sadly cry;
  Ah, wretched youth! the fields and floods reply.

2 When thoughts of love I entertain,
  I meet no words but Never, and In vain:
  Never! alas! that dreadful name
  Which fuels the infernal flame:
  Never! my time to come must waste;
  In vain! torments the present and the past:
  In vain, in vain! said I,
  In vain, in vain! twice did I sadly cry;
  In vain, in vain! the fields and floods reply.

3 No more shall fields or floods do so,
  For I to shades more dark and silent go:
  All this world's noise appears to me
  A dull, ill-acted comedy:
  No comfort to my wounded sight,
  In the sun's busy and impert'nent light.
  Then down I laid my head,
  Down on cold earth, and for a while was dead,
  And my freed soul to a strange somewhere fled.
  Once dead, how can it be
  Death should a thing so pleasant seem to thee,
  That thou shouldst come to live it o'er again in me?

OF WIT.

1 Tell me, O tell! what kind of thing is Wit,
  Thou who master art of it;
  For the first matter loves variety less;
  Less women love it, either in love or dress:
  A thousand different shapes it bears,
  Comely in thousand shapes appears:
  Yonder we saw it plain, and here 'tis now,
  Like spirits, in a place, we know not how.

2 London, that vends of false ware so much store,
  In no ware deceives us more:
  For men, led by the colour and the shape,
  Like Zeuxis' birds, fly to the painted grape.
  Some things do through our judgment pass,
  As through a multiplying-glass;
  And sometimes, if the object be too far,
  We take a falling meteor for a star.

3 Hence 'tis a wit, that greatest word of fame,
  Grows such a common name;
  And wits by our creation they become,
  Just so as tit'lar bishops made at Rome.
  'Tis not a tale, 'tis not a jest,
  Admired with laughter at a feast,
  Nor florid talk, which can that title gain;
  The proofs of wit for ever must remain.

4 'Tis not to force some lifeless verses meet
  With their five gouty feet;
  All everywhere, like man's, must be the soul,
  And reason the inferior powers control.
  Such were the numbers which could call
  The stones into the Theban wall.
  Such miracles are ceased; and now we see
  No towns or houses raised by poetry.

6 'Tis not when two like words make up one noise,
  Jests for Dutch men and English boys;
  In which who finds out wit, the same may see
  In an'grams and acrostics poetry.
  Much less can that have any place
  At which a virgin hides her face;
  Such dross the fire must purge away; 'tis just
  The author blush there where the reader must.

7 'Tis not such lines as almost crack the stage,
  When Bajazet begins to rage:
  Nor a tall met'phor in the bombast way,
  Nor the dry chips of short-lunged Seneca:
  Nor upon all things to obtrude
  And force some old similitude.
  What is it then, which, like the Power Divine,
  We only can by negatives define?

8 In a true piece of wit all things must be,
  Yet all things there agree:
  As in the ark, joined without force or strife,
  All creatures dwelt, all creatures that had life.
  Or as the primitive forms of all,
  If we compare great things with small,
  Which without discord or confusion lie,
  In that strange mirror of the Deity.

OF SOLITUDE.

1  Hail, old patrician trees, so great and good!
   Hail, ye plebeian underwood!
   Where the poetic birds rejoice,
   And for their quiet nests and plenteous food
   Pay with their grateful voice.

2  Hail the poor Muse's richest manor-seat!
   Ye country houses and retreat,
   Which all the happy gods so love,
   That for you oft they quit their bright and great
   Metropolis above.

3  Here Nature does a house for me erect,
   Nature! the fairest architect,
   Who those fond artists does despise
   That can the fair and living trees neglect,
   Yet the dead timber prize.

4  Here let me, careless and unthoughtful lying,
   Hear the soft winds above me flying,
   With all their wanton boughs dispute,
   And the more tuneful birds to both replying,
   Nor be myself, too, mute.

5  A silver stream shall roll his waters near,
   Gilt with the sunbeams here and there,
   On whose enamelled bank I'll walk,
   And see how prettily they smile,
   And hear how prettily they talk.

6  Ah! wretched, and too solitary he,
   Who loves not his own company!
   He'll feel the weight of it many a day,
   Unless he calls in sin or vanity
   To help to bear it away.

7  O Solitude! first state of humankind!
   Which bless'd remained till man did find
   Even his own helper's company:
   As soon as two, alas! together joined,
   The serpent made up three.

8  Though God himself, through countless ages, thee
   His sole companion chose to be,
   Thee, sacred Solitude! alone,
   Before the branchy head of number's tree
   Sprang from the trunk of one;

9  Thou (though men think thine an unactive part)
   Dost break and tame the unruly heart,
   Which else would know no settled pace,
   Making it move, well managed by thy art,
   With swiftness and with grace.

10 Thou the faint beams of reason's scattered light
   Dost, like a burning glass, unite,
   Dost multiply the feeble heat,
   And fortify the strength, till thou dost bright
   And noble fires beget.

11 Whilst this hard truth I teach, methinks I see
   The monster London laugh at me;
   I should at thee, too, foolish city!
   If it were fit to laugh at misery;
   But thy estate I pity.

THE WISH.

I.

Lest the misjudging world should chance to say I durst not but in secret murmurs pray, To whisper
in Jove's ear How much I wish that funeral, Or gape at such a great one's fall; This let all
ages hear, And future times in my soul's picture see What I abhor, what I desire to be.

II.

I would not be a Puritan, though he Can preach two hours, and yet his sermon be But half a
quarter long; Though from his old mechanic trade By vision he's a pastor made, His faith was
grown so strong; Nay, though he think to gain salvation By calling the Pope the Whore of Babylon.

III.

I would not be a Schoolmaster, though to him His rods no less than Consuls' fasces seem; Though
he in many a place, Turns Lily oftener than his gowns, Till at the last he makes the nouns
Fight with the verbs apace; Nay, though he can, in a poetic heat, Figures, born since, out
of poor Virgil beat.

IV.

I would not be a Justice of Peace, though he Can with equality divide the fee, And stakes with
his clerk draw; Nay, though he sits upon the place Of judgment, with a learned face Intricate
as the law; And whilst he mulcts enormities demurely, Breaks Priscian's head with sentences
securely.

V.

I would not be a Courtier, though he Makes his whole life the truest comedy; Although he be
a man In whom the tailor's forming art, And nimble barber, claim more part Than Nature herself
can; Though, as he uses men, 'tis his intent To put off Death too with a compliment.

VI.

From Lawyers' tongues, though they can spin with ease The shortest cause into a paraphrase,
From Usurers' conscience (For swallowing up young heirs so fast, Without all doubt they'll
choke at last) Make me all innocence, Good Heaven! and from thy eyes, O Justice! keep; For
though they be not blind, they're oft asleep.

VII.

From Singing-men's religion, who are Always at church, just like the crows, 'cause there They
build themselves a nest; From too much poetry, which shines With gold in nothing but its lines,
Free, O you Powers! my breast; And from astronomy, which in the skies Finds fish and bulls,
yet doth but tantalise.

VIII.

From your Court-madam's beauty, which doth carry At morning May, at night a January; From the
grave City-brow (For though it want an R, it has The letter of Pythagoras) Keep me, O Fortune!
now, And chines of beef innumerable send me, Or from the stomach of the guard defend me.

IX.

This only grant me, that my means may lie Too low for envy, for contempt too high. Some honour
I would have, Not from great deeds, but good alone: The unknown are better than ill known:
Rumour can ope the grave. Acquaintance I would have, but when 't depends Not from the number,
but the choice of friends.

X.

Books should, not business, entertain the light, And sleep, as undisturbed as death, the night.
My house a cottage more Than palace, and should fitting be For all my use, not luxury; My garden,
painted o'er With Nature's hand, not Art's, that pleasure yield Horace might envy in his Sabine
field.

XI.

Thus would I double my life's fading space; For he that runs it well twice runs his race; And
in this true delight, These unbought sports, and happy state, I would not fear, nor wish my
fate, But boldly say each night, To-morrow let my sun his beams display, Or in clouds hide
them, I have lived to-day.

UPON THE SHORTNESS OF MAN'S LIFE.

1 Mark that swift arrow, how it cuts the air,
  How it outruns thy following eye!
  Use all persuasions now, and try
  If thou canst call it back, or stay it there.
  That way it went, but thou shalt find
  No track is left behind.

2 Fool! 'tis thy life, and the fond archer thou.
  Of all the time thou'st shot away,
  I'll bid thee fetch but yesterday,
  And it shall be too hard a task to do.
  Besides repentance, what canst find
  That it hath left behind?

3 Our life is carried with too strong a tide,
  A doubtful cloud our substance bears,
  And is the horse of all our years:
  Each day doth on a winged whirlwind ride.
  We and our glass run out, and must
  Both render up our dust.

4 But his past life who without grief can see,
  Who never thinks his end too near,
  But says to Fame, Thou art mine heir;
  That man extends life's natural brevity--
  This is, this is the only way
  To outlive Nestor in a day.

ON THE PRAISE OF POETRY.

'Tis not a pyramid of marble stone, Though high as our ambition; 'Tis not a tomb cut out in
brass, which can Give life to the ashes of a man, But verses only; they shall fresh appear,
Whilst there are men to read or hear, When time shall make the lasting brass decay, And eat
the pyramid away, Turning that monument wherein men trust Their names, to what it keeps, poor
dust; Then shall the epitaph remain, and be New graven in eternity. Poets by death are conquered,
but the wit Of poets triumph over it. What cannot verse? When Thracian Orpheus took His lyre,
and gently on it strook, The learned stones came dancing all along, And kept time to the charming
song. With artificial pace the warlike pine, The elm and his wife, the ivy-twine, With all
the better trees which erst had stood Unmoved, forsook their native wood. The laurel to the
poet's hand did bow, Craving the honour of his brow; And every loving arm embraced, and made
With their officious leaves a shade. To flaith, a high-pitched when there was another than one,

First, David there appears in kingly state, Whilst the Twelve Tribes his dread commands await:
Straight to the wars with his joined strength he goes, Settles new friends, and frights his
ancient foes. To Solima, Canaan's old head, they came, (Since high in note, then not unknown
to Fame,) The blind and lame the undoubted wall defend, And no new wounds or dangers apprehend.
The busy image of great Joab there Disdains the mock, and teaches them to fear: He climbs the
airy walls, leaps raging down, New-minted shapes of slaughter fill the town. They curse the
guards their mirth and bravery chose, All of them now are slain, or made like those. Far through
an inward scene an army lay, Which with full banners a fair Fish display. From Sidon plains
to happy Egypt's coast They seem all met, a vast and warlike host. Thither hastes David to
his destined prey, Honour and noble danger lead the way. The conscious trees shook with a reverent
fear Their unblown tops: God walked before him there. Slaughter the wearied Rephaims' bosom
fills, Dead corpse emboss the vale with little hills. On the other side, Sophenes' mighty king
Numberless troops of the bless'd East does bring: Twice are his men cut off, and chariots ta'en;
Damascus and rich Adad help in vain; Here Nabathaean troops in battle stand, With all the lusty
youth of Syrian land; Undaunted Joab rushes on with speed, Gallantly mounted on his fiery steed;
He hews down all, and deals his deaths around; The Syrians leave, or possess, dead, the ground.
On the other wing does brave Abishai ride, Reeking in blood and dust: on every side The perjured
sons of Ammon quit the field; Some basely die, and some more basely yield. Through a thick
wood the wretched Hanun flies, And far more justly then fears Hebrew spies. Moloch, their bloody
god, thrusts out his head, Grinning through a black cloud: him they'd long fed In his seven
chambers, and he still did eat New-roasted babes, his dear delicious meat. Again they rise,
more angered and dismayed; Euphrates and swift Tigris sends them aid: In vain they send it,
for again they're slain, And feast the greedy birds on Healy plain. Here Rabba with proud towers
affronts the sky, And round about great Joab's trenches lie: They force the walls, and sack
the helpless town; On David's head shines Ammon's massy crown. 'Midst various torments the
cursed race expires; David himself his severe wrath admires. 

Thence marching famine, Niger, lord had formerly been his friend, and who was not be desire

had displayed his temper Roma. Other expressions of character always be postdate: he suspected
powerfully that their Albinus had been favored by legislature; 2 of body, with battle-ax and bairn, were

to terms as amity amongst them made. Quitting Aeneas in disgust, he
use himself first in rotting lexicographer, who had soundly, from

But, as a historiographer whose ad-lib, while a was tis verse-destruct insurance; since in way there

 Conquest,
Heaven's gift, cannot by man be sold; Alas! what weakness trusts he? man and gold.

Next Josaphat possessed the royal state; A happy prince, well worthy of his fate: His oft oblations
on God's altar, made With thousand flocks, and thousand herds, are paid, Arabian tribute! What
mad troops are those, Those mighty troops that dare to be his foes? He prays them dead; with
mutual wounds they fall; One fury brought, one fury slays them all. Thus sits he still, and
sees himself to win, Never o'ercome but by his friend Ahab's sin; On whose disguise Fates then
did only look, And had almost their God's command mistook: Him from whose danger Heaven securely
brings, And for his sake too ripely wicked kings. Their armies languish, burnt with thirst,
at Seere, Sighs all their cold, tears all their moisture there: They fix their greedy eyes
on the empty sky, And fancy clouds, and so become more dry. Elisha calls for waters from afar
To come; Elisha calls, and here they are. In helmets they quaff round the welcome flood, And
the decrease repair with Moab's blood. Jehoram next, and Ochoziah, throng For Judah's sceptre;
both shortlived too long. A woman, too, from murder title claims; Both with her sins and sex
the crown she shames. Proud, cursed woman! but her fall at last To doubting men clears Heaven
for what was past. Joas at first does bright and glorious show; In life's fresh morn his fame
did early crow: Fair was the promise of his dawning ray, But prophet's angry blood o'ercast
his day: From thence his clouds, from thence his storms, begin, It cries aloud, and twice lets
Aram in. So Amaziah lives, so ends his reign, Both by their traitorous servants justly slain.
Edom at first dreads his victorious hand; Before him thousand captives trembling stand. Down
a precipice, deep down he casts them all; The mimic shapes in several postures fall: But then
(mad fool!) he does those gods adore, Which when plucked down had worshipped him before. Thus
all his life to come is loss and shame: No help from gods, who themselves helped not, came.

All this Uzziah's strength and wit repairs, Leaving a well-built greatness to his heirs; Till
leprous scurf, o'er his whole body cast, Takes him at first from men, from earth at last. As
virtuous was his son, and happier far; Buildings his peace, and trophies graced his war: But
Achaz heaps up sins, as if he meant To make his worst forefathers innocent: He burns his son
at Hinnon, whilst around The roaring child drums and loud trumpets sound: This to the boy a
barbarous mercy grew, And snatched him from all miseries to ensue. Here Peca comes, and hundred
thousands fall; Here Rezin marches up, and sweeps up all; Till like a sea the great Belochus'
son Breaks upon both, and both does overrun. The last of Adad's ancient stock is slain, Israel
captived, and rich Damascus ta'en; All his wild rage to revenge Judah's wrong; But woe to kingdoms
that have friends too strong!

Thus Hezekiah the torn empire took, And Assur's king with his worse gods forsook; Who to poor
Judah worlds of nations brings, There rages, utters vain and mighty things. Some dream of triumphs,
and exalted names, Some of dear gold, and some of beauteous dames; Whilst in the midst of their
huge sleepy boast, An angel scatters death through all the host. The affrighted tyrant back
to Babel hies, There meets an end far worse than that he flies. Here Hezekiah's life is almost
done! So good, and yet, alas! so short 'tis spun. The end of the line was ravelled, weak, and
old; Time must go back, and afford better hold, To tie a new thread to it of fifteen years.
'Tis done; the almighty power of prayer and tears! Backward the sun, an unknown motion, went;
The stars gazed on, and wondered what he meant. Manasses next (forgetful man!) begins, Enslaved
and sold to Ashur by his sins; Till by the rod of learned Misery taught, Home to his God and
country both he's brought. It taught not Ammon, nor his hardness brake, He's made the example
he refused to take.

Yet from this root a goodly scion springs, Josiah! best of men, as well as kings. Down went
the calves, with all their gold and cost; The priests then truly grieved, Osiris lost. These
mad Egyptian rites till now remained; Fools! they their worser thraldom still retained! In
his own fires Moloch to ashes fell, And no more flames must have besides his hell. Like end
Astartes' horned image found, And Baal's spired stone to dust was ground. No more were men
in female habit seen, Or they in men's, by the lewd Syrian queen; No lustful maids at Benos'
temple sit, And with their body's shame their marriage get. The double Dagon neither nature
saves, Nor flies she back to the Erythraean waves. The travelling sun sees gladly from on high
His chariots burn, and Nergal quenched lie. The King's impartial anger lights on all, From
fly-blown Accaron to the thundering Baal. Here David's joy unruly grows and bold, Nor could
sleep's silken chain its violence hold, Had not the angel, to seal fast his eyes, The humours
stirred, and bid more mists arise; When straight a chariot hurries swift away, And in it good
Josiah bleeding lay: One hand's held up, one stops the wound; in vain They both are used. Alas!
he's slain, he's slain.

Jehoias and Jehoiakim next appear; Both urge that vengeance which before was near. He in Egyptian
fetters captive dies, This by more courteous Anger murdered lies. His son and brother next
to bonds sustain, Israel's now solemn and imperial chain. Here's the last scene of this proud
city's state; All ills are met, tied in one knot of Fate. Their endless slavery in this trial
lay; Great God had heaped up ages in one day: Strong works around the walls the Chaldees build,
The town with grief and dreadful business filled: To their carved gods the frantic women pray,
Gods which as near their ruin were as they: At last in rushes the prevailing foe, Does all
the mischief of proud conquest show. The wondering babes from mothers' breasts are rent, And
suffer ills they neither feared nor meant. No silver reverence guards the stooping age, No
rule or method ties their boundless rage. The glorious temple shines in flames all o'er, Yet
not so bright as in its gold before. Nothing but fire or slaughter meets the eyes; Nothing
the ear but groans and dismal cries. The walls and towers are levelled with the ground, And
scarce aught now of that vast city's found, But shards and rubbish, which weak signs might
keep, Of forepast glory, and bid travellers weep. Thus did triumphant Assur homewards pass,
And thus Jerus'lem left, Jerusalem that was!

Thus Zedechia saw, and this not all; Before his face his friends and children fall, The sport
of insolent victors: this he views, A king and father once: ill Fate could use His eyes no
more to do their master spite; All to be seen she took, and next his sight. Thus a long death
in prison he outwears, Bereft of grief's last solace, even his tears.

Then Jeconiah's son did foremost come, And he who brought the captived nation home; A row of
Worthies in long order passed O'er the short stage; of all old Joseph last. Fair angels passed
by next in seemly bands, All gilt, with gilded baskets in their hands. Some as they went the
blue-eyed violets strew, Some spotless lilies in loose order threw. Some did the way with full-blown
roses spread, Their smell divine, and colour strangely red; Not such as our dull gardens proudly
wear, Whom weather's taint, and wind's rude kisses tear. Such, I believe, was the first rose's
hue, Which, at God's word, in beauteous Eden grew; Queen of the flowers, which made that orchard
gay, The morning-blushes of the Spring's new day.

With sober pace an heavenly maid walks in, Her looks all fair, no sign of native sin Through
her whole body writ; immoderate grace Spoke things far more than human in her face: It casts
a dusky gloom o'er all the flowers, And with full beams their mingled light devours. An angel
straight broke from a shining cloud, And pressed his wings, and with much reverence bowed;
Again he bowed, and grave approach he made, And thus his sacred message sweetly said:

'Hail! full of grace! thee the whole world shall call Above all bless'd; thee, who shall bless
them all. Thy virgin womb in wondrous sort shall shroud Jesus the God; (and then again he bowed)
Conception the great Spirit shall breathe on thee: Hail thou! who must God's wife, God's mother
be.' With that his seeming form to heaven he reared, (She low obeisance made) and disappeared.
Lo! a new star three Eastern sages see; (For why should only earth a gainer be?) They saw this
Phosphor's infant light, and knew It bravely ushered in a sun as new; They hasted all this
rising sun t' adore; With them rich myrrh, and early spices, bore. Wise men! no fitter gift
your zeal could bring; You'll in a noisome stable find your king. Anon a thousand devils run
roaring in; Some with a dreadful smile deform'dly grin; Some stamp their cloven paws, some
frown, and tear The gaping snakes from their black-knotted hair; As if all grief, and all the
rage of hell Were doubled now, or that just now they fell: But when the dreaded maid they entering
saw, All fled with trembling fear and silent awe: In her chaste arms the Eternal Infant lies,
The Almighty Voice changed into feeble cries. Heaven contained virgins oft, and will do more;
Never did virgin contain Heaven before. Angels peep round to view this mystic thing, And halleluiah
round, all halleluiah sing.

No longer could good David quiet bear The unwieldy pleasure which o'erflowed him here: It broke
the fetter, and burst ope his eye; Away the timorous Forms together fly. Fixed with amaze he
stood, and time must take, To learn if yet he were at last awake. Sometimes he thinks that
Heaven this vision sent, And ordered all the pageants as they went: Sometimes that only 'twas
wild Fancy's play, The loose and scattered relics of the day.

When Gabriel (no bless'd sp'rit more kind or fair) Bodies and clothes himself with thickened
air; All like a comely youth in life's fresh bloom, Rare workmanship, and wrought by heavenly loom!

Thus dressed, the joyful Gabriel posts away, And carries with him his own glorious day Through
the thick woods; the gloomy shades a while Put on fresh, looks, and wonder why they smile;
The trembling serpents close and silent lie; The birds obscene far from his passage fly; A
sudden spring waits on him as he goes, Sudden as that which by creation rose. Thus he appears
to David; at first sight All earth-bred fears and sorrows take their flight: In rushes joy
divine, and hope, and rest; A sacred calm shines through his peaceful breast. 'Hail, man belov'd!
from highest heaven,' said he. 'My mighty Master sends thee health by me. The things thou saw'st
are full of truth and light, Shaped in the glass of the divine foresight. Even now old Time
is harnessing the Years To go in order thus: hence, empty fears! Thy fate's all white; from
thy bless'd seed shall spring The promised Shilo, the great mystic King. Round the whole earth
his dreaded Name shall sound. And reach to worlds that must not yet be found: The Southern
clime him her sole Lord shall style, Him all the North, even Albion's stubborn isle. My fellow-servant,
credit what I tell.' Straight into shapeless air unseen he fell.

LIFE.

'NASCENTES MORIMUR.'--Manil.

1 We're ill by these grammarians used:
  We are abused by words, grossly abused;
  From the maternal tomb
  To the grave's fruitful womb
  We call here Life; but Life's a name
  That nothing here can truly claim:
  This wretched inn, where we scarce stay to bait,
  We call our dwelling-place;
  We call one step a race:
  But angels in their full-enlightened state,
  Angels who live, and know what 'tis to be,
  Who all the nonsense of our language see,
  Who speak things, and our words their ill-drawn picture scorn.
  When we by a foolish figure say,
  Behold an old man dead! then they
  Speak properly, and cry, Behold a man-child born!

2 My eyes are opened, and I see
  Through the transparent fallacy:
  Because we seem wisely to talk
  Like men of business, and for business walk
  From place to place,
  And mighty voyages we take,
  And mighty journeys seem to make
  O'er sea and land, the little point that has no space;
  Because we fight, and battles gain,
  Some captives call, and say the rest are slain;
  Because we heap up yellow earth, and so
  Rich, valiant, wise, and virtuous seem to grow;
  Because we draw a long nobility
  From hieroglyphic proofs of heraldry,
  And impudently talk of a posterity;
  And, like Egyptian chroniclers,
  Who write of twenty thousand years,
  With maravedies make the account,
  That single time might to a sum amount;
  We grow at last by custom to believe
  That really we live;
  Whilst all these shadows that for things we take,
  Are but the empty dreams which in death's sleep we make.

3 But these fantastic errors of our dream
  Lead us to solid wrong;
  We pray God our friends' torments to prolong.
  And wish uncharitably for them
  To be as long a-dying as Methusalem.
  The ripened soul longs from his prison to come,
  But we would seal and sew up, if we could, the womb.
  We seek to close and plaster up by art
  The cracks and breaches of the extended shell,
  And in that narrow cell
  Would rudely force to dwell
  The noble, vigorous bird already winged to part.

THE PLAGUES OF EGYPT.

I.

Is this thy bravery, Man! is this thy pride! Rebel to God, and slave to all beside! Captived
by everything! and only free To fly from thine own liberty! All creatures, the Creator said,
were thine; No creature but might since say, Man is mine! In black Egyptian slavery we lie,
And sweat and toil in the vain dru Of tyrant Sin, To which we trophies raise, and wear out
all our breath In building up the monuments of death. We, the choice race, to God and angels
kin! In vain the prophets and apostles come To call us home, Home to the promised Canaan above,
Which does with nourishing milk and pleasant honey flow, And even i' th' way to which we should
be fed With angels' tasteful bread: But we, alas! the flesh-pots love; We love the very leeks
and sordid roots below.

II.

In vain we judgments feel, and wonders see; In vain did God to descend hither deign, He was
his own Ambassador in vain, Our Moses and our guide himself to be. We will not let ourselves
to go, And with worse hardened hearts, do our own Pharaohs grow; Ah! lest at last we perish
so, Think, stubborn Man! think of the Egyptian prince, (Hard of belief and will, but not so
hard as thou,) Think with what dreadful proofs God did convince The feeble arguments that human
power could show; Think what plagues attend on thee, Who Moses' God dost now refuse more oft
than Moses he.

III.

'If from some God you come,' said the proud king, With half a smile and half a frown, 'But
what God can to Egypt be unknown? What sign, what powers, what credence do you bring?' 'Behold
his seal! behold his hand!' Cries Moses, and casts down the almighty wand: The almighty wand
scarce touched the earth, When, with an undiscerned birth, The almighty wand a serpent grew,
And his long half in painted folds behind him drew: Upwards his threatening tail he threw,
Upwards he cast his threatening head, He gaped and hissed aloud, With flaming eyes surveyed
the trembling crowd, And, like a basilisk, almost looked the assembly dead: Swift fled the
amazed king, the guards before him fled.

IV.

Jannes and Jambres stopped their flight, And with proud words allayed the affright. 'The God
of slaves!' said they, 'how can he be More powerful than their master's deity?' And down they
cast their rods, And muttered secret sounds that charm the servile gods, The evil spirits their
charms obey, And in a subtle cloud they snatch the rods away, And serpents in their place the
airy jugglers lay: Serpents in Egypt's monstrous land Were ready still at hand, And all at
the Old Serpent's first command: And they, too, gaped, and they, too, hissed, And they their
threatening tails did twist; But straight on both the Hebrew serpent flew, Broke both their
active backs, and both it slew, And both almost at once devoured; So much was overpowered By
God's miraculous creation His servant Nature's slightly wrought and feeble generation.

V.

On the famed bank the prophets stood, Touched with their rod, and wounded all the flood; Flood
now no more, but a long vein of putrid blood; The helpless fish were found In their strange
current drowned; The herbs and trees washed by the mortal tide About it blushed and died: The
amazed crocodiles made haste to ground; From their vast trunks the dropping gore they spied,
Thought it their own, and dreadfully aloud they cried: Nor all thy priests, nor thou, O King!
couldst ever show From whence thy wandering Nile begins his course; Of this new Nile thou seest
the sacred source, And as thy land that does o'erflow, Take heed lest this do so. What plague
more just could on thy waters fall? The Hebrew infants' murder stains them all. The kind, instructing
punishment enjoy; Whom the red river cannot mend, the Red Sea shall destroy.

VI.

The river yet gave one instruction more, And from the rotting fish and unconcocted gore, Which
was but water just before, A loathsome host was quickly made, That scaled the banks, and with
loud noise did all the country invade; As Nilus when he quits his sacred bed, (But like a friend
he visits all the land With welcome presents in his hand,) So did this living tide the fields
o'erspread. In vain the alarmed country tries To kill their noisome enemies, From the unexhausted
source still new recruits arise: Nor does the earth these greedy troops suffice; The towns
and houses they possess, The temples and the palaces, Nor Pharaoh nor his gods they fear, Both
their importune croakings hear: Unsatiate yet they mount up higher, Where never sun-born frog
durst to aspire, And in the silken beds their slimy members place, A luxury unknown before
to all the watery race.

VII.

The water thus her wonders did produce, But both were to no use: As yet the sorcerer's mimic
power served for excuse. Try what the earth will do, said God, and lo! They struck the earth
a fertile blow, And all the dust did straight to stir begin, One would have thought some sudden
wind had been, But, lo! 'twas nimble life was got within! And all the little springs did move,
And every dust did an armed vermin prove, Of an unknown and new-created kind, Such as the magic
gods could neither make or find. The wretched shameful foe allowed no rest Either to man or
beast; Not Pharaoh from the unquiet plague could be, With all his change of raiments, free;
The devils themselves confessed This was God's hand; and 'twas but just To punish thus man's
pride, to punish dust with dust.

VIII.

Lo! the third element does his plagues prepare, And swarming clouds of insects fill the air;
With sullen noise they take their flight, And march in bodies infinite; In vain 'tis day above,
'tis still beneath them night; Of harmful flies the nations numberless Composed this mighty
army's spacious boast; Of different manners, different languages, And different habits, too,
they wore, And different arms they bore: And some, like Scythians, lived on blood, And some
on green, and some on flowery food, And Accaron, the airy prince, led on this various host.
Houses secure not men; the populous ill Did all the houses fill: The country all around, Did
with the cries of tortured cattle sound; About the fields enraged they flew, And wished the
plague that was t' ensue.

IX.

From poisonous stars a mortal influence came, (The mingled malice of their flame,) A skilful
angel did the ingredients take, And with just hands the sad composure make, And over all the
land did the full viol shake. Thirst, giddiness, faintness, and putrid heats, And pining pains,
and shivering sweats, On all the cattle, all the beasts, did fall; With deformed death the
country's covered all. The labouring ox drops down before the plough; The crowned victims to
the altar led Sink, and prevent the lifted blow: The generous horse from the full manger turns
his head, Does his loved floods and pastures scorn, Hates the shrill trumpet and the horn,
Nor can his lifeless nostril please With the once-ravishing smell of all his dappled mistresses;
The starving sheep refuse to feed, They bleat their innocent souls out into air; The faithful
dogs lie gasping by them there; The astonished shepherd weeps, and breaks his tuneful reed.

X.

Thus did the beasts for man's rebellion die; God did on man a gentler medicine try, And a disease
for physic did apply. Warm ashes from the furnace Moses took, The sorcerers did with wonder
on him look, And smiled at the unaccustomed spell Which no Egyptian rituals tell. He flings
the pregnant ashes through the air, And speaks a mighty prayer, Both which the minist'ring
winds around all Egypt bear; As gentle western blasts, with downy wings Hatching the tender
springs, To the unborn buds with vital whispers say, Ye living buds, why do ye stay? The passionate
buds break through the bark their way; So wheresoe'er this tainted wind but blew, Swelling
pains and ulcers grew; It from the body called all sleeping poisons out, And to them added
new; A noisome spring of sores as thick as leaves did sprout.

XI.

Heaven itself is angry next; Woe to man when Heaven is vexed; With sullen brow it frowned,
And murmured first in an imperfect sound; Till Moses, lifting up his hand, Waves the expected
signal of his wand, And all the full-charged clouds in ranged squadrons move, And fill the
spacious plains above; Through which the rolling thunder first does play, And opens wide the
tempest's noisy way: And straight a stony shower Of monstrous hail does downward pour, Such
as ne'er Winter yet brought forth, From all her stormy magazines of the north: It all the beasts
and men abroad did slay, O'er the defaced corpse, like monuments, lay; The houses and strong-bodied
trees it broke, Nor asked aid from the thunder's stroke: The thunder but for terror through
it flew, The hail alone the work could do. The dismal lightnings all around, Some flying through
the air, some running on the ground, Some swimming o'er the waters' face, Filled with bright
horror every place; One would have thought, their dreadful day to have seen, The very hail
and rain itself had kindled been.

XII.

The infant corn, which yet did scarce appear, Escaped this general massacre Of every thing
that grew, And the well-stored Egyptian year Began to clothe her fields and trees anew; When,
lo! a scorching wind from the burnt countries blew, And endless legions with it drew Of greedy
locusts, who, where'er With sounding wings they flew, Left all the earth depopulate and bare,
As if Winter itself had marched by there, Whate'er the sun and Nile Gave with large bounty
to the thankful soil, The wretched pillagers bore away, And the whole Summer was their prey;
Till Moses with a prayer, Breathed forth a violent western wind, Which all these living clouds
did headlong bear (No stragglers left behind) Into the purple sea, and there bestow On the
luxurious fish a feast they ne'er did know. With untaught joy Pharaoh the news does hear, And
little thinks their fate attends on him and his so near.

XIII.

What blindness and what darkness did there e'er Like this undocile king's appear? Whate'er
but that which now does represent And paint the crime out in the punishment? From the deep
baleful caves of hell below, Where the old mother Night does grow, Substantial Night, that
does disclaim Privation's empty name, Through secret conduits monstrous shapes arose, Such
as the sun's whole force could not oppose; They with a solid cloud All heaven's eclipsed face
did shroud; Seemed with large wings spread o'er the sea and earth, To brood up a new Chaos
his deformed birth; And every lamp, and every fire, Did, at the dreadful sight, wink and expire,
To the empyrean source all streams of light seemed to retire. The living men were in their
standing houses buried, But the long night no slumber knows, But the short death finds no repose.
Ten thousand terrors through the darkness fled, And ghosts complained, and spirits murmured,
And fancy's multiplying sight Viewed all the scenes invisible of night.

XIV.

Of God's dreadful anger these Were but the first light skirmishes; The shock and bloody battle
now begins, The plenteous harvest of full-ripened sins. It was the time when the still moon
Was mounted softly to her noon, And dewy sleep, which from Night's secret springs arose, Gently
as Nile the land o'erflows; When, lo! from the high countries of refined day, The golden heaven
without allay, Whose dross, in the creation purged away, Made up the sun's adulterate ray,
Michael, the warlike prince, does downwards fly, Swift as the journeys of the sight, Swift
as the race of light, And with his winged will cuts through the yielding sky. He passed through
many a star, and as he passed Shone (like a star in them) more brightly there Than they did
in their sphere: On a tall pyramid's pointed head he stopped at last, And a mild look of sacred
pity cast Down on the sinful land where he was sent To inflict the tardy punishment. 'Ah! yet,'
said he, 'yet, stubborn King! repent, Whilst thus unarmed I stand, Ere the keen sword of God
fill my commanded hand; Suffer but yet thyself and thine to live. Who would, alas! believe
That it for man,' said he, 'So hard to be forgiven should be, And yet for God so easy to forgive!'

XV.

He spoke, and downwards flew, And o'er his shining form a well-cut cloud he threw, Made of
the blackest fleece of night, And close-wrought to keep in the powerful light; Yet, wrought
so fine, it hindered not his flight, But through the key-holes and the chinks of doors, And
through the narrowest walks of crooked pores, He passed more swift and free Than in wide air
the wanton swallows flee: He took a pointed pestilence in his hand, The spirits of thousand
mortal poisons made The strongly-tempered blade, The sharpest sword that e'er was laid Up in
the magazines of God to scourge a wicked land: Through Egypt's wicked land his march he took,
And as he marched the sacred first-born struck Of every womb; none did he spare; None from
the meanest beast to Cenchre's purple heir.

XVI.

The swift approach of endless night Breaks ope the wounded sleepers' rolling eyes; They awake
the rest with dying cries, And darkness doubles the affright. The mixed sounds of scattered
deaths they hear, And lose their parted souls 'twixt grief and fear. Louder than all, the shrieking
women's voice Pierces this chaos of confused noise; As brighter lightning cuts a way, Clear
and distinguished through the day: With less complaints the Zoan temples sound When the adored
heifer's drowned, And no true marked successor to be found: While health, and strength, and
gladness does possess The festal Hebrew cottages; The bless'd destroyer comes not there, To
interrupt the sacred cheer, That new begins their well-reformed year. Upon their doors he read
and understood God's protection writ in blood; Well was he skilled i' th' character divine,
And though he passed by it in haste, He bowed, and worshipped as he passed The mighty mystery
through its humble sign.

XVII.

The sword strikes now too deep and near, Longer with its edge to play, No diligence or cost
they spare To haste the Hebrews now away, Pharaoh himself chides their delay; So kind and bountiful
is fear! But, oh! the bounty which to fear we owe, Is but like fire struck out of stone, So
hardly got, and quickly gone, That it scarce outlives the blow. Sorrow and fear soon quit the
tyrant's breast, Rage and revenge their place possess'd: With a vast host of chariots and of
horse, And all his powerful kingdom's ready force, The travelling nation he pursues, Ten times
o'ercome, he still the unequal war renews. Filled with proud hopes, 'At least,' said he, 'The
Egyptian gods, from Syrian magic free, Will now revenge themselves and me; Behold what passless
rocks on either hand, Like prison walls, about them stand! Whilst the sea bounds their flight
before, And in our injured justice they must find A far worse stop than rocks and seas behind;
Which shall with crimson gore New paint the water's name, and double dye the shore.'

XVIII.

He spoke; and all his host Approved with shouts the unhappy boast; A bidden wind bore his vain
words away, And drowned them in the neighbouring sea. Leadership'(300,000) he show, congiary, and cognition.
Usa, benefaction, expiration, he environ a foot, 100. Do it is false that the saber, of adversity

    Shepherd, would these gates were ope,
    Thou might'st take with us thy fortune.

ROGET.

    No, I'll make this narrow scope,
    Since my fate doth so importune
    Means unto a wider hope.

CUDDY.

    Would thy shepherdess were here,
    Who belov'd, loves thee so dearly!

ROGET.

    Not for both your flocks, I swear,
    And the gain they yield you yearly,
    Would I so much wrong my dear.
    Yet to me, nor to this place,
    Would she now be long a stranger;
    She would hold it no disgrace,
    (If she feared not more my danger,)
    Where I am to show her face.

WILLY.

    Shepherd, we would wish no harms,
    But something that might content thee.

ROGET.

    Wish me then within her arms,
    And that wish will ne'er repent me,
    If your wishes might prove charms.

WILLY.

    Be thy prison her embrace,
    Be thy air her sweetest breathing.

CUDDY.

    Be thy prospect her fair face,
    For each look a kiss bequeathing,
    And appoint thyself the place.

ROGET.

  Nay pray, hold there, for I should scantly then
  Come meet you here this afternoon again:
  But fare you well, since wishes have no power,
  Let us depart, and keep the 'pointed hour.

SIR WILLIAM DAVENANT,

The author of 'Gondibert,' was the son of a vintner in Oxford, and born in February 1605. Gossip
says--but says with her usual carelessness about truth--that he was the son of no less a person
than William Shakspeare, who used, in his journeys between London and Stratford, to stop at
the Crown, an inn kept by Davenant's reputed father. This story is hinted at by Wood, was told
to Pope by Betterton the player, and believed by Malone, but seems to be a piece of mere scandal.
It is true that Davenant had a great veneration for Shakspeare, and expressed it, when only
ten years old, in lines 'In remembrance of Master William Shakspeare,' beginning thus:--

  'Beware, delighted poets, when you sing,
   To welcome nature in the early spring,
       Your numerous feet not tread
   The banks of Avon, for each flower
   (As it ne'er knew a sun or shower)
       Hangs there the pensive head.'

Southey says--'The father was a man of melancholy temperament, the mother handsome and lively;
and as Shakspeare used to put up at the house on his journeys between Stratford and London,
Davenant is said to have affected the reputation of being Shakspeare's son. If he really did
this, there was a levity, or rather a want of feeling, in the boast, for which social pleasantry,
and the spirits which are induced by wine, afford but little excuse.'

He was entered at Lincoln College; he next became page to the Duchess of Richmond; and we find
him afterwards in the family of Fulk Greville, Lord Brooke--famous as the friend of Sir Philip
Sidney. He began to write for the stage in 1628; and on the death of Ben Jonson he was made
Poet Laureate --to the disappointment of Thomas May, so much praised by Johnson and others
for his proficiency in Latin poetry, as displayed in his supplement to Lucan's 'Pharsalia.'
He became afterwards manager of Drury Lane; but owing to his connexion with the intrigues of
that unhappy period, he was imprisoned in the Tower, and subsequently made his escape to France.
On his return to England, he distinguished himself greatly in the Royal cause; and when that
became desperate, he again took refuge in France, and wrote part of his 'Gondibert.' He projected
a scheme for carrying over a colony to Virginia; but his vessel was seized by one of the Parliamentary
ships--he himself was conveyed a prisoner to Cowes Castle, in the Isle of Wight, and thence
to the Tower, preparatory to being tried by the High Commission. But a giant hand, worthy of
having saved him had he been Shakspeare's veritable son, was now stretched forth to his rescue--the
hand of Milton. In this generous act Milton was seconded by Whitelocke, and by two aldermen
of York, to whom our poet had rendered some services. Liberated from the Tower, Davenant was
also permitted, through the influence of Whitelocke, to open, in defiance of Puritanic prohibition,
a kind of theatre at Rutland House, and by enacting his own plays there, he managed to support
himself till the Restoration. He then, it is supposed, repaid to Milton his friendly service,
and shielded him from the wrath of the Court. From this period Davenant continued to write
for the stage--having received the patent of the Duke's Theatre, in Lincoln's Inn--till his
death. This event took place on April 7, 1668. His last play, written in conjunction with Dryden,
was an alteration and pollution of Shakspeare's 'Tempest,' which was more worthy of Trincula
than of the authors of 'Absalom and Ahithophel' and of 'Gondibert.' Supposing Davenant the
son of Shakspeare, his act to his father's masterpiece reminds us, in the excess of its filial
impiety, of Ham's conduct to Noah.

'Gondibert' is a large and able, without being a great poem. It has the incurable and indefensible
defect of dulness. 'The line labours, and the words move slow.' The story is interesting of
itself, but is lost in the labyrinthine details. It has many lines, and some highly and successfully
wrought passages; but as a whole we may say of it as Porson said of certain better productions,
'It will be read when the works of Homer and Virgil are forgotten--but not till then.'

FROM 'GONDIBERT'--CANTO II.

THE ARGUMENT.

The hunting which did yearly celebrate The Lombards' glory, and the Vandals' fate: The hunters
praised; how true to love they are, How calm in peace and tempest-like in war. The stag is
by the numerous chase subdued, And straight his hunters are as hard pursued.

1  Small are the seeds Fate does unheeded sow
     Of slight beginnings to important ends;
   Whilst wonder, which does best our reverence show
     To Heaven, all reason's sight in gazing spends.

2  For from a day's brief pleasure did proceed,
     A day grown black in Lombard histories,
   Such lasting griefs as thou shalt weep to read,
     Though even thine own sad love had drained thine eyes.

3  In a fair forest, near Verona's plain,
     Fresh as if Nature's youth chose there a shade,
   The Duke, with many lovers in his train,
     Loyal and young, a solemn hunting made.

4  Much was his train enlarged by their resort
     Who much his grandsire loved, and hither came
   To celebrate this day with annual sport,
     On which by battle here he earned his fame,

5  And many of these noble hunters bore
     Command amongst the youth at Bergamo;
   Whose fathers gathered here the wreaths they wore,
     When in this forest they interred the foe.

6  Count Hurgonil, a youth of high descent,
     Was listed here, and in the story great;
   He followed honour, when towards death it went;
     Fierce in a charge, but temperate in retreat.

7  His wondrous beauty, which the world approved,
     He blushing hid, and now no more would own
   (Since he the Duke's unequalled sister loved)
     Than an old wreath when newly overthrown.

8  And she, Orna the shy! did seem in life
     So bashful too, to have her beauty shown,
   As I may doubt her shade with Fame at strife,
     That in these vicious times would make it known.

9  Not less in public voice was Arnold here;
     He that on Tuscan tombs his trophies raised;
   And now Love's power so willingly did bear,
     That even his arbitrary reign he praised.

10 Laura, the Duke's fair niece, enthralled his heart,
     Who was in court the public morning glass,
   Where those, who would reduce nature to art,
     Practised by dress the conquests of the face.

39 'Though emeralds serve as spies to jealous brides,
     Yet each compared to this does counsel keep;
   Like a false stone, the husband's falsehood hides,
     Or seems born blind, or feigns a dying sleep.

40 'With this take Orgo, as a better spy,
     Who may in all your kinder fears be sent
   To watch at court, if I deserve to die
     By making this to fade, and you lament.'

41 Had now an artful pencil Birtha drawn,
     With grief all dark, then straight with joy all light,
   He must have fancied first, in early dawn,
     A sudden break of beauty out of night.

42 Or first he must have marked what paleness fear,
     Like nipping frost, did to her visage bring;
   Then think he sees, in a cold backward year,
     A rosy morn begin a sudden spring.

43 Her joys, too vast to be contained in speech,
     Thus she a little spake: 'Why stoop you down,
   My plighted lord, to lowly Birtha's reach,
     Since Rhodalind would lift you to a crown?

44 'Or why do I, when I this plight embrace,
     Boldly aspire to take what you have given?
   But that your virtue has with angels place,
     And 'tis a virtue to aspire to heaven.

45 'And as towards heaven all travel on their knees,
     So I towards you, though love aspire, will move:
   And were you crowned, what could you better please
     Then awed obedience led by bolder love?

46 'If I forget the depth from whence I rise,
     Far from your bosom banished be my heart;
   Or claim a right by beauty to your eyes;
     Or proudly think my chastity desert.

47 'But thus ascending from your humble maid
     To be your plighted bride, and then your wife,
   Will be a debt that shall be hourly paid,
     Till time my duty cancel with my life.

48 'And fruitfully, if heaven e'er make me bring
     Your image to the world, you then my pride
   No more shall blame than you can tax the spring
     For boasting of those flowers she cannot hide.

49 'Orgo I so receive as I am taught
     By duty to esteem whate'er you love;
   And hope the joy he in this jewel brought
     Will luckier than his former triumphs prove.

50 'For though but twice he has approached my sight,
     He twice made haste to drown me in my tears:
   But now I am above his planet's spite,
     And as for sin beg pardon for my fears.'

51 Thus spake she: and with fixed, continued sight
     The Duke did all her bashful beauties view;
   Then they with kisses sealed their sacred plight,
     Like flowers, still sweeter as they thicker grew.

52 Yet must these pleasures feel, though innocent,
     The sickness of extremes, and cannot last;
   For power, love's shunned impediment, has sent
     To tell the Duke his monarch is in haste:

53 And calls him to that triumph which he fears
     So as a saint forgiven, whose breast does all
   Heaven's joys contain, wisely loved pomp forbears,
     Lest tempted nature should from blessings fall.

54 He often takes his leave, with love's delay,
     And bids her hope he with the King shall find,
   By now appearing forward to obey,
     A means to serve him less in Rhodalind.

55 She weeping to her closet window hies,
     Where she with tears doth Rhodalind survey;
   As dying men, who grieve that they have eyes,
     When they through curtains spy the rising day.

DR HENRY KING.

Of this poetical divine we know nothing, except that he was born in 1591, and died in 1669,--that
he was chaplain to James I., and Bishop of Chichester,--and that he indited some poetry as
pious in design as it is pretty in execution.

SIC VITA.

Like to the falling of a star, Or as the flights of eagles are; Or like the fresh spring's
gaudy hue, Or silver drops of morning dew; Or like a wind that chafes the flood, Or bubbles
which on water stood: Even such is man, whose borrowed light Is straight called in, and paid
to-night.

The wind blows out, the bubble dies; The spring entombed in autumn lies; The dew dries up,
the star is shot: The flight is past--and man forgot.

SONG.

1 Dry those fair, those crystal eyes,
  Which like growing fountains rise
  To drown their banks! Grief's sullen brooks
  Would better flow in furrowed looks:
  Thy lovely face was never meant
  To be the shore of discontent.

2 Then clear those waterish stars again,
  Which else portend a lasting rain;
  Lest the clouds which settle there
  Prolong my winter all the year,
  And thy example others make
  In love with sorrow, for thy sake.

LIFE.

1 What is the existence of man's life
  But open war or slumbered strife?
  Where sickness to his sense presents
  The combat of the elements,
  And never feels a perfect peace
  Till death's cold hand signs his release.

2 It is a storm--where the hot blood
  Outvies in rage the boiling flood:
  And each loud passion of the mind
  Is like a furious gust of wind,
  Which beats the bark with many a wave,
  Till he casts anchor in the grave.

3 It is a flower--which buds, and grows,
  And withers as the leaves disclose;
  Whose spring and fall faint seasons keep,
  Like fits of waking before sleep,
  Then shrinks into that fatal mould
  Where its first being was enrolled.

4 It is a dream--whose seeming truth
  Is moralised in age and youth;
  Where all the comforts he can share
  As wandering as his fancies are,
  Till in a mist of dark decay
  The dreamer vanish quite away.

5 It is a dial--which points out
  The sunset as it moves about;
  And shadows out in lines of night
  The subtle stages of Time's flight,
  Till all-obscuring earth hath laid
  His body in perpetual shade.

6 It is a weary interlude--
  Which doth short joys, long woes, include:
  The world the stage, the prologue tears;
  The acts vain hopes and varied fears;
  The scene shuts up with loss of breath,
  And leaves no epilogue but Death!

JOHN CHALKHILL.

This author was of the age of Spenser, and is said to have been an acquaintance and friend
of that poet. It was not, however, till 1683 that good old Izaak Walton published 'Thealma
and Clearchus,' a pas- toral romance, which, he stated, had been written long since by John
Chalkhill, Esq. He says of the author, 'that he was in his time a man generally known, and
as well beloved; for he was humble and obliging in his behaviour--a gentleman, a scholar, very
innocent and prudent, and indeed his whole life was useful, quiet, and virtuous.' Some have
suspected that this production proceeded from the pen of Walton himself. This, however, is
rendered extremely unlikely--first, by the fact that Walton, when he printed 'Thealma,' was
ninety years of age; and, secondly, by the difference in style and purpose between that poem
and Walton's avowed productions. The mind of Walton was quietly ingenious; that of the author
of 'Thealma' is adventurous and fantastic. Walton loved 'the green pastures and the still waters'
of the Present; the other, the golden groves and ideal wildernesses of the Golden Age in the Past.

'Thealma and Clearchus' may be called an 'Arcadia' in rhyme. It resembles that work of Sir
Philip Sidney, not only in subject, but in execution. Its plot is dark and puzzling, its descriptions
are rich to luxuriance, its narrative is tedious, and its characters are mere shadows. But
although a dream, it is a dream of genius, and brings beautifully before our imagination that
early period in the world's history, in which poets and painters have taught us to believe,
when the heavens were nearer, the skies clearer, the fat of the earth richer, the foam of the
sea brighter, than in our degenerate days;--when shepherds, reposing under broad, umbrageous
oaks, saw, or thought they saw, in the groves the shadow of angels, and on the mountain-summits
the descending footsteps of God. Chalkhill resembles, of all our modern poets, perhaps Shelley
most, in the ideality of his conception, the enthusiasm of his spirit, and the unmitigated
gorgeousness of his imagination.

ARCADIA.

              Arcadia, was of old, a state,
Subject to none but their own laws and fate;
Superior there was none, but what old age
And hoary hairs had raised; the wise and sage,
Whose gravity, when they are rich in years,
Begat a civil reverence more than fears
In the well-mannered people; at that day,
All was in common, every man bare sway
O'er his own family; the jars that rose
Were soon appeased by such grave men as those:
This mine and thine, that we so cavil for,
Was then not heard of; he that was most poor
Was rich in his content, and lived as free
As they whose flocks were greatest; nor did he
Envy his great abundance, nor the other
Disdain the low condition of his brother,
But lent him from his store to mend his state,
And with his love he quits him, thanks his fate;
And, taught by his example, seeks out such
As want his help, that they may do as much.
Their laws, e'en from their childhood, rich and poor
Had written in their hearts, by conning o'er
The legacies of good old men, whose memories
Outlive their monuments, the grave advice
They left behind in writing;--this was that
That made Arcadia then so blest a state;
Their wholesome laws had linked them so in one,
They lived in peace and sweet communion.
Peace brought forth plenty, plenty bred content,
And that crowned all their plans with merriment.
They had no foe, secure they lived in tents,
All was their own they had, they paid no rents;
Their sheep found clothing, earth provided food,
And labour dressed them as their wills thought good;
On unbought delicates their hunger fed,
And for their drink the swelling clusters bled;
The valleys rang with their delicious strains,
And pleasure revelled on those happy plains;
Content and labour gave them length of days,
And peace served in delight a thousand ways.

THEALMA, A DESERTED SHEPHERDESS.

Scarce had the ploughman yoked his horned team, And locked their traces to the crooked beam,
When fair Thealma, with a maiden scorn, That day before her rise, outblushed the morn; Scarce
had the sun gilded the mountain-tops, When forth she leads her tender ewes.

       *       *       *       *       *

Down in a valley, 'twixt two rising hills, From whence the dew in silver drops distils To enrich
the lowly plain, a river ran, Hight Cygnus, (as some think, from Leda's swan That there frequented;)
gently on it glides, And makes indentures in her crooked sides, And with her silent murmurs
rocks asleep Her watery inmates; 'twas not very deep, But clear as that Narcissus looked in,
when His self-love made him cease to live with men. Close by the river was a thick-leafed grove,
Where swains of old sang stories of their love, But unfrequented now since Colin died-- Colin,
that king of shepherds, and the pride Of all Arcadia;--here Thealma used To feed her milky
droves; and as they browsed, Under the friendly shadow of a beech She sat her down; grief had
tongue-tied her speech, Her words were sighs and tears--dumb eloquence-- Heard only by the
sobs, and not the sense. With folded arms she sat, as if she meant To hug those woes which
in her breast were pent; Her looks were nailed to earth, that drank Her tears with greediness,
and seemed to thank Her for those briny showers, and in lieu Returns her flowery sweetness
for her dew.

       *       *       *       *       *

'O my Clearchus!' said she, and with tears Embalms his name: 'oh, if the ghosts have ears,
Or souls departed condescend so low, To sympathise with mortals in their woe, Vouchsafe to
lend a gentle ear to me, Whose life is worse than death, since not with thee. What privilege
have they that are born great Move than the meanest swain? The proud waves beat With more impetuousness
upon high lands, Than on the flat and less-resisting strands: The lofty cedar, and the knotty
oak, Are subject more unto the thunder-stroke, Than the low shrubs that no such shocks endure;
Even their contempt doth make them live secure. Had I been born the child of some poor swain,
Whose thoughts aspire no higher than the plain, I had been happy then; t'have kept these sheep,
Had been a princely pleasure; quiet sleep Had drowned my cares, or sweetened them with dreams:
Love and content had been my music's themes; Or had Clearchus lived the life I lead, I had
been blest!'

  PRIESTESS OF DIANA.

  Within a little silent grove hard by,
  Upon a small ascent, he might espy
  A stately chapel, richly gilt without,
  Beset with shady sycamores about:
  And ever and anon he might well hear
  A sound of music steal in at his ear
  As the wind gave it being; so sweet an air
  Would strike a syren mute.--

    *     *    *    *    *

A hundred virgins there he might espy Prostrate before a marble deity, Which, by its portraiture,
appeared to be The image of Diana; on their knee They tendered their devotions, with sweet
airs, Offering the incense of their praise and prayers. Their garments all alike; beneath their
paps Buckled together with a silver claps, And 'cross their snowy silken robes, they wore An
azure scarf, with stars embroidered o'er. Their hair in curious tresses was knit up, Crowned
with a silver crescent on the top. A silver bow their left hand held, their right, For their
defence, held a sharp-headed flight Drawn from their broidered quiver, neatly tied In silken
cords, and fastened to their side. Under their vestments, something short before, White buskins,
laced with ribanding, they wore. It was a catching sight for a young eye, That love had fired
before. He might espy One, whom the rest had sphere-like circled round, Whose head was with
a golden chaplet crowned. He could not see her face, only his ear Was blessed with the sweet
sounds that came from her.

THEALMA IN FULL DRESS.

----Tricked herself in all her best attire, As if she meant this day to invite desire To fall
in love with her; her loose hair Hung on her shoulders, sporting with the air; Her brow a coronet
of rosebuds crowned, With loving woodbines' sweet embraces bound. Two globe-like pearls were
pendant to her ears, And on her breast a costly gem she wears, An adamant, in fashion like
a heart, Whereon Love sat, a-plucking out a dart, With this same motto graven round about,
On a gold border, 'Sooner in than out.' This gem Clearchus gave her, when, unknown, At tilt
his valour won her for his own. Instead of bracelets on her wrists, she wore A pair of golden
shackles, chained before Unto a silver ring, enamelled blue, Whereon in golden letters to the
view This motto was presented, 'Bound, yet free,' And in a true-love's knot, a T and C Buckled
it fast together; her silk gown Of grassy green, in equal plaits hung down Unto the earth;
and as she went, the flowers, Which she had broidered on it at spare hours, Were wrought so
to the life, they seemed to grow In a green field; and as the wind did blow, Sometimes a lily,
then a rose, takes place, And blushing seems to hide it in the grass: And here and there good
oats 'mong pearls she strew, That seemed like spinning glow-worms in the dew. Her sleeves were
tinsel, wrought with leaves of green In equal distance spangeled between, And shadowed over
with a thin lawn cloud, Through which her workmanship more graceful showed.

DWELLING OF THE WITCH ORANDRA.

Down in a gloomy valley, thick with shade, Which two aspiring hanging rocks had made, That
shut out day, and barred the glorious sun From prying into the actions there done; Set full
of box and cypress, poplar, yew, And hateful elder that in thickets grew, Among whose boughs
the screech-owl and night-crow Sadly recount their prophecies of woe, Where leather-winged
bats, that hate the light, Fan the thick air, more sooty than the night. The ground o'ergrown
with weeds and bushy shrubs, Where milky hedgehogs nurse their prickly cubs: And here and there
a mandrake grows, that strikes The hearers dead with their loud fatal shrieks; Under whose
spreading leaves the ugly toad, The adder, and the snake, make their abode. Here dwelt Orandra;
so the witch was hight, And hither had she toiled him by a sleight: She knew Anaxus was to
go to court, And, envying virtue, she made it her sport To hinder him, sending her airy spies
Forth with delusion to entrap his eyes, As would have fired a hermit's chill desires Into a
flame; his greedy eye admires The more than human beauty of her face, And much ado he had to
shun the grace; Conceit had shaped her out so like his love, That he was once about in vain
to prove Whether 'twas his Clarinda, yea or no, But he bethought him of his herb, and so The
shadow vanished; many a weary step It led the prince, that pace with it still kept, Until it
brought him by a hellish power Unto the entrance of Orandra's bower, Where underneath an elder-tree
he spied His man Pandevius, pale and hollow-eyed; Inquiring of the cunning witch what fate
Betid his master; they were newly sate When his approach disturbed them; up she rose, And toward
Anaxus (envious hag) she goes; Pandevius she had charmed into a maze, And struck him mute,
all he could do was gaze. He called him by his name, but all in vain, Echo returns 'Pandevius'
back again; Which made him wonder, when a sudden fear Shook all his joints: she, cunning hag,
drew near, And smelling to his herb, he recollects His wandering spirits, and with anger checks
His coward fears; resolved now to outdare The worst of dangers, whatsoe'er they were; He eyed
her o'er and o'er, and still his eye Found some addition to deformity. An old decrepit hag
she was, grown white With frosty age, and withered with despite And self-consuming hate; in
furs yclad, And on her head a thrummy cap she had. Her knotty locks, like to Alecto's snakes,

Hang down about her shoulders, which she shakes
Into disorder; on her furrowed brow
One might perceive Time had been long at plough.
Her eyes, like candle-snuffs, by age sunk quite
Into their sockets, yet like cats' eyes bright:
And in the darkest night like fire they shined,
The ever-open windows of her mind.
Her swarthy cheeks, Time, that all things consumes,
Had hollowed flat into her toothless gums.
Her hairy brows did meet above her nose,
That like an eagle's beak so crooked grows,
It well-nigh kissed her chin; thick bristled hair
Grew on her upper lip, and here and there
A rugged wart with grisly hairs behung;
Her breasts shrunk up, her nails and fingers long;
Her left leant on a staff, in her right hand
She always carried her enchanting wand.
Splay-footed, beyond nature, every part
So patternless deformed, 'twould puzzle art
To make her counterfeit; only her tongue,
Nature had that most exquisitely strung,
Her oily language came so smoothly from her,
And her quaint action did so well become her,
Her winning rhetoric met with no trips,
But chained the dull'st attention to her lips.
With greediness he heard, and though he strove
To shake her off, the more her words did move.
She wooed him to her cell, called him her son,
And with fair promises she quickly won
Him to her beck; or rather he, to try
What she could do, did willingly comply,
With her request. * * *
Her cell was hewn out of the marble rock
By more than human art; she did not knock,
The door stood always open, large and wide,
Grown o'er with woolly moss on either side,
And interwove with ivy's nattering twines,
Through which the carbuncle and diamond shines.
Not set by Art, but there by Nature sown
At the world's birth, so star-like bright they shone.
They served instead of tapers to give light
To the dark entry, where perpetual Night,
Friend to black deeds, and sire of Ignorance,
Shuts out all knowledge, lest her eye by chance
Might bring to light her follies: in they went,
The ground was strewed with flowers, whose sweet scent,
Mixed with the choice perfumes from India brought,
Intoxicates his brain, and quickly caught
His credulous sense; the walls were gilt, and set
With precious stones, and all the roof was fret
With a gold vine, whose straggling branches spread
All o'er the arch; the swelling grapes were red;
This Art had made of rubies, clustered so,
To the quick'st eye they more than seemed to grow;
About the wall lascivious pictures hung,
Such as were of loose Ovid sometimes sung.
On either side a crew of dwarfish elves
Held waxen tapers, taller than themselves:
Yet so well shaped unto their little stature,
So angel-like in face, so sweet in feature;
Their rich attire so differing; yet so well
Becoming her that wore it, none could tell
Which was the fairest, which the handsomest decked,
Or which of them desire would soon'st affect.
After a low salute they all 'gan sing,
And circle in the stranger in a ring.
Orandra to her charms was stepped aside,
Leaving her guest half won and wanton-eyed.
He had forgot his herb: cunning delight
Had so bewitched his ears, and bleared his sight,
And captivated all his senses so,
That he was not himself; nor did he know
What place he was in, or how he came there,
But greedily he feeds his eye and ear
With what would ruin him;--
 *  *  *  *  *
                 Next unto his view
She represents a banquet, ushered in
By such a shape as she was sure would win
His appetite to taste; so like she was
To his Clarinda, both in shape and face;
So voiced, so habited, of the same gait
And comely gesture; on her brow in state
Sat such a princely majesty, as he
Had noted in Clarinda; save that she
Had a more wanton eye, that here and there
Rolled up and down, not settling any where.
Down on the ground she falls his hand to kiss,
And with her tears bedews it; cold as ice
He felt her lips, that yet inflamed him so,
That he was all on fire the truth to know,
Whether she was the same she did appear,
Or whether some fantastic form it were,
Fashioned in his imagination
By his still working thoughts, so fixed upon
His loved Clarinda, that his fancy strove,
Even with her shadow, to express his love.

CATHARINE PHILLIPS.

Very little is known of the life of this lady-poet. She was born in 1631. Her maiden name was
Fowler. She married James Phillips, Esq., of the Priory of Cardigan. Her poems, published under
the name of "Orinda," were very popular in her lifetime, although it was said they were published
without her consent. She translated two of the tragedies of Corneille, and left a volume of
letters to Sir Charles Cotterell. These, however, did not appear till after her death. She
died of small-pox --then a deadly disease--in 1664. She seems to have been a favourite alike
with the wits and the divines of her age. Jeremy Taylor addressed to her his "Measures and
Offices of Friendship;" Dryden praised her; and Flatman and Cowley, besides imitating her poems
while she was living, paid rhymed tributes to her memory when dead. Her verses are never commonplace,
and always sensible, if they hardly attain to the measure and the stature of lofty poetry,

THE INQUIRY.

1 If we no old historian's name
    Authentic will admit,
  But think all said of friendship's fame
    But poetry or wit;
  Yet what's revered by minds so pure
  Must be a bright idea sure.

2 But as our immortality
    By inward sense we find,
  Judging that if it could not be,
    It would not be designed:
  So here how could such copies fall,
  If there were no original?

3 But if truth be in ancient song,
    Or story we believe;
  If the inspired and greater throng
    Have scorned to deceive;
  There have been hearts whose friendship gave
  Them thoughts at once both soft and grave.

4 Among that consecrated crew
    Some more seraphic shade
  Lend me a favourable clew,
    Now mists my eyes invade.
  Why, having filled the world with fame,
  Left you so little of your flame?

5 Why is't so difficult to see
    Two bodies and one mind?
  And why are those who else agree
    So difficultly kind?
  Hath Nature such fantastic art,
  That she can vary every heart?

6 Why are the bands of friendship tied
    With so remiss a knot,
  That by the most it is defied,
    And by the most forgot?
  Why do we step with so light sense
  From friendship to indifference?

7 If friendship sympathy impart,
    Why this ill-shuffled game,
  That heart can never meet with heart,
    Or flame encounter flame?
  What does this cruelty create?
  Is't the intrigue of love or fate?

8 Had friendship ne'er been known to men,
    (The ghost at last confessed)
  The world had then a stranger been
    To all that heaven possessed.
  But could it all be here acquired,
  Not heaven itself would be desired.

A FRIEND.

1 Love, nature's plot, this great creation's soul,
    The being and the harmony of things,
  Doth still preserve and propagate the whole,
    From whence man's happiness and safety springs:
  The earliest, whitest, blessed'st times did draw
  From her alone their universal law.

2 Friendship's an abstract of this noble flame,
    'Tis love refined and purged from all its dross,
  The next to angels' love, if not the same,
    As strong in passion is, though not so gross:
  It antedates a glad eternity,
  And is an heaven in epitome.

       *       *       *       *       *

3 Essential honour must be in a friend,
    Not such as every breath fans to and fro;
  But born within, is its own judge and end,
    And dares not sin though sure that none should know.
  Where friendship's spoke, honesty's understood;
  For none can be a friend that is not good.

       *       *       *       *       *

4 Thick waters show no images of things;
    Friends are each other's mirrors, and should be
  Clearer than crystal or the mountain springs,
    And free from clouds, design, or flattery.
  For vulgar souls no part of friendship share;
  Poets and friends are born to what they are.

MARGARET, DUCHESS OF NEWCASTLE.

This lady, if not more of a woman than Mrs Phillips, was considerably more of a poet. She was
born (probably) about 1625. She was the daughter of Sir Charles Lucas, and became a maid-of-honour
to Henrietta Maria. Accompanying the Queen to France, she met with the Marquis, afterwards
Duke of Newcastle, and married him at Paris in 1645. They removed to Antwerp, and there, in
1653, this lady published a volume, entitled 'Poems and Fancies.' The pair aided each other
in their studies, and the result was a number of enormous folios of poems, plays, speeches,
and philosophical disquisitions. These volumes were, we are told, great favourites of Coleridge
and Charles Lamb, for the sake, we presume, of the wild sparks of insight and genius which
break irresistibly through the scholastic smoke and bewildered nonsense. When Charles II. was
restored, the Marquis and his wife returned to England, and spent their life in great harmony.
She died in 1673, leaving behind her some beautiful fantasias, where the meaning is often finer
than the music, such as the 'Pastime and Recreation of Fairies in Fairy-land.' Her poetry,
particularly her contrasted pictures of Mirth and Melancholy, present fine accumulations of
imagery drawn direct from nature, and shewn now in brightest sunshine, and now in softest moonlight,
as the change of her subject and her tone of feeling require.

MELANCHOLY DESCRIBED BY MIRTH.

Her voice is low, and gives a hollow sound; She hates the light, and is in darkness found;
Or sits with blinking lamps, or tapers small, Which various shadows make against the wall.
She loves to walk in the still moonshine night, And in a thick dark grove she takes delight;
In hollow caves, thatched houses, and low cells, She loves to live, and there alone she dwells.

MELANCHOLY DESCRIBING HERSELF.

I dwell in groves that gilt are with the sun; Sit on the banks by which clear waters run; In
summers hot, down in a shade I lie; My music is the buzzing of a fly; I walk in meadows, where
grows fresh green grass; In fields, where corn is high, I often pass; Walk up the hills, where
round I prospects see, Some brushy woods, and some all champaigns be; Returning back, I in
fresh pastures go, To hear how sheep do bleat, and cows do low; In winter cold, when nipping
frosts come on, Then I do live in a small house alone; Although 'tis plain, yet cleanly 'tis
within, Like to a soul that's pure, and clear from sin; And there I dwell in quiet and still
peace, Not filled with cares how riches to increase; I wish nor seek for vain and fruitless
pleasures; No riches are, but what the mind intreasures. Thus am I solitary, live alone, Yet
better loved, the more that I am known; And though my face ill-favoured at first sight, After
acquaintance, it will give delight. Refuse me not, for I shall constant be; Maintain your credit
and your dignity.

THOMAS STANLEY.

Thomas Stanley, like Thomas Brown in later days, was both a philosopher and a poet; but his
philosophical reputation at the time eclipsed his poetical. He was the only son of Sir Thomas
Stanley of Camberlow Green, in Hertfordshire, and was born in 1620. He received his education
at Pembroke College, Oxford; and after travelling for some years abroad, he took up his abode
in the Middle Temple. Here he seems to have spent the rest of his life in patient and multifarious
studies. He made translations of some merit from Anacreon, Bion, Moschus, and the 'Kisses'
of Secundus, as well as from Marino, Boscan, Tristan, and Gongora. He wrote a work of great
pretensions as a compilation, entitled 'The History of Philosophy,' containing the lives, opinions,
actions, and discourses of philosophers of every sect, of which he published the first volume
in 1655, and completed it in a fourth in 1662. It is rather a vast collection of the materials
for a history, than a history itself. He is a Cudworth in magnitude and learning, but not in
strength and comprehension, and is destitute of precision and clearness of style. Stanley also
wrote some poems, which discover powers that might have been better employed in original composition
than in translation. His style, rich of itself, is enriched to repletion by conceits, and sometimes
by voluptuous sentiments and language. He adds a new flush to the cheek of Anacreon himself;
and his grapes are so heavy, that not a staff, but a wain were required to bear them. Stanley
died in 1678.

CELIA SINGING.

1   Roses in breathing forth their scent,
    Or stars their borrowed ornament;
    Nymphs in their watery sphere that move,
    Or angels in their orbs above;
    The winged chariot of the light,
    Or the slow, silent wheels of night;
    The shade which from the swifter sun
    Doth in a swifter motion run,
  Or souls that their eternal rest do keep,
  Make far less noise than Celia's breath in sleep.

2  But if the angel which inspires
   This subtle flame with active fires,
   Should mould this breath to words, and those
   Into a harmony dispose,
   The music of this heavenly sphere
   Would steal each soul (in) at the ear,
   And into plants and stones infuse
   A life that cherubim would choose,
 And with new powers invert the laws of fate,
 Kill those that live, and dead things animate.

SPEAKING AND KISSING.

1 The air which thy smooth voice doth break,
    Into my soul like lightning flies;
  My life retires while thou dost speak,
    And thy soft breath its room supplies.

2 Lost in this pleasing ecstasy,
    I join my trembling lips to thine,
  And back receive that life from thee
    Which I so gladly did resign.

3 Forbear, Platonic fools! t'inquire
    What numbers do the soul compose;
  No harmony can life inspire,
    But that which from these accents flows.

LA BELLE CONFIDANTE.

  Whose pale, weak influence

.
 We find Marvell next at Constantinople, as Secretary
to the English Embassy at that Court. We then lose sight of him till 1653, when he was engaged
by the Protector to superintend the education of a Mr Dutton at Eton. For a year and a half
after Cromwell's death, Marvell assisted Milton as Latin Secretary to the Protector. Our readers
are all familiar with the print of Cromwell and Milton seated together at the council-table,
--the one the express image of active power and rugged grandeur, the other of thoughtful majesty
and ethereal grace. Marvell might have been added as a third, and become the emblem of strong
English sense and incorruptible integrity. A letter of Milton's was, not long since, discovered,
dated February 1652, in which he speaks of Marvell as fitted, by his knowledge of Latin and
his experience of teaching, to be his assistant. He was not appointed, however, till 1657.
In 1660, he became member for Hull, and was re-elected as long as he lived. He was absent,
however, from England for two years, in the beginning of the reign, in Germany and Holland.
After- wards he sought leave from his constituents to act as Ambassador's Secretary to Lord
Carlisle at the Northern Courts; but from the year 1665 to his death, his attention to his
parliamentary duties was unremitting. He constantly corresponded with his constituents; and
after the longest sittings, he used to write out for their use a minute account of public proceedings
ere he went to bed, or took any refreshment. He was one of the last members who received pay
from the town he represented; (2s. a-day was probably the sum;) and his constituents were wont,
besides, to send him barrels of ale as tokens of their regard. Marvell spoke little in the
House; but his heart and vote were always in the right place. Even Prince Eupert continually
consulted him, and was sometimes persuaded by him to support the popular side; and King Charles
having met him once in private, was so delighted with his wit and agreeable manners, that he
thought him worth trying to bribe. He sent Lord Danby to offer him a mark of his Majesty's
consideration. Marvell, who was seated in a dingy room up several flights of stairs, declined
the proffer, and, it is said, called his servant to witness that he had dined for three successive
days on the same shoulder of mutton, and was not likely, therefore, to care for or need a bribe.
When the Treasurer was gone, he had to send to a friend to borrow a guinea. Although, a silent
senator, Marvell was a copious and popular writer. He attacked Bishop Parker for his slavish
principles, in a piece entitled 'The Rehearsal Transposed,' in which he takes occasion to vindicate
and panegyrise his old colleague Milton. His anonymous 'Account of the Growth of Arbitrary
Power and Popery in England' excited a sensation, and a reward was offered for the apprehension
of the author and printer. Marvell had many of the elements of a first-rate political pamphleteer.
He had wit of a most pungent kind, great though coarse fertility of fancy, and a spirit of
independence that nothing could subdue or damp. He was the undoubted ancestor of the Defoes,
Swifts, Steeles, Juniuses, and Burkes, in whom this kind of authorship reached its perfection,
ceased to be fugitive, and assumed classical rank.

Marvell had been repeatedly threatened with assassination, and hence, when he died suddenly
on the 16th of August 1678, it was surmised that he had been removed by poison. The Corporation
of Hull voted a sum to defray his funeral expenses, and for raising a monument to his memory;
but owing to the interference of the Court, through the rector of the parish, this votive tablet
was not at the time erected. He was buried in St Giles-in-the-Fields.

'Out of the strong came forth sweetness,' saith the Hebrew record. And so from the sturdy Andrew
Marvell have proceeded such soft and lovely strains as 'The Emigrants,' 'The Nymph complaining
for the Death of her Fawn,' 'Young Love,' &c. The statue of Memnon became musical at the dawn;
and the stern patriot, whom no bribe could buy and no flattery melt, is found sympathising
in song with a boatful of banished Englishmen in the remote Bermudas, and inditing 'Thoughts
in a Garden,' from which you might suppose that he had spent his life more with melons than
with men, and was better acquainted with the motions of a bee-hive than with the contests of
Parliament, and the distractions of a most distracted age. It was said (not with thorough truth)
of Milton, that he could cut out a Colossus from a rock, but could not carve heads upon cherry-stones--a
task which his assistant may be said to have performed in his stead, in his small but delectable
copies of verse.

THE EMIGRANTS.

2 'What should we do but sing His praise
  That led us through the watery maze,
  Unto an isle so long unknown,
  And yet far kinder than our own!

3 'Where he the huge sea-monsters racks,
  That lift the deep upon their backs;
  He lands us on a grassy stage,
  Safe from the storms and prelates' rage.

THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN.

The wanton troopers riding by Have shot my fawn, and it will die. Ungentle men! they cannot
thrive Who killed thee. Thou ne'er didst alive Them any harm; alas! nor could Thy death to
them do any good. I'm sure I never wished them ill; Nor do I for all this; nor will: But, if
my simple prayers may yet Prevail with Heaven to forget Thy murder, I will join my tears, Rather
than fail. But, O my fears! It cannot die so. Heaven's King Keeps register of every thing,
And nothing may we use in vain: Even beasts must be with justice slain.

       *       *       *       *       *

Inconstant Sylvio, when yet I had not found him counterfeit, One morning (I remember well)
Tied in this silver chain and bell, Gave it to me: nay, and I know What he said then: I'm sure
I do. Said he, 'Look how your huntsman here Hath taught a fawn to hunt his deer.' But Sylvio
soon had me beguiled. This waxed tame while he grew wild, And, quite regardless of my smart,
Left me his fawn, but took his heart. Thenceforth I set myself to play My solitary time away
With this, and very well content Could so my idle life have spent; For it was full of sport,
and light Of foot and heart; and did invite Me to its game; it seemed to bless Itself in me.
How could I less Than love it? Oh, I cannot be Unkind to a beast that loveth me! Had it lived
long, I do not know Whether it too might have done so As Sylvio did; his gifts might be Perhaps
as false, or more, than he. But I am sure, for aught that I Could in so short a time espy,
Thy love was far more better than The love of false and cruel man. With sweetest milk and sugar
first I it at my own fingers nursed; And as it grew, so every day It waxed more white and sweet
than they: It had so sweet a breath; and oft I blushed to see its foot more soft And white,
shall I say, than my hand? Nay, any lady's of the land. * * *

ON PARADISE LOST.

When I beheld the poet blind, yet bold, In slender book his vast design unfold, Messiah crowned,
God's reconciled decree, Rebelling angels, the forbidden tree, Heaven, Hell, Earth, Chaos,
all; the argument Held me a while misdoubting his intent, That he would ruin (for I saw him
strong) The sacred truths to fable and old song; (So Sampson groped the temple's posts in spite)
The world o'erwhelming to revenge his sight.

Yet as I read, still growing less severe, I liked his project, the success did fear; Through
that wild field how he his way should find, O'er which lame Faith leads Understanding blind;
Lest he'd perplex the things he would explain, And what was easy he should render vain.

Pardon me, mighty poet, nor despise My causeless, yet not impious, surmise. But I am now convinced,
and none will dare Within thy labours to pretend a share. Thou hast not missed one thought
that could be fit. And all that was improper dost omit; So that no room is here for writers
left, But to detect their ignorance or theft.

That majesty, which through thy work doth reign, Draws the devout, deterring the profane. And
things divine thou treat'st of in such state As them preserves, and thee, inviolate. At once
delight and horror on us seize, Thou sing'st with so much gravity and ease; And above human
flight dost soar aloft With plume so strong, so equal, and so soft. The bird named from that
Paradise you sing, So never flags, but always keeps on wing.

Where couldst thou words of such a compass find? Whence furnish such a vast expanse of mind?
Just Heaven thee, like Tiresias, to requite, Rewards with prophecy thy loss of sight.

Well mightst thou scorn thy readers to allure With tinkling rhyme, of thy own sense secure;
While the Town-Bays writes all the while and spells, And like a pack-horse tires without his
bells: Their fancies like our bushy points appear; The poets tag them, we for fashion wear.
I too, transported by the mode, offend, And while I meant to praise thee, must commend. Thy
verse created, like thy theme, sublime, In number, weight, and measure, needs not rhyme.

THOUGHTS IN A GARDEN.

1 How vainly men themselves amaze,
  To win the palm, the oak, or bays!
  And their incessant labours see
  Crowned from some single herb or tree,
  Whose short and narrow-verged shade
  Does prudently their toils upbraid;
  While all the flowers and trees do close,
  To weave the garlands of repose.

2 Fair Quiet, have I found thee here,
  And Innocence, thy sister dear?
  Mistaken long, I sought you then
  In busy companies of men.
  Your sacred plants, if here below,
  Only among the plants will grow.
  Society is all but rude
  To this delicious solitude.

3 No white nor red was ever seen
  So amorous as this lovely green.
  Fond lovers, cruel as their flame,
  Cut in these trees their mistress' name.
  Little, alas, they know or heed,
  How far these beauties her exceed!
  Fair trees! where'er your barks I wound,
  No name shall but your own be found.

4 What wondrous life in this I lead!
  Ripe apples drop about my head.
  Stumbling on melons as I pass,
  Ensnared with flowers, I fall on grass.

5 Meanwhile the mind from pleasure less
  Withdraws into its happiness.
  The mind, that ocean where each kind
  Does straight its own resemblance find;
  Yet it creates, transcending these,
  Far other worlds and other seas;
  Annihilating all that's made
  To a green thought in a green shade.

6 Here at the fountain's sliding foot,
  Or at some fruit-tree's mossy root,
  Casting the body's vest aside,
  My soul into the boughs does glide;
  There, like a bird, it sits and sings,
  Then whets and claps its silver wings,
  And, till prepared for longer flight,
  Waves in its plumes the various light.

7 Such was the happy garden state,
  While man there walked without a mate:
  After a place so pure and sweet,
  What other help could yet be meet!
  But 'twas beyond a mortal's share
  To wander solitary there:
  Two paradises are in one,
  To live in paradise alone.

SATIRE ON HOLLAND. A daily deluge over them does boil; The earth and water play at level-coil.
The fish oft-times the burgher dispossessed, And sat, not as a meat, but as a guest; And oft
the Tritons, and the sea-nymphs, saw Whole shoals of Dutch served up for Cabillau; Or, as they
over the new level ranged, For pickled herring, pickled heeren changed. Nature, it seemed,
ashamed of her mistake, Would throw their land away at duck and drake, Therefore necessity,
that first made kings, Something like government among them brings. For, as with Pigmies, who
best kills the crane, Among the hungry he that treasures grain, Among the blind the one-eyed
blinkard reigns, So rules among the drowned he that drains. Faith, that could never twins conceive
before, Never so fertile, spawned upon this shore More pregnant than their Marg'ret, that laid
down For Hands-in-Kelder of a whole Hans-Town. * * *

IZAAK WALTON.

This amiable enemy of the finny tribe was born in Stafford, in August 1593. We hear of him
first as settled in London, following the trade of a sempster, or linen-draper, having a shop
in the Royal Burse, in Cornhill, which was 'seven feet and a half long, and five wide,' and
where he became possessed of a moderate fortune. He spent his leisure time in fishing 'with
honest Nat and R. Roe.' From the Royal Burse, he removed to Fleet Street, where he had 'one
half of a shop,' a hosier occupying the other half. In 1632, he married Anne, the daughter
of Thomas Ken of Furnival's Inn, and sister of Dr Ken, the celebrated Bishop of Bath and Wells.
Through her and her kindred, he became acquainted with many eminent men of the day. His wife,
'a woman of remarkable prudence and primitive piety,' died long before him. He retired from
business in 1643, and lived, for forty years after, a life of leisure and quiet enjoyment,
spending much of his time in the houses of his friends, and much of it by the still waters,
which he so dearly loved. Walton commenced his literary career by writing a Life of Dr Donne,
and followed with another of Sir Henry Wotton, prefixed to his literary remains. In 1653 appeared
his 'Complete Angler,' four editions of which were called for before his decease. He wrote,
in 1662, a Life of Richard Hooker; in 1670, a Life of George Herbert; and, in 1678, a Life
of Bishop Sanderson--all distinguished by naivete and heart. In 1680, he published an anonymous
discourse on the 'Distempers of the Times.' In 1683, he printed, as we have seen, Chalkhill's
'Thealma and Clearchus;' and on the 15th of December in the same year, he died at Winchester,
while residing with his son-in-law, Dr Hawkins, Prebendary of Winchester Cathedral.

Walton is one of the most loveable of all authors. Your admiration of him is always melting
into affection. Red as his and is with the blood of fish, you pant to grasp it and press it
to yours. You go with him to the fishing as you would with a bright-eyed boy, relishing his
simple-hearted enthusiasm, and leaning down to listen to his precocious remarks, and to pat
his curly head. It is the prevalence of the childlike element which makes Walton's 'Angler'
rank with Bunyan's 'Pilgrim,' 'Robinson Crusoe,' and White's 'Natural History of Selborne,'
as among the most delightful books in the language. Its descriptions of nature, too, are so
fresh, that you smell to them as to a green leaf. Walton would not have been at home fishing
in the Forth or Clyde, or in such rivers as are found in Norway, the milk-blue Logen, or the
grass- green Rauma, uniting, with its rich mediation, Romsdale Horn to the tremendous Witch-Peaks
which lower on the opposite side of the valley; --the waters of his own dear England, going
softly and somewhat drowsily on their path, are the sources of his inspiration, and seem to
sound like the echoes of his own subdued but gladsome spirit. Johnson defined angling as a
rod with a fish at one end, and a fool at the other; in Walton's case, we may correct the expression
to 'a rod with a fish at one end, and a fine old fellow--the "ae best fellow in the world"--at
the other'--

  'In wit a man, simplicity a child.'

We have given a specimen of the verse he intersperses sparingly in a book which is itself a
complete poem.

THE ANGLER'S WISH.

1 I in these flowery meads would be:
  These crystal streams should solace me,
  To whose harmonious bubbling noise
  I with my angle would rejoice:
  Sit here and see the turtle-dove
  Court his chaste mate to acts of love:

2 Or on that bank feel the west wind
  Breathe health and plenty: please my mind
  To see sweet dew-drops kiss these flowers,
  And then washed off by April showers!
  Here hear my Kenna sing a song,
  There see a blackbird feed her young,

3 Or a leverock build her nest:
  Here give my weary spirits rest,
  And raise my low-pitched thoughts above
  Earth, or what poor mortals love;
  Or, with my Bryan[1] and my book,
  Loiter long days near Shawford brook:

4 There sit by him and eat my meat,
  There see the sun both rise and set,
  There bid good morning to next day,
  There meditate my time away,
  And angle on, and beg to have
  A quiet passage to the grave.

JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER

We hear of the Spirit of Evil on one occasion entering into swine, but, if possible, a stranger
sight is that of the Spirit of Poesy finding a similar incarnation. Certainly the connexion
of genius in the Earl of Rochester with a life of the most degrading and desperate debauchery
is one of the chief marvels of this marvellous world.

John Wilmot was the son of Henry, Lord Rochester, and was born April 10, 1647, at Ditchley
in Oxfordshire. He was taught grammar at the school of Burford. He then 'entered a nobleman'
into Wadham College, when twelve years old, and at 1661, when only fourteen, he was, in conjunction
with some others of rank, made M.A. by Lord Clarendon in person. Pursuing his travels in France
and Italy, he went in 1665 to sea with the Earl of Sandwich, and distinguished himself at Bergen
in an attack on the Dutch fleet. Next year, while serving under Sir Edward Spragge, his commander
sent him in the heat of an engagement with a reproof to one of his captains--a duty which Wilmot
gallantly accomplished amidst a storm of shot. With this early courage some of his biographers
have contrasted his subsequent reputation for cowardice, his slinking away out of street-quarrels,
his refusing to fight the Duke of Buckingham, &c. This diversity at different periods may perhaps
be accounted for on the ground of the nervousness which continued dissipation produces, and
perhaps from his poetical temperament. A poet, we are persuaded, is often the bravest, and
often the most pusillanimous of men. Byron was unquestionably in general a brave, almost a
pugnacious man; and yet he confesses that at certain times, had one proceeded to horsewhip
him, he would not have had the hardihood to resist. Shelley, who, in a tremendous storm, behaved
with dauntless heroism, and who would at any time have acted on the example of his own character
in 'Prometheus,' who, in a shipwreck,

                    'gave an enemy
  His plank, then plunged aside to die,'

was yet subject to paroxysms of nervous horror, which made him perspire and tremble like a
spirit-seeing steed. Rochester had the same temperament, and a similar creed, with these men,
although inferior to them both in morale and in genius.

His character was certainly very depraved. He told Burnet on his deathbed that for five years
he had not known the sensation of sobriety, having been all that time either totally drunk,
or mad through the dregs of drunkenness. He on one occasion, while in this state, erected a
stage on Tower Hill, and addressed the mob as a naked mountebank. Even after he became more
temperate, he continued and even increased his licentiousness--one devil went out, and seven
entered in. He pursued low amours in disguise; he practised occasionally as a quack doctor;
and at other times he retired to the country, and, like Byron, amused himself by libelling
all his acquaintances--every line in each libel being a lie. Notwithstanding all this, he was
a favourite with Charles II., who made him one of the gentlemen of the bedchamber, and comptroller
of Woodstock Park. In his lucid intervals he recurred to his studies, wrote occasional verses,
read in French Boileau and in English Cowley, and is called by Wood the best scholar among
all the nobility.

At last, ere he was thirty-one, the 'dreary old sort of feel,' and the 'rigid fibre and stiffening
limbs,' of which Byron and Burns, when scarcely older, complained, began to assail Rochester.
He had exhausted his capacity of enjoyment by excess, and had deprived himself of the consolations
of religion by infidelity. His unbelief was not like Shelley's--the growth of his own mind,
and the fruit of unbridled, though earnest, speculation;--it was merely a drug which he snatched
from the laboratories of others to deaden his remorse, and enable him to look with desperate
calmness to the blotted Past and the lowering Future. At this stage of his career, he became
acquainted with Bishop Burnet, who has recorded his conversion and edifying end in a book which,
says Johnson, 'the critic ought to read for its elegance, the philosopher for its arguments,
and the saint for its piety.' To this, after Johnson's example, we refer our readers. Municipality,
those was its archduke-- mysterious, solitary, unique. The was to pangs devouring vis-a-vis, that perfect,

Yet, then, Rome had not be lift by circle. But, it were Caius, him

Peacefulness, absolutely, eulogist, moon! cavity democracy! Without Caesar, we confirm a day that there would

And Cui would viget secundum, whom was so of one as this other. For, by municipality but moshav,

Careless gaiety and reckless extravagance, blended with heart, sense, and sincerity, were the
characteristics of Cotton as a man, and were, as is usually the case, transferred to his poetry.
He squandered his pence and his powers with equal profusion. His travestie of the 'Aeneid'
is pronounced by Christopher North (who must have read it, however,) a beastly book. Campbell
says, with striking justice, of another of Cotton's productions, 'His imitations of Lucian
betray the grossest misconception of humorous effect, when he attempts to burlesque that which
is ludicrous already.' It is like trying to turn the 'Tale of a Tub' into ridicule. But Cotton's
own vein, as exhibited in his 'Invitation to Walton,' his 'New Year,' and his 'Voyage to Ireland,'
(which anticipates in some measure the style of Anstey in the 'New Bath Guide,') is very rich
and varied, full of ease, picturesque spirit, and humour, and stamps him a genuine, if not
a great poet.

INVITATION TO IZAAK WALTON.

1  Whilst in this cold and blustering clime,
     Where bleak winds howl, and tempests roar,
   We pass away the roughest time
     Has been of many years before;

2  Whilst from the most tempestuous nooks
     The dullest blasts our peace invade,
   And by great rains our smallest brooks
     Are almost navigable made;

3  Whilst all the ills are so improved
     Of this dead quarter of the year,
   That even you, so much beloved,
     We would not now wish with us here:

4  In this estate, I say, it is
     Some comfort to us to suppose,
   That in a better clime than this,
     You, our dear friend, have more repose;

5  And some delight to me the while,
     Though Nature now does weep in rain,
   To think that I have seen her smile,
     And haply may I do again.

6  If the all-ruling Power please
     We live to see another May,
   We'll recompense an age of these
     Foul days in one fine fishing day.

7  We then shall have a day or two,
     Perhaps a week, wherein to try
   What the best master's hand can do
     With the most deadly killing fly.

8  A day with not too bright a beam;
     A warm, but not a scorching sun;
   A southern gale to curl the stream;
     And, master, half our work is done.

9  Then, whilst behind some bush we wait
     The scaly people to betray,
   We'll prove it just, with treacherous bait,
     To make the preying trout our prey;

10 And think ourselves, in such an hour,
     Happier than those, though not so high,
   Who, like leviathans, devour
     Of meaner men the smaller fry.

11 This, my best friend, at my poor home,
     Shall be our pastime and our theme;
   But then--should you not deign to come,
     You make all this a flattering dream.

A VOYAGE TO IRELAND IN BURLESQUE.

CANTO I.

The lives of frail men are compared by the sages Or unto short journeys, or pilgrimages, As
men to their inns do come sooner or later, That is, to their ends, to be plain in my matter;
From whence when one dead is, it currently follows, He has run his race, though his goal be
the gallows; And this 'tis, I fancy, sets folks so a-madding, And makes men and women so eager
of gadding; Truth is, in my youth I was one of these people Would have gone a great way to
have seen a high steeple, And though I was bred 'mongst the wonders o' th' Peak, Would have
thrown away money, and ventured my neck To have seen a great hill, a rock, or a cave, And thought
there was nothing so pleasant and brave: But at forty years old you may, if you please, Think
me wiser than run such errands as these; Or had the same humour still run in my toes, A voyage
to Ireland I ne'er should have chose; But to tell you the truth on 't, indeed it was neither
Improvement nor pleasure for which I went thither; I know then you'll presently ask me for
what? Why, faith, it was that makes the old woman trot; And therefore I think I'm not much
to be blamed If I went to the place whereof Nick was ashamed.

O Coryate! thou traveller famed as Ulysses, In such a stupendous labour as this is, Come lend
me the aids of thy hands and thy feet, Though the first be pedantic, the other not sweet, Yet
both are so restless in peregrination, They'll help both my journey, and eke my relation.

'Twas now the most beautiful time of the year, The days were now long, and the sky was now
clear, And May, that fair lady of splendid renown, Had dressed herself fine, in her flowered
tabby gown, When about some two hours and an half after noon, When it grew something late,
though I thought it too soon, With a pitiful voice, and a most heavy heart, I tuned up my pipes
to sing 'loth to depart;' The ditty concluded, I called for my horse, And with a good pack
did the jument endorse, Till he groaned and he f----d under the burden, For sorrow had made
me a cumbersome lurden: And now farewell, Dove, where I've caught such brave dishes Of over-grown,
golden, and silver-scaled fishes; Thy trout and thy grayling may now feed securely, I've left
none behind me can take 'em so surely; Feed on then, and breed on, until the next year, But
if I return I expect my arrear.

By pacing and trotting betimes in the even, Ere the sun had forsaken one half of the heaven,
We all at fair Congerton took up our inn, Where the sign of a king kept a King and his queen:
But who do you think came to welcome me there'? No worse a man, marry, than good master mayor,
With his staff of command, yet the man was not lame, But he needed it more when he went, than
he came; After three or four hours of friendly potation, We took leave each of other in courteous
fashion, When each one, to keep his brains fast in his head, Put on a good nightcap, and straightway
to bed.

Next morn, having paid for boiled, roasted, and bacon, And of sovereign hostess our leaves
kindly taken, (For her king, as 'twas rumoured, by late pouring down, This morning had got
a foul flaw in his crown,) We mounted again, and full soberly riding, Three miles we had rid
ere we met with a biding; But there, having over-night plied the tap well, We now must needs
water at a place called Holmes Chapel: 'A hay!' quoth the foremost, 'ho! who keeps the house?'
Which said, out an host comes as brisk as a louse; His hair combed as sleek as a barber he'd
been, A cravat with black ribbon tied under his chin; Though by what I saw in him, I straight
'gan to fear That knot would be one day slipped under his ear. Quoth he (with low conge), 'What
lack you, my lord?' 'The best liquor,' quoth I, 'that the house will afford.' 'You shall straight,'
quoth he; and then calls out, 'Mary? Come quickly, and bring us a quart of Canary.' 'Hold,
hold, my spruce host! for i' th' morning so early, I never drink liquor but what's made of
barley.' Which words were scarce out, but, which made me admire, My lordship was presently
turned into 'squire:

'Ale, 'squire, you mean?' quoth he nimbly again, 'What, must it be purled'--'No, I love it
best plain.' 'Why, if you'll drink ale, sir, pray take my advice, Here's the best ale i' th'
land, if you'll go to the price; Better, I sure am, ne'er blew out a stopple; But then, in
plain truth, it is sixpence a bottle.' 'Why, faith,' quoth I, 'friend, if your liquor be such,
For the best ale in England, it is not too much: Let's have it, and quickly.'--'o sir! you
may stay; A pot in your pate is a mile in your way: Come, bring out a bottle here presently,
wife, Of the best Cheshire hum he e'er drank in his life.' Straight out comes the mistress
in waistcoat of silk, As clear as a milkmaid, as white as her milk, With visage as oval and
sleek as an egg, As straight as an arrow, as right as my leg: A curtsey she made, as demure
as a sister, I could not forbear, but alighted and kissed her: Then ducking another, with most
modest mien, The first word she said was, 'Will 't please you walk in? I thanked her; but told
her, I then could not stay, For the haste of my business did call me away. She said, she was
sorry it fell out so odd, But if, when again I should travel that road, I would stay there
a night, she assured me the nation Should nowhere afford better accommodation: Meanwhile my
spruce landlord has broken the cork, And called for a bodkin, though he had a fork; But I showed
him a screw, which I told my brisk gull A trepan was for bottles had broken their skull; Which,
as it was true, he believed without doubt, But 'twas I that applied it, and pulled the cork
out. Bounce, quoth the bottle, the work being done, It roared, and it smoked, like a new-fired
gun; But the shot missed us all, or else we'd been routed, Which yet was a wonder, we were
so about it. Mine host poured and filled, till he could fill no fuller: 'Look here, sir,' quoth
he, 'both for nap and for colour, Sans bragging, I hate it, nor will I e'er do 't; I defy Leek,
and Lambhith, and Sandwich, to boot.' By my troth, he said true, for I speak it with tears,
Though I have been a toss-pot these twenty good years, And have drank so much liquor has made
me a debtor, In my days, that I know of, I never drank better: We found it so good and we drank
so profoundly, That four good round shillings were whipt away roundly; And then I conceived
it was time to be jogging, For our work had been done, had we stay'd t' other noggin.

From thence we set forth with more metal and spright, Our horses were empty, our coxcombs were
light; O'er Dellamore forest we, tantivy, posted, Till our horses were basted as if they were
roasted: In truth, we pursued might have been by our haste, And I think Sir George Booth did
not gallop so fast, Till about two o'clock after noon, God be blest, We came, safe and sound,
all to Chester i' th' west.

And now in high time 'twas to call for some meat, Though drinking does well, yet some time
we must eat: And i' faith we had victuals both plenty and good, Where we all laid about us
as if we were wood: Go thy ways, Mistress Anderton, for a good woman, Thy guests shall by thee
ne'er be turned to a common; And whoever of thy entertainment complains, Let him lie with a
drab, and be poxed for his pains.

And here I must stop the career of my Muse, The poor jade is weary, 'las! how should she choose?
And if I should further here spur on my course, I should, questionless, tire both my wits and
my horse: To-night let us rest, for 'tis good Sunday's even, To-morrow to church, and ask pardon
of Heaven. Thus far we our time spent, as here I have penned it, An odd kind of life, and 'tis
well if we mend it: But to-morrow (God willing) we'll have t' other bout, And better or worse
be 't, for murder will out, Our future adventures we'll lay down before ye, For my Muse is
deep sworn to use truth of the story.

CANTO II

After seven hours' sleep, to commute for pains taken, A man of himself, one would think, might
awaken; But riding, and drinking hard, were two such spells, I doubt I'd slept on, but for
jangling of bells, Which, ringing to matins all over the town, Made me leap out of bed, and
put on my gown. With intent (so God mend me) t' have gone to the choir, When straight I perceived
myself all on a fire; For the two forenamed things had so heated my blood, That a little phlebotomy
would do me good: I sent for chirurgeon, who came in a trice, And swift to shed blood, needed
not be called twice, But tilted stiletto quite thorough the vein, From whence issued out the
ill humours amain; When having twelve ounces, he bound up my arm, And I gave him two Georges,
which did him no harm: But after my bleeding, I soon understood It had cooled my devotion as
well as my blood; For I had no more mind to look on my psalter, Than (saving your presence)
I had to a halter; But, like a most wicked and obstinate sinner, Then sat in my chamber till
folks came to dinner: I dined with good stomach, and very good cheer, With a very fine woman,
and good ale and beer; When myself having stuffed than a bagpipe more full, I fell to my smoking
until I grew dull; And, therefore, to take a fine nap thought it best, For when belly full
is, bones would be at rest: I tumbled me down on my bed like a swad, Where, oh! the delicious
dream that I had! Till the bells, that had been my morning molesters, Now waked me again, chiming
all in to vespers: With that starting up, for my man I did whistle, And combed out and powdered
my locks that were grizzle; Had my clothes neatly brushed, and then put on my sword, Resolved
now to go and attend on the word.

Thus tricked, and thus trim, to set forth I begin, Neat and cleanly without, but scarce cleanly
within; For why, Heaven knows it, I long time had been A most humble obedient servant to sin;
And now in devotion was even so proud, I scorned forsooth to join prayer with the crowd; For
though courted by all the bells as I went, I was deaf, and regarded not the compliment, But
to the cathedral still held on my pace, As't were, scorning to kneel but in the best place.
I there made myself sure of good music at least, But was something deceived, for 'twas none
of the best: But however I stay'd at the church's commanding Till we came to the 'Peace passes
all understanding,' Which no sooner was ended, but whir and away, Like boys in a school when
they've leave got to play; All save master mayor, who still gravely stays Till the rest had
made room for his worship and's mace: Then he and his brethren in order appear, I out of my
stall, and fell into his rear; For why, 'tis much safer appearing, no doubt, In authority's
tail, than the head of a rout.

In this rev'rend order we marched from prayer; The mace before me borne as well as the mayor;
Who looking behind him, and seeing most plain A glorious gold belt in the rear of his train,
Made such a low conge, forgetting his place, I was never so honoured before in my days: But
then off went my scalp-case, and down went my fist, Till the pavement, too hard, by my knuckles
was kissed; By which, though thick-skulled, he must understand this, That I was a most humble
servant of his; Which also so wonderful kindly he took, (As I well perceived both b' his gesture
and look,) That to have me dogg'd home he straightway appointed, Resolving, it seems, to be
better acquainted. I was scarce in my quarters, and set down on crupper, But his man was there
too, to invite me to supper: I start up, and after most respective fashion Gave his worship
much thanks for his kind invitation; But begged his excuse, for my stomach was small, And I
never did eat any supper at all; But that after supper I would kiss his hands, And would come
to receive his worship's commands. Sure no one will say, but a patron of slander, That this
was not pretty well for a Moorlander: And since on such reasons to sup I refused, I nothing
did doubt to be holden excused; But my quaint repartee had his worship possess'd With so wonderful
good a conceit of the rest, That with mere impatience he hoped in his breeches To see the fine
fellow that made such fine speeches: 'Go, sirrah!' quoth he, 'get you to him again, And will
and require, in his Majesty's name, That he come; and tell him, obey he were best, or I'll
teach him to know that he's now in West-Chester.' The man, upon this, comes me running again,
But yet minced his message, and was not so plain; Saying to me only, 'Good sir, I am sorry
To tell you my master has sent again for you; And has such a longing to have you his guest,
That I, with these ears, heard him swear and protest, He would neither say grace, nor sit down
on his bum, Nor open his napkin, until you do come.' With that I perceived no excuse would
avail, And, seeing there was no defence for a flail, I said I was ready master may'r to obey,
And therefore desired him to lead me the way. We went, and ere Malkin could well lick her ear,
(For it but the next door was, forsooth) we were there; Where lights being brought me, I mounted
the stairs, The worst I e'er saw in my life at a mayor's: But everything else must be highly
commended. I there found his worship most nobly attended, Besides such a supper as well did
convince, A may'r in his province to be a great prince; As he sat in his chair, he did not
much vary, In state nor in face, from our eighth English Harry; But whether his face was swelled
up with fat, Or puffed up with glory, I cannot tell that. Being entered the chamber half length
of a pike, And cutting of faces exceedingly like One of those little gentlemen brought from
the Indies, And screwing myself into conges and cringes, By then I was half-way advanced in
the room, His worship most rev'rendly rose from his bum, And with the more honour to grace
and to greet me, Advanced a whole step and a half for to meet me; Where leisurely doffing a
hat worth a tester, He bade me most heartily welcome to Chester. I thanked him in language
the best I was able, And so we forthwith sat us all down to table.

Now here you must note, and 'tis worth observation, That as his chair at one end o' th' table
had station; So sweet mistress may'ress, in just such another, Like the fair queen of hearts,
sat in state at the other; By which I perceived, though it seemed a riddle, The lower end of
this must be just in the middle: But perhaps 'tis a rule there, and one that would mind it
Amongst the town-statutes 'tis likely might find it. But now into the pottage each deep his
spoon claps, As in truth one might safely for burning one's chaps, When straight, with the
look and the tone of a scold, Mistress may'ress complained that the pottage was cold; 'And
all 'long of your fiddle-faddle,' quoth she. 'Why, what then, Goody Two-Shoes, what if it be?
Hold you, if you can, your tittle-tattle,' quoth he. I was glad she was snapped thus, and guessed
by th' discourse, The may'r, not the gray mare, was the better horse, And yet for all that,
there is reason to fear, She submitted but out of respect to his year: However 'twas well she
had now so much grace, Though not to the man, to submit to his place; For had she proceeded,
I verily thought My turn would the next be, for I was in fault: But this brush being past,
we fell to our diet, And every one there filled his belly in quiet. Supper being ended, and
things away taken, Master mayor's curiosity 'gan to awaken; Wherefore making me draw something
nearer his chair, He willed and required me there to declare My country, my birth, my estate,
and my parts, And whether I was not a master of arts; And eke what the business was had brought
me thither, With what I was going about now, and whither: Giving me caution, no lie should
escape me, For if I should trip, he should certainly trap me. I answered, my country was famed
Staffordshire; That in deeds, bills, and bonds, I was ever writ squire; That of land I had
both sorts, some good, and some evil, But that a great part on't was pawned to the devil; That
as for my parts, they were such as he saw; That, indeed, I had a small smatt'ring of law, Which
I lately had got more by practice than reading, By sitting o' th' bench, whilst others were
pleading; But that arms I had ever more studied than arts, And was now to a captain raised
by my deserts; That the business which led me through Palatine ground Into Ireland was, whither
now I was bound; Where his worship's great favour I loud will proclaim, And in all other places
wherever I came. He said, as to that, I might do what I list, But that I was welcome, and gave
me his fist; When having my fingers made crack with his gripes, He called to his man for some
bottles and pipes.

To trouble you here with a longer narration Of the several parts of our confabulation, Perhaps
would be tedious; I'll therefore remit ye Even to the most rev'rend records of the city, Where,
doubtless, the acts of the may'rs are recorded, And if not more truly, yet much better worded.

In short, then, we piped and we tippled Canary, Till my watch pointed one in the circle horary;
When thinking it now was high time to depart, His worship I thanked with a most grateful heart;
And because to great men presents are acceptable, I presented the may'r, ere I rose from the
table, With a certain fantastical box and a stopper; And he having kindly accepted my offer,
I took my fair leave, such my visage adorning, And to bed, for I was to rise early i' th' morning.

CANTO III.

The sun in the morning disclosed his light, With complexion as ruddy as mine over night; And
o'er th' eastern mountains peeping up's head, The casement being open, espied me in bed; With
his rays he so tickled my lids that I waked, And was half ashamed, for I found myself naked;
But up I soon start, and was dressed in a trice, And called for a draught of ale, sugar, and
spice; Which having turned off, I then call to pay, And packing my nawls, whipt to horse, and
away. A guide I had got, who demanded great vails, For conducting me over the mountains of
Wales: Twenty good shillings, which sure very large is; Yet that would not serve, but I must
bear his charges; And yet for all that, rode astride on a beast, The worst that e'er went on
three legs, I protest: It certainly was the most ugly of jades, His hips and his rump made
a right ace of spades; His sides were two ladders, well spur-galled withal; His neck was a
helve, and his head was a mall; For his colour, my pains and your trouble I'll spare, For the
creature was wholly denuded of hair; And, except for two things, as bare as my nail, A tuft
of a mane, and a sprig of a tail; And by these the true colour one can no more know, Than by
mouse-skins above stairs, the merkin below. Now such as the beast was, even such was the rider,
With a head like a nutmeg, and legs like a spider; A voice like a cricket, a look like a rat,
The brains of a goose, and the heart of a cat: Even such was my guide and his beast; let them
pass, The one for a horse, and the other an ass. But now with our horses, what sound and what
rotten, Down to the shore, you must know, we were gotten; And there we were told, it concerned
us to ride, Unless we did mean to encounter the tide; And then my guide lab'ring with heels
and with hands, With two up and one down, hopped over the sands, Till his horse, finding the
labour for three legs too sore, Foaled out a new leg, and then he had four: And now by plain
dint of hard spurring and whipping, Dry-shod we came where folks sometimes take shipping; And
where the salt sea, as the devil were in 't, Came roaring t' have hindered our journey to Flint;
But we, by good luck, before him got thither, He else would have carried us, no man knows whither.

And now her in Wales is, Saint Taph be her speed, Gott splutter her taste, some Welsh ale her
had need; For her ride in great haste, and    *     * For fear of her being catched up by the
fishes: But the lord of Flint castle's no lord worth a louse, For he keeps ne'er a drop of
good drink in his house; But in a small house near unto 't there was store Of such ale as,
thank God, I ne'er tasted before; And surely the Welsh are not wise of their fuddle, For this
had the taste and complexion of puddle. From thence then we marched, full as dry as we came,
My guide before prancing, his steed no more lame, O'er hills and o'er valleys uncouth and uneven,
Until 'twixt the hours of twelve and eleven, More hungry and thirsty than tongue can well tell,
We happily came to Saint Winifred's well: I thought it the pool of Bethesda had been, By the
cripples lay there; but I went to my inn To speak for some meat, for so stomach did motion,
Before I did further proceed in devotion: I went into th' kitchen, where victuals I saw, Both
beef, veal, and mutton, but all on 't was raw; And some on't alive, but soon went to slaughter,
For four chickens were slain by my dame and her daughter; Of which to Saint Win. ere my vows
I had paid, They said I should find a rare fricasee made: I thanked them, and straight to the
well did repair, Where some I found cursing, and others at prayer; Some dressing, some stripping,
some out and some in, Some naked, where botches and boils might be seen; Of which some were
fevers of Venus I'm sure, And therefore unfit for the virgin to cure: But the fountain, in
truth, is well worth the sight, The beautiful virgin's own tears not more bright; Nay, none
but she ever shed such a tear, Her conscience, her name, nor herself, were more clear. In the
bottom there lie certain stones that look white, But streaked with pure red, as the morning
with light, Which they say is her blood, and so it may be, But for that, let who shed it look
to it for me. Over the fountain a chapel there stands, Which I wonder has 'scaped master Oliver's
hands; The floor's not ill paved, and the margin o' th' spring Is inclosed with a certain octagonal
ring; From each angle of which a pillar does rise, Of strength and of thickness enough to suffice
To support and uphold from falling to ground A cupola wherewith the virgin is crowned. Now
'twixt the two angles that fork to the north, And where the cold nymph does her basin pour
forth, Under ground is a place where they bathe, as 'tis said, And 'tis true, for I heard folks'
teeth hack in their head; For you are to know, that the rogues and the * * Are not let to pollute
the spring-head with their sores. But one thing I chiefly admired in the place, That a saint
and a virgin endued with such grace, Should yet be so wonderful kind a well-willer To that
whoring and filching trade of a miller, As within a few paces to furnish the wheels Of I cannot
tell how many water-mills: I've studied that point much, you cannot guess why, But the virgin
was, doubtless, more righteous than I. And now for my welcome, four, five, or six lasses, With
as many crystalline liberal glasses, Did all importune me to drink of the water Of Saint Winifreda,
good Thewith's fair daughter. A while I was doubtful, and stood in a muse, Not knowing, amidst
all that choice, where to choose. Till a pair of black eyes, darting full in my sight, From
the rest o' th' fair maidens did carry me quite; I took the glass from her, and whip, off it
went, I half doubt I fancied a health to the saint: But he was a great villain committed the
slaughter, For Saint Winifred made most delicate water. I slipped a hard shilling into her
soft hand, Which had like to have made me the place have profaned; And giving two more to the
poor that were there, Did, sharp as a hawk, to my quarters repair.

My dinner was ready, and to it I fell, I never ate better meat, that I can tell; When having
half dined, there comes in my host, A catholic good, and a rare drunken toast; This man, by
his drinking, inflamed the scot, And told me strange stories, which I have forgot; But this
I remember, 'twas much on's own life, And one thing, that he had converted his wife.

But now my guide told me, it time was to go, For that to our beds we must both ride and row;
Wherefore calling to pay, and having accounted, I soon was down-stairs, and as suddenly mounted:
On then we travelled, our guide still before, Sometimes on three legs, and sometimes on four,
Coasting the sea, and over hills crawling, Sometimes on all four, for fear we should fall in;
For underneath Neptune lay skulking to watch us, And, had we but slipped once, was ready to
catch us. Thus in places of danger taking more heed, And in safer travelling mending our speed:
Redland Castle and Abergoney we past, And o'er against Connoway came at the last: Just over
against a castle there stood, O' th' right hand the town, and o' th' left hand a wood; 'Twixt
the wood and the castle they see at high water The storm, the place makes it a dangerous matter;
And besides, upon such a steep rock it is founded, As would break a man's neck, should he'scape
being drowned: Perhaps though in time one may make them to yield, But 'tis prettiest Cob-castle
e'er I beheld.

The sun now was going t' unharness his steeds, When the ferry-boat brasking her sides 'gainst
the weeds, Came in as good time as good time could be, To give us a cast o'er an arm of the
sea; And bestowing our horses before and abaft, O'er god Neptune's wide cod-piece gave us a
waft; Where scurvily landing at foot of the fort, Within very few paces we entered the port,
Where another King's Head invited me down, For indeed I have ever been true to the crown.

DR HENRY MORE.

This eminent man was the son of a gentleman of good family and estate in Grantham, Lincolnshire.
He was born in 1614. His father sent him to study at Eton, and thence, in 1631, he repaired
to Cambridge, where he was destined to spend the most of his life. Philosophy attracted him
early, in preference to science or literature, and he became a follower of Plato, so decided
and enthusiastic as to gain for himself the title of 'The Platonist' par excellence. In 1639,
he graduated M.A.; and the next year, he published the first part of 'Psychozoia; or, The Song
of the Soul,' containing a Christiano-Platonical account of Man and Life. In preparing the
materials of this poem, he had studied all the principal Platonists and mystical writers, and
is said to have read himself almost to a shadow. And not only was his body emaciated, but his
mind was so overstrung, that he imagined himself to see spiritual beings, to hear supernatural
voices, and to converse, like Socrates, with a particular genius. He thought, too, that his
body 'exhaled the perfume of violets!' Notwithstanding these little peculiarities, his genius
and his learning, the simplicity of his character, and the innocence of his life, rendered
him a general favourite; he was made a fellow of his college, and became a tutor to various
persons of distinguished rank. One of these was Sir John Finch, whose sister, Lady Conway,
an enthusiast herself, brought More acquainted with the famous John Baptist Van Helment, a
man after whom, in the beginning of the seventeenth century, the whole of Europe wondered.
He was a follower and imitator of Paracelsus, like him affected universal knowledge, aspired
to revolutionise the science of medicine, and died with the reputation of one who, with great
powers and acquirements, instead of becoming a great man, ended as a brilliant pretender, and
was rather an 'architect of ruin' to the systems of others, than the founder of a solid fabric
of his own. More admired, of course, not the quackery, but the adventurous boldness of Helment's
genius, and his devotion to chemistry; which is certainly the most spiritual of all the sciences,
and must, especially in its transcendental forms, have had a great charm for a Platonic thinker.
Our author was entirely devoted to study, and resisted every inducement to leave what he called
his 'Paradise' at Cambridge. His friends once tried to decoy him into a bishopric, and got
him the length of Whitehall to kiss the king's hand on the occasion; but when he understood
their purpose, he refused to go a single step further. His life was a long, learned, happy,
and holy dream. Thou were they had cheered to look i did not chide me! they have plated. All the

ON GOMBAULD'S ENDYMION.

I've read thy soul's fair night-piece, and have seen The amours and courtship of the silent
queen; Her stolen descents to earth, and what did move her To juggle first with heaven, then
with a lover; With Latmos' louder rescue, and, alas! To find her out, a hue and cry in brass;
Thy journal of deep mysteries, and sad Nocturnal pilgrimage; with thy dreams, clad In fancies
darker than thy cave; thy glass Of sleepy draughts; and as thy soul did pass In her calm voyage,
what discourse she heard Of spirits; what dark groves and ill-shaped guard Ismena led thee
through; with thy proud flight O'er Periardes, and deep-musing night Near fair Eurotas' banks;
what solemn green The neighbour shades wear; and what forms are seen In their large bowers;
with that sad path and seat Which none but light-heeled nymphs and fairies beat, Their solitary
life, and how exempt From common frailty, the severe contempt They have of man, their privilege
to live A tree or fountain, and in that reprieve What ages they consume: with the sad vale
Of Diophania; and the mournful tale Of the bleeding, vocal myrtle:--these and more, Thy richer
thoughts, we are upon the score To thy rare fancy for. Nor dost thou fall From thy first majesty,
or ought at all Betray consumption. Thy full vigorous bays Wear the same green, and scorn the
lean decays Of style or matter; just as I have known Some crystal spring, that from the neighbour
down Derived her birth, in gentle murmurs steal To the next vale, and proudly there reveal
Her streams in louder accents, adding still More noise and waters to her channel, till At last,
swollen with increase, she glides along The lawns and meadows, in a wanton throng Of frothy
billows, and in one great name Swallows the tributary brooks' drowned fame. Nor are they mere
inventions, for we In the same piece find scattered philosophy, And hidden, dispersed truths,
that folded lie In the dark shades of deep allegory, So neatly weaved, like arras, they descry
Fables with truth, fancy with history. So that thou hast, in this thy curious mould, Cast that
commended mixture wished of old, Which shall these contemplations render far Less mutable,
and lasting as their star; And while there is a people, or a sun, Endymion's story with the
moon shall run.

APOSTROPHE TO FLETCHER THE DRAMATIST.

I did believe, great Beaumont being dead, Thy widowed muse slept on his flowery bed. But I
am richly cozened, and can see Wit transmigrates--his spirit stayed with thee; Which, doubly
advantaged by thy single pen, In life and death now treads the stage again. And thus are we
freed from that dearth of wit Which starved the land, since into schisms split, Wherein th'
hast done so much, we must needs guess Wit's last edition is now i' the press. For thou hast
drained invention, and he That writes hereafter, doth but pillage thee. But thou hast plots;
and will not the Kirk strain At the designs of such a tragic brain? Will they themselves think
safe, when they shall see Thy most abominable policy? Will not the Ears assemble, and think't
fit Their synod fast and pray against thy wit? But they'll not tire in such an idle quest--
Thou dost but kill and circumvent in jest; And when thy angered muse swells to a blow, Tis
but for Field's or Swansteed's overthrow. Yet shall these conquests of thy bays outlive Their
Scottish zeal, and compacts made to grieve The peace of spirits; and when such deeds fail Of
their foul ends, a fair name is thy bail. But, happy! thou ne'er saw'st these storms our air
Teemed with, even in thy time, though seeming fair. Thy gentle soul, meant for the shade and
ease Withdrew betimes into the land of peace. So, nested in some hospitable shore, The hermit-angler,
when the mid seas roar, Packs up his lines, and ere the tempest raves, Retires, and leaves
his station to the waves. Thus thou diedst almost with our peace; and we, This breathing time,
thy last fair issue see, Which I think such, if needless ink not soil So choice a muse, others
are but thy foil; This or that age may write, but never see A wit that dares run parallel with
thee. True Ben must live; but bate him, and thou hast Undone all future wits, and matched the past.

PICTURE OF THE TOWN.

Abominable face of things!--here's noise Of banged mortars, blue aprons, and boys, Pigs, dogs,
and drums; with the hoarse, hellish notes Of politicly-deaf usurers' throats; With new fine
worships, and the old cast team Of justices, vexed with the cough and phlegm. 'Midst these,
the cross looks sad; and in the shire- Hall furs of an old Saxon fox appear, With brotherly
rufts and beards, and a strange sight Of high, monumental hats, ta'en at the fight Of Eighty-eight;
while every burgess foots The mortal pavement in eternal boots. Hadst thou been bachelor, I
had soon divined Thy close retirements, and monastic mind; Perhaps some nymph had been to visit;
or The beauteous churl was to be waited for, And, like the Greek, ere you the sport would miss,
You stayed and stroked the distaff for a kiss.

       *       *       *       *       *

Why, two months hence, if thou continue thus, Thy memory will scarce remain with us. The drawers
have forgot thee, and exclaim They have not seen thee here since Charles' reign; Or, if they
mention thee, like some old man That at each word inserts--Sir, as I can Remember--so the cipherers
puzzle me With a dark, cloudy character of thee; That, certes, I fear thou wilt be lost, and
we Must ask the fathers ere't be long for thee. Come! leave this sullen state, and let not
wine And precious wit lie dead for want of thine. Shall the dull market landlord, with his
rout Of sneaking tenants, dirtily swill out This harmless liquor shall they knock and beat
For sack, only to talk of rye and wheat? Oh, let not such preposterous tippling be; In our
metropolis, may I ne'er see Such tavern sacrilege, nor lend a line To weep the rapes and tragedy
of wine! Here lives that chemic quick-fire, which betrays Fresh spirits to the blood, and warms
our lays; I have reserved, 'gainst thy approach, a cup, That, were thy muse stark dead, should
raise her up, And teach her yet more charming words and skill, Than ever Coelia, Chloris, Astrophil,
Or any of the threadbare names inspired Poor rhyming lovers, with a mistress fired. Come, then,
and while the snow-icicle hangs At the stiff thatch, and winter's frosty fangs Benumb the year,
blithe as of old, let us, 'Midst noise and war, of peace and mirth discuss. This portion thou
wert born for: why should we Vex at the times' ridiculous misery? An age that thus hath fooled
itself, and will, Spite of thy teeth and mine, persist so still. Let's sit, then, at this fire,
and while we steal A revel in the town, let others seal, Purchase, or cheat, and who can, let
them pay, Till those black deeds bring on a darksome day. Innocent spenders we! A better use
Shall wear out our short lease, and leave th' obtuse Rout to their husks: they and their bags,
at best, Have cares in earnest--we care for a jest.

THE GOLDEN AGE.

Happy that first white age! when we Lived by the earth's mere charity; No soft luxurious diet
then Had effeminated men-- No other meat nor wine had any Than the coarse mast, or simple honey;
And, by the parents' care laid up, Cheap berries did the children sup. No pompous wear was
in those days, Of gummy silks, or scarlet baize. Their beds were on some flowery brink, And
clear spring water was their drink. The shady pine, in the sun's heat, Was their cool and known
retreat; For then 'twas not cut down, but stood The youth and glory of the wood. The daring
sailor with his slaves Then had not cut the swelling waves, Nor, for desire of foreign store,
Seen any but his native shore. No stirring drum had scared that age, Nor the shrill trumpet's
active rage; No wounds, by bitter hatred made, With warm blood soiled the shining blade; For
how could hostile madness arm An age of love to public harm, When common justice none withstood,
Nor sought rewards for spilling blood? Oh that at length our age would raise Into the temper
of those days! But--worse than Aetna's fires!--debate And avarice inflame our state. Alas!
who was it that first found Gold hid of purpose under ground-- That sought out pearls, and
dived to find Such precious perils for mankind?

REGENERATION.

1  A ward, and still in bonds, one day
                 I stole abroad;
   It was high spring, and all the way
          Primrosed, and hung with shade;
          Yet was it frost within,
                 And surly wind
   Blasted my infant buds, and sin,
          Like clouds, eclipsed my mind.

2  Stormed thus, I straight perceived my spring
                 Mere stage and show,
   My walk a monstrous, mountained thing,
          Rough-cast with rocks and snow;
          And as a pilgrim's eye,
                 Far from relief,
   Measures the melancholy sky,
          Then drops, and rains for grief,

3  So sighed I upwards still; at last,
                 'Twixt steps and falls,
   I reached the pinnacle, where placed
          I found a pair of scales;
          I took them up, and laid
                 In the one late pains,
   The other smoke and pleasures weighed,
          But proved the heavier grains.

4  With that some cried, Away; straight I
                 Obeyed, and led
   Full east, a fair, fresh field could spy--
          Some called it Jacob's Bed--
          A virgin soil, which no
                 Rude feet e'er trod,
   Where, since he stept there, only go
          Prophets and friends of God.

5  Here I reposed, but scarce well set,
                 A grove descried
   Of stately height, whose branches met
          And mixed on every side;
          I entered, and, once in,
                 (Amazed to see 't;)
   Found all was changed, and a new spring
          Did all my senses greet.

6  The unthrift sun shot vital gold
                 A thousand pieces,
   And heaven its azure did unfold,
          Chequered with snowy fleeces.
          The air was all in spice,
                 And every bush
   A garland wore; thus fed my eyes,
          But all the ear lay hush.

7  Only a little fountain lent
                 Some use for ears,
   And on the dumb shades language spent,
          The music of her tears;
          I drew her near, and found
                 The cistern full
   Of divers stones, some bright and round,
          Others ill-shaped and dull.

8  The first, (pray mark,) as quick as light
                 Danced through the flood;
   But the last, more heavy than the night,
          Nailed to the centre stood;
          I wondered much, but tired
                 At last with thought,
     My restless eye, that still desired,
          As strange an object brought.

9  It was a bank of flowers, where I descried
                 (Though 'twas mid-day)
   Some fast asleep, others broad-eyed
          And taking in the ray;
          Here musing long I heard
                 A rushing wind,
   Which still increased, but whence it stirred,
          Nowhere I could not find.

10 I turned me round, and to each shade
                 Despatched an eye,
   To see if any leaf had made
          Least motion or reply;
          But while I, listening, sought
                 My mind to ease
   By knowing where 'twas, or where not,
          It whispered, 'Where I please.'

  'Lord,' then said I, 'on me one breath,
  And let me die before my death!'

'Arise, O north, and come, thou south wind; and blow upon my garden, that the spices thereof
may flow out.'--CANT. iv. 16.

RESURRECTION AND IMMORTALITY.

'By that new and living way, which he hath prepared for us, through the veil, which is his
flesh.'--HEB. x. 20.

BODY.

1 Oft have I seen, when that renewing breath
                That binds and loosens death
  Inspired a quickening power through the dead
                Creatures abed,
            Some drowrsy silk-worm creep
                From that long sleep,
  And in weak, infant hummings chime and knell
            About her silent cell,
  Until at last, full with the vital ray,
                She winged away,
            And, proud with life and sense,
                Heaven's rich expense,
  Esteemed (vain things!) of two whole elements
            As mean, and span-extents.
  Shall I then think such providence will be
                Less friend to me,
    Or that he can endure to be unjust
    Who keeps his covenant even with our dust?

SOUL

2 Poor querulous handful! was't for this
                I taught thee all that is?
  Unbowelled nature, showed thee her recruits,
                And change of suits,
            And how of death we make
                A mere mistake;
  For no thing can-to nothing fall, but still
            Incorporates by skill,
  And then returns, and from the womb of things
                Such treasure brings,
            As pheenix-like renew'th
                Both life and youth;
  For a preserving spirit doth still pass
            Untainted through this mass,
  Which doth resolve, produce, and ripen all
                That to it fall;
            Nor are those births, which we
                Thus suffering see,
  Destroyed at all; but when time's restless wave
            Their substance doth deprave,
  And the more noble essence finds his house
                Sickly and loose,
            He, ever young, doth wing
                Unto that spring
  And source of spirits, where he takes his lot,
            Till time no more shall rot
  His passive cottage; which, (though laid aside,)
                Like some spruce bride,
  Shall one day rise, and, clothed with shining light,
                All pure and bright,
    Remarry to the soul, for'tis most plain
    Thou only fall'st to be refined again.

3 Then I that here saw darkly in a glass
                But mists and shadows pass,
  And, by their own weak shine, did search the springs
                And course of things,
           Shall with enlightened rays
                Pierce all their ways;
  And as thou saw'st, I in a thought could go
           To heaven or earth below,
  To read some star, or mineral, and in state
                There often sate;
              So shalt thou then with me,
                Both winged and free,
  Rove in that mighty and eternal light,
           Where no rude shade or night
  Shall dare approach us; we shall there no more
                Watch stars, or pore
           Through melancholy clouds, and say,
                'Would it were day!'
    One everlasting Sabbath there shall run
    Without succession, and without a sun. 13.

THE SEARCH.

'Tis now clear day: I see a rose Bud in the bright east, and disclose The pilgrim-sun. All
night have I Spent in a roving ecstasy To find my Saviour. I have been As far as Bethlehem,
and have seen His inn and cradle; being there I met the wise men, asked them where He might
be found, or what star can Now point him out, grown up a man? To Egypt hence I fled, ran o'er
All her parched bosom to Nile's shore, Her yearly nurse; came back, inquired Amongst the doctors,
and desired To see the temple, but was shown A little dust, and for the town A heap of ashes,
where, some said, A small bright sparkle was abed, Which would one day (beneath the pole) Awake,
and then refine the whole.

Tired here, I came to Sychar, thence To Jacob's well, bequeathed since Unto his sons, where
often they, In those calm, golden evenings, lay Watering their flocks, and having spent Those
white days, drove home to the tent Their well-fleeced train; and here (O fate!) I sit where
once my Saviour sate. The angry spring in bubbles swelled, Which broke in sighs still, as they
filled, And whispered, Jesus had been there, But Jacob's children would not hear. Loth hence
to part, at last I rise, But with the fountain in mine eyes, And here a fresh search is decreed:
He must be found where he did bleed. I walk the garden, and there see Ideas of his agony, And
moving anguishments, that set His blest face in a bloody sweat; I climbed the hill, perused
the cross, Hung with my gain, and his great loss: Never did tree bear fruit like this, Balsam
of souls, the body's bliss. But, O his grave! where I saw lent (For he had none) a monument,
An undefiled, a new-hewed one, But there was not the Corner-stone. Sure then, said I, my quest
is vain, He'll not be found where he was slain; So mild a Lamb can never be 'Midst so much
blood and cruelty. I'll to the wilderness, and can Find beasts more merciful than man; He lived
there safe, 'twas his retreat From the fierce Jew, and Herod's heat, And forty days withstood
the fell And high temptations of hell; With seraphim there talked he, His Father's flaming
ministry, He heavened their walks, and with his eyes Made those wild shades a paradise. Thus
was the desert sanctified To be the refuge of his bride. I'll thither then; see, it is day!
The sun's broke through to guide my way.

But as I urged thus, and writ down What pleasures should my journey crown, What silent paths,
what shades and cells, Fair virgin-flowers and hallowed wells, I should rove in, and rest my
head Where my dear Lord did often tread, Sugaring all dangers with success, Methought I heard
one singing thus:

1 Leave, leave thy gadding thoughts;
         Who pores
         And spies
    Still out of doors,
         Descries
    Within them nought.

2 The skin and shell of things,
         Though fair,
         Are not
    Thy wish nor prayer,
         But got
    By mere despair
         Of wings.

3 To rack old elements,
         Or dust,
         And say,
    Sure here he must
         Needs stay,
    Is not the way,
         Nor just.

Search well another world; who studies this, Travels in clouds, seeks manna where none is.

'That they should seek the Lord, if haply they might feel after him, and find him, though he
be not far off from every one of us: for in him we live, and move, and have our being.'--ACTS
xvii. 27, 28.

ISAAC'S MARRIAGE.

'And Isaac went out to pray in the field at the eventide, and he lifted up his eyes, and saw,
and, behold, the camels were coming.' --GEN. xxiv. 63.

Praying! and to be married! It was rare, But now 'tis monstrous; and that pious care Though
of ourselves, is so much out of date, That to renew't were to degenerate. But thou a chosen
sacrifice wert given, And offered up so early unto Heaven, Thy flames could not be out; religion
was Hayed into thee like beams into a glass; Where, as thou grew'st, it multiplied, and shined
The sacred constellation of thy mind.

But being for a bride, prayer was such A decried course, sure it prevailed not much. Hadst
ne'er an oath nor compliment? thou wert An odd, dull suitor; hadst thou but the art Of these
our days, thou couldst have coined thee twenty New several oaths, and compliments, too, plenty.
O sad and wild excess! and happy those White days, that durst no impious mirth expose: When
conscience by lewd use had not lost sense, Nor bold-faced custom banished innocence! Thou hadst
no pompous train, nor antic crowd Of young, gay swearers, with their needless, loud Retinue;
all was here smooth as thy bride, And calm like her, or that mild evening-tide. Yet hadst thou
nobler guests: angels did wind And rove about thee, guardians of thy mind; These fetched thee
home thy bride, and all the way Advised thy servant what to do and say; These taught him at
the well, and thither brought The chaste and lovely object of thy thought. But here was ne'er
a compliment, not one Spruce, supple cringe, or studied look put on. All was plain, modest
truth: nor did she come In rolls and curls, mincing and stately dumb; But in a virgin's native
blush and fears, Fresh as those roses which the day-spring wears. O sweet, divine simplicity!
O grace Beyond a curled lock or painted face! A pitcher too she had, nor thought it much To
carry that, which some would scorn to touch; With, which in mild, chaste language she did woo
To draw him drink, and for his camels too.

And now thou knew'st her coming, it was time To get thee wings on, and devoutly climb Unto
thy God; for marriage of all states Makes most unhappy, or most fortunates. This brought thee
forth, where now thou didst undress Thy soul, and with new pinions refresh Her wearied wings,
which, so restored, did fly Above the stars, a track unknown and high; And in her piercing
flight perfumed the air, Scattering the myrrh and incense of thy prayer. So from Lahai-roi[1]'s
well some spicy cloud, Wooed by the sun, swells up to be his shroud, And from her moist womb
weeps a fragrant shower, Which, scattered in a thousand pearls, each flower And herb partakes;
where having stood awhile, And something cooled the parched and thirsty isle, The thankful
earth unlocks herself, and blends A thousand odours, which, all mixed, she sends Up in one
cloud, and so returns the skies That dew they lent, a breathing sacrifice.

Thus soared thy soul, who, though young, didst inherit Together with his blood thy father's
spirit, Whose active zeal and tried faith were to thee Familiar ever since thy infancy. Others
were timed and trained up to't, but thou Didst thy swift years in piety outgrow. Age made them
reverend and a snowy head, But thou wert so, ere time his snow could shed. Then who would truly
limn thee out must paint First a young patriarch, then a married saint.

[1] 'Lahai-roi:' a well in the south country where Jacob dwelt, between Kadesh and Bered; Heb.,
The well of him that liveth and seeth me.

MAN'S FALL AND RECOVERY.

Farewell, you everlasting hills! I'm cast
Here under clouds, where storms and tempests blast
            This sullied flower,
Robbed of your calm; nor can I ever make,
Transplanted thus, one leaf of his t'awake;
            But every hour
He sleeps and droops; and in this drowsy state
Leaves me a slave to passions and my fate.
            Besides I've lost
A train of lights, which in those sunshine days
Were my sure guides; and only with me stays,
            Unto my cost,
One sullen beam, whose charge is to dispense
More punishment than knowledge to my sense.
            Two thousand years
I sojourned thus. At last Jeshurun's king
Those famous tables did from Sinai bring.
            These swelled my fears,
Guilts, trespasses, and all this inward awe;
For sin took strength and vigour from the law.
            Yet have I found
A plenteous way, (thanks to that Holy One!)
To cancel all that e'er was writ in stone.
            His saving wound
Wept blood that broke this adamant, and gave
To sinners confidence, life to the grave.
            This makes me span
My fathers' journeys, and in one fair step
O'er all their pilgrimage and labours leap.
            For God, made man,
Reduced the extent of works of faith; so made
Of their Red Sea a spring: I wash, they wade.

'As by the offence of one the fault came on all men to condemnation; so by the righteousness
of one, the benefit abounded towards all men to the justification of life.'--ROM. v. 18.

THE SHOWER.

1 'Twas so; I saw thy birth. That drowsy lake
  From her faint bosom breathed thee, the disease
  Of her sick waters, and infectious ease.
                  But now at even,
                  Too gross for heaven,
  Thou fall'st in tears, and weep'st for thy mistake.

2 Ah! it is so with me; oft have I pressed
  Heaven with a lazy breath; but fruitless this
  Pierced not; love only can with quick access
                  Unlock the way,
                  When all else stray,
  The smoke and exhalations of the breast.

3 Yet if, as thou dost melt, and, with thy train
  Of drops, make soft the earth, my eyes could weep
  O'er my hard heart, that's bound up and asleep,
                  Perhaps at last,
                  Some such showers past,
  My God would give a sunshine after rain.

BURIAL.

1 O thou! the first-fruits of the dead,
            And their dark bed,
  When I am cast into that deep
            And senseless sleep,
          The wages of my sin,
                   O then,
  Thou great Preserver of all men,
            Watch o'er that loose
            And empty house,
          Which I sometime lived in!

2 It is in truth a ruined piece,
            Not worth thy eyes;
  And scarce a room, but wind and rain
            Beat through and stain
          The seats and cells within;
                   Yet thou,
  Led by thy love, wouldst stoop thus low,
            And in this cot,
            All filth and spot,
          Didst with thy servant inn.

3 And nothing can, I hourly see,
            Drive thee from me.
  Thou art the same, faithful and just,
            In life or dust.
          Though then, thus crumbed, I stray
                   In blasts,
  Or exhalations, and wastes,
            Beyond all eyes,
            Yet thy love spies
          That change, and knows thy clay.

4 The world's thy box: how then, there tossed,
            Can I be lost?
  But the delay is all; Time now
            Is old and slow;
          His wings are dull and sickly.
                   Yet he
  Thy servant is, and waits on thee.
            Cut then the sum,
            Lord, haste, Lord, come,
          O come, Lord Jesus, quickly! 23.

CHEERFULNESS.

1 Lord, with what courage and delight
         I do each thing,
  When thy least breath sustains my wing!
         I shine and move
         Like those above,
         And, with much gladness
         Quitting sadness,
  Make me fair days of every night.

2 Affliction thus mere pleasure is;
         And hap what will,
  If thou be in't,'tis welcome still.
         But since thy rays
         In sunny days
         Thou dost thus lend,
         And freely spend,
  Ah! what shall I return for this?

3 Oh that I were all soul! that thou
         Wouldst make each part
  Of this poor sinful frame pure heart!
         Then would I drown
         My single one;
         And to thy praise
         A concert raise
  Of hallelujahs here below.

THE PASSION.

1           O my chief good!
            My dear, dear God!
            When thy blest blood
  Did issue forth, forced by the rod,
            What pain didst thou
            Feel in each blow!
            How didst thou weep,
            And thyself steep
  In thy own precious, saving tears!
            What cruel smart
            Did tear thy heart!
            How didst thou groan it
            In the spirit,
  O thou whom my soul loves and fears!

2           Most blessed Vine!
            Whose juice so good
            I feel as wine,
  But thy fair branches felt as blood,
            How wert thou pressed
            To be my feast!
            In what deep anguish
            Didst thou languish!
  What springs of sweat and blood did drown thee!
            How in one path
            Did the full wrath
            Of thy great Father
            Crowd and gather,
  Doubling thy griefs, when none would own thee!

3           How did the weight
            Of all our sins,
            And death unite
  To wrench and rack thy blessed limbs!
            How pale and bloody
            Looked thy body!
            How bruised and broke,
            With every stroke!
  How meek and patient was thy spirit!
            How didst thou cry,
            And groan on high,
            'Father, forgive,
            And let them live!
  I die to make my foes inherit!'

4           O blessed Lamb!
            That took'st my sin,
            That took'st my shame,
  How shall thy dust thy praises sing?
            I would I were
            One hearty tear!
            One constant spring!
            Then would I bring
  Thee two small mites, and be at strife
            Which should most vie,
            My heart or eye,
            Teaching my years
            In smiles and tears
  To weep, to sing, thy death, my life.

RULES AND LESSONS.

1  When first thy eyes unvail, give thy soul leave
   To do the like; our bodies but forerun
   The spirit's duty. True hearts spread and heave
   Unto their God, as flowers do to the sun.
     Give him thy first thoughts then; so shalt thou keep
     Him company all day, and in him sleep.

2  Yet never sleep the sun up. Prayer should
   Dawn with the day. There are set, awful hours
   'Twixt Heaven and us. The manna was not good
   After sun-rising; far-day sullies flowers.
     Rise to prevent the sun; sleep doth sins glut,
     And heaven's gate opens when this world's is shut.

3  Walk with thy fellow-creatures; note the hush
   And whispers amongst them. There's not a spring
   Or leaf but hath his morning-hymn. Each bush
   And oak doth know I AM. Canst thou not sing?
     Oh, leave thy cares and follies! go this way,
     And thou art sure to prosper all the day.

4  Serve God before the world; let him not go
   Until thou hast a blessing; then resign
   The whole unto him, and remember who
   Prevailed by wrestling ere the sun did shine;
     Pour oil upon the stones; weep for thy sin;
     Then journey on, and have an eye to heaven.

5  Mornings are mysteries; the first world's youth,
   Man's resurrection and the future's bud
   Shroud in their births; the crown of life, light, truth
   Is styled their star, the stone, and hidden food.
     Three blessings wait upon them, two of which
     Should move. They make us holy, happy, rich.

6  When the world's up, and every swarm abroad,
   Keep thou thy temper; mix not with each clay;
   Despatch necessities; life hath a load
   Which must be carried on, and safely may.
     Yet keep those cares without thee, let the heart
     Be God's alone, and choose the better part.

7  Through all thy actions, counsels, and discourse,
   Let mildness and religion guide thee out;
   If truth be thine, what needs a brutish force?
   But what's not good and just ne'er go about.
     Wrong not thy conscience for a rotten stick;
     That gain is dreadful which makes spirits sick.

8  To God, thy country, and thy friend be true;
   If priest and people change, keep thou thy ground.
   Who sells religion is a Judas Jew;
   And, oaths once broke, the soul cannot be sound.
     The perjurer's a devil let loose: what can
     Tie up his hands that dares mock God and man?

9  Seek not the same steps with the crowd; stick thou
   To thy sure trot; a constant, humble mind
   Is both his own joy, and his Maker's too;
   Let folly dust it on, or lag behind.
      A sweet self-privacy in a right soul
      Outruns the earth, and lines the utmost pole.

10 To all that seek thee bear an open heart;
   Make not thy breast a labyrinth or trap;
   If trials come, this will make good thy part,
   For honesty is safe, come what can hap;
     It is the good man's feast, the prince of flowers,
     Which thrives in storms, and smells best after showers.

11 Seal not thy eyes up from the poor, but give
   Proportion to their merits, and thy purse;
   Thou may'st in rags a mighty prince relieve,
   Who, when thy sins call for't, can fence a curse.
     Thou shalt not lose one mite. Though waters stray,
     The bread we cast returns in fraughts one day.

12 Spend not an hour so as to weep another,
   For tears are not thine own; if thou giv'st words,
   Dash not with them thy friend, nor Heaven; oh, smother
   A viperous thought; some syllables are swords.
     Unbitted tongues are in their penance double;
     They shame their owners, and their hearers trouble.

13 Injure not modest blood, while spirits rise
   In judgment against lewdness; that's base wit
   That voids but filth and stench. Hast thou no prize
   But sickness or infection? stifle it.
     Who makes his jest of sins, must be at least,
     If not a very devil, worse than beast.

14 Yet fly no friend, if he be such indeed;
   But meet to quench his longings, and thy thirst;
   Allow your joys, religion: that done, speed,
   And bring the same man back thou wert at first.
     Who so returns not, cannot pray aright,
     But shuts his door, and leaves God out all night.

15 To heighten thy devotions, and keep low
   All mutinous thoughts, what business e'er thou hast,
   Observe God in his works; here fountains flow,
   Birds sing, beasts feed, fish leap, and the earth stands fast;
     Above are restless motions, running lights,
     Vast circling azure, giddy clouds, days, nights.

16 When seasons change, then lay before thine eyes
   His wondrous method; mark the various scenes
   In heaven; hail, thunder, rainbows, snow, and ice,
   Calms, tempests, light, and darkness, by his means;
     Thou canst not miss his praise; each tree, herb, flower
     Are shadows of his wisdom and his power.

17 To meals when thou dost come, give him the praise
   Whose arm supplied thee; take what may suffice,
   And then be thankful; oh, admire his ways
   Who fills the world's unemptied granaries!
     A thankless feeder is a thief, his feast
     A very robbery, and himself no guest.

18 High-noon thus past, thy time decays; provide
   Thee other thoughts; away with friends and mirth;
   The sun now stoops, and hastes his beams to hide
   Under the dark and melancholy earth.
      All but preludes thy end. Thou art the man
      Whose rise, height, and descent is but a span.

19 Yet, set as he doth, and 'tis well. Have all
   Thy beams home with thee: trim thy lamp, buy oil,
   And then set forth; who is thus dressed, the fall
   Furthers his glory, and gives death the foil.
     Man is a summer's day; whose youth and fire
     Cool to a glorious evening, and expire.

20 When night comes, list[1] thy deeds; make plain the way
   'Twixt heaven and thee; block it not with delays;
   But perfect all before thou sleep'st; then say
   'There's one sun more strung on my bead of days.'
     What's good score up for joy; the bad, well scanned,
     Wash off with tears, and get thy Master's hand.

21 Thy accounts thus made, spend in the grave one hour
   Before thy time; be not a stranger there,
   Where thou may'st sleep whole ages; life's poor flower
   Lasts not a night sometimes. Bad spirits fear
     This conversation; but the good man lies
     Entombed many days before he dies.

22 Being laid, and dressed for sleep, close not thy eyes
   Up with thy curtains; give thy soul the wing
   In some good thoughts; so, when the day shall rise,
   And thou unrak'st thy fire, those sparks will bring
     New flames; besides where these lodge, vain heats mourn
     And die; that bush where God is shall not burn.

23 When thy nap's over, stir thy fire, and rake
   In that dead age; one beam i' the dark outvies
   Two in the day; then from the damps and ache
   Of night shut up thy leaves; be chaste; God pries
     Through thickest nights; though then the sun be far,
     Do thou the works of day, and rise a star.

24 Briefly, do as thou wouldst be done unto,
   Love God, and love thy neighbour; watch and pray.
   These are the words and works of life; this do,
   And live; who doth not thus, hath lost heaven's way.
     Oh, lose it not! look up, wilt change those lights
     For chains of darkness and eternal nights?

REPENTANCE.

Lord, since thou didst in this vile clay
          That sacred ray,
Thy Spirit, plant, quickening the whole
  With that one grain's infused wealth,
My forward flesh crept on, and subtly stole
  Both growth and power; checking the health
And heat of thine. That little gate
  And narrow way, by which to thee
The passage is, he termed a grate
  And entrance to captivity;
Thy laws but nets, where some small birds,
  And those but seldom too, were caught;
Thy promises but empty words,
  Which none but children heard or taught.
This I believed: and though a friend
  Came oft from far, and whispered, No;
Yet, that not sorting to my end,
  I wholly listened to my foe.
Wherefore, pierced through with grief, my sad,
  Seduced soul sighs up to thee;
To thee, who with true light art clad,
  And seest all things just as they be.
Look from thy throne upon this roll
  Of heavy sins, my high transgressions,
Which I confess with all my soul;
  My God, accept of my confession!
          It was last day,
Touched with the guilt of my own way,
I sat alone, and taking up,
          The bitter cup,
Through all thy fair and various store,
Sought out what might outvie my score.
  The blades of grass thy creatures feeding;
  The trees, their leaves; the flowers, their seeding;
  The dust, of which I am a part;
  The stones, much softer than my heart;
  The drops of rain, the sighs of wind,
  The stars, to which I am stark blind;
  The dew thy herbs drink up by night,
  The beams they warm them at i' the light;
  All that have signature or life
  I summoned to decide this strife;
  And lest I should lack for arrears,
  A spring ran by, I told her tears;
  But when these came unto the scale,
  My sins alone outweighed them all. ",

  Whose hand so shines through all this frame,
  That by the beauty of the seat,
  We plainly see who made the same,
      Seeing thy seed abides in me,
      Dwell thou in it, and I in thee!

5 To sleep without thee is to die;
  Yea,'tis a death partakes of hell:
  For where thou dost not close the eye
  It never opens, I can tell.
      In such a dark, Egyptian border,
      The shades of death dwell, and disorder.

6 If joys, and hopes, and earnest throes,
  And hearts, whose pulse beats still for light,
  Are given to birds; who, but thee, knows
  A love-sick soul's exalted flight?
      Can souls be tracked by any eye
      But his, who gave them wings to fly?

7 Only this veil which thou hast broke,
  And must be broken yet in me,
  This veil, I say, is all the cloak
  And cloud which shadows me from thee.
      This veil thy full-eyed love denies,
      And only gleams and fractions spies.

8 Oh, take it off! make no delay;
  But brush me with thy light, that I
  May shine unto a perfect day,
  And warm me at thy glorious eye!
      Oh, take it off! or till it flee,
      Though with no lily, stay with me!

THE PALM-TREE.

1 Dear friend, sit down, and bear awhile this shade,
  As I have yours long since. This plant you see
  So pressed and bowed, before sin did degrade
  Both you and it, had equal liberty

2 With other trees; but now, shut from the breath
  And air of Eden, like a malcontent
  It thrives nowhere. This makes these weights, like death
  And sin, hang at him; for the more he's bent

3 The more he grows. Celestial natures still
  Aspire for home. This Solomon of old,
  By flowers, and carvings, and mysterious skill
  Of wings, and cherubims, and palms, foretold.

4 This is the life which, hid above with Christ
  In God, doth always (hidden) multiply,
  And spring, and grow, a tree ne'er to be priced,
  A tree whose fruit is immortality.

5 Here spirits that have run their race, and fought,
  And won the fight, and have not feared the frowns
  Nor loved the smiles of greatness, but have wrought
  Their Master's will, meet to receive their crowns.

6 Here is the patience of the saints: this tree
  Is watered by their tears, as flowers are fed
  With dew by night; but One you cannot see
  Sits here, and numbers all the tears they shed.

7 Here is their faith too, which if you will keep
  When we two part, I will a journey make
  To pluck a garland hence while you do sleep,
  And weave it for your head against you wake.

THE GARLAND.

1 Thou, who dost flow and flourish here below,
  To whom a falling star and nine days' glory,
  Or some frail beauty, makes the bravest show,
  Hark, and make use of this ensuing story.

      When first my youthful, sinful age
            Grew master of my ways,
      Appointing error for my page,
            And darkness for my days;
      I flung away, and with full cry
            Of wild affections, rid
      In post for pleasures, bent to try
            All gamesters that would bid.
      I played with fire, did counsel spurn,
            Made life my common stake;
      But never thought that fire would burn,
            Or that a soul could ache.
      Glorious deceptions, gilded mists,
            False joys, fantastic flights,
      Pieces of sackcloth with silk lists,
            These were my prime delights.
      I sought choice bowers, haunted the spring,
            Culled flowers and made me posies;
      Gave my fond humours their full wing,
            And crowned my head with roses.
      But at the height of this career
            I met with a dead man,
      Who, noting well my vain abear,
            Thus unto me began:
      'Desist, fond fool, be not undone;
            What thou hast cut to-day
      Will fade at night, and with this sun
            Quite vanish and decay.'

2 Flowers gathered in this world, die here; if thou
  Wouldst have a wreath that fades not, let them grow,
  And grow for thee. Who spares them here, shall find
  A garland, where comes neither rain nor wind.

LOVE-SICK.

Jesus, my life! how shall I truly love thee! Oh that thy Spirit would so strongly move me,
That thou wert pleased to shed thy grace so far As to make man all pure love, flesh a star!
A star that would ne'er set, but ever rise, So rise and run, as to outrun these skies, These
narrow skies (narrow to me) that bar, So bar me in, that I am still at war, At constant war
with them. Oh, come, and rend Or bow the heavens! Lord, bow them and descend, And at thy presence
make these mountains flow, These mountains of cold ice in me! Thou art Refining fire; oh, then,
refine my heart, My foul, foul heart! Thou art immortal heat; Heat motion gives; then warm
it, till it beat; So beat for thee, till thou in mercy hear; So hear, that thou must open;
open to A sinful wretch, a wretch that caused thy woe; Thy woe, who caused his weal; so far
his weal That thou forgott'st thine own, for thou didst seal Mine with thy blood, thy blood
which makes thee mine, Mine ever, ever; and me ever thine.

PSALM CIV.

1  Up, O my soul, and bless the Lord! O God,
     My God, how great, how very great art thou!
   Honour and majesty have their abode
               With thee, and crown thy brow.

2  Thou cloth'st thyself with light as with a robe,
     And the high, glorious heavens thy mighty hand
   Doth spread like curtains round about this globe
               Of air, and sea, and land.

Tightly had he had been eaten whatever was become in

   And were so had he may have to forget aside that he was

   .
               

21 Thou send'st thy Spirit forth, and they revive,
     The frozen earth's dead face thou dost renew.
   Thus thou thy glory through the world dost drive,
               And to thy works art true.

22 Thine eyes behold the earth, and the whole stage
     Is moved and trembles, the hills melt and smoke
   With thy least touch; lightnings and winds that rage
               At thy rebuke are broke.

23 Therefore as long as thou wilt give me breath
     I will in songs to thy great name employ
   That gift of thine, and to my day of death
               Thou shalt be all my joy.

24 I'll spice my thoughts with thee, and from thy word
     Gather true comforts; but the wicked liver
   Shall be consumed. O my soul, bless thy Lord!
               Yea, bless thou him for ever!

THE TIMBER.

2  And still a new succession sings and flies;
     Fresh groves grow up, and their green branches shoot
   Towards the old and still-enduring skies,
     While the low violet thrives at their root.

3  But thou, beneath the sad and heavy line
     Of death, doth waste all senseless, cold, and dark;
   Where not so much as dreams of light may shine,
     Nor any thought of greenness, leaf, or bark.

4  And yet, as if some deep hate and dissent,
     Bred in thy growth betwixt high winds and thee,
   Were still alive, thou dost great storms resent,
     Before they come, and know'st how near they be.

5  Else all at rest thou liest, and the fierce breath
     Of tempests can no more disturb thy ease;
   But this thy strange resentment after death
     Means only those who broke in life thy peace.

6  So murdered man, when lovely life is done,
     And his blood freezed, keeps in the centre still
   Some secret sense, which makes the dead blood run
     At his approach that did the body kill.

7  And is there any murderer worse than sin?
     Or any storms more foul than a lewd life?
   Or what resentient can work more within
     Than true remorse, when with past sins at strife?

8  He that hath left life's vain joys and vain care,
     And truly hates to be detained on earth,
   Hath got an house where many mansions are,
     And keeps his soul unto eternal mirth.

9  But though thus dead unto the world, and ceased
     From sin, he walks a narrow, private way;
   Yet grief and old wounds make him sore displeased,
     And all his life a rainy, weeping day.

10 For though he should forsake the world, and live
     As mere a stranger as men long since dead;
   Yet joy itself will make a right soul grieve
     To think he should be so long vainly led.

11 But as shades set off light, so tears and grief,
     Though of themselves but a sad blubbered story,
   By showing the sin great, show the relief
     Far greater, and so speak my Saviour's glory.

12 If my way lies through deserts and wild woods,
     Where all the land with scorching heat is cursed;
   Better the pools should flow with rain and floods
     To fill my bottle, than I die with thirst.

13 Blest showers they are, and streams sent from above;
     Begetting virgins where they use to flow;
   The trees of life no other waters love,
     Than upper springs, and none else make them grow.

14 But these chaste fountains flow not till we die.
     Some drops may fall before; but a clear spring
     And ever running, till we leave to fling
   Dirt in her way, will keep above the sky.

'He that is dead is freed from sin.'--ROM. vi. 7.

THE JEWS.

1       When the fair year
      Of your Deliverer comes,
  And that long frost which now benumbs
  Your hearts shall thaw; when angels here
      Shall yet to man appear,
  And familiarly confer
  Beneath the oak and juniper;
        When the bright Dove,
  Which now these many, many springs
        Hath kept above,
        Shall with spread wings
  Descend, and living waters flow
  To make dry dust, and dead trees grow;

2       Oh, then, that I
  Might live, and see the olive bear
  Her proper branches! which now lie
        Scattered each where;
  And, without root and sap, decay;
  Cast by the husbandman away.
      And sure it is not far!
  For as your fast and foul decays,
  Forerunning the bright morning star,
  Did sadly note his healing rays
  Would shine elsewhere, since you were blind,
  And would be cross, when God was kind,--

3       So by all signs
  Our fulness too is now come in;
  And the same sun, which here declines
  And sets, will few hours hence begin
  To rise on you again, and look
  Towards old Mamre and Eshcol's brook.
        For surely he
  Who loved the world so as to give
  His only Son to make it free,
  Whose Spirit too doth mourn and grieve
  To see man lost, will for old love
  From your dark hearts this veil remove.

4 Faith sojourned first on earth in you,
    You were the dear and chosen stock:
  The arm of God, glorious and true,
    Was first revealed to be your rock.

5 You were the eldest child, and when
    Your stony hearts despised love,
  The youngest, even the Gentiles, then,
    Were cheered your jealousy to move.

6 Thus, righteous Father! dost thou deal
    With brutish men; thy gifts go round
  By turns, and timely, and so heal
    The lost son by the newly found.

PALM-SUNDAY.

1 Come, drop your branches, strew the way,
              Plants of the day!
  Whom sufferings make most green and gay.
  The King of grief, the Man of sorrow,
  Weeping still like the wet morrow,
  Your shades and freshness comes to borrow.

2 Put on, put on your best array;
  Let the joyed road make holyday,
  And flowers, that into fields do stray,
  Or secret groves, keep the highway.

3 Trees, flowers, and herbs; birds, beasts, and stones,
  That since man fell expect with groans
  To see the Lamb, come all at once,
  Lift up your heads and leave your moans;
              For here comes he
              Whose death will be
  Man's life, and your full liberty.

4 Hark! how the children shrill and high
              'Hosanna' cry;
  Their joys provoke the distant sky,
  Where thrones and seraphim reply;
  And their own angels shine and sing,
              In a bright ring:
              Such young, sweet mirth
              Makes heaven and earth
  Join in a joyful symphony.

5 The harmless, young, and happy ass,
  (Seen long before[1] this came to pass,)
  Is in these joys a high partaker,
  Ordained and made to bear his Maker.

6 Dear Feast of Palms, of flowers and dew!
    Whose fruitful dawn sheds hopes and lights;
  Thy bright solemnities did shew
    The third glad day through two sad nights.

7 I'll get me up before the sun,
    I'll cut me boughs off many a tree,
  And all alone full early run
    To gather flowers to welcome thee.

8 Then, like the palm, though wronged I'll bear,
    I will be still a child, still meek
  As the poor ass which the proud jeer,
    And only my dear Jesus seek.

9 If I lose all, and must endure
    The proverbed griefs of holy Job,
  I care not, so I may secure
    But one green branch and a white robe.

[1] Zechariah ix. 9.

PROVIDENCE.

1     Sacred and secret hand!
  By whose assisting, swift command
  The angel showed that holy well
    Which freed poor Hagar from her fears,
    And turned to smiles the begging tears
  Of young, distressed Ishmael.

2     How, in a mystic cloud,
  Which doth thy strange, sure mercies shroud,
  Dost thou convey man food and money,
    Unseen by him till they arrive
    Just at his mouth, that thankless hive,
  Which kills thy bees, and eats thy honey!

3     If I thy servant be,
  Whose service makes even captives free,
  A fish shall all my tribute pay,
    The swift-winged raven shall bring me meat,
    And I, like flowers, shall still go neat,
  As if I knew no month but May.

4     I will not fear what man
  With all his plots and power can.
  Bags that wax old may plundered be;
    But none can sequester or let
    A state that with the sun doth set,
  And comes next morning fresh as he.

5     Poor birds this doctrine sing,
  And herbs which on dry hills do spring,
  Or in the howling wilderness
    Do know thy dewy morning hours,
    And watch all night for mists or showers,
  Then drink and praise thy bounteousness.

6     May he for ever die
  Who trusts not thee, but wretchedly
  Hunts gold and wealth, and will not lend
    Thy service nor his soul one day!
    May his crown, like his hopes, be clay;
  And what he saves may his foes spend!

7     If all my portion here,
  The measure given by thee each year,
  Were by my causeless enemies
    Usurped; it never should me grieve,
    Who know how well thou canst relieve,
  Whose hands are open as thine eyes.

8     Great King of love and truth!
  Who wouldst not hate my froward youth,
  And wilt not leave me when grown old,
    Gladly will I, like Pontic sheep,
    Unto my wormwood diet keep,
  Since thou hast made thy arm my fold.

ST MARY MAGDALENE.

Dear, beauteous saint! more white than day, When in his naked, pure array; Fresher than morning-flowers,
which shew, As thou in tears dost, best in dew. How art thou changed, how lively, fair, Pleasing,
and innocent an air, Not tutored by thy glass, but free, Native, and pure, shines now in thee!
But since thy beauty doth still keep Bloomy and fresh, why dost thou weep? This dusky state
of sighs and tears Durst not look on those smiling years, When Magdal-castle was thy seat,
Where all was sumptuous, rare, and neat. Why lies this hair despised now Which once thy care
and art did show? Who then did dress the much-loved toy In spires, globes, angry curls and
coy, Which with skilled negligence seemed shed About thy curious, wild, young head? Why is
this rich, this pistic nard Spilt, and the box quite broke and marred? What pretty sullenness
did haste Thy easy hands to do this waste? Why art thou humbled thus, and low As earth thy
lovely head dost bow? Dear soul! thou knew'st flowers here on earth At their Lord's footstool
have their birth; Therefore thy withered self in haste Beneath his blest feet thou didst cast,
That at the root of this green tree Thy great decays restored might be. Thy curious vanities,
and rare Odorous ointments kept with care, And dearly bought, when thou didst see They could
not cure nor comfort thee; Like a wise, early penitent, Thou sadly didst to him present, Whose
interceding, meek, and calm Blood, is the world's all-healing balm. This, this divine restorative
Called forth thy tears, which ran in live And hasty drops, as if they had (Their Lord so near)
sense to be glad. Learn, ladies, here the faithful cure Makes beauty lasting, fresh, and pure;
Learn Mary's art of tears, and then Say you have got the day from men. Cheap, mighty art! her
art of love, Who loved much, and much more could move; Her art! whose memory must last Till
truth through all the world be passed; Till his abused, despised flame Return to heaven, from
whence it came, And send a fire down, that shall bring Destruction on his ruddy wing. Her art!
whose pensive, weeping eyes, Were once sin's loose and tempting spies; But now are fixed stars,
whose light Helps such dark stragglers to their sight.

Self-boasting Pharisee! how blind A judge wert thou, and how unkind! It was impossible that
thou, Who wert all false, shouldst true grief know. Is't just to judge her faithful tears By
that foul rheum thy false eye wears? 'This woman,' sayst thou, 'is a sinner!' And sat there
none such at thy dinner? Go, leper, go! wash till thy flesh Comes like a child's, spotless
and fresh; He is still leprous that still paints: Who saint themselves, they are no saints.

THE RAINBOW.

Still young and fine! but what is still in view We slight as old and soiled, though fresh and
new. When thou dost shine, darkness looks white and fair, Forms turn to music, clouds to smiles
and air: Rain gently spends his honey-drops, and pours Balm on the cleft earth, milk on grass
and flowers. Bright pledge of peace and sunshine! the sure tie Of thy Lord's hand, the object[1]
of his eye! When I behold thee, though my light be dim, Distant, and low, I can in thine see
him, Who looks upon thee from his glorious throne, And minds the covenant 'twixt all and one.
O foul, deceitful men! my God doth keep His promise still, but we break ours and sleep. After
the fall the first sin was in blood, And drunkenness quickly did succeed the flood; But since
Christ died, (as if we did devise To lose him too, as well as paradise,) These two grand sins
we join and act together, Though blood and drunkenness make but foul, foul weather. Water,
though both heaven's windows and the deep Full forty days o'er the drowned world did weep,
Could not reform us, and blood in despite, Yea, God's own blood, we tread upon and slight.
So those bad daughters, which God saved from fire, While Sodom yet did smoke, lay with their sire.

Then, peaceful, signal bow, but in a cloud Still lodged, where all thy unseen arrows shroud;
I will on thee as on a comet look, A comet, the sad world's ill-boding book; Thy light as luctual
and stained with woes I'll judge, where penal flames sit mixed and close. For though some think
thou shin'st but to restrain Bold storms, and simply dost attend on rain; Yet I know well,
and so our sins require, Thou dost but court cold rain, till rain turns fire.

[1] Genesis ix. 16.

THE SEED GROWING SECRETLY.

MARK IV. 26.

1  If this world's friends might see but once
     What some poor man may often feel,
   Glory and gold and crowns and thrones
     They would soon quit, and learn to kneel.

2  My dew, my dew! my early love,
     My soul's bright food, thy absence kills!
   Hover not long, eternal Dove!
     Life without thee is loose and spills.

3  Something I had, which long ago
     Did learn to suck and sip and taste;
   But now grown sickly, sad, and slow,
     Doth fret and wrangle, pine and waste.

4  Oh, spread thy sacred wings, and shake
     One living drop! one drop life keeps!
   If pious griefs heaven's joys awake,
     Oh, fill his bottle! thy child weeps!

5  Slowly and sadly doth he grow,
     And soon as left shrinks back to ill;
   Oh, feed that life, which makes him blow
     And spread and open to thy will!

6  For thy eternal, living wells
     None stained or withered shall come near:
   A fresh, immortal green there dwells,
     And spotless white is all the wear.

7  Dear, secret greenness! nursed below
     Tempests and winds and winter nights!
   Vex not that but One sees thee grow,
     That One made all these lesser lights.

8  If those bright joys he singly sheds
     On thee, were all met in one crown,
   Both sun and stars would hide their heads;
     And moons, though full, would get them down.

9  Let glory be their bait whose minds
     Are all too high for a low cell:
   Though hawks can prey through storms and winds,
     The poor bee in her hive must dwell.

10 Glory, the crowd's cheap tinsel, still
    To what most takes them is a drudge;
   And they too oft take good for ill,
    And thriving vice for virtue judge.

11 What needs a conscience calm and bright
     Within itself an outward test?
   Who breaks his glass to take more light,
     Makes way for storms into his rest.

12 Then bless thy secret growth, nor catch
     At noise, but thrive unseen and dumb;
   Keep clean, bear fruit, earn life, and watch,
     Till the white-winged reapers come!

CHILDHOOD.

I cannot reach it; and my striving eye
Dazzles at it, as at eternity.
    Were now that chronicle alive,
Those white designs which children drive,
And the thoughts of each harmless hour,
With their content too in my power,
Quickly would I make my path even,
And by mere playing go to heaven.

             Why should men love
A wolf more than a lamb or dove?
Or choose hell-fire and brimstone streams
Before bright stars and God's own beams?
Who kisseth thorns will hurt his face,
But flowers do both refresh and grace;
And sweetly living (fie on men!)
Are, when dead, medicinal then.
If seeing much should make staid eyes,
And long experience should make wise,
Since all that age doth teach is ill,
Why should I not love childhood still?
Why, if I see a rock or shelf,
Shall I from thence cast down myself,
Or by complying with the world,
From the same precipice be hurled?
Those observations are but foul,
Which make me wise to lose my soul.

And yet the practice worldlings call Business and weighty action all, Checking the poor child
for his play, But gravely cast themselves away.

Dear, harmless age! the short, swift span Where weeping virtue parts with man; Where love without
lust dwells, and bends What way we please without self-ends.

An age of mysteries! which he Must live twice that would God's face see; Which angels guard,
and with it play, Angels! which foul men drive away.

How do I study now, and scan Thee more than ere I studied man, And only see through a long
night Thy edges and thy bordering light! Oh for thy centre and mid-day! For sure that is the
narrow way!

ABEL'S BLOOD.

Sad, purple well! whose bubbling eye
Did first against a murderer cry;
Whose streams, still vocal, still complain
      Of bloody Cain;
And now at evening are as red
As in the morning when first shed.
      If single thou,
Though single voices are but low,
Couldst such a shrill and long cry rear
As speaks still in thy Maker's ear,
What thunders shall those men arraign
Who cannot count those they have slain,
Who bathe not in a shallow flood,
But in a deep, wide sea of blood--
A sea whose loud waves cannot sleep,
But deep still calleth upon deep;
Whose urgent sound, like unto that
Of many waters, beateth at
The everlasting doors above,
Where souls behind the altar move,
And with one strong, incessant cry
Inquire 'How long?' of the Most High?
              Almighty Judge!
At whose just laws no just men grudge;
Whose blessed, sweet commands do pour
Comforts and joys and hopes each hour
On those that keep them; oh, accept
Of his vowed heart, whom thou hast kept
From bloody men! and grant I may
That sworn memorial duly pay
To thy bright arm, which was my light
And leader through thick death and night!
              Aye may that flood,
That proudly spilt and despised blood,
Speechless and calm as infants sleep!
Or if it watch, forgive and weep
For those that spilt it! May no cries
From the low earth to high heaven rise,
But what, like his whose blood peace brings,
Shall, when they rise, speak better things
Than Abel's doth! May Abel be
Still single heard, while these agree
With his mild blood in voice and will,
Who prayed for those that did him kill!

RIGHTEOUSNESS.

1 Fair, solitary path! whose blessed shades
    The old, white prophets planted first and dressed;
  Leaving for us, whose goodness quickly fades,
    A shelter all the way, and bowers to rest;

2 Who is the man that walks in thee? who loves
    Heaven's secret solitude, those fair abodes,
  Where turtles build, and careless sparrows move,
    Without to-morrow's evils and future loads?

3 Who hath the upright heart, the single eye,
    The clean, pure hand, which never meddled pitch?
  Who sees invisibles, and doth comply
    With hidden treasures that make truly rich?

4        He that doth seek and love
             The things above,
   Whose spirit ever poor is, meek, and low;
         Who simple still and wise,
             Still homeward flies,
   Quick to advance, and to retreat most slow.

5       Whose acts, words, and pretence
             Have all one sense,
   One aim and end; who walks not by his sight;
        Whose eyes are both put out,
             And goes about
   Guided by faith, not by exterior light.

6       Who spills no blood, nor spreads
             Thorns in the beds
   Of the distressed, hasting their overthrow;
        Making the time they had
             Bitter and sad,
   Like chronic pains, which surely kill, though slow.

7  Who knows earth nothing hath
             Worth love or wrath,
   But in his Hope and Rock is ever glad.
        Who seeks and follows peace,
             When with the ease
   And health of conscience it is to be had.

8  Who bears his cross with joy,
             And doth employ
   His heart and tongue in prayers for his foes;
        Who lends not to be paid,
             And gives full aid
   Without that bribe which usurers impose.

9  Who never looks on man
             Fearful and wan,
   But firmly trusts in God; the great man's measure,
        Though high and haughty, must
             Be ta'en in dust;
   But the good man is God's peculiar treasure.

10 Who doth thus, and doth not
             These good deeds blot
   With bad, or with neglect; and heaps not wrath
        By secret filth, nor feeds
             Some snake, or weeds,
   Cheating himself--That man walks in this path.

JACOB'S PILLOW AND PILLAR.

I see the temple in thy pillar reared, And that dread glory which thy children feared, In mild,
clear visions, without a frown, Unto thy solitary self is shown. 'Tis number makes a schism:
throngs are rude, And God himself died by the multitude. This made him put on clouds, and fire,
and smoke; Hence he in thunder to thy offspring spoke. The small, still voice at some low cottage
knocks, But a strong wind must break thy lofty rocks.

The first true worship of the world's great King From private and selected hearts did spring;
But he most willing to save all mankind, Enlarged that light, and to the bad was kind. Hence
catholic or universal came A most fair notion, but a very name. For this rich pearl, like some
more common stone, When once made public, is esteemed by none. Man slights his Maker when familiar
grown, And sets up laws to pull his honour down. This God foresaw: and when slain by the crowd,
Under that stately and mysterious cloud Which his death scattered, he foretold the place And
form to serve him in should be true grace, And the meek heart; not in a mount, nor at Jerusalem,
with blood of beasts and fat. A heart is that dread place, that awful cell, That secret ark,
where the mild Dove doth dwell, When the proud waters rage: when heathens rule By God's permission,
and man turns a mule, This little Goshen, in the midst of night And Satan's seat, in all her
coasts hath light; Yea, Bethel shall have tithes, saith Israel's stone, And vows and visions,
though her foes cry, None. Thus is the solemn temple sunk again Into a pillar, and concealed
from men. And glory be to his eternal name, Who is contented that this holy flame Shall lodge
in such a narrow pit, till he With his strong arm turns our captivity!

But blessed Jacob, though thy sad distress Was just the same with ours, and nothing less; For
thou a brother, and bloodthirsty too,

Didst fly,[1] whose children wrought thy children's woe: Yet thou in all thy solitude and grief,
On stones didst sleep, and found'st but cold relief; Thou from the Day-star a long way didst
stand, And all that distance was law and command. But we a healing Sun, by day and night, Have
our sure guardian and our leading light. What thou didst hope for and believe we find And feel,
a Friend most ready, sure, and kind. Thy pillow was but type and shade at best, But we the
substance have, and on him rest.

[1] Obadiah 10; Amos i, 11.

THE FEAST.

1          Oh, come away,
           Make no delay,
   Come while my heart is clean and steady!
           While faith and grace
           Adorn the place,
   Making dust and ashes ready!

2          No bliss here lent
           Is permanent,
   Such triumphs poor flesh cannot merit;
           Short sips and sights
           Endear delights:
   Who seeks for more he would inherit.

3          Come then, true bread,
           Quickening the dead,
   Whose eater shall not, cannot die!
           Come, antedate
           On me that state,
   Which brings poor dust the victory.

4          Aye victory,
           Which from thine eye
   Breaks as the day doth from the east,
           When the spilt dew
           Like tears doth shew
   The sad world wept to be released.

5          Spring up, O wine,
           And springing shine
   With some glad message from his heart,
           Who did, when slain,
           These means ordain
   For me to have in him a part!

6          Such a sure part
           In his blest heart,
   The well where living waters spring,
           That, with it fed,
           Poor dust, though dead,
   Shall rise again, and live, and sing.

7          O drink and bread,
           Which strikes death dead,
   The food of man's immortal being!
           Under veils here
           Thou art my cheer,
   Present and sure without my seeing.

8          How dost thou fly
           And search and pry
   Through all my parts, and, like a quick
           And knowing lamp,
           Hunt out each damp,
   Whose shadow makes me sad or sick!

9          O what high joys!
           The turtle's voice
   And songs I hear! O quickening showers
           Of my Lord's blood,
           You make rocks bud,
   And crown dry hills with wells and flowers!

10         For this true ease,
           This healing peace,
   For this [brief] taste of living glory,
           My soul and all,
           Kneel down and fall,
   And sing his sad victorious story!

11         O thorny crown,
           More soft than down!
   O painful cross, my bed of rest!
           O spear, the key
           Opening the way!
   O thy worst state, my only best!

12         O all thy griefs
           Are my reliefs,
   As all my sins thy sorrows were!
           And what can I,
           To this reply?
   What, O God! but a silent tear?

13         Some toil and sow
           That wealth may flow,
   And dress this earth for next year's meat:
           But let me heed
           Why thou didst bleed,
   And what in the next world to eat.

'Blessed are they which are called unto the marriage supper of the Lamb.'--Rev. xix. 9.

THE WATERFALL.

With what deep murmurs, through time's silent stealth,
Does thy transparent, cool, and watery wealth
          Here flowing fall,
          And chide and call,
As if his liquid, loose retinue staid
Lingering, and were of this steep place afraid;
          The common pass,
          Where, clear as glass,
          All must descend,
          Not to an end,
But quickened by this deep and rocky grave,
Rise to a longer course more bright and brave.

  Dear stream! dear bank! where often I
  Have sat, and pleased my pensive eye;
  Why, since each drop of thy quick store
  Runs thither whence it flowed before,
  Should poor souls fear a shade or night,
  Who came (sure) from a sea of light?
  Or, since those drops are all sent back
  So sure to thee that none doth lack,
  Why should frail flesh doubt any more
  That what God takes he'll not restore?

  O useful element and clear!
  My sacred wash and cleanser here;
  My first consigner unto those
  Fountains of life, where the Lamb goes!
  What sublime truths and wholesome themes
  Lodge in thy mystical, deep streams!
  Such as dull man can never find,
  Unless that Spirit lead his mind,
  Which first upon thy face did move
  And hatched all with his quickening love.
  As this loud brook's incessant fall
  In streaming rings re-stagnates all,
  Which reach by course the bank, and then
  Are no more seen: just so pass men.
  O my invisible estate,
  My glorious liberty, still late!
  Thou art the channel my soul seeks,
  Not this with cataracts and creeks.

DR JOSEPH BEAUMONT.

This writer, though little known, appears to us to stand as high almost as any name in the
present volume, and we are proud to reprint here some considerable specimens of his magnificent
poetry.

Joseph Beaumont was sprung from a collateral branch of the ancient family of the Beaumonts,
that family from which sprung Sir John Beaumont, the author of 'Bosworth Field,' and Francis
Beaumont, the celebrated dramatist. He was born at Hadleigh, in Suffolk. Of his early life
nothing is known. He received his education at Cambridge, where, during the Civil War, he was
fellow and tutor of Peterhouse. Ejected by the Republicans from his offices, he retired to
Hadleigh, and spent his time in the com- position of his magnum opus, 'Psyche.' This poem appeared
in 1648; and in 1702, three years after the author's death, his son published a second edition,
with numerous corrections, and the addition of four cantos by the author. Beaumont also wrote
several minor pieces in English and Latin, a controversial tract in reply to Henry More's 'Mystery
of Godliness,' and several theological works which are still in MS., according to a provision
in his will to that effect. Peace and perpetuity to their slumbers!

After the Restoration, our author was not only reinstated in his former situations, but received
from his patron, Bishop Wren, several valuable pieces of preferment besides. Afterwards, he
exercised successively the offices of Master of Jesus and of Peterhouse, and was King's Professor
of Divinity from 1670 to 1699. In the latter year he died.

While praising the genius of Beaumont, we are far from commending his 'Psyche,' either as an
artistic whole, or as a readable book. It is, sooth to say, a dull allegory, in twenty-four
immense cantos, studded with the rarest beauties. It is considerably longer than the 'Faery
Queen,' nearly four times the length of the 'Paradise Lost,' and five or six times as long
as the 'Excursion.' To read it through now-a-days were to perform a purgatorial penance. But
the imagination and fancy are Spenserian, his colouring is often Titianesque in gorgeousness,
and his pictures of shadows, abstractions, and all fantastic forms, are so forcible as to seem
to start from the canvas. In painting the beautiful, his verse becomes careless and flowing
as a loosened zone; in painting the frightful and the infernal, his language, like his feeling,
seems to curdle and stiffen in horror, as where, speaking of Satan, he says--

    'His tawny teeth
  Were ragged grown, by endless gnashing at
  The dismal riddle of his living death.'

The 'Psyche' may be compared to a palace of Fairyland, where successive doors fly open to the
visitor--one revealing a banqueting-room filled with the materials of exuberant mirth; another,
an enchanted garden, with streams stealing from grottos, and nymphs gliding through groves;
a third conducting you to a dungeon full of dead men's bones and all uncleanness; a fourth,
to a pit which seems the mouth of hell, and whence cries of torture come up, shaking the smoke
that ascendeth up for ever and ever; and a fifth, to the open roof, over which the stars are
seen bending, and the far-off heavens are opening in glory; and of these doors there is no
end. We saw, when lately in Copenhagen, the famous tower of the Trinity Church, remarkable
for the grand view commanded from the summit, and for the broad spiral ascent winding within
it almost to the top, up which it is said Peter the Great, in 1716, used to drive himself and
his Empress in a coach-and-four. It was curious to feel ourselves ascending on a path nearly
level, and without the slightest perspiration or fatigue; and here, we thought, is the desiderated
'royal road' to difficulties fairly found. Large poems should be constructed on the same principle;
their quiet, broad interest should beguile their readers alike to their length and their loftiness.
It is exactly the reverse with 'Psyche.' But if any reader is wearied of some of the extracts
we have given, such as his verses on 'Eve,' on 'Paradise,' on 'End,' on 'The Death of his Wife,'
and on 'Imperial Rome,' we shall be very much disposed to question his capacity for appreciating
true poetry.

HELL.

1 Hell's court is built deep in a gloomy vale,
  High walled with strong damnation, moated round
  With flaming brimstone: full against the hall
  Roars a burnt bridge of brass: the yards abound
    With all envenomed herbs and trees, more rank
    And fruitless than on Asphaltite's bank.

2 The gate, where Fire and Smoke the porters be,
  Stands always ope with gaping greedy jaws.
  Hither flocked all the states of misery;
  As younger snakes, when their old serpent draws
    Them by a summoning hiss, haste down her throat
    Of patent poison their awed selves to shoot.

But there was the Caesar did not think him met

Incredibly, encyclical, that, for casualty to barratry,

 8 The mariner will trust no winds, although
   Upon his sails they blow fair flattery;
   No tides which, with all fawning smoothness, flow
   Can charm his fears into security;
     He credits none but thee, who art his bay,
     To which, through calms and storms, he hunts his way.

 9 And so have I, cheered up with hopes at last
   To double thee, endured a tedious sea;
   Through public foaming tempests have I passed;
   Through flattering calms of private suavity;
     Through interrupting company's thick press;
     And through the lake of mine own laziness:

10 Through many sirens' charms, which me invited
   To dance to ease's tunes, the tunes in fashion;
   Through many cross, misgiving thoughts, which frighted
   My jealous pen; and through the conjuration
     Of ignorant and envious censures, which
     Implacably against all poems itch:

11 But chiefly those which venture in a way
   That yet no Muse's feet have chose to trace;
   Which trust that Psyche and her Jesus may
   Adorn a verse with as becoming grace
     As Venus and her son; that truth may be
     A nobler theme than lies and vanity.

12 Which broach no Aganippe's streams, but those
   Where virgin souls without a blush may bathe;
   Which dare the boisterous multitude oppose
   With gentle numbers; which despise the wrath
     Of galled sin; which think not fit to trace
     Or Greek or Roman song with slavish pace.

13 And seeing now I am in ken of thee,
   The harbour which inflamed my desire,
   And with this steady patience ballas'd[1] me
   In my uneven road; I am on fire,
     Till into thy embrace myself I throw,
     And on the shore hang up my finished vow.

[1] 'Ballas'd:' ballasted.

MISCELLANEOUS PIECES.

FROM ROBERT HEATH.

WHAT IS LOVE?

1 Tis a child of fancy's getting,
    Brought up between hope and fear,
  Fed with smiles, grown by uniting
    Strong, and so kept by desire:
  'Tis a perpetual vestal fire
            Never dying,
  Whose smoke like incense doth aspire,
            Upwards flying.

2 It is a soft magnetic stone,
    Attracting hearts by sympathy,
  Binding up close two souls in one,
    Both discoursing secretly:
 'Tis the true Gordian knot, that ties
            Yet ne'er unbinds,
  Fixing thus two lovers' eyes,
            As well as minds.

3 Tis the spheres' heavenly harmony,
    Where two skilful hands do strike;
  And every sound expressively
    Marries sweetly with the like:
  'Tis the world's everlasting chain
            That all things tied,
   And bid them, like the fixed wain,
            Unmoved to bide.

PROTEST OF LOVE.

When I thee all o'er do view I all o'er must love thee too. By that smooth forehead, where's
expressed The candour of thy peaceful breast, By those fair twin-like stars that shine, And
by those apples of thine eyne: By the lambkins and the kids Playing 'bout thy fair eyelids:
By each peachy-blossomed cheek, And thy satin skin, more sleek And white than Flora's whitest
lilies, Or the maiden daffodillies: By that ivory porch, thy nose: By those double-blanched
rows Of teeth, as in pure coral set: By each azure rivulet, Running in thy temples, and Those
flowery meadows 'twixt them stand: By each pearl-tipt ear by nature, as On each a jewel pendent
was: By those lips all dewed with bliss, Made happy in each other's kiss.

MY MIND TO ME A KINGDOM IS.

2 No princely port, nor wealthy store,
    Nor force to win a victory;
  No wily wit to salve a sore,
    No shape to win a loving eye;
  To none of these I yield as thrall,
  For why, my mind despise them all.

4 I press to bear no haughty sway;
    I wish no more than may suffice;
  I do no more than well I may.
    Look what I want, my mind supplies;
  Lo, thus I triumph like a king,

3           Fain would I know the reason
              Why the little ant,
            All the summer season,
            Layeth up provision
              On condition
            To know no winter's want;
  And how housewives, that are so good and painful,
  Do unto their husbands prove so good and gainful;
  And why the lazy drones to them do prove disdainful.
  Hallo, my fancy, whither wilt thou go?

5           When I look before me,
              There I do behold
            There's none that sees or knows me;
            All the world's a-gadding,
              Running madding;
            None doth his station hold.
  He that is below envieth him that riseth,
  And he that is above, him that's below despiseth,
  So every man his plot and counter-plot deviseth.
  Hallo, my fancy, whither wilt thou go?

6           Look, look, what bustling
              Here I do espy;
            Each another jostling,
            Every one turmoiling,
              The other spoiling,
            As I did pass them by.
  One sitteth musing in a dumpish passion,
  Another hangs his head, because he's out of fashion,
  A third is fully bent on sport and recreation.
  Hallo, my fancy, whither wilt thou go?

7           Amidst the foamy ocean,
              Fain would I know
            What doth cause the motion,
              And returning
              In its journeying,
            And doth so seldom swerve!
  And how these little fishes that swim beneath salt water,
  Do never blind their eye; methinks it is a matter
  An inch above the reach of old Erra Pater!
  Hallo, my fancy, whither wilt thou go?

8           Fain would I be resolved
              How things are done;
            And where the bull was calved
              Of bloody Phalaris,
              And where the tailor is
            That works to the man i' the moon!
  Fain would I know how Cupid aims so rightly;
  And how these little fairies do dance and leap so lightly;
  And where fair Cynthia makes her ambles nightly.
  Hallo, my fancy, whither wilt thou go!

9           In conceit like Phaeton,
              I'll mount Phoebus' chair;

              In my journeying,
            Hurrying through the air.
  Fain would I hear his fiery horses neighing,
  And see how they on foamy bits are playing;
  All the stars and planets I will be surveying!
  Hallo, my fancy, whither wilt thou go?

10          Oh, from what ground of nature
              Doth the pelican,
            That self-devouring creature,
              Prove so froward
              And untoward,
            Her vitals for to strain?
  And why the subtle fox, while in death's wounds is lying,
  Doth not lament his pangs by howling and by crying;
  And why the milk-white swan doth sing when she's a-dying.
  Hallo, my fancy, whither wilt thou got

11          Fain would I conclude this,
              At least make essay,
            What similitude is;
              Why fowls of a feather
              Flock and fly together,
            And lambs know beasts of prey:
  How Nature's alchemists, these small laborious creatures,
  Acknowledge still a prince in ordering their matters,
  And suffer none to live, who slothing lose their features.
  Hallo, my fancy, whither wilt thou go?

12          I'm rapt with admiration,
              When I do ruminate,
            Men of an occupation,
            How each one calls him brother,
            Yet each envieth other,
              And yet still intimate!
  Yea, I admire to see some natures further sundered,
  Than antipodes to us. Is it not to be wondered,
  In myriads ye'll find, of one mind scarce a hundred!
  Hallo, my fancy, whither wilt thou go? 

Had laud bishop was certain Puritans. A
              Hall was high. A one
            might justly alter he might.

14          Fain also would I prove this,
              By considering
            What that which you call love is:
            Whether it be a folly
              Or a melancholy,
            Or some heroic thing!
  Fain I'd have it proved, by one whom love hath wounded,
  And fully upon one his desire hath founded,
  Whom nothing else could please though the world were rounded.

To Clausius also was important an electric retreat
              of the explanation in electrolysis,
            and he put continually
            the inspiration that molecules
              in electrolytes are frontward
            due substance, the interchanging force not do, but merely directing,
the reciprocation.
  Fain would I know, if in some lofty mountain,
  Where the moon sojourns, if there be trees or fountain;
  If there be beasts of prey, or yet be fields to hunt in.
  Hallo, my fancy, whither wilt thou go?

16          Fain would I have it tried
              By experiment,
            By none can be denied;
            If in this bulk of nature,
            There be voids less or greater,
              Or all remains complete?
  Fain would I know if beasts have any reason;
  If falcons killing eagles do commit a treason;
  If fear of winter's want makes swallows fly the season.
  Hallo, my fancy, whither wilt thou go;

17          Hallo, my fancy, hallo,
              Stay, stay at home with me,
            I can thee no longer follow,
            For thou hast betrayed me,
              And bewrayed me;
            It is too much for thee.
  Stay, stay at home with me; leave off thy lofty soaring;
  Stay thou at home with me, and on thy books be poring;
  For he that goes abroad, lays little up in storing:
  Thou'rt welcome home, my fancy, welcome home to me.

4  But if the house be swept,
   And from uncleanness kept,
   We praise the household maid,
   And duly she is paid;
 For we use, before we go,
 To drop a tester in her shoe.

5  Upon a mushroom's head
   Our tablecloth we spread;
   A grain of rye or wheat
   Is manchet which we eat;
 Pearly drops of dew we drink,
 In acorn cups filled to the brink.

6  The brains of nightingales,
   With unctuous fat of snails,
   Between two cockles stewed,
   Is meat that's easily chewed;
 Tails of worms, and marrow of mice,
 Do make a dish that's wondrous nice.

7  The grasshopper, gnat, and fly,
   Serve us for our minstrelsy;
   Grace said, we dance a while,
   And so the time beguile;
 And if the moon doth hide her head,
 The glow-worm lights us home to bed.
