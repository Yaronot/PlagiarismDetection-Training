In 1898 a reprint of the first edition was given to the public, prefaced by a brief eulogium
of the book and a slight notice of the author.  It brought to the writer of the "Introduction"
not only kind and indulgent criticism, but valuable corrections, fresh facts, clues to further
knowledge.  These last have been carefully followed out.  The unwary statement that Kinglake
never spoke after his first failure in the House has been atoned by a careful study of all
his speeches in and out of Parliament.  His reviews in the "Quarterly" and elsewhere have been
noted; impressions of his manner and appearance at different periods of his life have been
recovered from coaeval acquaintances; his friend Hayward's Letters, the numerous allusions
in Lord Houghton's Life, Mrs. Crosse's lively chapters in "Red Letter Days of my Life," Lady
Gregory's interesting recollections of the Athenaeum Club in Blackwood of December, 1895, the
somewhat slender notice in the "Dictionary of National Biography," have all been carefully

  Here during the thirties Sydney Smith
was a frequent and a welcome visitor; it was in answer to old Mrs. Kinglake that he uttered
his audacious mot on being asked if he would object, as a neighbouring clergyman had done,
to bury a Dissenter:  "Not bury Dissenters?  I should like to be burying them all day!"

its manufactures had died out, its society become Philistine and bourgeois--"little men who
walk in narrow ways"-- while from pre-eminence in electoral venality among English boroughs
it was saved only by the near proximity of Bridgewater. "an'if i occupy an'died away acrost my
