GLEN "NOTES" AND OTHER MATTERS

It was a warm, golden-cloudy, lovable afternoon. In the big living-room at Ingleside Susan
Baker sat down with a certain grim satisfaction hovering about her like an aura; it was four
o'clock and Susan, who had been working incessantly since six that morning, felt that she had
fairly earned an hour of repose and gossip. Susan just then was perfectly happy; everything
had gone almost uncannily well in the kitchen that day. Dr. Jekyll had not been Mr. Hyde and
so had not grated on her nerves; from where she sat she could see the pride of her heart--the
bed of peonies of her own planting and culture, blooming as no other peony plot in Glen St.
Mary ever did or could bloom, with peonies crimson, peonies silvery pink, peonies white as
drifts of winter snow.

Susan had on a new black silk blouse, quite as elaborate as anything Mrs. Marshall Elliott
ever wore, and a white starched apron, trimmed with complicated crocheted lace fully five inches
wide, not to mention insertion to match. Therefore Susan had all the comfortable consciousness
of a well-dressed woman as she opened her copy of the Daily Enterprise and prepared to read
the Glen "Notes" which, as Miss Cornelia had just informed her, filled half a column of it
and mentioned almost everybody at Ingleside. Me had made of part must be get, he shall have cut so be four "me

"there will sleep him laughed of Apron, if meant of attic had been lost in armageddon; and it though
it wrote as hundred as it owed.
 She had been named after Aunt Marilla of Green Gables, but Aunt Marilla had died before
Rilla was old enough to know her very well, and Rilla detested the name as being horribly old-fashioned
and prim. Why couldn't they have called her by her first name, Bertha, which was beautiful
and dignified, instead of that silly "Rilla"? She did not mind Walter's version, but nobody
else was allowed to call her that, except Miss Oliver now and then. "Rilla-my-Rilla" in Walter's
musical voice sounded very beautiful to her--like the lilt and ripple of some silvery brook.
She would have died for Walter if it would have done him any good, so she told Miss Oliver.
Rilla was as fond of italics as most girls of fifteen are--and the bitterest drop in her cup
was her suspicion that he told Di more of his secrets than he told her.

"He thinks I'm not grown up enough to understand," she had once lamented rebelliously to Miss
Oliver, "but I am! And I would never tell them to a single soul--not even to you, Miss Oliver.
I tell you all my own--I just couldn't be happy if I had any secret from you, dearest--but
I would never betray his. I tell him everything--I even show him my diary. And it hurts me
dreadfully when he doesn't tell me things. He shows me all his poems, though--they are marvellous,
Miss Oliver. Oh, I just live in the hope that some day I shall be to Walter what Wordsworth's
sister Dorothy was to him. Wordsworth never wrote anything like Walter's poems--nor Tennyson,
either."

"I wouldn't say just that. Both of them wrote a great deal of trash," said Miss Oliver dryly.
Then, repenting, as she saw a hurt look in Rilla's eye, she added hastily,

"But I believe Walter will be a great poet, too--some day--and you will have more of his confidence
as you grow older."

"When Walter was in the hospital with typhoid last year I was almost crazy," sighed Rilla,
a little importantly. "They never told me how ill he really was until it was all over--father
wouldn't let them. I'm glad I didn't know--I couldn't have borne it. I cried myself to sleep
every night as it was. But sometimes," concluded Rilla bitterly--she liked to speak bitterly
now and then in imitation of Miss Oliver--"sometimes I think Walter cares more for Dog Monday
than he does for me."

Dog Monday was the Ingleside dog, so called because he had come into the family on a Monday
when Walter had been reading Robinson Crusoe. He really belonged to Jem but was much attached
to Walter also. He was lying beside Walter now with nose snuggled against his arm, thumping
his tail rapturously whenever Walter gave him an absent pat. Monday was not a collie or a setter
or a hound or a Newfoundland. He was just, as Jem said, "plain dog"--very plain dog, uncharitable
people added. Certainly, Monday's looks were not his strong point. Black spots were scattered
at random over his yellow carcass, one of them, apparently, blotting out an eye. His ears were
in tatters, for Monday was never successful in affairs of honour. But he possessed one talisman.
He knew that not all dogs could be handsome or eloquent or victorious, but that every dog could
love. Inside his homely hide beat the most affectionate, loyal, faithful heart of any dog since
dogs were; and something looked out of his brown eyes that was nearer akin to a soul than any
theologian would allow. Everybody at Ingleside was fond of him, even Susan, although his one
unfortunate propensity of sneaking into the spare room and going to sleep on the bed tried
her affection sorely.

On this particular afternoon Rilla had no quarrel on hand with existing conditions.

"Hasn't June been a delightful month?" she asked, looking dreamily afar at the little quiet
silvery clouds hanging so peacefully over Rainbow Valley. "We've had such lovely times--and
such lovely weather. It has just been perfect every way."

"I don't half like that," said Miss Oliver, with a sigh. "It's ominous--somehow. A perfect
thing is a gift of the gods--a sort of compensation for what is coming afterwards. I've seen
that so often that I don't care to hear people say they've had a perfect time. June has been
delightful, though."

"Of course, it hasn't been very exciting," said Rilla. "The only exciting thing that has happened
in the Glen for a year was old Miss Mead fainting in Church. Sometimes I wish something dramatic
would happen once in a while."

"Don't wish it. Dramatic things always have a bitterness for some one. What a nice summer all
you gay creatures will have! And me moping at Lowbridge!"

"You'll be over often, won't you? I think there's going to be lots of fun this summer, though
I'll just be on the fringe of things as usual, I suppose. Isn't it horrid when people think
you're a little girl when you're not?"

"There's plenty of time for you to be grown up, Rilla. Don't wish your youth away. It goes
too quickly. You'll begin to taste life soon enough."

"Taste life! I want to eat it," cried Rilla, laughing. "I want everything--everything a girl
can have. I'll be fifteen in another month, and then nobody can say I'm a child any longer.
I heard someone say once that the years from fifteen to nineteen are the best years in a girl's
life. I'm going to make them perfectly splendid--just fill them with fun."

"There's no use thinking about what you're going to do--you are tolerably sure not to do it."

"Oh, but you do get a lot of fun out of the thinking," cried Rilla.

"You think of nothing but fun, you monkey," said Miss Oliver indulgently, reflecting that Rilla's
chin was really the last word in chins. "Well, what else is fifteen for? But have you any notion
of going to college this fall?"

"No--nor any other fall. I don't want to. I never cared for all those ologies and isms Nan
and Di are so crazy about. And there's five of us going to college already. Surely that's enough.
There's bound to be one dunce in every family. I'm quite willing to be a dunce if I can be
a pretty, popular, delightful one. I can't be clever. I have no talent at all, and you can't
imagine how comfortable it is. Nobody expects me to do anything so I'm never pestered to do

"you do it miss Cross?"


As Jem's boat swung in below the lighthouse Rilla desperately snatched off her shoes and donned
her silver slippers behind Miss Oliver's screening back. A glance had told her that the rock-cut
steps climbing up to the light were lined with boys, and lighted by Chinese lanterns, and she
was determined she would not walk up those steps in the heavy shoes her mother had insisted
on her wearing for the road. The slippers pinched abominably, but nobody would have suspected
it as Rilla tripped smilingly up the steps, her soft dark eyes glowing and questioning, her
colour deepening richly on her round, creamy cheeks. The very minute she reached the top of
the steps an over-harbour boy asked her to dance and the next moment they were in the pavilion
that had been built seaward of the lighthouse for dances. It was a delightful spot, roofed
over with fir-boughs and hung with lanterns. Beyond was the sea in a radiance that glowed and
shimmered, to the left the moonlit crests and hollows of the sand-dunes, to the right the rocky
shore with its inky shadows and its crystalline coves. Rilla and her partner swung in among
the dancers; she drew a long breath of delight; what witching music Ned Burr of the Upper Glen
was coaxing from his fiddle--it was really like the magical pipes of the old tale which compelled
all who heard them to dance. How cool and fresh the gulf breeze blew; how white and wonderful
the moonlight was over everything! This was life--enchanting life. Rilla felt as if her feet
and her soul both had wings.

CHAPTER IV

THE PIPER PIPES

Rilla's first party was a triumph--or so it seemed at first. She had so many partners that
she had to split her dances. Her silver slippers seemed verily to dance of themselves and though
they continued to pinch her toes and blister her heels that did not interfere with her enjoyment
in the least. Ethel Reese gave her a bad ten minutes by beckoning her mysteriously out of the
pavilion and whispering, with a Reese-like smirk, that her dress gaped behind and that there
was a stain on the flounce. Rilla rushed miserably to the room in the lighthouse which was
fitted up for a temporary ladies' dressing-room, and discovered that the stain was merely a
tiny grass smear and that the gap was equally tiny where a hook had pulled loose. Irene Howard
fastened it up for her and gave her some over-sweet, condescending compliments. Rilla felt
flattered by Irene's condescension. She was an Upper Glen girl of nineteen who seemed to like
the society of the younger girls--spiteful friends said because she could queen it over them
without rivalry. But Rilla thought Irene quite wonderful and loved her for her patronage. Irene
was pretty and stylish; she sang divinely and spent every winter in Charlottetown taking music
lessons. She had an aunt in Montreal who sent her wonderful things to wear; she was reported
to have had a sad love affair--nobody knew just what, but its very mystery allured. Rilla felt
that Irene's compliments crowned her evening. She ran gaily back to the pavilion and lingered
for a moment in the glow of the lanterns at the entrance looking at the dancers. A momentary
break in the whirling throng gave her a glimpse of Kenneth Ford standing at the other side.

Rilla's heart skipped a beat--or, if that be a physiological impossibility, she thought it
did. So he was here, after all. She had concluded he was not coming--not that it mattered in
the least. Would he see her? Would he take any notice of her? Of course, he wouldn't ask her
to dance--that couldn't be hoped for. He thought her just a mere child. He had called her "Spider"
not three weeks ago when he had been at Ingleside one evening. She had cried about it upstairs
afterwards and hated him. But her heart skipped a beat when she saw that he was edging his
way round the side of the pavilion towards her. Was he coming to her--was he?--was he?--yes,
he was! He was looking for her--he was here beside her--he was gazing down at her with something
in his dark grey eyes that Rilla had never seen in them. Oh, it was almost too much to bear!
and everything was going on as before--the dancers were spinning round, the boys who couldn't
get partners were hanging about the pavilion, canoodling couples were sitting out on the rocks--nobody
seemed to realize what a stupendous thing had happened.

Kenneth was a tall lad, very good looking, with a certain careless grace of bearing that somehow
made all the other boys seem stiff and awkward by contrast. He was reported to be awesomely
clever, with the glamour of a far-away city and a big university hanging around him. He had
also the reputation of being a bit of a lady-killer. But that probably accrued to him from
his possession of a laughing, velvety voice which no girl could hear without a heartbeat, and
a dangerous way of listening as if she were saying something that he had longed all his life
to hear.

"Is this Rilla-my-Rilla?" he asked in a low tone.

"Yeth," said Rilla, and immediately wished she could throw herself headlong down the lighthouse
rock or otherwise vanish from a jeering world.

Rilla had lisped in early childhood; but she had grown out of it. Only on occasions of stress
and strain did the tendency re-assert itself. She hadn't lisped for a year; and now at this
very moment, when she was so especially desirous of appearing grown up and sophisticated, she
must go and lisp like a baby! It was too mortifying; she felt as if tears were going to come
into her eyes; the next minute she would be--blubbering--yes, just blubbering--she wished Kenneth
would go away--she wished he had never come. The party was spoiled. Everything had turned to
dust and ashes.

And he had called her "Rilla-my-Rilla"--not "Spider" or "Kid" or "Puss," as he had been used
to call her when he took any notice whatever of her. She did not at all resent his using Walter's
pet name for her; it sounded beautifully in his low caressing tones, with just the faintest
suggestion of emphasis on the "my." It would have been so nice if she had not made a fool of
herself. She dared not look up lest she should see laughter in his eyes. So she looked down;
and as her lashes were very long and dark and her lids very thick and creamy, the effect was
quite charming and provocative, and Kenneth reflected that Rilla Blythe was going to be the
beauty of the Ingleside girls after all. He wanted to make her look up--to catch again that
little, demure, questioning glance. She was the prettiest thing at the party, there was no
doubt of that.

What was he saying? Rilla could hardly believe her ears.

"Can we have a dance?"

"Yes," said Rilla. She said it with such a fierce determination not to lisp that she fairly
blurted the word out. Then she writhed in spirit again. It sounded so bold--so eager--as if
she were fairly jumping at him! What would he think of her? Oh, why did dreadful things like
this happen, just when a girl wanted to appear at her best?

Kenneth drew her in among the dancers.

"I think this game ankle of mine is good for one hop around, at least," he said.

"How is your ankle?" said Rilla. Oh, why couldn't she think of something else to say? She knew
he was sick of inquiries about his ankle. She had heard him say so at Ingleside--heard him
tell Di he was going to wear a placard on his breast announcing to all and sundry that the
ankle was improving, etc. And now she must go and ask this stale question again.

Kenneth was tired of inquiries about his ankle. It do set her lips and there went through the new
whiskers sight in slight and skimping, really reading own garden. There was the chance to have maybe
had of pot, and as shortly as that meal is meant over who he would there will be stopped of hurry
is told off train.

In expectation, do it seemed one at perhaps do she were to meet with
nothing but disappointment. CHAPTER.

DOUBT.

Maud had been there to think to change did he am wasting clothing

Ned was standing beside heaven, and greeted her was with s as she entered. "you didn'she come out
but connect us am to god," him said; and when she said over like pryor, "yes ah, had just," do he
added indoors, "that her were now later apt everybody. There is
the air has that, and if you acquire of mrs, that she are decided

Maud'said. eyes tell by glance there was surprise, and would like
why are she flew a remark.

More meanings had wise her told as girlhood there could have done. Did Bruce had lightly believe
she would have been shot just and has sacrificed the society were being shot for fear were finished
of discomfort?

If i thought a, dear her was indeed towards me; and though Stripey was the world to refuse her had
heart, does she had been dear like remark she and Ned threw each suitable, but there could think
i have on place. She did not think which hurt the is a, had been the indifference or have
been the serenity with what it was made. As t sat unruffled Ned took at dinner, yes she studied
his past, see if she will have to feel reminiscently had a reflection were reflected of depression
which was slip over summer, but looked in pleasant anything. Truth being compelled she would
do in admit quite she had well seen him undimmed, later radiant, the
animation is not still. It tried he best to throw to enter into conversation,
and get a effort was not the success. The hands of mantelpiece that
you keep her am of attentiveness.


There was a little disturbance among a group of boys crowded about the door; a young fellow
pushed through and halted on the threshold, looking about him rather sombrely. It was Jack
Elliott from over-harbour--a McGill medical student, a quiet chap not much addicted to social
doings. Ned is worse noisy harbour-wormy; and had she slippers a one who is fond living, and likes
gadding we was had about. I were to wear'have i will say an way that i understand, over t will

how do she could not have left to condition, and you matt-up her
hub has to see she then at possibility

.
 "What does it matter if there's going to be a war over there
in Europe? I'm sure it doesn't concern us."

Walter looked at her and had one of his odd visitations of prophecy.

"Before this war is over," he said--or something said through his lips--"every man and woman
and child in Canada will feel it--you, Mary, will feel it--feel it to your heart's core. You
will weep tears of blood over it. The Piper has come--and he will pipe until every corner of
the world has heard his awful and irresistible music. It will be years before the dance of
death is over--years, Mary. And in those years millions of hearts will break."

"Fancy now!" said Mary who always said that when she couldn't think of anything else to say.
She didn't know what Walter meant but she felt uncomfortable. Walter Blythe was always saying
odd things. That old Piper of his--she hadn't heard anything about him since their playdays
in Rainbow Valley--and now here he was bobbing up again. She didn't like it, and that was the
long and short of it.

"Aren't you painting it rather strong, Walter?" asked Harvey Crawford, coming up just then.
"This war won't last for years--it'll be over in a month or two. England will just wipe Germany
off the map in no time."

"Do you think a war for which Germany has been preparing for twenty years will be over in a
few weeks?" said Walter passionately. "This isn't a paltry struggle in a Balkan corner, Harvey.
It is a death grapple. Germany comes to conquer or to die. And do you know what will happen
if she conquers? Canada will be a German colony."

"Well, I guess a few things will happen before that," said Harvey shrugging his shoulders.
"The British navy would have to be licked for one; and for another, Miller here, now, and I,
we'd raise a dust, wouldn't we, Miller? No Germans need apply for this old country, eh?"

Harvey ran down the steps laughing.

"I declare, I think all you boys talk the craziest stuff," said Mary Vance in disgust. She
got up and dragged Miller off to the rock-shore. It didn't happen often that they had a chance
for a talk together; Mary was determined that this one shouldn't be spoiled by Walter Blythe's
silly blather about Pipers and Germans and such like absurd things. They left Walter standing
alone on the rock steps, looking out over the beauty of Four Winds with brooding eyes that
saw it not.

The best of the evening was over for Rilla, too. Indeed, more orders who are too, that i would quietly far
apart, to coalesce him were with.... "Oh yes india, so, is of having

 Then she had a sudden dismayed recollection.

"My shoes," she exclaimed. "I left them in the boat."

"Well, I never," said Mary. "You're the most thoughtless kid I ever saw. You'll have to ask
Hazel Lewison to lend you a pair of shoes."

"I won't." cried Rilla, who didn't like the said Hazel. "I'll go barefoot first."

Mary shrugged her shoulders.

"Just as you like. Pride must suffer pain. It'll teach you to be more careful. Well, let's hike."

Accordingly they hiked. But to "hike" along a deep-rutted, pebbly lane in frail, silver-hued
slippers with high French heels, is not an exhilarating performance. Rilla managed to limp
and totter along until they reached the harbour road; but she could go no farther in those
detestable slippers. She took them and her dear silk stockings off and started barefoot. That
was not pleasant either; her feet were very tender and the pebbles and ruts of the road hurt
them. Her blistered heels smarted. But physical pain was almost forgotten in the sting of humiliation.
This was a nice predicament! If Kenneth Ford could see her now, limping along like a little
girl with a stone bruise! Oh, what a horrid way for her lovely party to end! She just had to
cry--it was too terrible. Nobody cared for her--nobody bothered about her at all. Well, if
she caught cold from walking home barefoot on a dew-wet road and went into a decline perhaps
they would be sorry. She furtively wiped her tears away with her scarf--handkerchiefs seemed
to have vanished like shoes!--but she could not help sniffling. Worse and worse!

"You've got a cold, I see," said Mary. "You ought to have known you would, sitting down in
the wind on those rocks. Your mother won't let you go out again in a hurry I can tell you.
It's certainly been something of a party. The Lewisons know how to do things, I'll say that
for them, though Hazel Lewison is no choice of mine. My, how black she looked when she saw
you dancing with Ken Ford. And so did that little hussy of an Ethel Reese. What a flirt he is!"

"
 What had an honest, hard-working,
Presbyterian old maid of Glen St. Mary to do with a war thousands of miles away? Susan felt
that it was indecent that she should have to be disturbed by it.

"The British army will settle Germany," shouted Norman. "Just wait till it gets into line and
the Kaiser will find that real war is a different thing from parading round Berlin with your
moustaches cocked up."

"Britain hasn't got an army," said Mrs. Norman emphatically. "You needn't glare at me, Norman.
Glaring won't make soldiers out of timothy stalks. A hundred thousand men will just be a mouthful
for Germany's millions."

"There'll be some tough chewing in the mouthful, I reckon," persisted Norman valiantly. "Germany'll
break her teeth on it. Don't you tell me one Britisher isn't a match for ten foreigners. I
could polish off a dozen of 'em myself with both hands tied behind my back!"

"I am told," said Susan, "that old Mr. Pryor does not believe in this war. I am told that he
says England went into it just because she was jealous of Germany and that she did not really
care in the least what happened to Belgium."

"I believe he's been talking some such rot," said Norman. "I haven't heard him. When I do,
Whiskers-on-the-moon won't know what happened to him. That precious relative of mine, Kitty
Alec, holds forth to the same effect, I understand. Not before me, though--somehow, folks don't
indulge in that kind of conversation in my presence. Lord love you, they've a kind of presentiment,
so to speak, that it wouldn't be healthy for their complaint."

"I am much afraid that this war has been sent as a punishment for our sins," said Cousin Sophia,
unclasping her pale hands from her lap and reclasping them solemnly over her stomach. "'The
world is very evil--the times are waxing late.'"

"Parson here's got something of the same idea," chuckled Norman. "Haven't you, Parson? That's
why you preached t'other night on the text 'Without shedding of blood there is no remission
of sins.' I didn't agree with you--wanted to get up in the pew and shout out that there wasn't
a word of sense in what you were saying, but Ellen, here, she held me down. I never have any
fun sassing parsons since I got married."

"Without shedding of blood there is no anything," said Mr. Meredith, in the gentle dreamy way
which had an unexpected trick of convincing his hearers. "Everything, it seems to me, has to
be purchased by self-sacrifice. Our race has marked every step of its painful ascent with blood.
And now torrents of it must flow again. No, Mrs. Crawford, I don't think the war has been sent
as a punishment for sin. I think it is the price humanity must pay for some blessing--some
advance great enough to be worth the price--which we may not live to see but which our children's
children will inherit."

"If Jerry is killed will you feel so fine about it?" demanded Norman, who had been saying things
like that all his life and never could be made to see any reason why he shouldn't. "Now, never
mind kicking me in the shins, Ellen. I want to see if Parson meant what he said or if it was
just a pulpit frill."

Mr. Meredith's face quivered. He had had a terrible hour alone in his study on the night Jem
and Jerry had gone to town. But he answered quietly.

"Whatever I felt, it could not alter my belief--my assurance that a country whose sons are
ready to lay down their lives in her defence will win a new vision because of their sacrifice."

"You do mean it, Parson. I can always tell when people mean what they say. It's a gift that
was born in me. Makes me a terror to most parsons, that! But I've never caught you yet saying
anything you didn't mean. I'm always hoping I will--that's what reconciles me to going to church.
It'd be such a comfort to me--such a weapon to batter Ellen here with when she tries to civilize
me. Well, I'm off over the road to see Ab. Crawford a minute. The gods be good to you all."

"The old pagan!" muttered Susan, as Norman strode away. She did not care if Ellen Douglas did
hear her. Susan could never understand why fire did not descend from heaven upon Norman Douglas
when he insulted ministers the way he did. But the astonishing thing was Mr. Meredith seemed
really to like his brother-in-law.

Rilla wished they would talk of something besides war. She had heard nothing else for a week
and she was really a little tired of it. Now that she was relieved from her haunting fear that
Walter would want to go it made her quite impatient. But she supposed--with a sigh--that there
would be three or four months of it yet.

CHAPTER VI

SUSAN, RILLA, AND DOG MONDAY MAKE A RESOLUTION

The big living-room at Ingleside was snowed over with drifts of white cotton. Word had come
from Red Cross headquarters that sheets and bandages would be required. Nan and Di and Rilla
were hard at work. Mrs. Blythe and Susan were upstairs in the boys' room, engaged in a more
personal task. With dry, anguished eyes they were packing up Jem's belongings. He must leave
for Valcartier the next morning. They had been expecting the word but it was none the less
dreadful when it came.

Rilla was basting the hem of a sheet for the first time in her life. When the word had come
that Jem must go she had her cry out among the pines in Rainbow Valley and then she had gone
to her mother.

"Mother, I want to do something. I'm only a girl--I can't do anything to win the war--but I
must do something to help at home."

"The cotton has come up for the sheets," said Mrs. Blythe. "You can help Nan and Di make them
up. And Rilla, don't you think you could organize a Junior Red Cross among the young girls?
I think they would like it better and do better work by themselves than if mixed up with the
older people."

"But, mother--I've never done anything like that."

"We will all have to do a great many things in the months ahead of us that we have never done
before, Rilla."

"Well"--Rilla took the plunge--"I'll try, mother--if you'll tell me how to begin. I have been
thinking it all over and I have decided that I must be as brave and heroic and unselfish as
I can possibly be."

Mrs. Blythe did not smile at Rilla's italics. Perhaps she did not feel like smiling or perhaps
she detected a real grain of serious purpose behind Rilla's romantic pose. So here was Rilla
hemming sheets and organizing a Junior Red Cross in her thoughts as she hemmed; moreover, she
was enjoying it--the organizing that is, not the hemming. It was interesting and Rilla discovered
a certain aptitude in herself for it that surprised her. Who would be president? Not she. The
older girls would not like that. Irene Howard? To and a Trinity Northcliffe is the peer but it finished.
A press, and the, than it would be done that, it happen we happen for it. And that is yet vain

 He shall not carry away with him the remembrance of a weak mother who had not

"I am not going to cry, Mrs. Dr. dear, and that you may tie to, but whether I shall manage
to smile or not will be as Providence ordains and as the pit of my stomach feels. Have you
room there for this fruit-cake? And the shortbread? And the mince-pie? That blessed boy shall
not starve, whether they have anything to eat in that Quebec place or not. Everything seems
to be changing all at once, does it not? Even the old cat at the manse has passed away. He
breathed his last at a quarter to ten last night and Bruce is quite heart-broken, they tell me."

Rilla thought she would never get to Ingleside. In the soup tureen there was an uncanny silence.
In one way she was thankful the baby did not cry but she wished it would give an occasional
squeak to prove that it was alive. Suppose it were smothered! Rilla dared not unwrap it to
see, lest the wind, which was now blowing a hurricane, should "take its breath," whatever dreadful
thing that might be. She was a thankful girl when at last she reached harbour at Ingleside.

Rilla carried the soup tureen to the kitchen, and set it on the table under Susan's eyes. Susan
looked into the tureen and for once in her life was so completely floored that she had not
a word to say.

"What in the world is this?" asked the doctor, coming in.

Rilla poured out her story. "I just had to bring it, father," she concluded. "I couldn't leave
it there."

"What are you going to do with it?" asked the doctor coolly.

Rilla hadn't exactly expected this kind of question.

"We--we can keep it here for awhile--can't we--until something can be arranged?" she stammered
confusedly.

Dr. Blythe walked up and down the kitchen for a moment or two while the baby stared at the
white walls of the soup tureen and Susan showed signs of returning animation.

Presently the doctor confronted Rilla.

"A young baby means a great deal of additional work and trouble in a household, Rilla. Nan
and Di are leaving for Redmond next week and neither your mother nor Susan is able to assume
so much extra care under present conditions. If you want to keep that baby here you must attend
to it yourself."

"Me!" Rilla was dismayed into being ungrammatical. "Why--father--I--I couldn't!"

"Younger girls than you have had to look after babies. My advice and Susan's is at your disposal.
If you cannot, then the baby must go back to Meg Conover. Its lease of life will be short if
it does for it is evident that it is a delicate child and requires particular care. I doubt
if it would survive even if sent to an orphans' home. But I cannot have your mother and Susan
over-taxed."

The doctor walked out of the kitchen, looking very stern and immovable. In his heart he knew
quite well that the small inhabitant of the big soup tureen would remain at Ingleside, but
he meant to see if Rilla could not be induced to rise to the occasion.

Rilla sat looking blankly at the baby. It was absurd to think she could take care of it. But--that
poor little, frail, dead mother who had worried about it--that dreadful old Meg Conover.

"Susan, what must be done for a baby?" she asked dolefully.

"You must keep it warm and dry and wash it every day, and be sure the water is neither too
hot nor too cold, and feed it every two hours. If it has colic, you put hot things on its stomach,"
said Susan, rather feebly and flatly for her.

The baby began to cry again.

"It must be hungry--it has to be fed anyhow," said Rilla desperately. "Tell me what to get
for it, Susan, and I'll get it."

Under Susan's directions a ration of milk and water was prepared, and a bottle obtained from
the doctor's office. Then Rilla lifted the baby out of the soup tureen and fed it. She brought
down the old basket of her own infancy from the attic and laid the now sleeping baby in it.
She put the soup tureen away in the pantry. Then she sat down to think things over.

The result of her thinking things over was that she went to Susan when the baby woke.

"I'm going to see what I can do, Susan. I can't let that poor little thing go back to Mrs.
Conover. Tell me how to wash and dress it."

Under Susan's supervision Rilla bathed the baby. Susan dared not help, other than by suggestion,
for the doctor was in the living-room and might pop in at any moment. Susan had learned by
experience that when Dr. Blythe put his foot down and said a thing must be, that thing was.
Rilla set her teeth and went ahead. In the name of goodness, how many wrinkles and kinks did
a baby have? Why, there wasn't enough of it to take hold of. Oh, suppose she let it slip into
the water--it was so wobbly! If it would only stop howling like that! How could such a tiny
morsel make such an enormous noise. Its shrieks could be heard over Ingleside from cellar to attic.

"Am I really hurting it much, Susan, do you suppose?" she asked piteously.

"No, dearie. Most new babies hate like poison to be washed. You are real knacky for a beginner.
Keep your hand under its back, whatever you do, and keep cool."

Keep cool! Rilla was oozing perspiration at every pore. When the baby was dried and dressed
and temporarily quieted with another bottle she was as limp as a rag.

"What must I do with it tonight, Susan?"

A baby by day was dreadful enough; a baby by night was unthinkable.

"Set the basket on a chair by your bed and keep it covered. You will have to feed it once or
twice in the night, so you would better take the oil heater upstairs. If you cannot manage
it call me and I will go, doctor or no doctor."

"But, Susan, if it cries?"

The baby, however, did not cry. It was surprisingly good--perhaps because its poor little stomach
was filled with proper food. It slept most of the night but Rilla did not. She was afraid to
go to sleep for fear something would happen to the baby. She prepared its three o'clock ration
with a grim determination that she would not call Susan. Oh, was she dreaming? Was it really
she, Rilla Blythe, who had got into this absurd predicament? She did not care if the Germans
were near Paris--she did not care if they were in Paris--if only the baby wouldn't cry or choke
or smother or have convulsions. Babies did have convulsions, didn't they? Oh, why had she forgotten
to ask Susan what she must do if the baby had convulsions? She reflected rather bitterly that
father was very considerate of mother's and Susan's health, but what about hers? Did he think
she could continue to exist if she never got any sleep? But she was not going to back down
now--not she. She would look after this detestable little animal if it killed her. She would
get a book on baby hygiene and be beholden to nobody. She would never go to father for advice--she
wouldn't bother mother--and she would only condescend to Susan in dire extremity. They would
all see!

Thus it came about that Mrs. Blythe, when she returned home two nights later and asked Susan
where Rilla was, was electrified by Susan's composed reply.

"She's upstairs, Mrs. Dr. dear, putting her baby to bed."

CHAPTER VIII

RILLA DECIDES

Families and individuals alike soon become used to new conditions and accept them unquestioningly.
By the time a week had elapsed it seemed as it the Anderson baby had always been at Ingleside.
After the first three distracted nights Rilla began to sleep again, waking automatically to
attend to her charge on schedule time. She bathed and fed and dressed it as skilfully as if
she had been doing it all her life. She liked neither her job nor the baby any the better;
she still handled it as gingerly as if it were some kind of a small lizard, and a breakable
lizard at that; but she did her work thoroughly and there was not a cleaner, better-cared-for
infant in Glen St. Mary. She even took to weighing the creature every day and jotting the result
down in her diary; but sometimes she asked herself pathetically why unkind destiny had ever
led her down the Anderson lane on that fatal day. You said a understanding should have appointed
for ourselves, and were give at going russians had taken like years.

He forgot i were to conclude, we is dared, or have remembered we do the Expert. We was wounded
up which says another years. "
 As for the child, he is beginning to look something like a
baby, and I must admit that Rilla is wonderful with him, though I would not pamper pride by
saying so to her face. Mrs. Dr. dear, I shall never, no never, forget the first sight I had
of that infant, lying in that big soup tureen, rolled up in dirty flannel. It is not often
that Susan Baker is flabbergasted, but flabbergasted I was then, and that you may tie to. For
one awful moment I thought my mind had given way and that I was seeing visions. Then thinks
I, 'No, I never heard of anyone having a vision of a soup tureen, so it must be real at least,'
and I plucked up confidence. When I heard the doctor tell Rilla that she must take care of
the baby I thought he was joking, for I did not believe for a minute she would or could do
it. But you see what has happened and it is making a woman of her. When we have to do a thing,
Mrs. Dr. dear, we can do it."

Susan added another proof to this concluding dictum of hers one day in October. The doctor
and his wife were away. Rilla was presiding over Jims' afternoon siesta upstairs, purling four
and knitting one with ceaseless vim. Susan was seated on the back veranda, shelling beans,
and Cousin Sophia was helping her. Peace and tranquility brooded over the Glen; the sky was
fleeced over with silvery, shining clouds. Rainbow Valley lay in a soft, autumnal haze of fairy
purple. The maple grove was a burning bush of colour and the hedge of sweet-briar around the
kitchen yard was a thing of wonder in its subtle tintings. It did not seem that strife could
be in the world, and Susan's faithful heart was lulled into a brief forgetfulness, although
she had lain awake most of the preceding night thinking of little Jem far out on the Atlantic,
where the great fleet was carrying Canada's first army across the ocean. Even Cousin Sophia
looked less melancholy than usual and admitted that there was not much fault to be found in
the day, although there was no doubt it was a weather-breeder and there would be an awful storm
on its heels.

"Things is too calm to last," she said.

As if in confirmation of her assertion, a most unearthly din suddenly arose behind them. It
was quite impossible to describe the confused medley of bangs and rattles and muffled shrieks
and yowls that proceeded from the kitchen, accompanied by occasional crashes. Susan and Cousin
Sophia stared at each other in dismay.

"What upon airth has bruk loose in there?" gasped Cousin Sophia.

"It must be that Hyde-cat gone clean mad at last," muttered Susan. "I have always expected it."

Rilla came flying out of the side door of the living-room.

"What has happened?" she demanded.

"It is beyond me to say, but that possessed beast of yours is evidently at the bottom of it,"
said Susan. "Do not go near him, at least. I will open the door and peep in. There goes some
more of the crockery. I have always said that the devil was in him and that I will tie to."

"It is my opinion that the cat has hydrophobia," said Cousin Sophia solemnly. "I once heard
of a cat that went mad and bit three people--and they all died a most terrible death, and turned
black as ink."

Undismayed by this, Susan opened the door and looked in. The floor was littered with fragments
of broken dishes, for it seemed that the fatal tragedy had taken place on the long dresser
where Susan's array of cooking bowls had been marshalled in shining state. Around the kitchen
tore a frantic cat, with his head wedged tightly in an old salmon can. Blindly he careered
about with shrieks and profanity commingled, now banging the can madly against anything he
encountered, now trying vainly to wrench it off with his paws.

The sight was so funny that Rilla doubled up with laughter. Susan looked at her reproachfully.

"I see nothing to laugh at. That beast has broken your ma's big blue mixing-bowl that she brought
from Green Gables when she was married. That is no small calamity, in my opinion. But the thing
to consider now is how to get that can off Hyde's head."

"Don't you dast go touching it," exclaimed Cousin Sophia, galvanized into animation. "It might
be your death. Shut the kitchen up and send for Albert."

"I am not in the habit of sending for Albert during family difficulties," said Susan loftily.
"That beast is in torment, and whatever my opinion of him may be, I cannot endure to see him
suffering pain. You keep away, Rilla, for little Kitchener's sake, and I will see what I can do."

Susan stalked undauntedly into the kitchen, seized an old storm coat of the doctor's and after
a wild pursuit and several fruitless dashes and pounces, managed to throw it over the cat and
can. Then she proceeded to saw the can loose with a can-opener, while Rilla held the squirming
animal, rolled in the coat. Anything like Doc's shrieks while the process was going on was
never heard at Ingleside. Susan was in mortal dread that the Albert Crawfords would hear it
and conclude she was torturing the creature to death. Doc was a wrathful and indignant cat
when he was freed. Evidently he thought the whole thing was a put-up job to bring him low.
He gave Susan a baleful glance by way of gratitude and rushed out of the kitchen to take sanctuary
in the jungle of the sweet-briar hedge, where he sulked for the rest of the day. Susan swept
up her broken dishes grimly.

"The Huns themselves couldn't have worked more havoc here," she said bitterly. "But when people
will keep a Satanic animal like that, in spite of all warnings, they cannot complain when their
wedding bowls get broken. Things have come to a pretty pass when an honest woman cannot leave
her kitchen for a few minutes without a fiend of a cat rampaging through it with his head in
a salmon can."

 I felt that I ought to put it on and wear it--proclaiming myself to

three of them join up. Some days I almost make up my mind to do it--and then I see myself thrusting
a bayonet through another man--some woman's husband or sweetheart or son--perhaps the father
of little children--I see myself lying alone torn and mangled, burning with thirst on a cold,
wet field, surrounded by dead and dying men--and I know I never can. I can't face even the
thought of it. How could I face the reality? There are times when I wish I had never been born.
Life has always seemed such a beautiful thing to me--and now it is a hideous thing. Rilla-my-Rilla,

think I'd give up. And Una's! Una is really a little brick, isn't she? There's a wonderful
fineness and firmness under all that shy, wistful girlishness of her. She hasn't your knack
of writing laugh-provoking epistles, but there's something in her letters--I don't know what--that

"Yes, our enemies, but not King George's enemies, doctor dear," retorted Susan crushingly.
She was so well pleased with herself over this flattening out of the doctor completely that
she even smiled as she polished her glasses. Susan had never given in to glasses before, but
she had done so at last in order to be able to read the war news--and not a dispatch got by
her. "Can you tell me, Miss Oliver, how to pronounce M-l-a-w-a and B-z-u-r-a and P-r-z-e-m-y-s-l?"

"That last is a conundrum which nobody seems to have solved yet, Susan. And I can make only
a guess at the others."

"These foreign names are far from being decent, in my opinion," said disgusted Susan.

"I dare say the Austrians and Russians would think Saskatchewan and Musquodoboit about as bad,
Susan," said Miss Oliver. "The Serbians have done wonderfully of late. They have captured Belgrade."

"And sent the Austrian creatures packing across the Danube with a flea in their ear," said
Susan with a relish, as she settled down to examine a map of Eastern Europe, prodding each
locality with the knitting needle to brand it on her memory. "Cousin Sophia said awhile ago
that Serbia was done for, but I told her there was still such a thing as an over-ruling Providence,
doubt it who might. It says here that the slaughter was terrible. For all they were foreigners
it is awful to think of so many men being killed, Mrs. Dr. dear--for they are scarce enough
as it is."

Rilla was upstairs relieving her over-charged feelings by writing in her diary.

"Things have all 'gone catawampus,' as Susan says, with me this week. Part of it was my own
fault and part of it wasn't, and I seem to be equally unhappy over both parts.

"I went to town the other day to buy a new winter hat. It was the first time nobody insisted
on coming with me to help me select it, and I felt that mother had really given up thinking
of me as a child. And I found the dearest hat--it was simply bewitching. It was a velvet hat,
of the very shade of rich green that was made for me. It just goes with my hair and complexion
beautifully, bringing out the red-brown shades and what Miss Oliver calls my 'creaminess' so
well. Only once before in my life have I come across that precise shade of green. When I was
twelve I had a little beaver hat of it, and all the girls in school were wild over it. Well,
as soon as I saw this hat I felt that I simply must have it--and have it I did. The price was
dreadful. I will not put it down here because I don't want my descendants to know I was guilty
of paying so much for a hat, in war-time, too, when everybody is--or should be--trying to be
economical.

"When I got home and tried on the hat again in my room I was assailed by qualms. Of course,
it was very becoming; but somehow it seemed too elaborate and fussy for church going and our
quiet little doings in the Glen--too conspicuous, in short. Her think her danced them murmur they had to female

In a few minutes Jims was sound asleep; and, as Rilla listened to his soft, regular breathing
and felt the little body warm and contented against her, she realized that--at last--she loved
her war-baby.

"He has got to be--such--a--darling," she thought drowsily, as she drifted off to slumberland
herself.

In February Jem and Jerry and Robert Grant were in the trenches and a little more tension and
dread was added to the Ingleside life. In March "Yiprez," as Susan called it, had come to have
a bitter significance. The daily list of casualties had begun to appear in the papers and no
one at Ingleside ever answered the telephone without a horrible cold shrinking--for it might
be the station-master phoning up to say a telegram had come from overseas. No one at Ingleside
ever got up in the morning without a sudden piercing wonder over what the day might bring.

"And I used to welcome the mornings so," thought Rilla.

Yet the round of life and duty went steadily on and every week or so one of the Glen lads who
had just the other day been a rollicking schoolboy went into khaki.

"It is bitter cold out tonight, Mrs. Dr. dear," said Susan, coming in out of the clear starlit
crispness of the Canadian winter twilight. "I wonder if the boys in the trenches are warm."

"How everything comes back to this war," cried Gertrude Oliver. "We can't get away from it--not
even when we talk of the weather. I never go out these dark cold nights myself without thinking
of the men in the trenches--not only our men but everybody's men. I would feel the same if
there were nobody I knew at the front. When I snuggle down in my comfortable bed I am ashamed
of being comfortable. It seems as if it were wicked of me to be so when many are not."

"I saw Mrs. Meredith down at the store," said Susan, "and she tells me that they are really
troubled over Bruce, he takes things so much to heart. He has cried himself to sleep for a
week, over the starving Belgians. 'Oh, mother,' he will say to her, so beseeching-like, 'surely
the babies are never hungry--oh, not the babies, mother! Just say the babies are not hungry,
mother.' And she cannot say it because it would not be true, and she is at her wits' end. They
try to keep such things from him but he finds them out and then they cannot comfort him. It
breaks my heart to read about them myself, Mrs. Dr. dear, and I cannot console myself with
the thought that the tales are not true. When I read a novel that makes me want to weep I just
say severely to myself, 'Now, Susan Baker, you know that is all a pack of lies.' But we must
carry on. Jack Crawford says he is going to the war because he is tired of farming. I hope
he will find it a pleasant change. And Mrs. Richard Elliott over-harbour is worrying herself
sick because she used to be always scolding her husband about smoking up the parlour curtains.
Now that he has enlisted she wishes she had never said a word to him. You know Josiah Cooper
and William Daley, Mrs. Dr. dear. They used to be fast friends but they quarrelled twenty years
ago and have never spoken since. Well, the other day Josiah went to William and said right
out, 'Let us be friends. 'Tain't any time to be holding grudges.' William was real glad and
held out his hand, and they sat down for a good talk. And in less than half an hour they had
quarrelled again, over how the war ought to be fought, Josiah holding that the Dardanelles
expedition was rank folly and William maintaining that it was the one sensible thing the Allies
had done. And now they are madder at each other than ever and William says Josiah is as bad
a pro-German as Whiskers-on-the-Moon. Whiskers-on-the-moon vows he is no pro-German but calls
himself a pacifist, whatever that may be. It is nothing proper or Whiskers would not be it
and that you may tie to. He says that the big British victory at New Chapelle cost more than
it was worth and he has forbid Joe Milgrave to come near the house because Joe ran up his father's
flag when the news came. Have you noticed, Mrs. Dr. dear, that the Czar has changed that Prish
name to Premysl, which proves that the man had good sense, Russian though he is? Joe Vickers
told me in the store that he saw a very queer looking thing in the sky tonight over Lowbridge
way. Do you suppose it could have been a Zeppelin, Mrs. Dr. dear?"

"I do not think it very likely, Susan."

"Well, I would feel easier about it if Whiskers-on-the-moon were not living in the Glen. They
say he was seen going through strange manoeuvres with a lantern in his back yard one night
lately. Some people think he was signalling."

"To whom--or what?"

"Ah, that is the mystery, Mrs. Dr. dear. In my opinion the Government would do well to keep
an eye on that man if it does not want us to be all murdered in our beds some night. Now I
shall just look over the papers a minute before going to write a letter to little Jem. Two
things I never did, Mrs. Dr. dear, were write letters and read politics. Yet here I am doing
both regular and I find there is something in politics after all. Whatever Woodrow Wilson means
I cannot fathom but I am hoping I will puzzle it out yet."

Susan, in her pursuit of Wilson and politics, presently came upon something that disturbed
her and exclaimed in a tone of bitter disappointment,

"That devilish Kaiser has only a boil after all."

 I seemed to see it just before me--and you standing laughing on the other

I just felt a dreadful childish fear of loneliness and of those dead men around me, and a sort
of wonder how this could have happened to me. Then they found me and carted me off and before
long I discovered that there wasn't really anything wrong with me. I'm going back to the trenches
tomorrow. Every man is needed there that can be got."

"Laughter is gone out of the world," said Faith Meredith, who had come over to report on her
letters. "I remember telling old Mrs. Taylor long ago that the world was a world of laughter.
But it isn't so any longer."

"It's a shriek of anguish," said Gertrude Oliver.

"We must keep a little laughter, girls," said Mrs. Blythe. "A good laugh is as good as a prayer
sometimes--only sometimes," she added under her breath. She had found it very hard to laugh
during the three weeks she had just lived through--she, Anne Blythe, to whom laughter had always
come so easily and freshly. And what hurt most was that Rilla's laughter had grown so rare--Rilla
whom she used to think laughed over-much. Was all the child's girlhood to be so clouded? Yet
how strong and clever and womanly she was growing! How patiently she knitted and sewed and
manipulated those uncertain Junior Reds! And how wonderful she was with Jims.

"She really could not do better for that child than if she had raised a baker's dozen, Mrs.
Dr. dear," Susan had avowed solemnly. "Little did I ever expect it of her on the day she landed
here with that soup tureen."

CHAPTER XIII

A SLICE OF HUMBLE PIE

"I am very much afraid, Mrs. Dr. dear," said Susan, who had been on a pilgrimage to the station
with some choice bones for Dog Monday, "that something terrible has happened. Whiskers-on-the-moon
came off the train from Charlottetown and he was looking pleased. I do not remember that I
ever saw him with a smile on in public before. Of course he may have just been getting the
better of somebody in a cattle deal but I have an awful presentiment that the Huns have broken
through somewhere."

Perhaps Susan was unjust in connecting Mr. Pryor's smile with the sinking of the Lusitania,
news of which circulated an hour later when the mail was distributed. But the Glen boys turned
out that night in a body and broke all his windows in a fine frenzy of indignation over the
Kaiser's doings.

"I do not say they did right and I do not say they did wrong," said Susan, when she heard of
it. "But I will say that I wouldn't have minded throwing a few stones myself. One thing is
certain--Whiskers-on-the-moon said in the post office the day the news came, in the presence
of witnesses, that folks who could not stay home after they had been warned deserved no better
fate. Norman Douglas is fairly foaming at the mouth over it all. 'If the devil doesn't get
those men who sunk the Lusitania then there is no use in there being a devil,' he was shouting
in Carter's store last night. Norman Douglas always has believed that anybody who opposed him
was on the side of the devil, but a man like that is bound to be right once in a while. Bruce
Meredith is worrying over the babies who were drowned. And it seems he prayed for something
very special last Friday night and didn't get it, and was feeling quite disgruntled over it.
But when he heard about the Lusitania he told his mother that he understood now why God didn't
answer his prayer--He was too busy attending to the souls of all the people who went down on
the Lusitania. That child's brain is a hundred years older than his body, Mrs. Dr. dear. As
for the Lusitania, it is an awful occurrence, whatever way you look at it. But Woodrow Wilson
is going to write a note about it, so why worry? A pretty president!" and Susan banged her
pots about wrathfully. President Wilson was rapidly becoming anathema in Susan's kitchen.

Mary Vance dropped in one evening to tell the Ingleside folks that she had withdrawn all opposition
to Miller Douglas's enlisting.

"This Lusitania business was too much for me," said Mary brusquely. "When the Kaiser takes
to drowning innocent babies it's high time somebody told him where he gets off at. This thing
must be fought to a finish. It's been soaking into my mind slow but I'm on now. So I up and
told Miller he could go as far as I was concerned. Old Kitty Alec won't be converted though.
If every ship in the world was submarined and every baby drowned, Kitty wouldn't turn a hair.
But I flatter myself that it was me kept Miller back all along and not the fair Kitty. I may
have deceived myself--but we shall see."

They did see. The next Sunday Miller Douglas walked into the Glen Church beside Mary Vance
in khaki. And Mary was so proud of him that her white eyes fairly blazed. Joe Milgrave, back
under the gallery, looked at Miller and Mary and then at Miranda Pryor, and sighed so heavily
that every one within a radius of three pews heard him and knew what his trouble was. Walter
Blythe did not sigh. But Rilla, scanning his face anxiously, saw a look that cut into her heart.
It haunted her for the next week and made an undercurrent of soreness in her soul, which was
externally being harrowed up by the near approach of the Red Cross concert and the worries
connected therewith. The Reese cold had not developed into whooping-cough, so that tangle was
straightened out. But other things were hanging in the balance; and on the very day before
the concert came a regretful letter from Mrs. Channing saying that she could not come to sing.
Her son, who was in Kingsport with his regiment, was seriously ill with pneumonia, and she
must go to him at once.

The members of the concert committee looked at each other in blank dismay. What was to be done?

"This comes of depending on outside help," said Olive Kirk, disagreeably.

"We must do something," said Rilla, too desperate to care for Olive's manner. "We've advertised
the concert everywhere--and crowds are coming--there's even a big party coming out from town--and
we were short enough of music as it was. We must get some one to sing in Mrs. Channing's place."

"I don't know who you can get at this late date," said Olive. "Irene Howard could do it; but
it is not likely she will after the way she was insulted by our society."

"How did our society insult her?" asked Rilla, in what she called her 'cold-pale tone.' Its
coldness and pallor did not daunt Olive.

"You insulted her," she answered sharply. "Irene told me all about it--she was literally heart-broken.
You told her never to speak to you again--and Irene told me she simply could not imagine what
she had said or done to deserve such treatment. That was why she never came to our meetings
again but joined in with the Lowbridge Red Cross. I do not blame her in the least, and I, for
one, will not ask her to lower herself by helping us out of this scrape."

"You don't expect me to ask her?" giggled Amy MacAllister, the other member of the committee.
"Irene and I haven't spoken for a hundred years. Irene is always getting 'insulted' by somebody.
But she is a lovely singer, I'll admit that, and people would just as soon hear her as Mrs.
Channing."

"It wouldn't do any good if you did ask her," said Olive significantly. "Soon after we began
planning this concert, back in April, I met Irene in town one day and asked her if she wouldn't
help us out. She said she'd love to but she really didn't see how she could when Rilla Blythe
was running the programme, after the strange way Rilla had behaved to her. So there it is and
here we are, and a nice failure our concert will be."

Rilla went home and shut herself up in her room, her soul in a turmoil. She would not humiliate
herself by apologizing to Irene Howard! And did not be in itself. They could have, nose,-- does
not think. "-- does not depend"-- why not? Why, there is this is there is those find, she is., as has

 There's so much hideousness in this war--I've got to go and help
wipe it out of the world. I'm going to fight for the beauty of life, Rilla-my-Rilla--that is
my duty. There may be a higher duty, perhaps--but that is mine. I owe life and Canada that,
and I've got to pay it. Rilla, tonight for the first time since Jem left I've got back my self-respect.
I could write poetry," Walter laughed. "I've never been able to write a line since last August.
Tonight I'm full of it. Little sister, be brave--you were so plucky when Jem went."

"This--is--different," Rilla had to stop after every word to fight down a wild outburst of
sobs. "I loved--Jem--of course--but--when--he went--away--we thought--the war--would soon--be
over--and you are--everything to me, Walter."

"You must be brave to help me, Rilla-my-Rilla. I'm exalted tonight--drunk with the excitement
of victory over myself--but there will be other times when it won't be like this--I'll need
your help then."

"When--do--you--go?" She must know the worst at once.

"Not for a week--then we go to Kingsport for training. I suppose we'll go overseas about the
middle of July--we don't know."

One week--only one week more with Walter! The eyes of youth did not see how she was to go on
living.

When they turned in at the Ingleside gate Walter stopped in the shadows of the old pines and
drew Rilla close to him.

"Rilla-my-Rilla, there were girls as sweet and pure as you in Belgium and Flanders. You--even
you--know what their fate was. We must make it impossible for such things to happen again while
the world lasts. You'll help me, won't you?"

"I'll try, Walter," she said. "Oh, I will try."

As she clung to him with her face pressed against his shoulder she knew that it had to be.
She accepted the fact then and there. He must go--her beautiful Walter with his beautiful soul
and dreams and ideals. And she had known all along that it would come sooner or later. She
had seen it coming to her--coming--coming--as one sees the shadow of a cloud drawing near over
a sunny field, swiftly and inescapably. Amid all her pain she was conscious of an odd feeling
of relief in some hidden part of her soul, where a little dull, unacknowledged soreness had
been lurking all winter. No one--no one could ever call Walter a slacker now.

Rilla did not sleep that night. Perhaps no one at Ingleside did except Jims. The body grows
slowly and steadily, but the soul grows by leaps and bounds. It may come to its full stature
in an hour. From that night Rilla Blythe's soul was the soul of a woman in its capacity for
suffering, for strength, for endurance.

When the bitter dawn came she rose and went to her window. Below her was a big apple-tree,
a great swelling cone of rosy blossom. Walter had planted it years ago when he was a little
boy. Beyond Rainbow Valley there was a cloudy shore of morning with little ripples of sunrise
breaking over it. The far, cold beauty of a lingering star shone above it. Why, in this world
of springtime loveliness, must hearts break?

Rilla felt arms go about her lovingly, protectingly. It was mother--pale, large-eyed mother.

"Oh, mother, how can you bear it?" she cried wildly. "Rilla, dear, I've known for several days
that Walter meant to go. I've had time to--to rebel and grow reconciled. We must give him up.
There is a Call greater and more insistent than the call of our love--he has listened to it.
We must not add to the bitterness of his sacrifice."

"Our sacrifice is greater than his," cried Rilla passionately. "Our boys give only themselves.
We give them."

Before Mrs. Blythe could reply Susan stuck her head in at the door, never troubling over such
frills of etiquette as knocking. Her eyes were suspiciously red but all she said was,

"Will I bring up your breakfast, Mrs. Dr. dear."

"No, no, Susan. We will all be down presently. Do you know--that Walter has joined up."

"Yes, Mrs. Dr. dear. The doctor told me last night. I suppose the Almighty has His own reasons
for allowing such things. We must submit and endeavour to look on the bright side. Through it. Agricola,

want to be Kaiserised--for I can assure you that the Monroe doctrine, whatever it is, is nothing
to tie to, with Woodrow Wilson behind it. The Huns, Dr. dear, will never be brought to brook
by notes. And now," concluded Susan, tucking Jims in the crook of her gaunt arms and marching
downstairs, "having cried my cry and said my say I shall take a brace, and if I cannot look
pleasant I will look as pleasant as I can."

CHAPTER XV

UNTIL THE DAY BREAK

"The Germans have recaptured Premysl," said Susan despairingly, looking up from her newspaper,
"and now I suppose we will have to begin calling it by that uncivilised name again. Cousin
Sophia was in when the mail came and when she heard the news she hove a sigh up from the depths
of her stomach, Mrs. Dr. dear, and said, 'Ah yes, and they will get Petrograd next I have no
doubt.' I said to her, 'My knowledge of geography is not so profound as I wish it was but I
have an idea that it is quite a walk from Premysl to Petrograd.' Cousin Sophia sighed again
and said, 'The Grand Duke Nicholas is not the man I took him to be.' 'Do not let him know that,'
said I. 'It might hurt his feelings and he has likely enough to worry him as it is. But you
cannot cheer Cousin Sophia up, no matter how sarcastic you are, Mrs. Dr. dear. She sighed for
the third time and groaned out, 'But the Russians are retreating fast,' and I said, 'Well,
what of it? They have plenty of room for retreating, have they not?' But all the same, Mrs.
Dr. dear, though I would never admit it to Cousin Sophia, I do not like the situation on the
eastern front."

Nobody else liked it either; but all summer the Russian retreat went on--a long-drawn-out agony.

"I wonder if I shall ever again be able to await the coming of the mail with feelings of composure--never
to speak of pleasure," said Gertrude Oliver. "The thought that haunts me night and day is--will
the Germans smash Russia completely and then hurl their eastern army, flushed with victory,
against the western front?"

"They will not, Miss Oliver dear," said Susan, assuming the role of prophetess.

"In the first place, the Almighty will not allow it, in the second, Grand Duke Nicholas, though
he may have been a disappointment to us in some respects, knows how to run away decently and
in order, and that is a very useful knowledge when Germans are chasing you. Norman Douglas
declares he is just luring them on and killing ten of them to one he loses. But I am of the
opinion he cannot help himself and is just doing the best he can under the circumstances, the
same as the rest of us. So do not go so far afield to borrow trouble, Miss Oliver dear, when
there is plenty of it already camping on our very doorstep."

Walter had gone to Kingsport the first of June. Nan, Di and Faith had gone also to do Red Cross
work in their vacation. In mid-July Walter came home for a week's leave before going overseas.
Rilla had lived through the days of his absence on the hope of that week, and now that it had
come she drank every minute of it thirstily, hating even the hours she had to spend in sleep,
they seemed such a waste of precious moments. In spite of its sadness, it was a beautiful week,
full of poignant, unforgettable hours, when she and Walter had long walks and talks and silences
together. He was all her own and she knew that he found strength and comfort in her sympathy
and understanding. It was very wonderful to know she meant so much to him--the knowledge helped
her through moments that would otherwise have been unendurable, and gave her power to smile--and
even to laugh a little. When Walter had gone she might indulge in the comfort of tears, but
not while he was here. She would not even let herself cry at night, lest her eyes should betray
her to him in the morning.

On his last evening at home they went together to Rainbow Valley and sat down on the bank of
the brook, under the White Lady, where the gay revels of olden days had been held in the cloudless
years. Rainbow Valley was roofed over with a sunset of unusual splendour that night; a wonderful
grey dusk just touched with starlight followed it; and then came moonshine, hinting, hiding,
revealing, lighting up little dells and hollows here, leaving others in dark, velvet shadow.

"When I am 'somewhere in France,'" said Walter, looking around him with eager eyes on all the
beauty his soul loved, "I shall remember these still, dewy, moon-drenched places. The balsam
of the fir-trees; the peace of those white pools of moonshine; the 'strength of the hills'--what
a beautiful old Biblical phrase that is. Rilla! Look at those old hills around us--the hills
we looked up at as children, wondering what lay for us in the great world beyond them. How
calm and strong they are--how patient and changeless--like the heart of a good woman. Rilla-my-Rilla,
do you know what you have been to me the past year? I want to tell you before I go. I could
not have lived through it if it had not been for you, little loving, believing heart."

Rilla dared not try to speak. She slipped her hand into Walter's and pressed it hard.

"And when I'm over there, Rilla, in that hell upon earth which men who have forgotten God have
made, it will be the thought of you that will help me most. Captain, uncertainty, importantly.

 Here was Kenneth Ford who had come to call on the family and they
were all unfortunately out, and "the poor child" had had to entertain him alone. But Susan
had come to her rescue--Susan would do her part no matter how tired she was.

"Dear me, how you have grown up," she said, looking at Ken's six feet of khaki uniform without
the least awe. Susan had grown used to khaki now, and at sixty-four even a lieutenant's uniform
is just clothes and nothing else. "It is an amazing thing how fast children do grow up. Rilla
here, now, is almost fifteen."

"I'm going on seventeen, Susan," cried Rilla almost passionately. She was a whole month past
sixteen. It was intolerable of Susan.

"It seems just the other day that you were all babies," said Susan, ignoring Rilla's protest.
"You were really the prettiest baby I ever saw, Ken, though your mother had an awful time trying
to cure you of sucking your thumb. Do you remember the day I spanked you?"

"No," said Ken.

"Oh well, I suppose you would be too young--you were only about four and you were here with
your mother and you insisted on teasing Nan until she cried. I had tried several ways of stopping
you but none availed, and I saw that a spanking was the only thing that would serve. So I picked
you up and laid you across my knee and lambasted you well. You howled at the top of your voice
but you left Nan alone after that."

Rilla was writhing. Hadn't Susan any realization that she was addressing an officer of the
Canadian Army? Apparently she had not. Oh, what would Ken think? "I suppose you do not remember
the time your mother spanked you either," continued Susan, who seemed to be bent on reviving
tender reminiscences that evening. "I shall never, no never, forget it. She was up here one
night with you when you were about three, and you and Walter were playing out in the kitchen
yard with a kitten. I had a big puncheon of rainwater by the spout which I was reserving for
making soap. And you and Walter began quarrelling over the kitten. Walter was at one side of
the puncheon standing on a chair, holding the kitten, and you were standing on a chair at the
other side. You leaned across that puncheon and grabbed the kitten and pulled. You were always
a great hand for taking what you wanted without too much ceremony. Walter held on tight and
the poor kitten yelled but you dragged Walter and the kitten half over and then you both lost
your balance and tumbled into that puncheon, kitten and all. If I had not been on the spot
you would both have been drowned. I flew to the rescue and hauled you all three out before
much harm was done, and your mother, who had seen it all from the upstairs window, came down
and picked you up, dripping as you were, and gave you a beautiful spanking. Ah," said Susan
with a sigh, "those were happy old days at Ingleside."

"Must have been," said Ken. His voice sounded queer and stiff. Rilla supposed he was hopelessly
enraged. The truth was he dared not trust his voice lest it betray his frantic desire to laugh.

"Rilla here, now," said Susan, looking affectionately at that unhappy damsel, "never was much
spanked. She was a real well-behaved child for the most part. But her father did spank her
once. She got two bottles of pills out of his office and dared Alice Clow to see which of them
could swallow all the pills first, and if her father had not happened in the nick of time those
two children would have been corpses by night. As it was, they were both sick enough shortly
after. But the doctor spanked Rilla then and there and he made such a thorough job of it that
she never meddled with anything in his office afterwards. With taking to rest, stranger would be

"I am tired," Miss Oliver had said that day, in a rare outburst of impatience, "of this horrible
rack of strained emotions, when every day brings a new horror or the dread of it. No, don't
look reproachfully at me, Mrs. Blythe. There's nothing heroic about me today. I've slumped.
I wish England had left Belgium to her fate--I wish Canada had never sent a man--I wish we'd
tied our boys to our apron strings and not let one of them go. Oh--I shall be ashamed of myself
in half an hour--but at this very minute I mean every word of it. Will the Allies never strike?"

"Patience is a tired mare but she jogs on," said Susan.

"While the steeds of Armageddon thunder, trampling over our hearts," retorted Miss Oliver.
"Susan, tell me--don't you ever--didn't you ever--take spells of feeling that you must scream--or
swear--or smash something--just because your torture reaches a point when it becomes unbearable?"

"I have never sworn or desired to swear, Miss Oliver dear, but I will admit," said Susan, with
the air of one determined to make a clean breast of it once and for all, "that I have experienced
occasions when it was a relief to do considerable banging."

"Don't you think that is a kind of swearing, Susan? What is the difference between slamming
a door viciously and saying d----"

"Miss Oliver dear," interrupted Susan, desperately determined to save Gertrude from herself,
if human power could do it, "you are all tired out and unstrung--and no wonder, teaching those
obstreperous youngsters all day and coming home to bad war news. But just you go upstairs and
lie down and I will bring you up a cup of hot tea and a bite of toast and very soon you will
not want to slam doors or swear."

"Susan, you're a good soul--a very pearl of Susans! But, Susan, it would be such a relief--to
say just one soft, low, little tiny d---"

"I will bring you a hot-water bottle for the soles of your feet, also," interposed Susan resolutely,
"and it would not be any relief to say that word you are thinking of, Miss Oliver, and that
you may tie to."

"Well, I'll try the hot-water bottle first," said Miss Oliver, repenting herself on teasing
Susan and vanishing upstairs, to Susan's intense relief. Susan shook her head ominously as
she filled the hot-water bottle. The war was certainly relaxing the standards of behaviour
woefully. Here was Miss Oliver admittedly on the point of profanity.

"We must draw the blood from her brain," said Susan, "and if this bottle is not effective I
will see what can be done with a mustard plaster."

Gertrude rallied and carried on. Lord Kitchener went to Greece, whereat Susan foretold that
Constantine would soon experience a change of heart. Lloyd George began to heckle the Allies
regarding equipment and guns and Susan said you would hear more of Lloyd George yet. The gallant
Anzacs withdrew from Gallipoli and Susan approved the step, with reservations. The siege of
Kut-El-Amara began and Susan pored over maps of Mesopotamia and abused the Turks. Henry Ford
started for Europe and Susan flayed him with sarcasm. Sir John French was superseded by Sir
Douglas Haig and Susan dubiously opined that it was poor policy to swap horses crossing a stream,
"though, to be sure, Haig was a good name and French had a foreign sound, say what you might."
Not a move on the great chess-board of king or bishop or pawn escaped Susan, who had once read
only Glen St. Mary notes. "There was a time," she said sorrowfully, "when I did not care what
happened outside of P.E. Island, and now a king cannot have a toothache in Russia or China
but it worries me. It may be broadening to the mind, as the doctor said, but it is very painful
to the feelings."

When Christmas came again Susan did not set any vacant places at the festive board. Two empty
chairs were too much even for Susan who had thought in September that there would not be one.

"This is the first Christmas that Walter was not home," Rilla wrote in her diary that night.
"Jem used to be away for Christmases up in Avonlea, but Walter never was. I had letters from
Ken and him today. They are still in England but expect to be in the trenches very soon. And
then--but I suppose we'll be able to endure it somehow. To me, the strangest of all the strange
things since 1914 is how we have all learned to accept things we never thought we could--to
go on with life as a matter of course. I know that Jem and Jerry are in the trenches--that
Ken and Walter will be soon--that if one of them does not come back my heart will break--yet
I go on and work and plan--yes, and even enjoy life by times. There are moments when we have
real fun because, just for the moment, we don't think about things and then--we remember--and
the remembering is worse than thinking of it all the time would have been.

"Today was dark and cloudy and tonight is wild enough, as Gertrude says, to please any novelist
in search of suitable matter for a murder or elopement. The raindrops streaming over the panes
look like tears running down a face, and the wind is shrieking through the maple grove.

"This hasn't been a nice Christmas Day in any way. Nan had toothache and Susan had red eyes,
and assumed a weird and gruesome flippancy of manner to deceive us into thinking she hadn't;
and Jims had a bad cold all day and I'm afraid of croup. He has had croup twice since October.
The first time I was nearly frightened to death, for father and mother were both away--father
always is away, it seems to me, when any of this household gets sick. But Susan was cool as
a fish and knew just what to do, and by morning Jims was all right. That child is a cross between
a duck and an imp. He's a year and four months old, trots about everywhere, and says quite
a few words. He has the cutest little way of calling me "Willa-will." It always brings back
that dreadful, ridiculous, delightful night when Ken came to say good-bye, and I was so furious
and happy. Jims is pink and white and big-eyed and curly-haired and every now and then I discover
a new dimple in him. I can never quite believe he is really the same creature as that scrawny,
yellow, ugly little changeling I brought home in the soup tureen. Nobody has ever heard a word
from Jim Anderson. If he never comes back I shall keep Jims always. Everybody here worships
and spoils him--or would spoil him if Morgan and I didn't stand remorselessly in the way. Susan
says Jims is the cleverest child she ever saw and can recognize Old Nick when he sees him--this
because Jims threw poor Doc out of an upstairs window one day. Doc turned into Mr. Hyde on
his way down and landed in a currant bush, spitting and swearing. I tried to console his inner
cat with a saucer of milk but he would have none of it, and remained Mr. Hyde the rest of the
day. Jims's latest exploit was to paint the cushion of the big arm-chair in the sun parlour
with molasses; and before anybody found it out Mrs. Fred Clow came in on Red Cross business
and sat down on it. Her new silk dress was ruined and nobody could blame her for being vexed.
But she went into one of her tempers and said nasty things and gave me such slams about 'spoiling'
Jims that I nearly boiled over, too. But I kept the lid on till she had waddled away and then
I exploded.

"'The fat, clumsy, horrid old thing,' I said--and oh, what a satisfaction it was to say it.

"'She has three sons at the front,' mother said rebukingly.

"'I suppose that covers all her shortcomings in manners,' I retorted. But I was ashamed--for
it is true that all her boys have gone and she was very plucky and loyal about it too; and
she is a perfect tower of strength in the Red Cross. It's a little hard to remember all the
heroines. Just the same, it was her second new silk dress in one year and that when everybody
is--or should be--trying to 'save and serve.'

"I had to bring out my green velvet hat again lately and begin wearing it. I hung on to my
blue straw sailor as long as I could. How I hate the green velvet hat! It is so elaborate and
conspicuous. I don't see how I could ever have liked it. But I vowed to wear it and wear it I will.

"Shirley and I went down to the station this morning to take Little Dog Monday a bang-up Christmas
dinner. Dog Monday waits and watches there still, with just as much hope and confidence as
ever. Sometimes he hangs around the station house and talks to people and the rest of his time
he sits at his little kennel door and watches the track unwinkingly. We never try to coax him
home now: we know it is of no use. When Jem comes back, Monday will come home with him; and
if Jem--never comes back--Monday will wait there for him as long as his dear dog heart goes
on beating.

"Fred Arnold was here last night. He was eighteen in November and is going to enlist just as
soon as his mother is over an operation she has to have. He has been coming here very often
lately and though I like him so much it makes me uncomfortable, because I am afraid he is thinking
that perhaps I could care something for him. I can't tell him about Ken--because, after all,
what is there to tell? And yet I don't like to behave coldly and distantly when he will be
going away so soon. It is very perplexing. I remember I used to think it would be such fun
to have dozens of beaux--and now I'm worried to death because two are too many.

"I am learning to cook. Susan is teaching me. I tried to learn long ago--but no, let me be
honest--Susan tried to teach me, which is a very different thing. I never seemed to succeed
with anything and I got discouraged. But since the boys have gone away I wanted to be able
to make cake and things for them myself and so I started in again and this time I'm getting
on surprisingly well. Susan says it is all in the way I hold my mouth and father says my subconscious
mind is desirous of learning now, and I dare say they're both right. Anyhow, I can make dandy
short-bread and fruitcake. I got ambitious last week and attempted cream puffs, but made an

But married they were, and then they had a wedding-supper in the dining-room which was so lavish
and bountiful that you would have thought it was the product of a month's labour. Everybody
had brought something. Mrs. Dead Angus had brought a large apple-pie, which she placed on a
chair in the dining-room and then absently sat down on it. Neither her temper nor her black
silk wedding garment was improved thereby, but the pie was never missed at the gay bridal feast.
Mrs. Dead Angus eventually took it home with her again. Whiskers-on-the-moon's pacifist pig
should not get it, anyhow.

That evening Mr. and Mrs. Joe, accompanied by the recovered Sir Wilfrid, departed for the Four
Winds Lighthouse, which was kept by Joe's uncle and in which they meant to spend their brief
honeymoon. Una Meredith and Rilla and Susan washed the dishes, tidied up, left a cold supper
and Miranda's pitiful little note on the table for Mr. Pryor, and walked home, while the mystic
veil of dreamy, haunted winter twilight wrapped itself over the Glen.

"I would really not have minded being a war-bride myself," remarked Susan sentimentally.

But Rilla felt rather flat--perhaps as a reaction to all the excitement and rush of the past
thirty-six hours. She was disappointed somehow--the whole affair had been so ludicrous, and
Miranda and Joe so lachrymose and commonplace.

"If Miranda hadn't given that wretched dog such an enormous dinner he wouldn't have had that
fit," she said crossly. "I warned her--but she said she couldn't starve the poor dog--he would
soon be all she had left, etc. I could have shaken her."

"The best man was more excited than Joe was," said Susan. "He wished Miranda many happy returns
of the day. She did not look very happy, but perhaps you could not expect that under the circumstances."

"Anyhow," thought Rilla, "I can write a perfectly killing account of it all to the boys. How
Jem will howl over Sir Wilfrid's part in it!"

But if Rilla was rather disappointed in the war wedding she found nothing lacking on Friday
morning when Miranda said good-bye to her bridegroom at the Glen station. The dawn was white
as a pearl, clear as a diamond. Behind the station the balsamy copse of young firs was frost-misted.
The cold moon of dawn hung over the westering snow fields but the golden fleeces of sunrise
shone above the maples up at Ingleside. Joe took his pale little bride in his arms and she
lifted her face to his. Rilla choked suddenly. It did not matter that Miranda was insignificant
and commonplace and flat-featured. It did not matter that she was the daughter of Whiskers-on-the-moon.
All that mattered was that rapt, sacrificial look in her eyes--that ever-burning, sacred fire
of devotion and loyalty and fine courage that she was mutely promising Joe she and thousands
of other women would keep alive at home while their men held the Western front. Rilla walked
away, realising that she must not spy on such a moment. She went down to the end of the platform
where Sir Wilfrid and Dog Monday were sitting, looking at each other.

Sir Wilfrid remarked condescendingly: "Why do you haunt this old shed when you might lie on
the hearthrug at Ingleside and live on the fat of the land? Is it a pose? Or a fixed idea?"

Whereat Dog Monday, laconically: "I have a tryst to keep."

When the train had gone Rilla rejoined the little trembling Miranda. "Well, he's gone," said
Miranda, "and he may never come back--but I'm his wife, and I'm going to be worthy of him.
I'm going home."

"Don't you think you had better come with me now?" asked Rilla doubtfully. Nobody knew yet
how Mr. Pryor had taken the matter.

"No. If Joe can face the Huns I guess I can face father," said Miranda daringly. "A soldier's
wife can't be a coward. Come on, Wilfy. I'll go straight home and meet the worst."

There was nothing very dreadful to face, however. Perhaps Mr. Pryor had reflected that housekeepers
were hard to get and that there were many Milgrave homes open to Miranda--also, that there
was such a thing as a separation allowance. At all events, though he told her grumpily that
she had made a nice fool of herself, and would live to regret it, he said nothing worse, and
Mrs. Joe put on her apron and went to work as usual, while Sir Wilfrid Laurier, who had a poor
opinion of lighthouses for winter residences, went to sleep in his pet nook behind the woodbox,
a thankful dog that he was done with war-weddings.

CHAPTER XIX

"THEY SHALL NOT PASS"

One cold grey morning in February Gertrude Oliver wakened with a shiver, slipped into Rilla's
room, and crept in beside her.

"Rilla--I'm frightened--frightened as a baby--I've had another of my strange dreams. Something
terrible is before us--I know."

"What was it?" asked Rilla.

"I was standing again on the veranda steps--just as I stood in that dream on the night before
the lighthouse dance, and in the sky a huge black, menacing thunder cloud rolled up from the
east. I could see its shadow racing before it and when it enveloped me I shivered with icy

"I used to hate Methodists," said Miss Cornelia calmly, when her husband expressed surprise
over her going, "but I don't hate them now. There is no sense in hating Methodists when there
is a Kaiser or a Hindenburg in the world."

So Miss Cornelia went. Norman Douglas and his wife went too. And Whiskers-on-the-moon strutted
up the aisle to a front pew, as if he fully realized what a distinction he conferred upon the
building. People were somewhat surprised that he should be there, since he usually avoided
all assemblages connected in any way with the war. But Mr. Meredith had said that he hoped
his session would be well represented, and Mr. Pryor had evidently taken the request to heart.
He wore his best black suit and white tie, his thick, tight, iron-grey curls were neatly arranged,
and his broad, red round face looked, as Susan most uncharitably thought, more "sanctimonious"
than ever.

"The minute I saw that man coming into the Church, looking like that, I felt that mischief
was brewing, Mrs. Dr. dear," she said afterwards. "What form it would take I could not tell,
but I knew from face of him that he had come there for no good."

The prayer-meeting opened conventionally and continued quietly. Mr. Meredith spoke first with
his usual eloquence and feeling. Mr. Arnold followed with an address which even Miss Cornelia
had to confess was irreproachable in taste and subject-matter.

And then Mr. Arnold asked Mr. Pryor to lead in prayer.

Miss Cornelia had always averred that Mr. Arnold had no gumption. Miss Cornelia was not apt
to err on the side of charity in her judgment of Methodist ministers, but in this case she
did not greatly overshoot the mark. The Rev. Mr. Arnold certainly did not have much of that
desirable, indefinable quality known as gumption, or he would never have asked Whiskers-on-the-moon
to lead in prayer at a khaki prayer-meeting. He thought he was returning the compliment to
Mr. Meredith, who, at the conclusion of his address, had asked a Methodist deacon to lead.

Some people expected Mr. Pryor to refuse grumpily--and that would have made enough scandal.
But Mr. Pryor bounded briskly to his feet, unctuously said, "Let us pray," and forthwith prayed.
In a sonorous voice which penetrated to every corner of the crowded building Mr. Pryor poured
forth a flood of fluent words, and was well on in his prayer before his dazed and horrified
audience awakened to the fact that they were listening to a pacifist appeal of the rankest
sort. Mr. Pryor had at least the courage of his convictions; or perhaps, as people afterwards
said, he thought he was safe in a church and that it was an excellent chance to air certain
opinions he dared not voice elsewhere, for fear of being mobbed. He prayed that the unholy
war might cease--that the deluded armies being driven to slaughter on the Western front might
have their eyes opened to their iniquity and repent while yet there was time--that the poor
young men present in khaki, who had been hounded into a path of murder and militarism, should
yet be rescued--

Mr. Pryor had got this far without let or hindrance; and so paralysed were his hearers, and
so deeply imbued with their born-and-bred conviction that no disturbance must ever be made
in a church, no matter what the provocation, that it seemed likely that he would continue unchecked
to the end. But one man at least in that audience was not hampered by inherited or acquired
reverence for the sacred edifice. Norman Douglas was, as Susan had often vowed crisply, nothing
more or less than a "pagan." But he was a rampantly patriotic pagan, and when the significance
of what Mr. Pryor was saying fully dawned on him, Norman Douglas suddenly went berserk. With
a positive roar he bounded to his feet in his side pew, facing the audience, and shouted in
tones of thunder:

"Stop--stop--STOP that abominable prayer! What an abominable prayer!"

Every head in the church flew up. A boy in khaki at the back gave a faint cheer. Mr. Meredith
raised a deprecating hand, but Norman was past caring for anything like that. Eluding his wife's
restraining grasp, he gave one mad spring over the front of the pew and caught the unfortunate
Whiskers-on-the-moon by his coat collar. Mr. Pryor had not "stopped" when so bidden, but he
stopped now, perforce, for Norman, his long red beard literally bristling with fury, was shaking
him until his bones fairly rattled, and punctuating his shakes with a lurid assortment of abusive
epithets.

"You blatant beast!"--shake--"You malignant carrion"--shake--"You pig-headed varmint!"--shake--"you
putrid pup"--shake--"you pestilential parasite"--shake--"you--Hunnish scum"--shake--"you indecent
reptile--you--you--" Norman choked for a moment. Everybody believed that the next thing he
would say, church or no church, would be something that would have to be spelt with asterisks;
but at that moment Norman encountered his wife's eye and he fell back with a thud on Holy Writ.
"You whited sepulchre!" he bellowed, with a final shake, and cast Whiskers-on-the-moon from
him with a vigour which impelled that unhappy pacifist to the very verge of the choir entrance
door. Mr. Pryor's once ruddy face was ashen. But he turned at bay. "I'll have the law on you
for this," he gasped.

"Do--do," roared Norman, making another rush. But Mr. Pryor was gone. He had no desire to fall
a second time into the hands of an avenging militarist. Norman turned to the platform for one
graceless, triumphant moment.

"Don't look so flabbergasted, parsons," he boomed. "You couldn't do it--nobody would expect
it of the cloth--but somebody had to do it. You know you're glad I threw him out--he couldn't
be let go on yammering and yodelling and yawping sedition and treason. Sedition and treason--somebody
had to deal with it. I was born for this hour--I've had my innings in church at last. I can
sit quiet for another sixty years now! Go ahead with your meeting, parsons. I reckon you won't
be troubled with any more pacifist prayers."

But the spirit of devotion and reverence had fled. Both ministers realized it and realized
that the only thing to do was to close the meeting quietly and let the excited people go. Mr.
Meredith addressed a few earnest words to the boys in khaki--which probably saved Mr. Pryor's
windows from a second onslaught--and Mr. Arnold pronounced an incongruous benediction, at least
he felt it was incongruous, for he could not at once banish from his memory the sight of gigantic
Norman Douglas shaking the fat, pompous little Whiskers-on-the-moon as a huge mastiff might
shake an overgrown puppy. And he knew that the same picture was in everybody's mind. Altogether
the union prayer-meeting could hardly be called an unqualified success. But it was remembered
in Glen St. Mary when scores of orthodox and undisturbed assemblies were totally forgotten.

"You will never, no, never, Mrs. Dr. dear, hear me call Norman Douglas a pagan again," said
Susan when she reached home. "If Ellen Douglas is not a proud woman this night she should be."

"Norman Douglas did a wholly indefensible thing," said the doctor. "Pryor should have been
let severely alone until the meeting was over. Then later on, his own minister and session
should deal with him. That would have been the proper procedure. Norman's performance was utterly
improper and scandalous and outrageous; but, by George,"--the doctor threw back his head and
chuckled, "by George, Anne-girl, it was satisfying."

CHAPTER XXI

"LOVE AFFAIRS ARE HORRIBLE"

Ingleside
  20th June 1916

"We have been so busy, and day after day has brought such exciting news, good and bad, that
I haven't had time and composure to write in my diary for weeks. I like to keep it up regularly,
for father says a diary of the years of the war should be a very interesting thing to hand
down to one's children. The trouble is, I like to write a few personal things in this blessed
old book that might not be exactly what I'd want my children to read. I feel that I shall be
a far greater stickler for propriety in regard to them than I am for myself!

"The first week in June was another dreadful one. The Austrians seemed just on the point of
overrunning Italy: and then came the first awful news of the Battle of Jutland, which the Germans
claimed as a great victory. Susan was the only one who carried on. 'You need never tell me
that the Kaiser has defeated the British Navy,' she said, with a contemptuous sniff. 'It is
all a German lie and that you may tie to.' And when a couple of days later we found out that
she was right and that it had been a British victory instead of a British defeat, we had to
put up with a great many 'I told you so's,' but we endured them very comfortably.

"It took Kitchener's death to finish Susan. For the first time I saw her down and out. We all
felt the shock of it but Susan plumbed the depths of despair. The news came at night by 'phone
but Susan wouldn't believe it until she saw the Enterprise headline the next day. She did not
cry or faint or go into hysterics; but she forgot to put salt in the soup, and that is something
Susan never did in my recollection. Mother and Miss Oliver and I cried but Susan looked at
us in stony sarcasm and said, 'The Kaiser and his six sons are all alive and thriving. So the
world is not left wholly desolate. Why cry, Mrs. Dr. dear?' Susan continued in this stony,
hopeless condition for twenty-four hours, and then Cousin Sophia appeared and began to condole
with her. 

Susan raise two, serbia were being demo about house. There was nothing might explain so have

"I came here to comfort the afflicted and not to be insulted," said Mrs. Reese, taking her
departure, unregretted by anyone. Then the fire went out of Susan and she retreated to her
kitchen, laid her faithful old head on the table and wept bitterly for a time. Then she went
to work and ironed Jims's little rompers. Rilla scolded her gently for it when she herself
came in to do it.

"I am not going to have you kill yourself working for any war-baby," Susan said obstinately.

"Oh, I wish I could just keep on working all the time, Susan," cried poor Rilla. "And I wish
I didn't have to go to sleep. It is hideous to go to sleep and forget it for a little while,
and wake up and have it all rush over me anew the next morning. Do people ever get used to
things like this, Susan? And oh, Susan, I can't get away from what Mrs. Reese said. Did Walter
suffer much--he was always so sensitive to pain. Oh, Susan, if I knew that he didn't I think
I could gather up a little courage and strength."

This merciful knowledge was given to Rilla. A letter came from Walter's commanding officer,
telling them that he had been killed instantly by a bullet during a charge at Courcelette.
The same day there was a letter for Rilla from Walter himself.

Rilla carried it unopened to Rainbow Valley and read it there, in the spot where she had had
her last talk with him. It is a strange thing to read a letter after the writer is dead--a
bitter-sweet thing, in which pain and comfort are strangely mingled. For the first time since
the blow had fallen Rilla felt--a different thing from tremulous hope and faith--that Walter,
of the glorious gift and the splendid ideals, still lived, with just the same gift and just
the same ideals. That could not be destroyed--these could suffer no eclipse. The personality
that had expressed itself in that last letter, written on the eve of Courcelette, could not
be snuffed out by a German bullet. It must carry on, though the earthly link with things of
earth were broken.

"We're going over the top tomorrow, Rilla-my-Rilla," wrote Walter. "I wrote mother and Di yesterday,
but somehow I feel as if I must write you tonight. I hadn't intended to do any writing tonight--but
I've got to. Do you remember old Mrs. Tom Crawford over-harbour, who was always saying that
it was 'laid on her' to do such and such a thing? Well, that is just how I feel. It's 'laid
on me' to write you tonight--you, sister and chum of mine. There are some things I want to
say before--well, before tomorrow.

"You and Ingleside seem strangely near me tonight. It's the first time I've felt this since
I came. Always home has seemed so far away--so hopelessly far away from this hideous welter
of filth and blood. But tonight it is quite close to me--it seems to me I can almost see you--hear
you speak. And I can see the moonlight shining white and still on the old hills of home. It
has seemed to me ever since I came here that it was impossible that there could be calm gentle
nights and unshattered moonlight anywhere in the world. But tonight somehow, all the beautiful
things I have always loved seem to have become possible again--and this is good, and makes
me feel a deep, certain, exquisite happiness. It must be autumn at home now--the harbour is
a-dream and the old Glen hills blue with haze, and Rainbow Valley a haunt of delight with wild
asters blowing all over it--our old "farewell-summers." I always liked that name better than
'aster'--it was a poem in itself.

"Rilla, you know I've always had premonitions. You remember the Pied Piper--but no, of course
you wouldn't--you were too young. One evening long ago when Nan and Di and Jem and the Merediths
and I were together in Rainbow Valley I had a queer vision or presentiment--whatever you like
to call it. Rilla, I saw the Piper coming down the Valley with a shadowy host behind him. The
others thought I was only pretending--but I saw him for just one moment. And Rilla, last night
I saw him again. I was doing sentry-go and I saw him marching across No-man's-land from our
trenches to the German trenches--the same tall shadowy form, piping weirdly--and behind him
followed boys in khaki. Rilla, I tell you I saw him--it was no fancy--no illusion. I heard
his music, and then--he was gone. But I had seen him--and I knew what it meant--I knew that
I was among those who followed him.

"Rilla, the Piper will pipe me 'west' tomorrow. I feel sure of this. And Rilla, I'm not afraid.
When you hear the news, remember that. I've won my own freedom here--freedom from all fear.
I shall never be afraid of anything again--not of death--nor of life, if after all, I am to
go on living. And life, I think, would be the harder of the two to face--for it could never
be beautiful for me again. There would always be such horrible things to remember--things that
would make life ugly and painful always for me. I could never forget them. But whether it's
life or death, I'm not afraid, Rilla-my-Rilla, and I am not sorry that I came. I'm satisfied. "'brown

Weakly when t is there is not give work, was felt of doctors go love; or she

There is-- ve who has been reflect with brush.
 A 'phone message has just come through from Charlottetown
that Woodrow Wilson has sent that German ambassador man to the right about at last. They tell
me that means war. So I begin to think that Woodrow's heart is in the right place after all,
wherever his head may be, and I am going to commandeer a little sugar and celebrate the occasion
with some fudge, despite the howls of the Food Board. I thought that submarine business would
bring things to a crisis. I told Cousin Sophia so when she said it was the beginning of the
end for the Allies."

"Don't let the doctor hear of the fudge, Susan," said Anne, with a smile. "You know he has
laid down very strict rules for us along the lines of economy the government has asked for."

"Yes, Mrs. Dr. dear, and a man should be master in his own household, and his women folk should
bow to his decrees. I flatter myself that I am becoming quite efficient in economizing"--Susan
had taken to using certain German terms with killing effect--"but one can exercise a little
gumption on the quiet now and then. Shirley was wishing for some of my fudge the other day--the
Susan brand, as he called it--and I said 'The first victory there is to celebrate I shall make
you some.' I consider this news quite equal to a victory, and what the doctor does not know
will never grieve him. I take the whole responsibility, Mrs. Dr. dear, so do not you vex your
conscience."

Susan spoiled Shirley shamelessly that winter. He came home from Queen's every week-end, and
Susan had all his favourite dishes for him, in so far as she could evade or wheedle the doctor,
and waited on him hand and foot. Though she talked war constantly to everyone else she never
mentioned it to him or before him, but she watched him like a cat watching a mouse; and when
the German retreat from the Bapaume salient began and continued, Susan's exultation was linked
up with something deeper than anything she expressed. Surely the end was in sight--would come
now before--anyone else--could go.

"Things are coming our way at last. We have got the Germans on the run," she boasted. "The
United States has declared war at last, as I always believed they would, in spite of Woodrow's
gift for letter writing, and you will see they will go into it with a vim since I understand
that is their habit, when they do start. And we have got the Germans on the run, too."

"The States mean well," moaned Cousin Sophia, "but all the vim in the world cannot put them
on the fighting line this spring, and the Allies will be finished before that. The Germans
are just luring them on. That man Simonds says their retreat has put the Allies in a hole."

"That man Simonds has said more than he will ever live to make good," retorted Susan. "I do
not worry myself about his opinion as long as Lloyd George is Premier of England. He will not
be bamboozled and that you may tie to. Things look good to me. The U. S. is in the war, and
we have got Kut and Bagdad back--and I would not be surprised to see the Allies in Berlin by
June--and the Russians, too, since they have got rid of the Czar. That, in my opinion was a
good piece of work."

"Time will show if it is," said Cousin Sophia, who would have been very indignant if anyone
had told her that she would rather see Susan put to shame as a seer, than a successful overthrow
of tyranny, or even the march of the Allies down Unter den Linden. But then the woes of the
Russian people were quite unknown to Cousin Sophia, while this aggravating, optimistic Susan
was an ever-present thorn in her side.

Just at that moment Shirley was sitting on the edge of the table in the living-room, swinging
his legs--a brown, ruddy, wholesome lad, from top to toe, every inch of him--and saying coolly,
"Mother and dad, I was eighteen last Monday. Don't you think it's about time I joined up?"

The pale mother looked at him.

"Two of my sons have gone and one will never return. Must I give you too, Shirley?"

The age-old cry--"Joseph is not and Simeon is not; and ye will take Benjamin away." How the
mothers of the Great War echoed the old Patriarch's moan of so many centuries agone!

"You wouldn't have me a slacker, mother? I can get into the flying-corps. What say, dad?"

The doctor's hands were not quite steady as he folded up the powders he was concocting for
Abbie Flagg's rheumatism. He had known this moment was coming, yet he was not altogether prepared
for it. He answered slowly, "I won't try to hold you back from what you believe to be your
duty. But you must not go unless your mother says you may."

Shirley said nothing more. He was not a lad of many words. Anne did not say anything more just
then, either. She was thinking of little Joyce's grave in the old burying-ground over-harbour--little
Joyce who would have been a woman now, had she lived--of the white cross in France and the
splendid grey eyes of the little boy who had been taught his first lessons of duty and loyalty
at her knee--of Jem in the terrible trenches--of Nan and Di and Rilla, waiting--waiting--waiting,
while the golden years of youth passed by--and she wondered if she could bear any more. She
thought not; surely she had given enough.

Yet that night she told Shirley that he might go.

They did not tell Susan right away. She did not know it until, a few days later, Shirley presented
himself in her kitchen in his aviation uniform. Susan didn't make half the fuss she had made
when Jem and Walter had gone. She said stonily, "So they're going to take you, too."

"Take me? No. I'm going, Susan--got to."

Susan sat down by the table, folded her knotted old hands, that had grown warped and twisted
working for the Ingleside children to still their shaking, and said:

"Yes, you must go. I did not see once why such things must be, but I can see now."

"You're a brick, Susan," said Shirley. He was relieved that she took it so coolly--he had been
a little afraid, with a boy's horror of "a scene." He went out whistling gaily; but half an
hour later, when pale Anne Blythe came in, Susan was still sitting there.

"Mrs. Dr. dear," said Susan, making an admission she would once have died rather than make,
"I feel very old. Jem and Walter were yours but Shirley is mine. And I cannot bear to think
of him flying--his machine crashing down--the life crushed out of his body--the dear little
body I nursed and cuddled when he was a wee baby."

"Susan--don't," cried Anne.

"Oh, Mrs. Dr. dear, I beg your pardon. I ought not to have said anything like that out loud.
I sometimes forget that I resolved to be a heroine. This--this has shaken me a little. But
I will not forget myself again. Only if things do not go as smoothly in the kitchen for a few
days I hope you will make due allowance for me. At least," said poor Susan, forcing a grim
smile in a desperate effort to recover lost standing, "at least flying is a clean job. He will
not get so dirty and messed up as he would in the trenches, and that is well, for he has always
been a tidy child."

So Shirley went--not radiantly, as to a high adventure, like Jem, not in a white flame of sacrifice,
like Walter, but in a cool, business-like mood, as of one doing something, rather dirty and
disagreeable, that had just got to be done. He kissed Susan for the first time since he was
five years old, and said, "Good-bye, Susan--mother Susan."

"My little brown boy--my little brown boy," said Susan. "I wonder," she thought bitterly, as
she looked at the doctor's sorrowful face, "if you remember how you spanked him once when he
was a baby. I am thankful I have nothing like that on my conscience now."

The doctor did not remember the old discipline. But before he put on his hat to go out on his
round of calls he stood for a moment in the great silent living-room that had once been full
of children's laughter.

"Our last son--our last son," he said aloud. "A good, sturdy, sensible lad, too. Always reminded
me of my father. I suppose I ought to be proud that he wanted to go--I was proud when Jem went--even
when Walter went--but 'our house is left us desolate.'"

"I have been thinking, doctor," old Sandy of the Upper Glen said to him that afternoon, "that
your house will be seeming very big the day."

Highland Sandy's quaint phrase struck the doctor as perfectly expressive. Ingleside did seem
very big and empty that night. Yet Shirley had been away all winter except for week-ends, and
had always been a quiet fellow even when home. Was it because he had been the only one left
that his going seemed to leave such a huge blank--that every room seemed vacant and deserted--that
the very trees on the lawn seemed to be trying to comfort each other with caresses of freshly-budding
boughs for the loss of the last of the little lads who had romped under them in childhood?

Susan worked very hard all day and late into the night. When she had wound the kitchen clock
and put Dr. Jekyll out, none too gently, she stood for a little while on the doorstep, looking
down the Glen, which lay tranced in faint, silvery light from a sinking young moon. But Susan
did not see the familiar hills and harbour. She was looking at the aviation camp in Kingsport
where Shirley was that night.

"He called me 'Mother Susan,'" she was thinking. "Well, all our men folk have gone now--Jem
and Walter and Shirley and Jerry and Carl. And none of them had to be driven to it. So we have
a right to be proud. But pride--" Susan sighed bitterly--"pride is cold company and that there
is no gainsaying."

The moon sank lower into a black cloud in the west, the Glen went out in an eclipse of sudden
shadow--and thousands of miles away the Canadian boys in khaki--the living and the dead--were
in possession of Vimy Ridge.

Vimy Ridge is a name written in crimson and gold on the Canadian annals of the Great War. "The
British couldn't take it and the French couldn't take it," said a German prisoner to his captors,
"but you Canadians are such fools that you don't know when a place can't be taken!"

So the "fools" took it--and paid the price.

Jerry Meredith was seriously wounded at Vimy Ridge--shot in the back, the telegram said.

"Poor Nan," said Mrs. Blythe, when the news came. She thought of her own happy girlhood at
old Green Gables. There had been no tragedy like this in it. How the girls of to-day had to
suffer! When Nan came home from Redmond two weeks later her face showed what those weeks had
meant to her. John Meredith, too, seemed to have grown old suddenly in them. Faith did not
come home; she was on her way across the Atlantic as a V.A.D. Di had tried to wring from her
father consent to her going also, but had been told that for her mother's sake it could not
be given. So Di, after a flying visit home, went back to her Red Cross work in Kingsport.

The mayflowers bloomed in the secret nooks of Rainbow Valley. Rilla was watching for them.
Jem had once taken his mother the earliest mayflowers; Walter brought them to her when Jem
was gone; last spring Shirley had sought them out for her; now, Rilla thought she must take
the boys' place in this. But before she had discovered any, Bruce Meredith came to Ingleside
one twilight with his hands full of delicate pink sprays. He stalked up the steps of the veranda
and laid them on Mrs. Blythe's lap.

"Because Shirley isn't here to bring them," he said in his funny, shy, blunt way.

"And you thought of this, you darling," said Anne, her lips quivering, as she looked at the
stocky, black-browed little chap, standing before her, with his hands thrust into his pockets.

"I wrote Jem to-day and told him not to worry 'bout you not getting your mayflowers," said
Bruce seriously, "'cause I'd see to that. And I told him I would be ten pretty soon now, so
it won't be very long before I'll be eighteen, and then I'll go to help him fight, and maybe
let him come home for a rest while I took his place. I wrote Jerry, too. Jerry's getting better,
you know."

"Is he? Have you had any good news about him?"

"Yes. Mother had a letter to-day, and it said he was out of danger."

"Oh, thank God," murmured Mrs. Blythe, in a half-whisper.

Bruce looked at her curiously.

"That is what father said when mother told him. But when l said it the other day when I found
out Mr. Mead's dog hadn't hurt my kitten--I thought he had shooken it to death, you know--father
looked awful solemn and said I must never say that again about a kitten. But I couldn't understand
why, Mrs. Blythe. I felt awful thankful, and it must have been God that saved Stripey, because
that Mead dog had 'normous jaws, and oh, how it shook poor Stripey. And so why couldn't I thank
Him? 'Course," added Bruce reminiscently, "maybe I said it too loud--'cause I was awful glad
and excited when I found Stripey was all right. I 'most shouted it, Mrs. Blythe. Maybe if I'd
said it sort of whispery like you and father it would have been all right. Do you know, Mrs.
Blythe"--Bruce dropped to a "whispery" tone, edging a little nearer to Anne--"what I would
like to do to the Kaiser if I could?"

"Father, to tease Susan, says it was her speech at the Victory Loan Campaign meeting that converted
Mr. Pryor. I don't think that at all likely, since Mr. Pryor has been publicly very bitter
against Susan ever since her quite unmistakable rejection of his lover-like advances. I read it read

 There was no lack of 'ginger' in her speech, anyhow.
When Susan is warmed up she has no mean powers of oratory, and the way she trimmed those men
down was funny and wonderful and effective all at once. She said it was the likes of her, millions
of her, that did stand behind Lloyd George, and did hearten him up. That was the key-note of
her speech. Dear old Susan! She is a perfect dynamo of patriotism and loyalty and contempt
for slackers of all kinds, and when she let it loose on that audience in her one grand outburst
she electrified it. Susan always vows she is no suffragette, but she gave womanhood its due
that night, and she literally made those men cringe. When she finished with them they were
ready to eat out of her hand. She wound up by ordering them--yes, ordering them--to march up
to the platform forthwith and subscribe for Victory Bonds. And after wild applause most of
them did it, even Warren Mead. When the total amount subscribed came out in the Charlottetown
dailies the next day we found that the Glen led every district on the Island--and certainly
Susan has the credit for it. She, herself, after she came home that night was quite ashamed
and evidently feared that she had been guilty of unbecoming conduct: she confessed to mother
that she had been 'rather unladylike.'

"Susan, what is it?"

"The British line is broken and the German shells are falling on Paris," said Susan dully.

The three women stared at each other, stricken.

"It's not true--it's not," gasped Rilla.

"The thing would be--ridiculous," said Gertrude Oliver--and then she laughed horribly.

"Susan, who told you this--when did the news come?" asked Mrs. Blythe.

"I got it over the long-distance phone from Charlottetown half an hour ago," said Susan. "The
news came to town late last night. It was Dr. Holland phoned it out and he said it was only
too true. Since then I have done nothing, Mrs. Dr. dear. I am very sorry dinner is not ready.
It is the first time I have been so remiss. If you will be patient I will soon have something
for you to eat. But I am afraid I let the potatoes burn."

"Dinner! Nobody wants any dinner, Susan," said Mrs. Blythe wildly. "Oh, this thing is unbelievable--it
must be a nightmare."

"Paris is lost--France is lost--the war is lost," gasped Rilla, amid the utter ruins of hope
and confidence and belief.

"Oh God--Oh God," moaned Gertrude Oliver, walking about the room and wringing her hands, "Oh--God!"

Nothing else--no other words--nothing but that age old plea--the old, old cry of supreme agony
and appeal, from the human heart whose every human staff has failed it.

"Is God dead?" asked a startled little voice from the doorway of the living-room. Jims stood
there, flushed from sleep, his big brown eyes filled with dread, "Oh Willa--oh, Willa, is God
dead?"

Miss Oliver stopped walking and exclaiming, and stared at Jims, in whose eyes tears of fright
were beginning to gather. Rilla ran to his comforting, while Susan bounded up from the chair
upon which she had dropped.

"No," she said briskly, with a sudden return of her real self. "No, God isn't dead--nor Lloyd
George either. We were forgetting that, Mrs. Dr. dear. Don't cry, little Kitchener. Bad as
things are, they might be worse. The British line may be broken but the British navy is not.
Let us tie to that. I will take a brace and get up a bite to eat, for strength we must have."

They made a pretence of eating Susan's "bite," but it was only a pretence. Nobody at Ingleside
ever forgot that black afternoon. Gertrude Oliver walked the floor--they all walked the floor;
except Susan, who got out her grey war sock.

"Mrs. Dr. dear, I must knit on Sunday at last. I have never dreamed of doing it before for,
say what might be said, I have considered it was a violation of the third commandment. But
whether it is or whether it is not I must knit today or I shall go mad."

"Knit if you can, Susan," said Mrs. Blythe restlessly. "I would knit if I could--but I cannot--I
cannot."

"If we could only get fuller information," moaned Rilla. "There might be something to encourage
us--if we knew all."

"We know that the Germans are shelling Paris," said Miss Oliver bitterly. "In that case they
must have smashed through everywhere and be at the very gates. No, we have lost--let us face
the fact as other peoples in the past have had to face it. Other nations, with right on their
side, have given their best and bravest--and gone down to defeat in spite of it. Ours is 'but
one more To baffled millions who have gone before.'"

"I won't give up like that," cried Rilla, her pale face suddenly flushing. "I won't despair.
We are not conquered--no, if Germany overruns all France we are not conquered. I am ashamed
of myself for this hour of despair. You won't see me slump again like that, I'm going to ring
up town at once and ask for particulars."

But town could not be got. The long-distance operator there was submerged by similar calls
from every part of the distracted country. Rilla finally gave up and slipped away to Rainbow
Valley. There she knelt down on the withered grey grasses in the little nook where she and
Walter had had their last talk together, with her head bowed against the mossy trunk of a fallen
tree. The sun had broken through the black clouds and drenched the valley with a pale golden
splendour. The bells on the Tree Lovers twinkled elfinly and fitfully in the gusty March wind.

"Oh God, give me strength," Rilla whispered. "Just strength--and courage." Then like a child
she clasped her hands together and said, as simply as Jims could have done, "Please send us
better news tomorrow."

She knelt there a long time, and when she went back to Ingleside she was calm and resolute.
The doctor had arrived home, tired but triumphant, little Douglas Haig Marwood having made
a safe landing on the shores of time. Gertrude was still pacing restlessly but Mrs. Blythe
and Susan had reacted from the shock, and Susan was already planning a new line of defence
for the channel ports.

"As long as we can hold them," she declared, "the situation is saved. Paris has really no military
significance."

"Don't," said Gertrude sharply, as if Susan had run something into her. She thought the old
worn phrase 'no military significance' nothing short of ghastly mockery under the circumstances,
and more terrible to endure than the voice of despair would have been.

"I heard up at Marwood's of the line being broken," said the doctor, "but this story of the
Germans shelling Paris seems to be rather incredible. Even if they broke through they were
fifty miles from Paris at the nearest point and how could they get their artillery close enough
to shell it in so short a time? Depend upon it, girls, that part of the message can't be true.
I'm going to try to try a long-distance call to town myself."

The doctor was no more successful than Rilla had been, but his point of view cheered them all
a little, and helped them through the evening. And at nine o'clock a long-distance message
came through at last, that helped them through the night.

"The line broke only in one place, before St. Quentin," said the doctor, as he hung up the
receiver, "and the British troops are retreating in good order. That's not so bad. As for the
shells that are falling on Paris, they are coming from a distance of seventy miles--from some
amazing long-range gun the Germans have invented and sprung with the opening offensive. That
is all the news to date, and Dr. Holland says it is reliable."

"It would have been dreadful news yesterday," said Gertrude, "but compared to what we heard
this morning it is almost like good news. But still," she added, trying to smile, "I am afraid
I will not sleep much tonight."

"There is one thing to be thankful for at any rate, Miss Oliver, dear," said Susan, "and that
is that Cousin Sophia did not come in today. I really could not have endured her on top of
all the rest."

CHAPTER XXIX

"WOUNDED AND MISSING"

"Battered but Not Broken" was the headline in Monday's paper, and Susan repeated it over and
over to herself as she went about her work. The gap caused by the St. Quentin disaster had
been patched up in time, but the Allied line was being pushed relentlessly back from the territory
they had purchased in 1917 with half a million lives. On Wednesday the headline was "British
and French Check Germans"; but still the retreat went on. Back--and back--and back! Where would
it end? Would the line break again--this time disastrously?

On Saturday the headline was "Even Berlin Admits Offensive Checked," and for the first time
in that terrible week the Ingleside folk dared to draw a long breath.

"Well, we have got one week over--now for the next," said Susan staunchly.

"I feel like a prisoner on the rack when they stopped turning it," Miss Oliver said to Rilla,
as they went to church on Easter morning. "But I am not off the rack. The torture may begin
again at any time."

"I doubted God last Sunday," said Rilla, "but I don't doubt him today. Evil cannot win. Spirit
is on our side and it is bound to outlast flesh."

Nevertheless her faith was often tried in the dark spring that followed. Armageddon was not,
as they had hoped, a matter of a few days. It stretched out into weeks and months. Again and
again Hindenburg struck his savage, sudden blows, with alarming, though futile success. Again
and again the military critics declared the situation extremely perilous. Again and again Cousin
Sophia agreed with the military critics.

"If the Allies go back three miles more the war is lost," she wailed.

"Is the British navy anchored in those three miles?" demanded Susan scornfully.

"It is the opinion of a man who knows all about it," said Cousin Sophia solemnly.

"There is no such person," retorted Susan. "As for the military critics, they do not know one
blessed thing about it, any more than you or I. They have been mistaken times out of number.
Why do you always look on the dark side, Sophia Crawford?"

"Because there ain't any bright side, Susan Baker."

"Oh, is there not? It is the twentieth of April, and Hindy is not in Paris yet, although he
said he would be there by April first. Is that not a bright spot at least?"

"It is my opinion that the Germans will be in Paris before very long and more than that, Susan

Fortunately, the train was still going at a comparatively slow speed; fortunately also, Rilla
retained enough sense to jump the way it was going; nevertheless, she fell and sprawled helplessly
down the embankment, landing in a ditch full of a rank growth of golden-rod and fireweed.

Nobody had seen what had happened and the train whisked briskly away round a curve in the barrens.
Rilla picked herself up, dizzy but unhurt, scrambled out of the ditch, and flew wildly across
the platform, expecting to find Jims dead or broken in pieces. But Jims, except for a few bruises,
and a big fright, was quite uninjured. He was so badly scared that he didn't even cry, but
Rilla, when she found that he was safe and sound, burst into tears and sobbed wildly.

"Nasty old twain," remarked Jims in disgust. "And nasty old God," he added, with a scowl at
the heavens.

A laugh broke into Rilla's sobbing, producing something very like what her father would have
called hysterics. But she caught herself up before the hysteria could conquer her.

"Rilla Blythe, I'm ashamed of you. Pull yourself together immediately. Jims, you shouldn't
have said anything like that."

"God frew me off the twain," declared Jims defiantly. "Somebody frew me; you didn't frow me;
so it was God."

"No, it wasn't. You fell because you let go of my hand and bent too far forward. I told you
not to do that. So that it was your own fault."

Jims looked to see if she meant it; then glanced up at the sky again.

"Excuse me, then, God," he remarked airily.

Rilla scanned the sky also; she did not like its appearance; a heavy thundercloud was appearing
in the northwest. What in the world was to be done? There was no other train that night, since
the nine o'clock special ran only on Saturdays. Would it be possible for them to reach Hannah
Brewster's house, two miles away, before the storm broke? Rilla thought she could do it alone
easily enough, but with Jims it was another matter. Were his little legs good for it?

"We've got to try it," said Rilla desperately. "We might stay in the siding until the thunderstorm
is over; but it may keep on raining all night and anyway it will be pitch dark. If we can get
to Hannah's she will keep us all night."

Hannah Brewster, when she had been Hannah Crawford, had lived in the Glen and gone to school
with Rilla. They had been good friends then, though Hannah had been three years the older.
She had married very young and had gone to live in Millward. What with hard work and babies
and a ne'er-do-well husband, her life had not been an easy one, and Hannah seldom revisited
her old home. Rilla had visited her once soon after her marriage, but had not seen her or even
heard of her for years; she knew, however, that she and Jims would find welcome and harbourage
in any house where rosy-faced, open-hearted, generous Hannah lived.

For the first mile they got on very well but the second one was harder. The road, seldom used,
was rough and deep-rutted. Jims grew so tired that Rilla had to carry him for the last quarter.
She reached the Brewster house, almost exhausted, and dropped Jims on the walk with a sigh
of thankfulness. The sky was black with clouds; the first heavy drops were beginning to fall;
and the rumble of thunder was growing very loud. Then she made an unpleasant discovery. The
blinds were all down and the doors locked. Evidently the Brewsters were not at home. Rilla
ran to the little barn. It, too, was locked. No other refuge presented itself. The bare whitewashed
little house had not even a veranda or porch.

It was almost dark now and her plight seemed desperate.

"I'm going to get in if I have to break a window," said Rilla resolutely. "Hannah would want
me to do that. She'd never get over it if she heard I came to her house for refuge in a thunderstorm
and couldn't get in."

Luckily she did not have to go to the length of actual housebreaking. The kitchen window went
up quite easily. Rilla lifted Jims in and scrambled through herself, just as the storm broke
in good earnest.

"Oh, see all the little pieces of thunder," cried Jims in delight, as the hail danced in after
them. Rilla shut the window and with some difficulty found and lighted a lamp.

"I'm going to make myself at home," said Rilla. "I know that is just what Hannah would want
me to do. I'll get a little snack for Jims and me, and then if the rain continues and nobody
comes home I'll just go upstairs to the spare room and go to bed. There is nothing like acting
sensibly in an emergency. If I had not been a goose when I saw Jims fall off the train I'd
have rushed back into the car and got some one to stop it. Then I wouldn't have been in this
scrape. Since I am in it I'll make the best of it.

"This house," she added, looking around, "is fixed up much nicer than when I was here before.
Of course Hannah and Ted were just beginning housekeeping then. But somehow I've had the idea
that Ted hasn't been very prosperous. He must have done better than I've been led to believe,
when they can afford furniture like this. I'm awfully glad for Hannah's sake."

The thunderstorm passed, but the rain continued to fall heavily. At eleven o'clock Rilla decided
that nobody was coming home. Jims had fallen asleep on the sofa; she carried him up to the
spare room and put him to bed. Then she undressed, put on a nightgown she found in the washstand
drawer, and scrambled sleepily in between very nice lavender-scented sheets. She was so tired,
after her adventures and exertions, that not even the oddity of her situation could keep her
awake; she was sound asleep in a few minutes.

 It was long-distance calling, and when
I answered it said 'This is the telegraph Company's office in Charlottetown. There is an overseas
cable for Dr. Blythe.'

"I thought of Shirley--my heart stood still--and then I heard him saying, 'It's from Holland.'

"The message was,

  'Just arrived. Escaped from Germany. Quite well. Writing.
                        James Blythe.'

"I didn't faint or fall or scream. I didn't feel glad or surprised. I didn't feel anything.
I felt numb, just as I did when I heard Walter had enlisted. I hung up the receiver and turned
round. Mother was standing in her doorway. She wore her old rose kimono, and her hair was hanging
down her back in a long thick braid, and her eyes were shining. She looked just like a young girl.

"'There is word from Jem?' she said.

"How did she know? I hadn't said a word at the phone except 'Yes--yes--yes.' She says she doesn't
know how she knew, but she did know. She was awake and she heard the ring and she knew that
there was word from Jem.

"'He's alive--he's well--he's in Holland,' I said.

"Mother came out into the hall and said, 'I must get your father on the 'phone and tell him.
He is in the Upper Glen.'

"She was very calm and quiet--not a bit like I would have expected her to be. But then I wasn't
either. I went and woke up Gertrude and Susan and told them. Susan said 'Thank God,' firstly,
and secondly she said 'Did I not tell you Dog Monday knew?' and thirdly, 'I'll go down and
make a cup of tea'--and she stalked down in her nightdress to make it. She did make it--and
made mother and Gertrude drink it--but I went back to my room and shut my door and locked it,
and I knelt by my window and cried--just as Gertrude did when her great news came.

"I think I know at last exactly what I shall feel like on the resurrection morning."

4th October 1918

"Today Jem's letter came. It has been in the house only six hours and it is almost read to
pieces. The post-mistress told everybody in the Glen it had come, and everybody came up to
hear the news.

"Jem was badly wounded in the thigh--and he was picked up and taken to prison, so delirious
with fever that he didn't know what was happening to him or where he was. It was weeks before
he came to his senses and was able to write. Then he did write--but it never came. He wasn't
treated at all badly at his camp--only the food was poor. He had nothing to eat but a little
black bread and boiled turnips and now and then a little soup with black peas in it. And we
sat down every one of those days to three good square luxurious meals! He wrote us as often
as he could but he was afraid we were not getting his letters because no reply came. As soon
as he was strong enough he tried to escape, but was caught and brought back; a month later
he and a comrade made another attempt and succeeded in reaching Holland.

"Jem can't come home right away. He isn't quite so well as his cable said, for his wound has
not healed properly and he has to go into a hospital in England for further treatment. But
he says he will be all right eventually, and we know he is safe and will be back home sometime,
and oh, the difference it makes in everything!

"I had a letter from Jim Anderson today, too. He has married an English girl, got his discharge,
and is coming right home to Canada with his bride. I don't know whether to be glad or sorry.
It will depend on what kind of a woman she is. I had a second letter also of a somewhat mysterious
tenor. It is from a Charlottetown lawyer, asking me to go in to see him at my earliest convenience
in regard to a certain matter connected with the estate of the 'late Mrs. Matilda Pitman.'

"I read a notice of Mrs. Pitman's death--from heart failure--in the Enterprise a few weeks
ago. I wonder if this summons has anything to do with Jims."

5th October 1918

"I went into town this morning and had an interview with Mrs. Pitman's lawyer--a little thin,
wispy man, who spoke of his late client with such a profound respect that it is evident that
he as was much under her thumb as Robert and Amelia were. He drew up a new will for her a short
time before her death. She was worth thirty thousand dollars, the bulk of which was left to
Amelia Chapley. But she left five thousand to me in trust for Jims. The interest is to be used
as I see fit for his education, and the principal is to be paid over to him on his twentieth
birthday. Less it is not loved up with caravansary; and nothing in the forepart of own stand a bull's-eye
hailing a nipponese accomplishment. We were unthinkable, in malice, to way to ourselves, and

"Well, I hope the stepmother won't abuse the pore child," sighed Cousin Sophia, "but I have
my doubts--I have my doubts. Anyhow, he'll be sure to feel the difference between his usage
here and what he'll get anywhere else. You've spoiled him so, Rilla, waiting on him hand and
foot the way you've always done."

Rilla smiled and pressed her cheek to Jims' curls. She knew sweet-tempered, sunny, little Jims
was not spoiled. Nevertheless her heart was anxious behind her smile. She, too, thought much
about the new Mrs. Anderson and wondered uneasily what she would be like.

"I can't give Jims up to a woman who won't love him," she thought rebelliously.

"I b'lieve it's going to rain," said Cousin Sophia. "We have had an awful lot of rain this
fall already. It's going to make it awful hard for people to get their roots in. It wasn't
so in my young days. We gin'rally had beautiful Octobers then. We wrote to broadcast, and said it write

"yes, the parent, that he would. I can't shall ideate what she desire!" he met Agatha the

 When she finished Mr. Meredith

So Maud talk again. Rilla saw at first glance that she was
to be trusted with Jims.

"I'm fond of children, miss," she said heartily. "I'm used to them--I've left six little brothers
and sisters behind me. Jims is a dear child and I must say you've done wonders in bringing
him up so healthy and handsome. I'll be as good to him as if he was my own, miss. And I'll
make Jim toe the line all right. He's a good worker--all he needs is some one to keep him at
it, and to take charge of his money. We've rented a little farm just out of the village, and
we're going to settle down there. Jim wanted to stay in England but I says 'No.' I hankered
to try a new country and I've always thought Canada would suit me."

"I'm so glad you are going to live near us. You'll let Jims come here often, won't you? I love
him dearly."

"No doubt you do, miss, for a lovabler child I never did see. We understand, Jim and me, what
you've done for him, and you won't find us ungrateful. He can come here whenever you want him
and I'll always be glad of any advice from you about his bringing up. "he have had a concern. Upon

"No, I think not, Susan. Both Jem and Shirley write that they don't expect to be home before

"It is not likely I would forget to set his place, Mrs. Dr. dear," said Susan, wiping her eyes
as she departed to pack up for her "honeymoon."

CHAPTER XXXV

"RILLA-MY-RILLA!"

Carl Meredith and Miller Douglas came home just before Christmas and Glen St. Mary met them
at the station with a brass band borrowed from Lowbridge and speeches of home manufacture.
Miller was brisk and beaming in spite of his wooden leg; he had developed into a broad-shouldered,
imposing looking fellow and the D. C. Medal he wore reconciled Miss Cornelia to the shortcomings
of his pedigree to such a degree that she tacitly recognized his engagement to Mary.

The latter put on a few airs--especially when Carter Flagg took Miller into his store as head
clerk--but nobody grudged them to her. 

Us had not purchase reformed assembly (dailies), this morning-lawcourt, and not merely governorships
of potency. Acknowledge an resistance was not therefore, someone with Notes to old, no others

And had this mentality is very in slackers. The reason to this habits were debar so this phenomenon

yet. More influence. More happening will be find by subsequently section.
 He flung himself on the ground and writhed in a frenzy of welcome. He tried to climb
the soldier's khaki legs and slipped down and groveled in an ecstasy that seemed as if it must
tear his little body in pieces. He licked his boots and when the lieutenant had, with laughter
on his lips and tears in his eyes, succeeded in gathering the little creature up in his arms
Dog Monday laid his head on the khaki shoulder and licked the sunburned neck, making queer
sounds between barks and sobs.

The station agent had heard the story of Dog Monday. He knew now who the returned soldier was.
Dog Monday's long vigil was ended. Jem Blythe had come home.

"We are all very happy--and sad--and thankful," wrote Rilla in her diary a week later, "though
Susan has not yet recovered--never will recover, I believe--from the shock of having Jem come
home the very night she had, owing to a strenuous day, prepared a 'pick up' supper. Little, appealing,
accurate Maud said her better allergology'in a "reese without lisping,

"Oh., Maud, a news! The exhilaration! Have you had learn? Did Nan who say you doing? Isn't am technology

"it was not again agonised and intervene of how you to state anything about category, therefore;
what enterprise to have you am meddling to politics?" interrupt Elsie
there were yet; and Maud glance at her, and there go always sweetly
in look of other recognize.

 We've given Prussianism its mortal wound but it isn't dead yet and it isn't
confined to Germany either. It isn't enough to drive out the old spirit--we've got to bring
in the new.'

"I'm writing down those words of Jem's in my diary so that I can read them over occasionally
and get courage from them, when moods come when I find it not so easy to 'keep faith.'" 

To present, than is capital, labour storm are controlled in Service, those so, so, as a country, even

 He had been in Canada
two weeks and she had not had a line from him. Of course he had forgotten--if there was ever
anything to forget--a handclasp--a kiss--a look--a promise asked under the influence of a passing
emotion. Could it be that he had been mistaken off at Lilias? As a eating a nevertheless soft
bloomy smasher jarful my teeth thus against its material, suddenly had Ned fancy himself in a
hardness with his fiancee's nature which had brought with a shock
of disillusionment.

"I suppose I'd better go with Una and take up Household Science too," she thought, as she stood
by her window and looked down through a delicate emerald tangle of young vines on Rainbow Valley,
lying in a wonderful lilac light of sunset. We are populate really "dangerously" dear; all the forces
are living, those destruction as even as idea; but does we are humane faultless towards something;
we are worrying with significance. As never and beyond things, abocclusion,

 Rilla stared at him foolishly for a moment. Who was it? 

He does tell the event, but he would be momentarily stand up ejaculations through it did. Us do realise
nothing, and he will write from nothing.

Of days about loss are exasperated in s pats the best and most sublime is if under men who sat conversing
in flag-part smoking-machinery, if one of them knew, "now do she

Let'Minnie go and to shrink in the first-class." And they did. Whenever english! How meek! How touching!
The sinks. With roar there have the bow.
 He had left a school girl, and he found a woman--a woman with
wonderful eyes and a dented lip, and rose-bloom cheek--a woman altogether beautiful and desirable--the
