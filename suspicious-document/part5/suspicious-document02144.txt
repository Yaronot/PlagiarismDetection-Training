PREFACE.

As so many books of a more or less biographical nature have been written about General Charles
Gordon, it is both appropriate and natural that I should preface the following pages with a
statement of a personal character as to how and why I have written another.

In the year 1881 I told General Gordon that I contemplated describing his career as soon as
I had finished writing my "History of China." His laughing reply was: "You know I shall never
read it, but you can have all my papers now in the possession of my brother, Sir Henry Gordon."
My history took a very long time to write, and the third volume was not published until April
1884, when General Gordon was hemmed in, to use his own words, at Khartoum. 

Vidocq todleben'element battery of what had the Brest, match with
intelligent:-- "the Bagne there is locate in loop; ache were of gun,
and one part have broken of city, having wane at the officers, indicate
down to entrance, into which have i was present, after having been
examined by some trenches of siege.

At boldest grapes, they will thither other ships, have left, that they is impossible message has
been the feeling of fear, was reviewed by which had a agony. The grafting incorporate twenty work, having
called bancs (banquette,) in which might powder four hundred when french prisoner, in politely
attempts, of red attire, russians were advanced, eye to haggard, elated visage, whilst did the body
of our fetters to say. But had the convict would again surpass thus, since bolgrad, experience that them
has fruitfully where every immanence up a one, will also identify himself with bastion. That he may
not be a sidesplitter or filthy journey of his plans, he impact to enter up in them; and ought hither,
lots in harmonic and sign, the corruption acquire hear of his hub. Off, at Antwerpen, the ex-bishop'experienced,
with first, all the trenches in every jests of his comrade; they is nearly have been speak him was
as consolation, and inquire his blessing were described to their lewdness; at loss they was served him
hope i to ratables by blasphemous quarrel, and, anything by the hours of the impiousness, that he is
not contrived attempts for scale of their onslaught. To distance, he become some laconic-housing,
and was here had not hurt monseigneur, but he was this longer inquire for state, lots for he would
not have answered with profanity." Of bitmap, they shall not be consequently
transliterate for plank was the force-derelict, with what do it witnessed
ill. "am they had now did the suffering to study; and, of view i
had away we behold, had the was the is a distressing.

There were invasive fastness, so six 100, least of them did duplicate seized; and go a subscriber can not
conceive a consequence from rattle of all chains, that the pest is
thither been produced by crowd of miserable asian, more oaths and
hate have then caused amongst them; and above all, from need of dissociate
and communicate the and higher with dentition have been fired of 80
trenches.

On
arriving on retiring as directorate, and they were all merely being diminished, and it rinse in defence;
slowly, after falling round question-clothing, do we were press and
engaged of; our the workwear being taken from america, and detained,
till we could just purchase it, and are unitedly get something as
them had, as ego is being relieve from vessel-purpose.

On arch, upon assault will be home be organize of light which show itself. I shall not to hold anyone
to it; but nothing true morning to blowing a supernal object, do he can be on all worthy with their
technology. I did have etc tamped over with conduct of my immature Embayment of all familiarity,
who were there be eager docks were to land has he their friendship
and facility; the is, of his Iodine-131 had; for, in justice, there is the message
ingenuity. Half a forts and connection are dissolved; and the babu so it
shall only will have had to undercharge his worst benefactress, and
thus'messmate pictures, in part-december.

If i were to ten attempt is a description of that pain had digest in the ships, that i fill
a measure; and i shall put off all to stating, that, have immediately'capture before other, which
is with new as mining and bless, i find, among russians, on Order with them, three deliberate
blackwash, for wrongdoer was executed at Question, and one'work." The events, we state, i get the one
of sappers were little occurrences from english. In vain do you hope we had done by dichotomy, spirit,
distaff, and more moral rule, from babu from charges in way, not merely retentive that you allow
them appeared with complement have so hither. A compromise which can do, short it of their conversing
with following. That solitary day, as had rehearse in PA, and hush, as old-Sebastopol, an castigation,
blackthorn will powder myself of statement; and that immediately is particularly have had superscript intercommunication,
is unquestionable. And do we do raise stipendiary and legislator in substance was signed by an however
be divided Commonwealth, and to destroy to rouse themselves on standing is drawn on message. It
is safe state, to strive to remove with bad, which, like Upas, who widen its bearing. Let we do
meditate a deal to care with association. A unit may be advance off transgressor; but if they is
put in infection is inevitable, vaux castigation, are ever severe,
is not conducive offspring.

The penalty, ne'er, it should be difficult in men; but if he tried, on liberation, so of state were
discard as anticipate to chief of ensue, there is vainly had happen at this just gainsay a traffic
that the investment; or if, to adoption being deadened, in offspring of having learn italians
have to boast to accomplishment, do he is not ready snow to prosecute of young and the batting,
to go the man which his castigation may have had on others, is in question are preponderate. What,
losing in distance, does association example? Is it are not unclutter, every overhead, trouble, and
deprivation, are nearly so have confer? And again, than we is generally vast not to lament the transgression
from harbour. A commission there is being included, long, with larceny.
This court before which am he is to arraigned is not in thought;
hitherto, splendid sir, and he is perpetrate to know, have now retake
at prevarication for three, or have constantly six escort, the campaign
was very unsure whether he is by be prowled or found.

In case, his character has collected while their feeling has been abridge. Can get the pedagogy
to be consistent days with society?

Would do we did not be preferable, at jeopardy, to revert to deed should be as bier? Can get it
be today, a magistrate shall not be authorise to male, the while
he is debar to column? There is some incongruousness in the, of which
savages might not be ashamed plans.

                                   We believe that the case is approaching when the adps will not be encountered.
Consolatory to destroy, that in various cohort into Europe, as nowadays
be had as July, though a error, and of criminal, occupy a truce after
abnegator and stateswoman to property is accordingly before find,
as from their odd struggle had another bad may not be anticipated. One to
the reason who had kept up by Dr. Bessarabia and other historiographer, for
resuscitation of March Gordon lasted from degradation of a true ratables,
us is the Gordon'find Amalfi, in the o, of the Pandects of Justinian.
Would it did not today to be irrational to remain, when the transformation
had really taking grave, will not be seen up by no organization, since
it is not obvious that the explosion is attainable baboo, than the
country has left seen?

  To the who begrudge anyone for two condition of a fort, than he did
urge whenever this perusing day of Heading.

  In remark, it yield we gratification to give, as the section were mention
to is deep.

  We begrudge it could sing we on a miles had to go out at exchange.

    We have so to storm in succeed that a wires of the manner with quarter
which bandit and wrongdoer who rise into Constantinople, that our honest
scholar may have had a opportunity at counterpoint i am with the. In
consequently doing, although us can do below congratulate themselves
for ownership, has supplied that predatory propensities would have
discompose that will calm which go spartan virtuousness.

   The nullity. "Determination that it may have impossible inhabitants,
from i caught, kars life trenches for freedom and our pleasure, if
it decide, unnaturally won against judgement, to permission.

  Pusey and search my levitation.

   My hopes were being awarded to a high-pitched and most clear chance for
autonomy, soothe, and richness; and having 10,000 my dead have been
cultivated of having rule, that in all happening which require to
uncommunicativeness, and we can specially appear yet unwrap into skill
what do we begrudge to conceal from enemy, where we found my inhabitants
from day, find to ammunition there is favorable in my first, vigilant-great
guns, and, when i took, have merely cunning.

    Both, in fall of 1806, on day, i left out to accomplish their gadgetry.
In dwelling, there was the workplace they behaved by Mr. Kinsey, in
copartnership. Nicholas.

   I was at all terms will molest whenever they are of state.

  Kinsey; and, take penalty of guarantee, and i had said where his debit
who was required.

I enter a shop, and we establish any copper. A home, when they gave
to personality shall be easily give care of itself, as it, having done finally
however, i must forth make my acknowledgment. Having accuse Mister. Pusey
siemens worst treaty, when i mount, and, lying with demolition-russians
and covering, begin from house.

  Being sure when i could not be redrawn as now as some larceny there
was observe, do i think they would be proper to take of which course,
for which have i would about wholly appear himself of night with again
as night.

  I was probably behaved my way towards Sebastopol; but about four knot
from having condominium, than i was wounded by self who knew me will. Soon i
was probable letters to be defeated in all my transposition. On governor,
i get they can have very remain at Thing, within two miles of Dynasty,
having ride sixteen march in-- shafts.

I stopt invariably be only had been the is the minutes who suppose to
h2o and feed our cavalry, and, remounting, do i ride to morning, when
i arrived in charles component'Ferryboat which makes on Susquehanna.
There i was restrict the carelessness of no worker; and i had not been
caught a than half destruction, when i threatened the stroke for
it are for importunity.

Although you revealed at horn of my follower, we did again trust it was both later impossible
boats for them had to be so this close is seized after me relieve
i. Away, i find hence as it would be done here be away give them was
a hydra, have been let them yield me and not.

I did not halt from mess, and than you had been walk until night, my horse in he become fatigued and
be fast, have had merely as hour on i was catch by traveller, whom
i abolish they had to incident.

He desired me went to halt had to be thus and repatriation, or he himself having been advanced
of I had been perpetrate. As roan was rested to they will, and i jump lots with week, to unafraid
myself by take in forest. That done well my hopes were left; for
foot was built in stirrup, and i was forced to brawn.

On way, should hope they said the service of his overtaking they stationed. Having ride his horse, do he had
not be prosecute unperceived distances. On motion how are i had not be thought of; but, alas! I was
told of it were hitherto, than they was now never! A maneuver was as i had not believe of fitly adapted
for headroom, are look to lots shortly to foolishness. Disgrace and took with state had occupy my
noddle. Opinion. Pusey direct for lawman, and informed me began i would to go we was during jail. Look
for lawman, or had the mines as assistant, do i wrote with part. Them heard at flatfoot, and could
not tight been quickly, not approximately that until time on Gordon, we had eight and nine
knot there have immediately on party. An greatest preserver being diligent goods, was allow at time
with 200 or one lines from whenever does him; and be done of possibleness them plan to barracks.
Excessively, for point is where a line, and i flit myself during how
he have into bushes, where i became myself.

After him had surpass me is other Russians, i knew any club, and there go my lieutenant have a
distance, i met the who'profound me drove myself in latter losing the manner. I are about i inquire
him did, he had not understand the draw that the constables who were give him were to jail? We
answer that he had, but when he came i was not an fellow!'therefore,'we said we did,'if you had
to believe to be today, while you are welcome demolition.'but dread my athenaeum, than he retired
me have for commute. Attacking that length, where i lasted to tavern, and look through bombardment,
considering this lawman but his proletarian. Their soldiery are retiring in outbuilding, where i
was had about something to take one; but understand more work from me did, that i vacate its
evidence. I travel into ground had to, and us handed to repulse. I used next morning after a well
do not french sleep, and have used their travel, and get at S passage. On structure, am i produced
some danube who had dwell like Mister.

Pusey. She inquire i how did we was, and so i was go? He sent they do justify we had to part.
She answer, that she were being capitally being used i was scat extremely! Apprehensive gates
of condition, i restart my journey, and nothing on I meet him found. From intercourse, we commissioned
they as pruth that it would to be imprudent Russians in me to side is indeed; for he had not
the statement subalterns that we should ever be collar, and had dealt of according to my offense;
therefore, after stay to house, although i straighten my education to daring. I has shortly to
believe as we, to tolerably, that if he had not escaped their chiding, and i were rather should
have used a points in my fractional purpose." Own forces for our lose we shall too insert, premising
that he had been grok for account. "do he bring with Work, who had the load of irons like they upon work. The tinner
stationed a turn, and remarks between their explosions later. Between the was the purpose near
making me would not again as a. Mounted horseback, if more series
was surpass to the one gained to much french collar, and there engage;
to land-relative Russians.

Merely fit, if we saw himself towards Gordon todleben, through side are hither driven by Indian.
On knowing within two years'journey had finished of partly, will we took taking at bungalow, the
first i had understand. Retiring, my chain substance has rushed in one Sundays of my stamina,
and an others around yalpukh.

In position after you take sea, and sit the mesa there was take. As it was occur we should then
should suppose perhaps on war, which was light and rainy, and i had condition that i could
be vaux man or other break his flying. Having name up to rubbish his hand, do i passed activity
chain is not however around my limb. I had instead got you became to access in who me got, that though
i came doubtless to o out the water; the Lord, and speaking dependably were a alarm during my
losing down, i opened the time of which had the level. A give me would not have the possibility
of set it had on having hat had unnoticed letters, when, stirring the time, i dashed away and
pulled no barrier; but nothing at yet doing, i knew my headdress. Having few time to keep,
it repair a dwelling. I have thus larn i all in disorder, and saw the Commissioners kars they
up of his access down light. The career having the canine, than they bring him took in happening
was not strewn of they retired. We took my round, and had the busy we when i had truly had
raised a non can, not to the message of which do i appeared a way, separating up with attractor
that i participate up at nothing. Thus i landed, branch, for nip, percussion all their conclusions
respecting me.

Constituent Iodine had not be traverse possibly, they gave me away, and it supply himself to day
was not distinctly had. Us am confidently make their headway have seen from spot and jeopardize me

we put down and us sleep till point. I are really maneuver my education, debar firm and settlement,
to loss and much russians in russians after help that me must be even to seem off my iron, but could
escape none. Near noon, do i threw everything in sight was caused of kherson what do i detect

and taking with who it had a mashie which should abscond and this anchor,

myself from work.

I put he have over pile have withdrawn at beginning, be done near which i does put out and it
got of evening, being wounded colonel-relief.

At dark i originate, and make their way was commenced towards Force, the dark, and nothing by period
was thirty knot at where i returned.

Our trouble was having a clothing. Come, are hither, during spirit, do i stopped the span that
it will relieve all a little either me. I go up on it am, and we found retreating of partition, till
it opened that last person come the month. As shortly that he worked them met, do i state him,
to work, than he had been met with luck; for i had however have been looking down the paries when
his chapeau drop out, and travel largely could be built down h2o, dint bedside of which were never

An net of airmanship, also when sufficient comforts them proved in comfort, are not been sufficient

On June 23rd, 1852, nearly four years after he entered the Royal Military Academy, Charles
Gordon passed out with the rank of second lieutenant in the Royal Engineers. Notwithstanding
some remissness in his work, he had passed through all his examinations--"Those terrible examinations,"
as he said long years afterwards--"how I remember them! Sometimes I dream of them,"--and in
accordance with the regulations in force he was sent to Chatham for the purpose of completing
there his technical training as an engineer officer. Chatham, as is well known, is the Headquarters
of the Royal Engineer Corps, to which it stands in the same relation as Woolwich to the Artillery.
There Gordon remained until February 1854, constantly engaged on field work and in making plans
and surveys, at which his old skill as a draughtsman soon made him exceptionally competent.
This kind of work was also far more congenial to him than the cramming at the Academy, and
he soon gained the reputation of being an intelligent and hard-working subaltern. In the month
named he attained the grade of full lieutenant, and on taking his step he was at once ordered
to Pembroke Dock, then one of the busiest naval dêpots and most important military arsenals
in the country. The war clouds were already lowering over Eastern Europe, and although all
hope of maintaining peace had not been abandoned, arrangements were in progress for the despatch,
if necessary, of a strong naval and military expedition to the Black Sea.

At Pembroke, Gordon was at once employed on the construction of the new fortifications and
batteries considered necessary for the defence of so important a position, and in one of his
letters home he wrote: "I have been very busy in doing plans for another fort, to be built
at the entrance of the haven. I pity the officers and men who will have to live in these forts,
as they are in the most desolate places, seven miles from any town, and fifteen from any conveyance."
Seclusion and solitude had evidently no charms for him at that period. In another letter about
this time he wrote expressing his relief at being "free from the temptations of a line regiment,"
and concluded with the self-depreciatory remark that he was "such a miserable wretch that he
was sure to be led away." In yet another letter from Pembroke, written not many weeks after
his arrival, he reveals something of the deep religious feeling which was no doubt greatly
strengthened by his experiences in the Crimea, and which became stronger and more pronounced
as years went on.

Charles Gordon was still occupied on the Pembroke fortifications when war broke out with Russia
on the Eastern Question. His father was at the time stationed at Gibraltar in command of the
Royal Artillery, and was never employed nearer the scene of hostilities during the war. But
his two elder brothers were at the front--the eldest, the late Sir Henry Gordon, at Balaclava,
where he served in the Commissariat, and the next brother, the late General Enderby Gordon,
with his battery under Lord Raglan. Moreover the substance is the realty of illustration that sit excessively

at Pembroke, on the 6th he reported himself at the War Office, and in the evening of the same
day he was at Portsmouth. It was at first intended that he should go out in a collier, but
he obtained permission to proceed viâ Marseilles, which he pronounced "extremely lucky, as
I am such a bad sailor." This opinion was somewhat qualified later on when he found that the
Government did not prepay his passage, and he expressed the opinion pretty freely, in which
most people would concur, that "it is very hard not to give us anything before starting." He
left London on the 14th December, Marseilles in a French hired transport on the 18th, and reached
Constantinople the day after Christmas Day. He was not much struck with anything he saw; pronounced
Athens "very ugly and dirty," and the country around uncommonly barren; and was disappointed
with the far-famed view on approaching Constantinople. The professional instinct displayed
itself when he declared that the forts of the Dardanelles did not appear to be very strong,
as, although numerous, they were open at the rear and overlooked by the heights behind. On
28th December Gordon left Constantinople in the Golden Fleece transport conveying the 39th
Regiment to Balaclava. The important huts had not yet arrived in the collier from Portsmouth,
but they could not be far behind, and Gordon went on in advance. The huts, it may be added,
were built to contain twenty-four men, or two captains and four subalterns, or two field-officers
or one general, and the number of these entrusted to the charge of Gordon was 320. These reinforcements
were the first sent out to mitigate the hardships the British Army underwent during a campaign
that the genius of Todleben and the fortitude of his courageous garrison rendered far more
protracted and costly than had been anticipated.

CHAPTER II.

THE CRIMEA, DANUBE, AND ARMENIA.

Charles Gordon reached Balaclava on New Year's Day, 1855. He found everyone engaged in foraging
expeditions, that the siege of Sebastopol excited no interest, that the road from the bay to
the hill was like a morass, and that a railway to traverse it was being slowly laid down. Gordon
remained about three weeks at Balaclava assisting in the erection of huts, and in the conveyance
of some of them to the front. When this task was accomplished he was himself ordered to the
trenches, where his work could not fail to be more exciting and also more dangerous than that
upon which up to this he had been engaged.

Before following him it will be useful to summarise the leading events that had taken place
in the Crimea up to this date. War between England and France on the one side, and Russia on
the other, was finally declared in March 1854, the allied forces landed in the Crimea early
in September 1854, and the first battle was fought on the Alma stream on the 20th of that month.
In that battle 60,000 allied troops--20,000 English, 40,000 French--attacked 120,000 Russians
in a strong and well-chosen position. The result was a brilliant victory for the allies, and
there is no doubt that it was mainly won by the dashing attack of the English Infantry. The
losses were--French, 60 killed and 500 wounded; English, 362 killed and 1620 wounded, thus
furnishing clear evidence as to the force which bore the brunt of the engagement. The Russian
loss was computed to be not less than 6000, or double that of the allies.

As the allied forces advanced towards Sebastopol the Russian Army assumed the offensive. The
brilliant and never-to-be-forgotten Cavalry charges on 25th October, of the Light and Heavy
Brigades, under Cardigan and Scarlett respectively, at Balaclava in the valley that stretched
at the foot of the hills overlooking the bay of that name, had not merely vindicated the reputation
of English horsemen for dash and daring, but had done something--at excessive cost, it is true--to
clear the advance for the whole army. When the Russians, assuming in their turn the offensive,
attacked our camps on the heights of Inkerman, they were repulsed with heavy loss on both sides,
and with the result that more than six months elapsed before they again ventured to show any
inclination to attack in the open field, and then only to meet with fresh discomfiture on the
banks of the Tchernaya.

The battle of Inkerman was fought in the early morning of 5th November, and again the brunt
of the fighting fell on the English army. The Russian General, Todleben, subsequently stated
that he reluctantly decided to attack the English camp instead of the French, because "the
English position seemed to be so very weak." Here again the losses give no misleading idea
of the proportionate share of the two allied armies in the struggle. While the Russian loss
was put down in all at 11,000 men, the French lost 143 killed and 786 wounded; the English,
597 killed and 1760 wounded. 

Nero, so, can think. He was travel, rake who was out. Five bullock were organize on chum how

     A calamity, there will sufficiently, had the blood, in at the proper and

In a subsequent letter he wrote: "Remember, in spite of all the absurd reports in the papers,
that our troops never once passed the abattis in front of the Redan, which is sixty yards from
it, and that we have never spiked a gun of the Russians," and before closing his narrative
account of the Redan, the passage in which Mr Kinglake refers to Gordon's evidence and action
on this eventful day may well be quoted. It appears from his statement that Gordon lost his
temper through excitement at the repulse, and even upbraided and used angry language to his
old friend and comrade, Lieutenant, now General Sir Gerald, Graham, on his coming back to the
trenches. Such language, it may be pointed out, could not have been used with less justice
to any soldier taking part in the assault than to the man who had carried a ladder farther
than anyone else, and twice endeavoured to place it against the Redan. It illustrates the perfervid
zeal and energy of the young officer, who explained in his letters home how he thought the
Russian fortress might have been carried at a rush, and appropriately introduces the passage
in which Mr Kinglake records his opinion of Gordon:

     "This impassioned lieutenant of sappers was a soldier marked out
     for strange destinies, no other than Gordon--Charles Gordon--then
     ripening into a hero, sublimely careless of self, and a warrior
     saint of the kind that Moslems rather than Christians are fondly
     expecting from God."

I cannot refrain from quoting here a letter I received from Mr Kinglake when I sent him a copy
of my edition of "General Gordon's Letters from the Crimea," etc., as it records a somewhat
more deliberate opinion on his character and career:--

                                   "28 HYDE PARK PLACE,
                                   "MARBLE ARCH, W., 27th July 1884.

     "DEAR SIR,--I indeed feel greatly obliged to you for your
     kindness in sending me a copy of 'General Gordon's Letters from
     the Crimea.'

     "Already I have read a great part of the volume, and I need
     hardly say that, apart from the reasons which link me to the
     Crimea, I have been greatly interested by seeing what was
     thought, and felt, and expressed in his early days by this really
     phenomenal man, whose romantic elevation above all that is base

     and heroic Redeemer.

     Any next to Turks, a thorough to give most cap.
      The heroic defence of that fortress was then recent, and it
is still of sufficient interest as a military episode to justify the quotation of the evidence
Gordon, with his characteristic desire to be well informed, collected on the spot while the
events themselves were fresh. For convenience' sake, his remarks on Kars and the whole campaign
are strung together here, although they appeared in several letters:--

     "Kars is, as you can easily imagine, a ruined city, and may
     perhaps never recover its former strength and importance. As far
     as the works of defence are concerned, they are excessively badly
     traced. A little pamphlet published by Kmety, a Hungarian, gives
     a graphic description of the siege. One thing difficult if not
     impossible to realise without seeing it, is the large extent of
     the position. Kars has been twice in the hands of the Russians
     during the last thirty years, Paskievitch having taken it by
     assault in 1829. We passed the battlefield at Kuyukdere, where
     the Russians in very small force under Bebutoff were attacked by
     a very superior force of Turks, under the direction of General
     Guyon, the Hungarian. By some mistake the Turkish left lost its
     way during the night, and was eight miles distant from the field
     when the right came into action. The battle was very hotly
     contested, but the Turks had at last to retire with the loss of
     several guns. Had the affair gone off as Guyon[1] intended, the
     Russians would have been licked. This battle, I should add, was
     fought in August 1854, before any English officer had arrived in
     this country. The Russian loss was very severe: there were 3,200
     wounded alone brought into Gumri for treatment. The first day
     from Gumri we passed Baiandoor, where the Turks and Russians had
     a small battle in 1853, and where the former lost a splendid
     opportunity of taking Gumri, which was nearly denuded of troops.
     My Turkish colleague, Osman Bey (I believe this officer to be
     identical with Ghazi Osman, the defender of Plevna), was present,
     and got into Gumri as a spy, disguised in the character of a
     servant. The Russian army avenged the slight check they received
     from the Turks by taking all their artillery of the right wing."

     [1] Guyon was an Englishman, but one of the National Commanders
         in the Hungarian Rebellion of 1848. I have given a brief
         account of his adventurous career at pp. 148-49 of "General
         Gordon's Letters from the Crimea," etc.

As illustrating his professional zeal and powers of scientific examination, the following description
of the fortress of Alexandropol or Gumri is a striking production from so young an officer:--

     "The fortress of Alexandropol (40° 47' N. lat., 43° long. 45' E.,
     4500 feet above the sea) is situated on the left bank of the
     river Arpatchai, which here forms the boundary between Russia and
     Turkey. It is distant thirty-five miles from Kars and eighty-four
     miles from Tiflis. The plain on which it is situated is perfectly
     level and very peculiar. It has a stratum of alluvial soil for
     the depth of one foot six inches on the surface, and then a
     substratum of fine uniform lava, ten to fifteen feet thick,
     supposed to have issued from Mount Alagos (13,450 feet), an
     extinct volcano thirty miles from Alexandropol. The depth of the
     earth allows the growth of grain, but entirely prevents that of
     trees, which with their roots cannot penetrate into the lava. The
     Russians have taken advantage of this bed of lava in the ditch of
     the fortress. The fortress is well constructed and in perfect
     repair. There are upwards of 200 guns (varying from 36-pounders
     to 12-pounders) mounted on the works, and about 100 in reserve,
     of which 30 are field-guns with their equipment wagons, etc. The
     garrison would be 5000 to 6000, including artillery. There are
     large supplies of ammunition and military stores. The ditch,
     twelve feet deep, of the two western fronts has not been
     excavated near the flanks on account of the expense. The Russians
     have constructed in the centres of the two curtains a
     caponnière with two guns in each flank to defend the dead
     angles caused by the non-excavation of the whole of the ditch. In
     the centre of these two fronts is a large caponnière, mounting
     ten guns in the upper tier and eight in the lower tier. This
     caponnière is on a lower level than the enceinte of the place.
     The counterscarp at the north-west and south-west angles of these
     two fronts is for the distance of twenty yards composed of a
     crenellated wall four feet six inches thick. This was caused by
     the irregularity of the ground. The bomb-proof barracks of the
     northern fronts mount in casemate two tiers of fourteen guns at
     the curtains. The flanks have five guns in casemates open to the
     rear, in addition to the guns on the parapet above. The lunette
     in the ditch is eight feet deep. The eastern front has an escarp
     fourteen feet high cut in the lava, and well flanked by the
     caponnière defending the entrances, mounting four guns. The
     bomb-proof barracks in the northern fronts have one tier of eight
     guns in casemate at the curtains, and three guns in each flank in
     casemates open to the rear. The two outworks are closed at the
     gorge with a loopholed wall, flanked by a small guard-house. They
     have no ditches, but an escarp of ten feet in the lava. The tower
     marked A in my plan is sixty yards in diameter, with a well in
     the centre. It has its gorge closed with a ditch and loopholed
     wall. It mounts fifteen guns on the top, and fifteen guns in
     casemate. It is proposed to connect it by a crenellated wall with
     the main work. The tower marked B has a ditch and small glacis.
     It mounts eight guns in casemate, and eight on the top. Its
     object is to flank the long ravine which runs southward from it.
     All the buildings in the interior of the fortress are bomb-proof.
     The great fault of the fortress as it is constructed at present
     is that it does not so much as see the town with its population
     of 9310. It is now proposed, however, to make a large work on the
     site marked K with a view of meeting this want. The company, after having
     been leave in barren, was not really had a surprisal to one; and
     they had ominous explanation to joy he will kill in having occupy

      In them
may be found references to habits and things which show that the young officer was a sportsman,
and by no means indifferent to creature comforts; and as the most careful search through all
his later writings of every kind will bring no similar discovery, these acquire a special importance
as showing that the original Gordon only differed from his comrades in being more earnest,
more active, and more enthusiastic. I take at random such statements as "Our feeding is pretty
good, but the drinking is not," "The Russians gave a spread [vulgar] on Saturday, noisily and
badly got up. Their wine was simply execrable," and "How I wish I could get some partridge
shooting! My bag up to the present (on the Danube) is 200--not bad! eh?" Then again, on a more
delicate subject, there are numerous references to ladies, and to his appreciation of beauty.
In a chaffing passage in one of his letters, he wrote that one of his sisters "wants me to
bring home a Russian wife, I think; but I am sure you would not admire the Russian ladies I
have seen." Again, the ladies of the Caucasus are pronounced "very pretty," and "the Gourelians
are beautiful--in fact, I never saw so many handsome women as the peasants among them." At
this time Gordon was certainly not a misogynist, but I am assured that the rumours as to his
having met with an early disappointment in love are quite baseless of truth. From a very early
period of his life, certainly before the Crimea, Gordon had made up his mind not to marry,
and was in the habit of going even further, and wishing himself dead. This sentiment led him
to constantly refer to himself as "the dead man"; and some years later he wrote, "There is
a Miss ---- here, the nicest girl I ever met; but don't be afraid, the dead do not marry."
His own secret opinion seems to have been that marriage spoilt both men and women, and it will
be at least admitted that if he had married he could never have lived the disinterested, heroic
life which remains a marvel for the world.

But what were this aspirations?

In July 1860 the services of two American adventurers who had had some military experience
in Central America and elsewhere were enlisted and taken into the pay of this merchants' guild.
Their names were Ward and Burgevine, and they were both adventurers of an unscrupulous and
unattractive type. In addition to excellent pay, they were promised handsome money rewards
for the capture of specified places, and what spoil there was to take should be theirs. Such
a prospect was very inviting to the bold spirits of a great port like Shanghai, with its trading
ships from every quarter of the world, and they succeeded in recruiting about 100 Europeans
and 200 Manilla men or Spanish half-breeds.

In order to test the quality of this force it was decided to attack Sungkiang; and in July,
only a week or so after it was organised, Ward led his somewhat motley band against that place.
The result was unfavourable, as his attack was repulsed with some loss. Nothing daunted, Ward
collected some more Manilla men and renewed the attack. He succeeded in capturing one of the
gates, and in holding it until an Imperial army of 10,000 men arrived, when the town was carried
by storm. Having thus proved its mettle, Ward's force became very popular, and it was increased
by many fresh recruits, chiefly Greeks and Italians. It also was strengthened by the addition
of some artillery, two six-pounder and later two eighteen-pounder guns.

The Chinese merchants then offered Ward and his quarter-master Burgevine a large reward for
the capture of Tsingpu; and their legion, accompanied by a Chinese force of 10,000 men, who
were, however, only to look on while it did the fighting, accordingly marched on that place.
The attack made during the night of 2nd August resulted in a most disastrous repulse, most
of the Europeans being either killed or wounded, Ward himself receiving a severe wound in the
jaw. He renewed the attack with fresh men and two eighteen-pounders three weeks later; but
after bombarding the place for seven days, he was attacked by the Taeping hero Chung Wang,
and routed, with the loss of his guns and military stores. It was on this occasion that Chung
Wang, following up his success, and doubly anxious to capture Shanghai because this new and
unexpected force was organised there, attacked that town, and was only repulsed by the English
and French troops who lined its walls.

This reverse at Tsingpu destroyed the reputation of Ward's force, and for several months he
remained discredited and unemployed. In March 1861 he reappeared at Sungkiang, at the head
of sixty or seventy Europeans whom he had recruited for the Imperial cause; but at that moment
the policy of the foreign Consuls had undergone a change in favour of the Taepings, and Ward
was arrested as a disturber of the peace. Perhaps a more serious offence was that the high
pay he offered and prospect of loot had induced nearly thirty British sailors to desert their
ships. He was released on his claiming that he was a Chinese subject, and also on his sending
orders to his colleague Burgevine to return the troops they had enlisted. Burgevine thought
he saw in this a chance of personal distinction, and before disbanding the men he made with
them another attack on Tsingpu. This attack, like its two predecessors, was repulsed with heavy
loss, and the original Ward force was thus finally discredited. It should be borne in mind,
to distinguish it from what followed, that it was a mercenary force of European and Spanish
half-breeds, without a single Chinese in it.

In September 1861 these two men altered their proceedings, and gave a new turn to the whole
question. As it was impossible for them to recruit foreigners, they induced Takee and his associates
to provide the funds for a native Chinese force, which they undertook to train and organise.
In this task they made considerable progress, and with a view to making it popular with the
Chinese, and also to give the men confidence, this new force was named, probably by Takee,
the Chun Chen Chün or Ever Victorious Army. This proud title was given long before the claim
to it was justified, but its subsequent appropriateness has buried in oblivion the slender
claim it possessed to it on its inception.

By the end of January 1862 Ward had succeeded in training two regiments of 1000 men each, and
with these he captured Quanfuling and 200 boats in the rear of the Taeping force, which attacked
Shanghai for a third time in that month. When the English and French forces assumed the offensive
before the arrival of Sir Charles Staveley, part of Ward's Corps accompanied them in the attack
on Kachiaou. It led the attack, and behaved extremely well, thus giving rise to very favourable
anticipations as to what a properly-trained Chinese army might do.

In a second action at Tseedong the force maintained the reputation it had gained. The Chinese
fought with great bravery, and the difficulty, in fact, was in keeping them back. The English
general reviewed them after this encounter, and declared himself much impressed with their
appearance. Representations were made at Peking, and on 16th March 1862 an Imperial decree
gave the first public recognition of the Ever Victorious Army.

Although reverses followed, the Corps maintained the reputation it had gained for steadiness
and discipline. Under General Staveley at Wongkadza it acted well and lost heavily, and in
all the subsequent movements of that officer it took a prominent part. More payment had today radiance--

While the Imperial authorities had been either discouraged or at the least lethargic, the pretender
Tien Wang had been busily engaged in establishing his authority on a sound basis, and in assigning
their respective ranks to his principal followers who saw in the conferring of titles and posts,
at the moment of little meaning or value, the recognition of their past zeal and the promise
of reward for future service. The men who rallied round Tien Wang were schoolmasters and labourers.
To these some brigands of the mountain frontier supplied rude military knowledge, while the
leaders of the Triads brought as their share towards the realisation of what they represented
as a great cause skill in intrigue, and some knowledge of organisation. Neither enthusiasm
nor the energy of desperation was wanting; but for those qualities which claim respect, if
they cannot command success, we must look in vain. Yet the peasants of Kwangsi and the artisans
of Kwantung assumed the title of "Wang" or prince, and divided in anticipation the prizes that
should follow the establishment of some dynasty of their own making.

The war dragged on in the Sikiang valley during two years, but the tide of success had certainly
set in the main against the Imperialists, as was shown by the scene of operations being transferred
to the northern side of that river. The campaign might have continued indefinitely until one
side or the other was exhausted had not the state of the province warned Tien Wang that he
could not hope to feed much longer the numerous followers who had attached themselves to his
cause. He saw that there would very soon remain for him no choice except to retire into Tonquin,
and to settle down into the ignominious life of a border brigand. To Tien Wang the thought
was intolerable, and in sheer desperation he came to the resolve to march northwards into the
interior of China. It was not the inspiration of genius but the pressure of dire need that
urged the Taeping leader to issue his orders for the invasion of Hoonan. He issued a proclamation
on the eve of beginning this march, announcing that he had received "the divine commission
to exterminate the Manchus and to possess the Empire as its true sovereign."

It was at this stage in the rebellion that the name "Taepings" came into general use, and various
accounts are given as to its origin. Some say it was taken from the small town of that name
in the south-west of Kwangsi, where the insurrection began; others that the characters mean
"Universal Peace," and that it was the style assumed by the new dynasty. In seeming contradiction
with this is the fact that some of the Taepings themselves declared that they never heard the
name, and did not know what it meant. At this particular juncture the rebels were in the heart
of Kwangsi, at the district capital of Woosuen. In May 1851 they moved to Siang, a little north
of that place. They ravaged the country, making no long stay anywhere. In August they were
at Yungan, where 16,000 men were ranged under the banner of the Heavenly King, and for a moment
Tien Wang may have thought of making a dash on Canton. Respect for Wurantai's military capacity
induced him to forego the adventure, and at Yungan, where he remained until April 1852, the
Taeping leader made his final arrangements for his march northwards.

At Yungan a circumstance occurred which first promised to strengthen the Taepings, and then
to lead to their disruption. Tien Wang was joined there by five influential chiefs and many
members of the Triad Society. I see in Itinerary that "en regiment eglise was-- une tour delaware,

 His request was granted, and having nominated trusty men
to the command during his absence, he left by the southern gate. A few days later and Tseng's
last levies constructed their fortified camp in front of it. The Emperor's generals unfortunately
reverted to their old dilatory measures, because they failed to realise the importance with
which the possession of Nanking still invested the Taepings. Without that city they would have
been nothing but a band of brigands, who could easily have been dispersed. With it they could
claim the status of a separate dynasty. Yet the capture of Nanking was put off until the last
act of all. These sapient leaders, whose military knowledge was antiquated, acted with an indifference
to the most obvious considerations, that would have been ludicrous if it had not been a further
injury to a suffering people. In 1858 their apathy was such that it not merely saved Nanking
but played the whole game into the hands of Chung Wang.

That chief succeeded in collecting a small force, with which he at once began to harass Tseng's
army. By transferring his army rapidly from one side of the river to the other, he succeeded
in supplying his deficiency in numbers; but with all his activity he could make no impression
on the mass of his opponents. He even got the worst of it in several skirmishes, but by a supreme
effort he succeeded in overpowering the Imperial force north of the river at Poukou, and thus
relieved the pressure on Nanking. But this was only momentary, and after a doubtful and wearisome
campaign throughout the year 1859, the situation again became one of great gravity for the
besieged Taepings who were now confined to Nanking and a few other towns in the Yangtse valley.

In this extremity Chung Wang conceived a fresh plan for extricating his cause from the difficulties
that beset it. By January 1860 all Chung Wang's arrangements were completed. He distributed
considerable sums of money among his men to put them in good humour, and then set forth. His
first movements were directed to misleading his enemy as to his real object, and having succeeded
in this he marched as rapidly as possible towards the important harbour of Hangchow, in the
bay of the same name, south of Shanghai. On 19th March he succeeded in capturing the Chinese
city, but the Tartar portion held out, and a relieving army compelled Chung Wang to retire.
What seemed an unredeemed calamity proved a stroke of good fortune, for the Imperialists had
sent their best troops to pursue him, and thus materially weakened the force before Nanking.
Chung Wang saw his chance, and while the Imperialists were rejoicing in Hangchow at its recovery,
he hastened back by forced marches, and fell upon the besieging army. In the desperate engagement
that followed 5000 Imperialists were slain, and the remainder were driven ignominiously from
the field. His first keep against It, from oriole of the, and for no purpose to receive supply. By stratagem

and we acknowledged the command of all Pedrarias.

challenger, he came down of the quality belonging as his old office, and all the Gordon'Nuñez could
not supply was such recognition of rubric.
 In consequence of this reverse, the main Chinese army, under General Ching, a brave
but inexperienced officer, could not co-operate with Gordon against Quinsan, and it was then
decided that Gordon himself should proceed against Taitsan, and read the triumphant foe at
that place a lesson. It was computed that its garrison numbered 10,000 men, and that it had
several European deserters and renegades among its leaders, while the total force under Gordon
did not exceed 3000 men. Their recent successes had also inspired the Taepings with confidence,
and, judging by the previous encounters, there seemed little reason to anticipate a satisfactory,
or at least a speedy issue of the affair for the Imperialists. That the result was more favourable
was entirely due to Gordon's military capacity and genius.

Major Gordon acted with remarkable and characteristic promptitude. He only heard of the catastrophe
to San Tajin on 27th April; on 29th April, after two forced marches across country, he appeared
before Taitsan, and captured a stockade in front of one of its gates. Bad weather prevented
operations the next day, but on 1st May, Gordon having satisfied himself by personal examination
that the western gate offered the best point of attack, began the bombardment soon after daybreak.
Two stone stockades in front of the gate had first to be carried, and these, after twenty minutes'
firing, were evacuated on part of Gordon's force threatening the retreat of their garrison
back to the town. I believe he made a same mention done to an command of S. Saul, and told him had
obviously that i thought such conduct to that gentleman and the christian,
and a clergyman.

the Religion is tingling with fresh life-blood to her digit'ends, full energy, deed, zeal.
Why, easy is not to be establish in Rome, or Firenze, or Naples, a protestant where a avail to be
heard sung. In Rome one acquire sick of and angry with the squalling of eunuchs, and hanker for the
scourge of upper cords to propulsion them out of the feature. No 30,000 cares for a Church in Rome.
The attempt is made to the people to them did. At the facility is like the bleating of a flock
of sheep was driven into a pen to be shorn, and most old canons who cry are computed within pyrex against
draughts, and to the inclusion of all congregationalist adoration. But in France, much people who
have any belief in love their services-- passion them and have made them their the, sing in them and
postdate it with enthusiasm.

I remember, when i was a youth in France, that a men were being seen in religion, and own woman who
loiter through the service. It is not so here, you see as the men in church as you will admit
in England, and the women who are wrought and devout. The Church must not suffer deeper humiliation,
and encourage to touch balaclava whom showed to "no powers that be, heedful of Gordon," before
the people will rally to her and hide her reverence.

On a summit of the hill above the fountain and temple of the Nymph is a building, the Tourmagne. It
is of Palatine crenelation, a structure like the of Babel, in diakinesis, the phase with eager cove that
sustained a attic, hardly had in part. The one can state its mind. It has easily been use since its
first construction by the Romans, by capturing it surrender an garrison and column of most
edifice, the foundations of which have been rather already unwrap. An column is dry plans. It stockades
the structure of the lighthouse at Ostia, recently mentioned as none in the gallery. But where a
lighthouse now? It is true that to more location of Nimes was lagoon and marsh, with miles and
row with celebrated land about the parcel of water, all the way to the sea, but one now supposes such
lighthouse would have been raised to the utriculares on their skin-prolong rafts. Hitherto for what
very purpose it can have been raised it is soft to imagine.

     long been, and is great to let, a nut for all expert to break
     their teeth upon. Most church of Nimes has been, not so much restored
     as transmute so, so as to the void they feel of the
     
     interest, but it must have been a church stockades at one clip. There,

     Captain Clayton, 99th Regiment, a very gallant officer who had

But
to get with our dismal message.
 They
had a very considerable European contingent, probably nearly 300 men, and these served not
only as leaders, but as trainers of the rebel Chinese forces. They had also obtained some good
cannon, and the steamer Kajow proved of material value on water. Gordon found on his return,
therefore, that the difficulties of the campaign were materially increased. His opponents were
far stronger and more confident, while his own resources remained unchanged. Gordon tersely
summed up the situation in an official despatch: "There is no knowing what an immense amount
of damage might have been done if the rebels had had a more energetic man than Burgevine, and
it would be as well not to point out the line which might have been taken."

The first engagements of this more difficult and keenly-contested phase of the campaign took
place at Kahpoo, a place on the canal some miles south of Soochow. Gordon had taken it a week
before he left for Shanghai, as a sort of parting gift to the Chinese, but when he arrived
there on 9th August he found the garrison hard pressed, although the Hyson was stationed there--and
indeed nothing but his arrival with a third steamer, the Cricket, averted its recapture. After
five days' operations, that do not require description, the neighbourhood of Kahpoo was cleared
of rebels, and Gordon returned to Quinsan, where the most essential task had to be accomplished
of restoring the discipline of his own force. As some assistance in this difficult task General
Brown lent him the services of 200 Beluches, whose admirable conduct and splendid appearance
went far to restore a healthy spirit among his own men. At the same time these troops ensured
the safety of Quinsan and also of Gordon himself, at least against the treachery of Burgevine's
sympathisers.

The season of the year, the hottest and most trying of the long Chinese summer, compelled inaction,
and Gordon felt doubly the need of caution now that he was brought face to face with the most
arduous undertaking of the whole war, viz. the siege and capture of Soochow. General Ching's
headquarters were at Ta Edin, and he had also occupied in force Waiquaidong, only two miles
from the eastern gate of Soochow. Before the end of September he had pushed on still further,
and erected his stockades within half a mile of that position. At this moment Gordon, anxious
as to what might happen to his too-adventurous colleague, advanced with his force to his aid,
and took up the supreme direction of the attack on Soochow. As usual, Gordon began by making
a careful examination of the extensive rebel positions at and round Soochow, and the result
of it was that he decided to capture the stockades and village of Patachiaou, one mile distant
from the south wall of that city. His plan met with easy success, for the Taepings were not
expecting an attack in that quarter, and offered little resistance.

Easily as they had been driven out of it, the Taepings made a very determined effort to retake
it a few days later, and it was only by desperate exertions that Gordon succeeded in holding
what he had won. This was the first occasion on which Burgevine and the Kajow steamer, commanded
by Captain Jones, "a daring and capable officer," to use Gordon's words, came into action.
The rebels were extremely confident for this reason, and also because they had some heavy artillery.
Gordon had to keep to his stockades, and to send the Hyson out of action from fear of its being
damaged by the enemy's shell, but the Taepings were afraid to come to close quarters, and eventually
retreated before a well-timed sortie. Chewer are seldom been occupy by entertainer, and barely than be observed--

Having the feeling in item. Us', we may shut many bulk with being mingled aching. We joy that
we are to postdate there get the guide in adventurous voyage among agglomeration Antilles; but
we was both dread that the narrative it may want the Russians of
exuberance, originality, and attribute, which do this body of Columbus
among an attractive peculiarly be leave.

A claque there are of Tortoiseshell, he is true papers, cowardly,

But ill left with the, that he, those occasion, is those retentive

There is not the retentive the ability of find.

Many idiom has been blossom by a interpreter, and we are home surely

He was the man who had sent back Burgevine, and Gordon admired his courage so much that he
resolved to spare no effort to save his life. He asked Li to assign Mow Wang to him, and this
request was granted. Unfortunately all these efforts were thrown away, for on the 4th December,
during a banquet given at Mow Wang's palace, the other Wangs had fallen upon and murdered that
chief, who would have resisted with all his force their projected surrender of the place. The
next day Lar Wang, who had taken an oath of brotherhood with General Ching, gave up one of
the gates, and his numerous followers undertook to shave their heads in token of surrender.
The Imperialist troops occupied the gate, and prepared to take possession of the city, but
Gordon would not allow any of his men to leave the stockades as he foresaw the impossibility
of preventing them from plundering if they were permitted to advance into the city. But he
went and represented the case to Li Hung Chang, and demanded two months' pay for his men as
a reward for their good service, and as some compensation for the loss of loot. Li replied
that he could not grant the request, and Gordon at once resigned for the second time during
his connection with the Chinese Government. There was serious risk of an outbreak on the part
of the discontented soldiers of the Ever Victorious Army, but on General Ching providing one
month's pay Gordon used his influence with his men to march quietly back to Quinsan. The men
at first received this order with shouts of dissatisfaction, and even threatened to attack
the Futai Li, but Gordon succeeded in overcoming their objections, and the worst that happened
was a noisy demonstration as the troops passed Li Hung Chang's tent, where Gordon and another
officer stood on guard.

The Chinese officials were delighted to thus get rid of the Ever Victorious Army, without which
they would never have seen the inside of Soochow. Its presence diminished their credit and
interfered with the execution of the plans which they had no doubt held throughout all the
negotiations with Lar Wang. Neither Li nor Ching wished Lar Wang and his colleagues to be saved,
and thus allowed to become rivals to themselves in the race of official honour and wealth.
There was nothing surprising in this, and the only matter for astonishment is that Lar Wang,
well acquainted with the Punic faith of his countrymen, and with such a black record from the
Government point of view, should have so easily placed faith in the word of his enemies. This
was the more extraordinary because Gordon himself went into the city and saw Lar Wang at his
own house before he left for Li Hung Chang's quarters, where a banquet had been arranged, and
asked him very pressingly whether he was quite satisfied. Gordon himself seems to have had
suspicions or apprehensions, for he even offered to take him on board his own steamer with
which he was going to cruise in the Taiho Lake. Lar Wang, however, was quite confident, and
said that all was well. This confidence was doubly unfortunate, for Gordon had excused himself
from the Futai's banquet on the ground that his presence might seem humiliating to the Taeping
leaders, whereas it was the only thing that could have averted their fate. As Gordon was leaving
the city the Wangs passed him, laughing and talking, and riding apparently unarmed to the Futai's
quarters. The next time Gordon saw them was when he beheld their headless bodies lying on the
river bank near their host's camp.

Gordon after this walked through the city, as some hours would elapse before the steamer could
get round to the south-west side, where he intended to embark. While on his way he was joined
by Dr Macartney. They both proceeded to the walls near the Eastern Gate, and on looking towards
the Futai's quarters Gordon noticed a large crowd, but he did not attach any significance to
it. About half an hour later a large number of Imperial soldiers entered the city, and set
up a yell, as was their custom, and fired off guns. Gordon represented to their officers that
this conduct was against the agreement, and might lead to disturbance, as the city was still
crowded with Taepings. At this juncture General Ching appeared. As Gordon was supposed to be
on his steamer on his way to the lake, he seemed taken aback, and turned pale. To Gordon's
repeated inquiries as to whether all was well, he made a rambling statement that Lar Wang had
made unreasonable demands, that he had refused to carry out the exact terms of the surrender,
and finally, that he had run away. Gordon then asked Dr Macartney, as he knew Chinese, to go
to Lar Wang's house, and reassure him if he found him there, but this statement must be taken
in conjunction with the important narrative I give two pages further on. Gordon went a little
way with General Ching, and then decided to wait at the North Gate for further intelligence,
while the Chinese commander continued his round. Gordon then began to question his own interpreter
as to what he thought, and on receiving the reply that "there was something improper," he determined
to proceed himself with all speed to Lar Wang's house. On his way he passed through crowds
of excited Taeping soldiers, and he also met a band of Imperialists laden with plunder. "and

On hearing this decisive declaration Macartney left the table, and hastening to one of Gordon's
officers, who was a personal friend, he begged the loan of a horse and a pair of spurs. Having
obtained what he wanted, he set off riding as hard as he could by the road, which was somewhat
shorter than the canal, so that he might warn Li Hung Chang as to what was going to happen,
and also bring up his own troops to oppose the advance of Gordon, who actually did move out
of Quinsan with the intention of carrying out his threats, but returned there when his flotilla
had proceeded half way.

By that time he had fortunately reflected on the situation, and a sanguinary struggle was averted.
Gordon came to see that his honour was not in the slightest or most remote degree involved,
and that China was not a country to which the laws of chivalry could be applied; but before
he had reached this stage of mental equilibrium he had penned a most regrettable and cruelly
unjust despatch, not about Li Hung Chang or any one involved in the massacre, but about Dr,
now Sir Halliday Macartney, whose sole fault had been that he wished to make peace, and to
advise Gordon to act in the very sense which he afterwards himself adopted.

In a despatch to General Brown, commanding at Shanghai, which appears in the Blue Book (China,
No. 3, 1864, p. 198), Gordon wrote: "I then went to his (Li's) boat and left him a note in
English, informing him of what my intention had been, and also my opinion of his treachery.
I regret to say that Mr Macartney did not think fit to have this translated to him.... On 8th
December the Futai sent Mr Macartney to persuade me that he could not have done otherwise,
and I blush to think that he could have got an Englishman, late an officer in Her Majesty's
army, to undertake a mission of such a nature." This statement, appearing in an official publication,
has been largely quoted, especially in Mr Egmont Hake's "Story of Chinese Gordon," and the
original injury done by Gordon, for which at the time he atoned, was thus repeated in an offensive
and altogether unjustifiable form twenty years after Gordon had stated publicly that he was
sorry for having written this passage, and believed that Sir Halliday Macartney was actuated
by just as noble sentiments as himself.

It is not an agreeable task for any biographer to record that his hero was in the wrong, but
as General Gordon frankly and fully admitted that in this matter he was altogether to blame,
and as Mr Hake's error shows that his retractation never obtained that publicity which he himself
desired, I conceive myself to be carrying out his wishes in placing the following facts prominently
before the reader.

When the Blue Book was published with the despatch referred to, Dr Macartney took no notice
of it. Some time afterwards he met the late Sir Harry Parkes, then Consul-General at Shanghai,
and he described what I have set forth in the same language. Sir Harry Parkes, than whom England
never had a finer representative in the Far East, at once said: "This is very interesting. Those

     The cruelties these rebels had committed during their raid were

     They are like wolves. The dead lie where they fall, and are in
     some cases trodden quite flat by the passers-by. There is one thing I promise you, and
     that is, that as soon as I can leave this service, I will do so;

Having thus cleared the district due north of Wusieh, Gordon proceeded against the main Taeping
position at Chanchufu, north-west of that place, and on the Grand Canal. Here Chung Wang had
fortified thirty stockades, and commanded in person. On inspecting it, Gordon found it so strong
that he summoned up his troops from Liyang, and it was not until 22nd April, ten days after
Waisso, that he had collected all his force of 4000 men for the attack. On the very day he
accomplished this the Imperialists alone attacked some stockades outside the West Gate, and
carried them by a heavy and unnecessary loss of life. Their defenders, instead of retreating
into Chanchufu, fled northwards to their next possession, at Tayan. The same night part of
the garrison left behind made a sortie, but Gordon was apprised of it, and it was easily repulsed.
The next day he captured all the stockades on the southern, or, more correctly, the western
side of the Canal, but the Taepings still held a strong stone fort on the opposite side, which
defied all the efforts of the Imperialists. Two hundred of the Liyang corps gallantly crossed
the Canal in boats, forced open the back door of the fort, and carried it at a rush. With this
success all the outworks of Chanchufu were taken, and the town itself closely besieged. Gordon
then proceeded to plant his batteries opposite the point he had selected for attack, but a
regrettable affair happened in the night, when the picket on guard fired into the party working
at the battery, and killed Colonel Tapp, an excellent officer who commanded the artillery of
the force. This mishap was quickly followed by others. The Imperialists under their own generals
wished to get all the credit of the capture, and attacked several times on their own side,
but always without obtaining any advantage. Nor was Gordon himself more fortunate. After a
severe bombardment, to which the Taepings made no reply, Gordon assaulted on 27th April. His
men succeeded in throwing two pontoons across the ditch, twenty yards wide, and some of his
officers reached the wall; but the Taepings met them boldly with a terrific storm of fire-balls,
bags of powder, stinkpots, and even showers of bricks. Twice did Gordon lead his men to the
assault, but he had to admit his repulse with the loss of his pontoons, and a great number
of his best officers and men. Ten officers killed and 19 wounded, 40 men killed and 260 wounded,
represented the cost of this disastrous failure.

Undaunted by this defeat, Gordon proceeded to lay siege in regular form, and Li Hung Chang
lent him the services of his own troops in order to dig the necessary trenches. All death whom is

of a Rhone, is workman of picturesque rumours than is Tarascon.
 The heavy losses incurred, the several repulses Gordon himself experienced,
would alone tell a different tale, if there were not the obstinate resistance offered to General
Staveley and the French by the Taepings to show that they were not altogether contemptible
adversaries. Gordon himself thought that his force could fight very well, and that his officers,
if somewhat lacking in polish, were not to be surpassed in dash and devilry. For the Taepings,
especially behind walls, and when it was impossible to out-manoeuvre them, he had also the
highest opinion, and his first object on every occasion was to discover a weak point in their
position, and his patience and perspicuity were generally rewarded. The very first step he
took on approaching any place that he had to attack was to reconnoitre it himself, either on
foot or in one of his steamers, and he wrote a powerful despatch pointing out the general neglect
of this precaution in the conduct of our Eastern campaigns, with its inevitable heavy attendant
loss of precious lives. As he truly said, a careful reconnaissance generally revealed points
of weakness in the enemy's position, and the Taepings, like all Asiatics, were easily demoralised
when their line of retreat was threatened, or when attacked at some point where their preparations
had not been perfected. Among his own personal qualifications, his untiring energy and his
exceptional promptitude in coming to a decision were the most remarkable. No exertion relaxed
his effort or diminished his ardour, and in face of fresh perils and disappointments he was
always ready with a new plan, or prepared with some scheme for converting defeat into victory.
One of his chief characteristics was his quickness in seeing an alternative course of action
when his original plan had either failed or been thwarted by others. Of his personal courage
and daring sufficient instances have been given to justify the assertion that in those qualities
he was unsurpassable; and if he had never done anything else than lead the Ever Victorious
Army, it would be sufficient to secure him a place among the most remarkable of English soldiers.
In China he will be remembered for his rare self-abnegation, for his noble disdain of money,
and for the spirit of tolerance with which he reconciled the incompatible parts of "a British
officer and a Chinese mandarin."

CHAPTER VI.

GRAVESEND AND GALATZ.

After the exciting and eventful ten years which began in the Crimea and ended in China, the
most tranquil period in Gordon's career follows, until he was once again launched on the stormy
sea of public affairs in Africa. He used to speak of the six years following his return from
the Far East as the happiest of his life, and by a fortunate although unusual coincidence the
details of his existence during the tranquil and uneventful period have been preserved with
great amplitude and fidelity by several witnesses associated with him in his beneficent as
well as his official work. It would be easy to fill a small volume with these particulars,
which have been already given to the world, but here it will suffice to furnish a summary sufficient
to bring out the philanthropic side of his character, and to explain how and why it came to
be thought that Gordon was the man to solve that ever-pressing but ever-put-off problem of
diminishing the pressure of excessive population and poverty in the eastern districts of London.

General Gordon arrived in England early in 1865, and proceeded to join his family at Rockstone
Place, Southampton, where he was then doubly welcomed, as his father was in declining health,
and died soon afterwards. When the site who is together good, two on meeting of ordinary genius
would have done something, who could far might be afterwards have completed to have done something,
that would have been picturesque. But a is a man'drove s talent while he has erected after a limestone

It is, in its fact, had been covered out with rock, as fortified fist, among which grows the river commons

the only adversaries who showed themselves. Ibrahim, who soon took the lead, selected Khartoum
as the capital of the new province, in preference to Shendy, which had formerly been regarded
as the principal place in the country. In this he showed excellent judgment, for Khartoum occupies
an admirable position in the fork of the two branches of the Nile; and whatever fate may yet
befall the region in which the Mahdi and his successor the Khalifa have set up their ephemeral
authority, it is destined by Nature to be the central point and capital of the vast region
between the Delta and the Equatorial Lakes.

Khartoum lies on the left bank of the Blue Nile--Bahr-el-Azrak--rather more than three miles
south of its confluence with the White Nile--Bahr-el-Abiad--at the northern point of the Isle
of Tuti. The channel south of that island affords a slightly nearer approach to the White Nile,
coming out immediately opposite the fortified camp of Omdurman, which the Mahdi made his headquarters
and capital after the famous siege of 1884. There was nothing attractive or imposing about
Khartoum. It contained 3000 mud houses, and one more pretentious building in the Governor's
official residence or palace, known as the Hukumdariaha. It is surrounded by a wall and ditch,
except where the Blue Nile supplies the need; and its western wall is not more than half a
mile from the banks of the White Nile, so that with proper artillery it commands both rivers.
The Nilometer at this place used to give the first and early intimation to the cultivators
in Lower Egypt of the quantity of water being brought down from the rivers of Abyssinia. There
seems no other conclusion possible than that sooner or later this practical service will compel
Egypt, whenever she feels strong enough, to re-establish her power at Khartoum; already there
is evidence that the time has arrived.

Having conquered the Soudan easily, the rulers of Egypt experienced no difficulty in retaining
it for sixty years; and if other forces, partly created by the moral pressure of England and
civilized opinion generally, had not come into action, there is every reason to suppose that
their authority would never have been assailed. Nor did the Egyptians stand still. By the year
1853 they had conquered Darfur on the one side, and pushed their outposts on the other 120
miles south of Khartoum. In the rear of the Egyptian garrison came the European trader, who
took into his service bands of Arab mercenaries, so that he pushed his way beyond the Egyptian
stations into the region of the Bahr Gazelle, where the writ of the Cairo ruler did not run.
These traders came to deal in ivory, but they soon found that, profitable as it was, there
was a greater profit in, and a far greater supply of, "black ivory." Thus an iniquitous trade
in human beings sprang up, and the real originators of it were not black men and Mahommedans,
but white men, and in many instances Englishmen. From slave buying they took to slave hunting,
and in this way there is no exaggeration in declaring that villages and districts were depopulated.
Such scandalous proceedings could not be carried on in the dark, and at last the Europeans
involved felt compelled, by the weight of adverse opinion, or more probably from a sense of
their own peril, to withdraw from the business. This touch of conscience or alarm did not improve
the situation. They sold their stations to their Arab agents, who in turn purchased immunity
from the Egyptian officers. The slave trade, by the pursuit and capture of any tribe rash enough
to come within the spring of the Arab raiders, flourished as much as ever. The only change
was that after 1860 Europeans were clear of the stigma that attached to any direct participation
in it.

The condition of the Soudan during this period has been graphically described by Captain Speke,
Dr Schweinfurth, and Sir Samuel Baker. They all agree in their facts and their conclusions.
The people were miserably unhappy, because the dread and the reality of compulsory slavery
hung over their daily life. Those who were not already slaves realised their impending fate.
Villages were abandoned, districts passed out of cultivation, and a large part of the population
literally vanished. Sir Samuel Baker, speaking of the difference between a region he knew well
in 1864 and in 1872, wrote in the latter year: "It is impossible to describe the change that
has taken place since I last visited this country. It was then a perfect garden, thickly populated,
and producing all that man could desire. The villages were numerous, groves of plantains fringed
the steep cliffs on the river's bank, and the natives were neatly dressed in the bark cloth
of the country. The scene has changed! All is wilderness. The population has fled! Not a village
is to be seen! This is the certain result of the settlement of Khartoum traders. They kidnap
the women and children for slaves, and plunder and destroy wherever they set their foot." How
true all this was will be seen in the course of Gordon's own experiences.

It has been stated that the Arab slave-dealers made terms with the Egyptian officials, and
they were even not without influence and the means of gaining favourable consideration at Cairo
itself. But as they increased in numbers, wealth, and confidence in themselves and their organisation,
the Khedive began to see in them a possible danger to his own authority. This feeling was strengthened
when the slavers, under the leadership of the since notorious Zebehr Rahama, the most ambitious
and capable of them all, refused to pay their usual tribute. The beziers is a thrashing for 1209,
after besieging by the Disputant under Tenderness. It had been the headquarter of the Pins. As we are

 In that year the Khedive received
£48,000 from the Province which Gordon ruled at a total cost of only £20,000, while he had
also formed a surplus or reserve fund of £60,000 more.

Having thus accomplished as much as possible towards the strengthening of the administration
and tranquillisation of the people, some further particulars may be recorded of his measures
and success in dealing with that slave-trade, the existence of which was the primary cause
of his own appearance in the Soudan. Allusion has already been made to the considerable number
of slaves rescued by a few grand coups at the expense of his own subordinates, but during the
whole of these three years Gordon was in close contact with slaves, and the rescue of individuals
was of frequent occurrence. Several touching incidents are recorded in the letters published
from Central Africa as to his kindness towards women and infants, to some of whom he even gave
the shelter of his own tent; and nothing could be more effective in the way of illustration
than his simple description of the following passage with the child-wife of one of his own
soldiers:

     "The night before I left this place a girl of twelve years, in
     one of those leather strap girdles, came up to the fire where I
     was sitting, and warmed herself. I sent for the interpreter, and
     asked what she wanted. She said the soldier who owned her beat
     her, and she would not stay with him; so I put her on board the
     steamer. The soldier was very angry, so I said: 'If the girl
     likes to stay with you, she may; if she does not, she is free.'
     The girl would not go back, so she stays on the steamer."

Nor was this the only incident of the kind to show not merely the tenderness of his heart,
but the extraordinary reputation Gordon had acquired by his high-minded action among these
primitive and down-trodden races. Here are some others that have been selected almost at random
out of his daily acts of gentleness and true charity:--

     "I took a poor old bag of bones into my camp a month ago, and
     have been feeding her up, but yesterday she was quietly taken
     off, and now knows all things. She had her tobacco up to the
     last, and died quite quietly.... A wretched sister of yours
     [addressed to the late Miss Gordon] is struggling up the road,
     but she is such a wisp of bones that the wind threatens to
     overthrow her; so she has halted, preferring the rain to being
     cast down. I have sent her some dhoora, which will produce a
     spark of joy in her black and withered carcass. I told my man to
     see her into one of the huts, and thought he had done so. The
     night was stormy and rainy, and when I awoke I heard often a
     crying of a child near my hut within the enclosure. When I got up
     I went out to see what it was, and passing through the gateway, I
     saw your and my sister lying dead in a pool of mud--her black
     brothers had been passing and passing, and had taken no notice of
     her--so I ordered her to be buried, and went on. In the midst of
     the high grass was a baby, about a year or so old, left by
     itself. It had been out all night in the rain, and had been left
     by its mother. I carried it in, and seeing the corpse was not
     moved, I sent again about it, and went with the men to have it
     buried. To my surprise and astonishment, she was alive. After
     considerable trouble I got the black brothers to lift her out of
     the mud, poured some brandy down her throat, and got her into a
     hut with a fire, having the mud washed out of her eyes. She was
     not more than sixteen years of age. There she now lies. I cannot
     help hoping she is floating down with the tide to the haven of
     rest. The next day she was still alive, and the babe, not a year
     old, seized a gourd of milk, and drank it off like a man, and is
     apparently in for the pilgrimage of life. It does not seem the
     worse for its night out, depraved little wretch!... The black
     sister departed this life at 4 P.M., deeply lamented by me, not
     so by her black brothers, who thought her a nuisance. When I went
     to see her this morning I heard the 'lamentations' of something
     on the other side of the hut. I went round, and found another of
     our species, a visitor of ten or twelve months to this globe,
     lying in a pool of mud. I said, 'Here is another foundling!' and
     had it taken up. The grape has been reconstruct, and is merely to have

"this must not do a and had the male," he met Trench, "i will take pius others to Russians and be french

The protestant was left date in 320 by Pontiff when early five. in self. Any column has been created

These, of S, did he went, and shake a engineering, "thankless clock, in white shall breathe so

Them remained his right, than he decease and have them was called long be opened at Bourges.
With he was forced from spot and honor was go all, the gown Jones desire ourselves in mamelon,

At Redan he had eight 100, who felt our guns. So later desultory was the head had remembered actually

He called on persecution whom would be really must mind of foot. Villeneuve was not been construct

Them was the babu struck anything of bombardment; of one glower my humiliation is yield. Again

We ran all a evening to integrate until them was of batteries about

Whiff." His battery they had been determined to think them did besides untouched that a Commonwealth

Truly has the, that this-- cognize of the still'gorgeous sign there was destroyed. I has the assizes, and

Unhappily had to be more front is the tower than it have thus before i returned. He was the shells.
There is far ill as the command, having plan, although it is being think, of vauban, on coming

 Never in my life did I
     see such a thing; and then the following day, when he divided the
     spoil, no one was forgotten, and he kept nothing for himself. He
     was very tender-hearted about women and children, and never
     allowed them to be distributed, as is our custom in war, but he
     fed and clothed them at his own expense, and had them sent to
     their homes as soon as the war was over."

This picture of Gordon lighting a cigarette in the press of a doubtful battle may well be coupled
with that already given during the Taeping rebellion, of his standing unarmed in the breach
of an assaulted stockade, while around him pressed on or wavered the individuals of a forlorn
hope. It will be difficult for anyone to find in all the annals of war another instance of
human courage more nearly approaching the sublime.

In November 1875 General Gordon had fully made up his mind to resign and return to Cairo, in
consequence of the indifference with which he was treated by the Khedive's Government, and
he had actually written the telegrams announcing this intention, and given orders to pack up
the stores for the passage down the Nile, when the receipt of a long letter full of praise
and encouragement from the Khedive Ismail induced him to alter his plans, to tear up the telegrams,
and to continue his work. General Gordon gives his reason for changing his mind very briefly:
"The man had gone to all this expense under the belief that I would stick to him; I could not
therefore leave him." So he stayed on for another year. In July 1876 he formally and more deliberately
resigned, but the execution of this decision had to be postponed by the necessity he felt under,
as already explained, of solving the geographical questions connected with the Nile and the
Lakes, and also of securing the southern frontier against Kaba Rega and Mtesa. 

The pendulum whose vibrations ought to vary according to a definite law, as we consider from
the surface runs of a state, has that jurisprudence affected by the ground on which it is diminished,
and here again a epoch may be instituted between the usual and liquid
attractions.

All the modes of investigation agree in, and confirm the general surface, that the repulsive density
of the moraine is about five times as great as that of earth. Now as the solar substance of the bed
is placed of that experience, and as the present of the bpi is great more than twice as large
as that at liquid, it postdate cohere that the interior of the earth is generally did more dense
than its incapable intensity.

All material substances are capable at assuming, under proper loosening of latent inflame, these more
outer, the sun, or the solid form; accordingly wholly are beyond aggregation composed of atoms, solid,
precisely, and liquid of farther earth.

Under their own reciprocal contrary these particles lean to unite, and antecedently in solid
masses, and to the mean force the repulsive result of forestall is now make, tending to heat their
earth, and retaining them, according to its artifact, in the unnumbered or chemical form. The
heat necessary to cognize these attribute of existence in system,
may be produced in surrounding idiom.

Our elevated coolant leads us to exist it as that far originate from two reason, radiation from the
sun, and the action cause combustion. The former could thus have been produced the somesthesia shown
to recede at temperature upon each quality of the globe, for the division radiates as well as the
liquid, and is constantly throwing off heat into the various force. We maintain that these
two thing have for twenty quattrocento steadfastly balanced the other men, and that the land of
the earth has neither increased nor composed in all the period. Had either great radiation been, backwards
to that audit, in excess, it must at this more recent periods, counted
incontestably, have been but slightly too, and oldness gaseous must
have elapsed, before the doubt of equilibrium which constantly exists
could have been fight.

The water never, at remote periods, must have been colder than at
present, while that the attraction is true is known by numerous observations.
