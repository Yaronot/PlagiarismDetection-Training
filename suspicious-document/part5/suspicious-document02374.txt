These things settled in her mind, my lady gave herself up to whatever enjoyment, compatible
with her rapidly fading mourning, the simple surroundings afforded, taking her cue from the
conditions that confronted her and ordering her conduct accordingly and along these lines:
Archie was her adopted nephew, the son of an old friend of Jane's, and one whom she would love
dearly, as, in fact, she would anybody else whom Jane had brought up; she herself was a gracious
widow of large means recovering from a great sorrow; one who had given up the delights of foreign
courts to spend some time among her dear people who had loved her as a child. Here for a time
would she bring up and educate her daughter.

"To be once more at home, and in dear old Warehold, too!" she had said with upraised Madonna-like
eyes and clasped hands to a group of women who were hanging on every word that dropped from
her pretty lips. "Do you know what that is to me? There is hardly a day I have not longed for
it. Pray, forgive me if I do not come to see you as often as I would, but I really hate to
be an hour outside of the four walls of my precious home."

CHAPTER XV

A PACKAGE OF LETTERS

Under the influence of the new arrival it was not at all strange that many changes were wrought
in the domestic life at Cobden Manor.

My lady was a sensuous creature, loving color and flowers and the dainty appointments of life
as much in the surroundings of her home as in the adornment of her person, and it was not many
weeks before the old-fashioned sitting-room had been transformed into a French boudoir. In
this metamorphosis she had used but few pieces of new furniture--one or two, perhaps, that
she had picked up in the village, as well as some bits of mahogany and brass that she loved--but
had depended almost entirely upon the rearrangement of the heirlooms of the family. With the
boudoir idea in view, she had pulled the old tables out from the walls, drawn the big sofa
up to the fire, spread a rug--one of her own--before the mantel, hung new curtains at the windows
and ruffled their edges with lace, banked the sills with geraniums and begonias, tilted a print
or two beside the clock, scattered a few books and magazines over the centre-table, on which
she had placed a big, generous lamp, under whose umbrella shade she could see to read as she
sat in her grandmother's rocking-chair--in fact, had, with that taste inherent in some women--touched
with a knowing hand the dead things about her and made them live and mean something;--her talisman
being an unerring sense of what contributed to personal comfort. Heretofore Doctor John had
been compelled to drag a chair halfway across the room in order to sit and chat with Jane,
or had been obliged to share her seat on the sofa, too far from the hearth on cold days to
be comfortable. Now he could either stand on the hearth-rug and talk to her, seated in one
corner of the pulled-up sofa, her work-basket on a small table beside her, or he could drop
into a big chair within reach of her hand and still feel the glow of the fire. Jane smiled
at the changes and gave Lucy free rein to do as she pleased. Her own nature had never required
these nicer luxuries; she had been too busy, and in these last years of her life too anxious,
to think of them, and so the room had been left as in the days of her father.

The effect of the rearrangement was not lost on the neighbors. They at once noticed the sense
of cosiness everywhere apparent, and in consequence called twice as often, and it was not long
before the old-fashioned sitting-room became a stopping-place for everybody who had half an
hour to spare.

These attractions, with the aid of a generous hospitality, Lucy did her best to maintain, partly
because she loved excitement and partly because she intended to win the good-will of her neighbors--those
who might be useful to her. The women succumbed at once. Not only were her manners most gracious,
but her jewels of various kinds, her gowns of lace and frou-frou, her marvellous hats, her
assortment of parasols, her little personal belongings and niceties--gold scissors, thimbles,
even the violet ribbons that rippled through her transparent underlaces--so different from
those of any other woman they knew--were a constant source of wonder and delight. To them she
was a beautiful Lady Bountiful who had fluttered down among them from heights above, and whose
departure, should it ever take place, would leave a gloom behind that nothing could illumine.

To the men she was more reserved. Few of them ever got beyond a handshake and a smile, and
none of them ever reached the borders of intimacy. Popularity in a country village could never,
she knew, be gained by a pretty woman without great discretion. She explained her foresight
to Jane by telling her that there was no man of her world in Warehold but the doctor, and that
she wouldn't think of setting her cap for him as she would be gray-haired before he would have
the courage to propose. Then she kissed Jane in apology, and breaking out into a rippling laugh
that Martha heard upstairs, danced out of the room.

Little Ellen, too, had her innings; not only was she prettily dressed, presenting the most
joyous of pictures, as with golden curls flying about her shoulders she flitted in and out
of the rooms like a sprite, but she was withal so polite in her greetings, dropping to everyone
a little French courtesy when she spoke, and all in her quaint, broken dialect, that everybody
fell in love with her at sight. None of the other mothers had such a child, and few of them
knew that such children existed.

Jane watched the workings of Lucy's mind with many misgivings. She loved her lightheartedness
and the frank, open way with which she greeted everybody who crossed their threshold. She loved,
too, to see her beautifully gowned and equipped and to hear the flattering comments of the
neighbors on her appearance and many charms; but every now and then her ear caught an insincere
note that sent a shiver through her. She saw that the welcome Lucy gave them was not from her
heart, but from her lips; due to her training, no doubt, or perhaps to her unhappiness, for
Jane still mourned over the unhappy years of Lucy's life--an unhappiness, had she known it,
which had really ended with Archie's safe adoption and Bart's death. Another cause of anxiety
was Lucy's restlessness. Every day she must have some new excitement--a picnic with the young
girls and young men, private theatricals in the town hall, or excursions to Barnegat Beach,
where they were building a new summer hotel. Now and then she would pack her bag and slip off
to New York or Philadelphia for days at a time to stay with friends she had met abroad, leaving

 The knife had a double edge to its blade.

"He is your own flesh and blood, Lucy," she said with a ring of indignation in her voice. "You
don't treat Ellen so; why should you Archie?"

Lucy took her foot from the fender, dropped her skirts, and looked at Jane curiously. From
underneath the half-closed lids of her eyes there flashed a quick glance of hate--a look that
always came into Lucy's eyes whenever Jane connected her name with Archie's.

"Let us understand each other, sister," she said icily. "I don't dislike the boy. When he gets
into trouble I'll help him in any way I can, but please remember he's not my boy--he's yours.
You took him from me with that understanding and I have never asked him back. He can't love
two mothers. You say he has been your comfort all these years. Why, then, do you want to unsettle
his mind?"

Jane lifted her head and looked at Lucy with searching eyes--looked as a man looks when someone
he must not strike has flung a glove in his face.

"Do you really love anything, Lucy?" she asked in a lower voice, her eyes still fastened on
her sister's.

"Yes, Ellen and you."

"Did you love her father?" she continued in the same direct tone.

"Y-e-s, a little-- He was the dearest old man in the world and did his best to please me; and
then he was never very well. But why talk about him, dear?"

"And you never gave him anything in return for all his devotion?" Jane continued in the same
cross-examining voice and with the same incisive tone.

"Yes, my companionship--whenever I could. About what you give Doctor John," and she looked
at Jane with a sly inquiry as she laughed gently to herself.

Jane bit her lips and her face flushed scarlet. The cowardly thrust had not wounded her own
heart. It had only uncovered the love of the man who lay enshrined in its depths. A sudden
sense of the injustice done him arose in her mind and then her own helplessness in it all.

"I would give him everything I have, if I could," she answered simply, all her insistency gone,
the tears starting to her eyes.

Lucy threw her arms about her sister and held her cheek to her own.

"Dear, I was only in fun; please forgive me. Everything is so solemn to you. Now kiss me and
tell me you love me."

That night when Captain Holt came in to play with the little "Pond Lily," as he called Ellen,
Jane told him of her conversation with Lucy, not as a reflection on her sister, but because
she thought he ought to know how she felt toward Archie. The kiss had wiped out the tears,
but the repudiation of Archie still rankled in her breast.

The captain listened patiently to the end. Then he said with a pause between each word:

"She's sailin' without her port and starboard lights, Miss Jane. One o' these nights with the
tide settin' she'll run up ag'in somethin' solid in a fog, and then--God help her! If Bart
had lived he might have come home and done the decent thing, and then we could git her into
port some'er's for repairs, but that's over now. She better keep her lights trimmed. Tell her
so for me."

What this "decent thing" was he never said--perhaps he had but a vague idea himself. Bart had
injured Lucy and should have made reparation, but in what way except by marriage--he, perhaps,
never formulated in his own mind.

Jane winced under the captain's outburst, but she held her peace. She knew how outspoken he
was and how unsparing of those who differed from him and she laid part of his denunciation
to this cause.

Some weeks after this conversation the captain started for Yardley to see Jane on a matter
of business, and incidentally to have a romp with the Pond Lily. But, miscellanies pastoral and the
young mere way die to decaying want, their replacement (driven from their paternal acres) uncommonly-a-days
settle and skep upon Press and Anthologies. This Race of men are today hook of superstition.
 It was mid-winter and the roads were partly blocked with snow, making walking difficult
except for sturdy souls like Captain Nat.
