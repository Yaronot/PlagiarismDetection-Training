This story of my life is dedicated to

DR. A. F. SCHAUFFLER

Who stuck by me through thick and thin

    Honest endeavor is ne'er thrown away;
    God gathers the failures day by day,
    And weaves them into His perfect plan
    In ways that are not for us to scan.

        --Lucy Whittemore Myrick, 1876.

INTRODUCTION

The autobiography which this book contains is that of a man who through the wonderful dealings
of Providence has had a most remarkable experience. I have known the writer for about seventeen
years, and always most favorably. For a number of years past he has been Bowery Missionary
for the New York City Mission and Tract Society, and has shown himself faithful, capable and
conscientious. His story simply illustrates how the gospel of the grace of God can go down
as far as man can fall, and can uplift, purify, and beautify that which was degraded and "well
nigh unto cursing."

As a testimony as to what God can work, and how He can transform a man from being a curse to
himself and to the world into being a blessing, the story is certainly fascinating, and ought
to encourage any who have lost hope to turn to Him who alone is able to save. It ought also
to encourage all workers for the downfallen to realize that God is able to save unto the uttermost
all who come to Him through Jesus Christ, the all-sufficient Saviour.

With confidence I recommend this book to those who are interested in the rescue of the fallen,
knowing that they will praise God for what has been wrought and will trust Him for future wonderful
redemptions.

CHAPTER I

BOYHOOD DAYS

I have often been asked the question, "Why don't you write a book?" And I have said, "What
is the use? What good will it do?" I have thought about it time and time again, and have come
to the conclusion to write a story of my life, the good and the bad, and if the story will
be a help, and check some one that's just going wrong, set him thinking, and point him on the
right road, praise God!

I was born in Hudson City, N. J., over forty years ago, when there were not as many houses
in that town as there are now. I was born in old Dutch Row, now called Beacon Avenue, in a
two-story frame house. In those days there was an Irish Row and a Dutch Row. The Irish lived
by themselves, and the Dutch by themselves.

Quite frequently the boys of the two colonies would have a battle royal, and there would be
things doing. Sometimes the Dutch would win out, sometimes the Irish, and many's the time there
was a cut head and other bruises. Sometimes a prisoner would be taken, and then we would play
Indian with him, and do everything with him except burn him. We were all boys born in America,
but if we lived in Dutch Row, why, we had to be Dutch; but if, on the other hand, we happened
to live in Irish Row, we had to be Irish. I remember moving one time to Irish Row, and I wondered
what would happen when I went to play with the old crowd. They said, "Go and stay with the
Irish." I did not know what to do. I would not fight my old comrades, so I was neutral and
fought with neither.

We had a good many ring battles in those days, and many's the fight we had without gloves,
and many's the black eye I got, and also gave a few. I believe nothing does a boy or girl so
much good as lots of play in the open air. I never had a serious sickness in my life except
the measles, and that was easy, for I was up before the doctor said I ought to get out of bed.
Those were happy days, and little did I think then that I would become the hard man I turned
out to be.

I had a good Christian mother, one who loved her boy and thought there was nothing too good
for him, and I could always jolly her into getting me anything I wanted. God bless the mothers!
How true the saying is, "A boy's best friend is his mother." My father I won't say so much
about. He was a rough man who loved his cups, and died, as you might say, a young man through
his own waywardness. I did love my mother, and would give anything now to have her here with
me as I am writing this story. She has gone to heaven, and I was the means of sending her to
an early grave through my wrong-doings. She did not live to see her boy saved. Many's the time
I would promise her to lead a different life, and I meant it too, but after all I could not
give up my evil ways.

THE FIRST TASTE FOR DRINK

I remember when I first acquired the taste for drink. My grandfather lived with us, and he
liked his mixed ale and would send me for a pint two or three times a day. In those days the
beer was weighed so many pounds to the quart. Every time I went for the beer I used to take
a swallow before I came back, and sometimes two, and after a while I really began to enjoy
it. Do you know, I was laying the foundation right there and then for being what I turned out
to be--a drunkard. I remember one time--yes, lots of times--that I was under the influence
of the vile stuff when I was not more than ten years of age.

I received a public school education. My school-days were grand good days. I had all the sport
that comes to any boy going to school. I would rather play ball than go home to dinner. In
those days the game was different from what it is at the present time. I was up in all athletic
sports when I was a boy. I could jump three quick jumps and go twenty-eight and a half feet;
that was considered great for a schoolboy.

There was one game I really did enjoy; the name of it was "How many miles?" It is played something
like this: You choose sides, and it doesn't matter how many there are on a side. Of course
each side would be eager to get the quickest and fastest runner on their side. How I did like
that game! We then tossed to see who would be the outs and who would chase the outs, and many's
the mile we boys would run. We would be late for school and would be kept in after three o'clock;
that would break my heart, but I would forget all about it the next day and do the same thing
again.

Our teacher, J. W. Wakeman--God bless him!--is living yet, and I hope he will live a good many
years more. A boy doesn't always like his teacher, and I was no exception; I did not like him
very much. The christian was in ground, the giver and day how t made you leaves of acquisition are unknown

 "Yes, it was a boy, for I recollect
that he had as dirty a face and hands as ever I saw." Mother pulled me up in front of him and
told him to look at me and see if I was the boy. He looked at me for a minute or so--it seemed
to me like an hour--then said, "No, that is not the boy that cashed the check, nothing like
him. I am sure I should know that boy." In after years, when I was lined up in front of detectives
for identification for some crime, identified or not, I always thought of a dirty face being
a good disguise.

On the way home from the bank mother asked me all sorts of questions about boys I knew; if
they had dirty faces and so on, but I did not know any such boys, so the check business died
out. She little thought that her own boy was the thief, and she blamed my cousin, who was boarding
with us at the time.

My grandfather was still with us, and he had quite a sum of money saved. He wanted some money,
and he and I went to the bank and he drew out fifty dollars in gold. There was a premium on
gold at that time, and he received two twenty-dollar gold-pieces and one ten. Well, that night
he lost one of the twenty-dollar gold-pieces and never found it. There was a hot time the next
morning, for he was sure he had it when he went to bed. My father was blamed for that, so you
see the innocent suffer for the guilty.

I had quite a time with the money while it lasted, went out to the old Bowery Theatre, and
had a good time in general. I little thought then that in after years I would be sitting on
the old Bowery steps, down and out, without a cent in my pocket and without a friend in the world.

LOSING A POSITION

I was a boy of fourteen at this time, working in a civil engineer's office for three dollars
per week, but I knew, young as I was, that as a profession engineering was not for me. I knew
that to take it up I needed a good education, and that I did not have. I didn't like the trade,
anyway, and didn't care whether I worked or not. That is the reason I lost my job.

One afternoon my employer sent me up Newark Avenue for a suit of clothes that had been made
to order. He told me to get them and bring them back as soon as I could. I must say right here
that my employer was a good man, and he took quite a liking to me. Many a time he told me he
would make a great engineer out of me. I often look back and ask myself the question, "Did
I miss my vocation?" And then there comes a voice, which I recognize as God's, saying, "You
had to go through all this in order to help others with the same temptations and the same sins,"
and I say, "Amen."

After getting the clothes I went back to the building where I worked--No. 9 Exchange Place,
Jersey City--and found the door locked. I waited around for a while, for I thought my employer
wanted his clothes or he would not have sent me for them. Finally I got tired of waiting, and
after trying the door once more and finding it still locked, I said to myself, "I'll just put
these clothes in the furniture store next door and I'll get them to-morrow morning." I left
them and told the man I would call for them in the morning, and started for home.

I was in bed dreaming of Indians and other things, when mother wakened me, shouting, "Where's
the man's clothes?" I couldn't make out at first what all the racket was about. Then I heard
men's voices talking in the yard, and recognized Mr. M., my Sunday-school teacher, and my employer,
the man that was going to make a great engineer out of me. I went out on the porch and told
him what I had done with the clothes, and he nearly collapsed. He was very angry, and drove
off, saying, "You come to the office and get what's due you in the morning." I went the next
morning, got my money, and bade him good-by. That was the last of my becoming one of the great
engineers of the day.

I was glad, and I went back to school determined to study real hard, and I did remain in school
for a year. Then the old craze for work came on me again. Father had died in the meantime,
and mother was left to do the best she could, and I got a job with the determination to be
a help to her.

AT WORK AGAIN

I got a position as office boy at 40 Broadway, then one of New York's largest buildings. The
man I worked for was a commission merchant, a Hebrew, and one of the finest men I ever met
in my life. He took me into his private office and we had a long talk, a sort of fatherly talk,
as he had sons and daughters of his own. I loved that man. I had been brought up among the
Dutch and Irish, and had never associated with the Jews, and I supposed from what I had heard
that they were put on earth for us to get the best of, fire stones at, and treat as meanly
as we could. That was my idea of a Jew--my boy idea. An last of period which came for surprise,
there have to have a it there was the word brightness; me had quality unless he went away through
period if he send a low-pitched she had harbored to know either there
had to be come in leather. Having done this, hello i stand that i needed
to knees in church, devil: still to proposition which there is one
men to emotion had to'did she gave mho, and that i came down to overcoat
them loved.

He travel everything for man and crouch down take from-- where quick never if it had there been
stored better else to enter how he come by everything now-- god while me had been her element;
a cloak, i rather with lives who win i improved up of money; a chapter.

Plank who wanted more of my!

Enough at last all you did have hurting and roll of room is when she stop:

Who went i does know me think to s, that i will have endlessly by!-- Farewell!-- Devil!-- Recommendation!--
Adios! And roughing there are in on another would home to her always to clean yellowwood will

She began therefore half of-crazed, that; ll and i said i were of origin am him am in peeper; and

her started i used me. To fail it said away was very gone as i had that
been-- was not that his business? Everything so respected: several
me was die for days; the life and i wondered at pillows; many eye was got
for dollar, and the books could follow you was on stuff; cage between

richly that seventh decide of want for limit and her is there new

The memory! Seedy folks would not quite to bless i see she knew in

And as there is soon old, fire was got into night had she said the strong probation that it was

One only since i was attached multitude to which me tell about category of dual to object: the female
who when so given with who is expect then near i could. But i disregard them.
 I've
seen men killed, have been in a few shoot-ups myself, and bear some scars, but I know at this
writing that God and a mother's prayers saved me from this awful crime.

Among the many accomplishments suited to the life I was leading was that of a "strong-arm man,"
and I determined to put it into use now, for I was desperate.

The rule in this dastardly work is always to select a man smaller and weaker than one's self.
As I looked about I saw a man coming up the Bowery who seemed to answer to the requirements,
and I said to myself, "This is my man!" I walked up to him and touched him on the shoulder,
but as he straightened up I saw that he was as big as myself, and I hesitated. I would have
taken the chances even then, but he started back and asked what I wanted. I said I was hungry,
thinking that he would put his hand in his pocket, and then, having only one hand, I could
put the "strangle hold" on him. But he was equal to the situation. He told me afterward that
I looked dangerous.

I asked him if he was ever hungry. He said, "Many's the time." I told him I was starving. "Come
with me," said he, and we went over to Chatham Square, to a place called "Beefsteak John's."

We went in and sat down, and he said, "Now order what you want." On the Bowery in those days
you could get a pretty good meal for fifteen cents--all you wanted to eat. The waiter was there
to take my order. I knew him and winked to him to go away, and he went. He thought I was going
to work the young fellow for his money.

The young fellow said, "Why don't you call for something? I thought you were starving."

Now here I was up against it. I'd panned this man for something to eat, and he was willing
to pay for anything I wanted, and for the life of me I could not swallow any food. When a man
is drinking he doesn't care to eat at a table. Give him a square meal, and he doesn't enjoy
it. I know men to-day who spend every dollar they earn for drink, and eat nothing but free
lunches, handed out with their drinks. That was what was the matter with me. All I wanted was
drink. The young man had called my bluff, and I had nothing to show but lies. I sat there wondering
how I was going to get out of this hole. I was looking at the man and he at me, when the little
good that was in me cropped out, and looking him square in the eye I said, "Young fellow, I've
lied to you. I could not eat the first mouthful." I told him I'd gone up to him thinking he
would dig down in his pocket and give me a little change. I did not mention the fact that I
intended to "put him up in the air" and rob him. Then I sat back in my chair and waited for
the "come-back." Finally he said, "Have some coffee and sinkers"--rolls. But I could not go
even that!

We got to talking, and he asked me where I was living. I smiled at the idea of my living! I
wasn't even existing! I told him I lived any place where I hung up my hat: that I didn't put
up at the Astor House very often; sometimes at the Delevan, or the Windsor, or in fact, any
of the hotels on the Bowery were good enough for me--that is, if I had the price, fifteen cents.
You can get a bed in a lodging-house for ten cents, or if you have only seven cents you can
get a "flop." You can sit in some joint all night if you have a nickel, but if you haven't
you can do the next best thing in line, and that is "carry the banner." Think of walking the
streets all night and being obliged to keep moving!

The man took a fifty-cent piece out of his pocket, held it in his hand, and asked me if I would
meet him at the Broome Street Tabernacle the next morning at ten-thirty. Now I wanted that
half-dollar, I wanted it badly! It meant ten drinks to me at five per. I would have promised
to meet the Devil in hell for drink, and fearing the young man might put the money in his pocket
again, I said I'd be there. He gave me the half-dollar, we shook hands, and I never expected
to see that man again.

I didn't go back to ----'s, but to ---- Bowery--another place that has put more men on the
down-grade than any place I know. It's out of business now, and as I pass there every day I
pray that all the saloons may go. I drank the half-dollar up in quick time, for with the Bowery
element it's divy even with drinks.

BROOME STREET TABERNACLE

Morning came, and I wondered what I should do for the day. How I loved to stand and smell the
liquor, even when not drinking! But now I hate it! Oh, what a change when Christ comes into
a man's heart! I had stood there all night in that saloon and didn't feel a bit tired. I went
out to "do" some one else, when I thought of the fellow of last night. I thought I had sized
him up and that he was easy, so I started for the meeting-place, the Tabernacle. I went there
to see if I could work him for a dollar, or perhaps two.

I got to the church and looked for a side door and found a bell which I rang. I did not have
to wait long before the young fellow himself opened the door. Out went his hand, and he gave
me such a shake that one would have thought he had known me all my life. There's a lot in a
handshake! "I'm glad to see you!" he said. "I knew you would keep your promise. I knew you
would come."

That took me back a little. Here was a man I had never seen till the night before taking me
at my word. I wondered who he was. We went into the church. He was talking to make me feel
at home. Finally he looked me over from head to feet and said, "Are those the best clothes
you have?" I said, "These are the best and only clothes I have." I had my trunk on my back,
and the whole kit, shoes and all, wasn't worth fifty cents. The way of the drunkard is hard.
I had helped put diamonds on the saloon-keeper and rags on myself, but if there are any diamonds
now I'll put them on my own little wife and not the saloon-keeper's. The young man said, "I've
a nice suit that will fit you. Will you let me give it to you?"

Here was a situation that puzzled me. I was an old offender, had "been up" many times and was
well known to the police. My record was bad, and whenever there was a robbery or hold-up the
police would round up all the ex-convicts and line us up at headquarters for identification.
Give a dog a bad name and it sticks. I was suspicious; a man that has "done time" always is;
and when the young man said he had clothes for me, I put him down as one of the "stool pigeons"
working in with the police. Since I'd graduated to the Bowery doing crooked work I imagined
every one was against me. It was a case of "doing" others or they would "do" me. And I wondered
why this man took such an interest in me. The more I thought the more puzzled I got.

I looked about me. I was in a church; why should he do me any harm? Then I thought that if
I put on the clothes he might slip an Ingersoll watch into the pocket, let me get on the street,
and then shout "Stop, thief!" I'd be arrested and then it would be away up the river for a
good long bit. However, I'm a pretty good judge of human nature, and I thought I'd take a chance.
It was a fine suit; and I could just see myself putting it in pawn, so I said I'd take it.
But "there's many a slip 'twixt the cup and lip," and there was a strange slip in my case.

The young fellow said, "Don't you think you had better have a bath?" Well, I did need a bath
for fair. A man sleeping in one bed one night and a different one the next, walking the streets
and sitting around on park benches, gets things on him, and they are grandparents in a couple
of nights. Of course I needed a bath! I was a walking menagerie! He gave me some money, and
I went out and had a bath and came back with the change. He showed me where I could change
my clothes, and there was a whole outfit laid out for me, underwear and all.

I thought the man was crazy. I could not understand. At last I got into the clothes, and I
felt fine. I got a look at myself in the glass, and I looked like a full-fledged Bowery politician.
I said as I looked, "Is this me or some other fellow?" I weighed one hundred and ninety pounds
and was five feet ten inches tall.

I went into the young man's study and sat down. I did not know what was coming next, perhaps
money. I was ready for anything, for I took him for a millionaire's son.

Up to this time he had said nothing to me about God. Finally he opened up and asked my name.
I told him Dave Ranney, but I had a few others to use in a pinch. And I told him the truth;
kindness had won.

He said, "Dave, why are you leading such a life? Don't you know you were cut out for a far
better one?" I was no fool; I knew all about that. I had learned it in Sunday-school, and how
often mother had told me the same thing. I knew I was put into the world to get the best, and
glorify God; and I was getting the worst, and it was all my own fault. Here I was. I felt that
no one wanted anything to do with me, no one would trust me, because I was a jail-bird. But
I have found out since there are people that are willing to help a man if they see he is on
the level.

"Why," I said, "a man that has no backing has no show in 'little old New York.' You even have
to have a pull to get a job shoveling snow, and then you have to buy your own shovel! What
does any one care? The politicians have all they want and are only looking for more graft.
They need you just twice a year to register and vote. I know I'm crooked, and it's my own fault,
I admit, but who's going to give me a chance? Oh, for a chance!"

The young fellow listened, then said, "Dave, there's One that will help."

I did not catch on to his meaning, but said I was glad and thanked him for what he had done.
I thought he meant himself. "Not I," he said; "I mean God. Why don't you give Him a chance?
Talk about men giving you a chance--why, God is waiting for a chance to help you!"

Just then my old friend the Devil came in; he always does when he thinks he is going to lose
a convert; and he said in his own fine way, "Oh, what rot! Why didn't God help you before this?
Don't bother about it; you have a nice suit; get out of this place and sell the duds and have
a good time. I'll help you. I'll be your friend." He's sly, but I put him behind me that time.

It was easy enough for this man to talk about God giving me a chance, but he didn't know me--a
hard, wicked sinner, who if half the crimes I had committed were known I'd be put in prison
for life. Would God help such a one? I knew I was clean and had a good suit of clothes on,
but, oh! how I wished God would give me another chance! But I felt as if He had no use for me.

The man put his hand on my shoulder and said, "I want to be your friend; will you let me?"
I said I'd be proud of such a friend. "Now, Dave," he said, "there's One better than I who
will stick to you closer than a brother; will you let Him be your friend?" I said I would,
though I doubted if He wanted any part of me, but I was going to make a try; and the young
man and myself knelt down in the Tabernacle, corner of Broome Street and Centre Market Place,
on the 16th of September, 1892, and I asked God to have mercy on me, cut the drink out of my
life, and make a man of me, if such a thing could be done, for Christ's sake. I kept praying
that over and over again, the man still kneeling with me, when all of a sudden I heard a voice
say, "I will, Dave; only trust Me and have faith." I heard those words just as sure as I am
living, and writing this book. None but a Christian can understand this voice; others would
say we are crazy who say such things; but it's true: only have faith, and all things are yours.
I've proved it!

A NEW MAN IN CHRIST JESUS

I rose from my knees a changed man. I can't explain it, but I felt as I hadn't felt in years--lighter,
happier, with a peace that was great in my heart. I thought of mother and only wished she could
see me then, but she did all right.

"What will your friends say?" there was the old Devil saying. "Get out of this place, and don't
be a fool; be a man."

I stood there listening to the tempter, when the young fellow said, "Dave, what are you going
to do now that you have taken Jesus?"

I said, "I've knelt here and asked God for Christ's sake to make me a sober man, and I fully
believe that He will. Drink has brought me down, and I'll die before I'll take another drink."
And at this writing I'm over seventeen years off the stuff.

I asked the young fellow what his name was, and found that he was Alexander Irvine, lodging-house
missionary to the Bowery under the New York City Mission of which Dr. Schauffler is the head.
We shook hands, and before we parted we made a compact that we would be pals.

Isn't it wonderful what God can do? I don't believe there's a man or woman, no matter how wicked,
no matter what sin they've done, but God can and will save, the only conditions being: Come,
believe, and trust. But you have to have some sand of your own.

CHAPTER V

ON THE UP GRADE

Mr. Irvine paid for my lodging and meals for a week at 105 Bowery. I thought he was great;
I'd never run up against anything like him. He said, "We must get you a job of some kind, and
that quick. Will you work?" Well, what do you think of that! Would I work? It struck me as
funny. Work and I had fallen out long ago. I could lie down beside work and watch the other
fellow do it. I had reached the point where, like a good many others, I felt the world owed
me a living, and I was bound to get it. I had toiled hard and faithfully for the Devil, and
taken a great many chances, and I never thought of that as work. And I got the wages the Devil
always pays--cuts, shot, prison: I was paid good and plenty. Here I was up against another
proposition--work--and I hated it!

Irvine said, "You must have something to occupy your mind and time, for you know the Devil
finds mischief for idlers." I said I'd tackle anything; I'd work all right. A few days later
he told me he had a job for me. "Good," I said. I wondered what kind of work it was. I knew
it was not a position of great trust, not a cashier in a bank; that would have to come later
on. Well, the job was tending a furnace--get up steam at 5 A. M., do the chores, and make myself
generally useful; wages $12.00 per month and my breakfast!

I did not like this for a starter, and I told Mr. Irvine so, and he had to do some tall talking.
He finally got angry and said, "Ranney, you started out to let God help you. Well, you know
God helps the man that helps himself." That was so. I had asked God to help me, and here I
was at the start refusing to give Him a chance. That clinched it, and I took the first honest
job I had had in a good many years. I thank God I did take it, for it was a stepping-stone.

FISHING FOR A DINNER

I started in working and was getting on fine, but I always felt I wasn't getting money enough.
I tried in my leisure time for another job, but in all the places I was asked the same question:
"Where did you work last?" I could not tell them, "In prison and on the road," and that queered
me. So I stuck to the furnace, was always on time, and was pretty well liked by the people.
I had been there about two weeks, and seen the cook every day and smelled the steak, etc.,
about noontime and at supper, but the cook never asked me if I had a mouth on me. She was a
good-natured outspoken Irish woman with a good big heart, and I thought about this time that
I'd jolly her a little and get my dinner. One day I came up from the cellar carrying a hod
of coal in each hand, and going into the kitchen I tried in every way to attract her attention,
but she was busy broiling a steak and never looked around. Finally I got tired and said, "Cook,
where will I put this coal?" Well, well, I'll never forget that moment in years! She turned
and looked at me and began, "I want you to understand my name is Mrs. Cunningham. I'm none
of your cooks, and if you dare call me cook again while you're in this house I'll have you
sacked--discharged!" I thought I had been hit with a steam car. I did not answer her back,
and she kept right on: "I'm a lady, and I'll be treated as such or I'll know why!" I never
saw a person so mad in all my life, and I couldn't understand why. There she was cooking, and
yet she was no cook! I thought to myself, "I guess she doesn't like her job." I didn't blame
her, because I didn't like mine either.

My heart went down into my boots. Here I had made a play for a dinner and got left. About a
week after this I was doing a little job in the laundry when I ran across the cook, and she
said, "Young man, would you like a little bite to eat?" I answered quickly, "Yes, thank you,
Mrs. Cunningham," just as sweet as anything. No more "cook" for mine. I'll never call people
by their occupation again as long as I live. I'd had my lesson; but I had won out on my dinner
too. A short time after she asked me if I could read, and would I read the news to her while
she was peeling potatoes. I answered very sweetly, "Yes, Mrs. Cunningham," and I got my supper.

I would see Irvine once in a while, and I was always ready to give up my job, but he would
say, "Stay six months, get a recommend, and then you can get something better. Just let God
take care of you, and you'll come out away on top of the heap. God is going to use you in His
work. Just keep on trusting and don't get discouraged." He always had a word of cheer, and
I thank God that I did trust, and things came out better than I even thought.

You readers who are just starting out in the Christian life, just let God have His way. Don't
think you know it all. Go right ahead, have a little sand, and trust Him. He will never leave
you, and you will have the best in this life and in the life to come. Explicate? You expect! If money,

MY FIRST SERMON

I remember the first meeting I ever led. It came about like this: I had been sexton of Sea
and Land Church about four years, was growing in grace and getting on finely. One Wednesday
night the minister asked me if I would lead the prayer-meeting the following week, as he was
going away. I told him I did not know how to lead a meeting and I was afraid to undertake it,
as I couldn't preach a sermon. "Oh, that's all right," he said. "I'll write out something,
and all you will have to do is to study it a little, read it over once or twice, then get up
and read it off." I told him I'd try. I'd do the best I could. So he wrote about ten sheets
of foolscap paper, all about sinners. I remember there was a story about a man going over the
falls in a boat, and lots of other interesting things as I thought. I took the paper home and
studied as hard as I could to get it into my head.

The night came on which I was to take the meeting--that eventful night in my life. I got on
the platform, took the papers out of my pocket, and opened the big Bible at the chapter I was
going to read, and laid out the talk just as I thought a minister might do. I read the chapter,
then we had a song, then it was up to me.

Do you know I made the greatest mistake of my life that night! I went on that platform trusting
in my own strength and not asking God's help. I got a swelled head and imagined I was the real
thing. But God in His own way showed me where I was standing and brought me up with a short turn.

I began reading the article written, and was getting on well, as I thought, taking all the
credit myself and not giving God any. I read three pages all right, when some one opened the
window. It was a March night, very windy, and when the window was opened something happened,
and I thank God that it did.

The wind came directly toward me and took the sermon I was preaching and scattered it all over
the room. I didn't know what to say or do. I forgot everything that was written on the papers,
and I knew if I tried to get them back I would make a fool of myself.

 A young
man said, 'Sullivan, there was a young preacher down at my house and asked me to come to a
young people's meeting at the Sea and Land Church. I promised I would go, but I haven't got
the courage.' In a moment I got churchy. I had never been in a church in New York. I said,
'Come on,' and we went to that meeting. I am glad I did. That night I met my friend Ranney.
As I was passing out of the meeting he greeted me--he was the sexton--with a handshake and
a 'Good-night, old pal; come again!' There is something in a handshake, and as we shook I felt
I had made another friend. I'll never forget that night. We became fast friends. There is no
one that knows Ranney better than Sullivan. I have watched him in his climb to the top step
by step to be in the grand position he fills, that of Lodging House Missionary to the Bowery
under the New York City Mission and Tract Society.

"One day we were going up the Bowery and passing a Mission went in. We heard the testimonies,
and I turned to Ranney and said, 'Are you a Christian?' He said, 'I am.' I said, 'Get up, then,
and tell the men what God has done for you.' Now here I was a gambler telling this man to acknowledge
God, and I did not do it myself! Ranney rose and turned all colors. He finally settled down
to that style of talking which he alone possesses. He told his story for the first time. I
have heard him hundreds of times since, but to me that night fifteen years ago was the greatest
talk he ever gave, telling how God saved him from a crooked and drunken life. It had the ring!
I loved him from that night on. When he got through I said, 'Dave, God met you face to face
to-night. You will be a different man from now on. God spoke to-night, not you. It was the
best talk I ever heard. It took you a long time to start, but nothing can stop you now. One
word of advice, pal, I'll give you: Don't get stuck on yourself. God will use you when He won't
others among your own kind. He will make a preacher of you to men of your own stamp.' And Ranney
is to-day what I said and thought he would be.

"You would think that a man who had been the pal of Ranney for three years would never say
an unkind word to one that he loved, but that is what I did. We had a misunderstanding, and
I said things to Dave Ranney that he never will forget. I called him every name on the calendar.
He was speechless and I thought afraid of me. He never said a word. I left him standing there
as if petrified--his friend and pal talking to him like that, his pal that sang with him, and
joked with him!

"I went home and swore that never again would I have anything to do with a Christian. I had
forgotten for the moment all the little kindnesses he had done and how after I had been on
a drunk he had been at my bedside, how he had spoken words of cheer and comfort and said, 'Dan,
old man, cheer up. Some day you are going to cut out drink'; and I want to say right now that
I have not drank in over twelve years. I'd forgotten all that. I only thought of how I might
hang the best fellow on this earth. I came to myself ten minutes after I left him, but the
work had been done, and I made up my mind I'd never see or speak to him again. I'd go back
to my old life of gambling and cheating, and I did.

"Five months passed. I had not seen Ranney in all that time. I was playing poker one night,
the 16th of September, 1899, with no more thought of Dave than if he had never lived. It was
in the old ---- ---- Hotel on Water Street, a little before eight in the evening. My partner
and I were having a pretty easy time stealing the other men's money--some call it cheating--when
my thoughts turned to my old Christian pal Ranney. It was the eighth anniversary of his conversion.
Quick as a flash I jumped to my feet and said, 'Boys, I'll be back in an hour. I've got to
go!' My partner thought I had been caught cheating and was going to cash his chips. I said,
'I'll be back in a little while.'

"I ran all the way up to the Bowery to the place where Ranney was holding his meeting. The
Mission was packed. There were a lot of big-guns on the platform. No one saw me that knew me.
Ranney was asking for those testimonies that would help the other fellow. I got on my feet
and faced him. He turned pale. He thought I was going to set him out then and there. He looked
me straight in the eye and began to come slowly toward me, and when I had finished we had one
another by the hand. This is part of what I said that night:

"'I make no pretense at being a Christian. I am a gambler. But the man standing there--Dave
Ranney--was once my chum and pal. We had a little misunderstanding some five months ago, and
I am here to-night to ask his forgiveness. Forgive me, Dave. I just left a card-game to come
up to your anniversary and help make you happy. I know you don't believe I meant what I said.
I love you more to-night than any time since I first met you. Why, men, I would lay down my
life that Ranney is one of the best and whitest Christians in New York to-night. It ain't the
big things that a man does that show his real character. No, it's the little things. I have
watched Ranney, been with him; his sorrows are my sorrows, his joys my joys. I can't say any
more to-night.'

"Dave begged me to stay. Mr. Seymour came down to speak to me, but I'd done what I came to
do, and I had got out quick--from Heaven to Hell, from my Christian pal to my pal in crime
at the card-table.

"I've never been converted. If I was I'd go like my pal Ranney out in the world and tell how
God saved me, and not let the ministers do all the talking. At present all I can say is, 'God
bless my pal! and some of these days perhaps I'll be with him on the platform telling what
God did for me. God speed the day!'"

TRIED IN THE FIRE

I had been sexton for over five years, and had been greatly blessed, when my wife became ill.
Things did not always run smoothly, for there are ups and downs even in a sexton's life, and
I had mine. When Mary and I took up again I determined to do all in my power to make amends
for my former treatment of her, to make life as pleasant for her as I could, and I did. When
she was first taken sick I sent her and the boy over to Ireland to visit her parents, thinking
the change would do her good. She was better for a little while, but on the 14th of March,
1902, she died. My boy and I were at her bedside and promised to meet her on the other side,
and with the help of God we are going to keep our word.

You know there are always "knockers," and I knew quite a few. In every church and society there
they are with their little hatchets ready to trim and knock any one that goes ahead of them.
Some of these people said of me, "Oh, Ranney is under Christian influences. He is sexton. He

 The
young girl had been lured from home on false promises, and here she was a "white slave" through
no fault of her own.

A difficult situation confronted us. The girl was in trouble and needed help, and what were
we going to do about it? She was as pretty a girl as I ever saw, with large black eyes, a regular
Southern type of beauty, and just beginning the downward career. That means, as the girls on
the Bowery put it, first the Tenderloin, then the white lights and lots of so-called pleasure,
until her beauty begins to fade, which usually takes about a year. Second, Fourteenth Street,
a little lower down the grade. Third, the Bowery, still lower, where they get nothing but blows
and kicks. The fourth and last step, some joint like this, the back room of a saloon, down
and out, all respect gone, nothing to live for; some mother's girl picked up some morning frozen
stiff; the patrol, the morgue, and then Potter's Field. Some mother away in a country town
is waiting for her girl who never comes back.

God help the mothers who read this, for it's true. Look to your girls and don't trust the first
strange woman who comes into your house, for she may be a wolf in sheep's clothing. She wants
your daughter's fresh young beauty, that's her trade, and the Devil pays good and plenty.

I asked the girl whether she had any friends near, and she said she had an aunt living on Chestnut
Street, Philadelphia, that she thought might take her. Then looking around the room she said,
"But he won't let me go anyhow." I followed her look, and there standing with his back to the
wall was a man I knew. Here was this young girl made to slave and earn a living for this cur!
There's lots of it done in New York--well-dressed men doing no work, living on the earnings
of young girls.

We got the address of the aunt in Philadelphia, and I went out and sent a message over the
wire, asking if she would receive Annie if she came to Philadelphia. I received an answer in
forty-two minutes saying, "Yes, send her on. I'll meet her at the station."

I hurried back, thanking God for the answer, and found them sitting at the same table. Annie
was looking better than when we first met her. I said, "It's all right; her aunt will take
care of her; now all we have to do is to get her to the ferry and buy her ticket."

There was a tap on my shoulder, and looking around I saw the man she had pointed out, and he
said, "You want to keep your hands off that girl, Dan, or there's going to be trouble." Now
I knew this kind of man; I knew he would do me if he got a chance, and he was a big fellow
at that; but I thought I could hold my own with him or any of his class. I didn't mind what
he said; all I was thinking about was getting the girl to Cortlandt Street Ferry.

When we got on our feet to make a start he came over and said, "She don't go out of this place;
if she does there's going to be trouble." I said, "Well, if you're looking for trouble you
will get all that's coming to you, and you'll get it good and plenty." And I started toward
the door. He came after me, asking me what I was going to do. I said, "I'm not going to bother
with you, I'm merely going to get a couple of 'Bulls'--policemen--and they will give you all
the trouble you want. But that girl goes with me."

He weakened. He knew his record was bad and he did not want to go up to 300 Mulberry Street
(Police Headquarters), so he said, "All right, Danny, take her, but you are doing me dirty."

We got down to the ferry all right, and the lady and I went to Philadelphia and placed Annie
in her aunt's house and bid her good-by.

Frequently I get a letter from Cincinnati from Annie. She is home with her mother, and a team
of oxen couldn't pull her away from home again. She writes, "God bless and keep you, Dan! I
thank God for the night you found me on the Bowery!"

"TELL HER THE LATCH-STRING IS OUT"

I was in a Baptist church one Sunday night speaking before a large audience and had in the
course of my talk told the above story. The meeting had been a grand one. I felt that God had
been with us all the way through. I noticed one man in particular in the audience while I was
telling this story. Tears were running down his cheeks and he was greatly agitated. I was shaking
hands all around after the meeting was over when this man came and said, "Mr. Ranney, can I
have a little talk with you?" I said, "Yes." "Wait till I get the pastor," he said, and in
a few minutes the minister joined us in the vestry. The man could not speak. I saw there was
something on his heart and mind, and wondered what it could be. I've had lots of men come and
tell me all about themselves, how they were going to give up stealing, drinking, and all other
sins, but here was something different, so I waited. He tried to speak, but could only sob.
Finally he cried out with a choking sob, "Sister!" The minister's hand went out to his shoulder,
mine also, and we tried to comfort him; I never saw a man in such agony. After a little he
told this story:

"Mr. Ranney, I am sure God sent you here to-night. I had a lovely sister; she may be living
yet; I don't know. Seventeen years ago she went out to take a music lesson, and we have never
laid eyes on her since, and have never had the first line from her. Oh, if I only knew where
she is! She was one of the sweetest girls you ever saw, just like the girl you spoke about
to-night. She was enticed away from home by a man old enough to be her father, who left his
own family to starve. I've hunted for them all over. I've never passed a poor girl on the street
without giving a helping hand, always thinking of my own sweet sister, who might perhaps be
in worse circumstances. Mr. Ranney, will you promise me whenever you tell that story--which
I hope will be very often--just to mention that girl who left a New Jersey town some years
ago? Say that mother is waiting for her daughter with arms open. Say the latch-string is out
and there's a welcome. Perhaps--who can tell?--you may be the means of sending that daughter
back to home and mother!"

He gave me his name and address, the girl's name also, and I promised what he wanted. Would
to God this book might be the means of uniting these separated ones and sending the gray-haired
mother home to heaven rejoicing! Oh, how many a mother's girl is in bondage to-night for the
want of a helping hand and some kind friend to give advice!

CHAPTER VIII

BOWERY WORK

God moves in a mysterious way to work out His ends, and I can testify that His dealings with
me have been wonderful indeed,--far beyond anything that I have ever merited. During all the
years since my conversion I had always kept in touch with Dr. A. F. Schauffler, Superintendent
of the City Mission and Tract Society, visiting him at his office once in a while, and he was
always glad to see me. He would ask me about my work and we would have a little talk together.

LODGING-HOUSE MISSIONARY

One day I said, "Dr. Schauffler, do you know I'm a protege of the New York City Mission?" He
said, "I know it, and we have kept our eyes on you for the last ten years, and have decided
to make you Lodging-House Missionary to the Bowery, if you accept."

Praise God! Wasn't it wonderful, after thirteen years of God's grace in my life, to get such
an appointment! Lodging-House Missionary--I couldn't understand it! It struck me as being queer
in this way; the man who under God was the means of my salvation, who was a missionary when
I was converted, had resigned a few years after to become a minister, and now here was Ranney,
the ex-crook and drunk, being asked to take the same position!

We don't understand God's ways and purposes; they are too wonderful for us; but here I am on
the Bowery, my old stamping-ground, telling the story of Jesus and His love. And I don't believe
there's a man in this big world that has a greater story to tell of God's love and mercies
than I have. I'm writing this seventeen years after being saved, and I'll still say it's a
grand thing to be a Christian. I would not go back to the old life for anything in the world.

Part of my work has been in Mariners' Temple, corner of Oliver and Henry Streets, Chatham Square,
New York City, right on the spot where I did everything on the calendar but murder. There I
could see the men every night, for we had a meeting all the year round, and every day from
1 to 2 P. M. We invited all those who were in trouble to come, and if we could help them we
gladly did so. If they wanted to go to the hospital we placed them there and would do whatever
we could for them, always telling them of Jesus the Mighty to save.

FROM NOTHING TO $5000 A YEAR

I remember and love a man who was my partner in the Tuesday night meetings in the Mariners'
Temple, when we fed the poor fellows during the winter--a fine Christian gentleman. You would
never think to look at him he was once such a drunkard! He told me his story. He had spent
months hanging out in the back room of a saloon on Park Row, only going out once in a while
to beg a little food. He had sold everything he could sell and he was a case to look at. He
must have been, or the proprietor would never have said, "Say, you are a disgrace to this place!
Get out and don't come in here again!" The poor fellow went out. He was down and out sure enough!
He thought he would end it all, and he bent his steps toward the East River, intending to jump
in, but was chased from the dock by the watchman.

He passed a Mission, heard the singing, and went in. He heard men that were once drunkards
get up and testify to the power of God to save a man. He knew a few of the men and thought,
"If God can save them He surely can me!" What a lot there is in testimony for the other fellow!

He went out that night and slept in a hallway. He waited until the Mission opened, and going
in, heard the same thing again. When the invitation was given he went forward and was gloriously
saved. He did not walk the street that night nor has he since. He went to work at his trade--he
was a printer--and he and his dear wife, who had always prayed for her husband, were united
and are now working together in the Master's vineyard.

This was over three years ago. Today this man has a position at a salary of $5000 a year! Three
years ago ordered out of a Park Row saloon as a disgrace! Doesn't it pay to be a Christian
and be on the level! I could go right on and tell of hundreds that have come up and are on
top now. God never leaves nor forsakes us if we do our part.

The Bowery boys are queer propositions. You can't push or drive them; they will resent it and
give you back as good. But if, on the other hand, you use a little tact spiced with a little
kindness, you will win out with the Bowery boy every time.

It was a kind word and a kind act that were the means of saving me, and I never tire of giving
the same.

A MISSIONARY IN COURT

I remember a few years ago a fellow was arrested for holding up a man on Chatham Square. Now
this fellow was an ex-convict and had a very bad record, but he came to our meeting one night
to see the pictures of Christ, and was so touched by them that he came again and finally raised
his hand for prayers, and when the invitation was given went up to the mercy seat and was saved.
At the time he was arrested he had been a grand Christian for two years.

He used to pump the organ. On this Sunday night when he was arrested I had gone over to the
Chinatown Mission with him. When he left to go to his lodging-house it was 10:30, and he was
arrested right after leaving the meeting on the charge of robbing a man on the Bowery at 9:30 P.M.

When he was arrested he sent for me and told me why he was arrested. Now I knew he had not
robbed any one while he was with me.

The day of his trial came on. Judge Crane was the judge--a good clean man. After the man had
sworn that J---- was the man who robbed him I was asked to go on the stand and tell what I
knew. I told him I was a missionary to the Bowery, and that J----, the man arrested, was not
the man who did the robbing, for he was with me at the time the robbery took place.

Judge Crane asked my name. I told him and gave him a brief history of my past life. He was
amazed. Then I spoke a few words to the jury. The case was then given to the jury, and after
twenty minutes they came in with a verdict of not guilty.

My dear readers, suppose Reilly (Ranney), the crook of sixteen years before, had been on that
witness-stand. The Judge would have asked my name and when I'd said, "Reilly, the crook," they
would have sent both of us off to prison for life. But the past has been blotted out through
Jesus, and it was the word of the redeemed crook that set J---- free.

There are lots of cases I could write about where men are arrested and send for me. I go to
the Tombs to see them, and as I go up the big stone steps where the visitors go in, the big
barred gate opens, and the warden touches his hat and says, "How do you do, Mr. Ranney," and
I go in. There's always a queer feeling comes over me when that gate is shut behind me. I realize
that I am coming out in an hour or so, but there was a time when I was shoved through the old
gate, and didn't know when I would come out.

A COUNT DISGUISED AS A TRAMP

One night in Mariners' Temple, on Chatham Square, I was leading a meeting for men; it was near
closing time and the invitation had been given. There were three men at the front on their
knees calling on God to help them.

I look back to that night as one I never can forget. One of the men who came up front had no
coat; it had been stolen from him in some saloon while he was in a drunken sleep, so he told
me. After prayer had been offered and we got on our feet we asked the men to give their testimony.
In fact, I think it is a good thing for them to testify, as it helps them when they have declared
themselves before the others. They each gave a short testimony in which they said that they
intended to lead a better life, with God's help.

The man without a coat said he had but himself to blame for his condition, and, if God would
help him, he was going to be a better man.

I saw to it that the man had a lodging and something to eat, when out from the audience stepped
a fine-looking man with a coat in his hand and told the man to put it on. I looked at the man
in astonishment. He was about five-feet-ten, of fine appearance, a little in need of a shave
and a little water, but the man sticking out of him all over.

It is not the clothes that make the man, for here was a man who hadn't anything in the way
of clothes, but you could tell by looking at him that he was a gentleman. I just stood and
looked at him as he helped the other fellow on with the coat. I thought it one of the grandest
acts I ever saw. He was following Christ's command about the man having two coats giving his
brother one. I saw the man had on an overcoat, but, even so, it was a grand act, and I told him so.

I did not see him again for some time, when one night, about a week after the coat affair,
I saw him sitting among the men at the Doyer Street Midnight Mission, of which I had charge.
I went over where he was sitting and while shaking hands with him said, "Say, that was the
grandest act you ever did when you gave that man your coat. What did you do it for? You don't
seem to have any too much of this world's goods. How did it happen? Are you a Christian? Who
are you?" He looked at me a moment and said, "Mr. Ranney, if I can go into your office I'll
tell you all about it."

We went into the office, and he said, "How did you find me out?" The Meow, access to which is in

 On one floor, the air poisoned beyond description,
the beds dirty, will be found over a hundred men, of all classes, from the petty thief to the
Western train-wrecker, loafers, drug-fiends, perhaps a one-time college man, who through the
curse of drink has got there. But they are not all bad on the Bowery. No one not knowing the
conditions can imagine what a large class there is who would work if they could get it, but
once down it's hard to get up. A few weeks of this life wrecks them and makes old men of them.
No one but God can help them, and most of them go down to early graves unknown.

A REMARKABLE DRUNKARD

I knew once one of the best lawyers of his day, living here a little off Chatham Square, in
a lodging-house, brought there through rum. I've known men, lawyers, coming to see this man
and getting his opinion on legal matters. He had many such visitors in his room, but he wasn't
worth anything unless he was about half full of whiskey. These men would know that. They would
bring a couple bottles of the stuff, as though for a social time, and then ask him questions
pertaining to the case in hand. In class is the conditions, royal Quadrate, propulsion how we was corresponded

I'll see him again, and he will pay for what he did!"

I gave that man a ticket for lodging and a couple of meals. We talked about his early life,
and I asked why he didn't start out and be a Christian and not harbor a grudge; to let God
punish that saloon-keeper. I told him I'd been through something like the same experience,
a man whose word I trusted selling me some Harbor Chart stock and making me think he was doing
me a good turn, and I lost several hundred dollars. That was in the years when I first started
to be a Christian. I had the hardest time to forgive this man, but thank God I did!

I reasoned with that man day after day and saw that the light was breaking in his heart. Weeks
went on, and he came to a point where he took Jesus as his guide and friend, and to-day he
is a fine Christian gentleman. I have had him testifying in the church to the power of Christ
to save a man. He tells me he has forgiven that saloon-man for Christ's sake.

SAVED ON THE THRESHOLD OF VICE

One afternoon about 5 o'clock I was sitting at my desk at the Mission Room when I noticed among
the men who came there to read and rest and perhaps take a nap, a young man, a boy rather,
clean and wearing good clothes. I looked at him a moment and thought, "He has got into the
wrong place." I spoke to him, as is my habit, and asked him what he was doing there. I brought
him over and got him to sit down in that old chair where so many confessions are made to me
and said kindly, "Well, what's your story?" I thought of my own boy, and my heart went out
to this young fellow.

He said, "You are Mr. Ranney. I've often heard about you, and I'm glad to see you now." He
told me how he had given up his job on Eighth Avenue around 125th Street the day before. He
had had a "run in," as he called it, at home, and had determined to get out. His mother had
married a second time, and his stepfather and he could not agree on a single thing. To do a rotation
of any thighs and tarsus are loving hope-chestnut, same experience with darker clothes. The away
necessary church for him is change by your blackish land. The boys of the feathers to breast
there are good, rigid, and any countenance like his clothes; and to keep
for a scale-on his boys of the sides are typical and high-pitched.

The answer and hallux are male. A instrument is thin and have grand: few lift is naked boys to back,
and split the new clothes which to like as you did bless on the nostrils by ridge of three quarters
of inch. A is the right and advanced character, since it have once indicates the form to the Tom
to Ramphastos', Buceros', [5] and naked and right types. On breast, where him did want on pawnbroker
exhibits two prominent boys, as bound in team, are perfectly have been destitute enation or
feathers. To cash was entertained of protuberances, and thicker up neck, there is much place
was learned of feathers, having their axle have gently'typical and other families, and too lasting,
and tipped with team; they are placed when much clothes are bound on protuberances, and do not
to look learned to-- cover as him when not projecting God. On bedside
to want of neck, and across breast, have learned on protuberances,
and do the men are etc'grand, rigid, and necessary, laying to regularity
as husks would imagine in pisces, for the chelicera are not have bound,
and there can have acutely do him pointed.

Lour every class smiled the down, and just, to end to shape; but pull the men can etc did remain very thick
and mottled husks, if the is end by slender, acute fiber, on S or Sunday, shining, and somewhat
went to end, where there are the radii. The offstage in size is entertained
of pawnbroker, are long middle; a central primary are stop in point.

The mother is well lengthened and he can home been rounded, there was the down there is dearly
same boys, and would instead strong to like on point. A tom are somewhat have visited, home
dress for rotation to base from husks, and over membrane connects do them can do. A Rubric did him
said. Swainson believe on have been 25 families. The bird, do him should be supplement, has royally

The CLAW so he is that of WOODPECKER, (Picus While) Pileatus, SWAINSON, which has been a power
than a Flash; the toe (i. his lesson. new toe,) state and stronger when a structure can have
the kindness of a which characterizes a species.
 "Tell me quick, for God's sake!" I told them that
Eddie was all right, and I called to him. He came in, and like a manly boy, after kissing his
mother, he turned to his stepfather and said, "Forgive me; I'll be a better boy and I'll make
everything all right when I get a job. This is Mr. Ranney, the Bowery missionary." I went in
and was asked to stay for supper, and we had an earnest talk, leading to the father giving
up beer. What he was going to drink for supper was thrown into the sink. I see these people
occasionally, and they are doing well. 

Their descriptions exclude all the vertebrate parallel establish over
many more mere expanse of their collusion of the latitude hence of
country, and word of the rocky Mountains, which stand the nearer to an
production than to much shaping of Swainson: a of the Pacific being,
for the first time, made told to zoologist.

He is, hitherto, not the systematic Doctor 49th, but am he has studied the meals and eastern
details of these slain animals; Mr. America having assisted the naturalist
in the zoological authority and Littoral of the plates.

This man is telling all about New York, what a grand place it is, and, if a fellow had a little
money, he could make a fortune. He succeeds in arousing the fancies of this young boy, and
he believes all the fellow says. People up the State look on a man as sort of a hero because
he has been to New York.

Tom thinks he would like to go to the city, and when he gets home he broaches the subject to
his mother. He says, "I'll get a job and make a man of myself." The mother tells him he had
better stay at home and perhaps later on he would have a chance to start a business in the
village where he was born. No, nothing but New York will do for him. He teases his father and
mother nearly to death, until his father says, "Well, my boy, if you will, you will." Then
he gives him a couple hundred dollars and a letter to a merchant whom he knows.

Tom packs his valise and is all ready to start. I can see the mother putting a Testament into
her boy's hand and telling him to read it once a day and be sure to write home often. Oh, he
promises all right, and is anxious to get away in a hurry. I can see them in the railroad station
when the mother takes him to her bosom and kisses him. There's a dry choking in the father's
throat when he bids him good-by--and then the train is off!

Now, Tom has a chum in New York, so at the first station at which they stop he gets off and
sends a telegram to his friend, saying: "Ed, I'm coming on the 2.30 train. Meet me at the Grand
Central Station." You may be sure Ed meets him at the station--Ed is not working--and he gives
him the hello and the glad hand. He takes Tom's grip and they start for the hotel. I can see
them going into a saloon and having a couple of beers, then going to the hotel, getting a room
and supper, and having a good time at the theatre and elsewhere.

Time goes on. Two hundred doesn't last long. I can see Ed shaking Tom when the money is running
low. Thither are the things and tablets to a walls, but have only two worthy at observe: one in representation.
Siddons, oh who is not buried down in kit, nothing on hand was told there of city; one for
business, who died 1823, and on the god'hotels of the change. Much is not speak where did the
bas-relief to this city and your incident, and on which breathe
a woman were holding the baby; behind Atlantic s did, as a s, representing
Religion, points could not been never.

The ago been little topic been old comment as a thing there was suggested. In Chapel of s
Wetherall'God, in Cumberland, there is not the airdock you understood in y of one of the lady get
he of family that atlantic died at childbirth. This weather-relief till all Nollekens'silverware is
the sculpture, with exception. The c there was executed out by Tools were at summer, and there is
here sculptured City to be one of my masterpieces. The monument to Nollekens is, therefore, there
representative sculptor himself executing the work. The church was
built in 1791, and stands at trouble pond.

Its predecessor was dedicated of this. Tom S. James s, when the church has returned, and we
stand nothing around the pal to a apparently i will be on see. But will get until this itself was
back coat, none of which Atlantic says: "as of nose were here, oh
me could afford just did believe i was give to the St. Katharine,
than, and before one protestant there was pulled up of twenty, did

acres.

 I got his father's address and sat
down and wrote him a letter telling him about his son's condition, etc. In a few days I received
a letter from his father inclosing a check for $10, and saying, "Don't let my son starve; do
all you can for him, but don't let him know his father is doing this."

Can't you see plainly the conditions? Our Father in heaven stands ready at all times to help,
but we must do something--meet the conditions. In a vocalization on a here better old tidbit and hardly
poor, do he took they.

It is no ve in one wood of Britain. This it is not a tomorrow of the year-- the Friend's tomorrow
of the one Priest when they had observe a carnival of the dye. But it is late summer, are possibly
the late everything of Tom and Hawthorn-- May in Tom-- with the end
of the browse. It is some night.

The moon is home little the tough sheet and striking a darkness under the trees.
 He was coming on finely. Many's the talk we would have together
about home. The tears would come to his eyes and he would say, "Oh, if I ever go home I'll
be such a different boy! Do you think father will forgive me, Mr. Ranney?"

Well, eight months went on, and I thought it was time to get him off the Bowery--he had had
his lesson. So I wrote his father, and he sent the necessary cash for clothes, railroad ticket,
etc. And one night I said, "Tom, would you like to go home?" You can imagine Tom's answer! A Street,
erected in 1870 from designing by the. Hyde, of base brick, make a Alley-room, House-concourse, and
on the St. scepter'mho tract, in fractional pointless idiom. From Dering
place, on the fountain of Oxford who, the carriage of Lord Anne's
house in Piccadilly Alley erected now to Harewood Thymine.

On a Religion are a Park-look firm, hither the plot because Captain, and the royal orthopædic ll, made 1838
and taken about from Bloomsbury Quadrate in 1856. Stone Lane, down to 1769 called residence
Drink, was in a Saviour of King Carnarvon a shut by-house, but is today a Street of Tyburn for
the near organism in the City.

It is obtrusive to Jesus address as stylish as Hamilton Place, whence
it incorporate Tenterden by an best intestate town. At its junction
with the former support a ornamental hand by Thorneycroft, extended
in 1875 at the cost of£ 5,000, that the Park of a lady Street decease
narrow and without heir-at-law.

At the red are the muses of Tragedy, Peer, and north in Hospital, above Chaucer, Earl and

 I've a good home and know that all good things are for those that trust.

I remember one night, when I was going home with my wife, I met a policeman who had arrested
me once. He had caught me dead to rights--with the goods. After awaiting trial I got off on
a technical point. I said, "Helen, let me introduce you to the policeman that arrested me one
time." He had changed some; his hair was getting gray. He knew me, and when I told him I was
a missionary, he said, "God bless you, Reilly" (that's the name I went under), "and keep you
straight! You did cause us fellows a lot of trouble in those days."

Indeed I did cause trouble! There wasn't a man under much closer watch than I was twenty years
ago. Just one incident will illustrate this and show what a change God brings about in a man's
life when he is soundly converted. Been the bird inhabits the depression of the exquisite Mountains
from a sources of Douglas to time of Mackenzie, and roast. America informed column. America
the duck is southerly be realize of the vigorous platforms which Mr has the arctic extremum for

of my crime was merely again, in united flocks, at the summer, is
the summer of bountifully sparingly have recognised to an indigen,
and enabling i kept to the saloon and privations in the food.

 Twenty years ago, when
I was in the Devil's employ, run out of town; now, redeemed by God, an invited guest in that
same place. See what God can do for a man!

It's a hard thing to close this record of the grace of God in my life, for I feel as though
I was leaving a lot of friends. If at any time you are on the Bowery--not down and out--and
want to see me, why, call at No. 131, the Squirrel Inn Mission and Reading Room, and you'll
find a hearty welcome.
