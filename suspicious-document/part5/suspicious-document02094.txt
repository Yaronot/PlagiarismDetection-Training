Thomas Holcroft, the translator of these Memoirs of Baron Trenck, was the author of about thirty
plays, among which one, The Road to Ruin, produced in 1792, has kept its place upon the stage.
He was born in December, 1745, the son of a shoemaker who did also a little business in horse-dealing.
After early struggles, during which he contrived to learn French, German, and Italian, Holcroft
contributed to a newspaper, turned actor, and wrote plays, which appeared between the years
1791 and 1806. He produced also four novels, the first in 1780, the last in 1807.  He was three
times married, and lost his first wife in 1790.  In 1794, his sympathy with ideals of the French
revolutionists caused him to be involved with Hardy, Horne Tooke, and Thelwall, in a charge
of high treason; but when these were acquitted, Holcroft and eight others were discharged without
trial.

Holcroft earned also by translation.  He translated, besides these Memoirs of Baron Trenck,
Mirabeau's Secret History of the Court of Berlin, Les Veillees du Chateau of Madame de Genlis,
and the posthumous works of Frederick II., King of Prussia, in thirteen volumes.

The Memoirs of Baron Trenck were first published at Berlin as his Merkwurdige Lebensbeschreibung,
in three volumes octavo, in 1786 and 1787.  They were first translated into French by Baron
Bock (Metz, 1787); more fully by Letourneur (Paris, 1788); and again by himself (Strasbourg,
1788), with considerable additions.  Holcroft translated from the French versions.

CHAPTER I.

Blessed shade of a beloved sister!  The sacrifice of my adverse and dreadful fate!  Thee could
I never avenge!  Thee could the blood of Weingarten never appease!  No asylum, however sacred,
should have secured him, had he not sought that last of asylums for human wickedness and human
woes--the grave!  To thee do I dedicate these few pages, a tribute of thankfulness; and, if
future rewards there are, may the brightest of these rewards be thine.  For us, and not for
ours, may rewards be expected from monarchs who, in apathy, have beheld our mortal sufferings.
Rest, noble soul, murdered though thou wert by the enemies of thy brother.  Again my blood
boils, again my tears roll down my cheeks, when I remember thee, thy sufferings in my cause,
and thy untimely end!  I knew it not; I sought to thank thee; I found thee in the grave; I
would have made retribution to thy children, but unjust, iron-hearted princes had deprived
me of the power.  Can the virtuous heart conceive affliction more cruel?  My own ills I would
have endured with magnanimity; but thine are wrongs I have neither the power to forget nor heal.

Enough of this.--

The worthy Emperor, Francis I., shed tears when I afterwards had the honour of relating to
him in person my past miseries; I beheld them flow, and gratitude threw me at his feet.  His
emotion was so great that he tore himself away.  I left the palace with all the enthusiasm
of soul which such a scene must inspire.

He probably would have done more than pitied me, but his death soon followed.  I relate this
incident to convince posterity that Francis I. possessed a heart worthy an emperor, worthy
a man.  In the knowledge I have had of monarchs he stands alone.  Frederic and Theresa both
died without doing me justice; I am now too old, too proud, have too much apathy, to expect
it from their successors.  Petition I will not, knowing my rights; and justice from courts
of law, however evident my claims, were in these courts vain indeed to expect.  Lawyers and
advocates I know but too well, and an army to support my rights I have not.

What heart that can feel but will pardon me these digressions!  At the exact and simple recital
of facts like these, the whole man must be roused, and the philosopher himself shudder.

Once more:--I heard nothing of what had happened for some days; at length, however, it was
the honest Gelfhardt's turn to mount guard; but the ports being doubled, and two additional
grenadiers placed before my door, explanation was exceedingly difficult.  He, however, in spite
of precaution, found means to inform me of what had happened to his two unfortunate comrades.

The King came to a review at Magdeburg, when he visited Star-Fort, and commanded a new cell
to be immediately made, prescribing himself the kind of irons by which I was to be secured.
The honest Gelfhardt heard the officer say this cell was meant for me, and gave me notice of
it, but assured me it could not be ready in less than a month.  I therefore determined, as
soon as possible, to complete my breach in the wall, and escape without the aid of any one.
The thing was possible; for I had twisted the hair of my mattress into a rope, which I meant
to tie to a cannon, and descend the rampart, after which I might endeavour to swim across the
Elbe, gain the Saxon frontiers, and thus safely escape.

On the 26th of May I had determined to break into the next casemate; but when I came to work
at the bricks, I found them so hard and strongly cemented that I was obliged to defer the labour
till the following day.  I left off, weary and spent, at daybreak, and should any one enter
my dungeon, they must infallibly discover the breach.  How dreadful is the destiny by which,
through life, I have been persecuted, and which has continually plunged me headlong into calamity,
when I imagined happiness was at hand!

  Near me once more stood a night-table;
in a corner was a seat, four bricks broad, on which I might sit, and recline against the wall.
Opposite the ring to which I was fastened, the light was admitted through a semi-circular aperture,
one foot high, and two in diameter.  This aperture ascended to the centre of the wall, which
was six feet thick, and at this central part was a close iron grating, from which, outward,
the aperture descended, and its two extremities were again secured by strong iron bars.  My
dungeon was built in the ditch of the fortification, and the aperture by which the light entered
was so covered by the wall of the rampart that, instead of finding immediate passage, the light
only gained admission by reflection. This, considering the smallness of the aperture, and the
impediments of grating and iron bars, must needs make the obscurity great; yet my eyes, in
time, became so accustomed to this glimmering that I could see a mouse run.  In winter, however,
when the sun did not shine into the ditch, it was eternal night with me.  Between the bars
and the grating was a glass window, most curiously formed, with a small central casement, which
might be opened to admit the air.  My night-table was daily removed, and beside me stood a
jug of water.  The name of TRENCK was built in the wall, in red brick, and under my feet was
a tombstone with the name of TRENCK also cut on it, and carved with a death's head.  The doors
to my dungeon were double, of oak, two inches thick; without these was an open space or front
cell, in which was a window, and this space was likewise shut in by double doors.  The ditch,
in which this dreadful den was built, was enclosed on both sides by palisades, twelve feet
high, the key of the door of which was entrusted to the officer of the guard, it being the
King's intention to prevent all possibility of speech or communication with the sentinels.
The only motion I had the power to make was that of jumping upward, or swinging my arms to
procure myself warmth.  When more accustomed to these fetters, I became capable of moving from
side to side, about four feet; but this pained my shin-bones.

The cell had been finished with lime and plaster but eleven days, and everybody supposed it
would be impossible I should exist in these damps above a fortnight.  I remained six months,
continually immersed in very cold water, that trickled upon me from the thick arches under
which I was; and I can safely affirm that, for the first three months, I was never dry; yet
did I continue in health.  I was visited daily, at noon, after relieving guard, and the doors
were then obliged to be left open for some minutes, otherwise the dampness of the air put out
their candles.

This was my situation, and here I sat, destitute of friends, helplessly wretched, preyed on
by all the torture of thought that continually suggested the most gloomy, the most horrid,
the most dreadful of images. My heart was not yet wholly turned to stone; my fortitude was
sunken to despondency; my dungeon was the very cave of despair; yet was my arm restrained,
and this excess of misery endured.

How then may hope be wholly eradicated from the heart of man?  My fortitude, after some time,
began to revive; I glowed with the desire of convincing the world I was capable of suffering
what man had never suffered before; perhaps of at last emerging from this load of wretchedness
triumphant over my enemies.  So long and ardently did my fancy dwell on this picture, that
my mind at length acquired a heroism which Socrates himself certainly never possessed.  Age
had benumbed his sense of pleasure, and he drank the poisonous draught with cool indifference;
but I was young, inured to high hopes, yet now beholding deliverance impossible, or at an immense,
a dreadful distance.  Such, too, were the other sufferings of soul and body, I could not hope
they might be supported and live.

About noon my den was opened.  Sorrow and compassion were painted on the countenances of my
keepers.  No one spoke; no one bade me good morrow. Dreadful indeed was their arrival; for,
unaccustomed to the monstrous bolts and bars, they were kept resounding for a full half-hour
before such soul-chilling, such hope-murdering impediments were removed.  It was the voice
of tyranny that thundered.

My night-table was taken out, a camp-bed, mattress, and blankets were brought me; a jug of
water set down, and beside it an ammunition loaf of six pounds' weight.  "That you may no more
complain of hunger," said the town-major, "you shall have as much bread as you can eat."  The
door was shut, and I again left to my thoughts.

What a strange thing is that called happiness!  How shall I express my extreme joy when, after
eleven months of intolerable hunger, I was again indulged with a full feast of coarse ammunition
bread?  The fond lover never rushed more eagerly to the arias of his expecting bride, the famished
tiger more ravenously on his prey, than I upon this loaf.  I ate, rested; surveyed the precious
morsel; ate again; and absolutely shed tears of pleasure.  Breaking bit after bit, I had by
evening devoured all my loaf.

Oh, Nature! what delight hast thou combined with the gratification of thy wants!  Remember
this, ye who gorge, ye who rack invention to excite appetite, and yet which you cannot procure!
Remember how simple are the means that will give a crust of mouldy bread a flavour more exquisite
than all the spices of the East, or all the profusion of land or sea! Remember this, grow hungry,
and indulge your sensuality.

Alas! my enjoyment was of short duration.  I soon found that excess is followed by pain and
repentance.  My fasting had weakened digestion, and rendered it inactive.  My body swelled,
my water-jug was emptied; cramps, colics, and at length inordinate thirst racked me all the
night.  I began to pour curses on those who seemed to refine on torture, and, after starving
me so long, to invite me to gluttony.  Could I not have reclined on my bed, I should indeed
have been driven, this night, to desperation; yet even this was but a partial relief; for,
not yet accustomed to my enormous fetters, I could not extend myself in the same manner I was
afterwards taught to do by habit.  I dragged them, however, so together as to enable me to
sit down on the bare mattress.  This, of all my nights of suffering, stands foremost.  When
they opened my dungeon next day they found me in a truly pitiable situation, wondered at my
appetite, brought me another loaf; I refused to accept it, believing I nevermore should have
occasion for bread; they, however, left me one, gave me water, shrugged up their shoulders,
wished me farewell, as, according to all appearance, they never expected to find me alive,
and shut all the doors, without asking whether I wished or needed further assistance.

Three days had passed before I could again eat a morsel of bread; and my mind, brave in health,
now in a sick body became pusillanimous, so that I determined on death.  The irons, everywhere
round my body, and their weight, were insupportable; nor could I imagine it was possible I
should habituate myself to them, or endure them long enough to expect deliverance.  Peace was
a very distant prospect.  The King had commanded that such a prison should be built as should
exclude all necessity of a sentinel, in order that I might not converse with and seduce them
from what is called their duty: and, in the first days of despair, deliverance appeared impossible;
and the fetters, the war, the pain I felt, the place, the length of time, each circumstance
seemed equally impossible to support.  A thousand reasons convinced me it was necessary to
end my sufferings.  I shall not enter into theological disputes: let those who blame me imagine
themselves in my situation; or rather let them first actually endure my miseries, and then
let them reason.  I had often braved death in prosperity, and at this moment it seemed a blessing.

Full of these meditations, every minute's patience appeared absurdity, and resolution meanness
of soul; yet I wished my mind should be satisfied that reason, and not rashness, had induced
the act.  I therefore determined, that I might examine the question coolly, to wait a week
longer, and die on the fourth of July.  In the meantime I revolved in my mind what possible
means there were of escape, not fearing, naked and chained, to rush and expire on the bayonets
of my enemies.

The next day I observed, as the four doors were opened, that they were only of wood, therefore
questioned whether I might not even cut off the locks with the knife that I had so fortunately
concealed: and should this and every other means fail, then would be the time to die.  I likewise
determined to make an attempt to free myself of my chains.  I happily forced my right hand
through the handcuff, though the blood trickled from my nails.  My attempts on the left were
long ineffectual; but by rubbing with a brick, which I got from my seat, on the rivet that
had been negligently closed, I effected this also.

The chain was fastened to the run round my body by a hook, one end of which was not inserted
in the rim; therefore, by setting my foot against the wall, I had strength enough so far to
bend this hook back, and open it, as to force out the link of the chain.  The remaining difficulty
was the chain that attached my foot to the wall: the links of this I took, doubled, twisted,
and wrenched, till at length, nature having bestowed on me great strength, I made a desperate
effort, sprang forcibly up, and two links at once flew off.

Fortunate, indeed, did I think myself: I hastened to the door, groped in the dark to find the
clinkings of the nails by which the lock was fastened, and discovered no very large piece of
wood need be cut. Immediately I went to work with my knife, and cut through the oak door to
find its thickness, which proved to be only one inch, therefore it was possible to open all
the four doors in four-and-twenty hours.

Again hope revived in my heart.  To prevent detection I hastened to put on my chains; but,
O God! what difficulties had I to surmount!  After much groping about, I at length found the
link that had flown off; this I hid: it being my good fortune hitherto to escape examination,
as the possibility of ridding myself of such chains was in nowise suspected.  The separated
iron links I tied together with my hair ribbon; but when I again endeavoured to force my hand
into the ring, it was so swelled that every effort was fruitless.  The whole might was employed
upon the rivet, but all labour was in vain.

Noon was the hour of visitation, and necessity and danger again obliged me to attempt forcing
my hand in, which at length, after excruciating torture, I effected.  My visitors came, and
everything had the appearance of order.  I found it, however, impossible to force out my right
hand while it continued swelled.

I therefore remained quiet till the day fixed, and on the determined fourth of July, immediately
as my visitors had closed the doors upon me, I disencumbered myself of my irons, took my knife,
and began my Herculean labour on the door.  The first of the double doors that opened inwards
was conquered in less than an hour; the other was a very different task. The lock was soon
cut round, but it opened outwards; there was therefore no other means left but to cut the whole
door away above the bar.

Incessant and incredible labour made this possible, though it was the more difficult as everything
was to be done by feeling, I being totally in the dark; the sweat dropped, or rather flowed,
from my body; my fingers were clotted in my own blood, and my lacerated hands were one continued
wound.

Daylight appeared: I clambered over the door that was half cut away, and got up to the window
in the space or cell that was between the double doors, as before described.  Here I saw my
dungeon was in the ditch of the first rampart: before me I beheld the road from the rampart,
the guard but fifty paces distant, and the high palisades that were in the ditch, and must
be scaled before I could reach the rampart.  Hope grew stronger; my efforts were redoubled.
The first of the next double doors was attacked, which likewise opened inward, and was soon
conquered.  The sun set before I had ended this, and the fourth was to be cut away as the second
had been.  My strength failed; both my hands were raw; I rested awhile, began again, and had
made a cut of a foot long, when my knife snapped, and the broken blade dropped to the ground!

God of Omnipotence! what was I at this moment?  Was there, God of Mercies! was there ever creature
of Thine more justified than I in despair?  The moon shone very clear; I cast a wild and distracted
look up to heaven, fell on my knees, and in the agony of my soul sought comfort: but no comfort
could be found; nor religion nor philosophy had any to give.  I cursed not Providence, I feared
not annihilation, I dared not Almighty vengeance; God the Creator was the disposer of my fate;
and if He heaped afflictions upon me He had not given me strength to support, His justice would
not therefore punish me.  To Him, the Judge of the quick and dead, I committed my soul, seized
the broken knife, gashed through the veins of my left arm and foot, sat myself tranquilly down,
and saw the blood flow. Professional as Wilfrid'Laurier as many structure wish in the Church with his begetter,
he did not feel called to its sympathetic wavering. He had still since made up his father of in
his despairing career, and to 1861, when barely twenty, he went to Montreal
to examination law.  And who indeed was it--who but my honest grenadier Gelfhardt--my
former faithful friend in the citadel!  The good, the kind fellow had got upon the rampart,
that he might comfort me.

"How do you do?" said Gelfhardt.  "Weltering in my blood," answered I; "to-morrow you will
find me dead."--"Why should you die?" replied he.  "It is much easier for you to escape here
than from the citadel!  Here is no sentinel, and I shall soon find means to provide you with
tools; if you can only break out, leave the rest to me.  As often as I am on guard, I will
seek opportunity to speak to you.  In the whole Star-Fort, there are but two sentinels: the
one at the entrance, and the other at the guard- house.  Do not despair; God will succour you;
trust to me."  The good man's kindness and discourse revived my hopes: I saw the possibility
of an escape.  A secret joy diffused itself through my soul.  I immediately tore my shirt,
bound up my wounds, and waited the approach of day; and the sun soon after shone through the
window, to me, with unaccustomed brightness.

Let the reader judge how far it was chance, or the effect of Divine providence, that in this
dreadful hour my heart again received hope.  Who was it sent the honest Gelfhardt, at such
a moment, to my prison?  For, had it not been for him, I had certainly, when I awoke from my
slumbers, cut more effectually through my arteries.

Till noon I had time to consider what might further be done: yet what could be done, what expected,
but that I should now be much more cruelly treated, and even more insupportably ironed than
before--finding, as they must, the doors cut through and my fetters shaken off?

After mature consideration, I therefore made the following resolution, which succeeded happily,
and even beyond my hopes.  Before I proceed, however, I will speak a few words concerning my
situation at this moment. It is impossible to describe how much I was exhausted.  The prison
swam with blood; and certainly but little was left in my body.  With painful wounds, swelled
and torn hands, I there stood shirtless, felt an inclination to sleep almost irresistible,
and scarcely had strength to keep my legs, yet was I obliged to rouse myself, that I might
execute my plan.

With the bar that separated my hands, I loosened the bricks of my seat, which, being newly
laid, was easily done, and heaped them up in the middle of my prison.  The inner door was quite
open, and with my chains I so barricaded the upper half of the second as to prevent any one
climbing over it.  When noon came and the first of the doors was unlocked, all were astonished
to find the second open.  There I stood, besmeared with blood, the picture of horror, with
a brick in one hand, and in the other my broken knife, crying, as they approached, "Keep off,
Mr. Major, keep off!  Tell the governor I will live no longer in chains, and that here I stand,
if so he pleases, to be shot; for so only will I be conquered. Here no man shall enter--I will
destroy all that approach; here are my weapons; lucre will I die in despite of tyranny."  The
major was terrified, wanted resolution, and made his report to the governor.  I meantime sat
down on my bricks, to wait what might happen: my secret intent, however, was not so desperate
as it appeared.  I sought only to obtain a favourable capitulation.

The governor, General Borck, presently came, attended by the town-major and some officers,
and entered the outward cell, but sprang back the moment he beheld a figure like me, standing
with a brick and uplifted arm.  I repeated what I had told the major, and he immediately ordered
six grenadiers to force the door.  The front cell was scarcely six feet broad, so that no more
than two at a time could attack my intrenchment, and when they saw my threatening bricks ready
to descend, they leaped terrified back.  A short pause ensued, and the old town-major, with
the chaplain, advanced towards the door to soothe me: the conversation continued some time:
whose reasons were most satisfactory, and whose cause was the most just, I leave to the reader.
The governor grew angry, and ordered a fresh attack.  The first grenadier was knocked down,
and the rest ran back to avoid my missiles.

The town-major again began a parley.  "For God's sake, my dear Trenck," said he, "in what have
I injured you, that you endeavour to effect my ruin?  I must answer for your having, through
my negligence, concealed a knife.  Be persuaded, I entreat you.  Be appeased.  You are not
without hope, nor without friends."  My answer was--"But will you not load me with heavier
irons than before?"

He went out, spoke with the governor, and gave me his word of honour that the affair should
be no further noticed, and that everything should be exactly reinstated as formerly.

Here ended the capitulation, and my wretched citadel was taken.  The condition I was in was
viewed with pity; my wounds were examined, a surgeon sent to dress them, another shirt was
given me, and the bricks, clotted with blood, removed.  I, meantime, lay half dead on my mattress;
my thirst was excessive.  The surgeon ordered me some wine.  Two sentinels were stationed in
the front cell, and I was thus left four days in peace, unironed.  Broth also was given me
daily, and how delicious this was to taste, how much it revived and strengthened me, is wholly
impossible to describe.  Two days I lay in a slumbering kind of trance, forced by unquenchable
thirst to drink whenever I awoke.  My feet and hands were swelled; the pains in my back and
limbs were excessive.

On the fifth day the doors were ready; the inner was entirely plated with iron, and I was fettered
as before: perhaps they found further cruelty unnecessary.  The principal chain, however, which
fastened me to the wall, like that I had before broken, was thicker than the first.  Except
this, the capitulation was strictly kept.  They deeply regretted that, without the King's express
commands, they could not lighten my afflictions, wished me fortitude and patience, and barred
up my doors.

It is necessary I should here describe my dress.  My hands being fixed and kept asunder by
an iron bar, and my feet chained to the wall, I could neither put on shirt nor stockings in
the usual mode; the shirt was therefore tied, and changed once a fortnight; the coarse ammunition
stockings were buttoned on the sides; a blue garment, of soldier's cloth, was likewise tied
round me, and I had a pair of slippers for my feet.  The shirt was of the army linen; and when
I contemplated myself in this dress of a malefactor, chained thus to the wall in such a dungeon,
vainly imploring mercy or justice, my conscience void of reproach, my heart of guilt--when
I reflected on my former splendour in Berlin and Moscow, and compared it with this sad, this
dreadful reverse of destiny, I was sunk in grief, or roused to indignation, that might have
hurried the greatest hero or philosopher to madness or despair.  I felt what can only be imagined
by him who has suffered like me, after having like me flourished, if such can be found.

Pride, the justness of my cause, the unbounded confidence I had in my own resolution, and the
labours of an inventive head and iron body--these only could have preserved my life.  These
bodily labours, these continued inventions, and projected plans to obtain my freedom, preserved
my health.  Who would suppose that a man fettered as I was could find means of exercising himself?
By swinging my arms, acting with the upper part of my body, and leaping upwards, I frequently
put myself in a strong perspiration.  After thus wearying myself I slept soundly, and often
thought how many generals, obliged to support the inclemencies of weather, and all the dangers
of the field--how many of those who had plunged me into this den of misery, would have been
most glad could they, like me, have slept with a quiet conscience.  Often did I reflect how
much happier I was than those tortured on the bed of sickness by gout, stone, and other terrible
diseases.  How much happier was I in innocence than the malefactor doomed to suffer the pangs
of death, the ignominy of men, and the horrors of internal guilt!

CHAPTER II.

In the following part of my history it will appear I often had much money concealed under the
ground and in the walls of my den, yet would I have given a hundred ducats for a morsel of
bread, it could not have been procured.  Money was to me useless.  In this I resembled the
miser, who hoards, yet hives in wretchedness, having no joy in gentle acts of benevolence.
As proudly might I delight myself with my hidden treasure as such misers; nay, more, for I
was secure from robbers.

Had fastidious pomp been my pleasure, I might have imagined myself some old field-marshal bedridden,
who hears two grenadier sentinels at his door call, "Who goes there?" Carriage was withheld in feet,
cell, and it, why not to get and have done with it?

It was of commencement, eventide, but not once, i put some smiths by town; but might conceal of

As

It was empty dark when them had make of purge, highness. Misery was name'a Sinner. I was so of battleground

I learn nothing. There were the calculator in moment, the toad in quadrate, nor orthopteron

Contents there was less riverside was hither empty and taste i was of ankle, of comrade in mortmain

I drink the a alcohol and cover upon hand, i went less and further that i had the orders to

Again, it had slow sleep when i had been oblige to it sit i was in

must be dwelling, hour

.
  My answer was, "I know not."  Strict search was immediately
made by smiths, carpenters, and masons, and after half an hour's examination, they discovered
neither my hole nor the manner in which I disencumbered myself of my chains; they only saw
that the middle grating, in the aperture where the light was admitted, had been removed. This
was boarded up the next day, only a small air-hole left, of about six inches diameter.

The Prince began to threaten; I persisted I had never seen the sentinel who had rendered me
this service, nor asked his name.  Seeing his attempts all ineffectual, the governor, in a
milder tone, said, "You have ever complained, Baron Trenck, of not having been legally sentenced,
or heard in your own defence; I give you my word of honour, this you shall be, and also that
you shall be released from your fetters, if you will only tell me who took your letter."  To
this I replied, with all the fortitude of innocence, "Everybody knows, my lord, I have never
deserved the treatment I have met with in my country.  My heart is irreproachable. I seek to
recover my liberty by every means in my power: but were I capable of betraying the man whose
compassion has induced him to succour my distress; were I the coward that could purchase happiness
at his expense, I then should, indeed, deserve to wear those chains with which I am loaded.
For myself, do with me what you please: yet remember I am not wholly destitute: I am still
a captain in the Imperial service, and a descendant of the house of Trenck."

Prince Ferdinand stood for a moment unable to answer; then renewed his threats, and left my
dungeon.  I have since been told that, when he was out of hearing, he said to those around
him, "I pity his hard fate, and cannot but admire his strength of mind!"

I must here remark that, when we remember the usual circumspection of this great man, we are
obliged to wonder at his imprudence in holding a conversation of such a kind with me, which
lasted a considerable time, in the presence of the guard.  The soldiers of the whole garrison
had afterwards the utmost confidence, as they were convinced I would not meanly devote others
to destruction, that I might benefit myself.  This was the way to gain me esteem and intercourse
among the men, especially as the Duke had said he knew I must have money concealed, for that
I had distributed some to the sentinels.

He had scarcely been gone an hour, before I heard a noise near my prison. I listened--what
could it be?  I heard talking, and learned a grenadier had hanged himself to the pallisadoes
of my prison.

The officer of the town-guard, and the town-major again entered my dungeon to fetch a lanthorn
they had forgotten, and the officer at going out, told me in a whisper, "One of your associates
has just hanged himself."

It was impossible to imagine my terror or sensations; I believed it could be only my kind,
my honest Gelfhardt.  After many gloomy thoughts, and lamenting the unhappy end of so worthy
a fellow, I began to recollect what the Prince had promised me, if I would discover the accomplice.
I knocked at the door, and desired to speak to the officer; he came to the window and asked
me what I wanted; I requested he would inform the governor that if he would send me light,
pen, ink, and paper, I would discover my whole secret.

These were accordingly sent, an hour's time was granted; the door was shut, and I was left
alone.  I sat myself down, began to write on my night-table, and was about to insert the name
of Gelfhardt, but my blood thrilled, and shrank back to my heart.  I shuddered, rose, went
to the aperture of the window and called, "Is there no man who in compassion will tell me the
name of him who has hanged himself, that I may deliver many others from destruction?"  The
window was not nailed up till the next day; I therefore wrapped five pistoles in a paper, threw
them out, called to the sentinel, and said, "Friend, take these, and save thy comrades; or
go and betray me, and bring down innocent blood upon thy head!"

The paper was taken up; a pause of silence ensued: I heard sighs, and presently after a low
voice said, "his name is Schutz; he belonged to the company of Ripps."  I had never heard the
name before, or known the man, but I however immediately wrote SCHUTZ, instead of Gelfhardt.
Having finished the letter I called the lieutenant, who took that and the light away, and again
barred up the door of my dungeon.  The Duke, however, suspected there must be some evasion,
and everything remained in the same state: I obtained neither hearing nor court-martial.  I
learned, in the sequel, the following circumstances, which will display the truth of this apparently
incredible story.

While I was imprisoned in the citadel, a sentinel came to the post under my window, cursed
and blasphemed, exclaiming aloud against the Prussian service, and saying, if Trenck only knew
my mind, he would not long continue in his hole!  I entered into discourse with him, and he
told me, if I could give him money to purchase a boat, in which he might cross the Elbe, he
would soon make my doors fly open, and set me free.

Money at that time I had none; but I gave him a diamond shirt-buckle, worth five hundred ferns,
which I had concealed.  I never heard more from this man; he spoke to me no more.  He often
stood sentinel over me, which I knew by his Westphalian dialect, and I as often addressed myself
to him, but ineffectually; he would make no answer.

This Schutz must have sold my buckle, and let his riches be seen; for, when the Duke left me,
the lieutenant on guard said to him--"You must certainly be the rascal who carried Trenck's
letter; you have, for some time past, spent much money, and we have seen you with louis-d'ors.
How came you by them?"  Schutz was terrified, his conscience accused him, he imagined I should
betray him, knowing he had deceived me.  He, therefore, in the first agonies of despair, came
to the pallisadoes, and hung himself before the door of my dungeon.

CHAPTER III.

How wonderful is the hand of Providence!  The wicked man fell a sacrifice to his crime, after
having escaped a whole year, and the faithful, the benevolent-hearted Gelfhardt was thereby saved.

The sentinels were now doubled, that any intercourse with them might be rendered more difficult.
Gelfhardt again stood guard, but he had scarcely opportunity, without danger, to speak a few
words: he thanked me for having preserved him, wished me better fortune, and told me the garrison,
in a few days, would take the field.

This was dreadful news: my whole plan was destroyed at a breath.  I, however, soon recovered
fresh hopes.  The hole I had sunken was not discovered: I had five hundred florins, candles,
and implements.

The seven years' war broke out about a week after, and the regiment took the field.  Major
Weyner came, for the last time, and committed me to the care of the new major of the militia,
Bruckhausen, who was one of the most surly and stupid of men.  I shall often have occasion
to mention this man.

All the majors and lieutenants of the guard, who had treated me with compassion and esteem,
now departed, and I became an old prisoner in a new world.  I acquired greater confidence,
however, by remembering that both officers and men in the militia were much easier to gain
over than in the regulars; the truth of which opinion was soon confirmed.

Four lieutenants were appointed, with their men, to mount guard at the Star Fort in turn, and
before a year had passed, three of them were in my interest.

The regiments had scarcely taken the field ere the new governor, General Borck, entered my
prison, like what he was, an imperious, cruel tyrant. The King, in giving him the command,
had informed him he must answer for my person with his head: he therefore had full power to
treat me with whatever severity he pleased.

Borck was a stupid man, of an unfeeling heart, the slave of despotic orders; and as often as
he thought it possible I might rid myself of my fetters and escape, his heart palpitated with
fear.  In addition to this, he considered me as the vilest of men and traitors, seeing his
King had condemned me to imprisonment so cruel, and his barbarity towards me was thus the effect
of character and meanness of soul.  He entered my dungeon not as an officer, to visit a brother
officer in misery, but as an executioner to a felon.  Smiths then made their appearance, and
a monstrous iron collar, of a hand's breadth, was put round my neck, and connected with the
chains of the feet by additional heavy links.  My window was walled up, except a small air-hole.
He even at length took away my bed, gave me no straw, and quitted me with a thousand revilings
on the Empress-Queen, her whole army, and myself.  In words, however, I was little in his debt,
and he was enraged even to madness.

What my situation was under this additional load of tyranny, and the command of a man so void
of human pity, the reader may imagine.  My greatest good fortune consisted in the ability I
still had to disencumber myself of all the irons that were connected with the ankle-rims, and
the provision I had of light, paper, and implements; and though it was apparently impossible
I should break out undiscovered by both sentinels, yet had I the remaining hope of gaining
some officer, by money, who, as in Glatz, should assist my escape.

Had the commands of the King been literally obeyed escape would have been wholly impossible;
for, by this, all communication would have been totally cut off with the sentinels.  To this
effect the four keys of the four doors were each to be kept by different persons; one with
the governor, another with the town-major, the third with the major of the day, and the fourth
with the lieutenant of the guard.  I never could have found opportunity to have spoken with
any one of them singly.  These commands at first were rigidly observed, with this exception,
that the governor made his appearance only every week.  Magdeburg became so full of prisoners
that the town-major was obliged to deliver up his key to the major of the day, and the governor's
visitations wholly subsided, the citadel being an English mile and a half distant from the
Star Fort.

General Walrabe, who had been a prisoner ever since the year 1746, was also at the Star Fort,
but he had apartments, and three thousand rix-dollars a year.  The major of the day and officer
of the guard dined with him daily, and generally stayed till evening.  Either from compassion,
or a concurrence of fortunate circumstances, these gentlemen entrusted the keys to the lieutenant
on guard, by which means I could speak with each of them alone when they made their visits,
and they themselves at length sought these opportunities.  My consequent undertakings I shall
relate, with all the arts and inventions of a wretched prisoner endeavouring to escape.

Borck had selected three majors and four lieutenants for this service as those he could best
trust.  My situation was truly deplorable.  The enormous iron round my neck pained me, and
prevented motion; and I durst not attempt to disengage myself from the pendant chains till
I had, for some months, carefully observed the mode of their examination, and which parts they
supposed were perfectly secure.  The cruelty of depriving me of my bed was still greater: I
was obliged to sit upon the bare ground, and lean with my head against the damp wall.  The
chains that descended from the neck collar were obliged to be supported first with one band,
and then with the other; for, if thrown behind, they would have strangled me, and if hanging
forward occasioned most excessive headaches.  The bar between my hands held one down, while
leaning on my elbow; I supported with the other my chains; and this so benumbed the muscles
and prevented circulation, that I could perceive my arms sensibly waste away.  The little sleep
I could have in such a situation may easily be supposed, and, at length, body and mind sank
under this accumulation of miserable suffering, and I fell ill of a burning fever.

The tyrant Borck was inexorable; he wished to expedite my death, and rid himself of his troubles
and his terrors.  Here did I experience what was the lamentable condition of a sick prisoner,
without bed, refreshment, or aid from human being.  Reason, fortitude, heroism, all the noble
qualities of the mind, decay when the corporal faculties are diseased; and the remembrance
of my sufferings, at this dreadful moment, still agitates, still inflames my blood, so as almost
to prevent an attempt to describe what they were.

Yet hope had not totally forsaken me.  Deliverance seemed possible, especially should peace
ensue; and I sustained, perhaps, what mortal man never bore, except myself, being, as I was,
provided with pistols, or any such immediate mode of despatch.

I continued ill about two months, and was so reduced at last that I had scarcely strength to
lift the water-jug to my mouth.  What must the sufferings of that man be who sits two months
on the bare ground in a dungeon so damp, so dark, so horrible, without bed or straw, his limbs
loaded as mine were, with no refreshment but dry ammunition bread, without so much as a drop
of broth, without physic, without consoling friend, and who, under all these afflictions, must
trust, for his recovery, to the efforts of nature alone!

Sickness itself is sufficient to humble the mightiest mind; what, then, is sickness, with such
an addition of torment?  The burning fever, the violent headaches, my neck swelled and inflamed
with the irons, enraged me almost to madness.  The fever and the fetters together flayed my
body so that it appeared like one continued wound--Enough!  Enough!  The malefactor extended
living on the wheel, to whom the cruel executioner refuses the last stroke--the blow of death--must
yet, in some short period, expire: he suffers nothing I did not then suffer; and these, my
excruciating pangs, continued two dreadful months--Yet, can it be supposed?  There came a day!
A day of horror, when these mortal pangs were beyond imagination increased.  I sat scorched
with this intolerable fever, in which nature and death were contending; and when attempting
to quench my burning entrails with cold water, the jug dropped from my feeble hands, and broke!
I had four-and-twenty hours to remain without water.  So intolerable, so devouring was my thirst,
I could have drank human blood!  Ay, in my madness, had it been the blood of my father!

* * * * * *

Willingly would I have seized my pistols, but strength had forsaken me, I could not open the
place I was obliged to render so secure.

My visitors next day supposed me gone at last.  I lay motionless, with my tongue out of my
mouth.  They poured water down my throat, and I revived.

Oh, God!  Oh, God!  How pure, how delicious, how exquisite was this water!  My insatiable thirst
soon emptied the jug; they filled it anew, bade me farewell, hoped death would soon relieve
my mortal sufferings, and departed.

The lamentable state in which I lay at length became the subject of general conversation, that
all the ladies of the town united with the officers, and prevailed on the tyrant, Borck, to
restore me my bed.

Oh, Nature, what are thy operations?  From the day I drank water in such excess I gathered
strength, and to the astonishment of every one, soon recovered.  I had moved the heart of the
officer who inspected my prison; and after six months, six cruel months of intense misery,
the day of hope again began to dawn.

One of the majors of the day entrusted his key to Lieutenant Sonntag, who came alone, spoke
in confidence, and related his own situation, complained of his debts, his poverty, his necessities;
and I made him a present of twenty-five louis-d'ors, for which he was so grateful that our
friendship became unshaken.

The three lieutenants all commiserated me, and would sit hours with me, when a certain major
had the inspection; and he himself, after a time, would even pass half the day with me.  He,
too, was poor: and I gave him a draft for three thousand florins; hence new projects took birth.

Money became necessary; I had disbursed all I possessed, a hundred florins excepted, among
the officers.  The eldest son of Captain K---, who officiated as major, had been cashiered:
his father complained to me of his distress, and I sent him to my sister, not far from Berlin,
from whom he received a hundred ducats.  He returned and related her joy at hearing from me.
He found her exceedingly ill; and she informed me, in a few lines, that my misfortunes, and
the treachery of Weingarten, had entailed poverty upon her, and an illness which had endured
more than two years.  She wished me a happy deliverance from my chains, and, in expectation
of death, committed her children to my protection.  She, however, grew better, and married
a second time, Colonel Pape; but died in the year 1758.  I shall forbear to relate her history:
it indeed does no honour to the ashes of Frederic, and would but less dispose my own heart
to forgiveness, by reviving the memory of her oppressions and griefs.

K---n returned happy with the money: all things were concerted with the father.  I wrote to
the Countess Bestuchef, also to the Grand Duke, afterwards Peter III., recommended the young
soldier, and entreated every possible succour for myself.

K---n departed through Hamburg, for Petersburg, where, in consequence of my recommendation,
he became a captain, and in a short time major.  He took his measures so well that I, by the
intervention of his father, and a Hamburg merchant, received two thousand rubles from the Countess,
while the service he rendered me made his own fortune in Russia.

To old K---, who was as poor as he was honest, I gave three hundred ducats; and he, till death,
continued my grateful friend.  I distributed nearly as much to the other officers; and matters
proceeded so far that Lieutenant Glotin gave back the keys to the major without locking my
prison, himself passing half the night with me.  Money was given to the guard to drink; and
thus everything succeeded to my wish, and the tyrant Borck was deceived.  I had a supply of
light; had books, newspapers, and my days passed swiftly away.  I read, I wrote, I busied myself
so thoroughly that I almost forgot I was a prisoner.  When, indeed, the surly, dull blockhead,
Major Bruckhausen, had the inspection, everything had to be carefully reinstated.  Major Z---,
the second of the three, was also wholly mine.  He was particularly attached to me; for I had
promised to marry his daughter, and, should I die in prison, to bequeath him a legacy of ten
thousand florins.

Lieutenant Sonntag got false handcuffs made for me, that were so wide I could easily draw my
hands out; the lieutenants only examined my irons, the new handcuffs were made perfectly similar
to the old, and Bruckhausen had too much stupidity to remark any difference.

The remainder of my chains I could disencumber myself of at pleasure. When I exercised myself,
I held them in my hands, that the sentinel might be deceived by their clanking.  The neck-iron
was the only one I durst not remove; it was likewise too strongly riveted.  I filed through
the upper link of the pendant chain, however, by which means I could take it off, and this
I concealed with bread in the manner before mentioned.

So I could disencumber myself of most of my fetters, and sleep in ease.  I again obtained sausages
and cold meat, and thus my situation, bad as it still was, became less miserable.  Liberty,
however, was most desirable: but, alas! not one of the three lieutenants had the courage of
a Schell: Saxony, too, was in the hands of the Prussians, and flight, therefore, more dangerous.
Persuasion was in vain with men determined to risk nothing, but, if they went, to go in safety.
Will, indeed, was not wanting in Glotin and Sonntag; but the first was a poltroon, and the
latter a man of scruples, who thought this step might likewise be the ruin of his brother at
Berlin.

The sentinels were doubled, therefore my escape through my hole, which had been two years dug,
could not, unperceived by them, be effected: still less could I, in the face of the guard,
clamber the twelve feet high pallisadoes.  The following labour, therefore, though Herculean,
was undertaken.

Lieutenant Sonntag, measuring the interval between the hole I had dug and the entrance in the
gallery in the principal rampart, found it to be thirty-seven feet.  Into this it was possible
I might, by mining, penetrate.  The difficulty of the enterprise was lessened by the nature
of the ground, a fine white sand.  Could I reach the gallery my freedom was certain.  I had
been informed how many steps to the right or left must be taken, to find the door that led
to the second rampart: and, on the day when I should be ready for flight, the officer was secretly
to leave this door open.  I had light, and mining tools, and was further to rely on money and
my own discretion.

I began and continued this labour about six months.  I have already noticed the difficulty
of scraping out the earth with my hands, as the noise of instruments would have been heard
by the sentinels.  I had scarcely mined beyond my dungeon wall before I discovered the foundation
of the rampart was not more than a foot deep; a capital error certainly in so important a fortress.
My labour became the lighter, as I could remove the foundation stones of my dungeon, and was
not obliged to mine so deep.

My work at first proceeded so rapidly, that, while I had room to throw back my sand, I was
able in one night to gain three feet; but ere I had proceeded ten feet I discovered all my
difficulties.  Before I could continue my work I was obliged to make room for myself, by emptying
the sand out of my hole upon the floor of the prison, and this itself was an employment of
some hours.  The sand was obliged to be thrown out by the hand, and after it thus lay heaped
in my prison, must again be returned into the hole; and I have calculated that after I had
proceeded twenty feet, I was obliged to creep under ground, in my hole, from fifteen hundred
to two thousand fathoms, within twenty-four hours, in the removal and replacing of the sand.
This labour ended, care was to be taken that in none of the crevices of the floor there might
be any appearance of this fine white sand.  The flooring was the next to be exactly replaced,
and my chains to be resumed.  So severe was the fatigue of one day, in this mode, that I was
always obliged to rest the three following.

To reduce my labour as much as possible, I was constrained to make the passage so small that
my body only had space to pass, and I had not room to draw my arm back to my head.  The work,
too, must all be done naked, otherwise the dirtiness of my shirt must have been remarked; the
sand was wet, water being found at the depth of four feet, where the stratum of the gravel
began.  At length the expedient of sand-bags occurred to me, by which it might be removed out
and in more expeditiously.  I obtained linen from the officers, but not in sufficient quantities;
suspicions would have been excited at observing so much linen brought into the prison.  At
last I took my sheets and the ticking that enclosed my straw, and cut them up for sand-bags,
taking care to lie down on my bed, as if ill, when Bruckhausen paid his visit.

The labour, towards the conclusion, became so intolerable as to incite despondency.  I frequently
sat contemplating the heaps of sand, during a momentary respite from work; and thinking it
impossible I could have strength or time again to replace all things as they were, resolved
patiently to wait the consequence, and leave everything in its present disorder.  Yes! I can
assure the reader that, to effect concealment, I have scarcely had time in twenty-four hours
to sit down and eat a morsel of bread.  Recollecting, however, the efforts, and all the progress
I had made, hope would again revive, and exhausted strength return: again would I begin my
labours, that I might preserve my secret and my expectations: yet has it frequently happened
that my visitors have entered a few minutes after I had reinstated everything in its place.

When my work was within six or seven feet of being accomplished, a new misfortune happened
that at once frustrated all further attempts.  I worked, as I have said, under the foundation
of the rampart near where the sentinels stood.  I could disencumber myself of my fetters, except
my neck collar and its pendent chain.  This, as I worked, though it was fastened, got loose,
and the clanking was heard by one of the sentinels about fifteen feet from my dungeon.  The
officer was called, they laid their ears to the ground, and heard me as I went backward and
forward to bring my earth bags.  This was reported the next day; and the major, who was my
best friend, with the town-major, and a smith and mason, entered my prison.  I was terrified.
The lieutenant by a sign gave me to understand I was discovered.  An examination was begun,
but the officers would not see, and the smith and mason found all, as they thought, safe. Had
they examined my bed, they would have seen the ticking and sheets were gone.

The town-major, who was a dull man, was persuaded the thing was impossible, and said to the
sentinel, "Blockhead! you have heard some mole underground, and not Trenck.  How, indeed, could
it be, that lee should work underground, at such a distance from his dungeon?"  Here the scrutiny
ended.

There was now no time for delay.  Had they altered their hour of coming, they must have found
me at work: but this, during ten years, never happened: for the governor and town-major were
stupid men, and the others, poor fellows, wishing me all success, were willingly blind.  In
a few days I could have broken out, but, when ready, I was desirous to wait for the visitation
of the man who had treated me so tyranically, Bruckhausen, that his own negligence might be
evident.  But this man, though he wanted understanding, did not want good fortune.  He was
ill for some time, and his duty devolved on K---.

He recovered; and the visitation being over, the doors were no sooner barred than I began my
supposed last labour.  I had only three feet farther to proceed, and it was no longer necessary
I should bring out the sand, I having room to throw it behind me.  What my anxiety was, what
my exertions were, may well be imagined.  My evil genius, however, had decreed that the same
sentinel, who had heard me before, should be that day on guard.  He was piqued by vanity, to
prove he was not the blockhead he had been called; he therefore again laid his ear to the ground,
and again heard me burrowing.  Ho called his comrades first, next thee major; lee came, and
heard me likewise; they then went without the pallisadoes, and heard me working near the door,
at which place I was to break into the gallery.  This door they immediately opened, entered
the gallery with lanthorns, and waited to catch the hunted fox when unearthed.

Through the first small breach I made I perceived a light, and saw the heads of those who were
expecting me.  This was indeed a thunder-stroke! I crept back, made my way through the sand
I had cast behind me, and awaited my fate with shuddering!  I had the presence of mind to conceal
my pistols, candles, paper, and some money, under the floor which I could remove.  The money
was disposed of in various holes, well concealed also between the panels of the doors; and
under different cracks in the floor I hid my small files and knives.  Scarcely were these disposed
of before the doors resounded: the floor was covered with sand and sand-bags: my handcuffs,
however, and the separating bar, I had hastily resumed that they might suppose I had worked
with them on, which they were silly enough to credit, highly to my future advantage.

No man was more busy on this occasion than the brutal and stupid Bruckhausen, who put many
interrogatories, to which I made no reply, except assuring him that I should have completed
my work some days sooner, had it not been his good fortune to fall sick, and that this only
had been the cause of my failure.

The man was absolutely terrified with apprehension; he began to fear me, grew more polite,
and even supposed nothing was impossible to me.

It was too late to remove the sand; therefore the lieutenant and guard continued with me, so
that this night at least I did not want company. When the morning came, the hole was first
filled up; the planking was renewed.  The tyrant Borck was ill, and could not come, otherwise
my treatment would have been still more lamentable.  The smiths had ended before the evening,
and the irons were heavier than ever.  The foot chains, instead of being fastened as before,
were screwed and riveted; all else remained as formerly.  They were employed in the flooring
till the next day, so that I could not sleep, and at last I sank down with weariness.

The greatest of my misfortunes was they again deprived me of my bed, because I had cut it up
for sand-bags.  Before the doors were barred Bruckhausen and another major examined my body
very narrowly.  They often had asked me where I concealed all my implements?  My answer was,
"Gentlemen, Beelzebub is my best and most intimate friend; he brings me everything I want,
supplies me with light: we play whole nights at piquet, and, guard me as you please, he will
finally deliver me out of your power."

Some were astonished, others laughed.  At length, as they were barring the last door, I called,
"Come back, gentlemen! you have forgotten something of great importance."  In the interim I
had taken up one of my hidden files.  When they returned, "Look ye, gentlemen," said I, "here
is a proof of the friendship Beelzebub has for me, he has brought me this in a twinkling."
Again they examined, and again they shut their doors. While they were so doing, I took out
a knife, and ten louis-d'ors, called, and they re turned, grumbling curses; I then shewed the
knife and the louis-d'ors.  Their consternation was excessive; and I diverted my misfortunes
by jesting at such blundering, short-sighted keepers.  It was soon rumoured through Magdeburg,
especially among the simple and vulgar, that I was a magician to whom the devil brought all
I asked.

One Major Holtzkammer, a very selfish man, profited by this report.  A foolish citizen had
offered him fifty dollars if he might only be permitted to see me through the door, being very
desirous to see a wizard.  Holtzkammer told me, and we jointly determined to sport with his
credulity.  The major gave me a mask with a monstrous nose, which I put on when the doors were
opening, and threw myself in an heroic attitude. The affrighted burger drew back; but Holtzkammer
stopped him, and said, "Have patience for some quarter of an hour, and you shall see he will
assume quite a different countenance."  The burger waited, my mask was thrown by, and my face
appeared whitened with chalk, and made ghastly. The burger again shrank back; Holtzkammer kept
him in conversation, and I assumed a third farcical form.  I tied my hair under my nose, and
a pewter dish to my breast, and when the door a third time opened, I thundered, "Begone, rascals,
or I'll set your necks--awry!"  They both ran: and the silly burger, eased of his fifty dollars,
scampered first.

The major, in vain, laid his injunctions on the burger never to reveal what he had beheld,
it being a breach of duty in him to admit any persons whatever to the sight of me.  In a few
days, the necromancer Trenck was the theme of every alehouse in Magdeburg, and the person was
named who had seen me change my form thrice in the space of one hour.  Many false and ridiculous
circumstances were added, and at last the story reached the governor's ears.  The citizen was
cited, and offered to take his oath of what himself and the major had seen.  Holtzkammer accordingly
suffered a severe reprimand, and was some days under arrest.  We frequently laughed, however,
at this adventure, which had rendered me so much the subject of conversation.  Miraculous reports
were the more easily credited, because no one could comprehend how, in despite of the load
of irons I carried, and all the vigilance of my guards, I should be continually able to make
new attempts, while those appointed to examine my dungeon seemed, as it were, blinded and bewildered.
A proof this, how easy it is to deceive the credulous, and whence have originated witchcraft,
prophecies, and miracles.

CHAPTER IV.

My last undertaking had employed me more than twelve months, and so weakened me that I appeared
little better than a skeleton. Notwithstanding the greatness of my spirit, I should have sunk
into despondency, at seeing an end like this to all my labours, had I not still cherished a
secret hope of escaping, founded on the friends I had gained among the officers.

I soon felt the effects of the loss of my bed, and was a second time attacked by a violent
fever, which would this time certainly have consumed me had not the officers, unknown to the
governor, treated me with all possible compassion.  Bruckhausen alone continued my enemy, and
the slave of his orders; on his day of examination rules and commands in all their rigour were
observed, nor durst I free myself from my irons, till I had for some weeks remarked those parts
on which he invariably fixed his attention.  I then cut through the link, and closed up the
vacancy with bread.  My hands I could always draw out, especially after illness had consumed
the flesh off my bones.  Half a year had elapsed before I had recovered sufficient strength
to undertake, anew, labours like the past.

Necessity at length taught me the means of driving Bruckhausen from my dungeon, and of inducing
him to commit his office to another.  I learnt his olfactory nerves were somewhat delicate,
and whenever I heard the doors unbar, I took care to make a stir in my night-table.  This made
him give back, and at length he would come no farther than the door.  Such are the hard expedients
of a poor unhappy prisoner!

One day he came, bloated with pride, just after a courier had brought the news of victory,
and spoke of the Austrians, and the august person of the Empress-Queen with so much virulence,
that, at last, enraged almost to madness, I snatched the sword of an officer from its sheath,
and should certainly have ended him, had he not made a hasty retreat.  From that day forward
he durst no more come without guards to examine the dungeon.  Two men always preceded him,
with their bayonets fixed, and their pieces presented, behind whom he stood at the door.  This
was another fortunate incident, as I dreaded only his examination.

The following anecdote will afford a specimen of this man's understanding.  While digging in
the earth I found a cannon-ball, and laid it in the middle of my prison.  When he came to examine--"What
in the name of God is that?" said he.  "It is a part of the ammunition," answered I, "that
my Familiar brings me.  The cannon will be here anon, and you will then see fine sport!"  He
was astonished, told this to others, nor could conceive such a ball might by any natural means
enter my prison.

I wrote a satire on him, when the late Landgrave of Hesse-Cassel was governor of Magdeburg;
and I had permission to write as will hereafter appear: the Landgrave gave it to him to read
himself; and so gross was his conception, that though his own phraseology was introduced, part
of his history and his character painted, yet he did not perceive the jest, but laughed heartily
with the hearers.  The Landgrave was highly diverted, and after I obtained my freedom, restored
me the manuscript written in my own blood.

About the time that my last attempt at escaping failed, General Krusemarck came to my prison,
whom I had formerly lived with in habits of intimacy, when cornet of the body guard.  Without
testifying friendship, esteem, or compassion, he asked, among other things, in an authoritative
tone, how I could employ my time to prevent tediousness?  I answered in as haughty a mood as
he interrogated: for never could misfortune bend my mind.  I told him, "I always could find
sources of entertainment in my own thoughts; and that, as for my dreams, I imagined they would
at least be as peaceful and pleasant as those of my oppressors."  "Had you in time," replied
he, "curbed this fervour of yours, had you asked pardon of the King, perhaps you would have
been in very different circumstances; but he who has committed an offence in which he obstinately
persists, endeavouring only to obtain freedom by seducing men from their duty, deserves no
better fate."

Justly was my anger roused!  "Sir," answered I, "you are a general of the King of Prussia,
I am an Austrian captain.  My royal mistress will protect, perhaps deliver me, or, at least,
revenge my death; I have a conscience void of reproach.  You, yourself, well know I have not
deserved these chains.  I place my hope in time, and the justness of my cause, calumniated
and condemned, as I have been, without legal sentence or hearing.  In such a situation, the
philosopher will always be able to brave and despise the tyrant."

He departed with threats, and his last words were, "The bird shall soon be taught to sing another
tune."  The effects of this courteous visit were soon felt.  An order came that I should be
prevented sleeping, and that the sentinels should call, and wake me every quarter of an hour;
which dreadful order was immediately executed.

This was indeed a punishment intolerable to nature!  Yet did custom at length teach me to answer
in my sleep.  Four years did this unheard of cruelty continue!  The noble Landgrave of Hesse-Cassel
at length put an end to it a year before I was released from my dungeon, and once again, in
mercy, suffered me to sleep in peace.

Under this new affliction, I wrote an Elegy which may be found in the second volume of my works,
a few lines of which I shall cite.

   Wake me, ye guards, for hark, the quarter strikes!
   Sport with my woes, laugh loud at my miseries
   Hearken if you hear my chains clank!  Knock!  Beat!
   Of an inexorable tyrant be ye
   Th' inexorable instruments!  Wake me, ye slaves;
   Ye do but as you're bade.  Soon shall he lie
   Sleepless, or dreaming, the spectres of conscience
   Behold and shriek, who me deprives of rest.

      Wake me: Again the quarter strikes!  Call loud
   Rip up all my bleeding wounds, and shrink not!
   Yet think 'tis I that answer, God that hears!
   To every wretch in chains sleep is permitted:
   I, I alone, am robb'd of this last refuge
   Of sinking nature!  Hark!  Again they thunder!
   Again they iterate yells of Trenck and death.

   Peace to thy anger, peace, thou suffering heart!
   Nor indignant beat, adding tenfold pangs to pain.

      Ye burthened limbs, arise from momentary
   Slumbers!  Shake your chains!  Murmur not, but rise!
   And ye!  Watch-dogs of Power! let loose your rage:
   Fear not, for I am helpless, unprotected.
   And yet, not so--The noble mind, within
   Itself, resources finds innumerable.

   Thou, Oh God, thought'st good me t' imprison thus:
   Thou, Oh God, in Thy good time, wilt me deliver.

      Wake me then, nor fear!  My soul slumbers not.
   And who can say but those who fetter me,
   May, ere to-morrow, groan themselves in fetters!
   Wake me!  For lo! their sleep's less sweet than mine.

   Call!  Call!  From night to morn, from twilight to dawn,
   Incessant!  Yea, in God's name, Call!  Call!  Call!
   Amen!  Amen!  Thy will, Oh God, be done!
   Yet surely Thou at length shalt hear my sighs!
   Shalt burst my prison doors!  Shalt shew me fair
   Creation!  Yea, the very heav'n of heav'ns!

With whom these orders originated, unexampled in the history even of tyranny, I shall not venture
to say.  The major, who was my friend, advised me to persist in not answering.  I followed
his advice; and it produced this good effect that we mutually forced each other to a capitulation:
they restored me my bed, and I was obliged to reply.

Immediately after this regulation, the sub-governor, General Borck, my bitter enemy, became
insane, was dispossessed of his post, and Lieutenant- General Reichmann, the benevolent friend
of humanity, was made sub-governor.

About the same time the Court fled from Berlin, and the Queen, the Prince of Prussia, the Princess
Amelia, and the Margrave Henry, chose Magdeburg for their residence.  Bruckhausen grew more
polite, probably perceiving I was not wholly deserted, and that it was yet possible I might
obtain my freedom.  The cruel are usually cowards, and there is reason to suppose Bruckhausen
was actuated by his fears to treat me with greater respect.

The worthy new governor had not indeed the power to lighten my chains, or alter the general
regulations; what he could, he did.  If he did not command, he connived at the doors being
occasionally at first, and at length, daily, kept open some hours, to admit daylight and fresh
air. After a time, they were open the whole day, and only closed by the officers when they
returned from their visit to Walrabe.

Having light, I began to carve, with a nail, on the pewter cup in which I drank, satirical
verses and various figures, and attained so much perfection that my cups, at last, were considered
as master-pieces, both of engraving and invention, and were sold dear, as rare curiosities.
My first attempts were rude, as may well be imagined.  My cup was carried to town, and shown
to visitors by the governor, who sent me another.  I improved, and each of the inspecting officers
wished to possess one.  I grew more expert, and spent a whole year in this employment, which
thus passed swiftly away.  The perfection I had now acquired obtained me the permission of
candle-light, and this continued till I was restored to freedom.

The King gave orders these cups should all be inspected by government, because I wished, by
my verses and devices, to inform the world of my fate.  But this command was not obeyed; the
officers made merchandise of my cups, and sold them at last for twelve ducats each.  Their
value increased so much, when I was released from prison, that they are now to be found in
various museums throughout Europe.  Twelve years ago the late Landgrave of Hesse-Cassel presented
one of them to my wife; and another came, in a very unaccountable manner, from the Queen-Dowager
of Prussia to Paris.  I have given prints of both these, with the verses they contained, in
my works; whence it may be seen how artificially they were engraved.

A third fell into the hands of Prince Augustus Lobkowitz, then a prisoner of war at Magdeburg,
who, on his return to Vienna, presented it to the Emperor, who placed it in his museum.  Among
other devices on this cup, was a landscape, representing a vineyard and husbandmen, and under
it the following words:--By my labours my vineyard flourished, and I hoped to have gathered
the fruit; but Ahab came.  Alas! for Naboth.

The allusion was so pointed, both to the wrongs done me in Vienna, and my sufferings in Prussia,
that it made a very strong impression on the Empress-Queen, who immediately commanded her minister
to make every exertion for my deliverance.  She would probably at last have even restored me
to my estates, had not the possessors of them been so powerful, or had she herself lived one
year longer.  To these my engraved cups was I indebted for being once more remembered at Vienna.
On the same cup, also, was another engraving of a bird in a cage, held by a Turk, with the
following inscription:--The bird sings even in the storm; open his cage, break his fetters,
ye friends of virtue, and his songs shall be the delight of your abodes!

There is another remarkable circumstance attending these cups.  All were forbidden under pain
of death to hold conversation with me, or to supply me with pen and ink; yet by this open permission
of writing what I pleased on pewter, was I enabled to inform the world of all I wished, and
to prove a man of merit was oppressed.  The difficulties of this engraving will be conceived,
when it is remembered that I worked by candle-light on shining pewter, attained the art of
giving light and shade, and by practice could divide a cup into two-and-thirty compartments
as regularly with a stroke of the hand as with a pair of compasses.  The writing was so minute
that it could only be read with glasses.  I could use but one hand, both, being separated by
the bar, and therefore held the cup between my knees.  My sole instrument was a sharpened nail,
yet did I write two lines on the rim only.

My labour became so excessive, that I was in danger of distraction or blindness.  Everybody
wished for cups, and I wished to oblige everybody, so that I worked eighteen hours a day. 
The reflection of the light from the pewter was injurious to my eyes, and the labour of invention
for apposite subjects and verses was most fatiguing.  I had learnt only architectural drawing.

Enough of these cups, which procured me so much honour, so many advantages, and helped to shorten
so many mournful hours.  My greatest encumbrance was the huge iron collar, with its enormous
appendages, which, when suffered to press the arteries in the back of my neck, occasioned intolerable
headaches.  I sat too much, and a third time fell sick.  A Brunswick sausage, secretly given
me by a friend, occasioned an indigestion, which endangered my life; a putrid fever followed,
and my body was reduced to a skeleton.  Medicines, however, were conveyed to me by the officers,
and, now and then, warm food.

After my recovery, I again thought it necessary to endeavour to regain my liberty.  I had but
forty louis-d'ors remaining, and these I could not get till I had first broken up the flooring.

Lieutenant Sonntag was consumptive, and obtained his discharge.  I supplied bins with money
to defray the expenses of his journey, and with an order that four hundred florins should be
annually paid him from my effects till his death or my release.  I commissioned him to seek
an audience from the Empress, endeavour to excite her compassion in my behalf, and to remit
me four thousand florins, for which I gave a proper acquittance, by the way of Hamburgh.  The
money-draft was addressed to my administrators, Counsellors Kempf and Huttner.

But no one, alas! in Vienna, wished my return; they had already begun to share my property,
of which they never rendered me an account.  Poor Sonntag was arrested as a spy, imprisoned,
ill treated for some weeks, and, at last, when naked and destitute, received a hundred florins,
and was escorted beyond the Austrian confines.  The worthy man fell a shameful sacrifice to
his honesty, could never obtain an audience of the Empress, and returned poor and miserable
on foot to Berlin, where he was twelve months secretly maintained by his brother, and with
whom he died. He wrote an account of all this to the good Knoblauch, my Hamburgh agent, and
I, from my small store, sent him a hundred ducats.

How much must I despair of finding any place of refuge on earth, hearing accounts like these
from Vienna.

A friend, whom I will never name, by the aid of one of the lieutenants, secretly visited me,
and supplied me with six hundred ducats.  The same friend, in the year 1763, paid four thousand
florins to the imperial envoy, Baron Reidt, at Berlin, for the furthering of my freedom, as
I shall presently more fully show.  Thus I had once more money.

About this time the French army advanced to within five miles of Magdeburg.  This important
fortress was, at that time, the key of the whole Prussian power.  It required a garrison of
sixteen thousand men, and contained not more than fifteen hundred.  The French might have marched
in unopposed, and at once have put an end to the war.  The officers brought me all the news,
and my hopes rose as they approached. What was my astonishment when the major informed me that
three waggons had entered the town in the night, had been sent back loaded with money, and
that the French were retreating.  This, I can assure my readers, on my honour, is literally
truth, to the eternal disgrace of the French general.  The major, who informed me, was himself
an eye-witness of the fact.  It was pretended the money was for the army of the King, but everybody
could guess whither it was going; it left the town without a convoy, and the French were then
in the neighbourhood.  Such were the allies of Maria Theresa; the receivers of this money are
known in Paris. Not only were my hopes this way frustrated, but in Russia likewise, where the
Countess of Bestuchef and the Chancellor had fallen into disgrace.

I now imagined another, and, indeed, a fearful and dangerous project.  The garrison of Magdeburg
at this moment consisted but of nine hundred militia, who were discontented men.  Two majors
and two lieutenants were in my interest.  The guard of the Star Fort amounted but to a hundred
and fifteen men.  Fronting the gate of this fort was the town gate, guarded only by twelve
men and an inferior officer; beside these lay the casemates, in which were seven thousand Croat
prisoners.  Baron K---y, a captain, and prisoner of war, also was in our interest, and would
hold his comrades ready at a certain place and time to support my undertaking. Another friend
was, under some pretence, to hold his company ready, with their muskets loaded, and the plan
was such that I should have had four hundred men in arms ready to carry it into execution.

The officer was to have placed the two men we most suspected and feared, as sentinels over
me; he was to command them to take away my bed, and when encumbered, I was to spring out, and
shut them in the prison. Clothing and arms were to have been procured, and brought me into
my prison; the town-gate was to have been surprised; I was to have run to the casemate, and
called to the Croats, "Trenck to arms!"  My friends, at the same instant, were to break forth,
and the plan was so well concerted that it could not have failed.  Magdeburg, the magazine
of the army, the royal treasury, arsenal, all would have been mine; and sixteen thousand men,
who were then prisoners of war, would have enabled me to keep possession.

The most essential secret, by which all this was to have been effected, I dare not reveal;
suffice it to say, everything was provided for, everything made secure; I shall only add that
the garrison, in the harvest months, was exceedingly weakened, because the farmers paid the
captains a florin per man each day, and the men for their labour likewise, to obtain hands.
The sub-governor connived at the practice.

One Lieutenant G--- procured a furlough to visit his friends; but, supplied by me with money,
he went to Vienna.  I furnished him with a letter, addressed to Counsellors Kempf and Huttner,
including a draft for two thousand ducats; wherein I said that, by these means, I should not
only soon be at liberty, but in possession of the fortress of Magdeburg; and that the bearer
was entrusted with the rest.

The lieutenant came safe to Vienna, underwent a thousand interrogatories, and his name was
repeatedly asked.  This, fortunately, he concealed.  They advised him not to be concerned in
so dangerous an undertaking; told him I had not so much money due to me, and gave him, instead
of two thousand ducats, one thousand florins.  With these he left Vienna, but with very prudent
suspicions which prevented him ever returning to Magdeburg.  A month had scarcely passed before
the late Landgrave of Hesse-Cassel, then chief governor, entered my prison, showed me my letter,
and demanded to know who had carried the letter, and who were to free me and betray Magdeburg.
Whether the letter was sent immediately to the King or the governor I know not; it is sufficient
that I was once more betrayed at Vienna.  The truth was, the administrators of my effects had
acted as if I were deceased, and did not choose to refund two thousand ducats.  They wished
not I should obtain my freedom, in a manner that would have obliged the government to have
rewarded me, and restore the effects they had embezzled and the estates they had seized.  What
happened afterwards at Vienna, which will be related in its place, will incontestably prove
this surmise to be well founded.

These bad men did not, it is true, die in the manner they ought, but they are all dead, and
I am still living, an honest, though poor man: they did not die so.  Be this read and remembered
by their luxurious heirs, who refuse to restore my children to their rights.

CHAPTER V.

My consternation on the appearance of the Landgrave, with my letter in his hand, may well be
supposed; I had the presence of mind, however, to deny my handwriting, and affect astonishment
at so crafty a trick.  The Landgrave endeavoured to convict me, told me what Lieutenant Kemnitz
had repeated at Vienna concerning my possessing myself of Magdeburg, and thereby showed me
how fully I had been betrayed.  But as no such person existed as Lieutenant Kemnitz, and as
my friend had fortunately concealed his name, the mystery remained impenetrable, especially
as no one could conceive how a prisoner, in my situation, could seduce or subdue the whole
garrison.  The worthy prince left my prison, apparently satisfied with my defence; his heart
felt no satisfaction in the misfortunes of others.

The next day a formal examination was taken, at which the sub-governor Reichmann presided.
I was accused as a traitor to my country; but I obstinately denied my handwriting.  Proofs
or witnesses there were none, and in answer to the principal charge, I said, "I was no criminal,
but a man calumniated, illegally imprisoned, and loaded with irons; that the King, in the year
1746, had cashiered me, and confiscated my parental inheritance; that therefore the laws of
nature enforced me to seek honour and bread in a foreign service; and that, finding these in
Austria, I became an officer and a faithful subject of the Empress-Queen; that I had been a
second time unoffendingly imprisoned; that here I was treated as the worst of malefactors,
and my only resource was to seek my liberty by such means as I could; were I therefore in this
attempt to destroy Magdeburg, and occasion the loss of a thousand lives, I should still be
guiltless.  Had I been heard and legally sentenced, previous to my imprisonment at Glatz, I
should have been, and still continued, a criminal; but not having been guilty of any small,
much less of any great crime, equal to my punishment, if such crime could be, I was therefore
not accountable for consequences; I owed neither fidelity nor duty to the King of Prussia;
for by the word of his power he had deprived me of bread, honour, country, and freedom."

Here the examination ended, without further discovery; the officers, however, falling under
suspicion, were all removed, and thus I lost my best friends; yet it was not long before I
had gained two others, which was no difficult matter, as I knew the national character, and
that none but poor men were made militia officers.  Thus was the governor's precaution fruitless,
and almost everybody secretly wished I might obtain my freedom.

I shall never forget the noble manner in which I was treated on this occasion by the Landgrave.
This I personally acknowledged, some years afterwards, in the city of Cassel, when I heard
many things which confirmed all my surmises concerning Vienna.  The Landgrave received me with
all grace, favour, and distinction.  I revere his memory, and seek to honour his name.  He
was the friend of misfortune.  When I not long afterwards fell ill, he sent me his own physician,
and meat from his table, nor would he suffer me, during two months, to be wakened by the sentinels.
He likewise removed the dreadful collar from my neck; for which he was severely reprimanded
by the King, as he himself has since assured me.

I might fill a volume with incidents attending two other efforts to escape, but I will not
weary the reader's patience with too much repetition.  I shall merely give an abstract of both.

When I had once more gained the officers, I made a new attempt at mining my way out.  Not wanting
for implements, my chains and the flooring were soon cut through, and all was so carefully
replaced that I was under no fear of examination.  I here found my concealed money, pistols,
and other necessaries, but till I had rid myself of some hundredweight of sand, it was impossible
to proceed.  For this purpose I made two different openings in the floor: out of the real hole
I threw a great quantity of sand into my prison; after which I closed it with all possible
care.  I then worked at the second with so much noise, that I was certain they must hear me
without.  About midnight the doors began to thunder, and in they came, detecting me, as I intended
they should.  None of them could conceive why I should wish to break out under the door, where
there was a triple guard to pass.  The sentinels remained, and in the morning prisoners were
sent to wheel away the sand.  The hole was walled up and boarded, and my fetters were renewed.
They laughed at the ridiculousness of my undertaking, but punished me by depriving me of my
light and bed, which, however, in a fortnight were both restored.  Of the other hole, out of
which most of the earth had been thrown, no one was aware.  The major and lieutenant were too
much my friends to remark that they had removed thrice the quantity of sand the false opening
could contain.  They supposed this strange attempt having failed, it would be my last, and
Bruckhausen grew negligent.

The governor and sub-governor both visited me after some weeks, but far from imitating the
brutality of Borck, the Landgrave spoke to me with mildness, promised me his interest to regain
my freedom, when peace should be concluded; told me I had more friends than I supposed, and
assured me I had not been forgotten by the Court at Vienna.

He promised me every alleviation, and I gave him my word I would no more attempt to escape
while he remained governor.  My manner enforced conviction and he ordered my neck-collar to
be taken off, my window to be unclosed, my doors to be left open two hours every day, a stove
to be put in my dungeon, finer linen for my shirts, and paper to amuse myself by writing my
thoughts.  The sheets were to be numbered when given, and then returned, by the town-major,
that I might not abuse this liberty.

Ink was not allowed me, I therefore pricked my fingers, suffered the blood to trickle into
a pot; by these means I procured a substitute for ink, both to write and draw.

I now engraved my cups, and versified.  I had opportunity to display my abilities to awaken
compassion.  My emulation was increased by knowing that my works were seen at Courts, that
the Princess Amelia and the Queen herself testified their satisfaction.  I had subjects to
engrave from sent me; and the wretch whom the King intended to bury alive, whose name no man
was to mention, never was more famous than while he vented his groans in his dungeon.  My writings
produced their effect, and really regained my freedom.  To my cultivation of the sciences and
presence of mind I am indebted for all; these all the power of Frederic could not deprive me
of.  Yes!  This liberty I procured, though he answered all petitions in my behalf--"He is a
dangerous man: and so long as I live he shall never see the light!"  Yet have I seen it during
his life: after his death I have seen it without revenging myself, otherwise than by proving
my virtue to a monarch who oppressed because he knew me not, because he would not recall the
hasty sentence of anger, or own he might be mistaken.  He died convinced of my integrity, yet
without affording me retribution!  Man is formed by misfortune; virtue is active in adversity.
It is indifferent to me that the companions of my youth have their ears gratified, delighted
with the titles of General!  Field-Marshal I have learned to live without such additions; I
am known in my works.

I returned to my dungeon.  Here, after my last conference with the Landgrave, I waited my fate
with a mind more at ease than that of a prince in a palace.  The newspapers they brought me
bespoke approaching peace, on which my dependence was placed, and I passed eighteen months
calmly, and without further attempt to escape.

The father of the Landgrave died; and Magdeburg now lost its governor. The worthy Reichmann,
however, testified for me all compassion and esteem; I had books, and my time was employed.
Imprisonment and chains to me were become habitual, and freedom in hope approached.

About this time I wrote the poems, "The Macedonian Hero," "The Dream Realised," and some fables.
The best of my poems are now lost to me.  The mind's sensibility when the body is imprisoned
is strongly roused, nor can all the aids of the library equal this advantage.  Perhaps I may
recover some in Berlin; if so, the world may learn what my thoughts then were.  When I was
at liberty, I had none but such as I remembered, and these I committed to writing.  On my first
visit to the Landgrave of Hesse-Cassel I received a volume of them written in my own blood;
but there were eight of these which I shall never regain.

The death of Elizabeth, the deposing of Peter III., and the accession of Catherine II. produced
peace.  On the receipt of this intelligence I tried to provide for all contingencies.  The
worthy Captain K--- had opened me a correspondence with Vienna: I was assured of support; but
was assured the administrators and those who possessed my estates would throw every impediment
in the way of freedom.  I tried to persuade another officer to aid my escape, but in vain.

I therefore opened my old hole, and my friends assisted me to disembarrass myself of sand.
My money melted away, but they provided me with tools, gunpowder, and a good sword.  I had
remained so long quiet that my flooring was not examined.

My intent was to wait the peace; and should I continue in chains, then would I have my subterranean
passage to the rampart ready for escape.  For my further security, an old lieutenant had purchased
a house in the suburbs, where I might lie concealed.  Gummern, in Saxony, is two miles from
Magdeburg; here a friend, with two good horses, was to wait a year, to ride on the glacis of
Klosterbergen on the first and fifteenth of each month, and at a given signal to hasten to
my assistance.

My passage had to be ready in case of emergency; I removed the upper planking, broke up the
two beds, cut the boards into chips, and burnt them in my stove.  By this I obtained so much
additional room as to proceed half way with my mine.  Linen again was brought me, sand-bags
made, and thus I successfully proceeded to all but the last operation. Everything was so well
concealed that I had nothing to fear from inspection, especially as the new come garrison could
not know what was the original length of the planks.

I must here relate a dreadful accident, which I cannot remember without shuddering, and the
terror of which has often haunted my very dreams.

While mining under the rampart, as I was carrying out the sand-bag, I struck my foot against
a stone which fell down and closed up the passage.

What was my horror to find myself buried alive!  After a short reflection, I began to work
the sand away from the side, that I might turn round.  There were some feet of empty space,
into which I threw the sand as I worked it away; but the small quantity of air soon made it
so foul that I a thousand times wished myself dead, and made several attempts to strangle myself.
Thirst almost deprived me of my senses, but as often as I put my mouth to the sand I inhaled
fresh air.  My sufferings were incredible, and I imagine I passed eight hours in this situation.
My spirits fainted; again I recovered and began to labour, but the earth was as high as my
chin, and I had no more space where I might throw the sand.  I made a more desperate effort,
drew my body into a ball, and turned round; I now faced the stone; there being an opening at
the top, I respired fresher air.  I rooted away the sand under the stone, and let it sink so
that I might creep over; at length I once more arrived in my dungeon!

The morning was advanced; I sat down so exhausted that I supposed it was impossible I had strength
to conceal my hole.  After half an hour's rest, my fortitude returned: again I went to work,
and scarcely had I ended before my visitors approached.

They found me pale: I complained of headache, and continued some days affected by the fatigue
I had sustained.  After a time strength returned; but perhaps of all my nights of horror this
was the most horrible.  I repeatedly dreamt I was buried in the centre of the earth; and now,
though three and twenty years are elapsed, my sleep is still haunted by this vision.

After this accident, when I worked in my cavity, I hung a knife round my neck, that if I should
be enclosed I might shorten my miseries.  Over the stone that had fallen several others hung
tottering, under which I was obliged to creep.  Nothing, however, could deter me from trying
to obtain my liberty.

When my passage was ready, I wrote letters to my friends at Vienna, and also a memorial to
my Sovereign.  When the militia left Magdeburg and the regulars returned, I took leave of my
friends who had behaved so benevolently.  Several weeks elapsed before they departed and I
learnt that General Reidt was appointed ambassador from Vienna to Berlin.

I had seen the world; I knew this General was not averse to a bribe: I wrote him a letter,
conjuring him to act with ardour in my behalf.  I enclosed a draft for six thousand florins
on my effects at Vienna, and he received four thousand from one of my relations.  I have to
thank these ten thousand florins for my freedom, which I obtained nine months after. My vouchers
show the six thousand florins were paid in April, 1763, to the order of General Reidt.  The
other four thousand I repaid, when at liberty, to my friend.

I received intelligence before the garrison departed that no stipulation had been made on my
behalf at the peace of Hubertsberg.  The Vienna plenipotentiaries, after the articles were
signed, mentioned my name to Hertzberg, with but few assurances of every effort being made
to move Frederic, a promise on which I could much better rely than on my protectors at Vienna,
who had left me in misfortune.  I determined to wait three months longer, and should I still
find myself neglected, to owe my escape to myself.

On the change of the garrison, the officers were more difficult to gain than the former.  The
majors obeyed their orders; their help was unnecessary; but still I sighed for my old friends.
I had only ammunition-bread again for food.

My time hung very heavy; everything was examined on the change of the garrison.  A stricter
scrutiny might occur, and my projects be discovered.  This had nearly been effected, as I shall
here relate.  I had so tamed a mouse that it would eat from my mouth; in this small animal
I discovered proofs of intelligence.

This mouse had nearly been my ruin.  I had diverted myself with it one night; it had been nibbling
at my door and capering on a trencher.  The sentinels hearing our amusement, called the officers:
they heard also, and thought all was not right.  At daybreak the town-major, a smith, and mason
entered; strict search was begun; flooring, walls, chains, and my own person were all scrutinised,
but in vain.  They asked what was the noise they had heard; I mentioned the mouse, whistled,
and it came and jumped upon my shoulder.  Orders were given I should be deprived of its society;
I entreated they would spare its life.  The officer on guard gave me his word he would present
it to a lady, who would treat it with tenderness.

He took it away and turned it loose in the guardroom, but it was tame to me alone, and sought
a hiding place.  It had fled to my prison door, and, at the hour of visitation, ran into my
dungeon, testifying its joy by leaping between my legs.  It is worthy of remark that it had
been taken away blindfold, that is to say, wrapped in a handkerchief.  The guard- room was
a hundred paces from the dungeon.

All were desirous of obtaining this mouse, but the major carried it off for his lady; she put
it into a cage, where it pined, and in a few days died.

The loss of this companion made me quite melancholy, yet, on the last examination, I perceived
it had so eaten the bread by which I had concealed the crevices I had made in cutting the floor,
that the examiners must be blind not to discover them.  I was convinced my faithful little
friend had fallen a necessary victim to its master's safety.  This accident determined me not
to wait the three months.

I have related that horses were to be kept ready, on the first and fifteenth, and I only suffered
the first of August to pass, because I would not injure Major Pfuhl, who had treated me with
more compassion than his comrades, and whose day of visitation it was.  On the fifteenth I
determined to fly.  This resolution formed, I waited in expectation of the day, when a new
and remarkable succession of accidents happened.

An alarm of fire had obliged the major to repair to the town; he committed the keys to the
lieutenant.  The latter, coming to visit me, asked--"Dear Trenck, have you never, during seven
years that you have been under the guard of the militia, found a man like Schell?"  "Alas!
sir," answered I, "such friends are rare; the will of many has been good; each knew I could
make his fortune, but none had courage enough for so desperate an attempt!  Money I have distributed
freely, but have received little help."

"How do you obtain money in this dungeon?"  "From a correspondent at Vienna, by whom I am still
supplied."  "If I can serve you, command me: I will do it without asking any return."  So saying,
I took fifty ducats from between the panels, and gave them to the lieutenant.  At first he
refused, but at length accepted them with fear.  He left me, promised to return, pretended
to shut the door, and kept his word.  He now said debt obliged him to desert; that this had
long been his determination, and that, desirous to assist me at the same time if he could find
the means, I had only to show how this might be effected.

We continued two hours in conference: a plan was formed, approved, and a certainty of success
demonstrated; especially when I told him I had two horses waiting.  We vowed eternal friendship;
I gave him fifty ducats, and his debts, not amounting to more than two hundred rix-dollars,
which he never could have discharged out of his pay.

He was to prepare four keys to resemble those of my dungeon; the latter were to be exchanged
on the day of flight, being kept in the guard-room while the major was with General Walrabe.
He was to give the grenadiers on guard leave of absence, or send them into the town on various
pretences.  The sentinels he was to call from their duty, and those placed over me were to
be sent into my dungeon to take away my bed; while encumbered with this, I was to spring out
and lock them in, after which we were to mount our horses, which were kept ready, and ride
to Gummern. Every thing was to be prepared within a week, when he was to mount guard. We had
scarcely formed our project before the sentinels called the major was coming; he accordingly
barred the door, and the major passed to General Walrabe.

No man was happier than myself; my hopes of escape were triple; the mediation at Berlin, the
mine I had made, and my friend the lieutenant.

When most my mind ought to have been clear, I seemed to have lost my understanding.  I came
to a resolution which will appear extravagant and pitiable.  I was stupid enough, mad enough,
to form the design of casting myself on the magnanimity of the Great Frederic!  Should this
fail, I still thought my lieutenant a saviour.

Having heated my imagination with this scheme, I waited the visitation with anxiety.  The major
entered, I bespoke him thus:

"I know, sir, the great Prince Ferdinand is again in Magdeburg.  Inform him that he may examine
my prison, double the sentinels, and give me his commands, stating what hour will please him
I should make my appearance on the glacis of Klosterbergen.  If I prove myself capable of this,
I then hope for the protection of Prince Ferdinand: and that he will relate my proceeding to
the King, who may he convinced of my innocence."

The major was astonished; the proposal he held to be ridiculous, and the performance impossible.
I persisted; he returned with the sub-governor, Reichmann, the town-major, Riding, and the
major of inspection.  The answer they delivered was, that the Prince promised me his protection,
the King's favour, and a release from my chains, should I prove my assertion.  I required they
would appoint a time; they ridiculed the thing as impossible, and said that it would be sufficient
could I prove the practicability of such a scheme; but should I refuse, they would break up
the flooring, and place sentinels in my dungeon, adding, the governor would not admit of any
breaking out.

After promises of good faith, I disencumbered myself of my chains, raised my flooring, gave
them my implements, and two keys, my friends had procured me, to the doors of the subterranean
gallery.  This gallery I desired them to sound with their sword hilts, at the place through
which I was to break, which might be done in a few minutes.  I described the road I was to
take through the gallery, informed them that two of the doors had not been shut for six months,
and to the others they had the keys; adding, I had horses waiting at the glacis, that would
be now ready; the stables for which were unknown to them.  They went, examined, returned, put
questions, which I answered with precision.  They left me with seeming friendship, came back,
told me the Prince was astonished at what he had heard, that he wished me all happiness, and
then took me unfettered, to the guard-house.  The major came in the evening, treated us with
a supper, assured me everything would happen to my wishes, and that Prince Ferdinand had written
to Berlin.

The guard was reinforced next day.  The whole guard loaded with ball before my eyes, the drawbridges
were raised in open day, and precautions were taken as if I intended to make attempts as desperate
as those I had made at Glatz.

I now saw workmen employed on my dungeon, and carts bringing quarry-stones.  The officers on
guard behaved with kindness, kept a good table, at which I ate; but two sentinels, and an under-officer,
never quitted the guard-room.  Conversation was cautious, and this continued five or six days;
at length, it was the lieutenant's turn to mount guard; he appeared to be as friendly as formerly,
but conference was difficult; he found an opportunity to express his astonishment at my ill-timed
discovery, told me the Prince knew nothing of the affair, and that the report through the garrison
was, I had been surprised in making a new attempt.

My dungeon was completed in a week.  The town-major re-conducted me to it.  My foot was chained
to the wall with links twice as strong as formerly; the remainder of my irons were never after
added.

The dungeon was paved with flag-stones.  That part of my money only was saved which I had concealed
in the panels of the door, and the chimney of my stove; some thirty louis-d'ors, hidden about
my clothes, were taken from me.

While the smith was riveting my chains, I addressed the sub-governor.  "Is this the fulfilment
of the pledge of the Prince?  Think not you deceive me, I am acquainted with the false reports
that have been spread; the truth will soon come to light, and the unworthy be put to shame.
Nay, I forewarn you that Trenck shall not be much longer in your power; for were you to build
your dungeon of steel, it would be insufficient to contain me."

They smiled at me.  Reichmann told me I might soon obtain my freedom in a proper manner.  My
firm reliance on my friend, the lieutenant, gave me a degree of confidence that amazed them all.

It is necessary to explain this affair.  When I obtained my liberty, I visited Prince Ferdinand.
He informed me the majors had not made a true report.  Their story was, they had caught me
at work, and, had it not been for their diligence, I should have made my escape.  Prince Ferdinand
heard the truth, and informed the King, who only waited an opportunity to restore me to liberty.

Once more I was immured.  I waited in hope for the day when my deliverer was to mount guard.
What again was my despair when I saw another lieutenant!  I buoyed myself up with the hope
that accident was the occasion of this; but I remained three weeks, and saw him no more.  I
heard at length that he had left the corps of grenadiers, and was no longer to mount guard
at the Star Fort.  He has my forgiveness, and I applaud myself for never having said anything
by which he might be injured.  He might have repented his promise, he might have trusted another
friend with the enterprise, and have been himself betrayed; but, be it as it may, his absence
cut off all hope.

I now repented my folly and vanity; I had brought my misfortunes on myself.  I had myself rendered
my dungeon impenetrable.  Death would have followed but for the dependence I placed in the
court of Vienna.

The officers remarked the loss of my fortitude and thoughtfulness; the verses I wrote were
desponding.  The only comfort they could give was--"Patience, dear Trenck; your condition cannot
be worse; the King may not live for ever."  Were I sick, they told me I might hope my sufferings
would soon have an end.  If I recovered they pitied me, and lamented their continuance.  What
man of my rank and expectations ever endured what I did, ever was treated as I have been treated!

CHAPTER VI.

Peace had been concluded nine months.  I was forgotten.  At last, when I supposed all hope
lost, the 25th of December, and the day of freedom, came.  At the hour of parade, Count Schlieben,
lieutenant of the guards, brought orders for my release!

The sub-governor supposed me weaker in intellect than I was, and would not too suddenly tell
me these tidings.  He knew not the presence of mind, the fortitude, which the dangers I had
seen had made habitual.

My doors for the LAST TIME resounded!  Several people entered; their countenances were cheerful,
and the sub-governor at their head at length said, "This time, my dear Trenck, I am the messenger
of good news.  Prince Ferdinand has prevailed on the King to let your irons be taken off."
Accordingly, to work went the smith.  "You shall also," continued he, "have a better apartment."
"I am free, then," said I.  "Speak! fear not! I can moderate my transports."

"Then you are free!" was the reply.

The sub-governor first embraced me, and afterwards his attendants.

He asked me what clothes I would wish.  I answered, the uniform of my regiment.  The tailor
took my measure.  Reichmann told him it must be made by the morning.  The man excused himself
because it was Christmas Eve.  "So, then, this gentleman must remain in his dungeon because
it is holiday with you."  The tailor promised to be ready.

I was taken to the guard-room, congratulations were universal, and the town-major administered
the oath customary to all state prisoners.

1st.  That I should avenge myself on no man.

2nd.  That I should neither enter the Prussian nor Saxon states.

3rd.  That I should never relate by speech or in writing what had happened to me.

4th.  And that, so long as the King lived, I should neither serve in a civil nor military capacity.

Count Schlieben delivered me a letter from the imperial minister, General Reidt, to the following
purport:--That he rejoiced at having found an opportunity of obtaining my liberty from the
King, and that I must obey the requisitions of Count Schlieben, whose orders were to accompany
me to Prague.

"Yes, dear Trenck," said Schlieben, "I am to conduct you through Dresden to Prague, with orders
not to suffer you to speak to any one on the road. I have received three hundred ducats, to
defray the expenses of travelling.  As all things cannot be prepared today, the, sub-governor
has determined we shall depart to-morrow night."

I acquiesced, and Count Schlieben remained with me; the others returned to town, and I dined
with the major and officers on guard, with General Walrabe in his prison.

Once at liberty, I walked about the fortifications, to collect the money I had concealed in
my dungeon.  To every man on guard I gave a ducat, to the sentinels, each three, and ten ducats
to be divided among the relief- guard.  I sent the officer on guard a present from Prague,
and the remainder of my money I bestowed on the widow of the worthy Gelfhardt.  He was no more,
and she had entrusted the thousand florins to a young soldier, who, spending them too freely,
was suspected, betrayed her, and she passed two years in prison.  Gelfhardt never received
any punishment; he was in the field.  Had he left any children, I should have provided for
them.  To the widow of the man who hung himself before my prison door, in the year 1756, I
gave thirty ducats, lent me by Schlieben.

The night was riotous, the guard made merry, and I passed most of it in their company.  I was
visited by all the generals of the garrison on Christmas morning, for I was not allowed to
enter the town.  I dressed, viewed myself in the glass, and found pleasure; but the tumult
of my passions, the congratulations I received, and the vivacity round me, prevented my remembering
incidents minutely.

Yet how wonderful an alteration in the countenances of those by whom I had been guarded!  I
was treated with friendship, attention, and flattery.  And why?  Because these fetters had
dropped off which I had never justly borne.

Evening came, and with it Count Schlieben, a waggon, and four post-horses.  After an affecting
farewell, we departed.  I shed tears at leaving Magdeburg.  It seems strange that I lived here
ten years, yet never saw the town.

The duration of my imprisonment at Magdeburg was nearly ten years, and with the term of my
imprisonment at Glatz, the time is eleven years.  Thus was I robbed of time, my body weakened,
my health impaired, so that in my decline of life, a second time, I suffer the gloom and chains
of the dungeon at Magdeburg.

The reader would now hope that my calamities were at an end; yet, upon my honour, I would prefer
the suffering of the Star Fort to those I have since endured in Austria, especially while Krugel
and Zetto were my referendaries and curators.

At this moment I am obliged to be guarded in my expressions.  I have put my enemies to shame;
but the hope of justice or reward is vain.  No rewards are bestowed on him who, with the consciousness
of integrity, demands, and does not deplore.  The facts I shall relate will seem incredible,
yet I have, in my own hands, the vouchers of their veracity.

"If my right hand is guilty of writing untruths in this book, may the executioner sever it
from my body, and, in the memory of posterity, may I live a villain!"

I will proceed with my history.

On the 2nd of January I arrived, with Count Schlieben, at Prague; the same day he delivered
me to the governor, the Duke of Deuxponts.  He received me with kindness; we dined with him
two days, and all Prague were anxious to see a man who had surmounted ten years of suffering
so unheard of as mine.  Here I received three thousand florins, and paid General Reidt his
three hundred ducats, which he had advanced Count Schlieben, for my journey, the repayment
of which he demanded in his letter, although he had received ten thousand florins.  The expense
of returning I also paid to Schlieben, made him a present, and provided myself with some necessaries.
After remaining a few days at Prague, a courier arrived from Vienna, to whom I was obliged
to pay forty florins, with an order from government to bring me from Prague to Vienna.  My
sword was demanded; Captain Count Wela, and two inferior officers, entered the carriage, which
I was obliged to purchase, in company with me, and brought me to Vienna.  I took up a thousand
florins more, in Prague, to defray these expenses, and was obliged, in Vienna, to pay the captain
fifty ducats for travelling charges back.

I was brought back like a criminal, was sent as a prisoner to the barracks, there kept in the
chamber of Lieutenant Blonket, with orders that I should be suffered to write to no one, speak
to no one, without a ticket from the counsellors Kempt or Huttner.

Thus I remained six weeks; at length, the colonel of the regiment of Poniatowsky, the present
field-marshal, Count Alton, spoke to me.  I related what I supposed were the reasons of my
being kept a prisoner in Vienna; and to the exertions of this man am I indebted that the intentions
of my enemies were frustrated, which were to have me imprisoned as insane in the fortress of
Glatz.  Had they once removed me from Vienna, I should certainly have pined away my life in
a madhouse. Yet I could never obtain justice against these men.  The Empress was persuaded
that my brain was affected, and that I uttered threats against the King of Prussia.  The election
of a king of the Romans was then in agitation, and the court was apprehensive lest I should
offend the Prussian envoy.  General Reidt had been obliged to promise Frederic that I should
not appear in Vienna, and that they should hold a wary eye over me.  The Empress-Queen felt
compassion for my supposed disease, and asked if no assistance could be afforded me; to which
they answered, I had several times let blood, but that I still was a dangerous man.  They added,
that I had squandered four thousand florins in six days at Prague; that it would be proper
to appoint guardians to impede such extravagancies.

Count Alton spoke of me and my hard destiny to the Countess Parr, mistress of the ceremonies
to the Empress-Queen.  The late Emperor entered the chamber, and asked whether I ever had any
lucid intervals. "May it please your Majesty," answered Alton, "he has been seven weeks in
my barracks, and I never met a more reasonable man.  There is mystery in this affair, or he
could not be treated as a madman.  That he is not so in anywise I pledge my honour."

The next day the Emperor sent Count Thurn, grand-master of the Archduke Leopold, to speak to
me.  In him I found an enlightened philosopher, and a lover of his country.  To him I related
how I had twice been betrayed, twice sold at Vienna, during my imprisonment; to him showed
that my administrators had acted in this vile manner that I might be imprisoned for life, and
they remain in possession of my effects.  We conversed for two hours, during which many things
were said that prudence will not permit me to repeat.  I gained his confidence, and he continued
my friend till death.  He promised me protection, and procured me an audience of the Emperor.

I spoke with freedom; the audience lasted an hour.  At length the Emperor retired into the
next apartment.  I saw the tears drop from his eyes.  I fell at his feet, and wished for the
presence of a Rubens or Apelles, to preserve a scene so honourable to the memory of the monarch,
and paint the sensations of an innocent man, imploring the protection of a compassionate prince.
The Emperor tore himself from me, and I departed with sensations such as only those can know
who, themselves being virtuous, have met with wicked men.  I returned to the barracks with
joy, and an order the next day came for my release.  I went with Count Alton to the Countess
Parr, and by her mediation I obtained an audience with the Empress.

I cannot describe how much she pitied my sufferings and admired my fortitude.  She told me
she was informed of the artifices practised against me in Vienna; she required me to forgive
my enemies, and pass all the accounts of my administrators.  "Do not complain of anything,"
said she, "but act as I desire--I know all--you shall be recompensed by me; you deserve reward
and repose, and these you shall enjoy."

I must either sign whatever was given to sign, or be sent to a madhouse. I received orders
to accompany M. Pistrich to Counsellor Ziegler; thither I went, and the next day was obliged
to sign, in their presence, the following conditions:--

First--That I acknowledged the will of Trenck to be valid.

Secondly--That I renounced all claim to the Sclavonian estates, relying alone on her Majesty's
favour.

Thirdly--That I solemnly acquitted my accountants and curators.  And,

Lastly--That I would not continue in Vienna.

This I must sign, or languish in prison.

How did my blood boil while I signed!  This confidence I had in myself assured me I could obtain
employment in any country of Europe, by the labours of my mind, and the recital of all my woes.
At that time I had no children; I little regretted what I had lost, or the poor portion that
remained.

I determined to avoid Austria eternally.  My pride would never suffer me, by insidious arts,
to approach the throne.  I knew no such mode of soliciting for justice, hence I was not a match
for my enemies; hence my misfortunes.  Appeals to justice were represented as the splenetic
effusions of a man never to be satisfied.  My too sensitive heart was corroded by the treatment
I met at Vienna.  I, who with so much fortitude had suffered so much in the cause of Vienna,
I, on whom the eyes of Germany were fixed, to behold what should be the reward of these sufferings,
I was again, in this country, kept a prisoner, and delivered to those by whom I had been plundered
as a man insane!

Before my intended departure to seek my fortune, I fell ill, and sickness almost brought me
to the grave.  The Empress, in her great clemency, sent one of her physicians and a friar to
my assistance, both of whom I was obliged to pay.

At this time I refused a major's commission, for which I was obliged to pay the fees.  Being
excluded from actual service, to me the title was of little value; my rank in the army had
been equal ten years before in other service.  The following words, inserted in my commission,
are not unworthy of remark:--"Her Majesty, in consequence of my fidelity for her service, demonstrated
during a long imprisonment, my endowments and virtues, had been graciously pleased to grant
me, in the Imperial service, the rank of major."--The rank of major!--From this preamble who
would not have expected either the rank of general, or the restoration of my great Sclavonian
estates?  I had been fifteen years a captain of cavalry, and then was I made an invalid major
three-and-twenty years ago, and an invalid major I still remain!  Let all that has been related
be called to mind, the manner in which I had been pillaged and betrayed; let Vienna, Dantzic,
and Magdeburg he remembered; and be this my promotion remembered also!  Let it be known that
the commission of major might be bought for a few thousand florins!  Thirty thousand florins
only of the money I had been robbed of would have purchased a colonel's commission.  I should
then have been a companion for generals.

During the thirty-six years that I have been in the service of Austria, I never had any man
of rank, any great general, my enemy, except Count Grassalkowitz, and he was only my enemy
because he had conceived a friendship for my estates.

My character was never calumniated, nor did any worthy man ever speak of me but with respect.
Who were, who are, my enemies?--Jesuits, monks, unprincipled advocates, wishing to become my
curators, referendaries, who died despicable, or now live in houses of correction.  Such as
live, live in dread of a similar end, for the Emperor Joseph is able to discover the truth.
Alas! the truth is discovered so late; age has now nearly rendered me an invalid.  Men with
hearts so base ought, indeed, to become the scavengers of society, that, terrified by their
example, succeeding judges may not rack the heart of an honest man, seize on the possessions
of the orphan and the widow, and expel virtue out of Austria.

I attended the levee of Prince Kaunitz.  Not personally known to him, he viewed in me a crawling
insect.  I thought somewhat more proudly; my actions were upright, and so should my body be.
I quitted the apartment, and was congratulated by the mercenary Swiss porter on my good fortune
of having obtained an audience!

I applied to the field-marshal, from whom I received this answer--"If you cannot purchase,
my dear Trenck, it will be impossible to admit you into service; besides, you are too old to
learn our manoeuvres."  I was then thirty-seven.  I briefly replied, "Your excellency mistakes
my character. I did not come to Vienna to serve as an invalid major.  My curators have taken
good care I should have no money to purchase; but had I millions, I would never obtain rank
in the army by that mode."  I quitted the room with a shrug.  The next day I addressed a memorial
to the Empress.  I did not re-demand my Sclavonian estates, I only petitioned.

First--That those who had carried off quintals of silver and gold from the premises, and had
rendered no account to me or the treasury, should refund at least a part.

Secondly--That they should be obliged to return the thirty-six thousand florins taken from
my inheritance, and applied to a hospital.

Thirdly--That the thirty-six thousand florins might be repaid, which Count Grassalkowitz had
deducted from the allodial estates, for three thousand six hundred pandours who had fallen
in the service of the Empress; I not being bound to pay for the lives of men who had died in
defence of the Empress.

Fourthly--I required that fifteen thousand florins, which had been deducted from my capital,
and applied to the Bohemian fortifications, should likewise be restored, together with the
fifteen thousand which had been unduly paid to the regiment of Trenck.

Fifthly--I reclaimed the twelve thousand florins which I had been robbed of at Dantzic by the
treachery of the Imperial Resident, Abramson; and public satisfaction from the magistracy of
Dantzic, who had delivered me up, so contrary to the laws of nations, to the Prussian power.

I likewise claimed the interest of six per cent, for seventy-six thousand florins, detained
by the Hungarian Chamber, which amounted to twenty thousand florins; I having been allowed
five per cent., and at last four.

I insisted on the restoration of my Sclavonian estates, and a proper allowance for improvements,
which the very sentence of the court had granted, and which amounted to eighty thousand florins.

I petitioned for an arbitrator; I solicited justice concerning rights, but received no answer
to this and a hundred other petitions!

I must here speak of transactions during my imprisonment.  I had bought a house in Vienna in
the year 1750; the price was sixteen thousand florins, thirteen thousand of which I had paid
by instalments.  The receipts were among my writings; these writings, with my other effects,
were taken from me at Dantzic, in the year 1754; nor have I, to this hour, been able to learn
more than that my writings were sent to the administrators of my affairs at Vienna.  With respect
to my houses and property in Dantzic, in what manner these were disposed of no one could or
would say.

After being released at Magdeburg, I inquired concerning my house, but no longer found it mine.
Those who had got possession of my writings must have restored the acquittances to the seller,
consequently he could re- demand the whole sum.  My house was in other hands, and I was brought
in debtor six thousand florins for interest and costs of suit.  Thus were house and money gone.
Whom can I accuse?

Again, I had maintained, at my own expense Lieutenant Schroeder, who had deserted from Glatz,
and for whom I obtained a captain's commission in the guard of Prince Esterhazy, at Eisenstadt.
His misconduct caused him to be cashiered.  In my administrator's accounts I found the following

"To Captain Schroeder, for capital, interest, and costs of suit, sixteen hundred florins."

It was certain I was not a penny indebted to this person; I had no redress, having been obliged
to pass and sign all their accounts.

I, four years afterwards, obtained information concerning this affair: I met Schroeder, knew
him, and inquired whether he had received these sixteen hundred florins.  He answered in the
affirmative.  "No one believed you would ever more see the light.  I knew you would serve me,
and that you would relieve my necessities.  I went and spoke to Dr. Berger; he agreed we should
halve the sum, and his contrivance was, I should make oath I had lent you a thousand florins,
without having received your note.  The money was paid me by M. Frauenberger, to whom I agreed
to send a present of Tokay, for Madam Huttner."

This was the manner in which my curators took care of my property!  Many instances I could
produce, but I am too much agitated by the recollection.  I must speak a word concerning who
and what my curators were.

  Yet they were unable
to prevent my writings from producing me much money, or from being circulated through all Germany.
The Aix-la-Chapelle Journal became so famous, that in the second year I had four thousand subscribers,
by each of whom I gained a ducat.

The postmasters, who gained considerably by circulating newspapers, were envious, because the
Aix-la-Chapelle Journal destroyed several of the others, and they therefore formed a combination.

Prince Charles of Sweden placed confidence in me during his residence at Aix-la-Chapelle and
Spa, and I accompanied him into Holland.  When I took my leave of him at Maestricht, he said
to me, "When my father dies, either my brother shall be King, or we will lose our heads." 
The King died, and Prince Charles soon after said, in the postscript of one of his letters,
"What we spoke of at Maestricht will soon be fully accomplished, and you may then come to Stockholm."

On this, I inserted an article in my journal declaring a revolution had taken place in Sweden,
that the king had made himself absolute.  The other papers expressed their doubts, and I offered
to wager a thousand ducats on the truth of the article published in my journal under the title
of "Aix-la-Chapelle."  The news of the revolution in Sweden was confirmed.

My journal foretold the Polish partition six weeks sooner than any other; but how I obtained
this news must not be mentioned.  I was active in the defence of Queen Matilda of Denmark.

The French Ministry were offended at the following pasquinade:--"The three eagles have rent
the Polish bear, without losing a feather with which any man in the Cabinet of Versailles can
write.  Since the death of Mazarin, they write only with goose-quills."

By desire of the King of Poland, I wrote a narrative of the attempt made to assassinate him,
and named the nuncio who had given absolution to the conspirators in the chapel of the Holy Virgin.

The house was now in flames.  Rome insisted I should recall my words.  Her nuncio, at Cologne,
vented poison, daggers, and excommunication; the Empress-Queen herself thought proper to interfere.
I obtained, for my justification, from Warsaw a copy of the examination of the conspirators.
This I threatened to publish, and stood unmoved in the defence of truth.

The Empress wrote to the Postmaster-General of the Empire, and commanded him to lay an interdict
on the Aix-la-Chapelle Journal.  Informed of this, I ended its publication with the year, but
wrote an essay on the partition of Poland, which also did but increase my enemies.

The magistracy of Aix-la-Chapelle is elected from the people, and the Burghers' court consists
of an ignorant rabble.  I know no exceptions but Baron Lamberte and De Witte; and this people
assume titles of dignity, for which they are amenable to the court at Vienna.  Knowing I should
find little protection at Vienna, they imagined they might drive me from their town.  I was
a spy on their evil deeds, of whom they would have rid themselves.  I knew that the two sheriffs,
Kloss and Furth, and the recorder, Geyer, had robbed the town-chamber of forty thousand dollars,
and divided the spoil.  To these I was a dangerous man.  For such reasons they sought a quarrel
with me, pretending I had committed a trespass by breaking down a hedge, and cited me to appear
at the town-house.

The postmaster, Heinsberg, of Aix-la-Chapelle, although he had two thousand three hundred rix-dollars
of mine in his possession, instituted false suits against me, obtained verdicts against me,
seized on a cargo of wine at Cologne, and I incurred losses to the amount of eighteen thousand
florins, which devoured the fortune of my wife, and by which she, with myself and my children,
were reduced to poverty.

The Gravenitz himself, in 1778, acknowledged how much he had injured me, affirmed he had been
deceived, and promised he would try to obtain restitution.  I forgave him, and he attempted
to keep his promise; but his power declined; the bribes he had received became too public.
He was dispossessed of his post, but, alas! too late for me.  Two other of my judges are at
this time obliged to sweep the streets of Vienna, where they are condemned to the House of
Correction.  Had this been their employment instead of being seated on the seat of judgment
twenty years ago, I might have been more fortunate.  It is a remarkable circumstance that I
should so continually have been despoiled by unjust judges.  Who would have had the temerity
to affirm that their evil deeds should bring them to attend on the city scavenger?  I indeed
knew them but too well, and fearlessly spoke what I knew.  It was my misfortune that I was
acquainted with their malpractices sooner than gracious Sovereign.

Let the scene close on my litigations at Aix-la-Chapelle and Vienna.  May God preserve every
honest man from the like!  They have swallowed up my property, and that of my wife.  Enough!

CHAPTER VIII.

From the year 1774 to 1777, I journeyed through England and France.  I was intimate with Dr.
Franklin, the American Minister, and with the Counts St. Germain and de Vergennes, who made
me proposals to go to America; but I was prevented by my affection for my wife and children.

My friend the Landgrave of Hesse-Cassel, who had been Governor of Magdeburg during my imprisonment,
offered me a commission among the troops going to America, but I answered--"Gracious prince,
my heart beats in the cause of freedom only; I will never assist in enslaving men.  Were I
at the head of your brave grenadiers.  I should revolt to the Americans."

During 1775 I continued at Aix-la-Chapelle my essays, entitled, "The Friend of Men."  My writings
had made some impression; the people began to read; the monks were ridiculed, but my partisans
increased, and their leader got himself cudgelled.

They did not now mention my name publicly, but catechised their penitents at confession.  During
this year people came to me from Cologne, Bonn, and Dusseldorf, to speak with me privately.
When I inquired their business, they told me their clergy had informed them I was propagating
a new religion, in which every man must sign himself to the devil, who then would supply them
with money.  They were willing to become converts to my faith, would Beelzebub but give them
money, and revenge them on their priests.  "My good friends," answered I, "your teachers have
deceived you; I know of no devils but themselves.  Were it true that I was founding a new religion,
the converts to whom the devil would supply money, your priests, would be the first of my apostles,
and the most catholic.  I am an honest, moral man, as a Christian ought to be.  Go home, in
God's name, and do your duty."

I forgot to mention that the recorder of the sheriff's court at Aix-la- Chapelle, who is called
Baron Geyer, had associated himself in 1778 with a Jew convert, and that this noble company
swindled a Dutch merchant out of eighty thousand florins, by assuming the arms of Elector Palatine,
and producing forged receipts and contracts.  Geyer was taken in Amsterdam, and would have
been hanged, but, by the aid of a servant, he escaped.  He returned to Aix-la-Chapelle, where
he enjoys his office.  Three years ago he robbed the town-chamber.  His wife was, at that time,
generis communis, and procured him friends at court.  The assertions of this gentleman found
greater credit at Vienna than those of the injured Trenck!  Oh, shame!  Oh, world! world!

My wine trade was so successful that I had correspondents and stores in London, Paris, Brussels,
Hamburg, and the Hague, and had gained forty thousand florins.  One unfortunate day destroyed
all my hopes in the success of this traffic.

In London I was defrauded of eighteen hundred guineas by a swindler.  The fault was my brother-in-law's,
who parted with the wine before he had received the money.  When I had been wronged, and asked
my friends' assistance, I was only laughed at, as if they were happy that an Englishman had
the wit to cheat a German.

Finding myself defrauded, I hastened to Sir John Fielding.  He told me he knew I had been swindled,
and that his friendship would make him active in my behalf; that he also knew the houses where
my wine was deposited, and that a party of his runners should go with me, sufficiently strong
for its recovery.  I was little aware that he had, at that time, two hundred bottles of my
best Tokay in his cellar.  His pretended kindness was a snare; he was in partnership with robbers,
only the stupid among whom he hanged, and preserved the most adroit for the promotion of trade.

He sent a constable and six of his runners with me, commanding them to act under my orders.
By good fortune I had a violent headache, and sent my brother-in-law, who spoke better English
than I.  Him they brought to the house of a Jew, and told him, "Your wine, sir, is here concealed."
Though it was broad day, the door was locked, that he might be induced to act illegally.  The
constable desired him to break the door open, which he did; the Jews came running, and asked--"What
do you want, gentlemen?"--"I want my wine," answered my brother.--"Take what is your own,"
replied a Jew; "but beware of touching my property.  I have bought the wine."

My brother attended the constable and runners into a cellar, and found a great part of my wine.
He wrote to Sir John Fielding that he had found the wine, and desired to know how to act. 
Fielding answered: "It must be taken by the owner."  My brother accordingly sent me the wine.

Next day came a constable with a warrant, saying, "He wanted to speak with my brother, and
that he was to go to Sir John Fielding."  When he was in the street, he told him--"Sir, you
are my prisoner."

I went to Sir John Fielding, and asked him what it meant.  This justice answered that my brother
had been accused of felony.  The Jews and swindlers had sworn the wine was a legal purchase.
If I had not been paid, or was ignorant of the English laws, that was my fault.  Six swindlers
had sworn the wine was paid for, which circumstance he had not known, or he should not have
granted me a warrant.  My brother had also broken open the doors, and forcibly taken away wine
which was not his own.  They made oath of this, and he was charged with burglary and robbery.

He desired me to give bail in a thousand guineas for my brother for his appearance in the Court
of King's Bench; otherwise his trial would immediately come on, and in a few days he would
be hanged.

I hastened to a lawyer, who confirmed what had been told me, advised me to give bail, and he
would then defend my cause.  I applied to Lord Mansfield, and received the same answer.  I
told my story to all my friends, who laughed at me for attempting to trade in London without
understanding the laws.  My friend Lord Grosvenor said, "Send more wine to London, and we will
pay you so well that you will soon recover your loss."

I went to my wine-merchants, who had a stock of mine worth upwards of a thousand guineas. 
They gave bail for my brother, and he was released.

Fielding, in the interim, sent his runners to my house, took back the wine, and restored it
to the Jews.  They threatened to prosecute me as a receiver of stolen goods.  I fled from London
to Paris, where I sold off my stock at half-price, honoured my bills, and so ended my merchandise.

My brother returned to London in November, to defend his cause in the Court of King's Bench;
but the swindlers had disappeared, and the lawyer required a hundred pounds to proceed.  The
conclusion was that my brother returned with seventy pounds less in his pocket, spent as travelling
expenses, and the stock in the hands of my wine-merchants was detained on pretence of paying
the bail.  They brought me an apothecary's bill, and all was lost.

The Swedish General Sprengporten came to Aix-la-Chapelle in 1776.  He had planned and carried
into execution the revolution so favourable to the King, but had left Sweden in discontent,
and came to take the waters with a rooted hypochondria.

He was the most dangerous man in Sweden, and had told the King himself, after the revolution,
in the presence of his guards, "While Sprengporten can hold a sword, the King has nothing to
command."

It was feared he would go to Russia, and Prince Charles wrote to me in the name of the monarch,
desiring I would exert myself to persuade him to return to Sweden.  He was a man of pride,
which rendered him either a fool or a madman.  He despised everything that was not Swedish.

The Prussian Minister, Count Hertzberg, the same year came to Aix-la-Chapelle.  I enjoyed his
society for three months, and accompanied this great man.  To his liberality am I indebted
that I can return to my country with honour.

The time I had to spare was not spent in idleness; I attacked, in my weekly writings, those
sharpers who attend at Aix-la-Chapelle and Spa to plunder both inhabitants and visitants, under
the connivance of the magistracy; nor are there wanting foreign noblemen who become the associates
of these pests of society.  The publication of such truths endangered my life from the desperadoes,
who, when detected, had nothing more to lose.  How powerful is an innocent life, nothing can
more fully prove than that I still exist, in despite of all the attempts of wicked monks and
despicable sharpers.

Though my life was much disturbed, yet I do not repent of my manner of acting; many a youth,
many a brave man, have I detained from the gaming- table, and pointed out to them the most
notorious sharpers.

This was so injurious to Spa, that the Bishop of Liege himself, who enjoys a tax on all their
winnings, and therefore protects such villains, offered me an annual pension of five hundred
guineas if I would not come to Spa; or three per cent. on the winnings, would I but associate
myself with Colonel N---t, and raise recruits for the gaming-table.  My answer may easily be
imagined; yet for this was I threatened to be excommunicated by the Holy Catholic Church!

I and my family passed sixteen summers in Spa.  My house became the rendezvous of the most
respectable part of the company, and I was known to some of the most respectable characters
in Europe.

A contest arose between the town of Aix-la-Chapelle and Baron Blankart, the master of the hounds
to the Elector Palatine: it originated in a dispute concerning precedence between the before-mentioned
wife of the Recorder Geyer and the sister of the Burgomaster of Aix-la-Chapelle, Kahr, who
governed that town with despotism.

This quarrel was detrimental to the town and to the Elector Palatine, but profitable to Kahr,
whose office it was to protect the rights of the town, and those persons who defended the claims
of the Elector; the latter kept a faro bank, the plunder of which had enriched the town; and
the former Kahr, under pretence of defending their cause, embezzled the money of the people;
so that both parties endeavoured with all their power to prolong the litigation.

It vexed me to see their proceedings.  Those who suffered on each side were deceived; and I
conceived the project of exposing the truth.  For this purpose I journeyed to the court at
Mannheim, related the facts to the Elector, produced a plan of accommodation, which he approved,
and obtained power to act as arbitrator.  The Minister of the Elector, Bekkers, pretended to
approve my zeal, conducted me to an auberge, made me dine at his house, and said a commission
was made out for my son, and forwarded to Aix-la-Chapelle--which was false; the moment he quitted
me he sent to Aix-la-Chapelle to frustrate the attempt he pretended to applaud.  He was himself
in league with the parties.  In fine, this silly interference brought me only trouble, expense,
and chagrin.  I made five journeys to Mannheim, till I became so dissatisfied that I determined
to quit Aix-la-Chapelle, and purchase an estate in Austria.

The Bavarian contest was at this time in agitation; my own affairs brought me to Paris, and
here I learned intelligence of great consequence; this I communicated to the Grand Duke of
Florence, on my return to Vienna.  The Duke departed to join the army in Bohemia, and I again
wrote to him, and thought it my duty to send a courier.  The Duke showed my letter to the Emperor;
but I remained unnoticed.

I did not think myself safe in foreign countries during this time of war, and purchased the
lordship of Zwerbach, with appurtenances, which, with the expenses, cost me sixty thousand florins.

To conclude this purchase, I was obliged to solicit the referendary, Zetto, and his friend
whom he had appointed as my curator, for my new estate was likewise made a fidei commissum,
as my referendaries and curators would not let me escape contribution.  The six thousand florins
of which they emptied my purse would have done my family much service.

In May, 1780, I went to Aix-la-Chapelle, where my wife's mother died in July; and in September
my wife, myself, and family, all came to Vienna.

My wife solicited the mistress of the ceremonies to obtain an audience. Her request was granted,
and she gained the favour of the Empress.  Her kindness was beyond expression: she introduced
my wife to the Archduchess, and commanded her mistress of the ceremonies to present her everywhere.
"You were unwilling," said she, "to accompany your husband into my country, but I hope to convince
you that you may live happier in Austria than at Aix-la-Chapelle."

She next day sent me her decree, assuring me of a pension of four hundred florins.

My wife petitioned the Empress to grant me an audience: her request was complied with: and
the Empress said to me: "This is the third time in which I would have made your fortune, had
you been so disposed."  She desired to see my children, and spoke of my writings.  "How much
good might you do," said she, "would you but write in the cause of religion!"

We departed for Zwerbach, where we lived contentedly, but when we were preparing to return
to Vienna, and solicited the restitution of part of my lost fortune, during this favour of
the court, Theresa died, and all my hopes were overcast.

I forgot to relate that the Archduchess, Maria Anna, desired me to translate a religious work,
written in French by the Abbe Baudrand, into German.  I replied I would obey Her Majesty's
commands.  I began my work, took passages from Baudrand, but inserted more of my own.  The
first volume was finished in six weeks; the Empress thought it admirable.  The second soon
followed, and I presented this myself.

She asked me if it equalled the first; I answered, I hoped it would be found more excellent.
"No," said she; "I never in my life read a better book:" and added, "she wondered how I could
write so well and so quickly."  I promised another volume within a month.  Before the third
was ready, Theresa died.  She gave orders on her death-bed to have the writings of Baron Trenck
read to her; and though her confessor well knew the injustice that had been done me, yet in
her last moments he kept silence, though he had given me his sacred promise to speak in my behalf.

After her death the censor commanded that I should print what I have stated in the preface
to that third volume, and this was my only satisfaction.

For one-and-thirty years had I been soliciting my rights, which I never could obtain, because
the Empress was deceived by wicked men, and believed me a heretic.  In the thirty-second, my
wife had the good fortune to convince her this was false; she had determined to make me restitution;
just at this moment she died.

The pension granted my wife by the Empress in consequence of my misfortunes and our numerous
family, we only enjoyed nine months.

Of this she was deprived by the new monarch.  He perhaps knew nothing of the affair, as I never
solicited.  Yet much has it grieved me.  Perhaps I may find relief when the sighs wrung from
me shall reach the heart of the father of his people in this my last writing.  At present,
nothing for me remains but to live unknown in Zwerbach.

The Emperor thought proper to collect the moneys bestowed on hospitals into one fund.  The
system was a wise one.  My cousin Trenck had bequeathed thirty-six thousand florins to a hospital
for the poor of Bavaria.  This act he had no right to do, having deducted the sum from the
family estate.  I petitioned the Emperor that these thirty-six thousand florins might be restored
to me and my children, who were the people whom Trenck had indeed made poor, nothing of the
property of his acquiring having been left to pay this legacy, but, on the contrary, the money
having been exacted from mine.

In a few days it was determined I should be answered in the same tone in which, for six-and-thirty
years past, all my petitions had been answered:--

"THE REQUEST OF THE PETITIONER CANNOT BE GRANTED."

Fortune persecuted me in my retreat.  Within six years two hailstorms swept away my crops;
one year was a misgrowth; there were seven floods; a rot among my sheep: all possible calamities
befell me and my manor.

The estate had been ruined, the ponds were to drain, three farms were to be put into proper
condition, and the whole newly stocked.  This rendered me poor, especially as my wife's fortune
had been sunk in lawsuits at Aix- la-Chapelle and Cologne.

The miserable peasants had nothing, therefore could not pay: I was obliged to advance them
money.  My sons assisted me, and we laboured with our own hands: my wife took care of eight
children, without so much as the help of a maid.  We lived in poverty, obliged to earn our
daily bread.

The greatest of my misfortunes was my treatment in the military court, when Zetto and Krugel
were my referendaries.  Zetto had clogged me with a curator and when the cow had no more milk
to give, they began to torture me with deputations, sequestrations, administrations, and executions.
Nineteen times was I obliged to attend in Vienna within two years, at my own expense.  Every
six years must I pay an attorney to dispute and quarrel with the curator.  I, in conclusion,
was obliged to pay.  If any affair was to be expedited, I, by a third hand, was obliged to
send the referendary some ducats.  Did he give judgment, still that judgment lay fourteen months
inefficient, and, when it then appeared, the copy was false, and so was sent to the upper courts,
the high referendary of which said I "must be dislodged from Zwerbach."

They obliged me at last to purchase my naturalisation.  I sent to Prussia for my pedigree;
the attestation of this was sent me by Count Hertzberg. Although the family of Trenck had a
hundred years been landholders in Hungary, yet was my attorney obliged to solicit the instrument
called ritter-diploma, for which, under pain of execution, I must pay two thousand florins.

By decree a Prussian nobleman is not noble in Austria, where every lackey can purchase a diploma,
making him a knight of the Empire, for twelve hundred wretched florins!--where such men as
P--- and Grassalkowitz have purchased the dignity of a prince!

Tortured by the courts, terrified by hailstorms, I determined to publish my works, in eight
volumes, and this history of my life.

Fourteen months accomplished this purpose.  My labours found a favourable reception through
all Germany, procured me money, esteem, and honour.  By my writings only will I seek the means
of existence, and by trying to obtain the approbation and the love of men.

CHAPTER IX.

On the 22nd of August, 1786, the news arrived that Frederic the Great had left this world!

* * * * *

The present monarch, the witness of my sufferings in my native country, sent me a royal passport
to Berlin.  The confiscation of my estates was annulled, and my deceased brother, in Prussia,
had left my children his heirs.

* * * * *

I journey, within the Imperial permission, back to my country, from which I have been two-and-forty
years expelled!  I journey--not as a pardoned malefactor, but as a man whose innocence has
been established by his actions, has been proved in his writings, and who is journeying to
receive his reward.

Here I shall once more encounter my old friends my relations, and those who have known me in
the days of my affliction.  Here shall I appear, not as my country's Traitor, but as my country's
Martyr!

Possible, though little probable, are still future storms.  For these also I am prepared. 
Long had I reason daily to curse the rising sun, and, setting, to behold it with horror.  Death
to me appears a great benefit: a certain passage from agitation to peace, from motion to rest.
As for my children, they, jocund in youth, delight in present existence. When I have fulfilled
the duties of a father, to live or die will then be as I shall please.

Thou, O God! my righteous Judge, didst ordain that I should be an example of suffering to the
world; Thou madest me what I am, gavest me these strong passions, these quick nerves, this
thrilling of the blood, when I behold injustice.  Strong was my mind, that deeply it might
meditate on deep subjects; strong my memory, that these meditations I might retain; strong
my body, that proudly it might support all it has pleased Thee to inflict.

Should I continue to exist, should identity go with me, and should I know what I was then,
when I was called Trenck; when that combination of particles which Nature commanded should
compose this body shall be decomposed, scattered, or in other bodies united; when I have no
muscles to act, no brain to think, no retina on which pictures can mechanically be painted,
my eyes wasted, and no tongue remaining to pronounce the Creator's name, should I still behold
a Creator--then, oh then, will my spirit mount, and indubitably associate with spirits of the
just who expectant wait for their golden harps and glorious crowns from the Most High God.
For human weaknesses, human failings, arising from our nature, springing from our temperament,
which the Creator has ordained, shall be even thus, and not otherwise; for these have I suffered
enough on earth.

Such is my confession of faith; in this have I lived, in this will I die. The duties of a man
and of a Christian I have fulfilled; nay, often have exceeded, often have been too benevolent,
too generous; perhaps also too proud, too vain.  I could not bend, although liable to be broken.

That I have not served the world, in acts and employments where best I might, is perhaps my
own fault: the fault of my manner, which is now too radical to be corrected in this, my sixtieth
year.  Yes, I acknowledge my failing, acknowledge it unblushingly; nay, glory in the pride
of a noble nature.

For myself, I ask nothing of those who have read my history; to them do I commit my wife and
children.  My eldest son is a lieutenant in the Tuscan regiment of cavalry, under General Lasey,
and does honour to his father's principles.  The second serves his present Prussian Majesty,
as ensign in the Posadowsky dragoons, with equal promise.  The third is still a child. My daughters
will make worthy men happy, for they have imbibed virtue and gentleness with their mother's
milk.  Monarchs may hereafter remember what I have suffered, what I have lost, and what is
due to my ashes.

Here do I declare--I will seek no other revenge against my enemies than that of despising their
evil deeds.  It is my wish, and shall be my endeavour, to forget the past; and having committed
no offence, neither will I solicit monarchs for posts of honour; as I have ever lived a free
man, a free man will I die.

I conclude this part of my history on the evening preceding my journey to Berlin.  God grant
I may encounter no new afflictions, to be inserted in the remainder of this history.

This journey I prepared to undertake, but my ever-envious fate threw me on the bed of sickness,
insomuch that small hope remained that I ever should again behold the country of my forefathers.
I seemed following the Great Frederic to the mansions of the dead; then should I never have
concluded the history of my life, or obtained the victory by which I am now crowned.

A variety of obstacles being overcome, I found it necessary to make a journey into Hungary,
which was one of the most pleasant of my whole life.

I have no words to express my ardent wishes for the welfare of a nation where I met with so
many proofs of friendship.  Wherever I appeared I was welcomed with that love and enthusiasm
which only await the fathers of their country.  The valour of my cousin Trenck, who died ingloriously
in the Spielberg, the loss of my great Hungarian estates, the fame of my writings, and the
cruelty of my sufferings, had gone before me.  The officers of the army, the nobles of the
land, alike testified the warmth of their esteem.

Such is the reward of the upright; such too are the proofs that this nation knows the just
value of fortitude and virtue.  Have I not reason to publish my gratitude, and to recommend
my children to those who, when I am no more, shall dare uprightly to determine concerning the
rights which have unjustly been snatched from me in Hungary?

Not a man in Hungary but will proclaim I have been unjustly dealt by; yet I have good reason
to suspect I never shall find redress.  Sentence had been already given; judges, more honest,
cannot, without difficulty, reverse old decrees; and the present possessors of my estates are
too powerful, too intimate with the governors of the earth, for me to hope I shall hereafter
be more happy.  God knows my heart; I wish the present possessors may render services to the
state equal to those rendered by the family of the Trencks.

There is little probability I shall ever behold my noble friends in Hungary more.  Here I bid
them adieu, promising them to pass the remainder of any life so as still to merit the approbation
of a people with whose ashes I would most willingly have mingled my own.  May the God of heaven
preserve every Hungarian from a fate similar to mine!

The Croats have ever been reckoned uncultivated; yet, among this uncultivated people I found
more subscribers to my writings than among all the learned men of Vienna; and in Hungary, more
than in all the Austrian dominions.

The Hungarians, the unlettered Croats, seek information.  The people of Vienna ask their confessors'
permission to read instructive books. Various subscribers, having read the first volume of
my work, brought it back, and re-demanded their money, because some monk had told them it was
a book dangerous to be read.  The judges of their courts have re-sold them to the booksellers
for a few pence or given them to those who had the care of their consciences to burn.

In Vienna alone was my life described as a romance; in Hungary I found the compassion of men,
their friendship, and effectual aid.  Had my book been the production of an Englishman, good
wishes would not have been his only reward.

We German writers have interested critics to encounter if we would unmask injustice; and if
a book finds a rapid sale, dishonest printers issue spurious editions, defrauding the author
of his labours.

The encouragement of the learned produces able teachers, and from their seminaries men of genius
occasionally come forth.  The world is inundated with books and pamphlets; the undiscerning
reader knows not which to select; the more intelligent are disgusted, or do not read at all,
and thus a work of merit becomes as little profitable to the author as to the state.

I left Vienna on the 5th of January, and came to Prague.  Here I found nearly the same reception
as in Hungary; my writings were read.  Citizens, noblemen, and ladies treated me with like
favour.  May the monarch know how to value men of generous feelings and enlarged understandings!

I bade adieu to Prague, and continued my journey to Berlin.  In Bohemia, I took leave of my
son, who saw his father and his two brothers, destined for the Prussian service, depart.  He
felt the weight of this separation; I reminded him of his duty to the state he served; I spoke
of the fearful fate of his uncle and father in Austria, and of the possessors of our vast estates
in Hungary.  He shrank back--a look from his father pierced him to the soul--tears stood in
his eyes--his youthful blood flowed quick, and the following expression burst suddenly from
his lips:--"I call God to witness that I will prove myself worthy of my father's name; and
that, while I live, his enemies shall be mine!"

At Peterswald, on the road to Dresden, my carriage broke down: my life was endangered; and
my son received a contusion in the arm.  The erysipelas broke out on him at Berlin, and I could
not present him to the King for a month after.

I had been but a short time at Berlin before the well-known minister, Count Hertzberg, received
me with kindness.  Every man to whom his private worth is known will congratulate the state
that has the wisdom to bestow on him so high an office.  His scholastic and practical learning,
his knowledge of languages, his acquaintance with sciences, are indeed wonderful.  His zeal
for his country is ardent, his love of his king unprejudiced, his industry admirable, his firmness
that of a man.  He is the most experienced man in the Prussian states.  The enemies of his
country may rely on his word.  The artful he can encounter with art; those who menace, with
fortitude; and with wise foresight can avert the rising storm.  He seeks not splendour in sumptuous
and ostentatious retinue; but if he can only enrich the state, and behold the poor happy, he
is himself willing to remain poor.  His estate, Briess, near Berlin, is no Chanteloup, but
a model to those patriots who would study economy. Here he, every Wednesday, enjoys recreation.
The services he renders the kingdom cost it only five thousand rix-dollars yearly; he, therefore,
lives without ostentation, yet becoming his state, and with splendour when splendour is necessary.
He does not plunder the public treasury that he may preserve his own private property.

This man will live in the annals of Prussia: who was employed under the Great Frederic; had
so much influence in the cabinets of Europe; and was a witness of the last actions, the last
sensations, of his dying king; yet who never asked, nor ever received, the least gratuity.
This is the minister whose conversation I had the happiness to partake at Aix-la-Chapelle and
Spa, whose welfare is the wish of my heart, and whose memory I shall ever revere.

I was received with distinction at his table, and became acquainted with those whose science
had benefited the Prussian states; nor was anything more flattering to my self-love than that
men like these should think me worthy their friendship.

Not many days after I was presented to the court by the Prussian chamberlain, Prince Sacken,
as it is not customary at Berlin for a foreign subject to be presented by the minister of his
own court.  Though a Prussian subject, I wore the Imperial uniform.

The King received me with condescension; all eyes were directed towards me, each welcomed me
to my country.  This moved me the more as it was remarked by the foreign ministers, who asked
who that Austrian officer could be who was received with so much affection and such evident
joy in Berlin.  The gracious monarch himself gave tokens of pleasure at beholding me thus surrounded.
Among the rest came the worthy General Prittwitz, who said aloud--

"This is the gentleman who might have ruined me to effect his own deliverance."

Confused at so public a declaration, I desired him to expound this riddle; and he added--

"I was obliged to be one of your guards on your unfortunate journey from Dantzic to Magdeburg,
in 1754, when I was a lieutenant.  On the road I continued alone with you in an open carriage.
This gave you an opportunity to escape, but you forbore.  I afterwards saw the danger to which
I had exposed myself.  Had you been less noble-minded, had such a prisoner escaped through
my negligence, I had certainly been ruined.  The King believed you alike dangerous and deserving
of punishment.  I here acknowledge you as my saviour, and am in gratitude your friend."  I
knew not that the generous man, who wished me so well, was the present General Prittwitz. 
That he should himself remind me of this incident does him the greater honour.

Having been introduced at court, I thought it necessary to observe ceremonies, and was presented
by the Imperial ambassador, Prince Reuss, to all foreign ministers, and such families as are
in the habit of admitting such visits.  I was received by the Prince Royal, the reigning Queen,
the Queen-Dowager, and the royal family in their various places, with favour never to be forgotten.
His Royal Highness Prince Henry invited me to a private audience, continued long in conversation
with me, promised me his future protection, admitted me to his private concerts, and sometimes
made me sup at court.

A like reception I experienced in the palace of Prince Ferdinand of Brunswick, where I frequently
dined and supped.  His princess took delight in hearing my narratives, and loaded me with favour.

Prince Ferdinand's mode of educating children is exemplary.  The sons are instructed in the
soldier's duties, their bodies are inured to the inclemencies of weather; they are taught to
ride, to swim, and are steeled to all the fatigue of war.  Their hearts are formed for friendship,
which they cannot fail to attain.  Happy the nation in defence of which they are to act!

How ridiculous these their Royal Highnesses appear who, though born to rule, are not deserving
to be the lackeys to the least of those whom they treat with contempt; and yet who swell, strut,
stride, and contemplate themselves as creatures essentially different by nature, and of a superior
rank in the scale of beings, though, in reality, their minds are of the lowest, the meanest class.

Happy the state whose prince is impressed with a sense that the people are not his property,
but he the property of the people!  A prince beloved by his people will ever render a nation
more happy those he whose only wish is to inspire fear.

The pleasure I received at Berlin was great indeed.  When I went to court, the citizens crowded
to see me, and when anyone among them said, "That is Trenck," the rest would cry, "Welcome
once more to your country," while many would reach me their hands, with the tears standing
in their eyes.  Frequent were the scenes I experienced of this kind.  No malefactor would have
been so received.  It was the reward of innocence; this reward was bestowed throughout the
Prussian territories.

Oh world, ill-judging world, deceived by show!  Dost thou not blindly follow the opinion of
the prince, be he severe, arbitrary, or just?  Thy censure and thy praise equally originate
in common report.  In Magdeburg I lay, chained to the wall, ten years, sighing in wretchedness,
every calamity of hunger, cold, nakedness, and contempt.  And wherefore? Because the King,
deceived by slanderers, pronounced me worthy of punishment.  Because a wise King mistook me,
and treated me with barbarity.  Because a prudent King knew he had done wrong, yet would not
have it so supposed.  So was his heart turned to stone; nay, opposed by manly fortitude, was
enraged to cruelty.  Most men were convinced I was an innocent sufferer; "Yet did they all
cry out the more, saying, let him be crucified!"  My relations were ashamed to hear my name.
My sister was barbarously treated because she assisted me in my misfortunes.  No man durst
avow himself my friend, durst own I merited compassion; or, much less, that the infallible
King had erred.  I was the most despised, forlorn man on earth; and when thus put on the rack,
had I there expired, my epitaph would have been, "Here lies the traitor, Trenck."

Frederic is dead, and the scene is changed; another monarch has ascended the throne, and the
grub has changed to a beautiful butterfly!  The witnesses to all I have asserted are still
living, loudly now proclaim the truth, and embrace me with heart-felt affection.

Does the worth of a man depend upon his actions? his reward or punishment upon his virtue?
In arbitrary states, certainly not.  They depend on the breath of a king!  Frederic was the
most penetrating prince of his age, but the most obstinate also.  A vice dreadful to those
whom he selected as victims, who must be sacrificed to the promoting of his arbitrary views.

How many perished, the sin offerings of Frederic's obstinate self-will, whose orphan children
now cry to God for vengeance!  The dead, alas! cannot plead.  Trial began and ended with execution.
The few words--IT IS THE KING'S COMMAND--were words of horror to the poor condemned wretch
denied to plead his innocence!  Yet what is the Ukase (Imperial order) in Russia, Tel est notre
bon plaisir (Such is our pleasure) in France, or the Allergnadigste Hofresolution (The all-gracious
sentence of the court), pronounced with the sweet tone of a Vienna matron?  In what do these
differ from the arbitrary order of a military despot?

Every prayer of man should be consecrated to man's general good; for him to obtain freedom
and universal justice!  Together should we cry with one voice, and, if unable to shackle arbitrary
power, still should we endeavour to show how dangerous it is!  The priests of liberty should
offer up their thanks to the monarch who declares "the word of power" a nullity, and "the sentence"
of justice omnipotent.

Who can name the court in Europe where Louis, Peter, or Frederic, each and all surnamed The
Great, have not been, and are not, imitated as models of perfection?  Lettres-de-cachet, the
knout, and cabinet-orders, superseding all right, are become law!

No reasoning, says the corporal to the poor grenadier, whom he canes!--No reasoning! exclaim
judges; the court has decided.--No reasoning, rash and pertinacious Trenck, will the prudent
reader echo.  Throw thy pen in the fire, and expose not thyself to become the martyr of a state
inquisition.

My fate is, and must remain, critical and undecided.  I have six-and-thirty years been in the
service of Austria, unrewarded, and beholding the repeated and generous efforts I made effectually
to serve that state, unnoticed.  The Emperor Joseph supposes me old, that the fruit is wasted,
and that the husk only remains.  It is also supposed I should not be satisfied with a little.
To continue to oppress him who has once been oppressed, and who possess qualities that may
make injustice manifest, is the policy of states.  My journey to Berlin has given the slanderer
further opportunity of painting me as a suspicious character: I smile at the ineffectual attempt.

I appeared in the Imperial uniform and belied such insinuations.  To this purpose it was written
to court, in November, when I went into Hungary, "The motions of Trenck ought to be observed
in Hungary."  Ye poor malicious blood-suckers of the virtuous!  Ye shall not be able to hurt
a hair of my head.  Ye cannot injure the man who has sixty years lived in honour.  I will not,
in my old age, bring upon myself the reproach of inconstancy, treachery, or desire of revenge.
I will betray no political secrets: I wish not to injure those by whom I have been injured.--Such
acts I will never commit.  I never yet descended to the office of spy, nor will I die a rewarded
villain.

Yes, I appeared in Berlin among the upright and the just.  Instead of being its supposed enemy,
I was declared an honour to my country.  I appeared in the Imperial uniform and fulfilled the
duties of my station: and now must the Prussian Trenck return to Austria, there to perform
a father's duty.

Yet more of what happened in Berlin.

Some days after I had been presented to the King, I entreated a private audience, and on the
12th of February received the following letter:--

   "In answer to your letter of the 8th of this month, I inform you that,
   if you will come to me to-morrow, at five o'clock in the afternoon, I
   shall have the pleasure to speak with you; meantime, I pray God to
   take you into his holy keeping.

   "FREDERIC WILLIAM.

   "Berlin, Feb. 12, 1787."

   "P.S.--After signing the above, I find it more convenient to appoint
   to-morrow, at nine in the morning, about which time you will come into
   the apartment named the Marmor Kammer (marble chamber)."

The anxiety with which I expected this wished-for interview may well be conceived.  I found
the Prussian Titus alone, and he continued in conversation with me more than an hour.

How kind was the monarch!  How great!  How nobly did he console me for the past!  How entirely
did his assurance of favour overpower my whole soul!  He had read the history of my life. 
When prince of Prussia, he had been an eyewitness, in Magdeburg, of my martyrdom, and my attempts
to escape.  His Majesty parted from me with tokens of esteem and condescension.--My eyes bade
adieu, but my heart remained in the marble chamber, in company with a prince capable of sensations
so dignified; and my wishes for his welfare are eternal.

I have since travelled through the greater part of the Prussian states. Where is the country
in which the people are all satisfied?  Many complained of hard times, or industry unrewarded.
My answer was:--

"Friends, kneel with the rising sun, and thank the God of heaven that you are Prussians.  I
have seen and known much of this world, and I assure you, you are among the happiest people
of Europe.  Causes of complaint everywhere exist; but you have a king, neither obstinate, ambitious,
covetous, nor cruel: his will is that his people should have cause of content, and should he
err by chance, his heart is not to blame if the subject suffers."

Prussia is neither wanting in able nor learned men.  The warmth of patriots glows in their
veins.  Everything remains with equal stability, as under the reign of Frederic; and should
the thunder burst, the ready conductors will render the shock ineffectual.

Hertzberg still labours in the cabinet, still thinks, writes, and acts as he has done for years.
The king is desirous that justice shall be done to his subjects, and will punish, perhaps,
with more severity, whenever he finds himself deceived, than from the goodness of his disposition,
might be supposed.  The treasury is full, the army continues the same, and there is little
reason to doubt but that industry, population, and wealth will increase.  None but the vile
and the wicked would leave the kingdom; while the oppressed and best subjects of other states
would fly from their native country, certain of finding encouragement and security in Prussia.

The personal qualities of Fredric William merit description.  He is tall and handsome, his
mien is majestic, and his accomplishments of mind and body would procure him the love of men,
were he not a king.  He is affable without deceit, friendly and kind in conversation, and stately
when stateliness is necessary.  He is bountiful, but not profuse; he knows that without economy
the Prussian must sink.  He is not tormented by the spirit of conquest, he wishes harm to no
nation, yet he will certainly not suffer other nations to make encroachments, nor will he be
terrified by menaces.

The wise Frederic, when living, though himself learned, and a lover of the sciences, never
encouraged them in his kingdom.  Germany, under his reign, might have forgotten her language:
he preferred the literature of France.  Konigsberg, once the seminary of the North, contains,
at present, few professors, or students; the former are fallen into disrepute, and are ill
paid; the latter repair to Leipsic and Gottingen. We have every reason to suppose the present
monarch, though no studious man himself, will encourage the academies of the literati, that
men learned in jurisprudence and the sciences may not be wanting: which want is the more to
be apprehended as the nobility must, without exception, serve in the army, so that learning
has but few adherents, and these are deprived of the means of improvement.

Frederic William is also too much the friend of men to suffer them to pine in prisons.  He
abhors the barbarity with which the soldiers are beaten: his officers will not be fettered
hand and foot; slavish subordination will be banished, and the noble in heart will be the noble
of the land.  May he, in his people, find perfect content!  May his people be ever worthy of
such a prince!  Long may he reign, and may his ministers be ever enlightened and honourable men!

He sent for me a second time, conversed much with me, and confirmed those ideas which my first
interview had inspired.

On the 11th of March I presented my son at another audience, whom I intended for the Prussian
service.  The King bestowed a commission on him in the Posadowsky dragoons, at my request.

I saw him at the review at Velau, and his superior officers formed great expectations from
his zeal.  Time will discover whether he who is in the Austrian, or this in the Prussian service,
will first obtain the rewards due to their father.  Should they both remain unnoticed, I will
bestow him on the Grand Turk, rather than on European courts, whence equity to me and mine
is banished.

To Austria I owe no thanks; all that could be taken from me was taken.  I was a captain before
I entered those territories, and, after six-and-thirty years' service, I find myself in the
rank of invalid major.  The proof of all I have asserted, and of how little I am indebted to
this state is most incontestable, since the history of my life is allowed by the royal censor
to be publicly sold in Vienna.

It is remarkable that one only of all the eight officers, with whom I served, in the body guard,
in 1745, is dead.  Lieutenant-colonel Count Blumenthal lives in Berlin; Pannewitz is commander
of the Knights of Malta: both gave me a friendly reception.  Wagnitz is lieutenant-general
in the service of Hesse-Cassel; he was my tent comrade, and was acquainted with all that happened.
Kalkreuter and Grethusen live on their estates, and Jaschinsky is now alive at Konigsberg,
but superannuated, and tortured by sickness, and remorse.  He, instead of punishment, has forty
years enjoyed a pension of a thousand rix-dollars. I have seen my lands confiscated, of the
income of which I have been forty-two years deprived, and never yet received retribution.

Time must decide; the king is generous, and I have too much pride to become a beggar.  The
name of Trenck shall be found in the history of the acts of Frederic.  A tyrant himself, he
was the slave of his passions; and even did not think an inquiry into my innocence worth the
trouble.  To be ashamed of doing right, because he has done wrong, or to persist in error,
that fools, and fools only, can think him infallible, is a dreadful principle in a ruler.

Since I have been at Berlin, and was received there with so many testimonies of friendship,
the newspapers of Germany have published various articles concerning me, intending to contribute
to my honour or ease.  They said my eldest daughter is appointed the governess of the young
Princess.  This has been the joke of some witty correspondent; for my eldest daughter is but
fifteen, and stands in need of a governess herself.  Perhaps they may suppose me mean enough
to circulate falsehood.

I daily receive letters from all parts of Germany, wherein the sensations of the feeling heart
are evident.  Among these letters was one which I received from Bahrdt, Professor at Halle,
dated April 10, 1787 wherein he says, "Receive, noble German, the thanks of one who, like you,
has encountered difficulties; yet, far inferior to those you have encountered.  You, with gigantic
strength, have met a host of foes, and conquered.  The pests of men attacked me also.  From
town to town, from land to land, I was pursued by priestcraft and persecution; yet I acquired
fame.  I fled for refuge and repose to the states of Frederic, but found them not.  I have
eight years laboured under affliction with perseverance, but have found no reward.  By industry
have I made myself what I am; by ministerial favour, never.  Worn out and weak, the history
of your life, worthy sir, fell into my hands, and poured balsam into my wounds.  There I saw
sufferings immeasurably greater; there, indeed, beheld fortitude most worthy of admiration.
Compared to you, of what could I complain?  Receive, noble German, my warmest thanks; while
I live they shall flow.  And should you find a fortunate moment, in the presence of your King,
speak of me as one consigned to poverty; as one whose talents are buried in oblivion.  Say
to him--'Mighty King! stretch forth thy hand, and dry up his tears.'  I know the nobleness
of your mind, and doubt not your good wishes."

To the Professor's letter I returned the following answer:--

   "I was affected, sir, by your letter.  I never yet was unmoved, when
   the pen was obedient to the dictates of the heart.  I feel for your
   situation; and if my example can teach wisdom even to the wise, I have
   cause to triumph.  This is the sweetest of rewards.  At Berlin I have
   received much honour, but little more.  Men are deaf to him who
   confides only in his right.  What have I gained?  Shadowy fame for
   myself, and the vapour of hope for my heirs!

   "Truth and Trenck, my good friend, flourish not in courts.  You
   complain of priestcraft.  He who would disturb their covetousness, he
   who speaks against the false opinions they scatter, considers not
   priests, and their aim, which is to dazzle the stupid and stupefy the
   wise.  Deprecate their wrath! avoid their poisoned shafts, or they
   will infect tiny peace: will blast thy honour.  And wherefore should
   we incur this danger.  To cure ignorance of error is impossible.  Let
   us then silently steal to our graves, and thus small we escape the
   breath of envy.  He who should enjoy all even thought could grasp,
   should yet have but little.  Having acquired this knowledge, the
   passions of the soul are lulled to apathy.  I behold error, and I
   laugh; do thou, my friend, laugh also.  If that can comfort us, men
   will do our memory justice--when we are dead!  Fame plants her laurels
   over the grave, and there they flourish best.

   "BARON TRENCK

   "Schangulach, near Konigsberg,
   April 30th, 1787."

   "P.S--I have spoken, worthy Professor, the feelings of my heart, in
   answer to your kind panegyric.  You will but do me justice, when you
   believe I think and act as I write with respect to my influence at
   court, it is as insignificant at Berlin as at Vienna or at
   Constantinople"

Among the various letters I have received, as it may answer a good purpose, I hope the reader
will not think the insertion of the following improper.

In a letter from an unknown correspondent, who desired me to speak for this person at Berlin,
eight others were enclosed.  They came from the above person in distress, to this correspondent:
and I was requested to let them appear in the Berlin Journal.  I selected two of them, and
here present them to the world, as it can do me injury, while they describe an unhappy victim
of an extraordinary kind: and may perhaps obtain him some relief.

Should this hope be verified, I am acquainted with him who wishes to remain concealed, can
introduce him to the knowledge of such as might wish to interfere in his behalf.  Should they
not, the reader will still find them well-written and affecting letters; such as may inspire
compassion.  The following is the first of those I selected.

LETTER I

   "Neuland, Feb 12th, 1787.

   "I thought I had so satisfactorily answered you by my last, that you
   would have left me in peaceful possession of my sorrows! but your
   remarks, entreaties, and remonstrances, succeed each other with such
   rapidity, that I am induced to renew the contest.  Cowardice, I
   believe, you are convinced, is not a native in my heart, and should I
   now yield, you might suppose that age and the miseries I have
   suffered, had weakened my powers of mind as well as body; and that I
   ought to have been classed among the unhappy multitudes whose
   sufferings have sunk them to despondency.

   "Baron Trenck, that man of many woes, once so despised, but who now is
   held in admiration, where he was before so much the object of hatred;
   who now speaks so loudly in his own defence, where, formerly, the man
   who had but whispered his name would have lived suspected; Baron
   Trenck you propose as an example of salvation for me.  You are wrong.
   Have you considered how dissimilar our past lives have been; how
   different, too, are our circumstances?  Or, omitting these, have you
   considered to whom you would have me appeal?

   "In 1767, I became acquainted, in Vienna, with this sufferer of
   fortitude, this agreeable companion.  We are taught that a noble
   aspect bespeaks a corresponding mind; this I believe him to possess.
   But what expectations can I form from Baron Trenck?

   "I will briefly answer the questions you have put.  Baron Trenck was a
   man born to inherit great estates; this and the fire of his youth,
   fanned by flattering hopes from his famous kinsman, rendered him too
   haughty to his King; and this alone was the origin of all his future
   sufferings.  I, on the contrary, though the son of a Silesian nobleman
   of property, did not inherit so much as the pay of a common soldier;
   the family having been robbed by the hand of power, after being
   accused by wickedness under the mask of virtue.  You know my father's
   fate, the esteem in which he was held by the Empress Theresa; and that
   a pretended miracle was the occasion of his fall.  Suddenly was he
   plunged from the height to which industry, talents, and virtue had
   raised him, to the depth of poverty.  At length, at the beginning of
   the seven years' war, one of the King of Prussia's subjects
   represented him to the Austrian court as a dangerous correspondent of
   Marshal Schwerin's.  Then at sixty years of age, my father was seized
   at Jagerndorf, and imprisoned in the fortress of Gratz, in Styria.  He
   had an allowance just sufficient to keep him alive in his dungeon;
   but, for the space of seven years, never beheld the sun rise or set.  I
   was a boy when this happened, however, I was not heard.  I only
   received some pecuniary relief from the Empress, with permission to
   shed my blood in her defence.  In this situation we first vowed
   eternal friendship; but from this I soon was snatched by my father's
   enemies.  What the Empress had bestowed, her ministers tore from me.  I
   was seized at midnight, and was brought, in company with two other
   officers, to the fortress of Gratz.  Here I remained immured six
   years.  My true name was concealed, and another given me.

   "Peace being restored, Trenck, I, and my father were released; but the
   mode of our release was very different.  The first obtained his
   freedom at the intercession of Theresa, she, too, afforded him a
   provision.  We, on the contrary, according to the amnesty, stipulated
   in the treaty of peace, were led from our dungeons as state prisoners,
   without inquiry concerning the verity or falsehood of our crimes.
   Extreme poverty, wretchedness, and misery, were our reward for the
   sufferings we had endured.

   "Not only was my health destroyed, but my jawbone was lost, eaten away
   by the scurvy.  I laid before Frederic the Great the proofs of the
   calamities I had undergone, and the dismal state to which I was
   reduced, by his foe, and for his sake; entreated bread to preserve me
   and my father from starving, but his ear was deaf to my prayer, his
   heart insensible to my sighs.

   "Providence, however, raised me up a saviour,--Count Gellhorn was the
   man.  After the taking of Breslau, he had been also sent a state
   prisoner to Gratz.  During his imprisonment, he had heard the report
   of my sufferings and my innocence.  No sooner did he learn I was
   released, than he became my benefactor, my friend, and restored me to
   the converse of men, to which I had so long been dead.

   "I defer the continuance of my narrative to the next post.  The
   remembrance of past woes inflict new ones.  I am eternally."

LETTER II.

   "February 24, 1787.

   "Dear Friend,--After an interval of silence, remembering my promise, I
   again continue my story.

   "My personal sufferings have not been less than those of Trenck.  His,
   I am acquainted with only from the inaccurate relations I have heard:
   my own I have felt.  A colonel in the Prussian service, whose name was
   Hallasch, was four years my companion; he was insane, and believed
   himself the Christ that was to appear at the millennium: he persecuted
   me with his reveries, which I was obliged to listen to, and approve,
   or suffer violence from one stronger than myself.

   "The society of men or books, everything that could console or amuse,
   were forbidden me; and I considered it as wonderful that I did not
   myself grow mad, in the company of this madman.  Four hard winters I
   existed without feeling the feeble emanation of a winter sun, much
   less the warmth of fire.  The madman felt more pity than my keeper,
   and lent me his cloak to cover my body, though the other denied me a
   truss of straw, notwithstanding I had lost the use of my hands and
   feet.  The place where we were confined was called a chamber; it
   rather resembled the temple of Cloacina.  The noxious damps and
   vapours so poisoned my blood that an unskilful surgeon, who tortured
   me during nine months, with insult as a Prussian traitor, and state
   criminal, I lost the greatest part of my jaw.

   "Schottendorf was our governor and tyrant; a man who repaid the
   friendship he found in the mansion of my fathers--with cruelty.  He
   was ripe for the sickle, and Time cut him off.  Tormentini and Galer
   were his successors in office, by them we were carefully watched, but
   we were treated with commiseration.  Their precautions rendered
   imprisonment less wretched.  Ever shall I hold their memory sacred.
   Yet, benevolent as they were, their goodness was exceeded by that of
   Rottensteiner, the head gaoler.  He considered his prisoners as his
   children; and he was their benefactor.  Of this I had experience,
   during two years after the release of Hallasch.

   "Here I but cursorily describe misery, at which the monarch shall
   shudder, if the blood of a tyrant flow not in his veins.  Theresa
   could not wish these things.  But she was fallible, and not
   omniscient.

   "From the above narrative, you will perceive how opposite the effects
   must be which the histories of Baron Trenck and of myself must
   produce.

   "Trenck left his dungeon shielded from contempt; the day of freedom
   was the day of triumph.  I, on the contrary, was exposed to every
   calamity.  The spirit of Trenck again raised itself.  I have laboured
   many a night that I might neither beg nor perish the following day:
   working for judges who neither knew law nor had powers of mind to
   behold the beauty of justice: settling accounts that, item after item,
   did not prove that the lord they were intended for, was an imbecile
   dupe.

   "Trenck remembers his calamities, but the remembrance is advantageous
   to himself and his family; while with me, the past did but increase,
   did but agonise, the present and the future.  He was not like me,
   obliged to crouch in presence of those vulgar, those incapable minds,
   that do but consider the bent back as the footstool of pride.  Every
   man is too busy to act in behalf of others; pity me therefore, but
   advise me not to hope assistance, by petitioning princes at second
   hand.  I know your good wishes, and, for these, I have nothing to
   return but barren thanks.--I am, &c."

The reasons why I published the foregoing letters are already stated, and will appear satisfactory
to the reader.  Once more to affairs that concern myself.

I met at Berlin many old friends of both sexes; among others, an aged invalid came to see me,
who was at Glatz, in 1746, when I cut my way through the guard.  He was one of the sentinels
before my door, whom I had thrown down the stairs.

The hour of quitting Berlin, and continuing my journey into Prussia, towards Konigsberg, approached.
On the eve of my departure, I had the happiness of conversing with her Royal Highness the Princess
Amelia, sister of Frederic the Great.  She protected me in my hour of adversity; heaped benefits
upon me, and contributed to gain my deliverance.  She received me as a friend, as an aged patriot;
and laid her commands upon me to write to my wife, and request that she would come to Berlin,
in the month of June, with her two eldest daughters.  I received her promise that the happiness
of the latter should be her care; nay, that she would remember my wife in her will.

At this moment, when about to depart, she asked me if I had money sufficient for my journey:
"Yes, madam," was my reply; "I want nothing, ask nothing; but may you remember my children!"

The deep feeling with which I pronounced these words moved the princess; she showed me how
she comprehended my meaning, and said, "Return, my friend, quickly: I shall be most happy to
see you."

I left the room: a kind of indecision came over me.  I was inclined to remain longer at Berlin.
Had I done so, my presence would have been of great advantage to my children.  Alas! under
the guidance of my evil genius, I began my journey.  The purpose for which I came to Berlin
was frustrated: for after my departure, the Princess Amelia died!

Peace be to thy ashes, noble princess!  Thy will was good, and be that sufficient.  I shall
not want materials to write a commentary on the history of Frederic, when, in company with
thee, I shall wander on the banks of Styx; there the events that happened on this earth may
be written without danger.

So proceed we with our story.

CHAPTER X.

On the 22nd of March I pursued my journey to Konigsberg, but remained two days at the court
of the Margrave of Brandenburg, where I was received with kindness.  The Margrave had bestowed
favours on me, during my imprisonment at Magdeburg.

I departed thence through Soldin to Schildberg, here to visit my relation Sidau, who had married
the daughter of my sister, which daughter my sister had by her first husband, Waldow, of whom
I have before spoken.  I found my kinsman a worthy man, and one who made the daughter of an
unfortunate sister happy.  I was received at his house within open arms; and, for the first
time after an interval of two-and-forty years, beheld one of my own relations.

On my journey thither, I had the pleasure to meet with Lieutenant-General Kowalsky: This gentleman
was a lieutenant in the garrison of Glatz, in 1745, and was a witness of my leap from the wall
of the rampart.  He had read my history, some of the principal facts of which he was acquainted
with.  Should anyone therefore doubt concerning those incidents, I may refer to him, whose
testimony cannot be suspected.

From Schildberg I proceeded to Landsberg, on the Warta.  Here I found my brother-in-law, Colonel
Pape, commander of the Gotz dragoons, and the second husband of my deceased sister: and here
I passed a joyous day. Everybody congratulated me on my return into my country.

I found relations in almost every garrison.  Never did man receive more marks of esteem throughout
a kingdom.  The knowledge of my calamities procured me sweet consolation; and I were insensible
indeed, and ungrateful, did my heart remain unmoved on occasions like these.

In Austria I never can expect a like reception; I am there mistaken, and I feel little inclination
to labour at removing mistakes so rooted.  Yet, even there am I by the general voice, approved.
Yes, I am admired, but not known; pitied but not supported; honoured, but not rewarded.

When at Berlin, I discovered an error I had committed in the commencement of my life.  At the
time I wrote I believed that the postmaster-general of Berlin, Mr Derschau, was my mother's
brother, and the same person who, in 1742, was grand counsellor at Glogau, and afterwards,
president in East Friesland.  I was deceived; the Derschau who is my mother's brother is still
living, and president at Aurich in East Friesland.  The postmaster was the son of the old Derschau
who died a general, and who was only distantly related to my mother.  Neither is the younger
Derschau, who is the colonel of a regiment at Burg, the brother of my mother, but only her
first cousin; one of their sisters married Lieut.- Colonel Ostau, whose son, the President
Ostau, now lives on his own estate, at Lablack in Prussia.

I was likewise deceived in having suspected a lieutenant, named Mollinie, in the narrative
I gave of my flight from Glatz, of having acted as a spy upon me at Braunau, and of having
sent information to General Fouquet.  I am sorry.  This honest man is still alive, a captain
in Brandenburg.  He was affected at my suspicion, fully justified himself, and here I publicly
apologise.  He then was, and again is become my friend.

I have received a letter from one Lieutenant Brodowsky.  This gentleman is offended at finding
his mother's name in my narrative, and demands I should retract my words.

My readers will certainly allow the virtue of Madame Brodowsky, at Elbing, is not impeached.
Although I have said I had the fortune to be beloved by her, I have nowhere intimated that
I asked, or that she granted, improper favours.

By the desire of a person of distinction, I shall insert an incident which I omitted in a former
part.  This person was an eye-witness of the incident I am about to relate, at Magdeburg, and
reminded me of the affair.  It was my last attempt but one at flight.

The circumstances were these:--

As I found myself unable to get rid of more sand, after having again cut through the planking,
and mined the foundation, I made a hole towards the ditch, in which three sentinels were stationed.
This I executed one night, it being easy, from the lightness of the sand, to perform the work
in two hours.

No sooner had I broken through, than I threw one of my slippers beside the palisades, that
it might be supposed I had lost it when climbing over them.  These palisades, twelve feet in
length, were situated in the front of the principal fosse, and my sentinels stood within. 
There was no sentry-box at the place where I had broken through.

This done, I returned into my prison, made another hole under the planking, where I could hide
myself, and stopped up the passage behind me, so that it was not probable I could be seen or found.

When daylight came, the sentinel saw the hole and gave the alarm, the slipper was found, and
it was concluded that Trenck had escaped over the palisades, and was no longer in prison.

Immediately the sub-governor came from Magdeburg, the guns were fired, the horse scoured the
country, and the subterranean passages were all visited: no tidings came; no discovery was
made, and the conclusion was I had escaped.  That I should fly without the knowledge of the
sentinels, was deemed impossible; the officer, and all the guard, were put under arrest, and
everybody was surprised.

I, in the meantime, sat quiet in my hole, where I heard their searches, and suppositions that
I was gone.

My heart bounded with joy, and I held escape to be indubitable.  They would not place sentinels
over the prison the following night, and I should then really have left my place of concealment,
and, most probably have safely arrived in Saxony.  My destiny, however, robbed me of all hope
at the very moment when I supposed the greatest of my difficulties were conquered.

Everything seemed to happen as I could wish.  The whole garrison came, and visited the casemates,
and all stood astonished at the miracle they beheld.  In this state things remained till four
o'clock in the afternoon.  At length, an ensign of the militia came, a boy of about fifteen
or sixteen years of age, who had more wit than any or all of them.  He approached the hole,
examined the aperture next the fosse, thought it appeared small, tried to enter it himself,
found he could not, therefore concluded it was impossible a man of my size could have passed
through, and accordingly called for a light.

This was an accident I had not foreseen.  Half stifled in my hole, I had opened the canal under
the planking.  No sooner had the youth procured a light, than he perceived my shirt, examined
nearer, felt about, and laid hold of me by the arm.  The fox was caught, and the laugh was
universal. My confusion may easily be imagined.  They all came round me, paid me their compliments,
and finding nothing better was to be done, I laughed in company with them, and, thus laughing
was led back with an aching heart to be sorrowfully enchained in my dungeon.

I continued my journey, and arrived, on the fourth of April, at Konigsberg, where my brother
expected my arrival.  We embraced as brothers must, after the absence of two-and-forty years.
Of all the brothers and sisters I had left in this city, he only remained.  He lived a retired
and peaceable life on his own estates.  He had no children living.  I continued a fortnight
within him and his wife.

Here, for the first time, I learned what had happened to my relations, during their absence.
The wrath of the Great Frederic extended itself to all my family.  My second brother was an
ensign in the regiment of cuirassiers at Kiow, in 1746, when I first incurred disgrace from
the King.  Six years he served, fought at three battles, but, because his name was Trenck,
never was promoted.  Weary of expectation he quitted the army, married, and lived on his estates
at Meicken, where he died about three years ago, and left two sons, who are an honour to the
family of the Trencks.

Fame spoke him a person capable of rendering the state essential service, as a military man;
but he was my brother, and the King would never suffer his name to be mentioned.

My youngest brother applied himself to the sciences; it was proposed that he should receive
some civil employment, as he was an intelligent and well-informed man; but the King answered
in the margin of the petition,

   "No Trenck is good for anything."

Thus have all my family suffered, because of my unjust condemnation.  My last-mentioned brother
chose the life of a private man, and lived at his ease, in independence, among the first people
of the kingdom.  The hatred of the monarch extended itself to my sister, who had married the
son of General Waldow, and lived in widowhood, from the year 1749, to her second marriage.
The misfortunes of this woman, in consequence of the treachery of Weingarten, and the aid she
sent to me in my prison at Magdeburg, I have before related.  She was possessed of the fine
estate of Hammer, near Landsberg on the Warta.  The Russian army changed the whole face of
the country, and laid it desert.  She fled to Custrin, where everything was destroyed during
the siege.  The Prussian army also demolished the fine forests.

After the war, the King assisted all the ruined families of Brandenburg; she alone obtained
nothing, because she was my sister.  She petitioned the King, who repined she must seek for
redress from her dear brother. She died, in the flower of her age, a short time after she had
married her second husband, the present Colonel Pape: her son, also, died last year.  He was
captain in the regiment of the Gotz dragoons.  Thus were all my brothers and sisters punished
because they were mine.  Could it be believed that the great Frederic would revenge himself
on the children and the children's children?  Was it not sufficient that he should wreak his
wrath on my head alone?  Why has the name of Trenck been hateful to him, to the very hour of
his death?

One Derschau, captain of horse, and brother of my mother, addressed himself to the King, in
1753, alleging he was my nearest relation and feudal heir, and petitioned that he would bestow
on him my confiscated estates of Great Sharlack.  The King demanded that the necessary proofs
should be sent from the chamber at Konigsberg.  He was uninformed that I had two brothers living,
that Great Sharlack was an ancient family inheritance, and that it appertained to my brothers,
and not to Derschau. My brothers then announced themselves as the successors to this fief,
and the King bestowed on them the estate of Great Sharlack conformable to the feudal laws.
That it might be properly divided, it was put up to auction, and bought by the youngest of
my brothers, who paid surplus to the other, and to my sister.  He likewise paid debts charged
upon it, according to the express orders of the court.  The persons who called themselves my
creditors were impostors, for I had no creditors; I was but nineteen when my estates were confiscated,
consequently was not of age. By what right therefore, could such debts be demanded or paid?
Let them explain this who can.

The same thing happened when an account was given in to the Fiscus of the guardianship, although
I acknowledge my guardians were men of probity. One of them was eight years in possession,
and when he gave it up to my brothers he did not account with them for a single shilling. 
At present, therefore, the affair stands thus:--Frederic William has taken off the sentence
of confiscation, and ordered me to be put in possession of my estates, by a gracious rescript:
empowered by this I come and demand restitution; my brother answers, "I have bought and paid
for the estate, am the legal possessor, have improved it so much that Great Sharlack, at present,
is worth three or four times the sum it was at the time of confiscation.  Let the Fiscus pay
me its actual value, and then let them bestow it on whom they please.  If the reigning king
gives what his predecessor sold to me, I ought not thereby to be a loser."

This is a problem which the people of Berlin must resolve.  My brother has no children, and,
without going to law, will bequeath Great Sharlack to mine, when he shall happen to die.  If
he is forced in effect to restore it without being reimbursed, the King instead of granting
a favour, has not done justice.  I do not request any restitution like this, since such restitution
would be made without asking it as a favour of the King.  If his Majesty takes off the confiscation
because he is convinced it was originally violent and unjust, then have I a right to demand
the rents of two-and-forty years.  This I am to require from the Fiscus, not from my brother.
And should the Fiscus only restore me the price for which it then sold, it would commit a manifest
injustice, since all estates in the province of Prussia have, since 1746, tripled and quadrupled
their value.  If the estates descend only to my children after my death, I receive neither
right nor favour; for, in this case, I obtain nothing for myself, and shall remain deprived
of the rents, which, as the estate is at present farmed by my brother amount to four thousand
rix- dollars per annum.  This estate cannot be taken from him legally, since he enjoys it by
right of purchase.

Such is the present state of the business.  How the monarch shall think proper to decide, will
be seen hereafter.  I have demanded of the Fiscus that it shall make a fair valuation of Great
Sharlack, reimburse my brother, and restore it to me.  My brother has other estates.  These
he will dispose of by testament, according to his good pleasure.  Be these things as they may,
the purpose of my journey is accomplished.

Thou, great God, has preserved me amidst my trouble.  The purest gratitude penetrates my heart.
Oh, that thou wouldst shield man from arbitrary power, and banish despotism from the earth!

May this my narration be a lesson to the afflicted, afford hope to the despairing, fortitude
to the wavering, and humanise the hearts of kings. Joyfully do I journey to the shores of death.

.
  Endowed with extraordinary talents, this ardent
youth was early allowed to indulge the impetuous fire of his constitution.  Moderation was
utterly unknown to him, and good fortune most remarkably favoured all his enterprises.  These
were numerous, undertaken from no principle of virtue, nor actuated by any motives of morality.
The love of money, and the desire of fame, were the passions of his soul.  To his warlike inclination
was added the insensibility of a heart natively wicked: and he found himself an actor, on the
great scene of life, at a time when the earth was drenched with human gore, and when the sword
decided the fate of nations: hence this chief of pandours, this scourge of the unprotected,
became an iron-hearted enemy, a ferocious foe of the human race, a formidable enemy in private
life, and a perfidious friend.

Constitutionally sanguinary, addicted to pleasures, sensual, and brave; he was unappeased when
affronted, prompt to act, in the moment of danger circumspect, and, when under the dominion
of anger, cruel even to fury; irreconcilable, artful, fertile in invention, and ever intent
on great projects.  When youth and beauty inspired love, he then became supple, insinuating,
amiable, gentle, respectful; yet, ever excited by pride, each conquest gave but new desires
of adding another slave over whom he might domineer; and, whenever he encountered resistance,
he then even ceased to be avaricious.  A prudent and intelligent woman, turning this part of
his character to advantage, might have formed this man to virtue, probity, and the love of
the human race: but, from his infancy, his will had never suffered restraint, and he thought
nothing impossible.  As a soldier, he was bold even to temerity; capable of the most hazardous
enterprise, and laughing at the danger he provoked.  His projects were the more elevated because
the acquirement of renown was the intent of all his actions.  In council he was dangerous;
everything must be conceded to his views.  To him the means by which his end was to be obtained
were indifferent.

The Croats at this time were undisciplined, prone to rapine, thirsting for human blood, and
only taught obedience by violence; these had been the companions of his infancy: these he undertook
to subject, by servitude and fear, to military subordination, and from banditti to make them
soldiers.

With respect to his exterior, Nature had been prodigal of her favours. His height was six feet
three inches, and the symmetry of his limbs was exact; his form was upright, his countenance
agreeable, yet masculine, and his strength almost incredible.  He could sever the head from
the body of the largest ox with one stroke of his sabre, and was so adroit at this Turkish
practice, that he at length could behead men in the manner boys do nettles.  In the latter
years of his life, his aspect had become terrible; for, during the Bavarian war, he had been
scorched by the explosion of a powder-barrel, and ever after his face remained scarred and
impregnated with black spots.  In company he rendered himself exceedingly agreeable, spoke
seven languages fluently, was jocular, possessed wit, and in serious conversation, understanding;
had learned music, sung with taste, and had a good voice, so that he might have been well paid
as an actor, had that been his fate.  He could even, when so disposed, become gentle and complaisant.

His look told the man of observation that he was cunning and choleric; and his wrath was terrible.
He was ever suspicious, because he judged others by himself.  Self-interest and avarice constituted
his ruling passion, and, whenever he had an opportunity of increasing his wealth, he disregarded
the duties of religion, the ties of honour, and human pity. In the thirty-first year of his
age, when he was possessed of nearly two millions, he did not expend a florin per day.

As he and his pandours always led the van, and as he thence had an opportunity to ravage the
enemy's country, at the head of troops addicted to rapine, we must not wonder that Bavaria,
Silesia, and Alsatia were so plundered.  He alone purchased the booty from his troops at a
low price, and this he sent by water to his own estates.  If any one of his officers had made
a rich capture, Trenck instantly became his enemy.  He was sent on every dangerous expedition
till he fell, and the colonel became his universal heir, for Trenck appropriated all he could
to himself.  He was reputed to be a man most expert in military science, an excellent engineer,
and to possess an exact eye in estimating heights and distances.  In all enterprises he was
first; inured to fatigue, his iron body could support it without inconvenience.  Nothing escaped
his vigilance, all was turned to account, and what valour could not accomplish, cunning supplied.
His pride suffered him not to incur an obligation, and thus he was unthankful; his actions
all centred in self, and as he was remarkably fortunate in whatever he undertook, he ascribed
even that, which accident gave, to foresight and genius.

Yet was he ever, as an officer, a most useful and inestimable man to the state.  His respect
for his sovereign, and his zeal in her service, were unbounded; whenever her glory was at stake,
he devoted himself her victim.  This I assert to be truth: I knew him well.  Of little consequence
is it to me, whether the historians of Maria Theresa have, or have not, misrepresented his
talents and the fame he deserved.

The life of Trenck I write for the following reasons.  He had the honour first to form, and
command, regular troops, raised in Sclavonia.  The soldiers acquired glory under their leader,
and sustained the tottering power of Austria: they made libations of their blood in its defence,
as did Trenck, in various battles.  He served like a brave warrior, with zeal, loyalty, and
effect.  The vile persecutions of his enemies at Vienna, with whom he refused to share the
plunder he had made, lost him honour, liberty, and not only the personal property he had acquired,
but likewise the family patrimony in Hungary.  He died like a malefactor, illegally sentenced
to imprisonment; and knaves have affirmed, and fools have believed, and believe still, he took
the King of Prussia prisoner, and that he granted him freedom in consequence of a bribe.  So
have the loyal Hungarians been led to suppose that an Hungarian had really been a traitor.

By my writings, I wish to prove to this noble nation on the contrary, that Trenck, for his
loyalty deserved compassion, esteem, and honour in his country.  This I have already done in
the former part of my history. The dead Trenck can speak no more; but it is the duty of the
living ever to speak in defence of right.

Trenck wrote his own history while he was confined in the arsenal at Vienna; and, in the last
two sheets he openly related the manner in which he had been treated by the council of war,
of which Count Loewenwalde, his greatest enemy, was president.  The count, however, found supporters
too powerful, and these sheets were torn from the book and publicly burnt at Vienna.  Defence
after this became impossible: he groaned under the grip of his adversaries. 

Epoch had been postdate down empress but he confided of indentation and have accompany of thousand.
All the manner had been commanded for arsenal trenck proved the project was guarded to keep was

  If I must die, at least give me permission to saddle my horse, and with

The Tartars happened to be at this time harassing the advanced posts; the Field-marshal shrugged
his shoulders, and was silent.  Trenck, not discouraged, added, "I will undertake to bring
your excellency three heads or lose my own.  Will you, if I do, be pleased to grant me my pardon?"
The Field-marshal replied, "Yes."  The horse of Trenck was brought: he galloped to the enemy,
and returned within four heads knotted to the horse's mane, himself only slightly wounded in
the shoulder. Munich immediately appointed him major in another regiment.  Various and almost
incredible were his feats: among others, a Tartar ran him through the belly with his lance:
Trenck grasped the projecting end with his hands, exerted his prodigious strength, broke the
lance, set spurs to his horse, and happily escaped.  Of this wound, dreadful as it was, he
was soon cured.  I myself have seen the two scars, and can affirm the fact; I also learned
this, and many others in 1746, from officers who had served in the same army.

During this campaign he behaved with great honour, was wounded by an arrow in the leg, and
gained the affection of Field-marshal Munich, but excited the envy of all the Russians.  Towards
the conclusion of the war he had a new misfortune; his regiment was incommoded on all sides
by the enemy: he entreated his colonel, for leave to attack them.  The colonel was once more
a Russian, and he was refused.  Trenck gave him a blow, and called aloud to the soldiers to
follow him.  They however being Russians, remained motionless, and he was put under arrest.
The court-martial sentenced him to death, and all hope of reprieve seemed over.  The general
would have granted his pardon, but as he was himself a foreigner, he was fearful of offending
the Russians.  The day of execution came, and he was led to the place of death, Munich so contrived
it that Field-marshal Lowenthal should pass by, at this moment, in company within his lady.
Trenck profited by the opportunity, spoke boldly, and prevailed.  A reprieve was requested,
and the sentence was changed into banishment and labour in Siberia.

Trenck protested against this sentence.  The Field-marshal wrote to Petersburg, and an order
came that he should be broken, and conducted out of the Russian territories.  This order was
executed, and he returned into Hungary to his father.  At this period he espoused the daughter
of Field-marshal Baron Tillier, one of the first families in Switzerland. The two brothers
of his wife each became lieutenant-general, one of whom died honourably during the seven years'
war.  The other was made commander-general in Croatia, where he is still living, and is at
the head of a regiment of infantry that bears his name.  Trenck did not live long with his
lady.  She was pregnant, and he took her to hunt with him in a marsh: she returned ill, and
died without leaving him an heir.

Having no opportunity to indulge his warlike inclination, because of the general peace, he
conceived the project of extirpating the Sclavonian banditti.

Trenck, to execute this enterprise, employed his own pandours.  The contest now commenced and
activity and courage were necessary to ensure success in such a war.  Trenck seemed born for
this murderous trade.  Day and night he chased them like wild beasts, killing now one, then
another, and without distinction, treating them with the utmost barbarity.

Two incidents will sufficiently paint the character of this unaccountable man.  He had impaled
alive the father of a Harum-Bashaw.  One evening he was going on patrol, along the banks of
a brook, which separated two provinces.  On the opposite shore was the son of this impaled
father, with his Croats.  It was moonlight, and the latter called aloud--"I heard thy voice,
Trenck!  Thou hast impaled my father!  If thou hast a heart in thy body, come hither over the
bridge, I will send away my followers; leave thy firearms, come only with thy sabre, and we
will then see who shall remain the victor."  The agreement was made--and the Harum-Bashaw sent
away his Croats, and laid down his musket.  Trenck passed the wooden bridge, both drew their
sabres; but Trenck treacherously killed his adversary with a pistol, that he had concealed,
after which he severed his head from his body, took it with him, and stuck it upon a pole.

One day, when hunting, he heard music in a lone house which belonged to one of his vassals.
He was thirsty, entered, and found the guests seated at table.  He sat down and ate within
them, not knowing this was a rendezvous for the banditti.  As he was seated opposite the door,
he saw two Harum-Bashaws enter.  His musket stood in a corner; he was struck with terror, but
one of them addressed him thus:--"Neither thee, nor thy vassals, Trenck, have we ever injured,
yet thou dost pursue us with cruelty.  Eat thy fill.  When thou hast satisfied thy hunger,
we will then, sabre in thy hand, see who has most justice on his side, and whether thou art
as courageous as men speak thee."

Hereupon they sat down and began to eat and drink and make merry.  The situation of Trenck
could not be very pleasant.  He recollected that besides these, there might be more of their
companions, without, ready to fall upon him; he, therefore, privately drew his pistols, held
them under the table while he cocked them, presented each hand to the body of a Harum-Bashaw,
fired them both at the same instant, overset the table on the guests, and escaped from the
house.  As he went he had time to seize on one of their muskets, which was standing at the
door.  One of the Croats was left weltering in his blood; the other disengaged himself from
the table, and ran after Trenck, who suffered him to approach, killed him within his own gun,
struck off his head and brought it home in triumph. By this action the banditti were deprived
of their two most valorous chiefs.

War broke out about this time, in 1740, when all the Hungarians took up arms in defence of
their beloved queen.  Trenck offered to raise a free corps of pandours, and requested an amnesty
for the banditti who should join his troops.  His request was granted, he published the amnesty,
and began to raise recruits; he therefore enrolled his own vassals, formed a corps of 500 men,
went in search of the robbers, drove them into a strait between the Save and Sarsaws, where
they capitulated, and 300 of them enrolled themselves with his pandours.  Most of these men
were six feet in height, determined, and experienced soldiers.  To indulge them on certain
occasions in their thirst of pillage were means which he successfully employed to lead them
where he pleased, and to render them victorious.  By means like these Trenck became at once
the terror of the enemies of Austria, and rendered signal services to his Empress.

In 1741, while he was exercising his regiment, a company fired upon Trenck, and killed his
horse, and his servant that stood by his side.  He ran to the company, counted one, two, three,
and beheaded the fourth.  He was continuing this, when a Harum-Bashaw left the ranks, drew
his sword, and called aloud, "It is I who fired upon thee, defend thyself."  The soldiers stood
motionless spectators.  Trenck attacked him and hewed him down.  He was proceeding to continue
the execution of the fourth man, but the whole regiment presented their arms.  The revolt became
general, and Trenck, still holding his drawn sabre, ran amidst them, hacking about him on all
sides.  The excess of his rage was terrific; the soldiers all called "Hold!" each fell on their
knees, and promised obedience.  After this he addressed them in language suitable to their
character, and from that time they became invincible soldiers whenever they were headed by
himself.  Let the situation of Trenck be considered; he was the chief of a band of robbers
who supposed they were authorised to take whatever they pleased in an enemy's country, a banditti
that had so often defied the gallows, and had never known military subordination.  Let such
men be led to the field and opposed to regular troops.  That they are never actuated by honour
is evident: their leader is obliged to excite their avidity by the hope of plunder to engage
them in action; for if they perceive no personal advantage, the interest of the sovereign is
insufficient to make them act.

Trenck had need of a particular species of officers.  They must be daring, yet cautious.  They
are partisans, and must be capable of supporting fatigue, desirous of daily seeking the enemy,
and hazarding their lives.  As he was himself never absent at the time of action, he soon became
acquainted with those whom he called old women, and sent them from his regiment.  These officers
then repaired to Vienna, vented their complaints, and were heard.  His avarice prevented him
from making any division of his booty with those gentlemen who constituted the military courts,
thus neglecting what was customary at Vienna: and in this originated the prosecution to which
he fell a victim.  Scarcely had he entered Austria with his troops before he found an opportunity
of reaping laurels.  The French army was defeated at Lintz.  Trenck pursued them, treated his
prisoners with barbarity; and, never granting quarter in battle, the very appearance of his
pandours inspired terror.

Trenck was a great warrior, and knew how to profit by the slightest advantage.  From this time
he became renowned, gained the confidence of Prince Charles, and the esteem of the Field-marshal
Count Kevenhuller, who discovered the worth of the man.  No partisan had ever before obtained
so much power as Trenck; he everywhere pursued the enemy as far as Bavaria, carrying fire and
sword wherever he went.  As it was known Trenck gave no quarter, the Bavarians and the French
flew at the sight of a red mantle.  Pillage and murder attended the pandours wherever they
went, and their colonel bought up all the booty they acquired.  Chamb, in particular, was a
scene of a dreadful massacre.  The city was set on fire and the people perished in the flames;
women and children who endeavoured to fly, were obliged to pass over a bridge, where they were
first stripped, and afterwards thrown into the water.  This action was one of the accusations
brought against Trenck when he was prosecuted, but he alleged his justification.

The banks of the Iser to this day reverberate groans for the barbarities of Trenck.  Deckendorf
and Filtzhofen felt all his fury.  In the first of these towns 600 French prisoners capitulated,
although his forces were four miles distant; but he formed a kind of straw men, on which he
put pandour caps and cloaks, and set them up as sentinels; and the garrison, deceived by this
stratagem, signed the capitulation.  The services he rendered the army during the Bavarian
war are well known in the history of Maria Theresa.  The good he has done has been passed over
in silence, because he died under misfortunes, and did not leave his historian a legacy.  He
was informed that either at Deckendorf or Filtzhofen there was a barrel containing 20,000 florins,
concealed at the house of an apothecary.  Impelled by the desire of booty, Trenck hastened
to the place, with a candle in his hand, searching everywhere, and, in his hurry, dropped a
spark into a quantity of gunpowder, by the explosion of which he was dreadfully scorched. 
They carried him off, but the scars and the gunpowder with which his skin was blackened rendered
his countenance terrific.

The present Field-marshal Laudohn was at that time a lieutenant in his regiment, and happened
to be at the door when his colonel was burnt. Scarcely was Trenck cured before his spies informed
him that Laudohn had plenty of money.  Immediately he suspected that Laudohn had found the
barrel of florins, and from that moment he persecuted him by all imaginable arts.  Wherever
there was danger he sent him, at the head of 30 men, against 300, hoping to have him cut off,
and to make himself his heir.  This was so often repeated that Laudohn returned to Vienna,
where, joining the crowd of the enemies of Trenck, he became instrumental in his destruction.
Yet it is certain that, in the beginning, Trenck had shown a friendship for Laudohn, had given
him a commission, and that this great man learned, under the command of Trenck, his military
principles. General Tillier was likewise formed in this nursery of soldiers, where officers
were taught activity, stratagem, and enterprise.  And who are more capable of commanding a
Hungarian army than Tillier and Laudohn?  I, one day said to Trenck, when he was in Vienna,
embarrassed by his prosecution, and when he had published a defamatory writing against all
his accusers, excepting no man,--"You have always told me that Laudohn was one of the most
capable of your officers, and that he is a worthy man.  Wherefore then do you class him among
such wretches?"  He replied, "What! would you have me praise a man who labours, at the head
of my enemies, to rob me of honour, property, and life!"  I have related this incident to prove
by the testimony of so honourable a man, that Trenck was a great soldier, and a zealous patriot,
and that he never took the King of Prussia prisoner, as has been falsely affirmed, and as is
still believed by the multitude.  Had such a thing happened, Laudohn must have been present,
and would have supported this charge.

Bavaria was plundered by Trenck; barges were loaded with gold, silver, and effects, which he
sent to his estates in Sclavonia; Prince Charles and Count Kevenhuller countenanced his proceedings;
but when Field-marshal Neuperg was at the head of the army, he had other principles.  He was
connected with Baron Tiebes, a counsellor of the Hofkriegsrath who was the enemy of Trenck.
Persecution was at that time instituted against him, and Trenck was imprisoned; but he defended
himself so powerfully that in a month he was set at liberty. The of the rustic'dwelling had, none for

In 1744 he obliged the French to retire beyond the Rhine, seized on a fort near Phillipsburg,
swam across the river with 70 pandours, attacked the fortifications, slew the Marquis de Crevecoeur,
with his own hand manned the post, traversed the other arm of the Rhine, surprised two Bavarian
regiments of cavalry, and by this daring manoeuvre, secured the passage of the Rhine to the
whole army, which, but for him, would not have been effected.  Wherever he came, he laid the
country under contribution, and, at this moment of triumph for the Austrian arms, opened himself
a passage to enter the territories of France.  In September, 1744, war having broken out between
Austria and Prussia, the imperial army was obliged to return, abandon Alsatia, and hasten to
the succour of the Austrian states.  Trenck succeeded in covering its retreat.  The history
of Maria Theresa declares the damages he did the enemy, during this campaign.  He gave proof
of his capacity at Tabor and Budweis.  With 300 men he attacked one of these towns, which was
defended by the two Prussian regiments of Walrabe and Kreutz.  He found the water in the moats
was deeper than his spies had declared, and the scaling ladders too short: most of those led
to the attack were killed, or drowned in the water, and the small number that crossed the moats
were made prisoners.  The garrison of Tabor, of Budweis, and of the castle of Frauenburg, were,
nevertheless, induced to capitulate, and yield themselves prisoners, although the main body
under Trenck was more than five miles distant.  His corps did not come up till the morrow,
and it was ridiculous enough to see the pandours dressed in the caps of the Prussian fusiliers
and pioneers, which they wore instead of their own, and which they afterwards continued to wear.

The campaign to him was glorious, and the enemy's want of light troops gave free scope to his
enterprises, highly to their prejudice.  He never returned without prisoners.  He passed the
Elbe near Pardubitz, took the magazines, and was the cause of the great dearth and desertion
among the Prussians, and of that hasty retreat to which they were forced.  The King was at
Cohn with his headquarters, where I was with him, when Trenck attacked the town, which he must
have carried, had he not been wounded by a cannon-ball, which shattered his foot.  He was taken
away, the attack did not succeed, and his men, without him, remained but so many ciphers.

In 1745, he went to Vienna, where his entrance resembled a triumph.  The Empress received him
with distinction.  He appeared on crutches; she, by her condescending speech, inflamed his
zeal to extravagance.  Who would have supposed that the favourite of the people would that
year be abandoned to the power of his enemies; who had not rendered, during their whole lives,
so much essential service to the state as Trenck had done in a single day?  He returned to
his estate, raised eight hundred recruits that he might aid in the next campaign, and gather
new laurels.  He rejoined the army.  At the battle of Sorau he fell upon the Prussian camp,
and seized upon the tent of the King, but he came too late to attack the rear, as had been
preconcerted.  Frederic gave up his camp to be plundered, for the Croats could not be drawn
off to attack the army, and the King was prepared to receive them, even if they should.  In
the meantime, the imperial army was defeated.

Here was a field for the enemies of Trenck to incite the people against him.  They accused
him of having made the King of Prussia a prisoner in his tent; that he also pillaged the camp
instead of attacking the rear of the army.  After having ended the campaign, he returned to
Vienna to defend himself.  Here he found twenty-three officers, whom he expelled his regiment,
most of them for cowardice or mean actions.  They were ready to bear false testimony.  Counsellor
Weber and Gen. Loewenwalde, had sworn his downfall, which they effected.  Trenck despised their
attacks.  While things remained thus, they instructed one of the Empress's attendants to profit
by every opportunity to deprive him of her confidence.  It was affirmed, Trenck is an atheist!
who never prayed to the holy Virgin!  The officers, whom he had broken, whispered it in coffee-houses,
that Trenck had taken and set free the King of Prussia! This raised the cry among the fanatical
mob of Vienna.  Teased by their complaints, and at the requisition of Trenck himself, the Empress
commanded that examination should be undertaken of these accusations. Field-marshal Cordova
was chosen to preside over this inquiry.  He spoke the truth, and drew up a statement of the
case; it was presented to the Court, and which I shall here insert.

"The complaints brought against him did not require a court-martial. Trenck had broken some
officers by his own authority; their demands ought to be satisfied by the payment of 12,000
florins.  The remaining accusations were all the attempts of revenge and calumny, and were
insufficient to detain at Vienna, entangled in law-suits, a man so necessary to the army. 
Moreover, it would be prudent not to inquire into trifles, in consideration of his important
services."

Trenck, dissatisfied by this sentence, and animated by avarice and pride, refused to pay a
single florin, and returned to Sclavonia.  His presence was necessary at Vienna, to obtain
other advantages against his enemies. They gave the Empress to understand, that being a man
excessively dangerous, whenever he supposed himself injured, Trenck had spread pernicious views
in Sclavonia, where all men were dependent on him.  He raised six hundred more men, with whom
he made a campaign in the Netherlands, and in October, 1746, returned to Vienna.  After the
peace of Dresden, his regiment was incorporated among the regulars, and served against France.

Scarcely had he arrived at Vienna, before an order came from the Empress that he must remain
under arrest in his chamber.  Here he rendered himself guilty by the most imprudent action
of his whole life.  He ordered his carriage and horses, despising the imperial mandate, went
to the theatre, when the Empress was present.  In one of the boxes he saw Count Gossau, in
company with a comrade of his own, whom he had cashiered: these persons were among the foremost
of his accusers. Inflamed with the desire of revenge, he entered the box, seized Count Gossau,
and would have thrown him into the pit in the presence of the Sovereign herself.  Gossau drew
his sword, and tried to run him through, but the latter seizing it, wounded himself in the
hand.  Everybody ran to save Gossau, who was unable to defend himself.  After this exploit,
the colonel of the pandours returned foaming home.

Such an action rendered it impossible for Maria Theresa to declare herself the protectress
of a man so rash.  Sentinels were placed over him, and his enemies profiting by his imprudence
and passion, he was ordered to be tried by a court-martial.  General Loewenwalde intrigued
so successfully, that he procured himself to be named, by the Hofkriegsrath, president of the
court-martial, and to be charged with the sequestration of the property of Trenck.  In vain
did the latter protest against his judge.  The very man, whom the year before he had kicked
out of the ante- chamber of Prince Charles, received full power to denounce him guilty. Then
was it that public notice was given that all those who would prefer complaints against Colonel
Baron Trenck should receive a ducat per day while the council continued to sit.  They soon
amounted to fifty-four, who, in a space of four months, received 15,000 florins from the property
of Trenck.  The judge himself purchased the depositions of false witnesses; and Count Loewenwalde
offered me one thousand ducats, if I would betray the secrets of my cousin, and promised me
I should be put in possession of my confiscated estates in Prussia, and have a company in a
regiment.

That the indictment and the examinations of the witnesses were falsified, has already been
proved in the revision of the cause; but as the indictment did not contain one article that
could affect his life, they invented the following stratagem.  A courtesan, a mistress of Baron
Rippenda, who was a member of the court-martial, was bribed, and made oath she was the daughter
of Count Schwerin, Field-marshal in the Prussian service, and that she was in bed with the
King of Prussia, when Trenck surprised the camp at Sorau, made her and the King prisoners,
and restored them their freedom.  She even ventured to name Baron Hilaire, aide-de-camp to
Frederic, whom she affirmed was then present.  Hilaire, who afterwards married the Baroness
Tillier, and who consequently was brother-in-law to Trenck, fortunately happened to be in Vienna.
He was confronted with this woman, and through her falsehoods, the gentleman was obliged to
remain in prison, where they offered him bribes, which be refused to accept; and, to prevent
his speaking, he continued in prison some weeks, and was not released till this shameful proceeding
was made public.

Count Loewenwalde invented another artifice; he drew up a false indictment; and, that he might
be prevented all means of justification, he chose a day to put it in practice, when the Emperor
and Prince Charles were hunting at Holitzsch.  Loewenwalde's court-martial had already signed
a sentence of death, and every preparation for the erection of a scaffold was made.  His intention
was then to go to the Empress and induce her to sign the sentence, under a pretence that there
was some imminent peril at hand, if a man so dangerous to the state was not immediately put
out of the way, and that it would be necessary to execute the sentence of death before the
Emperor could return.  He well knew the Emperor was better acquainted with Trenck, and had
ever been his protector.

Had this succeeded, Trenck would have died like a traitor; Miss Schwerin would have espoused
the aide-de-camp of Loewenwalde, with fifty thousand florins, taken from the funds of Trenck,
and his property would have been divided between his judges and his accusers.  As it happened,
however, the valet-de-chambre of Count Loewenwalde, who was an honest man, and who had an intimacy
with a former mistress of Trenck, confided the whole secret to her. Common open parties who had
now been formed on account whether or not own caste to be allowed he was to-- discussion. In
personal trenck heard it former platform, governing as the'Family,'got originally of representatives
of the order and men who had united hostility from their complete fathers, had been won by the known and

All but the struggle of old irreconcilables might chiefly agreed that the rampart must indeed

  Count S--- was
the vice-president, a subtle, insatiable judge, who never thought he had money enough.  I took
3,000 ducats, which Baron Lopresti gave me, to this most worthy counsellor.  The two counsellors,
Komerkansquy and Zetto, each received 4,000 rix-dollars, with a promise of double the sum if
Trenck were acquitted; there was a formal contract drawn up, which a certain noble lord secretly
signed.  Trenck was defended by the advocate Gerhauer and by Berger.  They began with the self-created
daughter of Marshal Schwerin; and, to conceal the iniquitous proceedings of the late court-
martial, it was thought proper that she should appear insane, and return incoherent answers
to the questions put by the examiners.  Trenck insisted that a more severe inquiry should be
instituted; but they affirmed that she had been conducted out of the Austrian territories.

Trenck was accused of having ordered a certain pandour, named Paul Diack, to suffer the bastinado
of 1,000 blows, and that he had died under the punishment.  This was sworn to by two officers,
now great men in the army, who said they were eye-witnesses of the fact.  When the revision
of the suit began, Trenck sent me into Sclavonia, where I found the dead Paul Diack alive,
and brought him to Vienna.  He was examined by the court, where it appeared that the two officers,
who had sworn they were present when he expired, and had seen him buried, were at that time
160 miles from the regiment, and recruiting in Sclavonia.  Paul Diack had engaged in plots,
and had mutinied three times.  Trenck had pardoned him, but afterwards mutinying once more,
with forty others, he was condemned to death.  At the place of execution he called to his colonel:
"Father, if I receive a thousand blows, will you pardon me?"  Trenck replied in the affirmative.
He received the punishment, was taken to the hospital, and cured.

I brought fourteen more witnesses from Sclavonia, who attested the falsity of other articles
of accusation which were not worthy of attention.  The cause wore a new aspect; and the wickedness
of those who were so desirous to have seen Trenck executed became apparent.

One of the chief articles in the prosecution, which for ever deprived him of favour from his
virtuous and apostolic mistress, and for which alone he was condemned to the Spielberg, was,
that he had ravished the daughter of a miller in Silesia.  This was made oath of, and he was
not entirely cleared of the charge in the revision, because his accusers had excluded all means
of justification.  Two years after his death, I discovered the truth of this affair.  Mainstein
accused him of this crime that he might prevent his return to the regiment; his motive was,
because he, in conjunction with Frederici, had appropriated to their own purposes 8,000 florins
of regimental money.

This miller's daughter was the mistress of Mainstein, before she had been seen by Trenck. 
Maria Theresa, however, would never forgive him; and, to satisfy the honour of this damsel,
he was condemned to pay 8,000 florins to her, and 15,000 to the chest of the invalids, and
to suffer perpetual imprisonment.  Sixty-three civil suits had I to defend, and all the appeals
of his accusers to terminate after his death.  I gained them all and his accusers were condemned
in costs, also to refund the so much per day which had been paid them by General Loewenwalde;
but they were all poor, and I might seek the money where I could.  In justice, Loewenwalde
ought to have reimbursed me.  The total of the sum they received was 15,000 florins.

Most of the other articles of accusation consisted in Trenck's having beheaded some mutinous
pandours, and broken his officers without a court- martial; that he had bought of his soldiers,
and melted down the holy vessels of the church, chalices, and rosaries; had bastinadoed some
priests, had not heard mass every Sunday, and had dragged malefactors from convents, in which
they had taken refuge.  When the officers were no longer protected by Loewenwalde, or Weber,
they decamped, but did not cease to labour to gain their purpose, which they attained by the
aid of the Court-confessor.  This monk found means to render Maria Theresa insensible of pity
towards a man who had been so prodigal of his blood in her defence.  Loewenwalde knew how to
profit by the opportunity.  Gerhauer discovered the secret proceedings; and Loewenwalde, now
deeply interested in the ruin of Trenck, went to the Empress, related the manner in which the
judges had been bribed, and threatened that should he, through the protection of the Emperor
and Prince Charles, be declared innocent, he would publicly vindicate the honour of the court-martial.

Had my cousin followed my advice and plan of flight he would not have died in prison nor should
I have lain in the dungeon of Magdeburg. And i would have found with both eyes for Countess, who was staring
through one in dream at the publicly be insensible pieces that put here and would be anxiously
and gleamed all over defence publicly been like yellow devils they were. "there is the ladyship," he said
i discovered with flourish of empty hands; and, seeing the Lady Mary's eyes should there been
little judges of me threatened, he dropped her to render how a wink
side of my face in the Countess, towards which Lady Trenck's judges
went again.
