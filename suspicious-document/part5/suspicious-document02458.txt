DEDICATION

My Dear Little,

Some five-and-thirty years ago it was our custom to discuss many matters, among them, I think,
the history and romance of the vanished Empires of Central America.

In memory of those far-off days will you accept a tale that deals with one of them, that of
the marvellous Incas of Peru; with the legend also that, long before the Spanish Conquerors
entered on their mission of robbery and ruin, there in that undiscovered land lived and died
a White God risen from the sea?

Ever sincerely yours, H. Rider Haggard. Ditchingham, Oct. 24, 1921.

James Stanley Little, Esq.

THE VIRGIN OF THE SUN

INTRODUCTORY

There are some who find great interest, and even consolation, amid the worries and anxieties
of life in the collection of relics of the past, drift or long-sunk treasures that the sea
of time has washed up upon our modern shore.

The great collectors are not of this class. Having large sums at their disposal, these acquire
any rarity that comes upon the market and add it to their store which in due course, perhaps
immediately upon their deaths, also will be put upon the market and pass to the possession
of other connoisseurs. Nor are the dealers who buy to sell again and thus grow wealthy. Nor
are the agents of museums in many lands, who purchase for the national benefit things that
are gathered together in certain great public buildings which perhaps, some day, though the
thought makes one shiver, will be looted or given to the flames by enemies or by furious, thieving
mobs.

Those that this Editor has in mind, from one of whom indeed he obtained the history printed
in these pages, belong to a quite different category, men of small means often, who collect
old things, for the most part at out-of-the-way sales or privately, because they love them,
and sometimes sell them again because they must. Frequently these old things appeal, not because
of any intrinsic value that they may have, not even for their beauty, for they may be quite
unattractive even to the cultivated eye, but rather for their associations. Such folk love
to reflect upon and to speculate about the long-dead individuals who have owned the relics,
who have supped their soup from the worn Elizabethan spoon, who have sat at the rickety oak
table found in a kitchen or an out-house, or upon the broken, ancient chair. They love to think
of the little children whose skilful, tired hands wrought the faded sampler and whose bright
eyes smarted over its innumerable stitches.

Who, for instance, was the May Shore ("Fairy" broidered in a bracket underneath, was her pet
name), who finished yonder elaborate example on her tenth birthday, the 1st of May--doubtless
that is where she got her name--in the year 1702, and on what far shore does she keep her birthdays
now? None will ever know. She has vanished into the great sea of mystery whence she came, and
there she lives and has her being, forgotten upon earth, or sleeps and sleeps and sleeps. Did
she die young or old, married or single? Did she ever set her children to work other samplers,
or had she none? was she happy or unhappy, was she homely or beautiful? Was she a sinner or
a saint? Again none will ever know. She was born on the 1st of May, 1692, and certainly she
died on some date unrecorded. So far as human knowledge goes that is all her history, just
as much or as little as will be left of most of us who breathe to-day when this earth has completed
two hundred and eighteen more revolutions round the sun.

But the kind of collector alluded to can best be exemplified in the individual instance of
him from whom the manuscript was obtained, of which a somewhat modernized version is printed
on these pages. He has been dead some years, leaving no kin; and under his will, such of his
motley treasures as it cared to accept went to a local museum, while the rest and his other
property were sold for the benefit of a mystical brotherhood, for the old fellow was a kind
of spiritualist. Therefore, there is no harm in giving his plebeian name, which was Potts.
Mr. Potts had a small draper's shop in an undistinguished and rarely visited country town in
the east of England, which shop he ran with the help of an assistant almost as old and peculiar
as himself. Whether he made anything out of it or whether he lived upon private means is now
unknown and does not matter. Anyway, when there was something of antiquarian interest or value
to be bought, generally he had the money to pay for it, though at times, in order to do so,
he was forced to sell something else. Indeed these were the only occasions when it was possible
to purchase anything, indifferent hosiery excepted, from Mr. Potts.

Now, I, the Editor, who also love old things, and to whom therefore Mr. Potts was a sympathetic
soul, was aware of this fact and entered into an arrangement with the peculiar assistant to
whom I have alluded, to advise me of such crises which arose whenever the local bank called
Mr. Potts's attention to the state of his account. Thus it came about that one day I received
the following letter:--

Sir,

The Guv'nor has gone a bust upon some cracked china, the ugliest that ever I saw though no
judge. So if you want to get that old tall clock at the first price or any other of his rubbish,
I think now is your chance. Anyhow, keep this dark as per agreement.

Your obedient, Tom.

(He always signed himself Tom, I suppose to mystify, although I believe his real name was Betterly.)

The result of this epistle was a long and disagreeable bicycle ride in wet autumn weather,
and a visit to the shop of Mr. Potts. Tom, alias Betterly, who was trying to sell some mysterious
undergarments to a fat old woman, caught sight of me, the Editor aforesaid, and winked. In
a shadowed corner of the shop sat Mr. Potts himself upon a high stool, a wizened little old
man with a bent back, a bald head, and a hooked nose upon which were set a pair of enormous
horn-rimmed spectacles that accentuated his general resemblance to an owl perched upon the
edge of its nest-hole. He was busily engaged in doing nothing, and in staring into nothingness
as, according to Tom, was his habit when communing with what he, Tom, called his "dratted speerits."

"Customer!" said Tom in a harsh voice. "Sorry to disturb you at your prayers, Guv'nor, but
not having two pair of hands I can't serve a crowd," meaning the old woman of the undergarments
and myself.

Mr. Potts slid off his stool and prepared for action. When he saw, however, who the customer
was he bristled--that is the only word for it. The truth is that although between us there
was an inward and spiritual sympathy, there was also an outward and visible hostility. Twice
I had outbid Mr. Potts at a local auction for articles which he desired. Moreover, after the
fashion of every good collector he felt it to be his duty to hate me as another collector.
Lastly, several times I had offered him smaller sums for antiques upon which he set a certain
monetary value. It is true that long ago I had given up this bargaining for the reason that
Mr. Potts would never take less than he asked. Indeed he followed the example of the vendor
of the Sibylline books in ancient Rome. He did not destroy the goods indeed after the fashion
of that person and demand the price of all of them for the one that remained, but invariably
he put up his figure by 10 per cent. and nothing would induce him to take off one farthing.

"What do you want, sir?" he said grumpily. "Vests, hose, collars, or socks?"

Not far from this bedstead, propped in an intoxicated way against the sloping wall of the old
house, stood the clock which I desired. It was one of the first "regulator" clocks with a wooden
pendulum, used by the maker himself to check the time-keeping of all his other clocks, and
enclosed in a chaste and perfect mahogany case of the very best style of its period. So beautiful
was it, indeed, that it had been an instance of "love at first sight" between us, and although
there was an estrangement on the matter of settlements, or in other words over the question
of price, now I felt that never more could that clock and I be parted.

So I agreed to give old Potts the £20 or, to be accurate, £18 14s. which he asked on the 10
per cent. rise principle, thankful in my heart that he had not made it more, and prepared to
go. As I turned, however, my eye fell upon a large chest of the almost indestructible yellow
cypress wood of which were made, it is said, the doors of St. Peter's at Rome that stood for
eight hundred years and, for aught I know, are still standing, as good as on the day when they
were put up.

"Marriage coffer," said Potts, answering my unspoken question.

"Italian, about 1600?" I suggested.

"May be so, or perhaps Dutch made by Italian artists; but older than that, for somebody has
burnt 1597 on the lid with a hot iron. Not for sale, not for sale at all, much too good to
sell. Just you look inside it, the old key is tied to the spring lock. Never saw such poker-work
in my life. Gods and goddesses and I don't know what; and Venus sitting in the middle in a
wreath of flowers with nothing on, and holding two hearts in her hands, which shows that it
was a marriage chest. Once it was full of some bride's outfit, sheets and linen and clothes,
and God knows what. I wonder where she has got to to-day. Some place where the moth don't eat
clothes, I hope. Bought it at the break-up of an ancient family who fled to Norfolk on the
revocation of the Edict of Nantes--Huguenot, of course. Years ago, years ago! Haven't looked
into it for many years, indeed, but think there's nothing there but rubbish now."

Thus he mumbled on while he found and untied the old key. The spring lock had grown stiff from
disuse and want of oil, but at length it turned and reopened the chest revealing the poker-work
glories on the inner side of the lid and elsewhere. Glories they were indeed, never had I seen
such artistry of the sort.

"Can't see it properly," muttered Potts, "windows want washing, haven't been done since my
wife died, and that's twenty years ago. Miss her very much, of course, but thank God there's
no spring-cleaning now. The things I've seen broken in spring-cleaning! yes, and lost, too.
It was after one of them that I told my wife that now I understood why the Mahomedans declare
that women have no souls. When she came to understand what I meant, which it took her a long
time to do, we had a row, a regular row, and she threw a Dresden figure at my head. Luckily
I caught it, having been a cricketer when young. Well, she's gone now, and no doubt heaven's
a tidier place than it used to be--that is, if they will stand her rummagings there, which
I doubt. Look at that Venus, ain't she a beauty? Might have been done by Titian when his paints
ran out, and he had to take to a hot iron to express his art. What, you can't see her well?
Wait a bit and I'll get a lantern. Can't have a naked candle here--things too valuable; no
money could buy them again. My wife and I had another row about naked candles, or it may have
been a paraffin lamp. You sit in that old prayer-stool and look at the work."

Off he went crawling down the dusky stairs and leaving me wondering what Mrs. Potts, of whom
now I heard for the first time, could have been like. An aggravating woman, I felt sure, for
upon whatever points men differ, as to "spring-cleaning" they are all of one mind. No doubt
he was better without her, for what did that dried-up old artist want with a wife?

Dismissing Mrs. Potts from my mind, which, to tell the truth, seemed to have no room for her
shadowy and hypothetical entity, I fell to examining the chest. Oh! it was lovely. In two minutes
the clock was deposed and that chest became the sultana in my seraglio of beauteous things.
The clock had only been the light love of an hour. Here was the eternal queen, that is, unless
there existed a still better chest somewhere else, and I should happen to find it. Meanwhile,
whatever price that old slave-dealer Potts wanted for it, must be paid to him even if I had
to overdraw my somewhat slender account. Seraglios, of whatever sort, it must be remembered,
are expensive luxuries of the rich indeed, though, if of antiques, they can be sold again,
which cannot be said of the human kind for who wants to buy a lot of antique frumps?

There were plenty of things in the chest, such as some odds and ends of tapestry and old clothes
of a Queen Anne character, put here, no doubt, for preservation, as moth does not like this
cypress wood. Also there were some books and a mysterious bundle tied up in a curious shawl
with stripes of colour running through it. That bundle excited me, and I drew the fringes of
the shawl apart and looked in. So far as I could see it contained another dress of rich colours,
also a thick packet of what looked like parchment, badly prepared and much rotted upon one
side as though by damp, which parchment appeared to be covered with faint black-letter writing,
done by some careless scribe with poor ink that had faded very much. There were other things,
too, within the shawl, such as a box made of some red foreign wood, but I had not time to investigate
further for just then I heard old Potts's foot upon the stair, and thought it best to replace
the bundle. He arrived with the lantern and by its light we examined the chest and the poker work.

"Very nice," I said, "very nice, though a good deal knocked about."

"Yes, sir," he replied with sarcasm, "I suppose you'd like to see it neat and new after four
hundred years of wear, and if so, I think I can tell you where you can get one to your liking.
I made the designs for it myself five years ago for a fellow who wanted to learn how to manufacture
antiques. He's in quod now and his antiques are for sale cheap. I helped to put him there to
get him out of the way as a danger to Society."

"What's the price?" I asked with airy detachment.

"Haven't I told you it ain't for sale. Wait till I'm dead and come and buy it at my auction.
No, you won't, though, for it's going somewhere else."

I made no answer but continued my examination while Potts took his seat on the prayer-stool
and seemed to go off into one of his fits of abstraction.

"Well," I said at length when decency told me that I could remain no longer, "if you won't
sell it's no use my looking. No doubt you want to keep it for a richer man, and of course you
are quite right. Will you arrange with the carrier about sending the clock, Mr. Potts, and
I will let you have a cheque. Now I must be off, as I've ten miles to ride and it will be dark
in an hour."

"Stop where you are," said Potts in a hollow voice. "What's a ride in the dark compared with
a matter like this, even if you haven't a lamp and get hauled before your own bench? Stop where
you are, I'm listening to something."

So I stopped and began to fill my pipe.

"Put that pipe away," said Potts, coming out of his reverie, "pipes mean matches; no matches here."

I obeyed, and he went on thinking till at last what between the chest and the worm-eaten Jacobean
bed and old Potts on the prayer-stool, I began to feel as if I were being mesmerized. At length
he rose and said in the same hollow voice:

"Young man, you may have that chest, and the price is £50. Now for heaven's sake don't offer
me £40, or it will be £100 before you leave this room."

"With the contents?" I said casually.

"Yes, with the contents. It's the contents I'm told you are to have."

"Look here, Potts," I said, exasperated, "what the devil do you mean? There's no one in this
room except you and me, so who can have told you anything unless it was old Tom downstairs."

"Tom," he said with unutterable sarcasm, "Tom! Perhaps you mean the mawkin that was put up
to scare birds from the peas in the garden, for it has more in its head than Tom. No one here?
Oh! what fools some men are. Why, the place is thick with them."

"Thick with whom?"

"Who? why, ghosts, of course, as you would call them in your ignorance. Spirits of the dead
I name them. Beautiful enough, too, some of them. Look at that one there," and he lifted the
lantern and pointed to a pile of old bed posts of Chippendale design.

"Good day, Potts," I said hastily.

"Stop where you are," repeated Potts. "You don't believe me yet, but when you are as old as
I am you will remember my words and believe--more than I do and see--clearer than I do, because
it's in your soul, yes, the seed is in your soul, though as yet it is choked by the world,
the flesh, and the devil. Wait till your sins have brought you trouble; wait till the fires
of trouble have burned the flesh away; wait till you have sought Light and found Light and
live in Light, then you will believe; then you will see."

All this he said very solemnly, and standing there in that dusky room surrounded by the wreck
of things that once had been dear to dead men and women, waving the lantern in his hand and
staring--at what was he staring?--really old Potts looked most impressive. His twisted shape
and ugly countenance became spiritual; he was one who had "found Light and lived in Light."

"You won't believe me," he went on, "but I pass on to you what a woman has been telling me.
She's a queer sort of woman; I never saw her like before, a foreigner and dark-hued with strange
rich garments and something on her head. There, that, that," and he pointed through the dirty
window-place to the crescent of a young moon which appeared in the sky. "A fine figure of a
woman," he went on, "and oh! heaven, what eyes--I never saw such eyes before. Big and tender,
something like those of the deer in the park yonder. Proud, too, she is, one who has ruled,
and a lady, though foreign. Well, I never fell in love before, but I feel like it now, and
so would you, young man, if you could see her, and so I think did someone else in his day."

"What did she say to you?" I asked, for by now I was interested enough. Who wouldn't be when
old Potts took to describing beautiful women?

"It's a little difficult to tell you for she spoke in a strange tongue, and I had to translate
it in my head, as it were. But this is the gist of it. That you were to have that chest and
what was in it. There's a writing there, she says, or part of a writing for some has gone--rotted
away. You are to read that writing or to get it read and to print it so that the world may
read it also. She said that 'Hubert' wishes you to do so. I am sure the name was Hubert, though
she also spoke of him with some other title which I do not understand. That's all I can remember,
except something about a city, yes, a City of Gold and a last great battle in which Hubert
fell, covered with glory and conquering. I understood that she wanted to talk about that because
it isn't in the writing, but you interrupted and of course she's gone. Yes, the price is £50
and not a farthing less, but you can pay it when you like for I know you're as honest as most,
and whether you pay it or not, you must have that chest and what's in it and no one else."

"All right," I said, "but don't trust it to the carrier. I'll send a cart for it to-morrow
morning. Lock it now and give me the key."

In due course the chest arrived, and I examined the bundle for the other contents do not matter,
although some of them were interesting. Pinned inside the shawl I found a paper, undated and
unsigned, but which from the character and style of the writing was, I should say, penned by
a lady about sixty years ago. It ran thus:--

"My late father, who was such a great traveller in his young days and so fond of exploring
strange places, brought these things home from one of his journeys before his marriage, I think
from South America. He told me once that the dress was found upon the body of a woman in a
tomb and that she must have been a great lady, for she was surrounded by a number of other
women, perhaps her servants who were brought to be buried with her here when they died. They
were all seated about a stone table at the end of which were the remains of a man. My father
saw the bodies near the ruins of some forest city, in the tomb over which was heaped a great
mound of earth. That of the lady, which had a kind of shroud made of the skins of long-wooled
sheep wrapped about it as though to preserve the dress beneath, had been embalmed in some way,
which the natives of the place, wherever it was, told him showed that she was royal. The others
were mere skeletons, held together by the skin, but the man had a long fair beard and hair
still hanging to his skull, and by his side was a great cross-hilted sword that crumbled to
fragments when it was touched, except the hilt and the knob of amber upon it which had turned
almost black with age. I think my father said that the packet of skins or parchment of which
the underside is badly rotted with damp was set under the feet of the man. He told me that
he gave those who found the tomb a great deal of money for the dress, gold ornaments, and emerald
necklace, as nothing so perfect had been found before, and the cloth is all worked with gold
thread. My father told me, too, that he did not wish the things to be sold."

This was the end of the writing.

Having read it I examined the dress. It was of a sort that I had never seen before, though
experts to whom I have shown it say that it is certainly South American of a very early date,
and like the ornaments, probably pre-Inca Peruvian. It is full of rich colours such as I have
seen in old Indian shawls which give a general effect of crimson. This crimson robe clearly
was worn over a skirt of linen that had a purple border. In the box that I have spoken of were
the ornaments, all of plain dull gold: a waist-band; a circlet of gold for the head from which
rose the crescent of the young moon and a necklace of emeralds, uncut stones now much flawed,
for what reason I do not know, but polished and set rather roughly in red gold. Also there
were two rings. Round one of these a bit of paper was wrapped upon which was written, in another
hand, probably that of the father of the writer of the memorandum:--

"Taken from the first finger of the right hand of a lady's mummy which I am sorry, in our circumstances,
it was quite impossible to carry away."

This ring is a broad band of gold with a flat bezel upon which something was once engraved
that owing to long and hard wear now cannot be distinguished. In short, it appears to be a
signet of old European make but of what age and from what country it is impossible to determine.
The other ring was in a small leathery pouch, elaborately embroidered in gold thread or very
thin wire, which I suppose was part of the lady's costume. It is like a very massive wedding
ring, but six or eight times as thick, and engraved all over with an embossed conventional
design of what look like stars with rays round them, or possibly petalled flowers. Lastly there
was the sword-hilt, of which presently.

Such were the trinkets, if so they may be called. They are of little value intrinsically except
for their weight in gold, because, as I have said, the emeralds are flawed as though they have
been through a fire or some other unknown cause. Moreover, there is about them nothing of the
grace and charm of ancient Egyptian jewellery; evidently they belonged to a ruder age and civilization.
Yet they had, and still have, to my imagining, a certain dignity of their own.

Also--here I became infected with the spirit of the peculiar Potts--without doubt these things
were rich in human associations. Who had worn that dress of crimson with the crosses worked
on it in gold wire (they cannot have been Christian crosses), and the purple-bordered skirt
underneath, and the emerald necklace and the golden circlet from which rose the crescent of
the young moon? Apparently a mummy in a tomb, the mummy of some long-dead lady of a strange
and alien race. Was she such a one as that old lunatic Potts had dreamed he saw standing before
him in the filthy, cumbered upper-chamber of a ruinous house in an England market town, I wondered,
one with great eyes like to those of a doe and a regal bearing?

No, that was nonsense. Potts had lived with shadows until he believed in shadows that came
out of his own imagination and into it returned again. Still, she was a woman of some sort,
and apparently she had a lover or a husband, a man with a great fair beard. How at this date,
which must have been remote, did a golden-bearded man come to foregather with a woman who wore
such robes and ornaments as these? And that sword hilt, worn smooth by handling and with an
amber knob? Whence came it? To my mind--this was before expert examination confirmed my view--it
looked very Norse. I had read the Sagas and I remembered a tale recovered in them of some bold
Norsemen who about the years eight or nine hundred had wandered to the coast of what is known
now to be America--I think a certain Eric was their captain. Could the fair-haired man in the
grave have been one of these?

Thus I speculated before I looked at the pile of parchments so evidently prepared from sheep
skins by one who had only a very rudimentary knowledge of how to work such stuff, not knowing
that in those parchments was hid the answer to many of my questions. To these I turned last
of all, for we all shrink from parchments; their contents are generally so dull. There was
a great bundle of them that had been lashed together with a kind of straw rope, fine straw
that reminded me of that used to make Panama hats. But this had rotted underneath together
with all the bottom part of the parchments, many sheets of them, of which only fragments remained,
covered with dry mould and crumbling. Therefore the rope was easy to remove and beneath it,
holding the sheets in place, was only some stout and comparatively modern string--it had a
red thread in it that marked it as navy cord of an old pattern.

I slipped these fastenings off and lifted a blank piece of skin set upon the top. Beneath appeared
the first sheet of parchment, closely, very closely covered with small "black-letter" writing,
so faint and faded that even if I were able to read black-letter, which I cannot, of it I could
have made nothing at all. The thing was hopeless. Doubtless in that writing lay the key to
the mystery, but it could never be deciphered by me or any one else. The lady with the eyes
like a deer had appeared to old Potts in vain; in vain had she bidden him to hand over this
manuscript to me.

So I thought at the time, not knowing the resources of science. Afterwards, however, I took
that huge bundle to a friend, a learned friend whose business in life it was and is, to deal
with and to decipher old manuscripts.

"Looks pretty hopeless," he said, after staring at these. "Still, let's have a try; one never
knows till one tries."

Then he went to a cupboard in his muniment room and produced a bottle full of some straw-coloured
fluid into which he dipped an ordinary painting brush. This charged brush he rubbed backwards
and forwards over the first lines of the writing and waited. Within a minute, before my astonished
eyes, that faint, indistinguishable script turned coal-black, as black as though it had been
written with the best modern ink yesterday.

"It's all right," he said triumphantly, "it's vegetable ink, and this stuff has the power to
bring it up as it was on the day when it was used. It will stay like that for a fortnight and
then fade away again. Your manuscript is pretty ancient, my friend, time of Richard II, I should
say, but I can read it easily enough. Look, it begins, 'I, Hubert de Hastings, write this in
the land of Tavantinsuyu, far from England where I was born, whither I shall never more return,
being a wanderer as the rune upon the sword of my ancestor, Thorgrimmer, foretold that I should
be, which sword my mother gave me on the day of the burning of Hastings by the French,' and
so on." Here he stopped.

"Then for heaven's sake, do read it," I said.

"My dear friend," he answered, "it looks to me as though it would mean several months' work,
and forgive me for saying that I am paid a salary for my time. Now I'll tell you what you have
to do. All this stuff must be treated, sheet by sheet, and when it turns black it must be photographed
before the writing fades once more. Then a skilled person--so-and-so, or so-and-so, are two
names that occur to me--must be employed to decipher it again, sheet by sheet. It will cost
you money, but I should say that it was worth while. Where the devil is, or was, the land of
Tavantinsuyu?"

"I know," I answered, glad to be able to show myself superior to my learned friend in one humble
instance. "Tavantinsuyu was the native name for the Empire of Peru before the Spanish Invasion.
But how did this Hubert get there in the time of Richard II? That is some centuries earlier
than Pizarro set foot upon its shores."

"Go and find out," he answered. "It will amuse you for quite a long while and perhaps the results
may meet the expenses of decipherment, if they are worth publishing. I expect they are not,
but then, I have read so many old manuscripts and found most of them so jolly dull."

Well, that business was accomplished at a cost that I do not like to record, and here are the
results, more or less modernised, since often Hubert of Hastings expressed himself in a queer
and archaic fashion. Also sometimes he used Indian words as though he had talked the tongue
of these Peruvians, or rather the Chanca variety of it, so long that he had begun to forget
his own language. Myself I have found his story very romantic and interesting, and I hope that
some others will be of the same opinion. Let them judge.

But oh, I do wonder what was the end of it, some of which doubtless was recorded on the rotted
sheets though of course there can have been no account of the great battle in which he fell,
since Quilla could not write at all, least of all in English, though I suppose she survived
it and him.

The only hint of that end is to be found in old Potts's dream or vision, and what is the worth
of dreams and visions? I write it with a pen that I have shaped from a wing feather of the
great eagle of the mountains, with ink that I have made from the juices of certain herbs which
I discovered, and on parchment that I have split from the skins of native sheep, with my own
hands, but badly I fear, though I have seen that art practised when I was a merchant of the
Cheap in London Town.

I will begin at the beginning.

I am the son of a fishing-boat owner and was a trader in the ancient town of Hastings, and
my father was drowned while following his trade at sea. Afterwards, being the only child left
of his, I took on his business, and on a certain day went out to sea to net fish with two of
my serving men. I was then a young man of about three and twenty years of age and not uncomely.
My hair, which I wore long, was fair in colour and curled. My eyes, set wide apart, were and
still are large and blue, although they have darkened somewhat and sunk into the head in this
land of heat and sunshine. My nose was wide-nostrilled and large, my mouth also was over-large,
although my mother and some others used to think it well-shaped. In truth, I was large all
over though not so tall, being burly, with a great breadth of chest and uncommon thickness
through the body, and very strong; so strong that there were few who could throw me when I
was young.

For the rest, like King David, I, who am now so tanned and weather worn that at a little distance
were my hair and beard hidden I might almost be taken for one of the Indian chiefs about me,
was of a ruddy and a pleasant countenance, perhaps because of my wonderful health, who had
never known a day of sickness, and of an easy nature that often goes with health. I will add
this, for why should I not--that I was no fool, but one of those who succeed in that upon which
they set their minds. Had I been a fool I should not to-day be the king of a great people and
the husband of their queen; indeed, I should not be alive.

But enough of myself and my appearance in those years that seem as far off as though they had
never been save in the land of dreams.

Now I and my two serving men, sailors both of them like myself and most of the folk of Hastings
set out upon a summer eve, purposing to fish all night and return at dawn. We came to our chosen
ground and cast out the net, meeting with wonderful fortune since by three in the morning the
big boat was full of every kind of fish. Never before, indeed, had we made so large a haul.

Looking back at that great catch, as here in this far land it is my habit to do upon everything,
however small, that happened to me in my youth before I became a wanderer and an exile, I seem
to see in it an omen. For has it not always been my lot in life to be kissed of fortune and
to gather great store, and then of a sudden to lose it all as I was to lose that rich multitude
of fishes?

To-day, when I write this, once more I have great wealth of pomp and love and power, of gold
also, more than I can count. When I go forth, my armies, who still look on me as half a god,
shout their welcome and kiss the air after their heathen fashion. My beauteous queen bows down
to me and the women of my household abase themselves into the dust. The people of the Ancient
City of Gold turn their faces to the wall and the children cover their eyes with their hands
that they may not look upon my splendour as I pass, while maidens throw flowers for my feet
to tread. Upon my judgment hangs life or death, and my lightest word is as though it were spoken
from heaven. These and many other things are mine, the trappings of power, the prerogative
of the Lord-from-the-Sea who brought victory to the Chanca people and led them back to their
ancient home where they might live safe, far from the Inca's rage.

And yet often, as I sit alone in my splendour upon the roof of the ancient halls or wander
through the starlit palace gardens, I call to mind that great catch of fishes in the English
sea and of what followed after. I call to mind also my prosperity and wealth as one of the
first merchants of London Town and what followed after. I call to mind, too, the winning of
Blanche Aleys, the lady so far above me in rank and station and what followed after. Then it
is that I grow afraid of what may follow after this present hour of peace and love and plenty.

Certainly one thing will follow, and that is death. It may come late or it may come soon. But
yesterday a rumour reached me through my spies that Kari Upanqui, the Inca of Tavantinsuyu,
he who once was as my brother, but who now hates me because of his superstitions, and because
I took a Virgin of the Sun to be my wife, gathers a great host to follow on the path we trod
many years ago when the Chancas fled from the Inca tyranny back to their home in the ancient
City of Gold and to smite us here. That host, said the rumours, cannot march till next year,
and then will be another year upon its journey. Still, knowing Kari, I am sure that it will
march, yes, and arrive, after which must befall the great battle in the mountain passes wherein,
as of old, I shall lead the Chanca armies.

Perchance I am doomed to fall in that battle. Does not the rune upon Wave-Flame, the sword
of Thorgrimmer my ancestor, say of him that holds it that,

     "Conquering, conquered shall he be,
     And far away shall sleep with me"?

Well, if the Chancas conquer, what care I if I am conquered? 'Twould be a good death and a
clean, to fall by Kari's spear, if I knew that Kari and his host fell also, as I swear that
fall they shall, St. Hubert helping me. Then at least Quilla and her children would live on
in peace and greatness since they can have no other foe to fear.

Death, what is death? I say that it is the hope of every one of us and most of all the exile
and the wanderer. At the best it may be glory; at the worst it must be sleep. Moreover, am
I so happy that I should fear to die? Quilla cannot read this writing, and therefore I will
answer, No. I am a Christian, but she and those about her, aye, my own children with them,
worship the moon and the host of heaven. I am white-skinned, they are the hue of copper, though
it is true that my little daughter, Gudruda, whom I named so after my mother, is almost white.
There are secrets in their hearts that I shall never learn and there are secrets in mine from
which they cannot draw the veil because our bloods are different. Yet God knows, I love them
well enough, and most of all that greatest of women, Quilla.

Oh! the truth is that here on earth there is no happiness for man.

It is because of this rumour of the coming of Kari with his host that I set myself to this
task, that I have long had in my mind, to write down something of my history, both in England
and in this land which, at any rate for hundreds of years, mine is the first white foot to
press. It seems a foolish thing to do since when I have written who will read, and what will
chance to that which I have written? I shall leave orders that it be placed beneath my feet
in the tomb, but who will ever find that tomb again? Still I write because something in my
heart urges me to the task.

I return to the far-off days. Our boat being full with merry hearts we set sail before a faint
wind for Hastings beach. As yet there was little light and much fog, still the landward breeze
was enough to draw us forward. Then of a sudden we heard sounds as of men talking upon ships
and the clank of spars and blocks. Presently came a puff of air lifting the fog for a little
and we saw that we were in the midst of a great fleet, a French fleet, for the Lilies of France
flew at their mast-heads, saw, too, that their prows were set for Hastings, though for the
while they were becalmed, since the wind that was enough for our light, large-sailed fishing-boat
could not stir their bulk. Moreover, they saw us, for the men-at-arms on the nearest ship shouted
threats and curses at us and followed the shouts with arrows that almost hit us.

Then the fog closed down again, and in it we slipped through the French fleet.

It may have been the best part of an hour later that we reached Hastings. Before the boat was
made fast to the jetty, I sprang to it shouting:

"Stir! stir! the French are upon you! To arms! We have slipped through a whole fleet of them
in the mist."

Instantly the sleepy quay seemed to awaken. From the neighbouring fish market, from everywhere
sailormen and others came running, followed by children with gaping mouths, while from the
doors of houses far away shot women with scared faces, like ferreted rabbits from their burrows.
In a minute the crowd had surrounded me, all asking questions at once in such a fashion that
I could only answer them with my cry of:

"Stir! the French are upon you. To arms, I say. To arms!"

Presently through the throng advanced an old white-bearded man who wore a badge of office,
crying as he came, "Make way for the bailiff!"

The crowd obeyed, opening a path, and soon we were face to face.

"What is it, Hubert of Hastings?" he asked. "Is there fire that you shout so loudly?"

"Aye, Worship," I answered. "Fire and murder and all the gifts that the French have for England.
The Fleet of France is beating up for Hastings, fifty sail of them or more. We crept through
them in the fog, for the wind which would scarce move them served our turn and beyond an arrow
or two, they took no note of a fishing-boat."

"Whence come they?" asked the bailiff, bewildered.

"I know not, but those in another boat we passed in the midst shouted that these French were
ravaging the coast and heading for Hastings to put it to fire and sword. Then that boat vanished
away, I know not where, and that is all I have to tell save that the French will be here within
an hour."

Without staying to ask more questions, the bailiff turned and ran towards the town, and presently
the alarm bells rang out from the towers of All Saints and St. Clement's, while criers summoned
all men to the market-place. Meanwhile I, not without a sad look at my boat and the rich catch
within, made my way into the town, followed by my two men.

Presently I reached an ancient, timbered house, long, low, and rambling, with a yard by its
side full of barrels, anchors, and other marine stores such as rope, that had to do with the
trade I carried on at this place.

I, Hubert, with a mind full of fears, though not for myself, and a stirring of the blood such
as was natural to my age at the approach of my first taste of battle, ran fast up to that house
which I have described, and paused for a moment by the big elm tree that grew in front of the
door, of which the lower boughs were sawn off because they shut out the light from the windows.
I remember that elm tree very well, first because when I was a child starlings nested in a
hole in the trunk, and I reared one in a wicker cage and made a talking bird of it which I
kept for several years. It was so tame that it used to go about sitting on my shoulder, till
at last, outside the town a cat frightened it thence, and before I could recapture it, it was
taken by a hawk, which hawk I shot afterwards with an arrow out of revenge.

Also this elm is impressed upon me by the fact that on that morning when I halted by it, I
noted how green and full of leaf it was. Next morning, after the fire, I saw it again, all
charred and blackened, with its beautiful foliage withered by the heat. This contrast remained
upon my memory, and whenever I see any great change of fortune from prosperity to ruin, or
from life to death, always I bethink me of that elm. For it is by little things which we ourselves
have seen and not by those written of or told by others, that we measure and compare events.

The reason that I ran so hard and then paused by the elm, was because my widowed mother lived
in that house. Knowing that the French meant mischief for a good reason, because one of their
arrows, or perhaps a quarrel from a cross-bow, whistled just past my head out there upon the
sea, my first thought was to get her away to some place of safety, no easy task seeing that
she was infirm with age. My second, that which caused me to pause by the tree, was how I should
break the news to her in such a fashion that she would not be over-frightened. Having thought
this over I went on into the house.

The door opened into the sitting-room that had a low roof of plaster and big oak beams. There
I found my mother kneeling by the table upon which food was set for breakfast: fried herrings,
cold meat, and a jug of ale. She was saying her prayers after her custom, being very religious
though in a new fashion, since she was a follower of a preacher called Wycliffe, who troubled
the Church in those days. She seemed to have gone to sleep at her prayers, and I watched her
for a moment, hesitating to waken her. My mother, as even then I noted, was a very handsome
woman, though old, for I was born when she had been married twenty years or more, with white
hair and well-cut features that showed the good blood of which she came, for she was better
bred than my father and quarrelled with her kin to marry him.

At the sound of my footsteps she woke up and saw me.

"Strange," she said, "I slept at my prayers who did so little last night, as has become a habit
with me when you are out a-fishing, for which God forgive me, and dreamed that there was some
trouble forward. Scold me not, Hubert, for when the sea has taken the father and two sons,
it is scarcely wonderful that I should be fearful for the last of my blood. Help me to rise,
Hubert, for this water seems to gather in my limbs and makes them heavy. One day, the leech
says, it will get to the heart and then all will be over."

I obeyed, first kissing her on the brow, and when she was seated in her armed chair by the
table, I said,

"You dream too well, Mother. There is trouble. Hark! St. Clement's bells are talking of it.
The French come to visit Hastings. I know for I sailed through their fleet just after dawn."

"Is it so?" she asked quietly. "I feared worse. I feared lest the dream meant that you had
gone to join your brothers in the deep. Well, the French are not here yet, as thank God you
are. So eat and drink, for we of England fight best on full bellies."

Again I obeyed who was very hungry after that long night and needed food and ale, and as I
swallowed them we heard the sound of folk shouting and running.

"You are in haste, Hubert, to join the others on the quay and send a Frenchman or two to hell
with that big bow of yours?" she said inquiringly.

"Nay," I answered, "I am in haste to get you out of this town, which I fear may be burnt. There
is a certain cave up yonder by the Minnes Rock where I think you might lie safe, Mother."

"It has come down to me from my fathers, Hubert, that it was never the fashion of the women
of the north to keep their men to shield them when duty called them otherwhere. I am helpless
in my limbs and heavy, and cannot climb, or be borne up yonder hill to any cave. Here I stop
where I have dwelt these five-and-forty years, to live or die as God pleases. Get you to your
duty, man. Stay. Call those wenches and bid them fly inland to their folk, out Burwash way.
They are young and fleet of foot, and no Frenchman will catch them."

I summoned the girls who were staring, white-faced, from the attic window-place. In three minutes
they were gone, though it is true that one of them, the braver, wished to bide with her mistress.

I watched them start up the street with other fugitives who were pouring out of Hastings, and
came back to my mother. As I did so a great shout told me that the French fleet had been sighted.

"Hubert," she said, "take this key and go to the oak chest in my sleeping room, lift out the
linen at the top and bring me that which lies wrapped in cloth beneath."

I did so, returning with a bundle that was long and thin. With a knife she cut the string that
tied it. Within were a bag of money and a sword in an ancient scabbard covered with a rough
skin which I took to be that of a shark, which scabbard in parts was inlaid with gold.

"Draw it," said my mother.

I did so, and there came to light a two-edged blade of blue steel, such as I had never seen
before, for on the blade were engraved strange characters whereof I could make nothing, although
as it chanced I could read and write, having been taught by the monks in my childhood. The
hilt, also, that was in the form of a cross, had gold inlaid upon it; at the top of it, a large
knob or apple of amber, much worn by handling. For the rest it was a beauteous weapon and well
balanced.

"What of this sword?" I asked.

"This, Son. With the black bow that you have," and she pointed to the case that leaned against
the table, "it has come down in my family for many generations. My father told me that it was
the sword of one Thorgrimmer, his ancestor, a Norseman, a Viking he called him, who came with
those who took England before the Norman time; which I can well believe since my father's name,
like mine, till I married, was Grimmer. This sword, also, has a name and it is Wave-Flame.
With it, the tale tells, Thorgrimmer did great deeds, slaying many after their heathen fashion
in his battles by land and sea. For he was a wanderer, and it is said of him that once he sailed
to a new land far across the ocean, and won home again after many strange adventures, to die
at last here in England in some fray. That is all I know, save that a learned man from the
north once told my father's father that the writing on the sword means:--

     "He who lifts Wave-Flame on high
     In love shall live and in battle die;
     Storm-tossed o'er wide seas shall roam
     And in strange lands shall make his home.
     Conquering, conquered shall he be,
     And far away shall sleep with me.

"Those were the words which I remember because of the jingle of them; also because such seems
to have been the fate of Thorgrimmer and the sword that his grandson took from his tomb."

Here I would have asked about this grandson and the tomb, but having no time, held my peace.

"All my life have I kept that sword," went on my mother, "not giving it to your father or brothers,
lest the fate written on it should befall them, for those old wizards of the north, who fashioned
such weapons with toil and skill, could foresee the future--as at times I can, for it is in
my blood. Yet now I am moved to bid you take it, Hubert, and go where its flame leads you and
dree your gloom, whatever it may be, for I know you will use it like Thorgrimmer's self."

She paused for a moment, then went on:

"Hubert, perhaps we part for the last time, for I think that my hour is at hand. But let not
that trouble you, since I am glad to go to join those who went before, and others with them,
perchance Thorgrimmer's self. Hearken, Hubert. If aught befalls me, or this place, stay not
here. Go to London town and seek out John Grimmer, my brother, the rich merchant and goldsmith
who dwells in the place called Cheap. He knew you as a child and loved you, and lacking offspring
of his own will welcome you for both our sakes. My father would not give John the sword lest
its fate should be on him, but I say that John will be glad to welcome one of our race who
holds it in his hand. Take it then, and with it that bag of gold, which may prove of service
ere all be done.

"Aye, and there is one more thing--this ring which, so says the tale, came down with the sword
and the bow, and once had writing on it like the sword, though that is long since rubbed away.
Take it and wear it till perchance, in some day to come, you give it to another as I did."

Wondering at all this tale which, after her secret fashion, my mother had kept from me till
that hour, I set the ring upon my finger.

"I gave yonder ring to your father on the day that we were betrothed," went on my mother, "and
I took it back again from his corpse after he had been found floating in the sea. Now I pass
it on to you who soon will be all that is left of both of us."

"Hark!" she continued, "the crier summons all men with their arms to the market-place to fight
England's foes. Therefore one word more while I buckle the sword Wave-Flame on to you, as doubtless
his women folk did on to Thorgrimmer, your ancestor. My blessing on you, Hubert. Be you such
a one as Thorgrimmer was, for we of the Norse blood desire that our loves and sons should prove
not backward when swords are aloft and arrows fly. But be you more than he, be you a Christian
also, remembering that however long you live, and the Battle-maidens have not marked you yet,
at last you must die and give account.

"Hubert, you are such a one as women will love; one, too, who, I fear me, will be a lover of
women, for that weakness goes with strength and manhood by Nature's laws. Be careful of women,
Hubert, and if you may, choose those who are not false and cling to her who is most true. Oh,
you will wander far; I read it in your eyes that you will wander far, yet shall your heart
stay English. Kiss me and begone! Lad, are you forgetting your spare arrows and the bull-hide
jerkin that was your father's? You will want them both to-day. Farewell, farewell! God and
His Christ be with you--and shoot you straight and smite you hard. Nay, no tears, lest my eyes
should be dimmed, for I'll climb to the attic and watch you fight."

CHAPTER II

THE LADY BLANCHE

So I went, with a sore heart, for I remembered that when my father and brothers were drowned,
although I was then but a little one, my mother had foreseen it, and I feared much lest it
might be thus in her own case also. I loved my mother. She was a stern woman, it was true,
with little softness about her, which I think came with her blood, but she had a high heart,
and oh! her last words were noble. Yet through it all I was pleased, as any young man would
have been, with the gift of the wonderful sword which once had been that of Thorgrimmer, the
sea-rover, whose blood ran in my body against which it lay, and I hoped that this day I might
have chance to use it worthily as Thorgrimmer did in forgotten battles. Having imagination,
I wondered also whether the sword knew that after its long sleep it had come forth again to
drink the blood of foes.

Also I was pleased with another thing, namely, that my mother had told me that I should live
my life and not die that day by the hand of Frenchmen; and that in my life I should find love,
of which to tell truth already I knew a little of a humble sort, for I was a comely youth,
and women did not run away from me, or if they did, soon they stopped. I wanted to live my
life, I wanted to see great adventures and to win great love. The only part of the business
which was not to my taste was that command of my mother's, that I should go to London to sit
in a goldsmith's shop. Still, I had heard that there was much to be seen in London, and at
least it would be different from Hastings.

The street outside our doors was crowded with folk, some of the men making their way to the
market-place, about whom hung women and children weeping; others, old people, wives and girls
and little ones fleeing from the town. I found the two sailormen who had been with me on the
boat, waiting for me. They were brawny fellows named Jack Grieves and William Bull, who had
been in our service since my childhood, good fishermen and fighters both; indeed one of them,
William Bull, had served in the French wars.

"We knew that you were coming, Master, so we bided here for you," said William, who having
once been an archer was armed with a bow and a short sword, whereas Jack had only an axe, also
a knife such as we used on the smacks for cleaning fish.

I nodded, and we went on to the market-place and joined the throng of men, a vast number of
them, who were gathered there to defend Hastings and their homes. Nor were we too soon, for
the French ships were already beaching within a few yards of the shore or on it, their draught
being but small, while the sailors and men-at-arms were pushing off in small boats or wading
to the strand.

There was great confusion in the market-place, for as is common in England, no preparation
had been made against attack though such was always to be feared.

The bailiff ran about shouting orders, as did others, but proper officers were lacking, so
that in the end men acted as the fancy took them. Some went down towards the beach and shot
with arrows at the Frenchmen. Others took refuge in houses, others stood irresolute, waiting,
knowing not which way to turn. I and my two men were with those who went on to the beach where
I loosed some arrows from my big black bow, and saw a man fall before one of them.

But we could do little or nothing, for these Frenchmen were trained soldiers under proper command.
They formed themselves into companies and advanced, and we were driven back. I stopped as long
as I dared, and drawing the sword, Wave-Flame, fought with a Frenchman who was in advance of
the others. What is more, making a great blow at his head which I missed, I struck him on the
arm and cut it off, for I saw it fall to the ground. Then others rushed up at me and I fled
to save my life.

Somehow I found myself being pressed up the steep Castle Hill with a number of Hastings folk,
followed by the French. We reached the Castle and got into it, but the old portcullis would
not close, and in sundry places the walls were broken down. Here we found a number of women
who had climbed for refuge, thinking that the place would be safe. Among these was a beautiful
and high-born maiden whom I knew by sight. Her father was Sir Robert Aleys who, I believe,
was then the Warden of the Castle of Pevensey, and she was named the lady Blanche. Once, indeed,
I had spoken with her on an occasion too long to tell. Then her large blue eyes, which she
knew well how to use, had left me with a swimming head, for she was very fair and very sweet
and gracious, with a most soft voice, and quite unlike any other woman I had ever seen, nor
did she seem at all proud. Soon her father, an old knight, who had no name for gentleness in
the countryside, but was said to be a great lover of gold, had come up and swept her away,
asking her what she did, talking with a common fishing churl. This had happened some months before.

Well, there I found her in the Castle, alone it seemed, and knowing me again, which I thought
strange, she ran to me, praying me to protect her. More, she began to tell me some long tale,
to which I had not time to listen, of how she had come to Hastings with her father, Sir Robert,
and a young lord named Deleroy, who, I understood, was some kinsman of hers, and slept there.
How, too, she had been separated from them in the throng when they were attempting to return
to Pevensey which her father must go to guard, because her horse was frightened and ran away,
and of how finally men took her by the arm and brought her to this castle, saying that it was
the safest place.

"Then here you must bide, Lady Blanche," I answered, cutting her short. "Cling to me and I
will save you if I can, even if it costs me my life."

Certainly she did cling to me for all the rest of that terrible day, as will be seen.

From this height we saw Hastings beginning to burn, for the Frenchmen had fired the town in
sundry places, and being built of wood, it burnt furiously. Also we saw and heard horrible
scenes and sounds of rapine, such as chance in this Christian world of ours where a savage
foe finds peaceful folk of another race at his mercy. In the houses people were burnt; in the
streets they were being murdered, or worse. Yes, even children were murdered, for afterwards
I saw the bodies of some of them.

Awhile later through the wreaths of smoke we perceived companies of the French advancing to
attack the Castle. There may have been three hundred of them in all, and we did not count more
than fifty men, some of us ill-armed, together with a mob of aged people and many women and
children. What had become of the other men I do not know, but orders had been shouted from
all quarters, and some had gone this way and some that. Some, too, I think, had fled, lacking
leaders.

The French having climbed the hill, began to attack our ill-fenced gateways, bringing up beams
of timber to force them in. Those of us who had bows shot some of them, though, their armour
being good, for the most part the arrows glanced. But few had bows. Moreover, whenever we showed
ourselves they poured such a rain of quarrels and other shafts upon us that we could not face
it, lacking mail as we did, and a number of us were killed or wounded. At last they forced
the easternmost gate which was the weakest, and got in there and over a place in the wall were
it was broken. We fought them as well as we could; myself I cut down two with the sword, Wave-Flame,
hewing right through the helm of one, for the steel of that sword was good. Here, too, Jack
Grieves was killed by my side by a pike thrust, and died calling to me to fight on for old
England and Hastings town; after which he said something about beer and breathed his last.

The end of it was that those who were left were driven out of the Castle together with the
women and children, the murdering French killing every man who fell wounded where he lay, and
trying to make prisoner any women they thought young and fair enough. Especially did they seek
to capture the lady Blanche because they saw that she was beautiful and of high station. But
by good fortune more than aught else, I saved her from this fate.

As it chanced we were among the last to leave the Castle, whence, to tell the truth, I was
loath to go, for by now my blood was up, and with a few others fought till I was driven out.
I prayed the lady Blanche to run forward with the other women. But she would not, answering
that she trusted no one else, but would stay to die with me, as though that would help either
of us.

Thus it came about that a tall French knight who had set his eyes on her, outclimbed his fellows
upon the slope of the hill, for they were weary and gathering to re-form, and catching her
round the middle, strove to drag her away. I fell on him and we fought. He had fine armour
and a shield while I had none, but I held the long sword while he only wielded a battle-axe.
I knew that if he could get in a blow with that battle-axe, I was sped, since the bull's hide
of my jerkin would never stand against it. Therefore it was my business to keep out of his
reach. This, being young and active, for the most part I made shift to do, especially as he
could not move very quickly in his mail. The end of it was that I cut him on the arm through
a joint in his harness, whereon he rushed at me, swearing French oaths.

I leapt on one side and as he passed, smote with all my strength. The blow fell between neck
and shoulder, from behind as it were, and such was the temper of that sword named Wave-Flame
that it shore through his mail deep into the flesh beneath, to the backbone as I believe. At
least he went down in a heap--I remember the rattle of his armour as he fell, and there lay
still. Then we fled on down the steep path, I holding the bloody sword with one hand and Lady
Blanche with the other, while she thanked me with her eyes.

At length we were in the town again, running up my own street. On either side of us the houses
burned, and behind us came another body of the French. The reek got into our eyes and we stumbled
over dead or fainting people.

Looking to the left I caught sight of the elm tree of which I have spoken, that grew in front
of our door, and saw that the house behind it was burning. Yes, and I saw more, for at the
attic window, which was open, the flames making an arch round her, sat my mother. Moreover,
she was singing for I heard her voice and the wild words she sang, though this was a strange
thing for a woman to do in the hour of such a death. Further, she saw and knew me, for she
waved her hands to me, then pointed towards the sea, why, I did not guess at the time. I stopped,
purposing to try to rescue her though the front of the house was flaming, and the attempt must
have ended in my death. But at that moment the roof fell in, causing the fire to spout upwards
and outwards. This was the last that I saw of my mother, though afterwards we found her body
and gave it burial with those of many other victims.

There was no time to stay, for the conquering French were pouring up the street behind us,
shooting as they came and murdering any laggards whom they could catch. On we went up the steep
slope of the Minnes Rock. I would have fled on into the open country, but the lady Blanche
had no strength left. Twice she sank to the ground, stricken with terror and weariness, and
each time prayed me not to leave her; nor indeed did I wish to do so. The end of it was that
William Bull and I between us half carried her with much toil to the cave of which I had spoken
to my mother. The task was heavy and slow, since always we must scramble over sheer ground.
What is more, a party of the French, seeing our plight, followed us. Perhaps some of them guessed
who the lady was, for there were many spies in Hastings who might have told them, and desired
to capture and hold her to ransom.

At the least they came on after us and a few others, women all of them, who had joined our
company, being unable to travel further, or trusting to William Bull and myself to protect them.

We reached the cave, and thrusting the women along it, William and I stood in the mouth and
waited. He had no bow and all my arrows were gone save three, but of these I, who was noted
for my archery, determined to make the best use I could. So I drew them out, and having strung
the bow, sat down to get my breath. On came the French, shouting and jabbering at us to the
effect that they would cut our throats and carry off la belle dame to be their sport.

"She shall be mine!" yelled a big fellow with a flattened nose and a wide mouth who was ahead
of the others, and not more than fifty yards away.

I rose, and praying my patron, good St. Hubert after whom I was named because I first saw light
upon his day, the 23rd of November, to give me skill, I drew the great bow to my ear, aimed,
and loosed. Nor did St. Hubert, a lover of fine shooting, fail me in my need, for that arrow
rushed out and found its home in the big mouth of the Frenchman, through which it passed, pinning
his foul tongue to his neck bone.

Down he went, and cheered by the sight I refitted and loosed at the next. Him, too, the arrow
caught, so that he fell almost on the other.

I set the third and last arrow on the string and waited a space. Behind these two was a squat,
broad man, a knight I suppose, for he wore armour, and had a shield with a cock painted on
it. This man, frightened by the fate of his companions, yet not minded to give up the venture
for those in rear of him urged him on, bent himself almost double, and holding the shield over
his helm which was closed, so as to protect his head and body, came on at a good pace.

I waited till he was within five-and-twenty yards or so, hoping that the roughness of the ground
would cause him to stumble and the shield to shift so that I could get a chance at him behind
it. But I did not, so at last, again praying to St. Hubert, I drew the big bow till the string
touched my ear, and let drive. The shaft, pointed with tempered steel, struck the shield full
in the centre, and by Heaven, pierced it, aye, and the mail behind, aye, and the flesh it covered,
so that he, too, got his death.

"A great shot, Master," said William, "that no other bow in Hastings could have sped."

"Not so ill," I answered, "but it is my last. Now we must fight as we can with sword and axe
until we be sped."

William nodded, and the women in the cave began to wail while I unstrung my bow and set it
in its case, from habit I think, seeing that I never hoped to look upon it again.

Just then from the French ships in the harbour there came a great blaring of trumpets giving
some alarm, and the Frenchmen of a sudden, ceasing from their attack, turned and ran towards
the shore. I stepped out of the cave with William and looked. There on the sea, drawing near
from the east before a good wind, I saw ships, and saw, too, that from their masts flew the
pennons of England, for the golden leopards gleamed in the sun.

"It is our fleet, William," I said, "come to talk with these French."

"Then I would that it had come sooner," answered William. "Still, better now than not at all."

Thus were we saved, through Hamo de Offyngton, the Abbot of Battle Abbey, or so I was told
afterwards, who collected a force by land and sea and drove off the French after they had ravaged
the Isle of Wight, attacked Winchelsea, and burned the greater part of Hastings. So it came
about that in the end these pirates took little benefit by their wickedness, since they lost
sundry ships with all on board, and others left in such haste that their people remained on
shore where they were slain by the mob that gathered as soon as it was seen that they were
deserted, helped by a company of the Abbot's men who had marched from Battle. But with all
this I had nothing to do who now that the fight was over, felt weak as a child and could think
of little save that I had seen my mother burning.

Presently, however, that happened which woke me from my grief and caused my blood which had
grown sluggish to run again. For when she knew that she was safe the lady Blanche came out
of the cave and addressed me as I stood there leaning against the rock with the red sword Wave-Flame
in my hand, as I had drawn it to make ready for the last fight to the death. All sorts of sweet
names she called me--a hero, her deliverer, and I know not what besides.

In the end, as I made no answer, being dazed, also hurt by an axe blow on the breast which
I had not felt before, dealt by that Frenchman whom I slew near the Castle, she did more. Throwing
her arms about me she kissed me thrice, on either cheek and on the lips, doubtless because
she was overwrought, and in her thankfulness forgot her maidenly reserve, though as William
Bull said afterwards, this forgetfulness did not cause her to kiss him who had also helped
her up the hill.

Those kisses were like wine to me, for it is strange how, if we love her, by the decree of
Nature the touch of a beautiful woman's lips, felt for the first time, affects us in our youth.
Whatever else we forget, that we always remember, however false those lips afterwards be proved.
For then the wax is soft and the die sinks deep, so deep that no after-heats can melt its stamp
and no fretting wear it out while we live beneath the sun.

Now my young blood being awakened, I was minded to return those kisses, and began to do so
with a Jew's interest, when I heard a rough voice swearing many strange oaths, and heard also
the other women who had sheltered with us in the cave begin to titter, for the moment forgetting
all their private woes, as those of their sex will do when there is kissing in the wind.

"God's blood!" said the rough voice, "who is this that handles my daughter as though they had
been but an hour wed? Take those lips of yours from her, fellow, or I'll cut them from your chops."

I looked round astonished, to see Sir Robert Aleys mounted on a grey horse, and followed by
a company of men-at-arms who appeared to be under the command of a well-favoured, dark-eyed
young captain with long hair, and dressed more wondrously than any man I had ever seen before.
Had he put on Joseph's coat over his mail, he could not have worn more colours, and I noted
that the toes of his shoes curled up so high that I wondered however he worked them through
his stirrups, and what would happen to him if by chance he were unhorsed.

Being taken aback I made no answer, but William Bull, who, if a rough fellow, had a tongue
in his head and a ready wit, spoke up for me.

"If you want to know," he said in his Sussex drawl, "I'll tell you who he is, Sir Robert Aleys.
He is my worshipful master, Hubert of Hastings, ship-owner, householder, and trader of this
town. Or at least he was these things, but now it seems that his ships and house are burnt
and his mother with them; also that there will be no trade in Hastings for many a day."

"Mayhap," answered Sir Robert, adding other oaths, "but why does he buss my daughter?"

"Perchance because he must give as good as he got, which is a law among honest merchants, noble
Sir Robert. Or perchance because he has a better right to buss her than any man alive, seeing
that but for him, by now she would be but stinking clay, or a Frenchman's leman."

Here the fine young captain cut in, saying,

"Whatever else this worshipful trader may need, he does not lack a trumpeter."

"That is so, my Lord Deleroy," replied William, unmoved, "for when I find a good song I like
to sing it. Go now and look at those three men who lie yonder on the slope, and see whether
the arrows in them bear my master's mark. Go also and look upon the Castle hill and find a
knight with his head well-nigh hewn from his shoulders, and see whether yonder sword fits into
the cut. Aye, and at others that I could tell you of, slain, every one of them, to save this
fair lady. Aye, go you whose garments are so fine and unstained, and then come back and talk
of trumpeters."

"Pish!" said my Lord Deleroy with a shrug of his shoulders, "a lady who is over-wrought and
hangs to some common fellow, like one who kisses the feet of a wooden saint that she thinks
has saved her from calamity!"

At these words I, who had been listening like a man in a dream, awoke, as it were, for they
stung me. Moreover, I had heard that this fine Deleroy was one of those who owed his place
and rank to the King's favour, as he did his high name, being, it was reported, by birth but
a prince's bastard sprung from some relative of Sir Robert whom therefore he called cousin.

"Sir," I said, "you know best whether I am more common than you are. Let that be. At least
I hold in my hand the sword of one who begat my forefather hundreds of years ago, a certain
Thorgrimmer who was great in his time. Now I have had my fill of fighting to-day, and you,
doubtless through no fault of your own, have had none; you also are clad in mail and I, a common
fellow, have none. Deign then to descend from that horse and take a turn with me though I be
tired, and thus prove my commonness upon my body. Of your nobility do this, seeing that after
all we are of one flesh."

Now, stung in his turn, he made as though he would do what I prayed, when for the first time,
after glancing at her father who sat still--puzzled, it would seem--the lady Blanche spoke.

"Be not mad, Cousin," she said. "I tell you that this gentleman has saved my life and honour,
twice at least to-day. Is it wonderful, then, if I thanked him in the best fashion that a woman
can, and thus brought your insults on him?"

He hesitated, though one of his curled-up shoes was out of the stirrup, when suddenly Sir Robert
broke in in his big voice, saying:

"God's truth, Cousin, I think that you will do well to leave this young cock alone, since I
like not the look of that red spur of his," and he glanced at the sword Wave-Flame. "Though
he be weary, he may have a kick or two in him yet."

Then he turned to me and added:

"Sir, you have fought well; many a man has earned knighthood for less, and if a fair maid thanked
you in her own fashion, you are not to blame. I, her father, also thank you and wish you all
good fortune till we meet again. Farewell. Daughter, make shift to share this horse with me,
and let us away out of this stricken town to Pevensey, where perchance it will please those
French to call to-morrow."

A minute later they were gone, and I noted with a pang that as they went the lady Blanche,
having waved her good-bye to me, talked fast to her cousin Deleroy and that he held her hand
to steady her upon her father's horse.

CHAPTER III

HUBERT COMES TO LONDON

When the lady Blanche was out of sight, followed by the women who had sheltered with us in
the cave, William and I went to a stream we knew of not far away and drank our fill. Then we
walked to the three whom I had shot with my big bow, hoping to regain the arrows, for I had
none left. This, however, could not be done though all the men were dead, for one of the shafts,
the last, was broken, and the other two were so fixed in flesh and bone that only a surgeon's
saw would loose them.

So we left them where they were, and before the men were buried many came to marvel at the
sight, thinking it a wonderful thing that I should have killed these three with three arrows,
and that any bow which arm might bend could have driven the last of them through an iron shield
and a breastplate behind it.

This armour, I should tell, William took for himself, since it was of his size. Also on the
morrow, returning to the Castle Hill, I stripped the knight whom I had slain with the sword,
Wave-Flame, of his splendid Milan mail, whereof the plastron, or breast-plate, was inlaid with
gold, having over it a camail of chain to cover the joints, through which my good sword had
shorn into his neck. The cognizance on his shield strangely enough was three barbed arrows,
but what was the name of the knight who bore it I never learned. This mail, which must have
cost a great sum, the Bailiff of Hastings granted me to keep, since I had slain its wearer
and borne myself well in the fight. Moreover, I took the three arrows for my own cognizance,
though in truth I had no right to any, being in those days but a trader. (Little did I know
then how well this mail was to serve me in the after years.)

By now night was coming on, and as we could see from the cave mouth that the part of Hastings
which lies towards the village of St. Leonards seemed to have escaped the fire, thitherward
we went by the beach to avoid the heat and falling timbers in the burning town. On our way
we met others and from them heard all that had befallen. It would seem that the French loss
in life was heavier than our own, since many of them were cut off when they tried to fly to
their ships, and some of these could not be floated from the beach or were rammed and sunk
with all aboard by the English vessels. But the damage done to Hastings was as much as could
scarcely be made good in a generation, for the most of it was burnt or burning. Also many,
like my own mother, had perished in the fire, being sick or aged or in childbed, or for this
reason and that forgotten and unable to move. Indeed on the beach were hundreds of folk in
despair, nor was it only the women and children who wept that evening.

For my part, with William I went beyond the burning to the house of a certain old priest who
was my confessor, and the friend of my father before me, and there we found food and slept,
he returning thanks to God for my escape and offering me consolation for the loss of my mother
and goods.

I rested but ill that night, as those do who are over-weary. Moreover, this had been my first
taste of battle, and again and again I saw those men falling before my sword and arrows. Very
proud was I to have slain them, wicked ravishers as they were, and very glad that from my boyhood
I had practised myself with sword and bow till I could fence with any, and was perhaps the
most skilled marksman in Hastings, having won the silver arrow at the butts at the last meeting,
and from archers of all ages. Yet the sight of their deaths haunted me who remembered how well
their fate might have been my own, had they got in the first shot or blow.

Where had they gone to, I wondered? To the priest's Heaven or Hell? Were they now telling their
sins to some hard-faced angel while he checked the count from his book, reminding them of many
that they had forgotten? Or were they fast asleep for ever and ever as a shrewd thinker whom
I knew had told me secretly he was sure would be the fate of all of us, whatever the priests
might teach and believe. And where was my mother whom I had loved and who loved me well, although
outwardly she was so stern a woman, my mother whom I had seen burned alive, singing as she
burned? Oh! it was a vile world, and it seemed strange that God should cause men and women
to be born that they might come to such cruel ends. Yet who were we to question His decrees
of which we knew neither the beginning nor the finish?

Anyway, I was glad I was not dead, for now that all was over I trembled and felt afraid, which
I had never done during the fighting, even when my hour seemed very near.

Lastly there was this high-born lady, Blanche Aleys, with whom fortune had thrown me so strangely
that day. Those blue eyes of hers had pierced my heart like darts, and do what I would I might
not rid my mind of the thought of her, or my ears of the sound of her soft voice, while her
kisses seemed still to burn upon my lips. It wrung me to think that perhaps I should never
see her again, or that if I did I might not speak with her, being so far beneath her in condition,
and having already earned the wrath of her father, and, as I guessed, the jealousy of that
scented cousin of hers whom they said the King loved like a brother.

What had my mother told me? To leave this place and go to London, there to find my uncle, John
Grimmer, goldsmith and merchant, who was my godfather, and to ask him to take me into his business.
I remembered this uncle of mine, for some seven or eight years before, when I was a growing
lad, because there was a plague in London he had come down to Hastings to visit us. He only
stayed a week, however, because he said that the sea air tied up his stomach and that he would
rather risk the plague with a good stomach than leave it behind him with a bad one--though
I think it was his business he thought of, not his stomach.

He was a strange old man, not unlike my mother, but with a nose more hooked, small dark eyes,
and a bald head on which he set a cap of velvet. Even in the heat of summer he was always cold
and wore a frayed fur robe, complaining much if he came into a draught of air. Indeed he looked
like a Jew, though a good Christian enough, and laughed about it, because he said that this
appearance of his served him well in his trade, since Jews were always feared, and it was held
to be impossible to overreach them.

For the rest I only recalled that he examined me as to my book learning which did not satisfy
him, and went about valuing all our goods and fishing-boats, showing my mother how we were
being cheated and might earn more than we did. When he departed he gave me a gold piece and
said that Life was nothing but vanity, and that I must pray for his soul when he was dead as
he was sure it would need such help, also that I ought to put the gold piece out to interest.
This I did by buying with it a certain fierce mastiff dog I coveted that had been brought on
a ship from Norway, which dog bit some great man in our town, who hauled my mother before the
bailiff about it and caused the poor beast to be killed, to my great wrath.

Now that I came to think of it, I had liked my Uncle John well enough although he was so different
from others. Why should I not go to him? Because I did not wish to sit in a shop in London,
I who loved the sea and the open air; also because I feared he might ask me what I had done
with that gold piece and make a mock of me about the dog. Yet my mother had bidden me go, and
it was her last command to me, her dying words which it would be unlucky to disobey. Moreover,
our boats and house were burnt and I must work hard and long before these could be replaced.
Lastly, in London I should see no more of the lady Blanche Aleys, and there could learn to
forget the lights in her blue eyes. So I determined that I would go, and at last fell asleep.

Next morning I made my confession to the old priest that, amongst other matters, he might shrive
me of the blood which I had shed, though this he said needed no forgiveness from God or man,
being, as I think, a stout Englishman at heart. Also I took counsel with him as to what I should
do, and he told me it was my duty to obey my mother's wishes, since such last words were often
inspired from on high and declared the will of Heaven. Further he pointed out that I should
do well to avoid the lady Blanche Aleys who was one far above me in degree, the following of
whom might bring me to trouble, or even to death; moreover, that I might mend my broken fortunes
through the help of my uncle, a very rich man as he had heard, to whom he would write a letter
about me.

Thus this matter was settled.

Still some days went by before I left Hastings, since first I must wait until the ashes of
our house were cool enough to search in them for my mother's body. Those who found her at length
said that she was not so much burned as might have been expected, but as to this I am uncertain,
since I could not bring myself to look upon her who desired to remember her as she had been
in life. She was buried by the side of my father, who was drowned, in the churchyard of St.
Clement's, and when all had gone away I wept a little on her grave.

The rest of that day I spent making ready for my journey. As it chanced when the house was
burnt the outbuildings which lay on the farther side of the yard behind escaped the fire, and
in the stable were two good horses, one a grey riding-gelding and the other a mare that used
to drag the nets to the quay and bring back the fish, which horses, although frightened and
alarmed, were unharmed. Also there was a quantity of stores, nets, salt, dried fish in barrels,
and I know not what besides. The horses I kept, but all the rest of the gear, together with
the premises, the ground on which the house had stood, and the other property I made over to
William, my man, who promised me to pay me their value when he could earn it in better times.

Next morning I rode away for London upon the grey horse, loading the armour of the knight I
had killed and such other possessions as remained to me upon the mare which I led with a rope.
Save William there was none to say me good-bye, for the misery in Hastings was so great that
all were concerned with their own affairs or in mourning their dead. I was not sorry that it
fell out thus, since I was so full of sadness at leaving the place where I was born and had
lived all my life, that I think I should have shed tears if any who had been my friends had
spoken kind words to me, which would have been unmanly. Never had I felt so lonely as when
from the high ground I gazed back to the ruins of Hastings over which still hung a thin pall
of smoke. My courage seemed to fail me altogether; I looked forward to the future with fear,
believing that I had been born unlucky, that it held no good for me who probably should end
my days as a common soldier or a fisherman, or mayhap in prison or on the gallows. From childhood
I had suffered these fits of gloom, but as yet this was the blackest of them that I had known.

At length, the sun that had been hidden shone out and with its coming my temper changed. I
remembered that I who might so easily have been dead, was sound, young, and healthy, that I
had sword, bow, and armour of the best, also twenty or more of gold pieces, for I had not counted
them, in the bag which my mother gave me with Wave-Flame. Further, I hoped that my uncle would
befriend me, and if he did not, there were plenty of captains engaged in the wars who might
be glad of a squire, one who could shoot against any man and handle a sword as well as most.

So putting up a prayer to St. Hubert after my simple fashion, I pushed on blithely to the crest
of a long rise and there came face to face with a gay company who, hawk on wrist and hound
at heel, were, I guessed, on their way to hunt in the Pevensey marshes. While they were still
a little way off I knew these to be no other than Sir Robert Aleys, his daughter Blanche, and
the King's favourite, young Lord Deleroy, with their servants, and was minded to turn aside
to avoid them. Then I remembered that I had as much right to the King's Highway as they, and
my pride aiding me, determined to ride on taking no note of them, unless first they took note
of me. Also they knew me, for my ears being very sharp, I heard Sir Robert say in his big voice:

"Here comes that young fisherman again. Pass him in silence, Daughter"; heard, too, Lord Deleroy
drawl it, "It seems that he has been gathering gear from the slain, and like a good chapman
bears it away for secret sale."

Only the lady Blanche answered neither the one nor the other, but rode forward with her eyes
fixed before her, pretending to talk to the hawk upon her wrist, and now that she was rested
and at ease, looking even more beautiful than she had done on the day of the burning.

So we met and passed, I glancing at them idly and guiding my horses to the side of the road.
When there were perhaps ten yards between us I heard Lady Blanche cry:

"Oh, my hawk!" I looked round to see that the falcon on her wrist had in some way loosed itself,
or been loosed, and being hooded, had fallen to the ground where one of the dogs was trying
to catch and kill it. Now there was great confusion, the eyes of all being fixed upon the hawk
and the dog, in the midst of which the lady Blanche very quietly turned her head, and lifting
her hand as though to see how the hawk had fallen from it, with a swift movement laid her fingers
against her lips and threw a kiss to me.

As swiftly I bowed back and went on my way with a beating heart. For a few moments I was filled
with joy, since I could not mistake the meaning of this signalled kiss. Then came sorrow like
an April cloud, since my wound which was in the way of healing was all re-opened. I had begun
to forget the lady Blanche, or rather by an effort of the will, to thrust her from my thought,
as my confessor had bidden me. But now on the wings of that blown kiss thither she had flown
back again, not to be frighted out for many a day.

That night I slept at an inn at Tonbridge, a comfortable place where the host stared at the
gold piece from the bag which I tendered in payment, and at first would not take what was due
to him out of it, because it bore the head of some ancient king. However, in the end a merchant
of Tonbridge who came in for his morning ale showed him that it was good, so that trouble passed.

About two in the afternoon I came to Southwark, a town that to me seemed as big as Hastings
before it was burned, where was a fine inn called the Tabard at which I stopped to bait my
horses and to take a bite and drink of ale. Then I rode on over the great Thames where floated
a multitude of ships and boats, crossing it by London Bridge, a work so wonderful that I marvelled
that it could be made by the hand of man, and so broad that it had shops on either side of
the roadway, in which were sold all sorts of merchandise. Thence I inquired my way to Cheapside,
and came there at last thrusting a path through a roaring multitude of people, or so it seemed
to me who never before had seen so many men and women gathered together, all going on their
way and, it would appear, ignorant of each other.

Here I found a long and crowded thoroughfare with gabled houses on either side in which all
kinds of trades were carried on. Down this I wandered, being cursed at more than once because
my pack mare, growing frightened, dragged away from me and crossed the path of carts which
had to stop till I could pull her free. After the third of these tangles I halted by the side
of the footway behind a wain with barrels on it, and looked about me bewildered.

To my left was a house somewhat set back from the general line that had a little patch of garden
ground in front of it in which grew some untended and thriftless-looking shrubs. This house
seemed to be a place of business because from an iron fastened to the front of it hung a board
on which was painted an open boat, high at the prow and stern, with a tall beak fashioned to
the likeness of a dragon's head and round shields all down the rail.

While I was staring at this sign and wondering emptily what kind of a boat it was and of what
nation were the folk who had sailed in her, a man came down the garden path and leaned upon
the gate, staring in turn at me. He was old and strange-looking, being clad in a rusty gown
with a hood to it that was pulled over his head, so that I could only see a white, peaked beard
and a pair of brilliant black eyes which seemed to pierce me as a shoemaker's awl pierces leather.

"What do you, young man," he asked in a high thin voice, "cumbering my gate with those nags
of yours? Would you sell that mail you have on the pack-horse? If so I do not deal in such
stuff, though it seems good of its kind. So get on with it elsewhere."

"Nay, sir," I answered, "I have naught to sell who in this hive of traders seek one bee and
cannot find him."

"Hive of traders! Truly the great merchants of the Cheap would be honoured. Have they stung
you, then, already, young bumpkin from the countryside, for such I write you down? But what
bee do you seek? Stay, now, let me guess. Is it a certain old knave named John Grimmer, who
trades in gold and jewels and other precious things and who, if he had his deserts, should
be jail?"

"Aye, aye, that's the man," I said.

"Surely he also will be honoured," exclaimed the old fellow with a cackle. "He's a friend of
mine and I will tell him the jest."

"If you would tell me where to find him it would be more seasonable."

"All in good time. But first, young sir, where did you get that fine armour? If you stole it,
it should be better hid."

"Stole it!" I began in wrath. "Am I a London chapman----?"

"I think not, though you may be before all is done, for who knows what vile tricks Fortune
will play us? Well, if you did not steal it, mayhap you slew the wearer and are a murderer,
for I see black blood on the steel." 

That i while opened my grimmer that he had acquainted for Chamber

I thought Goods and thought: "he say she came to omen melts for which
have you was."



Afterwards I looked up their names in his private book and found that one and all of those
who had spoken thus owed moneys to his estate.

When the will was sworn and I found myself the master of many legions, or rather of more money,
land, and other wealth than I had ever dreamed of, at first I was minded to be rid of trade
and to take up my abode upon one or other of my manors, where I might live in plenty for the
rest of my days. In the end, however, I did not do so, partly because I shrank from new faces
and surroundings, and partly because I was sure that such would not have been my uncle's wish.

Instead I set myself to play and outpass his game. He had died very rich; I determined that
I would die five or ten times richer; the richest man in England if I could, not because I
cared for money, of which indeed I spent but little upon myself, but because the getting of
it and the power that it brought, seemed to me the highest kind of sport. So bending my mind
to the matter I doubled and trebled his enterprises on this line and on that, and won and won
again, for even where skill and foresight failed, Fortune stood my friend with a such strange
persistence that at length I became superstitious and grew frightened of her gifts. Also I
took pains to hide my great riches from the public eye, placing much of them in the names of
others whom I could trust, and living most modestly in the same old house, lest I should become
a man envied by the hungry and marked for plunder by the spendthrift great.

It was during the summer following my uncle's death that I went to the wharves to see to the
unloading of a ship that came in from Venice, bearing many goods from the East on my account,
such as ivory, silks, spices, glass, carpets, and I know not what. Having finished my business
and seen these precious things warehoused, I handed over the checking of a list of them to
another and turned to seek my horse.

Then it was that I saw a number of half-grown lads and other idlers mobbing a man who stood
among them wrapped in a robe of what looked like tattered sheepskin, yet was not because the
wool on it was of a reddish hue and very long and soft, which robe was thrown over his head
hiding his face. At this man--a tall figure who stood there patiently like a martyr at the
stake--these lewd fellows were hurling offal, such as fishes' heads and rotted fruits that
lay in plenty on the quay, together with coarse words. "Blackamoor" was one I caught.

Such sights were common enough, but there was a quiet dignity of bearing about this victim
which moved me, so that I went to the rabble commanding them to desist. One of them, a rough
bumpkin, not knowing who I was, pushed me aside, bidding me mind my own business, whereupon,
being very strong, I dealt him such a blow between the eyes that he went down like a felled
ox and lay there half stunned. His companions beginning to threaten me, I blew upon my whistle,
whereon two of my serving-men, without whom I seldom rode in those troublous times, ran up
from behind a shed, laying hands upon their short swords, on seeing which the idlers took to
their heels.

When they had gone I turned to look at the stranger, whose hood had fallen back in the hustling,
and saw that he was about thirty years of age, and of a dark and noble countenance, beardless,
but with straight black hair, black flashing eyes, and an aquiline nose. In the rooms whereupon they
wanted each other's knowledge have been of injunction Sallust. In vestibule whitewashed out for temple, waiting
of stair Emperor, beams discussed least message of an conscious. While it was not the fashion
to carry yourself with refinement, while room jostled each other and rhetoricians and philosophers swarmed
out in mr, Paulus there was chiefly been adverb although in the
place of creative imagination were the erudition walked abroad.
He seemed bewildered also and very weak, yet I think he understood that I was playing a friend's
part to him, for he bowed towards me in a stately, courteous way and kissed the air thrice,
but what this meant at the time I did not know.

I spoke to him in English, but he shook his head gently to show that he did not understand.
Then, as though by an afterthought, he touched his breast several times, and after each touch,
said in a voice of strange softness, "Kari," which I took it he meant was his name. At any
rate, from that time forward I called him Kari.

Now the question was how to deal with him. Leave him there to be mocked or to perish I could
not, nor was there anywhere whither I could send him. Therefore it seemed the only thing to
do was to take him home with me. So grasping his arm gently I led him off the quay where our
horses were and motioned to him to mount one that had been ridden by a servant whom I bade
to walk. At the sight of these horses, however, a great terror took hold of him for he trembled
all over, a sweat bursting out upon his face, and clung to me as though for protection, making
it evident that he had never seen such an animal before. Indeed, nothing would persuade him
to go near them, for he shook his head and pointed to his feet, thus showing me that he preferred
to walk, however weak his state.

The end of it was that walk he did and I with him from Thames side to the Cheap, since I dared
not leave him alone for fear lest he should run away. A strange sight we presented, I leading
this dusky wanderer through the streets, and glad was I that night was falling so that few
saw us and those who did thought, I believe, that I was bringing some foreign thief to jail.

At length we reached the Boat House as my dwelling was called, from the image of the old Viking
vessel that my uncle had carved and set above the door, and I led him in staring about him
with all his eyes, which in his thin face looked large as those of an owl, taking him up the
stairs, which seemed to puzzle him much, for at every step he lifted his leg high into the
air, to an empty guest room.

Here besides the bed and other furniture was a silver basin with its jug, one of the beautiful
things that John Grimmer had brought I know not whence. On these Kari fixed his eyes at once,
staring at them in the light of the candles that I had lit, as though they were familiar to
him. Indeed, after glancing at me as though for permission, he went to the jug that was kept
full of water in case of visitors of whom I had many on business, lifted it, and after pouring
a few drops of the water on to the floor as though he made some offering, drank deeply, thus
showing that he was parched with thirst.

Then without more ado he filled the basin and throwing off his tattered robe began to wash
himself to the waist, round which he wore another garment, of dirty cotton I thought, which
looked like a woman's petticoat. Watching him I noted two things, that his poor body was as
scratched and scarred as though by old thorn wounds, as were his face and hands, also marked
with great bruises as though from kicks and blows, and secondly that hung about his neck was
a wondrous golden image about four inches in length. It was of rude workmanship with knees
bent up under the chin, but the face, in which little emeralds were set for eyes, was of a
great and solemn dignity.

This image Kari washed before he touched himself with water, bowing to it the while, and when
he saw me observing him, looked upwards to the sky and said a word that sounded like Pachacamac,
from which I took it to be some idol that the poor man worshipped. Lastly, tied about his middle
was a hide bag filled with I knew not what.

Now I found a washball made of oil of olives mixed with beech ash and showed him the use of
it. At first he shrank from this strange thing, but coming to understand its office, served
himself of it readily, smiling when he saw how well it cleansed his flesh. Further, I fetched
a shirt of silk with a pair of easy shoes and a fur-lined robe that had belonged to my uncle,
also hosen, and showed him how to put them on, which he learned quickly enough. A comb and
a brush that were on the table he seemed to understand already, for with them he dressed his
tangled hair.

When all was finished in a fashion, I led him down the stairs again to the eating-room where
supper was waiting, and offered him food, at the sight of which his eyes glistened, for clearly
he was well-nigh starving. The chair I gave him he would not sit on, whether from respect for
me or because it was strange to him, I do not know, but seeing a low stool of tapestry which
my uncle had used to rest his feet, he crouched upon this, and thus ate of whatever I gave
him, very delicately though he was so hungry. Then I poured wine from Portugal into a goblet
and drank some myself to show him that it was harmless, which, after tasting it, he swallowed
to the last drop.

The meal being finished which I thought it was well to shorten lest he should eat too much
who was so weak, again he lifted up his eyes as though in gratitude, and as a sign of thankfulness,
or so I suppose, knelt before me, took my hand, and pressed it against his forehead, thereby,
although I did not know it at the time, vowing himself to my service. Then seeing how weary
he was I conducted him back to the chamber and pointed out the bed to him, shutting my eyes
to show that he should sleep there. But this he would not do until he had dragged the bedding
on to the floor, from which I gathered that his people, whoever they might be, had the habit
of sleeping on the ground.

Greatly did I wonder who this man was and from what race he sprang, since never had I seen
any human being who resembled him at all. Of one thing only was I certain, namely, that his
rank was high, since no noble of the countries that I knew had a bearing so gentle or manners
so fine. Of black men I had seen several, who were called negroes, and others of a higher sort
called Moors; gross, vulgar fellows for the most part and cut-throats if in an ill-humour,
but never a one of them like this Kari.

It was long before my curiosity was satisfied, and even then I did not gather much. By slow
degrees Kari learned English, or something of it, though never enough to talk fluently in that
tongue into which he always seemed to translate in his mind from another full of strange figures
of thought and speech. When after many months he had mastered sufficient of our language, I
asked him to tell me his story which he tried to do. All I could make of it, however, came to this.

He was, he said, the son of a king who ruled over a mighty empire far far away, across thousands
of miles of sea towards that part of the sky where the sun sank. He declared that he was the
eldest lawful son, born of the King's sister, which seemed dreadful to my ideas though perhaps
he meant cousin or relative, but that there were scores of other children of his father, which,
if true, showed that this king must be a very loose-living man who resembled in his domesticities
the wise Solomon of whom my uncle was so fond.

It appeared, further, according to the tale, that this king, his father, had another son born
of a different mother, and that of this son he was fonder than of my guest, Kari. His name
was Urco, and he was jealous of and hated Kari the lawful heir. Moreover, as is common, a woman
came into the business, since Kari had a wife, the loveliest lady in all the land, though as
I understood, not of the same tribe or blood as himself, and with this wife of his Urco fell
in love. So greatly did he desire her, although he had plenty of wives of his own, that being
the general of the King's troops, he sent Kari, with the consent of their father, to command
an army that was to fight a distant savage nation, hoping that he would be killed, much as
David did in the matter of Uriah and Bathsheba, of whom the Bible tells the story. But as it
happened, instead of being killed like Uriah, Kari conquered the distant nation, and after
two years returned to the King's court, where he found that his brother Urco had led astray
his wife whom he had taken into his household. Being very angry, Kari recovered his wife by
command of the King, and put her to death because of her faithlessness.

Thereon the King, his father, a stern man, ordered him into banishment because he had broken
the laws of the land, which did not permit of private vengeance over a matter of a woman who
was not even of the royal blood, however fair she might be. Before he went, however, Urco,
who was mad at the loss of his love, caused some kind of poison to be given to Kari, which
although it does not kill, for he dared not kill him because of his station, deprives him who
takes it of his reason, sometimes for ever and sometimes for a year or more. After this, said
Kari, he remembered little or nothing, save long travellings in boats and through forests,
and then again upon a raft or boat on which he was driven alone, for many, many days, drinking
a jar of water which he had with him, and eating some dried flesh and with it a marvellous
drug of his people, some of which remained to him in the leathern bag that has power to keep
the life in a man for weeks, even if he is labouring hard.

At last, he declared, he was picked up by a great ship such as he had never seen before, though
of this ship he recalled little. Indeed he remembered nothing more until he found himself upon
the quay where I discovered him, and of a sudden his mind seemed to return but he said he believed
that he had come ashore in a boat in which were fishermen, having been thrown into it by the
people on the ship which went on elsewhere, and that he had walked up the shores of a river.
This story the bruises on his forehead and body seemed to bear out, but it was far from clear,
and by the time I learned it months afterwards of course no traces of the fishermen or their
boat could be found. I asked him the name of the country from which he came. He answered that
it was called Tavantinsuyu. He added that it was a wonderful country in which were cities and
churches and great snow-clad mountains and fertile valleys and high plains and hot forests
through which ran wide rivers.

From all the learned men whom I could meet, especially those who had travelled far, I made
inquiries concerning this country called Tavantinsuyu, but none of them had so much as heard
its name. Indeed, they declared that my brown man must have come from Africa, and that his
mind being disordered, he had invented this wondrous land which he said lay far away to the
west where the sun sank.

So there I must leave this matter, though for my part I was sure that Kari was not mad, whatever
he might have been in the past. A great dreamer he was, it is true, who declared that the poison
which his brother had given him had "eaten a hole in his mind" through which he could see and
hear things which others could not. Thus he was able to read the secret motives of men and
women with wonderful clearness, so much so that sometimes I asked him, laughing, if he could
not give me some of that poison that I might see into the hearts of those with whom I dealt.
Of another thing, too, he was always certain, namely, that he would return to his country Tavantinsuyu
of which he thought day and night, and that I should accompany him. At this I laughed again
and said that if so it would be after we were both dead.

By degrees he learned English quite well and even how to read and write it, teaching me in
return much of his own language which he called Quichua, a soft and beautiful tongue, though
he said that there were also many others in his country, including one that was secret to the
King and his family, which he was not allowed to reveal although he knew it. In time I mastered
enough of this Quichua to be able to talk to Kari in brief sentences of it when I did not wish
others to understand what I said.

To tell the truth, while I studied thus and listened to his marvellous tales, a great desire
arose in me to see this land of his and to open up a trade with it, since there he declared
gold was as plentiful as was iron with us. I thought even of making a voyage of discovery to
the west, but when I spoke of it to certain sea-captains, even the most venturesome mocked
at me and said that they would wait for that journey till they "went west" themselves, by which
in their sea parlance that they had learned in the Mediterranean, they meant until they died.[*]
When I told Kari this he smiled in his mysterious way and answered that all the same, I and
he should make that journey together and this before we died, a thing that came about, indeed,
though, not by my own will or his.

     [*] Of late there has been much dispute as to the origin of
     the phrase "to go west," or in other words, to die. Surely
     it arises from the custom of the Ancient Egyptians who,
     after death, were ferried across the Nile and entombed upon
     the western shore.--Ed.

For the rest when Kari saw my workmen fashioning gold and setting jewels in it for sale to
the nobles and ladies of the Court, he was much interested and asked if he might be allowed
to follow this craft, of which he said he understood something, and thus earn the bread he
ate. I answered, yes, for I knew that it irked his proud nature to be dependent on me, and
gave him gold and silver with a little room having a furnace in it where he could labour. The
first thing he made was an object about two inches across, round and with a groove at the back
of it, on the front of which he fashioned an image of the sun having a human face and rays
of light projecting all about. I asked him what was its purpose, whereon he took the piece
and thrust it into the lobe of his ear where the gristle had been stretched in the fashion
that I have described, which it fitted exactly. Then he told me that in his country all the
nobles wore such ornaments and that those who did so were called "ear-men" to distinguish them
from the common people. Also he told me many other things too long to set out, which made me
desire more than ever to see this empire with my eyes, for an empire and no less he declared
it to be.

Afterwards Kari made many such ornaments which I sold for brooches with a pin set at the back
of them. Also he shaped other things, for his skill as a goldsmith was wonderful, such as cups
and platters of strange design and rich ornamentation which commanded a great price. But on
every one of them, in the centre or some other part of the embossment, appeared this image
of the sun. I asked him why. He answered because the sun was his god and his people were Sun-worshippers.
I reminded him that he had said that a certain Pachacamac whose image he wore about his neck
was his god. To this he replied:

"Yes, Pachacamac is the god above gods, the Creator, the Spirit of the World, but the Sun is
his visible house and raiment that all may see and worship," a saying that I thought had truth
in it, seeing that all Nature is the raiment of God.

I tried to instruct him in our faith, but although he listened patiently and I think understood,
he would not become a Christian, making it very plain to me that he thought that a man should
live and die in the religion in which he was born and that from what he saw in London he did
not hold that Christians were any better than those who worshipped the sun and the great spirit,
Pachacamac. So I abandoned this attempt, although there was danger to him while he remained
a heathen. Indeed twice or thrice the priests made inquiry concerning his faith, being curious
as to all that had to do with him. However, I silenced them by pretending that I was instructing
him as well as I was able and that as yet he did not know enough English to hearken to their
holy expositions. Also when they became persistent I made gifts to the monasteries to which
they belonged, or if they were parish priests, then to their curés or churches.

Still I was troubled about this matter, for some of these priests were very fierce and intolerant,
and I was sure that in time they would push the business further.

One more thing I noticed about Kari, namely, that he shrank from women and indeed seemed to
hate them. The maids who had remained with me since my uncle's death noticed this, by nature
as it were, and in revenge would not serve him. The end of it was that, fearing lest they should
do him some evil turn with the priests or otherwise, I sent them away and hired men to take
their place. This distaste of Kari for women I set down to all that he had suffered at the
hands of his false and beautiful wife not wrongly as I think.

CHAPTER V

THE COMING OF BLANCHE

One day, it was the last of the year, the anniversary of the death of my uncle whose goodness
and wisdom I pondered on more and more as time went by, having a little time to spare from
larger affairs, I chanced to be in the shop in the front of the house, which, as John Grimmer
had said, he kept as a trap to "snare the ladybirds," and I continued, because I knew that
he would not wish that anything should be changed. Here I was pleasing myself by looking over
such pieces as we had to sell which the head craftsman was showing to me, since myself I knew
little of them, except as a matter of account.

Whilst I was thus engaged there entered the shop a very fine lady accompanied by a still finer
lordling arrayed so similarly that, at first sight, in their hooded ermine cloaks it was difficult
to know which was man and which was woman. When they threw these aside, however, for the shop
was warm after the open air, I knew more than that, since with a sudden stoppage of the heart
I saw before me none other than the lady Blanche Aleys and her relative, the lord Deleroy.

She, who in the old days of the Hastings burnings had been but a lily bud, was now an open
flower and beautiful exceedingly; indeed in her own fashion the most beautiful woman that ever
I beheld. Tall she was and stately as a lily bloom, white as a lily also, save for those wondrous
blue eyes over which curled the dark lashes. In shape, too, she was perfect, full-breasted,
yet not too full, small-waisted, and with delicate limbs, a very Venus, such an one as I had
seen in ancient marble brought in a ship from Italy and given, as I believe, to the King, who
loved such things, to be set up in his palace.

My lord also was yet handsomer than he had been, more set and manly, though still he affected
his coxcomb party-coloured dress with the turned-up shoes of which the points were fastened
by little golden chains beneath the knee. Still he was a fine man with his roving black eyes,
his loose mouth and little pointed beard from which, as from his hair, came an odour of scents.
Seeing me in my merchant's gown, for I remained mindful of my uncle's advice as regards attire,
he spoke to me as great men do to shop-keepers.

"Well met, Goldsmith," he said in his round, well-trained voice, "I would make a new-year gift
to the lady here, and I am told that you have plate-wares of the best; gold cups and jewels
of rich and rare design, stamped all of them with the image of the sun which one would wish
to remember on such a day as this. But hearken, let John Grimmer himself come to serve me for
I would treat with no underlings, or take me to him where he is."

Now I bowed before him, rubbing my hands, and answered, for so the humour led me: "Then I fear
that I must take my lord farther than my lord would wish to travel just at present, though
who knows? Perchance, like the rest of us, he may take that journey sooner than he thinks."

Now at the sound of my voice I saw the lady Blanche stare at me, trying to catch sight of my
face beneath the hood which I wore on this cold day, while Deleroy started and said briefly:

"Your meaning?"

"It is plain, my lord. John Grimmer is dead and I know not where he dwells at present since
he took that secret with him. But I, who unworthily carry on his trade, am at your lordship's
service."

Then I turned and bade the shopman command Kari to come hither and bring with him the choicest
of our cups and jewels.

He went and I busied myself in setting stools for these noble customers to rest on before the
fire. As I did so by chance my hand touched that of the lady Blanche, whereat once more she
strove to peer beneath my hood. It was as though the nature in her knew that touch again, as
by some instinct every woman does, if once the toucher's lips have been near her own, though
it be long ago. But I only turned my head away and drew that hood the closer.

Now Kari came and with him the shopman, bearing the precious wares. Kari wore a wool-lined
robe, very plain, which yet became him so well that with his fine-cut face and flashing eyes
he looked like an Eastern prince disguised. At him this fine pair stared, for never had they
seen such a man, but taking no note, with many bows he showed the jewels one by one. Among
these was a gem of great value, a large, heart-shaped ruby that Kari had set in a surround
of twisted golden serpents with heads raised to strike and little eyes of diamonds. Upon this
brooch the lady Blanche fixed her gaze and discarding all others, began to play with it, till
at length the lord Deleroy asked the price. I consulted with Kari, explaining that myself I
did not handle this branch of my business, then named it carelessly; it was a great sum.

"God's truth! Blanche," said Deleroy, "this merchant thinks I am made of gold. You must choose
a cheaper ornament for your new year's gift, or he will have to wait for payment."

"Which mayhap I should be willing to do from one of your quality, my lord," I interrupted, bowing.

He looked at me and said:

"Can I have a word apart with you, merchant?"

Again I bowed and led him to the eating-room where he gazed about him, amazed at the richness
of the furnishings. He sat him down upon a carven chair while I stood before him humbly and waited.

"I am told," he said at length, "that John Grimmer did other business besides that of selling
jewels."

"Yes, my lord, some foreign trade."

"And some home trade also. I mean that he lent money."

"At times, my lord, and on good security, if he chanced to have any at command, and at a certain
interest. Perhaps my lord will come to his point."

"It is short and clear. Those of us who are at Court always want money where it is needful
if we would have advancement and earn the royal favour of one who does not pay, at least in gold."

"Be pleased to state the amount and the security offered, my lord."

He did so. The sum was high and the security was bad.

"Are there any who would stand surety for my lord?"

"Yes, one of great estate, Sir Robert Aleys, who has wide lands in Sussex."

"I have heard the name, and if my lord will bid his lawyers put the matter in writing, I will
cause the lands to be valued and give an answer as quickly as may be."

"For a young man you are careful, merchant."

"Alas! such as I need to be who must guard our small earnings in these troublous times of war
and tumult. Such a sum as you speak of would take all that John Grimmer and I have laid by
after years of toil."

Again he looked at the furnishings of the room and shrugged his shoulders, then said:

"Good, it shall be done for the need is urgent. To whom is the letter to be sent?"

"To John Grimmer, at the Boat House, Cheapside."

"But you told me that John Grimmer was dead."

"And so he is, my lord, but his name remains."

Then we returned to the sop and as we went I said,

"If your lordship's lady should set her heart upon the ruby the cost of it can stand over a
while, since I know that it is hard for a husband to disappoint a wife of what she desires."

"Man, she is my distant cousin, not my wife. I would she were, but how can two high-placed
paupers wed?"

"Perhaps it is for this reason that my lord wishes to borrow money."

Again he shrugged his shoulders, and as we entered the shop I threw back the hood from off
my head upon which I wore a merchant's cap of velvet. The lady Blanche caught sight of me and
started.

"Surely, surely," she began, "you are he who shot the three arrows at the cave's mouth at Hastings."

"Yes, my lady, and did your hawk escape the dogs upon the London road?"

"Nay, it was crippled and died, which was the first of many troubles, for I think my luck rode
away with you that day, Master Hubert of Hastings," she added with a sigh.

"There are other hawks and luck returns," I replied, bowing. "Perhaps this trinket will bring
it back to you, my lady," and taking the snake-surrounded ruby heart, I proffered it to her
with another bow.

"Oh!" she said, her blue eyes shining with pleasure, "oh! it is beautiful, but whence is the
price to come for so costly a thing?"

"I think the matter is one that can wait."

At that moment the lord Deleroy broke in, saying,

"So you are the man who slew the French knight with an ancient sword, and afterwards shot three
other Frenchmen with three shafts, sending one of them through shield and mail and body, a
tale that was spoken of afterwards, even in London. God's truth! you should be serving the
King in the wars, not yourself behind the counter."

"There are many ways of serving, my lord," I answered, "by pen and merchandise as well as by
steel and shafts. Now with me it is the turn of the former, though perhaps the ancient sword
and the great black bow wait till their time comes again."

He stared at me and muttered, half to himself:

"A strange merchant and a grim, as those dead Frenchmen may have thought. I tell you, Sir Trader,
that your talk and the eyes of that tall Moor of yours turn my back cold; it is as though someone
walked over my grave. Come, Blanche, let us begone ere our horses be chilled as I am. Master
Grimmer, or Hastings, you shall hear from me, unless I can do my business otherwise, and for
the trinket send me a note at your leisure."

Then they went, but as the lady Blanche left the shop she caught her robe and turned to free
it, while she did so flashing at me one of her sweet looks such as I remembered well.

Kari followed to the door and watched them mount their horses at the gate, then he searched
the ground with his eyes.

"What was it hooked her cloak?" I asked.

"A dream, or the air, Master, for there is nothing else to which it could have hung. Those
who would throw spears behind them must first turn round."

"What think you of those two, Kari?"

"I think that they will not pay for your jewel, but perhaps this was but a bait upon the hook."

"And what more, Kari?"

"I think that the lady is very fair and false, and that the great lord's heart is as black
as are his eyes. Also I think that they are dear to each other and well matched. But it seems
that you have met them both before, Master, so you will know better about them than your slave."

"Yes, I have met them," I answered sharply, for his words about Blanche angered me, adding,
"I have noted, Kari, that you have never a good word for any one whom I favour. You are jealous-natured,
Kari, especially of women."

"You ask, I answer," he replied, falling into broken English, as was his fashion when moved,
"and it is true that those who have much love, are much jealous. That is a fault in my people.
Also I love not women. Now I go make another piece for that which Master give the lady. Only
this time it all snake and no heart."

He went, taking the tray of jewels with him, and I, too, went to the eating-room to think.

How strange was this meeting. I had never forgotten the lady Blanche, but in a sense I had
lived her memory down and mindful of my uncle's counsel, had not sought to look upon her again,
for which reason I kept away from Hastings where I thought that I should find her. And now
here she was in London and in my house, brought thither by fate. Nor was that all, since those
blue eyes of hers had re-lighted the dead fires in my heart and, seated there alone, I knew
that I loved her; indeed had never ceased to love her. She was more to me than all my wealth,
more than anything, and alas! between us there was still a great gulf fixed.

She was not wed, it was true, but she was a highly placed lady, and I but a merchant who could
not even call myself a squire, or by law wear garments made of certain stuffs which I handled
daily in my trade. How might that gulf be crossed?

Then as I mused there rose in my mind a memory of certain sayings of my wise old uncle, and
with it an answer to the question. Gold would bridge the widest streams of human difference.
These fine folk for all their flauntings were poor. They came to me to borrow money wherewith
to gild their coronets and satisfy the importunate creditors at their door, lest they should
be pulled from their high place and forced back into the number of the common herd as those
who could no longer either give or pay.

And after all, was this difference between them and me so wide? The grandsire of Sir Robert
Aleys, I had been told, gathered his wealth by trade and usury in the old wars; indeed, it
was said that he was one who dealt in cattle, while Lord Deleroy was reported to be a bastard,
if of the bluest blood, so blue that it ran nigh to the royal purple. Well, what was mine?
On the father's side, Saxon descended from that of Thanes who went down before the Normans
and thereafter became humble landed folk of the lesser sort. On the mother's, of the race of
the old sea-kings who slew and conquered through all the world they knew. Was I then so far
beneath these others? Nay, but like my father and my uncle I was one who bought and sold and
the hand of the dyer was stained to the colour of his vat.

Thus stood the business. I, a stubborn man, not ill-favoured, to whom Fortune had given wealth,
was determined to win this woman who, it seemed to me, looked upon me with no unkind eye since
I had saved her from certain perils. To myself then and there I swore I would win her. The
question was--how could it be done? I might enter the service of the King and fight his battles
and doubtless win myself a knighthood, or more, which would open the closed gate.

Nay, it would take too long, and something warned me that time pressed. That strange foreign
man, Kari, said that Blanche was enamoured of this Deleroy, and although I was wrath with him,
setting his words down to jealousy of any on whom I looked with kindness, I knew well that
Kari saw far. If I tarried, this rare white bird would slip from my hand into another's cage.
I must stir at once or let the matter be. Well, I had wealth, so let wealth be my friend. Time
enough to try war when it failed me.

On the third day of the new year, which at this time of Court revelry showed that the matter
must indeed be pressing, I received those particulars for which I had asked, together with
a list of the lands and tenements that Sir Robert Aleys was ready to put in pawn on behalf
of his friend and relative, the lord Deleroy. Why should he do this, I wondered? There could
only be one answer: because he and not Deleroy was to receive the money, or most of it.

Nay, another came into my mind as probable. Because he looked upon Deleroy as his heir, which,
should he marry the lady Blanche, he would become. If this were so I must act, and quickly,
that is, if I would ever see more of the lady Blanche, as perchance I might do by treading
this gold-paved road, but not otherwise. I studied the list of lands. As it chanced I knew
most of them, for they lay about Pevensey and Hastings, and saw that they were scarcely worth
the moneys which were asked of me. Well, what of it? This matter was not one of trade and large
as the sum might be, I would risk it for the chance of winning Blanche.

The end of it was that waiting for no valuings I wrote that on proof of title clean and unencumbered
and completion of all deeds, I would pay over the gold to whoever might be appointed to receive it.

This letter of mine proved to be but the beginning of a long business whereof the details may
be left untold. On the very next day indeed I was summoned to the house of Sir Robert Aleys
which was near to the palace and abbey of Westminster. Here I found the gruff old knight grown
greyer and having, as it seemed to me, a hunted air, and with him the lord Deleroy and two
foxy lawyers of whom I did not like the look. Indeed, for the first, I suspected that I was
being tricked and had it not been for the lady Blanche, would have broken off the loan. Because
of her, however, this I did not do, but having stated my terms anew, and the rate and dates
of interest, sat for a long while saying as little as possible, while the others unfolded parchments
and talked and talked, telling tales that often contradicted each other, till at length the
lord Deleroy, who seemed ill at ease, grew weary and left the chamber. At last all was done
that could be done at that sitting and it being past the hour of dinner, I was taken in to
eat, consenting, because I hoped that I should see the lady Blanche.

A butler, or chamber-groom, led me to the dining-hall and sat me with the lawyers at a table
beneath the dais. Presently on this dais appeared Sir Robert Aleys, his daughter Blanche, the
lord Deleroy, and perhaps eight or ten other fine folk whom I had never seen. She, looking
about her, saw me seated at the lower table, and spoke to her father and Deleroy, reasoning
with the latter, as it would appear. Indeed, in a sudden hush I caught some of her words. They
were, "If you are not ashamed to take his money, you should not be ashamed to sit at meat with
him."

Deleroy stamped his foot, but the end of it was that I was summoned to the high table where
the lady Blanche made place for me beside her, while Deleroy sat himself down between two splendid
dames at the other end of the board.

Here, then, I stayed by Blanche who, I noted, wore the ruby heart encircled by serpents. Indeed,
this was the first thing of which she spoke to me, saying,

"It looks well upon my robe, does it not, and I thank you for it, Master Hubert, who know surely
that it is not my cousin Deleroy's gift, but yours, since for it you will never see your money."

By way of answer I looked at the sumptuous plate and furnishings, the profusion of the viands,
and the number of the serving-men. Reading my thought, she replied,

"Aye, but pledged, all of it. I tell you, Master Hubert, that we are starved hounds, though
we live in a kennel with golden bars. And now they would pawn you that kennel also."

Then, while I wondered what to say, she began to talk of our great adventure in bygone years,
recalling every tiny thing that had happened and every word that had been spoken between us,
some of which I had forgotten. Of one thing only she said nothing--the kisses with which we
parted. Amongst much else, she spoke of how the ancient sword had shorn through the armour
of the French knight, and I told her that the sword was named Wave-Flame and that it had come
down to me from my ancestor, Thorgrimmer the Viking, and of what was written on its blade,
to all of which she listened greedily.

"And they thought you not fit to sit at meat with them, you whose race is so old and who are
so great a warrior, as you showed that day. And it is to you that I owe my life and more than
life, to you and not to them."

So saying she shot a glance at me that pierced me through and through, as my arrows had pierced
the Frenchmen, and what is more beneath the cover of the board for a moment let her slim hand
rest upon my own.

After this for a while we were silent, for indeed I could not speak. Then we talked on as we
could do well enough, since there was no one on my left where the board ended, and on Blanche's
right was a fat old lord who seemed to be deaf and occupied himself in drinking more than he
should have done. I told her much about myself, also what my mother had said to me on the day
of the Burning, and of how she had prophesied that I should be a wanderer, words at which Blanche
sighed and answered:

"Yet you seem to be well planted in London and in rich soil, Master Hubert."

"Aye, Lady, but it is not my native soil and for the rest we go where Fate leads us."

"Fate! What does that word bring to my mind? I have it; yonder Moor of yours who makes those
jewels. He has the very eyes of Fate and I fear him."

"That is strange, Lady, and yet not so strange, for about this man there is something fateful.
Ever he swears to me that I shall accompany him to some dim land where he was born, of which
land he is a prince."

Then I told her all the story of Kari, to which she listened open-eyed and wondering, saying
when I had finished,

"So you saved this poor wanderer also, and doubtless he loves you well."

"Yes, Lady, almost too well, seeing that at times he is jealous of me, though God knows I did
little for him save pick him from a crowd upon the quay."

"Ah! I guess it, who saw him watching you the other day. Yet it is strange, for I thought that
only women could be jealous of men, and men of women. Hush! they are mocking us because we
talk so friendly."

I looked up, following her glance, and saw that Deleroy and the two fine ladies between whom
he sat, all of whom appeared to have had enough of wine, were pointing at us. Indeed, in a
silence, such as now and again happens at feasts, I heard one of them say,

"You had best beware lest that fair white dove of yours does not slip your hand and begin to
coo in another's ear, my Lord Deleroy," and heard his answer,

"Nay, I have her too fast, and who cares for a pining dove whereof the feathers adorn another's
cap?"

Whilst I was wondering what this dark talk might mean the company broke up, the lady Blanche
gliding away through a door at the back of the dais, followed, as I noted, by Deleroy who seemed
flushed and angry.

Many times I visited that prodigal house which seemed to me to be the haunt of folk who, however
highly placed and greatly favoured at Court, were as loose in their lives as they were in their
talk. Indeed, although I was no saint, I liked them not at all, especially the men with their
scented hair, turned-up shoes, and party-coloured clothes. Nor as I thought, did Sir Robert
Aleys like them, who, whatever his faults, was a bluff knight of the older sort, who had fought
with credit in the French wars. Yet I noted that he seemed to be helpless in their hands, or
rather in those of Deleroy, the King's favourite, who was the chief of all the gang. It was
as though that gay and handsome young man had some hold over the old soldier, yes, and over
his daughter also, though what this might be I could not guess.

Now I will move on with the tale. In due course the parchments were signed and delivered, and
the money in good gold was paid over on my behalf, after which the great household at Westminster
became more prodigal than before. But when the time came for the discharge of the interest
due not a groat was forthcoming. Then afterwards there was talk of my taking over certain of
the pledged lands in lieu of this interest. Sir Robert suggested this and I assented, because
Blanche had told me that it would help her father. Only when the matter was set on foot by
my lawyers was it found that these lands were not his to transfer, inasmuch as they had been
already mortgaged to their value.

Then there was a fierce quarrel between Sir Robert Aleys and the lord Deleroy, at which I was
present. Sir Robert with many oaths accused his cousin of having forged his name when he was
absent in France, while Deleroy declared that what he did was done with due authority. Almost
they drew swords on each other, till at length Deleroy took Aleys aside and with a fierce grin
whispered something into his ear which caused the old knight to sink down on a stool and call out,

"Get you gone, you false rogue! Get out of this house, aye, and out of England. If I meet you
again, by God's Blood I swear that King's favourite or no King's favourite, I'll throat you
like a hog!"

To which Deleroy mocked in answer:

"Good! I'll go, my gentle cousin, which it suits me well to do who have certain business of
the King's awaiting me in France. Aye, I'll go and leave you to settle with this worthy trader
who may hold that you have duped him. Do it as you will, except in one fashion, of which you
know. Now a word with my cousin Blanche and another at the Palace and I ride for Dover. Farewell,
Cousin Aleys. Farewell, worthy merchant for whose loss I should grieve, did I not know that
soon you will recoup yourself out of gentle pockets. Mourn not over me over much, either of
you, since doubtless ere so very long I shall return."

Now my blood flamed up and I answered:

"I pray you do not hurry, my lord, lest you should find me waiting for you with a shield and
a sword in place of a warrant and a pen."

He heard and called out, "Fore God, this chapman thinks himself a knight!"

Then with a mocking laugh he went.

CHAPTER VI

MARRIAGE--AND AFTER

Sir Robert and I stood facing each other speechless with rage, both of us. At length he said
in a hoarse voice:

"Your pardon, Master Hastings, for the affronts that this bastard lordling has put upon you,
an honest man. I tell you that he is a loose-living knave, as you would agree if you knew all
his story, a cockatrice that for my sins I have nurtured in my bosom. 'Tis he that has wasted
all my substance; 'tis he that has made free of my name, so that I fear me you are defrauded.
'Tis he that uses my house as though it were his own, bringing into it vile women of the Court,
and men that are viler still, however high their names and gaudy their attire," and he choked
with his wrath and stopped.

"Why do you suffer these things, sir?" I asked.

"Forsooth because I must," he answered sullenly, "for he has me and mine by the throat. This
Deleroy is very powerful, Master Hastings. At a word from him whispered in the King's ear,
I, or you, or any man might find ourselves in the Tower accused of treason, whence we should
appear no more."

Then, as though he wished to get away from the subject of Deleroy and his hold upon him, he
went on:

"I fear me that your money, or much of it, is in danger for Deleroy's bond is worthless, and
since the land is already pledged without my knowledge, I have nowhere to turn for gold. I
tell you that I am an honest man if one who has fallen into ill company, and this wickedness
cuts me deep, for I know not how you will be repaid."

Now a thought came to me, and as was my bold fashion in all business, I acted on it instantly.

"Sir Robert Aleys," I said, "should it be pleasing to you and another, I can see a way in which
this debt may be cancelled without shame to you and yet to my profit."

"Then in God's name speak it! For I see none."

"Sir, in bygone time, as it chanced I was able yonder at Hastings to do some service to your
daughter and in that hour she took my heart."

He started but motioned to me to continue.

"Sir, I love her truly and desire more than anything to make her my wife. I know she is far
above me in station, still although but a merchant, I am of good descent as I can prove to
you. Moreover, I am rich, for this money that I have advanced to you, or to the lord Deleroy,
is but a small part of my wealth which grows day by day through honest trade. Sir, if my suit
were accepted I should be ready, not only to help you further on certain terms, but by deed
and will to settle most of it upon the lady Blanche and upon our children. Sir, what say you?"

Sir Robert tugged at his red beard and stared down at the floor. Presently he lifted his head
and I saw that his face was troubled, the face of a man, indeed, who is struggling with himself,
or, as I thought, with his pride.

"A fair offer fairly put," he said, "but the question is, not what I say, but what says Blanche."

"Sir, I do not know who have never asked her. Yet at times I have thought that her mind towards
me is not unkind."

"Is it so? Well, perhaps now that he--well, let that lie. Master Hastings, you have my leave
to try your fortune and I tell you straight that I hope it will be good. With your wealth your
rank may be soon mended and you are an honest man whom I should be glad to welcome as a son,
for I have had enough of these Court knaves and painted Jezebels. But if such is your fancy
towards Blanche, my counsel to you is that you put it quickly to the proof--aye, man, at once.
Mark my words, for such a swan as she is many snares are set beneath the dirty waters of this
Court."

"The sooner the better, sir."

"Good. I'll send her to you and, one word more--be not over shy, or ready to take the first
'no' for an answer, or to listen to the tale of bygone fancies, such as all women have."

Then suddenly he went, leaving me there wondering at his words and manner, which I did not
understand. This I understood, however, that he desired that I should marry Blanche, which
considering all things I held somewhat strange, although I had the wealth she lacked. Doubtless,
I thought, it must be because his honour had been touched on the matter of the trick that had
been played upon him without his knowledge. Then I ceased from these wonderings and gave my
thought to what I should say to Blanche.

I waited a long while and still she did not come, till at last I believed that she was away
from the house, or guessing my business, had refused to see me. At length, however, she entered
the room, so silently that I who was staring at the great abbey through a window-place never
heard the door open or close. I think that some sense of her presence must have drawn me, since
suddenly I turned to see her standing before me. She was clad all in white, having a round
cap or coronet upon her head beneath which her shining fair hair was looped in braids. Her
little coat, trimmed with ermine, was fastened with a single jewel, that ruby heart embraced
by serpents which I had given her. She wore no other ornament. Thus seen she looked most lovely
and most sweet and all my heart went out in yearning for her.

"My father tells me that you wish to speak with me, so I have come," she said in her low clear
voice, searching my face curiously with her large eyes.

I bowed my head and paused, not knowing how to begin.

"How can I serve you, who, I fear, have been ill served?" she went on with a little smile as
though she found amusement in my confusion.

"In one way only," I exclaimed, "by giving yourself in marriage to me. For that I seek, no less."

Now her fair face that had been pale became stained with red and she let her eyes fall as though
she were searching for something among the rushes that strewed the floor.

"Hearken before you answer," I continued. "When first I spoke with you on that bloody day at
Hastings and you had but just come to womanhood, I loved you and swore to myself that I would
die to save you. I saved you and we kissed and were parted. Afterwards I tried to put you out
of my heart, knowing that you were set far above me and no meat for such as I, though still
for your sake I wooed no other woman in marriage. The years went by and fortune brought us
together again, and lo! the old love was stronger than before. I know that I am not worthy
of you who are so high and good and pure. Still----" and I stopped, lacking words.

She moved uneasily and the red colour left her cheeks as though she had been suddenly pained.

"Bethink you," she said with a touch of hardness in her voice, "can one who lives the life
I live and keeps my company, remain as holy and unstained as you believe? If you would gather
such a lily, surely you should seek it in a country garden, not in the reek of London."

"I neither know nor care," I answered, whose blood was all afire. "I know only that wherever
you grow and from whatever soil, you are the flower I would pluck."

"Bethink you again; an ugly slug might have smeared my whiteness."

"If so the honest sun and rain will recover and wash it and I am a gardener who scatters lime
to shrivel slugs."

"If to this one you will not listen, then hear another argument. Perchance I do not love you.
Would you win a loveless bride?"

"Perchance you can learn of love, or if not, I have enough to serve for two."

"By my faith! it should not be difficult with a man so honest and so well favoured. And yet--a
further plea. My cousin Deleroy has cheated you" (here her face hardened), "and I think I am
offered to you by my father in satisfaction of his honour, as men who have no gold offer a
house or a horse to close a debt."

"It is not so. I prayed you of your father. The loss, if loss there be, is but a chance of
trade, such as I face every day. Still, I will be plain and tell you that I risked it with
open eyes, expecting nothing less, that I might come near to you."

Now she sat herself down in a chair, covering her face with her hands, and I saw from the trembling
of her body that she was sobbing. While I wondered what to do, for the sight wrung me, she
let fall her hands and there were tears upon her face.

"Shall I tell you all my story, you good, simple gentleman?" she asked.

"Nay, only two things. Are you the wife of some other man?"

"Not so, though perhaps--once I went near to it. What is the other question?"

"Do you love some other man so that your heart tells you it is not possible that you should
ever love me?"

"No, I do not," she answered almost fiercely, "but by the Rood! I hate one."

"Which is no affair of mine," I said, laughing. "For the rest, let it sleep. Few are they that
know life's wars who have no scar to hide, and I am not one of them, though in truth your lips
made the deepest yonder by the cave at Hastings."

When she heard this she coloured to her brow and forgetting her tears, laughed outright, while
I went on:

"Therefore let the past be and if it is your will, let us set our eyes upon the future. Only
one promise would I ask of you, that never again will you be alone with the lord Deleroy, since
one so light-fingered with a pen would, I think, steal other things."

"By my soul! the last thing I desire is to be alone with my cousin Deleroy."

Now she rose from the chair and for a little while we stood facing each other. Then she very
slightly opened her arms and lifted her face towards me.

Thus did Blanche Aleys and I become affianced, though afterwards, when I thought the business
over, I remembered that never once did she say that she would marry me. This, however, troubled
me little, since in such matters it is what women do that weighs, not what they say. For the
rest I was mad with love of her, also both then and as the days went by, more and more did
she seem to be travelling on this same road of Love. If not, indeed she acted well.

Within a month we were wed on a certain October day in the church of St. Margaret's at Westminster.
Once it was agreed all desired to push on this marriage, and not least Blanche herself. Sir
Robert Aleys said that he wished to be gone from London to his estates in Sussex, having had
enough of the Court and its ways, desiring there to live quietly till the end; I, being so
much in love, was on fire for my bride, and Blanche herself vowed that she was eager to become
my wife, saying that our courtship, which began on Hastings Hill, had lasted long enough. For
the rest, there was nothing to cause delay. I cancelled Sir Robert's debt to me and signed
a deed in favour of his daughter and her offspring, whereof I gave a copy to his lawyer and
there was nought else to be done except to prepare my house for her which, with money at command,
was easy.

No great business was made of this marriage, since neither his kin nor Sir Robert himself wished
to noise it about that his only child, the last of his House, was taking a merchant for her
husband to save her and him from wreck. Nor did I, the merchant, wish to provoke talk amongst
those of my own station, especially as it was known that I had advanced moneys to these fine
folks of the Court. So it came about that few were asked to the ceremony that was fixed for
an early hour, and of these not many came, because on that day, although it was but October,
a great gale with storms of rain began to blow, the greatest indeed that I had known in my life.

Thus it chanced that we were wed in an almost empty church while the fierce wind, thundering
against the windows, overcame the feeble voice of the old priest, so that he looked like one
acting in a show without words. The darkness caused by the thick rain was so deep, also, that
scarce could I see my bride's lovely face or find the finger upon which I must set the ring.

At length it was done and we went down the aisle to find our horses whereon we must ride to
my house in Cheapside, where there was to be a feast for my dependents and such of my few friends
as cared to come, among whom were not numbered any grand folk from Westminster. As we drew
near the church door I noted among those who were present those two gaudy ladies between whom
Deleroy had sat at that meal after the business of the loan was settled. Moreover, I heard
one of them say:

"What will Deleroy do when he comes back to find his darling gone?" and the other answer with
a high laugh:

"Seek another, doubtless, or borrow more money from the merchant, and----" Here I lost their
talk in the rush of the wind through the opened door.

In the porch was old Sir Robert Aleys.

"Mother of God!" he shouted, "may the rest of the lives of you two be smoother than your nuptials.
No Cheapside feast for me, I'm for home in such fiend's weather. Farewell, son Hubert, and
all joy to you. Farewell, Blanche. Learn to be obedient as a wife and keep your eyes for your
husband's face, that is my counsel to you. Till we meet again at Christmastide in Sussex, whither
I ride to-morrow, farewell to both of you."

Farewell, it was indeed, for never did either of us look on him again.

Wrapped close in our cloaks we battled through the storm and at length, somewhat breathless,
reached my house in the Cheap where the garlands of autumn flowers and greenery that I had
caused to be wreathed from posts before the door were all torn away by the gale. Here I welcomed
my wife as best I could, kissing her as she crossed the threshold and saying certain sweet
words that I had prepared, to which she smiled an answer. Then the women took her to her chamber
to make herself ready and afterwards came the feast, which was sumptuous of its sort, though
the evil weather kept some of the guests away.

Scarcely had it begun when Kari, who of late had been sad-faced and brooding, and who did not
eat with us, entered and whispered to me that my Master of Lading from the docks prayed to
see me at once on a matter which would brook no delay. Making excuse to Blanche and the company,
I went out to see him in the shop and found the man much disturbed. It seemed that a certain
vessel of mine that I had rechristened Blanche in honour of my wife, which lay in the stream
ready to sail, was in great danger because of the tempest. Indeed, she was dragging at her
anchor, and it was feared that unless more anchors could be let down she would come ashore
and be wrecked against the jetty-heads or otherwise. The reason why this had not been done,
was that only the master and one sailor were on board the vessel; the rest were feasting ashore
in honour of my marriage, and refused to row out to her, saying that the boat would be swamped
in the gale.

Now this ship, although not very large, was the best and staunchest that I owned, being almost
new; moreover, the cargo on board of her, laden for the Mediterranean, was of great value,
so great indeed that its loss would have been very grievous to me. Therefore, it was plain
that I must see to the matter without delay, since from my servant's account there was no hope
that these rebellious sailors would listen to any lesser man than myself. So, if I would save
the ship and her cargo, I must ride for the docks at once.

Going back to the eating-chamber, in a few words I told my wife and the guests how the matter
stood, praying the oldest man among the latter to take my place by the bride, which he did
unwillingly, muttering that this was an unlucky marriage feast.

Then it was that Blanche rose, beseeching me earnestly and almost with tears that I would take
her with me to the docks. I laughed at her, as did the company, but still she besought with
much persistence, till I began to believe that she must be afraid of something, though the
others cried that it was but love and fear lest I should come to harm.

In the end I made her drink a cup of wine with me, but her hand shook so much that she spilled
the cup and the rich red wine ran down her breast, staining the whiteness of her robe, whereat
some women among the company murmured, thinking it a bad omen. At length with a kiss I tore
myself away, for I could bide no longer and the horses were waiting presently. So I was riding
for the docks as fast as the storm would suffer, with tiles from the roofs, and when we were
clear of these the torn-off limbs of trees hurtling round me. Kari, I should say, would have
accompanied me, but I took a serving-man, bidding Kari bide where he was in the house in case
he might be of service.

At last we came safely to the docks where I found all as my cargo-master had described. The
ship Blanche was in great peril and dragging every minute towards a pierhead which, if she
struck, would stave her in and make an end of her. The men, too, were still feasting in the
inn with their wharfside trollops, and some of them half drunk. At her, her have idea with him know

Also, leaving Kari to hold the tiller, I took off my armour and in place of it clothed myself
in the rough sea garments that lay about with tall greased boots, and then sent him to do likewise.

Soon we lost sight of land and were climbing the great ocean billows, whose foamy crests rolled
and spurted wherever the eye fell. We could set no course but must go where the gale drove
us, away, away we knew not whither. As I have said, the Blanche was new and strong and the
best ship that ever I had sailed in upon a heavy sea. Moreover, her hatches were closed down,
for this the sailors had done after we weighed, so she rode the waters like a duck, taking
no harm. Oh! well it was for me that from my childhood I had had to do with ships and the sailing
of them, and flying from the following waves thus was able to steer and keep the Blanche's
poop right in the wind, which seemed to blow first from one quarter and then from that.

Now over my memory of these events there comes a great confusion and sense of amazement. All
became fragmentary and disjointed, separated also by what seemed to be considerable periods
of time--days or weeks perhaps. There was a sense of endless roaring seas before which the
ship fled on and on, driven by a screaming gale that I noted dimly seemed to blow first from
the northwest and then steadily from the east.

I see myself, very distinctly, lashing the tiller to iron rings that were screwed in the deck
beams, and know that I did this because I was too weak to hold it any longer and desired to
set it so that the Blanche should continue to drive straight before the gale. I see myself
lying in the deck-house of which I have spoken, while Kari fed me with food and water and sometimes
thrust into my mouth little pellets of I knew not what, which he took from the leathern bag
he wore about him. I remembered that bag. It had been on his person when I rescued him at the
quay, for I had seen it first as he washed himself afterwards, half full of something, and
wondered what it contained. Later, I had seen it in his hand again when we left my house after
the death of Blanche. I noted that whenever he gave me one of these pellets I seemed to grow
strong for a while, and then to fall into sleep, deep and prolonged.

After more days--or weeks, I began to behold marvels and to hear strange voices. I thought
that I was talking with my mother and with my patron, St. Hubert; also that Blanche came to
me and explained everything, showing how little she had been to blame for all that had happened
to me and her. These things made me certain that I was dead and I was glad to be dead, since
now I knew there would be no more pain or strivings; that the endeavours which make up life
from hour to hour had ceased and that rest was won. Only then appeared my uncle, John Grimmer,
who kept quoting his favourite text at me--"Vanity of vanities. All is vanity," he said, adding:
"Did I not tell you that it was thus years ago? Now you have learned it for yourself. Only,
Nephew Hubert, don't think that you have finished with vanities yet, as I have, for I say that
there are plenty more to come for you."

Thus he seemed to talk on about this and other matters, such as what would happen to his wealth
and whether the hospitals would be quick to seize the lands to which he had given it the reversion,
till I grew quite tired of him and wished that he would go away.

Then at length there was a great crash that I think disturbed him, for he did go, saying that
it was only another "vanity," after which I seemed to fall asleep for weeks and weeks.

I woke up again for a warmth and brightness on my face caused me to open my eyes. I lifted
my hand to shield them from the brightness and noted with a kind of wonder that it was so thin
that the light shone through it as it does through parchment, and that the bones were visible
beneath the skin. I let it fall from weakness, and it dropped on to hair which I knew must
be that of a beard, which set me wondering, for it had been my fashion to go clean-shaven.
How, then, did I come by a beard? I looked about me and saw that I was lying on the deck of
a ship, yes, of the Blanche itself, for I knew the shape of her stern, also certain knots in
one of the uprights of the deck-house that formed a rude resemblance to a human face. Nothing
of this deck-house was left now, except the corner posts between which I lay, and to the tops
of these was lashed a piece of canvas as though to keep off the sun and the weather.

With difficulty I lifted my head a little and looked about me. The bulwarks of the ship had
gone, but some of the uprights to which the planks had been nailed remained, and between them
I perceived tall-stemmed trees with tufts of great leaves at the top of them, which trees seemed
to be within a few yards of me. Bright-winged birds flew about them and in their crowns I saw
apes such as the sailors used to bring home from Barbary. It would seem, then, that I must
be in a river (in fact, it was a little bay or creek, on either side of which these trees appeared).

Noting these and the creeping plants with beautiful flowers, such as I had never seen, that
climbed up them, and the sweet scents that floated on the air, and the clear light, now I grew
sure that I was dead and had reached Paradise. Only then how came it that I still lay on the
ship, for never had I heard that such things also went to Paradise? Nay, I must dream; it was
nothing but a dream that I wished were true, remembering as I did the terrors of that gale-tossed
sea. Or, if I did not dream, then I was in some new world.

While I mused thus I heard a sound of soft footsteps and presently saw a figure bending over
me. It was Kari, very thin and hollow-eyed, much, indeed, as he had been when I found him on
the quay in London, but still Kari without doubt. He looked at me in his grave fashion, then
said softly:

"Master awake?"

"Yes, Kari," I said, "but tell me, where am I?"

He did not answer at once but went away and returned presently with a bowl from which he bade
me drink, holding it to my lips. I did so, swallowing what seemed to be broth though I thought
it strangely flavoured, after which I felt much stronger, for whatever was in that broth ran
through my veins like wine. At last he spoke in his queer English.

"Master," he said, "when we still in Thames River, you ask me whether we should run ashore
into the hands of the hunters who try to catch us, or sail on. I answer, 'You have God and
I have God and better fall into hands of gods than into hands of men.' So we sail on into the
big storm. For long we sail, and though once it turn, always the great wind blew, behind us.
You grow weak and your mind leave you, but I keep you alive with medicine that I have and for
many days I stay awake and steer. Then at last my mind leave me, too, and I know no more. Three
days ago I wake up and find the ship in this place. Then I eat more medicine and get strength,
also food from people on the shore who think us gods. That all the story, except that you live,
not die. Your God and my God bring us here safe."

"Yes, Kari, but where are we?"

"Master, I think in that country from which I come; not in my own land which is still far away,
but still in that country. You remember," he added with a flash of his dark eyes, "I always
say that you and I go there together one day."

"But what is the country, Kari?"

"Master, not know its name. It big and have many names, but you first white man who ever come
here, that why people think you God. Now you go sleep again; to-morrow we talk."

I shut my eyes, being so very tired, and as I learned afterwards, slept for twelve hours or
more, to awake on the morning of the following day, feeling wonderfully stronger and able to
eat with appetite. Also Kari brought me water and washed me, and clean clothes which he had
found in the ship that I put on.

Thus it went on for a long while and day by day I recovered strength till at length I was almost
as I had been when I married Blanche Aleys in the church of St. Margaret at Westminster. Only
now sorrow had changed me within and without my face had grown more serious, while to it hung
a short yellow beard which, when I looked at my reflection, seemed to become me well enough.
That beard puzzled me much, since such are not grown in a day, although it is true that as
yet it was not over-long. Weeks must have passed since it began to sprout upon my chin and
as we had been but three days in this place when I woke up, those weeks without doubt were
spent upon the sea.

Whither, then, had we come? Driving all the while before a great gale, that for most of our
voyage had blown from the east, as, if Kari were right, we had done, this country must be very
far away from England. That it was so, indeed there could be no doubt, since here everything
was different. For example, having been a mariner from my childhood, I had been taught and
observed something of the stars, and noted that the constellations had changed their places
in the heavens, also that some with which I was familiar were missing, while other new ones
had appeared. Further, the heat was great and constant, even at night being more than that
of our hottest summer day, and the air was full of stinging insects, which at first troubled
me much, though afterwards I grew hardened to them. In short, everything was changed, and I
was indeed in a new world that was not told of in Europe, but what world? What world? At least
the sea joined it to the old, for beneath me was still the Blanche, which timber by timber
I had seen built up upon the shores of Thames from oaks cut in my own woods.

As soon as I was strong enough, I went over the ship, or what was left of her. It was a marvel
that she had floated for so long, since her hull was shattered. Indeed, I do not think she
could have done so, save for the fine wool that was packed into the lower part of her, which
wool seemed to have swollen when it grew wet and to have kept the water out. For the rest she
was but a hulk, since both her masts were gone, and much of the deck with them. Still she had
kept afloat and driving into this creek, had beached herself upon the mud as though it were
the harbour that she sought.

How had we lived through such a journey? The answer seemed to be, after we were too weak to
find or take food, by means of the drug that Kari cherished in his skin bag, and water of which
there was plenty left at hand in barrels, since the Blanche had been provisioned for a long
voyage to Italy and farther. At least we had lived for weeks, and weeks, being still young
and very strong, and not having been called upon to suffer great cold, since it would appear
that although the gale continued after the first few days of our flight before it, the weather
had turned warm.

During this time of my recovery, every morning Kari would go ashore, which he did by means
of planks set upon the mud, since we were within a few feet of the bank of the creek into which
a streamlet ran. Later he would return, bringing with him fish and wildfowl, and corn of a
sort that I did not know, for its grains were a dozen times the size of wheat, flat-sided,
and if ripe, of a yellow colour, which he said he had purchased from those who dwelt upon the
land. On this good food I feasted, washing it down with ale and wine from the ship's stores;
indeed never before did I eat so much, not even when I was a boy.

At length, one morning Kari made me put on my armour, the same which I had taken from the French
knight, and fled in from London, that he had burnished till it shone like silver, and seat
myself in a chair upon what remained of the poop of the ship. When I asked him why, he answered
in order that he might show me to the inhabitants of that land. In this chair he bade me sit
and wait, holding the shield upon my arm and the bare sword in my right hand.

As I had come to know that Kari never did anything without a reason and remembered that I was
in a strange country where, lacking him, I should not have lived or could continue to do so,
I fell into his humour. Moreover, I promised that I would remain still and neither speak, nor
smile, nor rise from my chair unless he bade me. So there I sat glittering in the hot sunshine
which burned me through the armour.

Then Kari went ashore and was absent for some time. At length among the trees and undergrowth
I heard the sound of people talking in a strange tongue. Presently they appeared on the bank
of the creek, a great number of them, very curious people, brown-skinned with long, lank black
hair and large eyes, but not over-tall in stature; men, women and children together.

Among them were some who wore white robes whom I took to be their gentlefolk, but the most
of them had only cloths or girdles about their middles. Leading the throng was Kari, who, as
it appeared from the bushes, waved his hand and pointed me out seated in the shining armour
on the ship, the visor up to show my face and the long sword in my hand. They stared, then,
with a low, sighing exclamation, one and all fell upon their faces and rubbed their brows upon
the ground.

As they lay there Kari addressed them, waving his arms and pointing towards me from time to
time. Afterwards I learned that he was telling them I was a god, for which lie may his soul
be forgiven.

The end of it was that he bade them rise and led certain of them who wore the white robes across
the planks to the ship. Here, while they hung back, he advanced towards me, bowing and kissing
the air till he drew near, then he went upon his knees and laid his hands upon my steel-clad
feet. More, from the bosom of his robe he drew out flowers which he placed upon my knees as
though in offering.

"Now, Master," he whispered to me, "rise and wave your sword and shout aloud, to show that
you are alive and not an image."

So up I sprang, circling Wave-Flame about my head and roaring like any bull of Bashan, for
my voice was always loud and carried far. When they saw the bright sword whirling through the
air and heard these bellowings, uttering cries of fear, those poor folk fled. Indeed most of
them fell from the plank into the mud, where one stuck fast and was like to drown, had not
Kari rescued him, which his brethren were in too great haste to do.

After they had gone Kari came and said that everything went well and that henceforward I was
not a man but the Spirit of the Sea come to earth, such a spirit as had never been dreamed
of even by the wizards.

Thus then did Hubert of Hastings become a god among those simple people, who had never before
so much as heard of a white man, or seen armour or a sword of steel.

CHAPTER II

THE ROCKY ISLE

For another week or more I remained upon the Blanche waiting till my full strength returned,
also because Kari said I must do so. When I asked him why, he replied for the reason that he
wished news of my coming to spread far and wide throughout the land from one tribe to another,
which it would do with great swiftness, flying, as he put it, like a bird. Meanwhile, every
day I sat upon the poop in the armour for an hour or more, and both these people and others
from afar came to look at me, bringing me presents in such quantity that we knew not what to
do with them. Indeed, they built an altar and sacrificed wild creatures to me, and birds, burning
them with fire. Both those that I had seen and the other folk from a long way off made this
offering.

At last one night, when, having eaten, Kari and I were seated together in the moonshine before
we slept, I turned on him suddenly, hoping thus to surprise the truth out of his secret heart,
and said:

"What is your plan, Kari? For, know, I weary of this life."

"I was waiting for the Master to ask that question," he replied with his gentle smile. (Again,
I give not the very words he spoke in his bad English, but the substance of them.) "Now will
the Master be pleased to listen? As I have told the Master, I believe that the gods, his God
and my God, have brought me back to that part of the world which is unknown to the Master,
where I was born. I believed this from the first hour that my eyes opened on it after our swoon,
for I knew the trees and the flowers and the smell of the earth, and saw that the stars in
the heavens stood where I used to see them. When I went ashore and mingled with the natives,
I discovered that this belief was right, since I could understand something of their talk and
they could understand something of mine. Moreover, among them was a man who came from far away,
who said that he had seen me in past years, wandering like one mad, only that this man whom
he had seen wore the image of a certain god about his neck, whose name was too high for him
to mention. Then I opened my robe and showed him that which I wear about my neck, and he fell
down and worshipped it, crying out that I was the very man."

"If so, it is marvellous," I said. "But what shall we do?"

"The Master can do one of two things. He can stop here, where these simple people will make
him their king and give him wives and all that he desires, and so live out his life, since
of return to the land whence he came there is no hope."

"And if there were I would not go," I interrupted.

"Or," went on Kari, "he can try to travel to my country. But that is very far away. Something
of the journey which I made when I was mad comes back and tells me that it is very, very far
away. First, yonder mountains must be crossed till another sea is reached, which is no great
journey, though rough. Then the coast of that sea must be followed southward, for I know not
how far, but, as I think, for months or years of journeying, till at length the country of
my people is reached. Moreover, that journeying is hard and terrible, since the road runs through
forests and deserts where dwell savage tribes and huge snakes and wild beasts, like those planted
on the flag of your country, and where famine and sicknesses are common. Therefore my counsel
to the Master is that he should leave it unattempted."

Now I thought awhile, and asked what he meant to do if I took this counsel of his. To which
he replied:

"I shall wait here awhile till I see the Master made a king among these people and established
in his rule. Then I shall start on that journey alone, hoping that what I could do when I was
mad I shall be able to do again when I am not mad."

"I thought it," I said. "But tell me, Kari, if we were to make this journey and perchance live
to reach your people, how would they welcome us?"

"I do not know, Master; but I think that of the master they would make a god, as will all the
other people of this country. Perhaps, too, they will sacrifice this god that his strength
and beauty may enter into them. As for me, some of them will try to kill me and others will
cling to me. Who will conquer I do not know, and to me it matters little. I go to take my own
and to be avenged, and if in seeking vengeance I die--well, I die in honour."

"I understand," I said. "And now, Kari, let us start as soon as possible before I become as
mad from staring at those trees and flowers and those big-eyed natives, that you say would
make me a king, as you tell me you were when you left your country. Whether we shall ever find
that country I cannot say. But at least we shall have done our best and, if we fail, shall
perish seeking, as in this way or in that it is the lot of all brave men to do."

"The Master has spoken," said Kari, even more quietly than usual, though as he spoke I saw
his dark eyes flash and a trembling as of joy run down his body. "Knowing all, he has made
his choice, and whatever happens, being what it is, he will not blame me. Yet because the Master
has thus chosen, I say this--that if we reach my country, and if, perchance, I become a king
there, even more than before I shall be the Master's servant."

"That is easy to promise now, Kari, but it will be time to talk of it when we do reach your
land," I said, laughing, and asked him when we were to start.

He replied not yet awhile, as he must make plans, and that in the meantime I must walk upon
the shore so that my legs might grow strong again. So there every day I walked in the cool
of the morning and in the evening, not going out of sight of the wreck. I went armed and carrying
my big bow, but saw no one, since the natives had been warned that I should walk and must not
be looked upon while I did so. Therefore, even when I passed through one of their villages
of huts built of mud and thatched with leaves, it seemed to be deserted.

Still, in the end the bow did not come amiss, for one evening, hearing a little noise in a
big tree under which I was about to pass that reminded me of the purring of a cat, I looked
up and saw a great beast of the tiger sort lying on the bough of the tree and watching me.
Then I drew the bow and sent an arrow through that beast, piercing it from side to side, and
down it came roaring and writhing, and biting at the arrow till it died.

After this I returned to the ship and told Kari what had happened. He said it was fortunate
I had killed the beast, which was of a very fierce kind, and if I had not seen it, would have
leapt on me as I passed under the tree. Also he sent natives to skin it who when they saw that
it was pierced through and through by the arrow, were amazed and thought me an even greater
god than before, their own bows being but feeble and their arrows tipped with bone.

Three days after the killing of this beast we started on our journey into a land unknown. For
a long while before Kari and I had been engaged in collecting all the knives we could find
in the ship, also arrows, nails, axes, tools of carpentering, clothes, and I know not what
else besides, which goods we tied up in bundles wrapped in sailcloth, each bundle weighing
from thirty to forty pounds, to serve as presents to natives or to trade away with them. When
I asked who would carry them, Kari answered that I should see. This I did at dawn on the following
morning when there arrived upon the shore a great number of men, quite a hundred indeed, who
brought with them two litters made of light wood jointed like reeds, only harder, in which
Kari said he and I were to be carried. Among these men he parcelled out the loads which they
were to bear upon their heads, and then said that it was time for us to start in the litters.

So we started, but first I went down into a cabin and kneeling on my knees, thanked God for
having brought me safe so far, and prayed Him and St. Hubert to protect me on my further wanderings,
and if I died, to receive my soul. This done I left the ship and while the natives bowed themselves
about me, entered my litter, which was comfortable enough, having grass mats to lie on and
other mats for curtains, very finely woven, so that they would turn even the heaviest rain.

Then away we went, eight men bearing the pole to which each litter was slung on their shoulders,
while others carried the bundles upon their heads. Our road ran through forest uphill, and
on the crest of the first hill I descended from the litter and looked back.

There in the creek below lay the wreck of the Blanche, now but a small black blot showing against
the water, and beyond it the great sea over which we had travelled. Yonder broken hulk was
the last link which bound me to my distant home thousands of miles across the ocean, that home,
which my heart told me I should never see again, for how could I win back from a land that
no white foot had ever trod?

On the deck of this ship Blanche herself had stood and smiled and talked, for once we visited
it together shortly before our marriage, and I remembered how I had kissed her in its cabin.
Now Blanche was dead by her own hand and I, the great London merchant, was an outcast among
savages in a country of which I did not even know the name, where everything was new and different.
And there the ship with her rich cargo, after bearing us so bravely through weeks of tempest,
must lie until she rotted in the sun and rain and never again would my eyes behold her. Oh!
then it was that a sense of all my misery and loneliness gripped my heart as it had not done
before since I rode away after killing Deleroy with the sword Wave-Flame, and I wondered why
I had been born, and almost hoped that soon I might die and go to seek the reason.

Back into the litter I crept and there hid my face and wept like a child. Truly I, the prosperous
merchant of London town who might have lived to become its mayor and magistrate and win nobility,
was now an outcast adventurer of the humblest. Well, so God had decreed, and there was no more
to say.

That night we encamped upon a hilltop past which rushed a river in the vale below and were
troubled with heat and insects that hummed and bit, for to these as yet I was not accustomed,
and ate of the food that we had brought with us, dried flesh and corn.

Next morning with the light we started on again, up and down mountains and through more forests,
following the course of the river and the shores of a lake. So it went on until on the third
evening from high land we saw the sea beneath us, a different sea from that which we had left,
for it seemed that we had been crossing an isthmus, not so wide but that if any had the skill,
a canal might be cut across it joining those two great seas.

Now it was that our real travels began, for here, after staring at the stars and brooding apart
for a long while, Kari turned southwards. With this I had nothing to do who did not greatly
care which way he turned. Nor did he speak to me of the matter, except to say that his god
and such memory as remained to him through his time of madness told him that the land of his
people lay towards the south, though very far away.

So southwards we went, following paths through the forests with the ocean on our right hand.
After a week of this wearisome marching we came to another tribe of natives of whose talk those
with us could understand enough to tell them our story. Indeed the rumour that a white god
had appeared in the land out of the sea had already reached them, and therefore they were prepared
to worship me. Here our people left us, saying that they dared not go further from their own
country.

The scene of the departure was strange, since every one of them came and rubbed his forehead
in the dust before me and then went away, walking backwards and bowing. Still their going did
not make a great difference to us, since the new tribe was much as the old one, though if anything,
rather less clothed and more dirty. Also it accepted me as a god without question and gave
us all the food we needed. Moreover, when we left their land men were provided to carry the
litters and the loads.

Thus, then, passing from tribe to tribe, we travelled on southward, ever southwards, finding
always that the rumour of the coming of "the god" had gone before us. So gentle were all these
people, that not once did we meet with any who tried to harm us or to steal our goods, or who
refused us the best of what they had. Our adventures, it is true, were many. Thus, twice we
came to tribes that were at war with other tribes, though on my appearance they laid down their
arms, at any rate, for a time, and bore our litters forward.

Again, sometimes we met tribes who were cannibals and then we suffered much from want of meat,
since we dared not touch their food unless it were grain. In the town of the first of these
cannibal people, being moved with fury, I killed a man whom I found about to murder a child
and eat her, sweeping off his head with my sword. For this deed I expected that they would
murder us, but they did not. They only shrugged their shoulders and saying that a god can do
as he pleases, took away the slain man and ate him.

Sometimes our road ran through terrible forests where the great trees shut out the light of
day, and a path must be hacked through the undergrowth. Sometimes it was haunted by tigers
or tree lions such as I have spoken of, against which we must watch continuously, especially
at night, keeping the brutes off by means of fires. Sometimes we were forced to wade great
rivers, or worse still, to walk over them on swaying bridges made of cables of twisted reeds
that until I grew accustomed to them caused my head to swim, though never did I permit myself
to show fear before the natives. Again, once we came to swampy lands that were full of snakes
which terrified me much, especially after I had seen some natives whom they bit, die within
a few minutes.

Other snakes there were also, as thick as a man's body, and four or five paces in length, which
lived in trees and killed their food by coiling round it and pressing it to death. These snakes,
it was said, would take men in this fashion, though I never saw one of them do so. At any rate,
they were terrible to look on, and reminded me of their forefather through whose mouth Satan
talked with Mother Eve in the Garden of Eden, and thus brought us all to woe.

Once, too, on the bank of a great river, I saw such a snake that at the sight of it my knees
knocked together. By St. Hubert, the beast was sixty feet or more in length; its head was of
the bigness of a barrel, and its skin was of all the colours of the rainbow. Moreover, it seemed
to hold me with its eyes, for till it slipped away into the river I could not move a foot.

Month after month we travelled thus, covering a matter of perhaps five miles a day, since sometimes
the country was open and we crossed it with speed. Yet although our dangers were so many, strangely
enough, during all this time, even in that heat neither of us fell sick, as I think because
of the herb which Kari carried in his bag, that I found was named Coca, whereof we obtained
more as we went and ate from time to time. Nor did we ever really suffer from starvation, since
when we were hungry we took more of this herb which supported us until we could find food.
These mercies I set down to the good offices of St. Hubert watching from Heaven over me, his
poor namesake and godson, though perhaps the skill and courage of Kari which provided against
everything had something to do with them.

At length, in the ninth month of our travelling, as Kari reckoned it by means of knots which
he tied on pieces of native string, for I had long lost count of time, we came to the borders
of a great desert that the natives said stretched southwards for a hundred leagues and more
and was without water. Moreover, to the east of this desert rose a chain of mountains bordered
by precipices up which no man could climb. Here, therefore, it seemed as though our journey
must end, since Kari had no knowledge of how he crossed or went round this desert in his madness
of bygone years, if indeed he ever travelled that road at all, a matter of which I was not certain.

For a week or more we remained among the tribe that lived in a beautiful watered valley upon
the borders of this desert, wondering what we should do. For my part I was by now so tired
of travelling upon an endless quest that I should have been glad to stay among that tribe,
a very gentle and friendly people, who like all the rest believed me to be a god, and make
my home there till I died. But this was not Kari's mind, which was set fiercely upon winning
back to his own country that he believed to lie towards the south.

Day by day we sat there regaining our strength upon the good food of that valley, and staring
first at the desert to the south, then at the precipices on our left hand, and lastly at the
ocean upon our right. Now this people, I should say, drew their wealth from the sea as well
as from the land, since they were great fishermen and went out upon it in rude boats or rafts
made of a wooden frame to which were lashed blown-up skins and bundles of dried reeds. Upon
these boats, frail as they seemed, such as further south were called balsas, they made considerable
journeys to distant islands where they caught vast quantities of fish, some of which they used
to manure their land. Moreover, besides the oars, they rigged a square cotton sail upon the
balsas which enabled them to run before the wind without labour, steering the craft by means
of a paddle at the stern.

While we were there I observed that on the springing up of a wind from the north, although
it was of no great strength, the balsas all came to shore and were drawn up out of reach of
the waves. When I inquired why through Kari, the answer given was because the fishing season
was over, since that wind from the north would blow for a long time without changing and those
who went out in it upon the sea might be driven southwards to return no more. They stated,
indeed, that often this had happened to venturesome men who had vanished away and been lost.

"If you wish to travel south, there is a way of doing so," I said to Kari.

At the time he made no answer, but on the following day asked me suddenly if I dared attempt
such a journey.

"Why not?" I answered. "It is as easy to die in the water as on land and I weary of journeying
through endless swamps and forests or of crossing torrents and climbing mountain ridges."

The end of it was that for a knife and a few nails Kari purchased the largest balsa that these
people had, provisioning it with as much dried fish, corn and water in earthenware jars as
it would carry together with ourselves, and such of our remaining goods as we wished to take
with us. Then we announced that I, the god who had come out of the sea, desired to return into
the sea with himself, my servant.

So on a certain fine morning when the wind was blowing steadily but not too strongly from the
north, we embarked upon that balsa while the simple savages made obeisance with wonder in their
eyes, hoisted the square canvas, and sailed away upon what I suppose was one of the maddest
voyages ever made by man.

Although it was so clumsy the balsa moved through the water at a good rate, covering quite
two leagues the hour, I should say, before that strong and steady wind. Soon the village that
we had left vanished; then the mountains behind it grew dim and in time vanished also, and
there remained nothing but the great wilderness upon our left and the vast sea around. Steering
clear of the land so as to avoid sunken rocks, we sailed on all that day and all the night
that followed, and when the light came again perceived that we were running past a coastline
that was backed by high mountains on some of which lay snow. By the second evening these mountains
had become tremendous, and between them I saw valleys down which ran streams of water.

Thus we went on for three days and nights, the wind from the north blowing all the while and
the balsa taking no hurt, by the end of which time I reckon that we had travelled as far along
the coast as we had done in six months when we journeyed over land, at which I rejoiced. Kari
rejoiced also, because he said that the shape and greatness of the mountains we were passing
reminded him of those of his own country, to which he believed that we were drawing near.

On the fourth morning, however, our troubles began, since the friendly wind from the north
grew steadily stronger, till at length it rose to a gale. Soon our little rag of canvas was
torn away, but still we rushed on before the following seas at a very great speed.

Now I thought of trying to make the land, but found that we could not do so with the oars,
because of the current that set out towards the ocean against which it was impossible to urge
our clumsy craft. Therefore we must content ourselves with trying to keep her head straight
with the steering oar, but even then we were often whirled round and round.

About two hours after noon the sky clouded over, and there burst upon us a great thunder-storm
with torrents of rain; also the wind grew stronger and stronger.

Now we could no longer steer or do anything except lie flat upon the bottom of the balsa, gripping
the cords with which it was tied together, to save ourselves from being washed overboard, since
often the foaming crests of the waves broke upon us. Indeed, it was marvellous that this frail
craft should hang together at all, but owing to the lightness of the reeds and the blown-up
skins that were tied in them, still she floated and, whirling round and round, sped upon her
southward path. Yet I knew that this could not endure for very long, and committed my soul
to God as well as I was able in my half-drowned state, wishing that my miseries were ended.

The darkness came down, but still the thunder roared and the lightning blazed, and by the flare
of it I caught sight of snow-capped mountains far away upon the coast, also of Kari clinging
to the reeds of the balsa at my side, and from time to time kissing the golden image of Pachacamac
which hung about his neck. Presently he set his lips against my ear and shouted:

"Be bold! Our gods are still with us in storm."

"Yes," I answered, "and soon we shall be with our gods--in peace."

After this I heard no more of him, and fell to thinking with such wits as were left to me of
how many perils we had passed since we saw the shores of Thames, and that it seemed sad that
all should have been for nothing, since it would have been better to die at the beginning than
now at the end, after so much misery. Then the glare of the lightning shone upon the handle
of the sword Wave-Flame, which was still strapped about me, and I remembered the rune written
upon it which my mother had rendered to me upon the morning of the fight against the Frenchmen.
How did it run?

It fitted well, though of the love I had known little and that most unhappy, and the battle
in which I must die was one with water. Also, I had conquered nothing who myself was conquered
by Fate. In short, the thing could be read two ways, like all prophecies, and only one line
of it was true beyond a doubt--namely, that Wave-Flame and I should sleep together.

Awhile later the lightning shone awesomely, like to the swords of a whole army of destroying
angels, so that the sky became alive with fire. In its light for an instant I saw ahead of
us great breakers, and beyond them what looked like a dark mass of land. Now we were in them,
for the first of those hungry, curling waves got a hold of the balsa and tossed it up dizzily,
then flung it down into a deep valley of water. Another came and another, till my senses reeled
and went. I cried to St. Hubert, but he was a land saint and could not help me; so I cried
to Another greater than he.

My last vision was of myself riding a huge breaker as though it were a horse. Then there came
a crash and darkness.

Lo! it seemed to me as though one were calling me back from the depths of sleep. With trouble
I opened my eyes only to shut them again because of the glare of the light. Then after a while
I sat up, which gave me pain, for I felt as if I had been beaten all over, and looked once
more. Above me shone the sun in a sky of deepest blue; before me was the sea almost calm, while
around were rocks and sand, among which crawled great reptiles that I knew for turtles, as
I had seen many of them in our wanderings. Moreover, kneeling at my side, with the sword that
he had taken from the body of Deleroy still strapped about him, was Kari, who bled from some
wound and was almost white with encrusted salt, but otherwise seemed unharmed. I stared at
him, unable to open my mouth from amazement, so it was he who spoke the first, saying, in a
voice that had a note of triumph in it:

"Did I not tell you that the gods were with us? Where is your faith, O White Man! Look! They
have brought me back to the land of which I am Prince."

Now there was that in Kari's tone which in my weak state angered me. Why did he scold me about
faith? Why did he address me as "White Man" instead of "Master"? Was it because he had reached
a country where he was great and I was nothing? I supposed so, and answered;

"And are these your subjects, O noble Kari?" and I pointed to the crawling turtles. "And is
this the rich and wondrous land where gold and silver are as mud?" and I pointed to the barren
rocks and sand around.

He smiled at my jest, and answered more humbly:

"Nay, Master, yonder is my land."

Then I looked, following his glance, and saw many leagues way across the water two snowclad
peaks rising above a bank of clouds.

"I know those mountains," he went on; "without doubt they are one of the gateways of my land."

"Then we might as well be in London for all the hope we have of passing that gate, Kari. But
tell me what has chanced."

"This, I think. A very great wave caught us and threw us right over those rocks on to the shore.
Look--there is the balsa," and he pointed to a broken heap of reeds and pierced skins.

With his help I rose and went to it. Now none could know that it had been a boat. Still, the
balsa it was and nothing else, and tied in its tangled mass still remained those things which
we had brought with us, such as my black bow and armour, though all the jars were broken.

"It has borne us well, but will never bear us again," I said.

"That is so, Master. But if we were in my own country yonder I would set its fragments in a
case of gold and place them in the Temple of the Sun as a memorial."

Then we went to a pool of rainwater that lay in a hollow rock near by, and drank our fill,
for we were very thirsty. Also among the ruins of the balsa we found some of the dried fish
that was left to us, and having washed it, filled ourselves. After this we limped to the crest
of the land behind and perceived that we were on a little island, perhaps two hundred English
acres in extent, whereon nothing grew except some coarse grass. This island, however, was the
haunt of great numbers of seafowl which nested there, also of the turtles that I have mentioned,
and of certain beasts like seals or otters.

"At least we shall not starve," I said, "though in the dry season we may die of thirst."

Now there on that island we remained for four long months. For food we ate the turtles, which
we cooked over fires that Kari made by cunningly twirling a pointed piece of driftwood in the
hollow of another piece that he filled with the dust of dried grass. Had he lacked that knowledge
we must have starved or lived on raw flesh. As it was, we had plenty with this meat and that
of birds and their eggs, also of fish that we caught in the pools when the tide was down. From
the shells of the turtles, by the help of stones, we built us a kind of hut to keep off the
sun and the rain, which in that hot place was sufficient shelter; also, when the stench was
out of them, we used other shells in which to catch rainwater that we stored as best we could
against seasons of drought. Lastly, with my big bow which was saved with the armour, I shot
sea-otters, and from their pelts we made us garments after rubbing the skins with turtle fat
and handling them to make them soft.

Thus, then, we lived from moon to moon upon that desert place, till I thought I should go mad
with loneliness and despair, for no help came near us. There were the mountains of the mainland
far away, but between them and us stretched leagues of sea that we could not swim, nor had
we anything of which to make a boat.

"Here we must remain until we die!" at last I cried in my wretchedness.

"Nay," answered Kari, "our gods are still with us and will save us in their season."

This, indeed, they did in a strange fashion.

CHAPTER III

THE DAUGHTER OF THE MOON

For the fourth time since we were cast away on this island the huge full moon shone in a sky
of wondrous blue. Kari and I watched it rise between the two snow-clad peaks far away that
he had called a gateway to his land, which was so near to us and yet it would seem more distant
than Heaven itself. Heaven we might hope to reach upon the wings of spirit when we died, but
to that country how could we come?

We watched that great moon climb higher and higher up a ladder of little bar-like clouds, till
wearying we let our eyes fall upon the glittering pathway which its light made upon the bosom
of the placid sea. Suddenly Kari stared and stared.

"What is it?" I asked idly.

"I thought I saw something yonder far away where Quilla's footsteps make the waters bright,"
he said, speaking in his own language in which now we often talked together.

"Quilla's?" I exclaimed. "Oh! I forgot: that is the lady moon's name in your tongue, is it
not? Well, come, Quilla, and I will wed and worship you, as 'tis said the ancients did, and
never turn to look upon another, be she woman, or goddess, or both. Only come and take me from
this accursed isle and in payment I'll die for you, if need be, when first I've taught you
how to love as star or woman never loved before."

"Hush!" said Kari in a grave voice, when he had listened to this mad stuff that burst through
my lips from the spring of a mind distraught by misery and despair.

"Why should I hush?" I asked. "Is it not pleasant to think of the moon wearing a lovely woman's
shape and descending to give a lonely mortal love and comfort?"

"Because, Master, to me and my people the moon is a goddess who hears prayer and answers it.
Suppose, then, that she heard you and answered you and came to you and claimed your love, what
then?"

"Why, then, friend Kari," I raved on, "then I should welcome her, for love goes a begging,
ready as ripe fruit to be plucked by the first hand if it be fair enough, ready to melt beneath
the first lips if they be warm enough. 'Tis said that it is the man who loves and the woman
who accepts the love. But that is not true. It is the man, Kari, who waits to be loved and
pays back just as much as is given to him, and no more, like an honest merchant; for if he
does otherwise, then he suffers for it, as I have learned. Therefore, come, Quilla, and love
as a Celestial can and I swear that step by step I'll keep pace with you in flesh and spirit
through Heaven, or through Hell, since love I must have, or death."

"I pray you, talk not so," said Kari again, in a frightened voice, "since those words of yours
come from the heart and will be heard. The goddess is a woman, too, and what woman will turn
from such a bait?"

"Let her take it, then. Why not?"

"Because, O friend, because Quilla is wed to Yuti; the Moon is the Sun's wife, and if the Sun
grows jealous what will happen to the man who has robbed the greatest of the world's gods?"

"I do not know and I do not care. If Quilla would but come and love me, I'd take my chance
of Yuti whom as a Christian I defy."

Kari shuddered at this blasphemy, then having once more scanned that silver pathway on the
waters, but without avail for the great fish or drifting tree or whatever he had seen, was
gone, prayed after his fashion at night, to Pachacamac, Spirit of the Universe, or to the Sun
his servant, god of the world, I know not which, and rolling himself in his rug of skins, crept
into our little hut to sleep.

But as yet I did not sleep, for though Kari hated both, this talk of love and women had stirred
my blood and made me wakeful. So I took a rough comb that I had fashioned from the shell of
a turtle, and dragged it through my long fair beard, which, growing fast, now hung down far
upon my breast, and through the curling hair that lay upon my shoulders, for I had become as
other wild men are, and sang to myself there by the little fire which we kept burning day and
night and tried to think of happy things that never should I know again.

At length the fit passed and I grew weary and laid myself down by the fire, for the night being
so fine and warm I would not go into the hut, and there sleep found me.

I dreamed in my sleep. I dreamed that a very beautiful woman who wore upon her naked breast
the emblem of the moon fashioned in crystal, stood over me, looking down upon me with large
dark eyes. And as she looked she sighed. Thrice she sighed, each time more deeply than the
last. Then she knelt down by me--or so it seemed in my dream, and laid a tress of her long
dark hair against my yellow locks, as though she would match them together. She did more, indeed--in
my dream--for lifting that tress of fragrant hair, she let it fall like thistledown across
my face and mouth, and then kissed the hair, for I felt her breath reach me through its strands.

The dream ended thus, though I wished very much that it would go on, and I felt as though it
had gone away as such visions do. Awhile later, as I suppose, I awoke quite suddenly, and opened
my eyes. There, near to me, glittering in the full light of the brilliant moon, stood the woman
of my dream, only now her naked breast was covered with a splendid cloak broidered with silver,
and on her dark locks was a feathered headdress in front of which rose the crescent of the
moon, likewise fashioned in silver. Also in her hand she held a little silver spear.

I stared at her, for move I could not. Then remembering my crazy talk with Kari, uttered one
word, only one. It was--Quilla.

She bowed her head and answered in a voice soft as the murmur of the wind through rushes, speaking
in the rich language called Quichua that Kari had taught me. In this tongue, as I have told,
we talked together for practice during our journeys and on the island. So that now I knew it well.

"So indeed am I named after my mother, the 'Moon,'" she said. "But how did you know it, O Wanderer,
whose skin is white as the foam of the sea and whose hair is yellow as the fine gold in the
temples?"

"I think you must have told me when you knelt over me just now," I said.

I saw the red blood run to her brow, but she only shook her head, and answered:

"Nay, my mother, the Moon, must have told you; or perchance you learned it in the spirit. At
least, Quilla am I named and you called me aright."

Now I stood up and stared at her, overcome by the strangeness of the business, and she stared
at me. A marvellously beautiful woman she was in her dazzling robe and headdress, and lighter
coloured than any native I had seen, almost white, indeed, in the moonlight save for the copper
tinge that marked her race; tall, too, yet not over-tall; slim and straight as an arrow, but
high-breasted and round-limbed, and with a wild grace in her movements like to that of a hawk
upon the wing. Also to my fancy in her face there was something more than common youthful beauty,
something spiritual, such as great artists show upon the carven countenances of saints.

Indeed she might well have been one whose human blood was mixed with some other alien strain--as
she had called herself, a daughter of the Moon.

A question rose to my lips and burst from them; it was:

"Tell me, O Quilla, are you wife or maid?"

"Maid am I," she answered, "yet one who is promised as a wife," and she sighed, then went on
quickly as though this matter were something of which she did not wish to talk, "And tell me,
O Wanderer, are you god or man?"

Now I grew cunning and answered,

"I am a Son of the Sea as you are a Daughter of the Moon."

She turned her head and glanced at the radiance which lay upon the face of the deep, then said
as though to herself:

"The moon shines upon the sea and the sea mirrors back the moon, yet they are far apart and
never may draw near."

"Not so, O Quilla. Out of the sea does the moon rise and, her course run, into the sea's white
arms she sinks to sleep at last."

Again the red blood ran to her brow and her great eyes fell, those eyes of which never before
had I seen the like.

"It seems that they speak our tongue in the sea, and prettily," she murmured, adding, "But
is it not from and into Heaven that the Moon rises and departs?"

At that moment to my grief our talk came to an end, for out of the hut crept Kari. He rose
to his feet and stood there as ever calm and dignified, looking first at Quilla and then at me.

"What did I tell you, Master?" he said in English. "Did I not say that prayers such as yours
are answered? Lo! here is that Child of the Moon for whom you sought, clothed in beauty and
bringing her gifts of love and woe."

"Yes," I exclaimed, "and I am glad that she is here. For the rest, were she but mine, I think
I should not grudge her price whate'er it be."

Quilla looked at Kari frowning over the spear that when he appeared she had lifted, as though
to defend herself, which in my case she had not thought needful.

"So the sea breeds men of my own race also," she said, addressing him. "Tell me, O Stranger,
how did you and yonder white god come to this isle?"

"Riding on the ocean billows, riding for thousands of leagues," he answered. "And you, O Lady,
how did you come to this isle?"

"Riding on the moonbeams," she replied, smiling, "I, the daughter of the Moon, who am named
Moon and wear her symbol on my brow."

"Did I not tell you so?" exclaimed Kari to me with a gloomy air.

Then Quilla went on:

"Strangers, I was out fishing with two of my maidens and we had drifted far from land. As the
sun sank I caught sight of the smoke of your fire, and having been told that this isle was
desert, my heart drew me to discover who had lit it. So, though my maidens were afraid, hither
I sailed and paddled, and the rest you know. Hearken! I will declare myself. I am the only
child of Huaracha, King of the People of the Chancas, born of his wife, a princess of the Inca
blood who now has been gathered to her Father, the Sun. I am here on a visit to my mother's
kinsman, Quismancu, the Chief of the Yuncas of the Coastlands, to whom my father, the King,
has sent an embassy on matters of which I know nothing. Behind yonder rock is my balsa and
with it are the two maidens. Say, is it your wish to bide here upon this isle, or to return
into the sea, or to accompany me back to the town of Quismancu? If so, we must sail ere the
weather breaks, lest we should be drowned."

"Certainly it is my wish to accompany you, Lady, though a god of the sea cannot be drowned,"
I said quickly before Kari could speak. Indeed, he did not speak at all, he only shrugged his
shoulders and sighed, like one who accepts some evil gift from Fate because he must.

"So be it!" exclaimed Quilla. "Now I go to make ready the balsa and to warn the maidens lest
they be frightened. When you are prepared you will find us yonder behind the rock."

Then she bowed in a stately fashion an departed, walking with the proud, light step of a deer.

From our little hut I took out my armour and with Kari's help, put it on, because he declared
that thus it would be more easily carried, though I think he had other reasons in his mind.

"Yes," I answered, "unless the balsa oversets, when I shall find mail hard to swim in."

"The balsa will not overset, sailing beneath the moon with that Moon-lady for a pilot," he
replied heavily. "Had the sun been up, it might have been different. Moreover, the path into
a net is always wide and easy."

"What net?" I asked.

"One that is woven of women's hair, I think. Already, if I mistake not, such a net has been
about your throat, Master, and next time it will stay there. Hearken now to me. The gods thrust
us into high matters. The Yuncas of whose chief this lady is a guest are a great people whom
my people have conquered in war, but who wait the opportunity to rebel, if they have not already
done so. The Chancas, of those king she is the daughter, are a still greater people who for
years have threatened war upon my people."

"Well, what of it, Kari? With such questions this lady will have nothing to do."

"I think she has much to do with them. I think that she knows more than she seems to know,
and that she is an envoy from the Chancas to the Yuncas. To whom is she affianced, I wonder?
Some Great One, doubtless. Well, we shall learn in time; and meanwhile, I pray you, Master,
remember that she says she is affianced, and that in this land men are very jealous even of
a white god who rises from the sea."

"Of course I shall remember," I answered sharply. "Have I not had enough of women who are affianced?"

"By your prayer of the moon this night, which the moon answered so well and quickly, one might
think not. Also this daughter of hers is fair, and perchance when she gave her hand she kept
her heart. Listen again, Master. Of me and of whom I am, say nothing, save that you found me
on this island where I dwelt a hermit when you rose from the sea. As for my name, why, it is
Zapana. Remember that if you breathe my rank and history, however much sweet lips may try to
cozen them out of you, you bring me to my death, who now do not wish to die, having a vengeance
to accomplish and a throne to win. Therefore treat me as a dog, as one of no account, and be
silent even in your sleep."

"I will remember, Kari."

"That is not enough--swear it."

"Good. I swear it--by the moon."

"Nay, not by the moon, for the moon is woman and changes. Swear it by this," and from beneath
his skin robe he drew out the golden image of Pachacamac. "Swear it by the Spirit of the Universe,
of whom Sun and Moon and Stars are but servants, the Spirit whom all men worship in this shape
or in that."

So to please him I laid my hand upon the golden symbol and swore. Then, very hurriedly, we
made up a tale of how, clad in my armour, I had risen from the sea and found him on the island,
and how knowing me for a white god who once in ages past had visited that land and who, as
prophecy foretold, should return to it in days to come, he had worshipped me and become my slave.

This done we went down to the rock, Kari walking after me and bearing all our small possessions
and with them Deleroy's sword. Passing round the rock we saw the balsa drawn up to the sand,
and by it the lady Quilla, who now had put off her fine robes and again was attired as a fishing-girl
as I had seen her in my dream, and with her two tall girls in the same scanty garments. When
these saw me in the glittering armour, which in our long idle hours we had polished till it
shone like silver, with the shield upon my arm and the casque upon my head and the great sword
girded about my middle and the black bow in my hand, they screamed with fear and fell upon
their faces, while even Quilla started back and glanced towards the boat.

"Fear not," I said. "The gods are kind to those who do them service, though to those who would
harm them they are terrible."

Kari also went to them and whispered in their ears what tale I know not. In the end they rose
trembling, and having motioned to me to be seated in it, with the help of Kari pushed the balsa,
which I noted with joy was large and well made, down into the sea. Then one by one they climbed
in, Quilla taking the steering-oar, while Kari and the two maidens hoisted the little sail
and paddled till we were clear of the island, where the gentle wind caught the balsa. Then
they shipped the paddles, and although full laden, we sailed quietly towards the mainland.

Now I was at the bow of the balsa and Quilla was at its stern, and between us were the others,
so that during all that long night's journey I had no speech with her and must content myself
with gazing over my shoulder at her beauty as best I could, which was not well, because of
Kari, who ever seemed to come between my eyes and hers.

Thus the long hours went by till at length when we were near the land the moon sank, and we
sailed on through the twilight. Then came the dawn, and there in front of us we saw the lovely
strand green with palms within a ring of snow-clad mountains, two of them the great peaks that
we had seen from our isle.

On the shore was a city of white, flat-roofed houses, and rising above it, perchance the half
of a mile from the sea, a hill four or five hundred feet in height and terraced. On the top
of the hill stood a mighty building, painted red, that from the look of it I took to be one
of the churches of these people, in the centre of which gleamed great doors that, as I found
afterwards, were covered with plates of gold.

"Behold the temple of Pachacamac, Master," whispered Kari, bowing his head and kissing the
air in token of reverence.

By this time watchmen, who had been set there to search the sea or the boat of Quilla, had
noted our approach. They shouted and pointed to me who sat in the prow clad in my armour upon
which the sun glittered, then began to run to and fro as though in fear or excitement, so that
ere we reached the shore a great crowd had gathered. Meanwhile, Quilla had put on her silver-broidered
mantle and her head-dress of feathers, crowned with the crescent of the moon. As we touched
the beach she came forward, and for the first time during that night spoke to me saying:

"Remain here in the balsa, Lord, while I talk with these people, and when I summon you be pleased
to come. Fear not--none will harm you."

Then she sprang from the prow of the balsa to the shore, followed by her two maidens, who dragged
it further up the beach, and went forward to talk with certain white-robed men in the crowd.
For a long while she talked, turning now and again to point at me. At length these men, accompanied
by a number of others, ran forward. At first I thought they meant mischief and grasped my sword-hilt,
then, remembering what Quilla had said, remained seated and silent.

Indeed, there was no cause for fear, for when the white-robed chiefs or priests and their following
were close to me, suddenly they prostrated themselves and beat their heads upon the sand, from
which I learned that they, too, believed me to be a god. Thereon I bowed to them and, drawing
my sword--at the sight of which I saw them stare and shiver, for to these people steel was
unknown--held it straight up in front of me in my right hand, the shield with the cognizance
of the three arrows being on my left arm.

Now all the men rose, and some of them of the humbler sort, creeping to the balsa, suddenly
seized it and lifted it on to their shoulders, which, being but a light thing of reeds and
blown-out skins, they could do easily enough. Then, preceded by the chiefs, they advanced up
the beach into the town, I still remaining seated in the boat with Kari crouching behind me.
So strange was the business that almost I laughed aloud, wondering what those grave merchants
of the Cheap whom I had known in London would think if they could see me thus.

"Kari," I said, without turning my head, "what are they going to do with us? Set us in yonder
temple to be worshipped with nothing to eat?"

"I think not, Master," answered Kari, "since there the lady Quilla could not come to speak
with you if she would. I think that they will take you to the house of the king of this country
where, I understand, she is dwelling."

This, indeed, proved to be the case, for we were borne solemnly up the main street of the town,
that now was packed with thousands of people, some of whom threw flowers before the feet of
the bearers, bowing and staring till I thought that their eyes would fall out, to a large,
flat-roofed house set in a walled courtyard. Passing through the gates the bearers placed the
balsa on the ground and fell back. Then from out of the door of the house appeared Quilla,
accompanied by a tall, stately looking man who wore a fine robe, and a woman of middle age
also gorgeously apparelled.

"O Lord," said Quilla, bowing, "behold my kinsman the Caraca" (which is the name for a lesser
sort of king) "of the Yuncas, named Quismancu, and his wife, Mira."

"Hail, Lord Risen from the Sea!" cried Quismancu. "Hail, White God clothed in silver! Hail,
Hurachi!"

Why he called me "Hurachi" at the time I could not guess, but afterwards I learned that it
was because of the arrows painted on my shield, hurachi being their name for arrows. At any
rate, thenceforth by this name of Hurachi I was known throughout the land, though when addressed
for the most part I was called "Lord-from-the-Sea" or "God-of-the-Sea."

Then Quilla and the lady Mira came forward and, placing their hands beneath my elbows, assisted
me to climb out of that balsa, which I think was the strangest way that ever a shipwrecked
wanderer came to land.

They led me into a large room with a flat roof that was being hastily prepared for me by the
hanging of beautiful broideries on the walls, and sat me on a carven stool, where presently
Quilla and other ladies brought me food and a kind of intoxicating drink which they called
chicha, that after so many months of water drinking I found cheering and pleasant to the taste.
This food, I noted, was served to me on platters of gold and silver, and the cups also were
of gold strangely fashioned, by which I knew that I had come to a very rich land. Afterwards
I learned, however, that in it there was no money, all the gold and silver that it produced
being used for ornament or to decorate the temples and the palaces of the Incas, as they called
their kings, and other great lords.

CHAPTER IV

THE ORACLE OF RIMAC

In this town of Quismancu I remained for seven days, going abroad but little, for when I did
so the people pressed about me and stared me out of countenance. There was a garden at the
back of the hose surrounded by a wall built of mud bricks. Here for the most part I sat and
here the great ones of the place came to visit me, bringing me offerings of robes and golden
vessels and I know not what besides. To all of them I told the same story--or, rather, Kari
told it for me--namely, that I had risen out of the sea and found him a hermit, named Zapana,
on the desert island. What is more, they believed it and, indeed, it was true, for had I not
risen out of the sea?

From time to time Quilla came to see me also in this garden, bearing gifts of flowers, and
with her I talked alone. She would sit upon a low stool, considering me with her beautiful
eyes, as though she would search out my soul. One day she said to me:

"Tell me, Lord, are you a god or a man?"

"What is a god?" I asked.

"A god is that which is adored and loved."

"And is a man never adored and loved, Quilla? For instance, I understand that you are to be
married, and doubtless you adore and love him who will be your husband."

She shivered a little and answered:

"It is not so. I hate him."

"Then why are you going to marry him? Are you forced to do so, Quilla?"

"No, Lord. I marry him for my people's sake. He desires me for my inheritance and my beauty,
and by my beauty I may lead him down that road on which my people wish that he should go."

"An old story, Quilla, but will you be happy thus?"

"No, Lord, I shall be very unhappy. But what does it matter? I am only a woman, and such is
the lot of women."

"Women, like gods and men, are also sometimes loved and adored, Quilla."

She flushed at the words and answered:

"Ah! if that were so life might be different. But even if it were so and I found the man who
could love and adore even for a year, for me it is now too late. I am sworn away by an oath
that may not be broken, for to break it might bring death upon my people."

"To whom are you sworn?"

"To the Child of the Sun, no less a man; to the god who will be Inca of all this land."

"And what is this god like?"

"They say that he is huge and swarthy, with a large mouth, and I know that he has the heart
of a brute. He is cruel and false also, and he counts his women by the score. Yet his father,
the Inca, loves him more than any of his children, and ere long he will be king after him."

"And would you, who are sweet and lovely as the moon after which you are named, give yourself
body and soul to such a one?"

Again she flushed.

"Do my own ears hear the White-God-from-the-Sea call me sweet and lovely as the moon? If so,
I thank him, and pray him to remember that the perfect and lovely are always chosen to be the
sacrifice of gods."

"But, Quilla, the sacrifice may be all in vain. How long will you hold the fancy of this loose-living
prince?"

"Long enough to serve my purpose, Lord--or, at least," she added with flashing eyes, "long
enough to kill him if he will not go my country's road. Oh! ask me no more, for your words
stir something in my breast, a new spirit of which I never dreamed. Had I heard them but three
moons gone, it might have been otherwise. Why did you not appear sooner from the sea, my lord
Hurachi, be you god or man?"

Then, with something like a sob, she rose, made obeisance, and fled away.

That evening, when we were alone in my chamber where none could hear us, I told Kari that Quilla
was promised in marriage to a prince who would be Inca of all the land.

"Is it so?" said Kari. "Well, learn, Master, that this prince is my brother, he whom I hate,
he who has done me bitter wrong, he who stole away my wife and poisoned me. Urco is his name.
Does this lady Quilla love him?"

"I think not. I think that like you she hates him, yet will marry him for reasons of policy."

"Doubtless she hates him now, whatever she did a week ago," said Kari in a dry voice. "But
what fruit will this tree bear? Master, are you minded to come with me to-morrow to visit the
temple of Pachacamac in the inner sanctuary of which sits the god Rimac who speaks oracles?"

"For what purpose, Kari?" I answered moodily.

"That we may hear oracles, Master. I think that if you choose to go the lady Quilla would come
with us, since perhaps she would like also to hear oracles."

"I will go if it can be done in secret, say at night, for I weary of being stared at by these
people."

This I said because I desired to learn of the religion of this nation and to see new things.

"Perhaps it can be so ordered, Master. I will ask of the matter."

It seemed that Kari did ask, perhaps of the high priest of Pachacamac, for between all the
worshippers of this god there was a brotherhood; perhaps of the lord Quismancu, or perhaps
of Quilla herself--I do not know. At least, on this same day Quismancu inquired whether it
would please me to visit the temple that night, and so the matter was settled.

Accordingly, after the darkness had fallen, two litters were brought into which we entered,
Quilla and a waiting woman seating themselves in one of them and Kari and I in the other, for
Quismancu and his wife did not come--why I cannot say. Then, preceded by another litter in
which was a priest of the god, and surrounded by a guard of soldiers, through a rain-storm
we were borne up the hill--it was but a little way--to the temple.

Here, before the golden doors on which the lightning glimmered fitfully, we descended and were
led by white-robed men bearing lanterns, through various courts to the inner sanctuary of the
god, on the threshold of which I crossed myself, not loving the company of heathen idols. So
far as I could see by the lamplight it was a great and glorious place, and everywhere that
the eye fell was gold--places of gold on the walls, offerings of gold upon the floor, stars
of gold upon the roof. The strange thing about this holy place, however, was that it seemed
to be quite empty except for the aforesaid gold. There was neither altar nor image--nothing
but a lamp-lit void.

Here all prostrated themselves, save I alone, and prayed in silence. When they rose again,
in a whisper I asked of Kari where was the god. To which he answered: "Nowhere, yet everywhere."
This I thought a true saying, and indeed so solemn was that place that I felt as though I were
surrounded by that which is divine.

After a while the priests, who were gorgeously apparelled, led us across the sanctuary to a
door that opened upon some stairs. Down these stairs we went into a long passage that seemed
to run beneath the earth, for the air in it was heavy. When we had walked a hundred paces or
more in this narrow place, we came to other steps and another door, passing through which we
found ourselves in a second temple, smaller than that which we had visited, but like to it
rich with gold. In the centre of this temple sat the image of a man rudely fashioned of gold.

"Behold Rimac the Speaker!" whispered Kari.

"How can gold speak?" I asked.

Kari made no answer.

Presently the priests began to mutter prayers and incantations that I thought unholy, after
which they laid offerings of what looked like raw flesh set in cups of gold before the idol,
that I thought unholier still. Lastly they drew back and asked of what we would learn.

I made no answer who did not like the business. Nor did Kari say anything, but Quilla spoke
out boldly, saying that we would learn of the future and what would befall us.

Now there was a long silence, and I confess that fear got hold of me, for it seemed to me as
though spirits were moving in the air and through the darkness behind us--yes, as though I
could hear their whisperings and the rustle of their wings. Suddenly, at the end of this silence,
the golden image in front of us began to glow as though it were molten, and the emerald eyes
that were set in its head to sparkle terribly, which frightened me so much that had it not
been for shame's sake I would have run away, but because of this stood still and prayed to
St. Hubert to protect me from the devil and his works. Presently I prayed still harder, for
the image began to speak--yes, in a horrid, whistling voice it spoke, although no one was near
to it. These were the words it said:

"Who is this clad in silver whose skin is white and whose hair is yellow? Such an one I have
not seen for a thousand years, and such as he it is that shall possess themselves of the Land
of Tavantinsuyu, shall steal its wealth, shall slay its people, and shall cast down its gods.
But not yet, not yet! Therefore this is the command of Pachacamac, uttered by the voice of
Rimac the Speaker, that none do harm to or cross the will of this mighty seaborn lord, since
he shall be as a strong wall to many and his sword shall be red with the blood of the wicked."

The whistling voice ceased while the priests and all there stared at me, for they seemed to
think its words fateful. Then suddenly it began again:

"And who is this that came out of the sea with the Shining One, having wandered further than
any of his ancient blood? I know. I know, yet I may not say, since the Spirit of spirits whose
image he wears upon his heart bids me be silent. Be bold! Be bold! Prosper and grow great,
Child of Pachacamac, for thy wanderings are not yet done. Still there is a mountain to be climbed,
and on the crest of it hangs a fringe of Heaven's gold."

Again the voice ceased, while this time all stared at Kari, who shook his head humbly as though
bewildered by what he could not understand. Once more the image spoke:

"Who is this daughter of the Sun, in whose veins play moonbeams and who is fairer than the
evening star? One, I think, whom men shall desire and because of whom shall flow the blood
of the great. One whose thought is swift as the lightning and subtle as the snake, one in whom
passion burns like fire in the womb of the mountain, but who is filled with spirit that dances
above the fire and who longs for things that are afar. Daughter of the Sun in whose blood run
the moonbeams, thou shalt slip from the hated arms and the Sun shall be thy shelter, and in
the beloved arms thou shalt sleep at last. Yet from the vengeance of the god betrayed fly fast
and far!"

Again the voice ceased, and I thought that all was over. But it was not so, for after a little
space the golden figure of the oracle glowed more fiercely than before and the emerald eyes
shone more terribly, and in a kind of scream it spoke, saying:

"The snows of Tavantinsuyu shall be red with blood, the waters of her rivers shall be full
of blood. Yes, ye three shall wade through blood, and in a rain of blood shall pluck the fruit
of your desires. Still for a while the gods of Tavantinsuyu shall endure and its kings shall
reign and its children shall be free. But in the end death for the gods and death for the kings
and death for the people. Still, not yet--not yet! None who live shall see it, nor their children,
nor their children's children. Rimac the Voice has spoken; treasure ye his words and interpret
them as ye will."

The whistling voice died away like the thin cry of some starving child in a desert, and there
was a great silence. Then in a moment the figure of gold ceased to glow and the eyes of emerald
to burn, leaving the thing but a dead lump of metal. The priests prostrated themselves, and
rising, led us from the place without a word, but in the light of the lamps I saw that their
faces were full of terror--so full that I doubted whether it could be feigned.

As we had come, so we went, and at last found ourselves outside the glittering temple doors
where the litters awaited us.

"What did it mean?" I whispered to Quilla, who was by my side.

"For you and the other I know not," she answered hurriedly; "but for me I think that it means
death. Yet, not until--not until----" And she ceased.

At that moment the moon appeared from behind the rain-clouds and shone upon her upturned face,
and in her eyes there was a glory.

Now, as I learned afterwards, these words of its most famous oracle went all through the land
and caused great talk and wonder mixed with fear, for none of such import had been spoken by
it for generations. More, they shaped my own fortunes, for, as I came to know, Quismancu and
his people had determined that I should not be allowed to go from among them. Not every day
did a white god rise from the sea, and they desired that having come to them, there he should
bide to be their defence and boast, and with him that hermit named Zapana, to whom, as they
believed, he had appeared upon the desert isle. But after Rimac had spoken all this was changed,
and when I said it was my will to depart and accompany Quilla upon her journey home to her
father, Huaracha, King of the Chancas, as by swift messenger this King invited me to do, Quismancu
answered that if I so desired I must be obeyed as the god Rimac had commanded, but that nevertheless
he was sure that we should meet again.

Now, thinking these things over, I wondered much whether that oracle came out of the golden
Rimac or perchance from the heart of Quilla, or of Kari, or of both of them, who desired that
I should leave the Yuncas and travel to the Chancas and further. I did not know, nor was I
ever to learn, since about matters to do with their gods these people are as secret as the
grave. I asked Kari and I asked Quilla, but both of them stared at me with innocent eyes, and
replied who were they to inspire the golden tongue of Rimac? Nor, indeed, did I ever learn
whether Rimac the Speaker was a spirit or but a lump of metal through which some priest talked.
All I know is that from one end of Tavantinsuyu to the other he was believed to be a spirit
who spoke the very will of God to those who could understand his words, though this as a Christian
man I could not credit.

So it came about that some days later, with Quilla and Kari and certain old men who, I took
it, were priests or ambassadors, or both, I departed on our journey. As we went the people
wept around my litter for sorrow, real or feigned, for we travelled in litters guarded by some
two hundred soldiers armed with axes of copper and bows, and cast flowers before the feet of
the bearers. But I did not weep, for though I had been very kindly treated there and, indeed,
worshipped, glad was I to see the last of that city and its people who wearied me.

Moreover, I felt that there I was in the midst of plots, though of what these were I knew nothing,
save that Quilla, who to the outward eye was but a lovely, innocent maiden, had a hand in them.
Plots there were indeed, for, as I came to understand in time, they were nothing less than
the preparing of a great war which the Chancas and the Yuncas were to wage against their over-lord,
the Inca, the king of the mighty nation of the Quichuas, who had his home at a city called
Cuzco far inland. Indeed, there and then this alliance was arranged, and by Quilla--Quilla,
who proposed to sacrifice herself and by the gift of her person to his heir, to throw dust
in the eyes of the Inca, whose dominion her father planned to take and with it the imperial
crown of Tavantinsuyu.

Leaving the coastland, we were borne forward through the passes of great mountains, upon a
wonderful road so finely made that never had I seen its like in England. At times we crossed
rivers, but over these were thrown bridges of stone. Or mayhap we came to swamps, yet there
the road still ran, built upon deep foundations in the mud. Never did it turn aside; always
it went on, conquering every hindrance, for this was one of the Inca's roads that pierced Tavantinsuyu
from end to end. We came to many towns, for this land was thickly populated, and for the most
part slept in one of them each night. But always my fame had gone before me, and the Curacas,
or chiefs of the towns, waited upon me with offerings as though I were indeed divine.

For the first five days of that journey I saw little of Quilla, but at length one night we
were forced to camp at a kind of rest-house upon the top of a high mountain pass, where it
was very cold, for the deep snow lay all about. At this place, as here were no Curacas to trouble
me, I went out alone when Kari was elsewhere, and climbed a certain peak which was not far
from the rest-house, that thence I might see the sunset and think in quiet.

Very glorious was the scene from that high point. All round me stood the cold crests of snow-clad
mountains towering to the very skies, while between them lay deep valleys where rivers ran
like veins of silver. So immense was the landscape that it seemed to have no end, and so grand
that it crushed the spirit, while above arched the perfect sky in whose rich blue the gorgeous
lights of evening began to gather as the great sun sank behind the snowy peaks.

Far up in the heavens floated one wide-winged bird, the eagle of the mountains, which is larger
than any other fowl that I have ever seen, and the red light playing on it turned it to a thing
of fire. I watched that bird and wished that I too had pinions which could bear me far away
to the sea and over it.

And yet did I wish to go who had no home left on all the earth and no kind heart that would
welcome me? Awhile ago I should have answered, "Yes, anywhere out of this loneliness," but
now I was not so sure. Here at least Kari was my friend if a jealous one, though of late, as
I could see, he was thinking of other things than friendship--dark plottings and high ambitions
of which as yet he said little to me.

Then there was that strange and beautiful woman, Quilla, to whom my heart went out and not
only because she was beautiful, and who, as I thought, at times looked kindly on me. But if
so, what did it avail; seeing that she was promised in marriage to some high-placed native
man who would be a king? Surely I had known enough of women who were promised in marriage to
other men, and should do well to let her be.

Thinking thus, desolation took hold of me and I sat myself down on a rock and covered my face
with my hands that I might not see the tears, which I knew were gathering in my eyes, as they
fell from them. Yes, there in the midst of that awful solitude, I, Hubert of Hastings, whose
soul it filled, sat down like a lost child and wept.

Presently I felt a touch upon my shoulder and let fall my hands, thinking that Kari had found
me out, to hear a soft voice, the voice of Quilla, say:

"So it seems that the gods can weep. Why do you weep, O God-from-the-Waves who here are named
Hurachi?"

"I weep," I answered, "because I am a stranger in a strange land; I weep because I have not
wings whereon I can fly away like that great bird above us."

She looked at me awhile, then said, most gently:

"And whither would you fly, O God-from-the-Sea? Back into the sea?"

"Cease to call me a god," I answered, "who, as you know well, am but a man though of another
race than yours."

"I thought it but I did not know. But whither would you fly, O Lord Hurachi?"

"To the land where I was born, Lady Quilla; the land that I shall never see again."

"Ah! doubtless there you have wives and children for whom your heart is hungry."

"Nay, now I have neither wife nor child."

"Then once you had a wife. Tell me of that wife. Was she fair?"

"Why should I tell you a sad story? She is dead."

"Dead or living, you still love her, and where there is love there is no death."

"Nay, I only love what I thought she was."

"Was she false, then?"

"Yes, false and yet true. So true that she died because she was false."

"How can a woman be both false and true?"

"Woman can be all things. Ask the question of your own heart. Can you not perchance be both
false and true?"

She thought awhile and, leaving this matter, said:

"So, having once loved, you can never love again."

"Why not? Perchance I can love too much. But what would be the use when more love would but
mean more loss and pain?"

"Whom should you love, my lord Hurachi, seeing that the women of your own folk are far away?"

"I think one who is very near, if she would pay back love for love."

Quilla made no answer, and I thought that she was angry and would go away. But she did not;
indeed, she sat herself down upon the stone at my side and covered her face with her hands
as I had done and began to weep as I had done. Now in my turn I asked her:

"Why do you weep?"

"Because I, too, must know loneliness, and with it shame, Lord Hurachi."

At these words my heart beat and passion flamed up in me. Stretching out my hand I drew hers
away and in the dying light gazed at the face beneath. Lo! on its loveliness there was a look
which could not be misread.

"Do you, then, also love?" I whispered.

"Aye, more, I think, than ever woman loved before. From the moment when first I saw you sleeping
in the moonbeams on the desert isle, I knew my fate had found me, and that I loved. I fought
against it because I must, but that love has grown and grown, till now I am all love, and,
having given everything, have no more left to give."

When I heard this, making no answer, I swept her into my arms and kissed her, and there she
lay upon my breast and kissed me back.

"Let me go, and hear me," she murmured presently, "for you are strong and I am weak."

I obeyed, and she sank back upon the stone.

"My lord," she said, "our case is very sad, or at least my case is sad, since though you being
a man may love often, I can love but once, and, my lord, it may not be."

"Why not?" I asked hoarsely. "Your people think me a god; cannot a god take whom he wills to wife?"

"Not when she is vowed to another god, he who will be Inca; not when on her, mayhap, hangs
the fate of nations."

"We might fly, Quilla."

"Whither could the God-from-the-Sea fly and whither could fly the daughter of the Moon, who
is vowed to the son of the Sun in marriage, save to death?"

"There are worse things than death, Quilla."

"Aye, but my life is in pawn. I must live that my people may not die. Myself I offered it to
this cause and now, being royal, I cannot take it back again for my own joy. It is better to
be shamed with honour than to be loved in the lap of shame."

"What then?" I asked hopelessly.

"Only this, that above us are the gods, and--heard you not the oracle of Rimac that declared
to me that I should slip from the hated arms, that the Sun should be my shelter, and in the
beloved arms I should sleep at last, though from the vengeance of the god betrayed I must fly
fast and far? I think that this means death, but also it means life in death and--O arms beloved,
you shall fold me yet. I know not how, but have faith--for you shall fold me yet. Meanwhile,
tempt me not from the path of honour, since this I know, that it alone can lead me to my home.
Yet who is the god betrayed from whom I must fly? Who, who?"

Thus she spoke and was silent, and I, too, was silent. Yes, there we sat, both silent in the
darkness, searching the heavens for a guiding star. And as we sat, presently I heard the voice
of Kari saying:

"Have I found you, Lord, and you also, Lady Quilla? Return, I pray you, for all search and
are frightened."

"Why?" I answered. "The lady Quilla and I study this wondrous scene."

"Yes, Lord, though to those who are not god-born it would be difficult in this darkness. Suffer,
now that I show you the path."

CHAPTER V

KARI GOES

As it chanced during the remaining days of that journey, Quilla and I were not again alone
together (that is to say, except once for a few minutes), for we were never out of eyeshot
of someone in our company. Thus Kari clung to me very closely, indeed, and when I asked him
why, told me bluntly that it was for my safety's sake. A god to remain a god, he said, should
live alone in a temple. When he began to mix with others of the earth and to do those things
they did, to eat and to drink, to laugh and to frown; even to slip in the mud or to stumble
over the stones in the common path, those others would come to think that there was small difference
between god and man. Especially would they think so if he were observed to love the company
of women or to melt beneath their soft glances.

Now I grew sore at the sting of these arrows which of late he had loved to shoot at me, and
without pretending to misunderstand him, said outright:

"The truth is, Kari, that you are jealous of the lady Quilla as once you were jealous of another."

He considered the matter in his grave fashion, and answered:

"Yes, Master, that is the truth, or part of it. You saved my life, and sheltered me when I
was alone in a strange land, and for this and for yourself I came to love you very greatly,
and love, if it be true, is always jealous and always hates a rival."

"There are different sorts of loves," I said; "that of a man for man is one, that of man for
woman is another."

"Yes, Master, and that of woman for man is a third; moreover, there is this about it--it is
the acid which turns all other loves sour. Where are a man's friends when a woman has him by
the heart?--although perchance they love him better than ever will the woman who at bottom
loves herself best of all. Still, let that be, for so Nature works, and who can fight against
Nature? What Quilla takes, Kari loses, and Kari must be content to lose."

"Have you done?" I asked angrily, who wearied of his homilies.

"No, Master. The matter of jealousy is small and private; so is the matter of love. But, Master,
you have not told me outright whether you love the lady Quilla, and, what is more important,
whether she loves you."

"Then I will tell you now. I do and she does."

"You love the lady Quilla and she says that she loves you, which may or may not be true, or
if true to-day may be false to-morrow. For your sake I hope that it is not true."

"Why?" I said in a rage.

"Because, Master, in this land there are many sorts of poison, as I have learned to my cost.
Also there are knives, if not of steel, and many who might wish to discover whether a god who
courts women like a man can be harmed by poisons or pierced by knives. Oh!" he added, in another
tone, ceasing from his bitter jests, "believe me that I would shield, not mock you. This Lady
Quilla is a queen in a great game of pieces such as you taught me to play far away in England,
and without her perchance that game cannot be won, or so those who play it think. Now you would
steal that queen and thereby, as they also think, bring death and destruction on a country.
It is not safe, Master. There are plenty of fair women in this land; take your pick of them,
but leave that one queen alone."

"Kari," I answered, "if there be such a game, are you not perchance one of the players on this
side or on that?"

"It may be so, Master, and if you have not guessed it, perhaps one day I will tell you upon
which side I play. It may even be that for my own sake I should be glad to see you lift this
queen from off the board, and that what I tell you is for love of you and not of myself, also
of the lady Quilla, who, if you fall, falls with you down through the black night into the
arms of the Moon, her mother. But I have said enough, and indeed it is foolish to waste breath
in such talk, since Fate will have its way with both of you, and the end of the game in which
we play is already written in Pachacamac's book for every one of us. Did not Rimac speak of
it the other night? So play on, play on, and let Destiny fulfil itself. If I dared to give
counsel it was only because he who watches the battle with a general's eye sees more of it
than he who fights."

Then he bowed in his stately fashion and left me, and it was long ere he spoke to me again
of this matter of Quilla and our love for one another.

When he was gone my anger against him passed, since I saw that he was warning me of more than
he dared to say, not for himself, but because he loved me. Moreover, I was afraid, for I felt
that I was moving in the web of a great plot that I did not understand, of which Quilla and
those cold-eyed lordlings of her company and the chief whose guest I had been, and Kari himself,
and many others as yet unknown to me, spun the invisible threads. One day these might choke
me. Well, if they did, what then? Only I feared for Quilla--greatly I feared for Quilla.

On the day following my talk with Kari at length we reached the great city of the Chancas,
which, after them, was called Chanca--at least I always knew it by that name. From the dawn
we had been passing through rich valleys where dwelt thousands of these Chancas who, I could
see, were a mighty people that bore themselves proudly and like soldiers. In multitudes they
gathered themselves together upon either side of the road, chiefly to catch a sight of me,
the white god who had risen from the ocean, but also to greet their princess, the lady Quilla.

Indeed, now I learned for the first time how high a princess she was, since when her litter
passed, these folk prostrated themselves, kissing the air and the dust. Moreover, as soon as
she came among them Quilla's bearing changed, for her carriage grew more haughty and her words
fewer. Now she seldom spoke save to issue a command, not even to myself, although I noted that
she studied me with her eyes when she thought that I was not observing her.

During our midday halt I looked up and saw that an army was approaching us, five thousand men
or more, and asked Kari its meaning.

"These," he answered, "are some of the troops of Huaracha, King of the Chancas, whom he sends
out to greet his daughter and only child, also his guest, the White God."

"Some of the troops! Has he more, then?"

"Aye, Master, ten times as many, as I think. This is a great people; almost as great as that
of the Incas who live at Cuzco. Come now into the tent and put on your armour, that you may
be ready to meet them."

I did so, and, stepping forth clad in the shining steel, took my stand where Kari showed me,
upon a rise of ground. On my right at a little distance stood Quilla, more splendidly arrayed
than I had ever seen her, and behind her her maidens and the captains and counsellors of her
following.

The army drew nearer, marshalled in regiments and halted on the plain some two hundred yards
away. Presently from it advanced generals and old men, clad in white, whom I took to be priests
and elders. They approached to the number of twenty or more and bowed deeply, first to Quilla,
who bent her head in acknowledgment and then to myself. After this they went to speak with
Quilla and her following, but what they said I did not know. All the while, however, their
eyes were fixed on me. Then Quilla brought them to me and one by one they bowed before me,
saying something in a language which I did not understand well, for it was somewhat different
from that which Kari had taught me.

After this we entered the litters, and, escorted by that great army, were borne forward down
valleys and over ridges till about sunset we came to a large cup-like plain in the centre of
which stood the city called Chanca. Of this city I did not see much except that it was very
great as the darkness was falling when we entered, and afterwards I could not go out because
of the crowds that pressed about me. I was borne down a wide street to a house that stood in
a large garden which was walled about. Here in this fine house I found food prepared for me,
and drink, all of it served in dishes and cups of gold and silver; also there were women who
waited upon me, as did Kari who now was called Zapana and seemed to be my slave.

When I had eaten I went out alone into the garden, for on this plain the air was very warm
and pleasant. It was a beautiful garden, and I wandered about among its avenues and flowering
bushes, glad to be solitary and to have time to think. Amongst other things I wondered where
Quilla might be, for of her I had seen nothing from the time that we entered the town. I hated
to be parted from her, because in this vast strange land into which I had wandered she was
the only one for whom I had come to care and without whom I felt I should die of loneliness.

There was Kari, it is true, who I knew loved me in his fashion, but between him and me there
was a great gulf fixed, not only of race and faith, but of something now which I did not wholly
understand. In London he had been my servant and his ends were my ends; on our wandering he
had been my companion in great adventures. But now I knew that other interests and desires
had taken a hold of him, and that he trod a road of which I could not see the goal; and no
longer thought much of me save when what I did or desired to do came between him and that goal.

Therefore Quilla alone was left to me, and Quilla was about to be taken away. Oh! I wearied
of this strange land with its snowclad mountains and rich valleys, its hordes of dark-skinned
people with large eyes, smiling faces, and secret hearts; its great cities, temples, and palaces
filled with useless gold and silver; its brilliant sunshine and rushing rivers, its gods, kings,
and policies. They were alien to me, every one of them, and if Quilla were taken away and I
were left quite alone, then I thought that it would be well to die.

Something moved behind a palm trunk of the avenue in which I walked, and not knowing whether
it were beast or man, I laid my hand upon my sword which I still wore, although I had taken
off the armour. Before I could draw it my wrist was grasped and a soft voice whispered in my ear:

"Fear nothing; it is I--Quilla."

Quilla it was, wrapped in a long hooded cloak such as the peasant women wear in the cold country,
for she threw back the hood and a beam of starlight fell upon her face.

"Hearken!" she said. "It is dangerous to both of us, but I have come to bid you farewell."

"Farewell! I feared it would be thus, but why so soon, Quilla?"

"For this reason, Love and Lord. I have seen my father the King, and made my report to him
of the matter with which I was sent to deal among the Yuncas. It pleased him, and since his
mood was gracious, I opened my heart to him and told him that no longer did I wish to be given
in marriage to Urco, who will soon put on the Inca fringe, for, as you know, it is to him that
I am promised!"

"What did he answer, Quilla?"

"He answered: 'This means, Daughter, that you have met some other man to whom you do wish to
be given in marriage. I will not ask his name, since if I knew it it would be my duty to kill
him, however high and noble he might be.'"

"Then he guesses, Quilla?"

"I think he guesses; I think that already some have whispered in his ear, but he does not wish
to listen who desires to remain deaf and blind."

"Did he say no more, Quilla?"

"He said much more; he said this--now I tell you secrets, Lord, and place my honour in your
keeping, for having given you all the rest, why should I not give you that also? He said: 'Daughter,
you who have been my ambassador, you, my only child, who know all my counsel, know also that
there is about to be the greatest war that the land of Tavantinsuyu has ever known, war between
the two mighty nations of the Quichuas of Cuzco whereof the old Upanqui is king and god, and
the Chancas whereof I am king and you, if you live, in a day to come will be the queen. No
longer can these two lions dwell in the same forest; one of them must devour the other; nor
shall I fight alone, since on our side are all the Yuncas of the coast who, as you report to
me, are ripe for rebellion. But, as you also report, and as I have learned from others, they
are not yet ready. Moons must go by before their armies are joined to mine and I throw off
the mask. Is it not so?'

"I answered that it was so, and my father went on:

"'Then during that time, Daughter, a dust must be raised that will hide the shining of my spears,
and, Daughter, you are that dust. To-morrow the old Inca Upanqui visits me here with a small
army. I read your thought. It is--Why do you not kill him and his army? Daughter, for this
reason. He is very aged and about to lay down his sceptre, who grows feeble of mind and body.
If I killed him what would it serve me, seeing that he has left his son, Urco, who will be
Inca, ruling at Cuzco, and that of his soldiers not one in fifty will be with him here? Moreover,
he is my guest, and the gods frown on those who slay their guests, nor will men ever trust
them more.'

"Now I answered: 'You spoke of me as a cloud of dust, Father; how, then, can this poor dust
serve your ends and those of the Chanca people?'

"'Thus Daughter,' he answered. 'With your own consent you are promised in marriage to Urco.
Upanqui the Inca has heard rumours that the Chancas prepare for war. Therefore, he who travels
on his last journey through certain of his dominions comes to lead you away, to be Urco's bride,
saying to himself, "If those rumours are true, King Huaracha will withhold his only child and
heiress, since never will he make war upon Cuzco if she rules there as its queen." Therefore,
if I refuse you to him, he will withdraw and begin the war, rolling down his thousands upon
us before we are ready, and bringing the Chancas to destruction and enslavement. Therefore
also not only my fate, but the fate of all your country lies in your hand.'

"'Father,' I said, 'tell me, who was ever dear to you that lack sons, is there no escape? Must
I eat this bitter bread? Before you answer, learn that you have guessed aright, and that I
who, when I made that promise, cared for no man, have come to feel the burning of love's fire!'

"Now he looked at me awhile, then said: 'Child of the Moon, there is but one escape, and it
must be sought--in the moon. The dead cannot be given in marriage. If your strait is so sore,
though it would cut me to the heart, perchance it is better that you should die and go whither
doubtless he whom you love will soon follow you. Depart now and counsel with Heaven in your
sleep. To-morrow, before Upanqui comes, we will talk again.'

"So I knelt and kissed the hand of the King, my father, and left him, wondering at his nobleness
who could show such a road to his only child, though its treading would mean woe to him and
mayhap the ruin of his hopes. Still that road is an old one among the women of my people, and
why should I not walk it, as thousands have done before me?"

"How came you here?" I asked hoarsely.

"Lord, I guessed that you would be walking in this garden which joins on to that of the palace,
and--none were about, and--the door in the wall was open. Indeed, it was almost as though I
were left alone and unwatched of set purpose. So I came and sought--and found, having a question
to put to you."

"What question, Quilla?"

"This: Shall I live or shall I die? Speak the word and I obey. Yet ere you speak, remember
that if I live we meet for the last time, since very soon I go hence to become the wife of
Urco and play the part that is prepared for me?"

Now when I, Hubert, heard these words, I felt as though my heart would burst within my breast
and knew not what to say. So to gain time I asked her:

"Which do you desire--to live or to die?"

She laughed a little as she answered:

"That is a strange question, Lord. Have I not told you that if I live I must do so befouled
as one of Urco's women, whereas, if I die, I die clean and take my love with me to where Urco
cannot come, but where, mayhap, another may follow at the appointed time."

"Which time would be very soon, I think, Quilla, seeing that he who had spoiled all this pretty
plot would scarcely be left long upon the earth, even if he wished to stay there. Yet I say:
Do not die--live on."

"To become Urco's woman! That is strange counsel from a lover's lips, Lord; such as would scarcely
have been given by any of our nobles."

"Aye, Quilla, and it is given because I am not of your people and do not think as they think,
who reject their customs. You are not yet Urco's wife, and may be rid of him by other paths
than that of death, but from the grave there is no escape."

"And in the grave there is no more fear, Lord. Thither Urco cannot come; there are neither
wars nor plottings; there honour does not beckon and love hold back. I say that I will die
and make an end, as for like causes many of my blood have done, though not here and now. When
I am about to be delivered to Urco then I will die, and perchance not alone. Perchance he will
accompany me," she added slowly.

"And if this happens, what shall I do?"

"Live on, Lord, and find other women to love you, as a god should. There are many in this land
fairer and wiser than I, and, save myself, you may take whom you will."

"Listen, Quilla. I have a story to tell you."

Then, as briefly as I could, I set out the tale of Blanche and of her end, while she hung upon
my every word.

"Oh! I grieve for you," she said, when I had finished.

"You grieve for me, and yet, what she did for my sake you would do also, so that, as it were,
both my hands must be dyed with blood. This first terror I have borne, but if a second falls
upon me then I know that I shall go mad and perish in this way or in that, and you, Quilla,
will be my murderess."

"No, no, not that!" she murmured.

"Then swear to me by your god and by your spirit, that you will do yourself no harm, whatever
chances, and that if die you must, it shall be with me for company."

"Is your love so great that you would dare this for my sake, Lord?"

"I think so, though not till all else had failed. I think that if you were taken from me, Quilla,
I could not live on here in loneliness and exile--however great the sin. But do you swear?"

"Aye, Love and Lord, I swear, for your sake. Moreover, I add to the oath. If perhaps we should
escape these perils and come together, I will be such a wife to you as never man has had. I
will wrap you round with love and lift you up to be a king, that you may live in glory forgetting
your home across the sea, and all the sorrows that befell you there. Children you shall have
also of whom you need not be ashamed, though my dark blood runs in them, and armies at command
and palaces filled with gold, and all royal joys. And if perchance the gods declare against
us, and we pass from the world together, then I think, oh! then I think that I shall give you
finer gifts than these, though what they are I know not yet, since to the power of love there
is no end--here on earth or yonder in the skies."

I stared at her face in the starlight, and oh! it had grown splendid. No longer was it that
of a woman, since through it, like light through pearl, shone a soul divine. It might have
been a goddess who stood beside me, for those eyes were holy and her embrace that wrapped me
close was not that of the flesh alone.

"I must be gone," she whispered, "but now I go without fear. Perchance we may not speak again
for long, but trust me always. Play your part and I will play mine. Follow me wherever I am
taken and keep near to me, if you may, as ever my spirit shall be near to you. Then what matters
anything, even if we are slain? Farewell, beloved, kiss me and farewell."

Another moment and she had glided away and was lost in the shadows.

She was gone, and I stood amazed and overcome. Oh! what a love it was that this alien woman
had given to me and how could I be worthy of it? Now I forgot my griefs; now I no longer mourned
because I was an outcast who nevermore might look upon the land where I was born, nor see the
face of one my own race or blood. All my loss was paid back to me again and yet again, in the
coin of the glory of this woman whom I had won. Dangers rose about us, but I feared them no
more, because I knew that her love's conquering feet would stamp them flat and lead me safe
to a joyful treasure-house of splendour of spirit and of body where we should dwell side by
side, triumphant and unafraid.

Whilst I thought thus, lost in a rapture such as I had not felt since Blanche kissed me at
the mouth of the Hastings cave after I had killed the three Frenchmen with as many arrows from
my black bow, I heard a sound and looked up to see a man standing before me.

"Who is it?" I asked, grasping my sword, for his face was hidden in the shadows.

"I," answered a voice which I knew to be that of Kari.

"Then how did you come here? I saw no one pass the open ground."

"Master, you are not the only one who loves to walk in gardens in the quiet of the night. I
was here before yourself, behind yonder tree," and he pointed to a palm not three paces distant.

"Then, Kari, you must have seen----"

"Yes, Master, I saw and heard, not everything, because there came a point at which I shut my
eyes and stopped my ears, but still much."

"I am minded to kill you, Kari," I said between my teeth, "who play the spy upon me."

"I guessed it would be so, Master," he replied in his gentlest voice, "and for that reason,
as you will notice, I am standing out of reach of your sword. You wonder why I am here. I will
tell you. It is not from any desire to watch your love-makings which weary me, who have seen
such before, but rather that I might find secrets, of which love is always the loser, and those
secrets I have learned. How could I have come by them otherwise, Master?"

"Surely you deserve to die," I exclaimed furiously.

"I think not, Master. But listen and judge for yourself. I have told you something of my story,
now you shall hear more, after which we will talk of what I do or do not deserve. I am the
eldest son of the Inca Upanqui, and Urco, of whom you have been talking is my younger brother.
But Upanqui, our father, loved Urco's mother while mine he did not love, and swore to her before
she died that against right and law, Urco, her son, should be Inca after him. Therefore he
hated me because I stood in Urco's path; therefore too many troubles befell me, and I was given
over into Urco's hand, so that he took my wife and tried to poison me, and the rest you know.
Now it was needful to me to learn how things went, and for this reason I listened to the talk
between you and a certain lady. It told me that Upanqui, my father, comes here to-morrow, which
indeed I knew already, and much else that I had not heard. This being so I must vanish away,
since doubtless Upanqui or his councillors would know me again, and as they are all of them
friends of Urco, perhaps I should taste more poison and of a stronger sort."

"Whither will you vanish, Kari?"

"I know not, Master, or if I know, I will not say, who have but just been taught afresh how
secrets can pass from ear to ear. I must lie hid, that is enough. Yet do not think that therefore
I shall desert you--I, while I live, will watch over you, a stranger in my country, as you
watched over me when I was a stranger in your England."

"I thank you," I answered, "and certainly you watch well--too well, sometimes, as I have found
to-night."

"You think it pleases me to spy upon you and a certain lady," went on Kari with an unruffled
voice, "but it is not so. What I do is for good reasons, amongst others that I may protect
you both, and if I can, bring about what you desire. That lady has a great heart, as I learned
but now, and after all you did well to love her, as she does well to love you. Therefore, although
the dangers are so many, if I am able, I will help you in your love and bring you together,
yes, and save her from the arms of Urco. Nay, ask me not how, for I do not know, and the case
seems desperate."

"But if you go, what shall I do alone?" I asked, alarmed.

Here Upanqui, who hitherto had been listening in silence to the words of Larico, spoken on
his behalf, broke in, saying:

"Yes, yes, that is right, only make him understand that the Inca will be his over-lord, since
the Inca can have no rivals in all the land."

"My answer is," said Huaracha, "that I will give my daughter in marriage as I have promised,
but that the Chancas are a free people and accept no over-lord."

"Foolishness, foolishness!" said Upanqui. "As well might the tree say that it would not bend
before the wind. However, you can settle that matter afterwards with Urco, and indeed with
your daughter, who will be his queen and is your heiress, for I understand you have no other
lawful child. Why talk of war and other troubles when thus your kingdom falls to us by marriage?
Now let me see this lady Quilla who is to become my daughter."

Huaracha, who had listened to all this babble with a stern set face, turned to Quilla and made
a sign. She descended from her chair and advancing, stood before the Inca, a vision of splendour
and of beauty, and bowed to him. He stared at her awhile, as did all his company, then said:

"So you are the lady Quilla. A fair woman, a very fair woman, and a proud, one who ought to
be able to lead Urco aright if any one can. Well named, too, after the moon, for the moonlight
seems to shine in your eyes, Lady Quilla. Indeed and indeed were I but a score of years younger
I should tell Urco to seek another queen and keep you for myself."

Then Quilla spoke for the first time, saying:

"Be it as you will, O Inca. I am promised in marriage to the Child of the Sun and which child
is nothing to me."

"Well said, Lady Quilla, and why should I wonder? Though I grow old they tell me that I am
still handsome, a great deal better looking than Urco, in fact, who is a rough man and of a
coarser type. You ask my wives when you come to Cuzco; one of them told me the other day that
there was no one so handsome in the whole city, and earned a beautiful present for her pretty
speech. What is it you say, Larico? Why are you always interfering with me? Well, perhaps you
are right, and, Lady Quilla, if you are ready, it is time to start. No, no, I thank you, Curaca,
but I will not stop for any feasting who desire to be back at my camp before dark, since who
knows what may happen to one in the dark in a strange country?"

Then at last Huaracha grew angry.

"Be it as you will, O Inca," he said, "but know that you offer me a threefold insult. First
you refuse the feast that has been made ready for you whereat you were to meet all the notables
of my kingdom. Secondly, you give me, who am a king, the title of a petty chief who owns your
rule. Thirdly, you throw doubts upon my honour, hinting that I may cause you to be murdered
in the dark. Now I am minded to say to you, 'Begone from my poor country, Lord Inca, in safety,
but leave my daughter behind you.'"

Now at these words, I, Hubert, saw the fires of hope burn up in the large eyes of Quilla, as
they did in my own heart, for might they not mean that she would escape from Urco after all?
But, alas, they were extinguished like a brand that is dipped in water.

"Tush, tush!" said the old dotard, "what a fire-eater are you, friend Huaracha. Know that I
never care to eat, except at night; also that the chill of the air after my father the Sun
has set makes my bones ache, and as for titles--take any one you like, except that of Inca."

"Mayhap that is the one I shall take before all is done," broke in the furious Huaracha, who
would not be quieted by the councillors whispering in his ears.

It was at this moment that the minister and high-priest, Larico, who had been noting all that
passed with an impassive face, said coldly:

"Be not wroth, O King Huaracha, and lay not too much weight upon the idle words of the glorious
Inca, since even the gods will doze at times when they are weighed down by the cares of empire.
No affront was meant to you and least of all does the Inca or any one of us, dream that you
would tarnish your honour by offering violence to your guests by day or by night. Yet know
this, that if, after all that has been sworn, you withhold your daughter, the lady Quilla,
from the house of Urco who is her lord to be, it will breed instant war, since as soon as word
of it comes to Cuzco, which will be within twenty hours, for messengers wait all along the
road, the great armies of the Inca that are gathered there will begin to move. Judge, then,
if you have the strength to withstand them, and choose whether you will live on in glory and
honour, or bring yourself to death and your people to slavery. Now, King Huaracha, speaking
on behalf of Urco, who within some few moons will be Inca, I ask you--will you suffer the lady
Quilla to journey with us to Cuzco and thereby proclaim peace between our peoples or will you
keep her here against your oath and hers, and thereby declare war?"

Huaracha sat silent, lost in thought, and the old Inca Upanqui began to babble again, saying:

"Very well put, I could not have said it better myself; indeed, I did say it, for this coxcomb
of a Larico, who thinks himself so clever just because I made him high-priest of the Sun under
me and he is of my blood, is after all nothing but the tongue in my mouth. You don't really
want to die, Huaracha, do you, after seeing most of your people killed and your country wasted?
For you know that is what must happen. If you do not send your daughter as you promised, within
a few hours a hundred thousand men will be marching on you and another hundred thousand gathering
behind them. Anyhow, please make up your mind one way or another, as I wish to leave this place."

Huaracha thought on awhile. Then he descended from his throne and beckoned to Quilla. She came
and he led her towards the back part of the pavilion behind and a little to the left of the
chair on which I sat where none could hear their talk save me, of whom he seemed to take no
note, perhaps because he had forgotten me, or perhaps because he desired that I should know all.

"Daughter," he said in a low voice, "what word? Before you answer remember that if I refuse
to send you, now for the first time I break my oath."

"Of such oaths I think little," answered Quilla. "Yet of another thing I think much. Tell me,
my father, if the Inca declares war and attacks us, can we withstand his armies?"

"No, Daughter, not until the Yuncas join us for we lack sufficient men. Moreover, we are not
ready, nor shall be for another two moons, or more."

"Then it stands thus, Father. If I do not go the war will begin, and if I do go it seems that
it will be staved off until you are ready, or perhaps for always, because I shall be the peace-offering
and it will be thought that I, your heiress, take your kingdom as my marriage portion to be
joined to that of the Incas at your death. Is it thus?"

"It is, Quilla. Only then you will work to bring it about that the Land of the Incas shall
be joined to the Land of the Chancas, and not that of the Chancas to that of the Incas, so
that in a day to come as Queen of the Chancas you shall reign over both of them and your children
after you."

Now I, Hubert, watching Quilla out of the corners of my eyes, saw her turn pale and tremble.

"Speak not to me of children," she said, "for I think that there will be none, and talk not
of future glories, since for these I care nothing. It is for our people that I care. You swear
to me that if I do not go your armies will be defeated and that those who escape the spear
will be enslaved?"

"Aye, I swear it by the Moon your mother, also that I will die with my soldiers."

"Yet if I go I leave behind me that which I love," here she glanced towards me, "and give myself
to shame, which is worse than death. Is that your desire, my father?"

"That is not my desire. Remember, Daughter, that you were party to this plan, aye, that it
sprang from your far-seeing mind. Still, now that your heart has changed, I would not hold
you to your bargain, who desire most of all things to see you happy at my side. Choose, therefore,
and I obey. On your head be it."

"What shall I say, O Lord, whom I saved from the sea?" asked Quilla in a piercing whisper,
but without turning her head towards me.

Now an agony took hold of me for I knew that what I bade her, that she would say, and that
perchance upon my answer hung the fate of all this great Chanca people. If she went they would
be saved, if she remained perchance she would be my wife if only for a while. For the Chancas
I cared nothing and for the Quichuas I cared nothing, but Quilla was all that remained to me
in the world and if she went, it was to another man. I would bid her bide. And yet--and yet
if her case were mine and the fate of England hung upon my breath, what then?

"Be swift," she whispered again.

Then I spoke, or something spoke through me, saying:

"Do what honour bids you, O Daughter of the Moon, for what is love without honour? The sovereign,
of her alley and porch and building, him temples and forums and limbs,
must very populate at extent of nursing, in a town from whose farthest
towers a apple was keep against the entrance of untamed barbarians.
The bard to whom bw had been intend the brilliance of italian pageantry
in a Forehead that he must today understand the uncivil farmers at
a ring was borne off as captives and sacrificing to a oxen and scratches
and little brilliant gem.

The man of fifty who had spent his youth in his writing of its love poesy and who understood
through all his time had had an Urania in the feature in Appearance
must not everywhere turn a headdress, and dream and seemed at night
of showed arrows and of fetters upon his wrists.

The boy of the soil, was dragged in warmth, his eye was accustomed
to flowers and Ellas and latin hayfield, me must have shiver within
most annum but union'malarkey were large limbs over the fields of
flurry which melted under neither rain; and in man could earlier
did know he did for that small breaking up the rest on the Danau,
while the i of the walled scratches to fruitage of subshrub, and of
the arrival of the could weather for derelict towards Italy and brooks.

The ear of the tongue, as the way in romanic circles think in Rome
must larn to compose and talk from playing to a jargon that he wished
to have been any communion towards his scratches. The intuition of a child,
whose sweeping caprices and bones, whose appetite health had been
the thing of offer eyes, he must everywhere larn to be barbarous without
proper Empire, must know merely his time wear acknowledged and gloomy
and rare and weak, have pierced from a covert of the love.

 Hark! his messengers call and search; my women can hold them back no more."

"I will stay," I answered hoarsely.

"I thank you, and now farewell, till in life or death we meet again. Thoughts come to my mind
which I have no time to utter."

"To mine also, Quilla, and here is one of them. You know the man who was with me on the island.
Well, he is more than he seems."

"So I guessed, but where is he now?"

"In hiding, Quilla. If you should chance to find him, bear in mind that he is an enemy of Urco
and one not friendless; also that he loves me after his fashion. Trust him, I pray you. Urco
is not the only one of the Inca blood, Quilla."

She glanced at me quickly and nodded her head. Then without more words, for officers were pressing
towards us, she drew a ring off her finger, a thick and ancient golden ring on which were cut
what looked like flowers, or images of the sun, and gave it to me.

"Wear this for my sake. It is very old and has a story of true love that I have no time to
tell," she said.

I took it and in exchange passed to her that ancient ring which my mother had given to me,
the ring that had come down to her with the sword Wave-Flame, saying:

"This, too, is old and has a story; wear it in memory of me."

Then we parted and presently she was gone.

I stood watching her litter till it vanished in the evening haze. Then I turned to go to find
myself face to face with Huaracha.

"Lord-from-the-Sea," he said, "you have played a man's--or a god's--part to-day. Had you bidden
my daughter bide here, she would have done so for love of you and the Chanca people must have
been destroyed, for as that old Inca or his spokesman told us, the breaking of my oath would
have been taken as a declaration of instant war. Now we have breathing time, and in the end
things may go otherwise."

"Yes," I answered, "but what of Quilla and what of me?"

"I know not your creed or what with you is honour, White Lord, but among us whom perhaps you
think of small account, it is thought and held that there are times when a man or a woman,
especially if they be highly placed, must do sacrifice for the good of the many who cling to
them for guidance and for safety. This you and my daughter have done and therefore I honour
both of you."

"To what end is the sacrifice made?" I asked bitterly. "That one people may struggle for dominion
over another people, no more."

"You are mistaken, Lord. Not for victory or to increase my dominions do I desire to war upon
the Incas, but because unless I strike I shall presently be struck, though for a little while
this marriage might hold back the blow. Alone in the midst of the vast territories over which
the Incas rule, the Chancas stem their tide of conquest and remain free amongst many nations
of slaved. Therefore for ages these Incas, like those who ruled before them at Cuzco, have
sworn to destroy us, and Urco has sworn it above all."

"Urco might die or be deposed, Huaracha."

"If so another would put on the Fringe and be vowed to the ancient policy that does not change
from generation to generation. Therefore I must fight or perish with my people. Hearken, Lord-from-the-Sea!
Stay here with me and become as my brother and a general of my armies, for where will they
not follow when you lead, who are held to be a god? Then if we conquer, in reward, from a brother
you shall become a son, and to you after me I swear shall pass the Chanca crown. Moreover,
to you, if she can be saved, I will give in marriage her whom you love. Think before you refuse.
I know not whence you come, but this I know: that you can return thither no more, unless, indeed,
you are a spirit. Here your lot is cast till death. Therefore make it glorious. Perchance you
might fly to the Inca and there become a marvel and a show, furnished with gold and palaces
and lands, but always you would be a servant, while I offer to you a crown and the rule of
a people great and free."

"I care nothing for crowns," I answered, sighing. "Still, such was Quilla's prayer, perchance
the last that ever she will make to me. Therefore I accept and will serve you and your cause,
that seems noble, faithfully to the end, O Huaracha."

Then I stretched out my hand to him and so our compact was sealed.

On the very next day my work began. Huaracha made me known to his captains, commanding them
to obey me in all things, which, looking on me as half divine, they did readily enough.

Now, of soldiering I knew little who was a seaman bred, yet as I had learned, a man of the
English race in however strange a country he finds himself can make a path there to his ends.

Moreover, in London I had heard much talk of armies and their ordering and often watched troops
at their exercise; also I know how to handle bow and sword, and was accustomed to the management
of men. So putting all these memories together, I set myself to the task of turning a mob of
half-savage fellows with arms into an ordered host. I created regiments and officered them
with the best captains that I could find, collecting in each regiment so far as possible the
people of a certain town or district. These companies I drilled and exercised, teaching them
to use such weapons as they had to the best purpose.

Also I caused them to shape stronger bows on the model of my own with which I had shot the
three Frenchmen far away at Hastings that, as it was said, once had been the battle-bow of
Thorgrimmer the Norseman my ancestor, as the sword Wave-Flame was his battle-sword. When these
Chancas saw how far and with what a good aim I could shoot with this bow, they strove day and
night to learn to equal me, though it is true they never did. Also I bettered their body-armour
of quilting by settings sheets of leather (since in that country there is no iron) taken from
the hides of wild animals and of their long-haired native sheep, between the layers of cotton.
Other things I did also, too many and long to record.

The end of it was that within three months Huaracha had an army of some fifty thousand men
who, if not well trained, still kept discipline, and could move in regiments; who knew also
how to shoot with their bows and to use their copper-headed spears and axes of that metal,
or of hard stone, to the best purpose.

Then at length came the Yuncas to join us, thirty or forty thousand of them, wild fellows and
brave enough, but undisciplined. With these I could do little since time was lacking, save
send some of the officers whom I had trained to teach their chiefs and captains what they were
able.

Thus I was employed from dawn till dark and often after it, in talk with Huaracha and his generals,
or in drawing plans with ink that I found a means to make, upon parchment of sheepskin and
noting down numbers and other things, a sight at which these people who knew nothing of writing
marvelled very much. Great were my labours, yet in them I found more happiness than I had known
since that fatal day when I, the rich London merchant, Hubert of Hastings, had stood before
the altar of St. Margaret's church with Blanche Aleys. Indeed, every cranny of my time and
mind being thus filled with things finished or attempted, I forgot my great loneliness as an
alien in a strange land, and once more became as I had been when I trafficked in the Cheap.

But toil as I would, I could not forget Quilla. During the day I might mask her memory in its
urgent business, but when I lay down to rest she seemed to come to me as a ghost might do and
to stand by my bed, looking at me with sad and longing eyes. So real was her presence that
sometimes I began to believe that she must have died to the world and was in truth a ghost,
or else that she had found the power to throw her soul afar, as it is said certain of these
Indian folk, if so they should be called, can do. At least there she seemed to be while I remained
awake and afterwards when I slept, and I know not whether her strange company joyed or pained
me more. For alas! she could not talk to me, or tell me how it fared with her, and, to speak
truth, now that she was the wife of another man, as I supposed, I desired to forget her if I could.

For of Quilla no word reached us. We heard that she had come safely to Cuzco and after that
nothing more. Of her marriage there was no tidings; indeed she seemed to have vanished away.
Certain of Huaracha's spies reported to him, however, that the great army which Urco had gathered
to attack him had been partly disbanded, which seemed to show that the Inca no longer prepared
for immediate war. Only then what had happened to Quilla, whose person was the price of peace?
Perhaps she was hidden away during the preparations for her nuptials; at least I could think
of nothing else, unless indeed she had chosen to kill herself or died naturally.

Soon, however, all news ceased, for Huaracha shut his frontiers, hoping that thus Urco might
not learn that he was gathering armies.

At length, when our forces were almost ready to march, Kari came, Kari whom I thought lost.

One night when I was seated at my work by lamplight, writing down numbers upon a parchment,
a shadow fell across it, and looking up I saw Kari standing before me, travel-worn and weary,
but Kari without doubt, unless I dreamed.

"Have you food, Lord?" he asked while I stared at him. "I need it and would eat before I speak."

I found meat and native beer and brought them to him, for it was late and my servants were
asleep, waiting till he had filled himself, for by this time I had learned something of the
patience of these people. At length he spoke, saying:

"Huaracha's watch is good, and to pass it I must journey far into the mountains and sleep three
nights without food amid their snows."

"Whence come you?" I asked.

"From Cuzco, Lord."

"Then what of the lady Quilla? Does she still live? Is she wed to Urco?"

"She lives, or lived fourteen days ago, and she is not wed. But where she is no man may ever
come. You have looked your last upon the lady Quilla, Lord."

"If she lives and is unwed, why?" I asked, trembling.

"Because she is numbered among the Virgins of the Sun our Father, and therefore inviolate to
man. Were I the Inca, though I love you and know all, should you attempt to take her, yes,
even you, I would kill you if I could, and with my own sword. In our land, Lord, there is one
crime which has no forgiveness, and that is to lay hands upon a Virgin of the Sun. We believe,
Lord, that if this is done, great curses will fall upon our country, while as for the man who
works the crime, before he passes to eternal vengeance he and all his house and the town whence
he came must perish utterly, and that false virgin who has betrayed our father, the Sun, must
die slowly and by fire."

"Has this ever chanced?" I asked.

"History does not tell it, Lord, since none have been so wicked, but such is the law."

I thought to myself that it was a very evil law, and cruel; also that I would break it if I
found opportunity, but made no answer, knowing when to be silent and that I might as well strive
to move a mountain from its base as to turn Kari from the blindness of his folly bred of false
faith. After all, could I blame him, seeing that we held the same of the sacredness of nuns
and, it was said, killed them if they broke their vows?

"What news, Kari?" I asked.

"Much, Lord. Hearken. Disguised as a peasant who had come into this country to barter wool
from a village near to Cuzco, I joined myself to the train of the Inca Upanqui, among whose
lords I found a friend who had loved me in past years and kept my secret as he was bound to
do, having passed into the brotherhood of knights with me while we were lads. Through him,
in place of a man who was sick, I became one of the bearers of the lady Quilla's litter and
thus was always about her and at times had speech with her in secret, for she knew me again
notwithstanding my disguise and uniform. So I became one of those who waited on her when she
ate and noted all that passed.

"After the first day the Inca Upanqui, he who is my father and whose lawful heir I am, although
he discarded me for Urco and believes me dead, made it a habit to take his food in the same
tent or rest-house chamber as the lady Quilla. Lord, being very clever, she set herself to
charm him, so that soon he began to dote upon her, as old, worn-out men sometimes do upon young
and beautiful women. She, too, pretended to grow fond of him and at last told him in so many
words that she grieved it was not he that she was to marry whose wisdom she hung upon, in place
of a prince who, she heard, was not wise. This, she said, because she knew well that the Inca
would never marry any more and indeed had lived alone for years. Still, being flattered, he
told her it was hard that she should be forced to wed one to whom she had no mind, whereon
she prayed him, even with tears, to save her from such a fate. At last he vowed that he would
do so by setting her among the Virgins of the Sun on whom no man may look. She thanked him
and said that she would consider the matter, since, for reasons that you may guess, Lord, she
did not desire to become a Virgin of the Sun and to pass the rest of her days in prayer and
the weaving of the Inca's garments.

"So it went on until when we were a day's march from Cuzco, Urco, my brother, came to meet
his promised bride. Now, Urco is a huge man and hideous, one whom none would believe to have
been born of the Inca blood. Coarse he is, and dissolute, given to drink also, though a great
fighter and brave in battle, and quick-brained when he is sober. I was present when they met
and I saw the lady Quilla shiver and turn pale at the sight of him, while he on his part devoured
her beauty with his eyes. They spoke but few words together, yet before these were done, he
told her it was his will that they should be wed at once on the day after she came to Cuzco,
nor would he listen to the Inca Upanqui who said, being cunning and wishing to gain time, that
due preparation must be made for so great a business.

"Thereupon Urco grew angry with his father, who both fears and loves him, and answered that,
being almost Inca, this matter was one which he would settle for himself. So fierce was he
that Upanqui became afraid and went away. When they were alone Urco strove to embrace Quilla,
but she fled from him and hid with her maidens in a private place. After this, at the feast
Urco took too much drink according to his custom and was led away to sleep by his lords. Then
Quilla waited upon the Inca and said:

"'O Inca, I have seen the Prince and I claim your promise to save me from him. O Inca, abandoning
all thought of marriage, I will become the bride of our Father the Sun.'

"Upanqui, who was wroth with Urco because he had crossed his will, swore by the Sun itself
that he would not fail her, come what might, since Urco should learn that he was not yet Inca."

"What happened then?" I asked, staring him in the eyes.

"After this, Lord, when we were halted before making the state entry into Cuzco, for a moment
the lady Quilla found opportunity for private speech with me. This is what she said:

"'Tell my father, King Huaracha, that I have fulfilled his oath, but that I cannot marry Urco.
Therefore I seek refuge in the arms of the Sun, as the oracle Rimac foretold that I should
do, having to choose between this fate and that of death. Tell my Lord-from-the-Sea what has
befallen me and bid him farewell to me. Still say that he must keep a good heart, since I do
not believe that all is ended between us.'

"Then we were parted and I saw her no more."

"And did you hear no more, Kari?"

"I heard much, Lord. I heard that when Urco learned that the lady Quilla had vanished away
into the House of Virgins, whither he might not come, and that he was robbed of the bride whom
he desired, he grew mad with rage. Indeed, of this I saw something myself. Two days later,
with thousands of others I was in the great square in front of the Temple of the Sun, where
the Inca Upanqui sat in state upon a golden throne to receive the praise of his people upon
his safe return after his long and hard journey, and as some reported, to lay down his lordship
in favour of Urco; also to tell the people that the danger of war with the Chancas had passed
away. Scarcely had the ceremony begun when Urco appeared at the head of a number of lords and
princes of the Inca blood, who are of his clan, and I noticed that he was drunk and furious.
He advanced to the foot of the throne, almost without obeisance, and shouted:

"'Where is the lady Quilla, daughter of Huaracha, who is promised to me in marriage, Inca?
Why have you hidden her away, Inca?'

"'Because the Sun, our Father, has claimed her as his bride and has taken her to dwell in his
holy house, where never again may the eyes of man behold her, Prince!' answered Upanqui.

"'You mean that robbing me, you have taken her for yourself, Inca,' shouted Urco again.

"Then Upanqui stood up and swore by the Sun that this was not so and that what he had done
was done by the decree of the god and at the prayer of the lady Quilla, who having seen Urco,
had declared that either she would be wed to the god or die by her own hand, which would bring
the vengeance of the Sun upon the people.

"Then Urco went mad. He raved at the Inca and while all present shivered with fear, he cursed
the Sun our Father, yes, even when a cloud came up in the clear sky and veiled the face of
the god, heedless of the omen, he continued his curses and blasphemy. Moreover, he said that
soon he would be Inca and that then, if he must tear the House of Virgins stone from stone,
as Inca he would drag forth the lady Quilla and make her his wife.

"Now at these words Upanqui stood up and rent his robes.

"'Must my ears be outraged with such blasphemies?' he cried. 'Know, Son Urco, that this day
I was minded to take off the Royal Fringe and to set it on your head, crowning you Inca in
my place while I withdrew to pass the remainder of my days at Yucay in peace and prayer. My
will is changed. This I shall not do. My life is not done and strength returns to my mind and

For a while Huaracha stared at him astonished, then said:

"And if you prove it, what do you ask of me, O Kari?"

"The help of your armies to enable me to overthrow Urco, who is very strong, being the Commander
of the Quichua hosts."

"And if your tale be true and Urco is overthrown, what do you promise me in return?"

"The independence of the Chanca people, who otherwise must soon be destroyed, and certain other
added territories which you covet, while I am Inca."

"And with this my daughter, if she still lives?" asked Huaracha looking at him.

"Nay," replied Kari firmly. "As to the lady Quilla I promise nothing. She has vowed herself
to my Father the Sun, and what I have already told the Lord Hurachi here, who loves her I tell
you. Henceforward no man may look upon her, who is the Bride of the Sun, for if I suffered
this, certainly the curse of the Sun would fall upon me and upon my people. He who lays a hand
upon her I will strive to slay"--here he looked at me with meaning--"because I must or be accurst.
Take all else, but let the lady Quilla be. What the Sun has, he holds forever."

"Perhaps the Moon, her mother, may have something to say in that matter," said Huaracha gloomily.
"Still, let it lie for the while."

Then they fell to discussing the terms of their alliance and, when it came to battle, what
help Kari could bring from among those who clung to him in Cuzco.

After this Huaracha took me to another chamber, where we debated the business.

"This Kari, if he be Kari himself, is a bigot," he said, "and if he has his way, neither you
nor I will ever set eyes on Quilla again, because to him it is sacrilege. So, what say you?"

I answered that it would be best to make an alliance with Kari, whom I knew to be honest and
no Pretender, since without his help I did not think that it would be possible to defeat the
armies of the People of the Incas. For the rest, we must trust to chance, making no promises
as to Quilla.

"If we did they would avail little," said Huaracha, "seeing that without doubt she is dead
and only vengeance remains to us. There is more poison in Cuzco, White Lord!"

Eight days later we were marching on Cuzco, a great host of us, numbering at least forty thousand
Chancas and twenty-five thousand of the rebellious Yuncas, who had joined our standard.

On we marched by the great road over mountains and across plains, driving with us numberless
herds of the native sheep for food, but meeting no man, since so soon as we were out of the
territory of the Chancas all fled at our approach. At length one night we camped upon a hill
named Carmenca and saw beneath us at a distance the mighty city of Cuzco standing in a valley
through which a river ran. There it was with its huge fortresses built of great blocks of stone,
its temples, its palaces, its open squares, and its countless streets bordered by low houses.
Moreover, beyond and around it we saw other things, namely, the camps of a vast army dotted
with thousands of white tents.

"Urco is ready for us," said Kari to me grimly as he pointed to these tents.

We camped upon the hill Carmenca and that night there came to us an embassy which spoke in
the names of Upanqui and Urco, as though they reigned jointly. This embassy of great lords
who all wore discs of gold in their ears asked us what was our purpose. Huaracha answered--to
avenge the murder of the lady Quilla, his daughter, that he heard had been poisoned by Urco.

"How know you that she is dead?" asked the spokesman.

"If she is not dead," replied Huaracha, "show her to us."

"That may not be," replied the spokesman, "since if she lives, it is in the House of the Virgins
of the Sun, whence none come out and where none go in. Hearken, O Huaracha. Go back whence
you came, or the countless army of the Incas will fall upon you and destroy you, you and your
handful together."

"That is yet to be seen," answered Huaracha, and without more words the embassy withdrew.

That night also men crept into our camp secretly, who were of the party of Kari. Of Quilla
they seemed to know nothing, for none spoke of those over whom the veil of the Sun had fallen.
They told us, however, that the old Inca, Upanqui, was still in Cuzco and had recovered somewhat
from his sickness. Also they said that now the feud between him and Urco was bitter, but that
Urco had the upper hand and was still in command of the armies. These armies, they declared,
were immense and would fight us on the morrow, adding, however, that certain regiments of them
who were of the party of Kari would desert to us in the battle. Lastly, they said that there
was great fear in Cuzco, since none knew how that battle would end, which was understood by
all to be one for the dominion of Tavantinsuyu.

They had nothing more to say except that they prayed the Sun for our success to save them from
the tyranny of Urco. This prince, it appeared, suspected their conspiracy, for now the rumour
that Kari lived was everywhere, and having obtained the names of some who were connected with
it through his spies, he pursued them with murder and sudden death. They were poisoned at their
food; they were stabbed as they walked through the streets at night; their wives, if young
and fair, vanished away, as they believed into the houses of those who desired them; even their
children were kidnapped, doubtless to become the servants of whom they knew not. They had complained
of these things to the old Inca Upanqui, but without avail, since in such matters he was powerless
before Urco who had command of the armies. Therefore they would even welcome the triumph of
Huaracha, which meant that Kari would become Inca if with lessened territory.

Before they parted to play their parts, Kari brought them before me, whom in their foolishness
they worshipped, believing me to be in truth a god. Then he told them to have no fear, since
I would command the armies of Huaracha in the battle.

Having surveyed the ground while the light lasted, for the most of that night, together with
Huaracha and Kari, I toiled, making plans for the great fight that was to come. All being ready,
I lay down to sleep awhile, wondering whether it were the last time I should do so upon the
earth and, to tell the truth, not caring overmuch who, believing that Quilla was dead, had
it not been for my sins which weighed upon me with none to whom I might confess them, should
have been glad to leave the world and its troubles for whatever might lie beyond, even if it
were but sleep.

There comes a time to most men when above everything they desire rest, and now that hour was
with me, the exiled and the desolate. Here in this strange country and among these alien people
I had found one soul which was akin to mine, that of a beautiful woman who loved me and whom
I had come to love and desire. But what was the end of it? Owing to the necessities of statecraft
and her own nobleness, she had been separated from me and although, as it would seem, she had
as yet escaped defilement, was spirited away into the temple of some barbarous worship where
I was almost sure death had found her.

At the best she was blinded, and where she lay in her darkness no man might come because of
the superstitions of these folk. Even if Kari became Inca, it would not help me or her, should
she still live, since he was the fiercest bigot of them all and swore that he would kill me,
his friend, rather than that I should touch her, the vowed to his false gods.

Or perhaps, through the priests, to save himself such sorrow, he would kill her. At the least,
dead or not, she was lost to me, while I--utterly alone--must fight for a cause in which I
had but one concern, to bring some savage prince to his end because of his crime against Quilla.
And, if things went well and this chanced, what of the Future? Of what use to me were rewards
that I did not want, and the worship of the vulgar which I hated? Rather would I have lived
out my life as the humblest fisherman on Hastings beach, than be made a king over these glittering
barbarians with their gold and gems which could buy nothing that I needed, not even a Book
of Hours to feed my soul, or the sound of the English tongue to comfort my empty heart.

At length I fell asleep, and as it seemed but a few minutes later, though really six hours
had gone by, was awakened by Kari, who told me that the dawn was not far off and came to help
me to buckle on my armour. Then I went forth and together with Huaracha arranged our army for
battle. Our plan was to advance from our rising ground across a great plain beneath us which
was called Xaqui, but afterwards became known by the name of Yahuar-pampa, or Field of Blood.

This plain lay between us and the city of Cuzco, and my thought was that we would march or
fight our way across it and rush into the city which was unwalled, and there amidst its streets
and houses await the attack of the Inca hosts that were encamped upon its farther side, for
thus protected by their walls we hoped that we should be more equal to them. Yet things happened
otherwise, since with the first light, without which we did not dare to move over unknown ground,
we perceived that during the darkness the Inca armies had moved round and through the town
and were gathered by the ten thousand in dense battalions upon the farther side of the plain.

Now we took council together and in the end decided not to attack as we had proposed, but to
await their onslaught on the rocky ridge up which they must climb. So we commanded that our
army, which was marshalled in three divisions abreast and two wings with the Yuncas as a reserve
behind, should eat and make ready. In the centre of our main division, which numbered some
fifteen thousand of the Chanca troops, and a little in front of it, was a low long hill upon
the highest point of which I took my place, standing upon a rock with a group of captains and
messengers behind me and a guard of about a thousand picked men massed upon the slopes and
around the hill. From this high point I could see everything, and in my glittering armour was
visible to all, friends and foes together.

After a pause, during which the priests of the Chancas and of the Yuncas behind us sacrificed
sheep to the moon and the many other gods they worshipped, and those of the Quichuas, as I
could see from my rock, made prayers and offerings to the rising sun, with a mighty shouting
the Inca hosts began to advance across the plain towards us. Reckoning them with my eye I saw
that they outnumbered us by two or three to one; indeed their hordes seemed to be countless,
and always more of them came on behind from the dim recesses of the city. Divided into three
great armies they crept across the plain, a wild and gorgeous spectacle, the sunlight shining
upon the forest of their spears and on their rich barbaric uniforms.

A furlong or more away they halted and took counsel, pointing to me with their spears as though
they feared me. We stood quite still, though some of our generals urged that we should charge,
but this I counselled Huaracha not to do, who desired that the Quichuas should break their
strength upon us. At length some word was given; the splendid "rainbow Banner" of the Incas
was unfurled and, still divided into three armies with a wide stretch of plain between each
of them they attacked, yelling like all the fiends of hell.

Now they had reached us and there began the most terrible battle that was told of in the history
of that land. Wave after wave of them rolled up against us, but our battalions which I had
not trained in vain stood like rocks and slew and slew and slew till the dead could be counted
by the thousand. Again and again they strove to storm the hill on which I stood, hoping to
kill me, and each time we beat them back. Picking out their generals I loosed shaft after shaft
from my long bow, and seldom did I miss, nor could their cotton-quilted armour turn those bitter
arrows.

"The shafts of the god! The shafts of the god!" they cried, and shrank back from before me.

There appeared a man with a yellow fillet on his head and a robe that was studded with precious
stones; a huge man with great limbs and flaming eyes; a loose-mouthed, hideous man who wielded
a big axe of copper and carried a bow longer than any I had seen in that land. Hooking the
axe to his belt, he set an arrow on the bow and let drive at me. It sped true and struck me
full upon the breast, only to shatter on the good French mail, which copper could not pierce.

Again he shot, and this time the arrow glanced from my helm. Then I drew on him and my shaft,
that I had aimed at his head, cut away the fringe about his brow and carried it far away. At
this sight a groan went up from the lords about him, and one cried:

"An omen, O Urco, an evil omen!"

"Aye," he shouted, "for the White Wizard who shot the arrow."

Dropping the bow, he rushed up the hill at me roaring, axe aloft, and followed by his company.
He smote, and I caught the blow upon my shield, and striking back with Wave-Flame, shore through
the shaft of the axe that he had lifted to guard his head as though it had been made of reed,
aye, and through the quilted cotton on his shoulder strengthened with strips of gold, and to
the bone beneath.

Then a man slipped past me. It was Kari, striking at Urco with Deleroy's sword. They closed
and rolled down the slope locked in each other's arms. What chanced after this I do not know,
for others rushed in and all grew confused, but presently Kari limped back somewhat shaken
and bleeding, and I caught sight of Urco, little hurt, as it seemed, amidst his lords at the
bottom of the slope.

At this moment I heard a great shouting and looking round, saw that the Quichuas had broken
through our left and were slaughtering many, while the rest fled, also that our right was wavering.
I sent messengers to Huaracha, bidding him call up the Yunca rear guard. They were slow in
coming and I began to fear that all was lost for little by little the hordes of the men of
Cuzco were surrounding us.

Then it was that Kari, or some with him, lifted a banner that had been wrapped upon a pole,
a blue banner upon which was embroidered a golden sun. At the sight of it there was tumult
in the Inca ranks, and presently a great body of men, five or six thousand of them that had
seemed to be in reserve, ran forward shouting, "Kari! Kari!" and fell upon those who were pursuing
our shattered left, breaking them up and dispersing them. Also at last the Yuncas came up and
drove back the regiments that assailed our right, while from Urco's armies there rose a cry
of "Treachery!"

Trumpets blew and the Inca host, gathering itself together and abandoning its dead and wounded,
drew back sullenly on to the plain, and there halted in three bodies as before, though much
lessened in number.

Huaracha appeared, saying:

"Strike, White Lord! It is our hour! The heart is out of them."

The signal was given, and roaring like a hurricane, presently the Chancas charged. Down the
slope they went, I at the head of them with Huaracha on one side and Kari on the other. The
swift-footed Chancas outran me who was hindered by my mail. We charged in three masses as we
had stood on the ridge, following those open lanes of ground up which the foe had not come,
because these were less cumbered with dead and wounded. Presently I saw why those of Cuzco
had left these lanes untrod, for of a sudden some warriors, who had outstripped me, vanished.
They had fallen into a pit covered over with earth laid upon canes, of which the bottom was
set with sharp stakes. Others, who were running along the lanes of open ground to right and
left, also fell into pits of which there were scores all carefully prepared against the day
of battle. With trouble the Chancas were halted, but not before we had lost some hundreds of
men. Then we advanced again across that ground over which the Inca host had retreated.

At length we reached their lines, passing through a storm of arrows, and there began such a
battle as I had never heard of or even dreamed. With axes, stone-headed clubs and spears, both
armies fought furiously, and though the Incas still outnumbered us by two to one, because of
my training our regiments drove them back. Lord after lord rushed at me with glaring eyes,
but my mail turned their copper spears and knives of flint. Oh! Wave-Flame fed full that day,
and if Thorgrimmer my forefather could have seen us from his home in Valhalla, surely he must
have sworn by Odin that never had he given it such a feast.

The Inca warriors grew afraid and shrank back.

"This Red-Beard from the sea is indeed a god. He cannot be slain!" I heard them cry.

Then Urco appeared, bloody and furious, shouting:

"Cowards! I will show you whether he cannot be slain."

He rushed onward to meet--not me, but Huaracha, who seeing that I was weary, had leapt in front
of me. They fought, and Huaracha went down and was dragged away by some of his servants.

Now Urco and I were face to face, he wielding a huge copper-headed club with which, as my mail
could not be pierced, he thought to batter out my life. I caught the blow upon my shield, but
so great was the giant's strength that it brought me to my knees. Next second I was up and
at him. Shouting, I smote with both hands, for my shield had fallen. The thick, turban-like
headdress that Urco wore was severed, cut through as the axe had been, and Wave-Flame bit deep
into the skull beneath.

Urco fell like a stunned ox and I sprang upon him to make an end. Then it was that a rope was
flung about my shoulders, a noosed rope that was hauled tight. In vain I struggled. I was thrown
down; I was seized by a score of hands and dragged away into the heart of Urco's host.

Waiting till a litter could be brought, they set me on my feet again, my arms still bound by
the noose that these Indians call laso, which they know so well how to throw, the red sword
Wave-Flame still hanging by its thong from my right wrist. Whilst I stood thus, like a bull
in a net, they gathered round, staring at me, not with hate as it seemed to me, but in fear
and with reverence. When at length the litter came they aided me to enter it quite gently.

As I did so I looked back. The battle still raged but it seemed to me with less fury than before.
It was as though both sides were weary of slaughter, their leaders being fallen. The litter
was borne forward, till at length the noise of shouting and tumult grew low. Twisting myself
round I peered through the back curtains and saw that the Inca host and that of the Chancas
were separating sullenly, neither of them broken since they carried their wounded away with
them. It was plain that the battle remained drawn for there was no rout and no triumph.

I saw, too, that I was entering the great city of Cuzco, where women and children stood at
the doors of the houses gazing, and some of them wringing their hands with tears upon their faces.

Passing down long streets and across a bridge, I came to a vast square round which stood mighty
buildings, low, massive, and constructed of huge stones. At the door of one of these the litter
halted and I was helped to descend. Men beautifully clad in broidered linen led me through
a gateway and across a garden where I noted a marvellous thing, namely: that all the plants
therein were fashioned of solid gold with silver flowers, or sometimes of silver with golden
flowers. Also there were trees on which were perched birds of gold and silver. When I saw this
I thought that I must be mad, but it was not so, for having no other use for the precious metals,
of which they had so much abundance, thus did these Incas adorn their palaces.

Leaving the golden garden, I reached a courtyard surrounded by rooms, to one of which I was
conducted. Passing its door, I found myself in a splendid chamber hung with tapestries fantastically
wrought and having cushioned seats, and tables of rich woods incrusted with precious stones.
Here servants or slaves appeared with a chamberlain who bowed deeply and welcomed me in the
name of the Inca.

Then, as though I were something half divine, gently enough, they loosed the sword from my
wrist, took the long bow from my back, with the few arrows that remained, also my dagger, and
hid them away. They unbound me, and freeing me from my armour, as I told them how, and the
garments beneath, laved me with warm, scented water, rubbed my bruised limbs, and clothed me
in wonderful soft garments, also scented and fastened about my middle with a golden belt. This
done, food and spiced drinks of their native wine were brought to me in golden vessels. I ate
and drank and, being very weary, laid myself down upon one of the couches to sleep. For now
I no longer took any thought as to what might befall me, but received all as it came, good
and ill together, entrusting my body and soul to the care of God and St. Hubert. Indeed, what
else could I do who was disarmed and a prisoner?

When I awoke again, very stiff and bruised, but much refreshed, night had fallen, for hanging
lamps were lit about the room. By their light I saw the chamberlain of whom I have spoken standing
before me. I asked him his errand. With many bows he said that if I were rested the Inca Upanqui
desired my presence that he might speak with me.

I bade him lead on, and, with others who waited without, he conducted me through a maze of
passages into a glorious chamber where everything seemed to be gold, for even the walls were
panelled with it. Never had I dreamt of so much gold; indeed the sight of it wearied me till
I could have welcomed that of humble brick or wood. At the end of this chamber that was also
lit with lamps, were curtains. Presently these were drawn by two beautiful women in jewelled
skirts and head-dresses, and behind them on a dais I saw a couch and on the couch the old Inca
Upanqui looking feebler than when I had last beheld him in the Chanca city, and very simply
clad in a white tunic. Only on his head he wore the red fringe from which I suppose he never
parted day or night. He looked up and said:

"Greeting, White-Lord-from-the-Sea. So you have come to visit me after all, though you said
that you would not."

"I have been brought to visit you, Inca," I answered.

"Yes, yes, they tell me they captured you in the battle, though I expect that was by your own
will as you had wearied of those Chancas. For what laso can hold a god?"

"None," I answered boldly.

"Of course not, and that you are a kind of god there is no doubt because of the things you
did in that battle. They say that the arrows and spears melted when they touched you and that
you shot and cut down men by scores. Also that when the prince Urco tried to kill you, although
he is the strongest man in my kingdom, you knocked him over as though he had been a little
child and hacked his head open so that they do not know whether he will live or die. I think
I hope he will die, for you see I have quarrelled with him."

I thought to myself that so did I, but I only asked:

"How did the battle end, Inca?"

"As it began, Lord Hurachi. A great many men have been killed on both sides, thousands and
thousands of them, and neither army has the victory. They have drawn back and sit growling
at each other like two angry lions which are afraid to fight again. Indeed, I do not want them
to fight, and now that Urco cannot interfere, I shall put a stop to all this bloodshed if I
am able. Tell me, for you were with him, why does this Huaracha, who I hear is also wounded,
want to make war on me with those troublesome Chancas of his?"

"Because your son, the prince Urco, has poisoned, or tried to poison, his only child, Quilla."

"Yes, yes, I know, and it was a wicked thing to do. You see, Lord, what happened was this:
That lovely Quilla, who is fairer than her mother the Moon, was to have married Urco. But,
Lord, as it chanced on our journey together, although I am old--well, she became enamoured
of me, and prayed me to protect her from Urco. Such things happen to women, Lord, whose hearts,
when they behold the divine, are apt to carry them away from the vulgar," and he laughed in
a silly fashion like the vain old fool that he was.

"Naturally. How could she help it, Inca? Who, after seeing you, would wish to turn to Urco?"

"No one, especially as Urco is a coarse and brutal fellow. Well, what was I to do? There are
reasons why I do not wish to marry again at my age; indeed I am tired of the sight of women,
who want time to pray and think of holy things; also if I had done what she wished, some might
have thought that I had behaved badly to Urco. At the same time, a woman's heart is sacred
and I could not do violence to that of one so sweet and understanding and lovely. So I put
her into the House of the Virgins of the Sun where she will be quite safe."

"It seems that she was not safe, Inca."

"No, because that violent man, Urco, being disappointed and very jealous, through some low
creature of his, who waited on the Virgins, tried to poison her with a drug which would have
made her all swollen and hideous and covered her face with blotches, also perhaps have sent
her mad. Luckily one of the matrons, whom we call Mama-conas, knocked the cup away before she
drank, but some of the horrible poison went into her eyes and blinded her."

"So she lives, Inca."

"Certainly she lives. I have learnt that for myself, because in this country it is not wise
to trust what they tell you. You know as Inca I have privileges, and although even I do not
talk to them, I caused those Virgins of the Sun to be led in front of me, which in strictness
even I ought not to have done. It was a dreary business, Lord Hurachi, for though those Virgins
may be so holy, some of them are very old and hideous and of course Quilla as a novice came
last in the line conducted by two Mama-conas who are cousins of my own. The odd thing is that
the poison seems to have made her much more beautiful than before, for her eyes have grown
bigger and are glorious, shining like stars seen when there is frost. Well, there she is safe
from Urco and every other man, however wicked and impious. But what does this Huaracha want?"

"He wants his blinded daughter back, Inca."

"Impossible, impossible! Who ever heard of such a thing! Why, Heaven and Earth would come together
and the Sun, my father, and her husband, would burn us all up. Still, perhaps, we could come
to an agreement for Huaracha must have had enough fighting and very likely he will die. Now
I am tired of talking about the lady Quilla and I want to ask you something."

"Speak on, Inca."

Suddenly the old dotard's manner changed: he became quick and shrewd, as doubtless he was in
his prime, for this Upanqui had been a great king. At the beginning of our talk the two women
of whom I have spoken and the chamberlain had withdrawn to the end of the chamber where they
waited with their hands folded, like those who adore before an altar. Still he peered about
him to make sure that none were within hearing, and in the end beckoned to me to ascend the
dais and sit upon the couch beside him, saying:

"You see I trust you although you are a god from the sea who has been fighting against me.
Now hearken. You had a servant with you, a very strange man, who is said also to have come
out of the sea, though that I cannot believe since he is like one of our princes. Where is
that man?"

"With the army of Huaracha, Inca."

"So I have heard. I heard also that in the battle he hoisted a banner with the sun blazoned
on it, and that thereon certain regiments of mine deserted to Huaracha. Now, why did they do that?"

"I understand, O Inca, that the kings of this land have many children. Perhaps he might be
one of them."

"Ah! You are clever as a god should be. Well, I am a god also and the same thought has come
to me, although as a fact I have only had two legitimate sons and the others are of no account.
The eldest of these was an able and beautiful prince named Kari, but we quarrelled, and to
tell the truth there was a woman in the matter, or rather two women, for Kari's mother fought
with Urco's mother whom I loved, because she never scolded me, which the other did. So Urco
was named to be Inca after me. Yet that was not enough for him who remained jealous of his
brother Kari who outpassed him in all things save strength of body. They wooed the same beautiful
woman and Kari won her, whereon Urco seduced her from him, and afterwards he or someone killed
her. At least she died, I forget how. Then the lords of the Inca blood began to turn towards
Kari because he was royal and wise, which would have meant civil war when I had been gathered
to the Sun. Therefore Urco poisoned him, or so it was rumoured; at any rate, he vanished away,
and often since then I have mourned him."

"The dead come to life again sometimes, Inca."

"Yes, yes, Lord-from-the-Sea, that happens; the gods who took them away bring them back--and
this servant of yours--they say he is so like to Kari that he might be the same man grown older.
And--why did those regiments, all of them officered by men who used to love Kari, go over to
Huaracha to-day, and why do rumours run through the land like the wind that springs up suddenly
in fine weather? Tell me of this servant of yours and how you found him in the sea."

"Why should I tell you, Inca? Is it because you want to kill him who is so like to this lost
Kari of yours?"

"No, no--gods can keep each other's counsel, can they not? It is because I would give--oh!
half my godship to know that he is alive. Hark you, Urco wearies me so much that sometimes
I wonder whether he really is my son. Who can tell? There was a certain lord of the coastlands,
a hairy giant who, they said, could eat half a sheep at a sitting and break the backs of men
in his hands, of whom Urco's mother used to think much. But who can tell? No one except my
father, the Sun, and he guards his secrets--for the present. At least Urco wearies me with
his coarse crimes and his drunkenness, though the army loves him because he is a butcher and
liberal. We quarrelled the other day over the small matter of this lady Quilla, and he threatened
me till I grew wrath and said that I would not hand him my crown as I had purposed to do. Yes,
I grew wrath and hated him for whose sake I had sinned because his mother bewitched me. Lord-from-the-Sea,"
here his voice dropped to a whisper, "I am afraid of Urco. Even a god such as I am can be murdered,
Lord-from-the-Sea. That is why I will not go to Yucay, for there I might die and none know
it, whereas here I still am Inca and a god whom it is sacrilege to touch."

"I understand, but how can I help you, Inca, who am but a prisoner in your palace?"

"No, no, you are only a prisoner in name. At the worst Urco will be sick for a long while,
since the physicians say that sword of yours has bitten deep, and during that time all power
is mine. Messengers are at your service; you are free to come and go as you will. Bring this
servant of yours to my presence, for doubtless he trusts you. I would speak with him, O Lord-from-the-Sea."

"If I should do this, Inca, will the lady Quilla be given back to her father?"

"Nay, it would be sacrilege. Ask what else you will, lands and rule and palaces and wives--not
that. Myself I should not dare to lay a finger on her who rests in the arms of the Sun. What
does it matter about this Quilla who is but one fair woman among thousands?"

I thought awhile, then answered, "I think it matters much, Inca. Still, that this bloodshed
may be stayed, I will do my best to bring him who was my servant to your presence if you can
find me the means to come at him, and afterwards we will talk again."

"Yes, I am weary now. Afterwards we will talk again. Farewell, Lord-from-the-Sea."

CHAPTER IX

KARI COMES TO HIS OWN

When I awoke on the following morning in the splendid chamber of which I have spoken, it was
to find that my armour and arms had been restored to me, and very glad was I to see Wave-Flame
again. After I had eaten and, escorted by servants, walked in the gardens, for never could
I be left alone, marvelling at the wondrous golden fruits and flowers, a messenger came to
me, saying that the Villaorna desired speech with me. I wondered who this Villaorna might be,
but when he entered I saw that he was Larico, that same stern-faced, cunning-eyed lord who
had been the spokesman of the Inca when he visited the city of the Chancas. Also I learned
that Villaorna was his title and meant "Chief priest."

We bowed to each other and all were sent from the chamber, leaving us quite alone.

"Lord-from-the-Sea," he said, "the Inca sends me, his Councillor and blood relative, who am
head priest of the Sun, to desire that you will go on an embassy for him to the camp of the
Chancas. First, however, it is needful that you should swear by the Sun that you will return
thence to Cuzco. Will you do this?"

Now as there was nothing I desired more than to return to Cuzco where Quilla was, I answered
that I would swear by my own god, by the Sun, and by my sword, unless the Chancas detained
me by force. Further, I prayed him to set out his business.

He did so in these words:

"Lord, we have come to know, it matters not how, that the man who appeared with you in this
land is no other than Kari, the elder son of the Inca, whom we thought dead. Now it is in the
Inca's mind, and in the minds of us, his councillors, to proclaim the Prince Kari as heir to
the throne which soon he would be called upon to fill. But the matter is very dangerous, seeing
that Urco still commands the army and many of the great lords who are of his mother's House
cling to him, hoping to receive advancement from him when he becomes Inca."

"But, Priest Larico, Urco, they say, is like to die, and if so all this trouble will melt like
a cloud."

"Your sword bit deep, Lord, but I have it from his physicians that as the brain is uncut he
will not die, although he will be sick for a long while. Therefore we must act while he is
sick, since it is not lawful to bring about his end, even if he could be come at. Time presses,
Lord, for as you have seen, the Inca is old and feeble and his mind is weak. Indeed at times
he has no mind, though at others his strength returns to him."

"Which means that I deal with you who are the chief priest, and those behind you," I said,
looking him in the eyes.

"That is what it means, Lord. Now hearken while I tell you the truth. After the Inca I am the
most powerful man in Tavantinsuyu, indeed for the most part the Inca speaks with my voice although
I seem to speak with his. Yet I am in a snare. Heretofore I have supported Urco because there
was no other who could become Inca, although he is a brutal and an evil man. Of late, however,
since my return from the City of the Chancas, I have quarrelled with Urco because he has lost
that witch, the lady Quilla, whom he desires madly and lays the blame on me, and it has come
to my knowledge that when he succeeds to the throne it is his purpose to kill me, which doubtless
he will do if he can, or at the least to cast me from my place and power, which is as bad as
death. Therefore, I desire to make my peace with Kari, if he will swear to continue me in my
office, and this I can only do through you. Bring this peace about, Lord, and I will promise
you anything you may wish, even perchance to the Incaship itself, should aught happen to Kari
or should he refuse my offers. I think that the Quichuas might welcome a white god from the
Sea who has shown himself so great a general and so brave in battle, and who has knowledge
and wisdom more than theirs, to rule over them," he added reflectively. "Only then, Lord, it
would be needful to be rid of Kari as well as of Urco."

"To which I would never consent," I replied, "seeing that he is my friend with whom I have
shared many dangers. Moreover, I do not wish to be Inca."

"Is there then anything else that you wish very much, Lord? A thought came to me, yonder at
the City of the Chancas. By the way, how lovely is that lady Quilla and how royal a woman.
It is most strange that she should have turned her mind towards an aged man like Upanqui."

We looked at each other.

"Very strange," I said. "It seems to me sad also that this beauteous Quilla should be immured
in a nunnery for life. To tell you the truth, High-priest, since it is not good for man to
live alone, rather than that such a thing should have happened I would have married her myself,
to which perchance she might have consented."

Again we looked at each other and I went on:

"I hinted as much to Kari after we heard she was numbered amongst the Virgins, and asked him
whether, should he become Inca, he would take her thence and give her to me."

"What did he answer, Lord?"

"He said that though he loved me like a brother, first he would kill me with his own hand,
since such a deed would be sacrilege against the Sun. Last night also the Inca himself said
much the same."

"Is it so, Lord? Well, we priests bring up our Incas to think thus. If we did not, where would
our power be, seeing that we are the Voice of the Sun upon earth and issue his decrees?"

"But do you always think thus yourselves, O High-priest?"

"Not quite always. There are loopholes in every law of gods and men. For example, I believe
I see one in the instance of this lady Quilla. But before we waste more time in talking--tell
me, White Lord, do you desire her, and if so, are you ready to pay me my price? It is that
you shall assure to me the friendship of the prince Kari, should he become Inca, and the continuance
of my power and office."

"My answer is that I do desire this lady, O High-priest, and that if I can I will obtain from
Kari the promise of what you seek. And now where is the loophole?"

"I seem to remember, Lord, that there is an ancient law which says--that none who are maimed
may be the wives of the Sun. It is true that this law applies to them before they contract
the holy marriage. Still, if the point came up before me as high-priest, I might perhaps find
that it applied also to those who were maimed after marriage. The case is rare, for which precedents
cannot be found if the search be thorough. Now through the wickedness of Urco, as it happens,
this lady Quilla has been blinded, and therefore is no longer perfect in her body. Do you understand?"

"Quite. But what would Upanqui or Kari say? The Incas you declare are always bigots and might
interpret this law otherwise."

"I cannot tell, Lord, but let us cease from beating bushes. I will help you if I can, if you
will help me if you can, though I daresay that in the end you, who are not a bigot, must take
the law into your own hands, as perhaps the lady Quilla, who is a moon-worshipper, would be
willing to do also."

The finish of it was that this cunning priest and statesman and I made a bargain. If I could
win Kari over to his interests, then he swore by the Sun that he would gain me access to the
lady Quilla and help me to fly with her, if so we both wished, while I on my part swore to
plead his cause with Kari. Moreover, as he showed me, there was little fear that either of
us would break these oaths since henceforth each lay in the power of the other.

After this we passed on to public matters. I was charged to offer an honourable truce to Huaracha
and the Chancas with permission to them to camp their armies in certain valleys near to Cuzco
where they would be fed until peace was declared, which peace would give them all they needed,
namely, their freedom and safeguards from attack. For the rest I was to bring Kari and those
who had deserted to him on the yesterday into Cuzco where none would molest them.

Then he went, leaving me happier than I had been since I bade farewell to Quilla. For now at
last I saw light, a faint uncertain light, it was true, only to be reached, if reached at all,
through many difficulties and dangers, but still light. At last I had found someone in this
land of black superstition who was not a bigot, and who, being the High-priest of the Sun,
knew too much of his god to fear him or to believe that he should come down to earth and burn
it up should one of the hundreds of his brides seek another husband. Of course this Larico
might betray me and Quilla, but I did not think he would, since he had nothing to gain thereby,
and might have much to lose, for the reason that I was able, or he thought that I was able,
to set Kari against him. At least I could only go forward and trust to fortune, though in fact
hitherto she had never shown me favour where woman was concerned.

Awhile later I was being borne in one of the Inca's own litters back to the camp of the Chancas,
accompanied by an embassy of great lords.

We passed over that dreadful, bloodstained plain where, under a flag of truce, both sides were
engaged in burying the thousands of their dead, and came to the ridge whence we had charged
on the yester morn. Here sentries stopped us and I descended from my litter. When the Chancas
saw me in my armour come back to them alive, they set up a great shouting and presently I and
the lords with me were led to the pavilion of King Huaracha.

We found him lying sick upon a couch, for though he showed no wound he had been badly bruised
upon the body by a blow from Urco's club and, as I feared, was hurt in the bowels. He greeted
me with delight, since he thought that I might have been killed after I was captured, and asked
how I came to appear in his camp in the company of our enemies. I told him at once what had
chanced and that I was sworn to return to Cuzco when I had done my business. Then the Inca's
ambassadors set out their proposals for a truce, and retired, while Huaracha discussed them
with his generals and Kari, who also was overjoyed to see me safe.

The end of it was that they were accepted on the terms offered, namely, that Huaracha and his
army should withdraw to the valleys of which I have spoken, and there camp, receiving all the
food they needed until a peace could be offered such as he would be willing to accept. Indeed,
the Chancas were glad to agree to this plan for their losses in the battle had been very great
and they were in no state to renew the attack upon Cuzco, which was still defended by such
mighty hordes of brave warriors fighting for their homes, families, and freedom.

So all was agreed on the promise that peace should be made within thirty days or sooner, and
that if it were not the war should re-commence.

Then privately, I told Huaracha all that I had learned about Quilla and that I had still hopes
of saving her though what these were I did not tell him. When he had thought, he said that
now the fate of Quilla must be left in the hands of the gods and mine, since not even for her
could he neglect the opportunity of an honourable peace, seeing that another battle might mean
destruction. Also he pointed out that he was hurt and I who had been general under him was
a prisoner and bound by my oath to return to prison, so that the Chancas had lost their leaders.

After this we parted, I promising to work for his cause and to come to see him again, if I might.

These matters finished I went aside with Kari to a place where none could hear us, and there
laid before him the offers of Larico, the high-priest, showing him how the case stood. Of Quilla,
however, I said nothing to him, though it pained me to keep back part of the truth even from
Kari. Yet, what was I to do, who knew that if I told him all and he became Inca, or the Inca's
acknowledged heir, he would work against me because of his superstitious madness, and perhaps
cause Quilla to be killed by the priests, as one whose feet were set in the path of sacrilege?
So on this matter I held my peace, nor did he ask me anything concerning Quilla who, I think,
wished to hear nothing of that lady and what had befallen her.

When he had learned all, he said:

"This may be a trap, Lord. I do not trust yonder Larico, who has always been my enemy and Urco's
friend."

"I think he is his own friend first," I answered, "who knows that if Urco recovers he will
kill him, because he has taken the part of your father, Upanqui, in their quarrels, and suspects
him."

"I am not sure," said Kari. "Yet something must be risked. Did I not tell you when we were
sailing down the English river that we must put faith in our gods, yes, afterwards also, and
more than once? And did not the gods save us? Well, now again I trust to my god," and drawing
out the image of Pachacamac, which he wore round his neck, he kissed it, then turning, bowed
and prayed to the Sun.

"I will come with you," he said, when he had finished his devotions, "to live to be Inca, or
to die, as the Sun decrees."

So he came and with him some of his friends, captains of those who had deserted to him in the
battle. But the five thousand soldiers, or those who were left of them, did not come as yet
because they feared lest they should be set upon and butchered by the regiments of Urco.

That night, when we were back safe in Cuzco, Kari and the high-priest, Larico talked together
in secret. Of what passed between them he only told me that they had come to an agreement which
satisfied them both. Larico said the same to me when next I saw him, adding:

"You have kept your word and served my turn, Lord-from-the-Sea, therefore I will keep mine
and serve yours when the time comes. Yet be warned by me and say nothing of a certain lady
to the prince Kari, since when I spoke a word to him on the matter, hinting that her surrender
to her father Huaracha would make peace with him more easy and lasting, he answered that first
would he fight Huaracha, and the Yuncas as well, to the last man in Cuzco.

"To the Sun she has gone," he said, "and with the Sun she must stay, lest the curse of the
Sun and of Pachacamac, the Spirit above the sun, should fall on me and all of us."

Larico told me also that, fearing something, the great lords, who were of Urco's party, had
borne him away in a litter to a strong city in the mountains about five leagues from Cuzco,
escorted by thousands of picked men who would stay in and about that city.

On the next morning I was summoned to wait upon the Inca Upanqui, and went, wearing my armour.
I found him in the same great chamber as before, only now he was more royally arrayed, and
with him were sundry of his high lords of the Inca blood, also certain priests, among them
the Villaorna Larico.

The old king, who on that day seemed clear in his mind and well, greeted me in his kindly fashion
and bade me set out all that had passed between me and Huaracha in the Chanca camp. This I
did, only I hid from him how great had been the Chanca losses in the battle and how glad they
were to declare a truce and rest.

Upanqui said that the matter should be attended to, speaking in a royal fashion as though it
were one of little moment, which showed me how great an emperor he must be. Great he was, indeed,
seeing that all the broad land of England would have made but one province of his vast dominions,
which in every part were filled with people who, unless they chanced to be in rebellion like
the Yuncas, lived but to do his will.

After this, when I thought the audience was ended, a chamberlain advanced to the foot of the
throne, and kneeling, said that a suppliant prayed speech with the Inca. Upanqui waved his
sceptre, that long staff which I have described, in token that he should be admitted. Then
presently up the chamber came Kari arrayed in the tunic and cloak of an Inca prince, wearing
in his ear a disc carved with the image of the Sun, and a chain of emeralds and gold about
his neck. Nor did he come alone, for he was attended by a brilliant band of those lords and
captains who had deserted to him on the day of the great battle. He advanced and knelt before
the throne.

"Who is this that carries the emblems of the Holy Blood and is clothed like a Prince of the
Sun?" asked Upanqui, affecting ignorance and unconcern, though I saw the colour mount to his
cheeks and the sceptre shake in his withered hand.

"One who is indeed of the holy Inca blood; one sprung from the purest lineage of the Sun,"
answered the stately Kari in his quiet voice.

"How then is he named?" asked the Inca again.

"He is named Kari, first-born son of Upanqui, O Inca."

"Such a son I had once, but he is long dead, or so they told me," said Upanqui in a trembling
voice.

"He is not dead, O Inca. He lives and he kneels before you. Urco poisoned him, but the Sun
his Father recovered him, and the Spirit that is above all gods supported him. The sea bore
him to a far land, where he found a white god who befriended and cared for him," here he turned
his head towards me. "With this god he returned to his own country and here he kneels before
you, O Inca."

"It cannot be," said the Inca. "What sign do you bring who name yourself Kari? Show me the
image of the Spirit above the gods that from his childhood for generations has been hung about
the neck of the Inca's eldest son, born from the Queen."

Kari opened his robe and drew out that golden effigy of Pachacamac which he always wore.

Upanqui examined it, holding it close to his rheumy eyes.

"It seems to be the same," he said, "as I should know upon whose breast it lay until my first
son was born. And yet who can be sure since such things may be copied?"

Then he handed back the image to Kari and after reflecting awhile, said:

"Bring hither the Mother of the Royal Nurses."

Apparently this lady was in waiting, for in a minute she appeared before the throne, an old
and withered woman with beady eyes.

"Mother," said the Inca, "you were with the Coya (that is the Queen) who has been gathered
to the Sun, when her boy was born, and afterwards nursed him for years. If you saw it, would
you know his body again after he has come to middle age?"

"Aye, O Inca."

"How, Mother?"

"By three moles, O Inca, which we women used to call Yuti, Quilla, and Chasca" (that is, the
Sun, the Moon, and the planet Venus), "which were the marks of good fortune stamped by the
gods upon the Prince's back between the shoulders, set one above the other."

"Man who call yourself Kari, are you willing that this old crone should see your flesh?" asked
Upanqui.

By way of answer Kari with a little smile stripped himself of his broidered tunic and other
garments and stood before us naked to the middle. Then he turned his back to the Mother of
the Nurses. She hobbled up and searched it with her bright eyes.

"Many scars," she muttered, "scars in front and scars behind. This warrior has known battles
and blows. But what have we here? Look, O Inca, Yuti, Quilla, and Chasca, set one above the
other, though Chasca is almost hidden by a hurt. Oh! my fosterling, O my Prince whom I nursed
at these withered breasts, are you come back from the dead to take your own again? O Kari of
the Holy Blood; Kari the lost who is Kari the found!"

Then sobbing and muttering she threw her arms about him and kissed him. Nor did he shame to
kiss her in return, there before them all.

"Restore his garments to the royal Prince," said Upanqui, "and bring hither the Fringe that
is worn by the Inca's heir."

It was produced without delay by the high-priest Larico, which told me at once that all this
scene had been prepared. Upanqui took it from Larico, and beckoning Kari to him, with the priest's
help bound it about his brow, thereby acknowledging him and restoring him as heir-apparent
to the Empire. Then he kissed him on the brow and Kari knelt down and did his father homage.

After this they went away together accompanied only by Larico and two or three of the councillors
of Inca blood and as I learned from Larico afterwards, told each other their tales and made
plans to outwit, and if need were to destroy, Urco and his faction.

On the following day Kari was established in a house of his own that was more of a fortress
than a palace, for it was built of great stones with narrow gates, and surrounded by an open
space. Upon this space, as a guard, were encamped all those who had deserted to him in the
battle of the Field of Blood, who had returned to Cuzco from the camp of Huaracha now that
Kari was accepted as the royal heir. Also other troops who were loyal to the Inca were stationed
near by, while those who clung to Urco departed secretly to that town where he lay sick. Moreover,
proclamation was made that on the day of the new moon, which the magicians declared to be auspicious,
Kari would be publicly presented to the people in the Temple of the Sun as the Inca's lawful
heir, in place of Urco disinherited for crimes that he had committed against the Sun, the Empire,
and the Inca his father.

"Brother," said Kari to me, for so he called me now that he was an acknowledged Prince, when
I went to meet him in his grandeur, "Brother, did I not tell you always that we must trust
to our gods? See, I have not trusted in vain though it is true that dangers still lie ahead
of me, and perhaps civil war."

"Yes," I answered, "your gods are in the way of giving you all you want, but it is not so with
mine and me."

"What then do you desire, Brother, who can have even to the half of the kingdom?"

"Kari," I replied, "I cry not for the Earth, but for the Moon."

He understood, and his face grew stern.

"Brother, the Moon alone is beyond you, for she inhabits the sky while you still dwell upon
the earth," he answered with a frown, and then began to talk of the peace with Huaracha.

CHAPTER X

THE GREAT HORROR

The day of the new moon came and with it the great horror that caused all the Empire of Tavantinsuyu
to tremble, fearing lest Heaven should be avenged upon it.

Since Upanqui had found his elder son again he began to dote upon him, as in such a case the
old and weak-minded often do, and would walk about the gardens and palaces with his arm around
his neck babbling to him of whatever was uppermost in his mind. Moreover, his soul was oppressed
because he had done Kari wrong in the past, and preferred Urco to him under the urging of that
prince's mother.

"The truth is, Son," I myself heard him say to Kari, "that we men who seem to rule the world
do not rule it at all, because always women rule us. This they do through our passions which
the gods planted in us for their own ends, also because they are more single in their minds.
The man thinks of many things, the woman only thinks of what she desires. Therefore the man
whom Nature already has bemused, only brings a little piece of his mind to fight against her
whole mind, and so is conquered; he who was made for one thing only, to be the mate of the
woman that she may mother more men in order to serve the wills of other women who yet seem
to be those men's slaves."

"So I have learned, Father," answered the grave Kari, "and for this reason having suffered
in the past, I am determined to have as little to do with women as is possible for one in my
place. During my travels in other lands, as in this country, I have seen men great and noble
brought to nothingness and ruin by their love for women; down into the dirt, indeed, when their
hands were full of the world's wealth and glory. Moreover, I have noticed that they seldom
learn wisdom, and that what they have done before, they are ready to do again, who believe
anything that soft lips swear to them. Yes, even that they are loved for themselves alone,
as I own to my sorrow, once I did myself. Urco could not have taken that fair wife of mine,
Father, if she had not been willing to go when she saw that I had lost your favour and with
it the hope of the Scarlet Fringe."

Here Kari looked at me, of whom I knew he was thinking all this time, and seeing that I could
overhear his talk, began to speak of something else.

On the appointed day there was a great gathering of the nobles of the land, especially of those
of the Inca blood, and of all that were "earmen," a class of the same rank as our peers in
England, to hear the proclamation of Kari as the Inca's heir. It was made before this gorgeous
company in the Great Temple of the Sun, which now I saw for the first time.

It was a huge and most wondrous place well named the "House of Gold." For here everything was
gold. On the western wall hung an image of the Sun twenty feet or more across, an enormous
graven plate of gold set about with gems and having eyes and teeth of great emeralds. The roof,
too, and the walls were all panelled with gold, even the cornices and column heads were of
solid gold.

Opening out of this temple also were others dedicated to the Moon and Stars, that of the Moon
being clothed in silver, with her radiant face shaped in silver fixed to the western wall.
So it was with the temple of the Stars, of the Lightnings and of the Rainbow, which perhaps
with its many colours that sprang from jewels, was the most dazzling of them all.

The sight of so much glory overwhelmed me, and it came into my mind that if only it were known
of in Europe, men would die by the ten thousand on the chance that they might conquer this
country and make its wealth theirs. Yet here, save for these purposes of ornament and to be
used as offerings to the gods and Incas, it was of no account at all.

But in this temple of the Sun was a marvel greater than its gold. For on either side of the
carved likenesses of the sun, seated upon chairs of gold, sat the dead Incas and their queens.
Yes, clothed in their royal robes and emblems, with the Fringe upon their brows, there they
sat with their heads bent forward, so wonderfully preserved by the arts these people have,
that except for the stamp of death upon their countenances, they might have been sleeping men
and women. Thus in the dead face of the mother of Kari I could read her likeness to her son.
Of these departed kings and queens there were many, since from the first Inca of whom history
told all were gathered here in the holy House and under the guardianship of the effigy of their
god, the Sun, from whom they believed themselves to be descended. The sight was so solemn that
it awed me, as it did all that congregation, for I noted that here men walked with unsandalled
feet and that in speaking none raised their voices high.

The old Inca, Upanqui, entered, gloriously apparelled and accompanied by lords and priests,
while after him came Kari with his retinue of great men. The Inca bowed to the company whereon
everyone in the great temple, save myself alone whose British pride kept me on my feet, standing
like one left living on a battlefield among a multitude of slain, prostrated himself before
his divine majesty. At a sign they rose again and the Inca seated himself upon his jewelled
golden throne beneath the effigy of the Sun, while Kari took his place upon a lesser throne
to the Inca's right.

Looking at him there in his splendour on this day when he came into his own again, I bethought
me of the wretched, starving Indian marked with blows and foul with filth whom I had rescued
from the cruel mob upon the Thames-side wharf, and wondered at this enormous change of fortune
and the chain of wonderful events by which it had been brought about.

My fortune also had changed, for then I was great in my own fashion, who now had become but
a wanderer, welcomed indeed in this glittering new world of which yonder we knew nothing, because
I was strange and different, also full of unheard-of learning and skilled in war, but still
nothing but an outcast wanderer, and so doomed to live and die. And as I thought, so thought
Kari, for our glances met, and I read it in his eyes.

Yonder sat my servant who had become my lord, and though he was still my friend, soon I felt
he would be lost in the state matters of that great empire, leaving me more lonely than before.
Also his mind was not as my mind, as his blood was not my blood, and he was the slave of a
faith that to me was a hateful superstition doubtless begotten by the Devil, who under the
name of Cupay, some worshipped in that land, though others declared that this Cupay was the
God of the Dead.

Oh! that I could flee away with Quilla and at her side live out what was left to me of life,
since of all these multitudes she alone understood and was akin to me, because the sacred fire
of love had burned away our differences and opened her eyes. But Quilla was snatched from me
by the law of their accursed faith, and whatever else Kari might give, he would never give
me this lady of the Moon, since, as he had said, to him this would be sacrilege.

The ceremonies began. First Larico, the high-priest of the Sun, clothed in his white sacerdotal
robes, made sacrifice upon a little altar which stood in front of the Inca's throne.

It was a very simple sacrifice of fruit and corn and flowers, with what seemed to be strange-shaped
pieces of gold. At least I saw nothing else, and am sure that nothing that had life was laid
upon that altar after the fashion of the bloody offerings of the Jews, and indeed of those
of some of the other peoples of that great land.

 Urco himself, however, with a number of followers, escaped in boats to the
holy island in the lake.

We built a fleet of balsas with reeds and blown-out sheepskins, and followed him. Landing on
the isle we stormed the city of temples which were more wondrous and even fuller of gold and
precious things than those of Cuzco. Here the men of Urco fought desperately, but driving them
from street to street, at length we penned them in one of the largest of the temples of which
by some mischance a reed roof was set on fire, so that there they perished miserably. It was
a dreadful scene such as I never wish to behold again. Also, after all Urco and some of his
captains, breaking out of the burning temple under cover of the smoke escaped, either in balsas
or, as many declare, by swimming the lake. At least they were gone nor search as we might on
the mainland could they be found.

So all being finished, except for the escape of Urco, we returned to Cuzco which Kari entered
in triumph, I marching at his side, wearied out with war and bloodshed.

CHAPTER XI

THE HOUSE OF DEATH

Now at one time during this long war against Urco victory smiled upon him, though afterwards
the scale went down against him. Kari was defeated in a pitched battle and I who commanded
another army was almost surrounded in a valley. When everything seemed lost, afterwards I escaped
by leading my soldiers round up the slope of a mountain and surprising Urco in the rear, but
as it ended well for us I need not speak of that matter.

It was while all was at its blackest for us that a certain officer was brought to me who was
captured while striving to desert, or at least to pass our outposts. As it happened I knew
this man again having, unseen myself, noted him on the previous day talking earnestly to the
high-priest Larico, who, with other priests, accompanied my army, perhaps to keep a watch on
me. I took this captain apart and questioned him alone, threatening him with death by torment
if he did not reveal his errand to me.

In the end, being very much afraid, he spoke. From him I learned that he was a messenger from
Larico to Urco. Believing that our defeat was almost certain, Larico had sent him to make his
peace with Urco by betraying all Kari's and my own plans to him and revealing how he might
most easily destroy us. He said also that he, Larico, had only joined the party of Upanqui,
and of Kari after him, under threats of death and that always in his heart he had been true
to Urco, whom he acknowledged as his Lord and as the rightful Inca whom he would help to restore
to the Throne with all the power of the Priesthood of the Sun. Further, he sent by this spy
a secret message by means of little cords cunningly knotted, which knots served these people
as writing, since they could read them as we read a book.

Now, being always desirous of knowledge, I had caused myself to be instructed in the plan of
this knot-writing which by this time I could read well enough. Therefore I was able to spell
out this message. It said shortly but plainly, that knowing he still desired her, he, Larico,
as high-priest would hand over to Urco the lady Quilla, daughter to the King of the Chancas
who unlawfully had been hidden away among the Virgins of the Sun, also that he would betray
me, the White-God-from-the-Sea who sought to steal her away, into Urco's hands, that he might
kill me if he could.

When I had mastered all this I was filled with rage and bethought me that I would cause Larico
to be taken and suffer the fate of traitors. Soon, however, I changed this mind of mine and
placing the spy in close keeping where none could come at him, I set a watch on Larico but
said nothing to him or to Kari of all that I had learned.

A few days later our fortunes changed and Urco, defeated, was in full flight to the shores
of Lake Titicaca. After this I knew we had nothing more to fear from this fox-hearted high-priest
who above everything desired to be on the winning side and to continue in his place and power.
So knowing that I held him fast I bided my time, because through him alone I could hope to
come at Quilla. That time came after the war was over and we had returned to Cuzco in triumph.
As soon as the rejoicings were over and Kari was firmly seated on his throne, I sent for Larico,
which, as the greatest man in the kingdom after the Inca, I was able to do.

He appeared in answer to my summons and we bowed to each other, after which he began to praise
me for my generalship, saying that had it not been for me, Urco would have won the war and
that the Inca had done well to name me his Brother before the people and to say that to me
he owed his throne.

"Yes, that is true," I answered, "and now, since through me, you, Larico, are the third greatest
man in the kingdom and remain High-Priest of the Sun and Whisperer in the Inca's ear, I would
put you in mind of a certain bargain that we made when I promised you all these things, Larico."

"What bargain, Lord-of-the-Sea."

"That you would bring me and a Virgin of the Sun, who while she was of the earth was named
Quilla, together, Larico, and enable her to return from those of the Sun to my arms, Larico."

Now his face grew troubled and he answered:

"Lord, I have thought much of this matter, desiring above all things to fulfil my word and
I grieve to tell you that it is impossible."

"Why, Larico?"

"Because I find that the law of my faith is against it, Lord."

"Is that all, Larico?" I asked with a smile.

"No, Lord. Because I find that the Inca would not suffer it and swears to kill all who attempt
to touch the lady Quilla."

"Is that all, Larico?"

"No, Lord. Because I find that a woman who has been betrothed to one of the royal blood may
never pass to another man."

"Now perhaps we come nearer to it, Larico. You mean that if this happened and perchance after
all Urco should come to the throne, as he might do if Kari his brother died--as any man may
die--he would hold you to account."

"Yes, Lord, if that chanced, as chance it may, since Urco still lives and I hear is gathering
new armies among the mountains, certainly he would hold me to account for I have heard as much.
Also our father the Sun would hold me to account and so would the Inca who wields his sceptre
upon earth."

I asked him why he did not think of all these things before when he had much to gain instead
of now when he had gained them through me, and he answered because he had not considered them
enough. Then I pretended to grow angry and exclaimed:

"You are a rogue, Larico! You promise and take your pay and you do not perform. Henceforth
I am your enemy and one to whom the Inca hearkens."

"He hearkens still more to this god the Sun and to me who am the voice of God, White Man,"
he answered, adding insolently, "You would strike too late; your power over me and my fortunes
is gone, White Man."

"I fear it is so," I replied, pretending to be frightened, "so let us say no more of the matter.
After all, there are other women in Cuzco besides this fair bride of the Sun. Now before you
go, High-Priest, will you who are so learned help me who am ignorant? I have been striving
to master your method of conveying thoughts by means of knots. Here I have a bundle of strings
which I cannot altogether understand. Be pleased to interpret them to me, O most holy and upright
High-Priest."

Then from my robe I drew out those knotted fibres that I had taken from his messenger and held
them before Larico's eyes.

He stared at them and turned pale. His hand groped for his dagger till he saw that mine was
on the hilt of Wave-Flame, whereon he let it fall. Next the thought took him that in truth
I could not read the knots which he began to interpret falsely.

"Have done, Traitor," I laughed, "for I know them all. So Urco may wed Quilla and I may not.
Also cease to fret as to that messenger of yours for whom you seek far and near, since he is
safe in my keeping. To-morrow I take him to deliver his message not to Urco, but to Kari--and
then, Traitor?"

Now Larico who, notwithstanding his stern face and proud manner, was a coward at heart, fell
upon his knees before me trembling and prayed me to spare his life which lay in my hand. Well
he knew that if once it came to Kari's ears, even a high priest of the Sun could not hope to
escape the reward of such treachery as his.

"If I pardon you, what will you give me?" I asked.

"The only thing that you will take, Lord--the lady Quilla herself. Hearken, Lord. Outside the
city is the palace of Upanqui whom Urco slew. There in the great hall the divine Inca sits
embalmed and into that holy presence none dare enter save the Virgins of the Sun whose office
it is to wait upon the mighty dead. To-morrow one hour before the dawn, when all men sleep,
I will lead you to this hall disguised in the robes of a priest of the Sun, so that on the
way thither none can know you. There you will find but one Virgin of the Sun, the lady whom
you seek. Take her and begone. The rest I leave to you."

"How do I know that you will not set some trap for me, Larico?"

"Thus, Lord, that I shall be with you and share your sacrilege. Also my life will be in your hand."

"Aye, Larico," I answered grimly, "and if aught of ill befalls me, remember that this," and
I touched the knotted cords, "will find its way to Kari, and with it the man who was your messenger."

He nodded and answered:

"Be sure that I have but one desire, to know you, Lord, and this woman whom, being mad, you
seek so madly, far from Cuzco and never to look upon your face again."

Then we made our plans as to when and where we should meet and other matters, after which he
departed, bowing himself away with many smiles.

I thought to myself that there went as big a rogue as I had ever known, in London or elsewhere,
and fell to wondering what snare he would set for me, since that he planned some snare I was
sure. Why, then, did I prepare to fall into it? I asked myself. The answer was, for a double
reason. First, although my whole heart was sick with longing for the sight of her, now, after
months of seeking, I was no nearer to Quilla than when we had parted in the city of the Chancas,
nor ever should be without Larico's aid. Secondly, some voice within me told me to go forward
taking all hazards, since if I did not, our parting would be for always in this world. Yes,
the voice warned me that unless I saved her soon, Quilla would be no more. As Huaracha had
said, there was more poison in Cuzco, and murderers were not far to seek. Or despair might
do its work with her. Or she might kill herself as once she had proposed to do. So I would
go forward even though the path I walked should lead me to my doom.

That day I did many things. Now, being so great a general and man--or god--among these people,
I had those about me who were sworn to my service and whom I could trust. For one of these,
a prince of the Inca blood, of the House of Kari's mother, I sent and gave to him those knotted
cords that were the proof of Larico's treachery, bidding him if aught of evil overtook me,
or if I could not be found, to deliver them to the Inca on my behalf and with them the prisoned
messenger who was in his keeping, but meanwhile to show them to no man. He bowed and swore
by the Sun to do my bidding, thinking doubtless that, my work finished in this land, I purposed
to return into the sea out of which I had risen, as doubtless a god could do.

Next I summoned the captains of the Chancas who had fought under me throughout the civil war,
of whom about half remained alive, and bade them gather their men upon the ridge where I had
stood at the beginning of the battle of the Field of Blood, and wait until I joined them there.
If it chanced, however, that I did not appear within six days I commanded that they should
march back to their own country and make report to King Huaracha that I had "returned into
the sea" for reasons that he would guess. Also I commanded that eight famous warriors whom
I named, men of my own bodyguard who had fought with me in all our battles and would have followed
me through fire or water or the gates of Hell themselves, should come to the courtyard of my
palace after nightfall, bringing a litter and disguised as its bearers, but having their arms
hidden beneath their cloaks.

These matters settled, I waited upon the Inca Kari and craved of him leave to take a journey.
I told him that I was weary with so much fighting and desired to rest amidst my friends the
Chancas.

He gazed at me awhile, then stretched out his sceptre to me in token that my request was granted,
and said in a sad voice:

"So you would leave me, my brother, because I cannot give you that which you desire. Bethink
you. You will be no nearer to the Moon (by which he meant Quilla) at Chanca than you are at
Cuzco and here, next to the Inca, you are the greatest in the Empire who by decree are named
his brother and the general of his armies."

 After
this I returned to my chamber and waited.

About two hours before the dawn Larico came, knocking on the side-door as we had planned. I
opened to him and he entered disguised in a hooded cloak of sheep's wool which covered his
robes and his face, such as priests wear when the weather is cold. He gave to me the garments
of a priest of the Sun which he had brought with him in a cloth. I clothed myself in them though
because of the fashion of them to do this I must be rid of my armour which would have betrayed
me. Larico desired that I should take off the sword Wave-Flame also, but, mistrusting him,
this I would not do, but made shift to hide it and my dagger beneath the priest's cloak. The
armour I wrapped in a bundle and took with me.

Presently we went out, having spoken few words since the time for speech had gone by and peril
or some fear of what might befall weighed upon our tongues. In the guard-house I found the
Chancas at whom Larico looked curiously but said nothing. To them I gave the bundle of armour
to be hidden in the litter and with it my long bow, having first revealed myself to them by
lifting the hood of my cloak. Then I bade them follow me.

Larico and I walked in front and after us came the eight men, four of them bearing the empty
litter, and the other four marching behind. This was well planned since if any saw us or if
we met guards as once or twice we did, these thought that we were priests taking one who was
sick or dead to be tended or to be made ready for burial. Once, however, we were challenged,
but Larico spoke some word and we passed on without question.

At length in the darkness before the dawn we came to the private palace of dead Upanqui. At
its garden gate Larico would have had me leave the litter with the eight Chanca warriors disguised
as bearers. I refused, saying that they must come to the doors of the palace, and when he grew
urgent, tapped my sword, whispering to him fiercely that he had best beware lest it should
be he who stayed at the gate. Then he gave way and we advanced all of us across the garden
to the door of the palace. Larico unlocked the door with a key and we entered, he and I alone,
for here I bade the Chancas await my return.

We crept down a short passage that was curtained at its end. Passing the curtains I found myself
in Upanqui's banqueting-hall. This hall was dimly lit with one hanging golden lamp. By its
light I saw something more wondrous and of its sort more awful than ever I had seen in that
strange land.

There, on a dais, in his chair of gold, sat dead Upanqui arrayed in all his gorgeous Inca robes
and so marvellously preserved that he might have been a man asleep. With arms crossed and his
sceptre at his side, he sat staring down the hall with fixed and empty eyes, a dreadful figure
of life in death. About him and around the dais were set all his riches, vases and furniture
of gold, and jewels piled in heaps, there to remain till the roof fell in and buried them,
since on this hallowed wealth the boldest dared not lay a hand. In the centre of the hall,
also, was a table prepared as though for feasters, for amid jewelled cups and platters stood
the meats and wines which day by day were brought afresh by the Virgins of the Sun. Doubtless
there were more wonders, but these I could not see because the light did not reach them, or
to the doorways of the chambers that opened from the hall. Moreover, there was something else
which caught my eye.

At the foot of the dais crouched a figure which at first I took to be that of some dead one
also embalmed, perhaps a wife or daughter of the dead Inca who had been set with him in this
place. While I stared at it the figure stirred, having heard our footsteps, rose and turned,
standing so that the light from the hanging lamp fell full upon it. It was Quilla clad in white
and purple with a golden likeness of the Sun blazoned upon her breast!

So beauteous did she look searching the darkness with great blind eyes and her rich flowing
hair flowing from beneath her jewelled headdress, a diadem fashioned to resemble the Sun's
rays, that my breath failed me and my heart stood still.

"There stands she whom you seek," muttered Larico in a mocking whisper, for here even he did
not seem to dare to talk aloud. "Go take her, you whom men call a god, but I call a drunken
fool ready to risk all for a woman's lips. Go take her and ask the blessing upon your kisses
of yonder dead king whose holy rest you break."

"Be silent," I whispered back and passed round the table till I came face to face with Quilla.
Then a strange dumbness fell upon me like a spell or dead Upanqui's curse, so that I could
not speak.

I stood there staring at those beautiful blind eyes and the blind eyes stared back at me. Presently
a look of understanding gathered on the face and Quilla spoke, or rather murmured to herself.

"Strange--but I could have sworn! Strange, but I seemed to feel! Oh! I slept in my vigils upon
that dead old man who in life was so foolish and in death appears to have become so wise, and
sleeping I dreamed. I dreamed I heard a step I shall never hear again. I dreamed one was near
me whom I shall never touch again. I will sleep once more, for in my darkness what are left
to me save sleep and--death?"

Then at last I found my tongue and said hoarsely,

"Love is left, Quilla, and--life."

She heard and straightened herself. Her whole body seemed to become rigid as though with an
agony of joy. Her blind eyes flashed, her lips quivered. She stretched out her hand, feeling
at the darkness. Her fingers touched my forehead, and thence she ran them swiftly over my face.

"It is--dead or living--it is----" and she opened her arms.

Oh! was there ever anything more beautiful on the earth than this sight of the blind Quilla
thus opening her arms to me there in the gorgeous house of death?

We clung and kissed. Then I thrust her away, saying:

"Come swiftly from this ill-omened place. All is ready. The Chancas wait."

She slipped her hand into mine and I turned to lead her away.

Then it was that I heard a low, mocking laugh, Larico's, I thought, heard also a sound of creeping
footsteps around me. I looked. Out of the darkness that hid the doors of the chamber on the
right appeared a giant form which I knew for that of Urco, and behind him others. I looked
to the left and there were more of them, while in front beyond the gold-laid board stood the
traitor, Larico, laughing.

"You have the first fruits, but it seems that another will reap the harvest, Lord-from-the-Sea,"
he jeered.

"Seize her," cried Urco in his guttural voice, pointing to Quilla with his mace, "and brain
that white thief."

I drew Wave-Flame and strove to get at him, but from both sides men rushed in on me. One I
cut down, but the others snatched Quilla away. I was surrounded, with no room to wield my sword,
and already weapons flashed over me. A thought came to me. The Chancas were at the door. I
must reach them, for perhaps so Quilla might be saved. In front was the table spread for the
death feast. With a bound I leapt on to it, shouting aloud and scattering its golden furnishings
this way and that. Beyond stood the traitor, Larico, who had trapped me--I sprang at him and
lifting Wave-Flame with both hands I smote with all my strength. He fell, as it seemed to me,
cloven to the middle. Then some spear cast at me struck the lamp.

It shattered and went out!

CHAPTER XII

THE FIGHT TO THE DEATH

There was tumult in the hall; shoutings, groans from him whom I had first struck down, the
sound of vases and vessels overthrown, and above all those of a woman's shrieks echoing from
the walls and roof, so that I could not tell whence they came.

Through the gross darkness I went on towards the curtains, or so I hoped. Presently they were
torn open, and by the faint light of the breaking dawn I saw my eight Chancas rushing towards me.

"Follow!" I cried, and at the head of them groped my way back up the hall, seeking for Quilla.
I stumbled over the dead body of Larico and felt a path round the table. Then suddenly a door
at the back of the hall was thrown open and by the grey light which came through the doorway
I perceived the last of the ravishers departing. We scrambled across the dais where the golden
chair was overthrown and the embalmed Upanqui lay, a stiff and huddled heap upon his back,
staring at me with jewelled eyes.

We gained the door which, happily, none had remembered to close, and passed out into the parklike
grounds beyond. A hundred paces or more ahead of us, by the glowing light, I saw a litter passing
between the trees surrounded by armed men, and knew that in it was Quilla being borne to captivity
and shame.

After it we sped. It passed the gate of the park wall, but when we reached that gate it was
shut and barred and we must waste time breaking it down, which we did by help of a felled tree
that lay at hand. We were through it, and now the rim of the sun had appeared so that through
the morning mist, which clung to the hillside beyond the town, we could see the litter, the
full half of a mile away. On we went up the hill, gaining as we ran, for we had no litter to
bear, nor aught else save the sack of armour which one of the Chancas had thought to bring
with him when he rushed into the hall, and with it my long bow and shaft.

Now, at a certain place between this hill and another there was a gorge such as are common
in that country, a gorge so deep and narrow that in places the light of day scarcely struggles
to the pathways at its bottom. Into this tunnel the litter vanished and when we drew near I
saw that its mouth was held by armed men, six of them or more. Taking my bow from the Chanca
I strung it and shot swiftly. The man at whom I aimed went down. Again I shot and another fell,
whereon the rest of them took cover behind stones.

Throwing back the bow to the Chanca, for now it was useless, we charged. That business was
soon over, for presently all those of Urco's men who remained there were dead, save one who,
being cut off, fled down hill towards the city, taking with him the news of what had passed
in the palace of dead Upanqui.

We entered the mouth of the gorge, plunging towards the gloom, though as it chanced this place
faced towards the east, so that the low sun, which now was fully up, shone down it and gave
us light that later would have been lacking.

I, who was very swift of foot and to whom rage and fear gave wings, outran my companions. Swinging
myself round a rock which lay in the pathway, I saw the litter again not a hundred yards ahead.
It halted because, as it seemed to me, one or more of the bearers stumbled and fell among the
stones. I rushed at them, roaring. Perhaps it had been wiser to wait for my companions, but
I was mad and feared nothing. They saw me and a cry went up of:

"The White God! The terrible White God!"

Then fear took hold of them and they fled, leaving the litter on the ground. Yes, all of them
fled save one, Urco himself.

He stood there rolling his eyes and gnashing his teeth, looking huge and awful in those shadows,
looking like a devil from hell. Suddenly a thought seemed to take him, and leaping at the litter
he tore aside its curtains and dragged out Quilla, who fell prone upon the ground.

"If I may not have her, you shall not, White Thief. See! I give back his bride to the Sun,"
he shouted, and lifted his copper sword to pierce her through.

Now I was still ten paces or so away and saw that before I could reach him that sword would
be in her heart. What could I do? Oh! St. Hubert must have helped me then for I knew in an
instant. In my hand was Wave-Flame and with all my strength I hurled it at his head.

The great blade hurtled hissing through the air. I saw the sunlight shine on it. He strove
to leap clear, but too late, for it caught him on the hand that he had lifted to protect his
head, and shore off two of his fingers so that he dropped his sword. Next instant, still roaring,
as doubtless old Thorgrimmer, my forefather, used to do when he fought to the death, for blood
is very strong, I leapt on the giant, who like myself was swordless. There in the gulf we wrestled.
He was a mighty man, but now my strength was as that of ten. I threw him to the ground by a
Sussex trick I knew and there we rolled over and over each other. Once he had me undermost
and I think would have choked me, had it not been that his right hand lacked two fingers.

With a mighty heave I lifted him so that now we lay side by side. He was groping for a knife--I
did not see, but knew it. Near his head a sharp-edged stone rose in the path to the height
of a man's hand or more. I saw it and bethought me what to do if I could. Again I heaved and
as at length he found the knife and stabbed at me, scratching my face, I got his bull's neck
upon that stone. Then I loosed my hand and caught him by the hair. Back I pressed his great
head, back and back with all my might till something snapped.

Urco's neck was broken. Urco quivered and was dead!

I lay by his side, panting. A voice came from the white heap upon the ground by whom and for
whom this dreadful combat had been fought, the voice of Quilla.

"One died, but who lives?" asked the voice.

I could not answer because I had no breath. All my strength was gone. Still I sat up, supporting
myself with my hand and hoping that it would come back. Quilla turned her face towards me,
or rather towards the sound that I had made in moving, and I thought to myself how sad it was
that she should be blind. Presently she spoke again and now her voice quavered:

"I see who it is that lives," she said. "Something has broken in my eyes and, Lord and Love,
I see that it is you who live. You, you, and oh! you bleed."

Then the Chancas came bounding down the gorge and found us.

"And thus delivered me from a traitor, as I have learned also from your messenger who handed
to me the knotted cord, and from the spy whom you had in your keeping. I repeat that you are
the most daring among men and the first among warriors; almost a god as my people name you."

I bowed, and after a little silence he went on:

"Would that this were all that I have to say. But alas! it is not. You have committed the great
sacrilege against the Sun, my father, of which I warned you, having robbed him of his bride,
and, my brother, you have lied to me, who told me but yesterday that you had put all thought
of her from your mind."

"To me that was no sacrilege, Kari, but rather a righteous deed, to free one from the bonds
of a faith in which neither she nor I believe, and to lead her from a living tomb back to life
and love."

"And was the lie righteous also, Brother?"

"Aye," I answered boldly, "if ever a lie can be. Bethink you. You prayed that this lady might
die because she came between you and me, and those that kings pray may die, do die, if not
with their knowledge or by their express command. Therefore I said that I had put her from
my mind in order that she might go on living."

"To cherish you in her arms, Brother. Now hearken. Because of this deed of yours, we who were
more than friends have become more than foes. You have declared war upon my god and me; therefore
I declare war upon you. Yet hearken again. I do not wish that thousands of men should perish
because of our quarrel. Therefore I make an offer to you. It is that you should fight me here
and now, man to man, and let the Sun, or Pachacamac beyond the Sun, decide the matter as may
be decreed."

"Fight you! Fight you Kari, the Inca," I gasped.

"Aye, fight me to the death, since between us all is over and done. In England you nurtured
me. Here in the land of Tavantinsuyu, which I rule to-day, I have nurtured you, and in my shadow
you have grown great, though it is true that had it not been for your generalship, perchance
I should no longer be here to throw the shadow. Let us therefore set the one thing against
the other and, forgetting all between us that is past, stand face to face as foes. Mayhap you
will conquer me, being so mighty a man of war. Mayhap, also, if that chances, my people who
look upon you as half a god will raise you up to be Inca after me, should such be your desire."

"It is not," I broke in.

"I believe you," he answered, bowing his head, "but will it not be the desire of that fair-faced
harlot who has betrayed our Lord the Sun?"

At this word I started and bit my lip.

"Ah! that stings you," he went on, "as the truth always stings, and it is well. Understand,
White Lord who were once my brother, that either you must fight me to the death, or I declare
war upon you and upon the Chanca people, which war I will wage from month to month and from
year to year until you are all destroyed, as destroyed you shall be. But should you fight and
should the Sun give me the victory, then justice will be accomplished and I will keep the peace
that I have sworn with the Chanca people. Further, should you conquer me, in the name of my
people I swear that there shall still be peace between them and the Chancas, since I shall
have atoned your sacrilege with my blood. Now summon those lords of yours and I will summon
mine, and set out the matter to them."

So I turned and beckoned to my captains, and Kari beckoned to his. They came, and in the hearing
of all, very clearly and quietly as was his fashion, he repeated every word that he had said
to me, adding to them others of like meaning. While he spoke I thought, not listening over-much.

This thing was hateful to me, yet I was in a snare, since according to the customs of all these
peoples I could not refuse such a challenge and remain unshamed. Moreover, it was to the advantage
of the Chancas, aye, and of the Quichuas also, that I should not refuse it seeing that whether
I lived or died, peace would then reign between them who otherwise must both be destroyed by
war. I remembered how once Quilla had sacrificed herself to prevent such a war, though in the
end that war had come; and what Quilla had done, should I not do also? Weary though I was I
did not fear Kari, brave and swift as he might be, indeed I thought that I could kill him and
perhaps take his throne, since the Quichuas worshipped me, who so often had led their armies
to triumph, almost as much as did the Chancas. But--I could not kill Kari. As soon would I
kill one born of my own mother. Was there then no escape?

The answer rose in my mind. There was an escape. I could suffer Kari to kill me. Only if I
did this, what of Quilla! After all that had come and gone, must I lose Quilla thus, and must
Quilla lose me? Surely she would break her heart and die. My plight was desperate. I knew not
what to do. Then of a sudden, while I wavered, some voice seemed to whisper in my ear; I thought
it must be that of St. Hubert. It seemed to say to me, "Kari trusts to his god, cannot you
trust to yours, Hubert of Hastings, you who are a Christian man? Go forward, and trust to yours,
Hubert of Hastings."

Kari's gentle voice died away; he had finished his speech and all men looked at me.

"What word?" I said roughly to my captains.

"Only this, Lord," answered their spokesman, "Fight you must, of that there can be no doubt,
but we would fight with you, the ten of the Chancas against the ten of the Quichuas."

"Aye, that is good," replied the first of Kari's nobles. "This business is too great to set
upon one man's skill and strength."

"Have done!" I said. "It lies between the Inca and myself," while Kari nodded, and repeated
"Have done!" after me.

Then I sent one of the captains back to the camp for my sword and Kari commanded that his should
be brought to him, since according to the custom of these people when ambassadors meet, neither
of us was armed. Presently, the captain holding my sword returned, and with him servants who
brought my armour. Also after them streamed all the army of the Chancas among whom the news
had spread like wind-driven fire, and lined themselves upon the ridge to watch. As he came,
too, I noticed that this captain sharpened Wave-Flame with a certain kind of stone that was
used to give a keen edge to weapons.

He brought the ancient weapon and handed it to me on his knee. The Inca's man also brought
his sword and handed it to him, as he did so, bowing his forehead to the dust. Well I knew
that weapon, since once before I had faced it in desperate battle for my life. It was the ivory-handled
sword of the lord Deleroy which Kari had taken from his dead hand after I slew him in the Solar
of my house in the Cheap at London. Then the servant came to me with the armour, but I sent
him away, saying that as the Inca had none, I would not wear it, at which my people murmured.

Kari saw and heard.

"Noble as ever," he said aloud. "Oh! that such bright honour should have been tarnished by
a woman's breath."

Our lords discussed the manner of our fighting, but to them I paid little heed.

At length all was ready and we stepped forward to face each other at a given word, clad much
alike. I had thrown off my outer garment and stood bareheaded in a jerkin of soft sheepskin.
Kari, too, was stripped of his splendid dress and clad in a tunic of sheepskin. Also, that
we might be quite equal, he had taken off his turban-like headgear and even the royal Fringe,
whereat his lords stared at each other for they thought this a bad omen.

It was just then I heard a sound behind me, and turning my head I saw Quilla stumbling towards
us down the stony slope as best her half-blind eyes would let her, and crying as she came:

"Oh! my Lord, fight not. Inca, I will return to the House of the Sun!"

"Silence, accursed woman!" said Kari, frowning. "Does the Sun take back such as you? Silence
until the woe that you have wrought is finished, and then wail on forever."

She shrank back at his bitter, unjust words, and guided by the women who had followed her,
sank upon a stone, where she sat still as a statue or as dead Upanqui in his hall.

Now one called aloud the pledges of the fight which were as Kari had spoken them. He listened
and added:

"Be it known, also, that this battle is to the death of one or both of us, since if we live
I take back my oaths and I will burn yonder witch as a sacrifice to the Sun whom she has betrayed,
and destroy her people and her city according to the ancient law of Vengeance on the House
of those who have deceived the Sun."

I heard but made no answer, who did not wish to waste my breath in bandying words with a great
man, whose brain had been turned by bigotry and woman-hatred.

A moment later the signal was given and we were at it. Kari leapt at me like the tree-lion
of his own forests, but I avoided and parried. Thrice he leapt and thrice I did this; yes,
even when I saw an opening and might have cut him down. Almost I struck, then could not. The
Chancas watched me, wondering what game I played who was not wont to fight in this fashion,
and I also wondered, who still knew not what to do. But there are you followed with danger to Leading?

"Every

 Nor will I suffer you to be given up who have done no wrong, since it was
I who took you away by force, as Urco would have done. Kari, hearken to me. Not once only when
we were in danger together in past days have you said to me that we must put our faith in the
gods we worship, and thus we did. Now again I hearken to that counsel of yours and put my faith
in the God I worship. You threaten to gather all the strength of your mighty empire, and because
of what I hold to be your superstitions, to destroy the Chanca people to the last babe and
to level their city to the last stone. I do not believe that the God I worship will suffer
this to come about, though how he will stay your vengeance I do not know. Kari, great Inca
of Tavantinsuyu, Lord of all this strange new world, I, the White Wanderer-from-the-Sea, give
you your life and save you as once before I saved you in a far land, and with your life I give
you my blessing in all matters but this one alone. Kari, my brother, look your last on me and
go in peace."

The Inca heard, and raising his head, stared at me with his fine, melancholy eyes. Then suddenly
from those eyes there came a gush of tears. More, he knelt before me and kissed the ground,
as the humblest of his slaves might do before his own majesty.

"Most noble of men," he said, lifting himself up again, "I worship you. Yes, I, the Inca, worship
you. Would that I might take back my oath, but this I cannot do because my god hardens my heart
and then would decree destruction on my people. Mayhap he whom you serve will bring things
to pass as you foretell, as it would seem he has brought it to pass that I should eat the dust
before you. I hope that it may be so who love not the sight of blood, but who like the shot

If he led his death, his face, moulded there in official, and famous lines of his habits from thought,
was softened as where to regret. The three men stumbled myself to silence, or both been patient
turned to then with Chancas.

"he received between mother and his mistress," he took.
 Yet all this while strength and sight were returning
to her eyes, so that in the end she could see as well as ever she had done, for which I thanked
Heaven.

Messengers had gone before us, so that when we drew near all the people of the Chancas came
out to meet us, a mighty multitude, who spread flowers before us and sang songs of joy. On
the same evening I was summoned by Huaracha and found him dying. There in the presence of his
chief captains Quilla and I told him all our story, to which he listened, answering nothing.
When it was finished he said:

"I thank you, Lord-from-the-Sea, who through great perils have saved my daughter and brought
her home to bid farewell to me, untarnished as she went. I understand now that it was an evil
policy which led me to promise her in marriage to the prince Urco. Through your valour it has
come to naught and I am glad. Great dangers still lie ahead of you and of my people. Deal with
them as you will and can, for henceforward, Lord-from-the-Sea, they are your people, yours
and my daughter's together, since it is my desire and command that you two should wed so soon
as I am laid with my fathers. Perchance it had been better if you had slain the Inca when he
was in your hand, but man goes where his spirit leads him. My blessing and the blessing of
my gods be on you both and on your children. Leave me, for I can say no more."

That night King Huaracha died.

Three days later he was buried with great pomp beneath the floor of the Temple of the Moon,
not being preserved and kept above ground after the fashion of the Incas.

On the last day of the mourning a council was summoned of all the great ones in the country
to the number of several hundreds, to which I was bidden. This was done in the name of Quilla,
who was now named by a title which meant, "High Lady," or "Queen." I went to it eagerly enough
who had seen nothing of her since that night of her father's death, for, according to the custom
of this people, she had spent the time of mourning alone with her women.

To my surprise I was led by an officer, not into the great hall where I knew the notables were
assembling, but to that same little chamber where first I had talked with Huaracha, Quilla's
father. Here the officer left me wondering. Presently I heard a sound and looking up, saw Quilla
herself standing between the curtains, like to a picture in its frame. She was royally arrayed
and wore upon her brow and breast the emblem of the moon, so that she seemed to glitter in
that dusky place, though nothing about her shone with such a light as did her large and doe-like
eyes.

"Greeting, my Lord," she said in her soft voice, curtseying to me as she spoke. "Has my Lord
aught to say to me? If so, it must be quick, since the Great Council waits."

Now I grew foolish and tongue-tied, but at length stammered out:

"Nothing, except what I have said before--that I love you."

She smiled a little in her slow fashion, then asked:

"Is there naught to add?"

"What can there be to add to love, Quilla?"

"I know not," she answered, still smiling. "Yet in what does the love of man and woman end?"

I shook my head and answered:

"In many things, all of them different. In hell sometimes, and more rarely in heaven."

"And on earth which lies between the two, should those who love escape death and separation?"

"Well, on earth--in marriage."

She looked at me again and this time a new light shone in her eyes which I could not misinterpret.

"Do you mean that you will marry me, Quilla?" I muttered.

"Such was my father's wish, Lord, but what is yours? Oh! have done," she went on in a changed
voice. "For what have we suffered all these things and gone through such long partings and
dangers so dreadful? Was it not that if Fate should spare us we might come together at last?
And has not Fate spared us--for a while? What said the prophecy of me in the Temple of Rimac?
Was it not that the Sun should be my refuge and--I forget the rest."

"I remember it," I said. "That in the beloved arms you should sleep at last."

"Yes," she went on, the blood mounting to her cheeks, "that in the beloved arms I should sleep
at last. So, the first part of the prophecy has come true."

"As the rest shall come true," I broke in, awaking, and swept her to my breast.

"Are you sure," she murmured presently, "that you love me, a woman whom you think savage, well
enough to wed me?"

"Aye, more than sure," I answered.

"Hearken, Lord. I knew it always, but being woman I desired to hear it from your own lips.
Of this be certain: that though I am but what I am, a maiden, wild-hearted and untaught, no
man shall ever have a truer and more loving wife. It is my hope, even that my love will be
such that in it at last you may learn to forget that other lady far away who once was yours,
if only for an hour."

Now I shrank as from a sword prick, since first loves, whatever the tale of them, as Quilla
guessed or Nature taught her, are not easily forgot, and even when they are dead their ghosts
will rise and haunt us.

"And my hope, most dear, is that you will be mine, not for an hour but for all our life's days,"
I answered.

"Aye," she said, sighing, "but who knows how many these will be? Therefore let us pluck the
flowers before they wither. I hear steps. The lords come to summon us. Be pleased to enter
the Council at my side and holding me by the hand. There I have somewhat to say to the people.
The shadow of the Inca Kari, whom you spared, still lies cold upon us and them."

Before I could ask her meaning the lords entered, three of them, and glancing at us curiously,
said that all were gathered. Then they turned and went before us to the great hall where every
place was filled. Hand in hand we mounted the dais, and as we came all the audience rose and
greeted us with a roar of welcome.

Quilla seated herself upon a throne and motioned to me to take my place upon another throne
at her side, which I noted stood a little higher than that on which she sat, and this, as I
learned afterwards, not by chance. It was planned so to tell the people, of the Chancas that
henceforth I was their king while she was but my wife.

When the shouting had died away Quilla rose from her throne and began to speak, which like
many of the higher class of this people she could do well enough.

"Lords and Captains of the Chanca nation," she said, "my father, the king Huaracha, being dead,
leaving no lawful son, I have succeeded to his dignities, and summoned you here to take counsel
with me.

"First, learn this, that I, your Queen and Lady, have been chosen as wife by him who sits at
my side."

Here the company shouted again, thus announcing that this tidings pleased them. For though
by now only the common people still believed me to be a god risen from the sea, all held that
I was a great general and a great man, one who knew much that they did not know, and who could
both lead and fight better than the best of them. Indeed, since I had slain Urco with my hands
and overcome Kari, who as Inca was believed to be clothed with the strength of the Sun and
therefore unconquerable, I was held to be unmatched throughout Tavantinsuyu. Moreover, the
army that had fought under my command loved me as though I were their father as well as their
general. Therefore all greeted this tidings well enough without astonishment, for they knew
it was their dead king's wish that I should wed his daughter and that to win her I had gone
through much.

In answer to their shoutings I, too, rose from my seat, and drawing the sword Wave-Flame, which
I wore girt about my dinted armour, with it I saluted first Quilla and then the gathered nobles,
saying:

"Lords of the Chancas, when on an island in the sea, my eyes fell upon this lady who to-day
is your queen, I loved her and swore that I would wed her if I might. Between that day and
this much has befallen. She was snatched away to be made the wife of Urco, heir to the Inca
throne, and afterwards, to escape him whom she hated, she took refuge in the House of the Inca
god. Then, people of the Chancas, came the great war which we shared together, and in the end
I rescued her from that house of bondage, and slew Urco while he strove to steal or stab her.
This done, I conquered Kari the Inca, who was as my brother, yet because I saved your lady
from his god the Sun, became my enemy, and together she and I returned to this, her land. Now
it is her will to wed me, as it has always been mine to wed her, and here in front of all of
you I take her to wife, as she takes me to husband, hoping that for many years it may be given
to us to rule over you, and to our children after us. Yet I warn you that although in the great
war that has been, if with much loss, we have held our own against all the hosts of Cuzco and
won an honourable peace, by this marriage of ours, which robs the Inca god of one of a thousand
brides, that peace is broken. Therefore in the future, as in the past, there will be war between
the Quichua and the Chanca peoples."

"We know it," shouted the nobles. "War is decreed, let war come!"

"What would you have had me do?" I went on. "Leave your queen to languish in the House of the
Sun, wed to nothingness, or suffer her to be dragged away to be one of Urco's women, or hand
her back to Kari to be slain as a sacrifice to a god whom you do not accept?"

"Nay!" they cried. "We would have her wed you, White Lord-from-the-Sea, that she may become
a mother of kings."

"So I thought, Chancas. Yet I warn you that there is trouble near. The storm gathers and soon
it will burst, since Kari is not one who breaks his oaths."

"Why did you not kill him when he was in your hand, and take his throne?" asked one.

"Because I could not. Because it would not have been pleasing to Heaven that I should slay
a man who for years had been as my brother. Because in this way or in that the deed would have
fallen back upon my head, upon the head of the lady Quilla, and upon your heads also, O people
of the Chancas, because----"

At this moment there was disturbance at the end of the hall, and a herald cried:

"An embassy! An embassy from Kari, the Inca."

"Let it be admitted," said Quilla.

Presently up the central passage marched the embassy with pomp, great lords and "earmen," every
man of them, and bowed before us.

"Your words?" said Quilla quietly.

"They are these, Lady," answered the spokesman of the party. "For the last time the Inca demands
that you should surrender yourself to be sacrificed as one who has betrayed the Sun. He asks
it of you since he has learned that your father Huaracha is no more."

"And if I refuse to surrender myself, what then, O Ambassador?"

"Then in the name of the Empire and in his own name the Inca declares war upon you, war to
the end, until not one of Chanca blood is left living beneath the sun and not one stone marks
where your city stood. It may be that a while will pass before this sword of war falls upon
your head, since the Inca must gather his armies and give a breathing space to his peoples
after all the troubles that have been. Yet if not this year, then next year, and if not next
year, then the year after, that sword shall fall."

Quilla listened and turned pale, though more, I think, with wrath than fear. Then she said:

"You have heard, Chancas, and know how stands this case. If I surrender myself to be sacrificed,
the Inca in his mercy will spare you; if I do not surrender myself, soon or late he will destroy
you--if he can. Say, then, shall I surrender myself?"

Now every man in that great hall leapt up and from every throat there arose a shout of,

"Never!"

When it had died away an aged chief and councillor, an uncle of Huaracha, the dead King, came
forward and stared at the envoys with his horny eyes.

"Go back to the Inca," he said, "and tell him that the threats of the mouth are one thing and
the deeds of the hand are another. In the late war that has been he has learned something of
our quality, both as foes and friends, and perchance more remains for him to learn. Yonder
is one"--and he pointed to myself--"who is about to become our King and the husband of our
Queen. As he said his bosom that you came red face within we. Kari force, of whom wholly leading

 That king,
it is said, had two sons, and when he died these sons made war upon each other, and one of
them, my forefather, was defeated and driven away into the forests by those who clung to him.
By boats he descended the river that runs through the forest, and at length with those who
remained to him came to this land and there once more grew to be a king. Is it not so?"

"It is so," answered the aged chief. "The tale has come down to me through ten generations,
and with it the prophecy that in a day to come the Chancas would return to that City of Gold
whence they came and be welcomed of its people."

"I have heard that prophecy," said Quilla. "Moreover, of it I have something to tell you. While
I sat in despair and blindness in the Convent of the Sun at Cuzco it came into my mind and
I brooded upon it much, who was always sure that the war between the Chancas and the armies
of the Incas was but begun. In my darkness I prayed to my Mother, the Moon, for light and help.
Long and often I prayed, and at length an answer came. One night the Spirit of the Moon appeared
to my soul as a beautiful and shining goddess, and spoke to me.

"'Be brave, Daughter,' she said, 'for all that seems to be lost shall yet be found again, and
the light of a certain flashing sword shall pierce the blackness and give back vision to your
eyes.' This, indeed, happened, my people, since it was when the sword of my Lord saved me from
death at the hands of Urco that the first gleam of light returned to my darkened eyes.

"'Be not afraid, moreover, for the Children of the Chancas who bow to me,' went on the shining
Spirit of the Moon, 'since in the day of their danger I will show them a path towards my place
of resting in the west. Yea, I will lead them far from wars and tyrannies back to that ancient
city whence they came, and there they shall sleep in peace till all things are accomplished.
Moreover, you shall be their ruler during your appointed days, you and another whom I led to
you out of the deeps of the sea and showed to you sleeping in my beams.'

"Thus that Spirit spoke to me, Councillors, though at the time I did not know whether the vision
were more than a happy dream. But now I do know that it was no dream, but the truth.

"For did not my sight begin to return to me in the flashing of the sword that is named Flame-of-the-Wave?
And if this were true, why should not the rest be true also? People of the Chancas, I am your
Queen to-day and my counsel to you is that we flee from this land before the Inca's net closes
round us and the Inca's spears pierce our heart, to seek our ancient home far in the depths
of the western forest where, as I trust, his armies cannot come. Is that your will, O my People?
If so, by the tongues of your Lords and Captains declare it here and now before it be too late."

Back thundered the answer:

"It is our will, O Daughter of the Moon!"

When its echoes had died away Quilla turned to me, lovely to look on as the evening star and
with eyes that shone like stars, and asked:

"Is it your will also, O Lord-from-the-Sea?"

"Your will is my will, Quilla," I answered, "and your heart is my home. Lead on; where you
go I follow, even to the edge of the world and beyond the world."

"So be it!" she cried in a triumphant voice. "Now the evil past is finished with its fears
and battles and before our feet, lit by moonbeams, stretches the Future's shining road leading
us to the mystery in which all roads begin and for an hour are lost again. Now, too, our separations
end in a perfect unity that perchance we have known before and shall know again in ages to
be born and lands revisited. Now, Lord-from-the-Sea, at whose coming my sleeping heart awoke
to love and whose sword saved me from shame and death, giving me back to life and light, here,
before this company of our people, I, the Daughter of the Moon, defying the Sun who held me
captive, and all his servants, take you to husband with this kiss," and leaning forward Quilla
pressed her lips upon my own. . . .

     rotted with the damp of the tomb in which it lay for centuries
