 But he chose his path, he denied
his Lord, and he is lost. And now, dear madam, place your affections on your living son, who
is, thank God, saved." That was the comfort he brought her. That was the consolation of his
religion. I am telling you of an actual occurrence. This is all a fact. Well, a few years later
that dear old lady died in her son's house, where she had gone on a visit. He broke her will--this
son who was saved--and brought in a bill against her estate for her board and nursing while
she was ill! Which one of those boys do you think would be the best company for her in the
next world?

It has always seemed to me that I would rather go to hell with a good son than to heaven with
a good Christian. I may be wrong, but with my present light that is the way it looks to me;
and for the sake of humanity I am glad that it looks that way.

ACCIDENT INSURANCE.

A church member said to me some time ago that even though the Bible were not "the word of God,"
even though it were not necessary to believe in the creed in order to go to heaven, it could
not do any harm to believe it; and he thought it was "best to be on the safe side, for," said
he, "suppose after all it should happen to be true!"

So he carries a church-membership as a sort of accident insurance policy.

I do not believe we have a right to work upon that basis. It is not honest. I do not believe
that any "suppose it should be" gives us the right to teach "I know that it is." I do not believe
in the honesty and right of any cause that has to prop up its backbone with faith, and splinter
its legs with ignorance. I do not believe in the harmlessness of any teaching that is not based
upon reason, justice, and truth. I do not believe that it is harmless to uphold any religion
that is not noble and elevating in itself. I do not believe that it is "just as well" to spread
any dogma that stultifies reason and ignores common-sense. I do not believe that it is ever
well to compromise with dishonesty and pretence. And I cannot admit that it "can do no harm"
to teach a belief in the goodness of a God who sends an Emerson or a Darwin to hell because
Eve was fond of fruit, and who offers a reserved seat in heaven to Christine Cox because a
mob murdered Jesus Christ. It does not seem to me good morals, and it is certainly poor logic.

And speaking of logic, I heard a funny story the other day about one of those absurdly literal
little girls who, when she heard people say they "wanted to be an angel," did not know it was
a joke.. She thought it was all honor-bright. She was standing by the window killing flies,
and her mother called her and said, "My child, don't you know that is very wicked? Don't you
know that God made those dear little flies, and that he loves them?" (Just imagine an infinite
God in love with a blue-bottle fly!) Well, the little girl thought that was queer taste, but
she was sorry, and said that she would not do it any more. By and by, however, a great lazy
fly was too tempting, and her plump little finger began to follow him around slowly on the
glass, and she said, "Oh you nice big fly, did dod made you? And does dod love you? And does
you love dod?" (Down came the finger.) "Well, you shall see him."

Yet we all know Christians who love God better than anything else--"with all their hearts and
soul and strength"--who prefer to postpone seeing him till the very last minute. They say it
is because they have not "fulfilled their allotted time." Why not be honest and say it is because
they like to live? They "long to put on immortality;" but their sleep is sounder if they live
next door to a good doctor.

People say that men are infidels because it is easier--to rid themselves of responsibility.
But it seems to me that anyone who advances the doctrine of "morality and works" instead of
that of "repentance and faith," on the ground that it is easier, is laboring under a mistake.
I don't see how any one could ask for an easier way of getting rid of his sins than the plan
that simply unloads them on to another man. I fail to see anything hard about that--except
for the man who catches the load; and I am unable to see anything commendable about it either.
But it is not always easy for a man to be brave enough to be responsible for his own mistakes
or faults. It is not always easy for a man to say "I did it, and I will suffer the penalty."
That is not always easy, but it is always just. No one but a coward or a knave needs to shift
his personal responsibility on to the shoulders of the dead. Honest men and women do not need
to put "Providence" up between themselves and their own motives.

A short time ago the wife of a very devout man apparently died, but her body remained so lifelike
and her color so natural that her relatives decided that she could not be dead, and they summoned
a physician. The husband, however, refused to have him administer any restoratives. He said
that if the Lord had permitted her to go into a trance and was anxious to bring her out alive
he would do it. Meanwhile he did not intend to meddle with Providence. His maxim was, "Whatever
else you do, don't interfere with Providence. Give Providence a good chance and if it doesn't
come round all right for Betsy, I think I can bear it--and she will have to."

If we take care of our motives toward each other, "Providence" will take care of itself.

Did you ever know a pious man do a real mean thing--that succeeded--who did not claim that
Providence had a finger in it? The smaller the trick, the bigger the finger. He is perfectly
honest in his belief too. He is the sort of man that never has a doubt about hell--and that
most people go there. Thinks they all deserve it. Has entire confidence that God is responsible
for every word in the Bible, and that all other Bibles and all other religions are the direct
work of the devil. Probably prays for people who don't believe that way. He is perfectly honest
in it. That is simply his size, and he usually pities anybody who wears a larger hat.

CHIEFLY WOMEN.

But they say this is not a matter of reason. This is outside of reason, it is all a matter
of faith. But whenever a superstition claims to be so holy that you must not use your reason
about it, there is something wrong some place. Truth is not afraid of reason, nor reason of truth.

I am going to say something to-night about why I do not believe in a religion of faith. I am
going to tell you some of the reasons why I do not believe that the Bible is "inspired;" why
I, as a woman, don't want to think it is the word of God; why I think that women, above all
others, should not believe that it is. And since women are the bulwarks of the churches to-day,
it seems to me they have the right, and that it is a part of their duty, to ask themselves
why. Since about seven-tenths of all church-members are women, surely the churches should not
deny them the right to use their reason (or whatever serves them in that capacity) in regard
to their own work.

 When you go to rob and murder a man, just tell him to keep
cool and behave like a gentleman and you won't do a thing to him but steal all his property
and cut his throat and retire in good order, God always seemed to fight on the side of the
man who would murder most of his fellow-men and degrade the greatest number of women. He seemed,
in fact, to rather insist on this point if he was particular about nothing else. And, by the
way, if you had happened to live in one of those cities, what opinion do you think you would
have had of Jehovah? Would he have impressed you as a loving Father? Here we have 2 Samuel
v. 10, 12-13:

     10 And David went on, and grew great, and the Lord God of
     hosts was with him.

The nearer he got to God--the more God was "with him," the more wives he wanted. Next we have
2 Samuel xx.

Now what did David do that for? I don't know. It was such a trifling little matter that it
was not thought necessary to give any reason. Perhaps he had eaten too much pie and felt cross;
and what else were those women for but to be made stand around on such occasions? Weren't they
his property? Didn't those ten women belong to David? Hadn't he a perfect right to shut them
up and feed them if he wanted to? Don't you think it was kind of him to feed them? I wonder
if he sang any of his psalms to them through the key-hole. His son Absalom had just been killed,
and he felt miserable about that. And I haven't a doubt that there were at least ten women
who echoed that wish most heartily. It must have been carried in the family without a dissenting
vote.

To this God of the Bible a woman may not go unless her father or husband consents. She can't
even promise to be good without asking permission. This God holds no communication with women
unless their male relations approve. He wants to be on the safe side, I suppose. I'll read
you about that. It is in one of the chapters that are not commonly cited as evidence that God
is no respecter of persons, and that the Bible holds woman as man's equal; nevertheless it
is as worthy of belief as any of the rest of it, and its "Thus saith the Lord" and "as the
Lord commanded Moses" are "frequent and painful and free," as Mr. Bret Harte might say.

Between man and his God they tell us there is no one but a Redeemer; but between woman and
man's God there seems to be all her male relations, which, I should think, would prevent any
very close intimacy. And by the time the divine commands to woman were filtered through the
entire male population, from Moses to the last gentleman who, in the confusion natural to the
occasion, misquotes "with all thy worldly goods I me endow," I should think it not impossible
that some slight errors may have crept in, and the Church should not feel offended if I were
to aid her in their detection.

Here we have two or three passages that are said to be the words of Jesus. I hope that is not
true. But I, believing him to have been a man, can understand how they might have been the
words of even a very good man in that age and with his surroundings; but the words of a perfect
being--never! Of course I know that we have no positive knowledge of any of the words of Jesus,
since no one pretends that they were ever written down until long after his death; but I am
dealing now with the theological creation upon the theologian's own grounds. My own idea of
Jesus places him far above the myth that bears his name.

I hope that Christ did not say that--for his manhood I hope so. I would rather believe that
this is the mistake of some "uninspired" writer than think that one who in much had so gentle
and tender a nature, was unkind and brutal to his mother. No one would attempt, in this age,
to apologize for such a reply to so simple a remark made by a mother to her son. But they say
"he was divine." They also tell us he was a perfect example; but with this evidence before
me, I am glad our men are human. Still I cannot pretend to say that this is not divine--never
having made any divine acquaintances. I can only say, humanity is better.

Then again he is reported to have said a most cruel thing to the broken-hearted mother of a
dying child, and I would rather believe the Bible uninspired and keep my respect for Jesus,
the man. It will be better for this world to believe in Jesus, the brave, earnest man, than
in Jesus, the cruel God.

Do you think that was kind? Do you think it was godlike? What would you think of a physician,
if a woman came to him distressed and said, "Doctor, come to my daughter; she is very ill.
She has lost her reason, and she is all I have!" What would you think of the doctor who would
not reply at all at first, and then, when she fell at his feet and worshiped him, answered
that he did not spend his time doctoring dogs? Would you like him as a family physician? Do
you think that, even if he were to cure the child then, he would have done a noble thing? Is
it evidence of a perfect character to accompany a service with an insult? Do you think a man
who could offer such an indignity to a sorrowing mother has a perfect character, is an ideal
God? I do not. And I hope that Jesus never said it. I prefer to believe that that story is a libel.

It won't do. We have either to give up the "inspiration" theory of the Bible, and acknowledge
that it is the work of men of a crude and brutal age, and like any other book of legend and
myth of any other people; or else to give up the claim that God is any better than the rest
of us. You can take your choice.

Whenever a theologian undertakes to explain matters so as to keep the Bible and the divine
character both intact, I am always reminded of the story of the Irishman who was given a bed
in the second story of a lodging-house the first night he spent in New York. In the night the
fire-engines ran past with their frightful noise. Aroused from a deep sleep and utterly terrified,
Mike's first thought was to get out of the house. He hastily jerked on the most important part
of his costume, unfortunately wrong side before, and jumped out of the window. His friend ran
to the window and exclaimed, "Are ye kilt, Mike?" Picking himself up and looking himself over
by the light of the street lamp, he replied, "No, not kilt, Pat, but I fear I am fatally twishted."

Next we have God's opinion (on Bible authority) as to the use of wives. They were to be forcibly
changed around as a punishment to their husbands and for offences committed by the latter.

     11 Thus saith the Lord, Behold, I will raise up evil against
     thee out of thy own house, and I will take thy wives before
     thy eyes and give them unto thy neighbor.

     --2 Sam. xii.

The latter part of the verse is omitted as being unfit to read. Don't understand that I think
any of it is exactly choice literature; but that cover has been used to silence objection long
enough. If it is fit to teach as the word and will of God for women, it ought to be fit to
read in a theatre--but it is not.

What do you think of a religion that upholds such morals and such justice as that just quoted?
What do you think of women supporting the Bible in the face of that as the will of God? Of
all human beings a woman should spurn the Bible first. She, above all others, should try to
destroy its influence; and I mean to do what little I can in that direction. The morals of
the nineteenth century have outgrown the Bible. Jehovah stands condemned before the bar of
every noble soul. What Moses and David and Samuel taught as the word and will of God, we, who
are fortunate enough to live in the same age with Charles Darwin, know to be the expression
of a low social condition untempered by the light of science. Their "thus saith the Lord,"
read in the light of to-day, is "thus saith ignorance and fear"--no more, no less.

If you will read the 12th chapter of Leviticus, which is unfit to read here, you will see that
the Bible esteems it twice as great a crime to be the mother of a girl as to be the mother
of a boy; so highly esteemed was woman by the priesthood; so great a favorite was she of Jehovah.*

     * See Appendix K.

And do you know there is a law in the Bible* which "the Lord spake unto Moses" that says if
a man is jealous of his wife, "whether he have cause or not," he is to take her to a priest,
and take a little barley meal (if you ever want to try it, remember it must be barley meal;
I don't suppose the priest could tell whether she was guilty or not if you were to take corn
meal or hominy grits) and put it in the wife's hands. And the priest is to take some "holy"
water and scrape up the dirt off the floor of the Tabernacle, and put the dirt in the water
and make the wife drink it. Now just imagine an infinite God getting up a scheme like that!
Then the priest curses her and says if she is guilty she shall rot.... "and she shall say Amen."
That is her defence! Then the priest takes the stuff she has in her hands--this barley-meal
"jealousy offering"--and "waves it before the Lord." (I suppose you all know what that part
is done for. If you don't, ask some theological student with a number six hat-band; he'll tell
you.) And then he burns a pinch of it (that is probably for luck), and at this point it is
time to make the woman drink some more of the filthy water (which he does with great alacrity),
and "if she be guilty the water will turn bitter within her,"... "and she shall be accursed
among her people." (You doubtless perceive that her defence has been most elaborate throughout.)
Do you think that water would be bitter to the priest?

     *See Numbers v. 11-31.

But if she does not complain that the water is bitter, and if her "Amen" is perfectly satisfactory
all round, and she be pronounced innocent, what then? Is the husband in any way reproved for
his brutality? Did the Lord "reveal" to Moses that he should drink the rest of that holy water
and dirt? No! That wasn't in Moses' line. Neither he nor the husband drink the rest of that
water--priest doesn't either; they don't even take a pinch of the barley. But after she is
subjected to this, and the show is over, "if she be innocent, then shall she go free!" Oh,
ye gods! what magnificent generosity! I should have thought they would have hanged her then
for being innocent.

"And then shall the man be guiltless of iniquity, and the woman shall bear her iniquity."

If she is innocent she shall bear her iniquity. You all see how that is done I suppose. If
you don't, ask your little number six theological student, and he will tell you all about it,
and he will also prove to you, without being asked, that he and God are capable of regulating
the entire universe without the aid of General Butler.

But I am told that I ought to respect and love the Bible; that all women ought to take an active
part in teaching it to the heathen, to show them how good Jehovah is to his daughters. But
if he is, he has been unusually unfortunate in his choice of executors.

Nor is it only in the Old Testament that such morals and such justice are taught. The clergy
put that part off by saying--"Oh, that was a different dispensation, and God, the Unchangeable,
has changed his mind." That is the sole excuse they give for all the "holy" men, who used to
talk personally with God, practicing polygamy and all the other immoralities. They maintain
that it was God's best man who upheld polygamy then, and that it is the Devil's best man who
does it now. Odd idea, isn't it? Simply a question of time and place; and as Col. Ingersoll
says, you have got to look on a map to see whether you are damned or not. But it does seem
to me that a God that did not always know better than that, is not a safe chief magistrate.
He might take to those views again, They say history is likely to repeat itself. Anyhow, I
would rather be on the safe side and just fix the laws so that he couldn't. It would be just
as well.

But now we have come to "St." Paul and his ideas on the woman question. He worked the whole
problem by simple proportion and found that man stands in the same relation to woman as God
stands to man. That is, man is to woman as God is to man--and only a slight remainder. I'm
not going to misrepresent this gifted saint. I shall let him speak for himself. He does it
pretty well for a saint, and much more plainly than they usually do. Pretty slim hold on heaven
for most women, isn't it? And then suppose she hasn't any husband? Her case is fatal.

     34  Therefore as the church is subject unto Christ, so let
     the wives be to their own husbands in everything.

     --Ephesians v.

Paul was a modest person in his requirements.

According to the reasoning of verse 13 man should be subject to all the lower animals, because
they were first formed, and then Adam. Verse 14 tells us that Adam sinned knowingly; Eve was
deceived, so she deserves punishment. Now I like that. If you commit a crime understandingly
it is all right. If you are deceived into doing it you ought to be damned. The law says, "The
criminality of an act resides in the intent;" but more than likely St. Paul was not up in Blackstone
and did not use Coke.

I should think that would be a winning card. If the conversation of a wife, coupled with a
good deal of fear, would not convert a man, he is a hopeless case.

But here is Paul again, in all his mathematical glory, and mortally afraid that women won't
do themselves honor.

     6  For if the woman be not covered, let her also be shorn:
     but if it be a shame for a woman to be shorn or shaven, let
     her be covered.

And that settles it, I suppose. But what on earth was man created for? I should not think it
could have been just for fun.

That is a principle that should entitle St. Paul to the profound admiration of women. And yet,
when I come to think of it, I don't know which one gets the worst of that either. Whenever
you want to know anything, ask your husband, at home! No wonder most husbands don't have time
to stay at home much. No wonder they have to see a man so often. Engineering was present to state is

Ignorance and Fear made the Garden of Eden, they created Jehovah, gave Samson his wonderful
strength, and Solomon his wisdom; they divided the Red Sea, and raised Lazarus from the dead.
It is not strange, therefore, that they have compelled women to cling to the Church, and slaves
to cling to slavery. There were many black men in the South who voluntarily went back and offered
to remain in bondage. And that is one of the strongest arguments against the institution of
slavery--that it can so far degrade its victims that they lose even the ambition to be free!*

     * "It was quite an ordinary fact in Greece and Rome for
     slaves to submit to death by torture rather than betray
     their masters. Yet we know how cruelly many Romans treated
     their slaves. But in truth these intense individual feelings
     nowhere rise to such a luxuriant height as under the most
     atrocious institutions. It is part of the irony of life,
     that the strongest feelings of devoted gratitude of which
     human nature seems susceptible, are called forth in human
     beings toward those who, having the power entirely to crush
     their earthly existence, voluntarily refrain from using that
     power. How great a place in most men this sentiment fills,
     even in religious devotion, it would be cruel to inquire. We
     daily see how much their gratitude to Heaven appears to be
     stimulated by the contemplation of fellow-creatures to whom
     God has not been so merciful as he has to themselves."
     --Mill.

The time is not far distant when a bondage of the intellect to the Church will receive no more
respectful consideration than a bondage of the body to a master. This nineteenth century cannot
much longer be bound by the ignorance and intolerance of an age when might was the highest
law and force the only appeal. We need to recognize that the broadest possible liberty is the
greatest possible good; and that the liberty to think is the highest good of all. So don't
let people make you afraid to think, or to laugh at nonsense wherever you see it.

Solomon saying it cannot make a silly thing wise, nor Moses doing it a cruel thing kind. David
cannot make brutality gentle, nor Paul injustice just; and that the Bible sustains a wrong
can never make it right.

Don't you know that if the leading men of the Old Testament were living to-day, they would
be known as liars, thieves, and murderers--some indeed as monsters to whom even these terms
would be base flattery. Despoilers of those who had not injured them; infamous liars in the
name of God; murderers of men; butchers of children; debauchers of women; if they were living
in the nineteenth century they would be unanimously elected to the gallows--that is if they
escaped Judge Lynch long enough. And yet they are held up to us, who have outgrown their morals,
as authorities on the subject of God's will to man, as Prophets, Saints, Mediators!

Do you want your children taught to believe in the purity and honor of such men? Do you want
your children taught to worship a God who sanctioned, commanded, and gloried (and usually participated)
in their worst crimes? Do you want them to believe that at any time, in any age, a God was
the director in the most heinous crimes, in the vilest plots, in the most cruel, vulgar, cowardly
acts of vice that were ever recorded? Railroading, too, that if the piston towards which has the

 I am debarred from touching the parts of it that are the greatest insult
to purity and the most infamous travesties of justice. I can only say to you, read it, and
if you are lovers of purity you will find that it teaches respect for a God who taught the
most degrading impurity and defended those who forced it upon others. If you believe in the
sacredness of human life, he gave the largest license to murder. It does not matter that Moses
said he told him to tell somebody else "Thou shalt not kill;"* for the same gentleman remarked
upon several other occasions that God told him not only to kill, but to steal, to lie, to commit
arson, to break pretty much all the other commandments--and to be a professional tramp besides.
(I am told that he followed this latter occupation for forty years, which I should think would
give him the belt.) So you see we have the same gentleman's word for all of it; and at times,

AS MUCH INSPIRED AS ANY OF IT.

Did it ever occur to you that those absurd tales have as much claim to be called the "word
of God" as any of the rest of it? How can people say they believe such nonsense? And how can
they think it is evidence of goodness to believe it? They say it takes a horribly wicked man
to doubt one of those yarns; and to come right out and say honestly, "I don't believe it,"
will elect you, on the first ballot, to a permanent seat in the lower house. Mr. Talmage says
four out of five Christians "try to explain away" these tales by giving them another meaning,
and he urges them not to do it. He says, stick to the original story in all its literal bearings.
The advice is certainly honest, but it would take a brave man to follow it. And four out of
five of even professed Christians is a pretty heavy balance on the side of intellectual integrity;
and even Mr. Tal-mage's mammoth credulity fails to tip the scale.

They simply can't believe these biblical stones, so they try to explain the marvellous part

 A sensitive man had committed a trifling offence, and he drove a great
spike into the head of the god. A thick-skinned criminal inserted a small tack where it would
do the least harm--in the hoof. An honest, or an egotistic penitent drove his nail in where
it stands out prominently; while the secretive devotee placed his among a mass of others of
long standing and inconspicuous location.

One day I stood with a friend looking at this god. My friend, who was a devout believer in
the vicarious theory of justification and punishment as explained away by the ethical divines
of Boston, was unable to see anything but the most horrible brutality and willingness to inflict
pain on the part of these African devotees, and was equally unable to recognize the same principle
when applied to orthodoxy. She said, "Is it not horrible, the ignorance and superstition of
these poor people? What a vast field of labor our missionaries have."

To her the idea of justification by faith in a suffering god meant only superstition and brutality
when plainly illustrated in somebody else's religion; but the same idea, the same morality,
the same justice, she thought beautiful when applied to Christianity.

I said, "There is the whole vicarious theory in wood and iron. That is exactly the same as
the Christian idea; and the same human characteristics are plainly traceable in the size and
location of these nails.

"A Presbyterian or a Methodist drives his nail in the most conspicuous spot, where the flesh
is tender and the suffering plainly visible. Yet he is like one lift from the dead; and how admirable
his resurrection! All the manner from the down each element'wade the tool is perilous, and a scorch
has go a stream. You Humbie there through retentive grass-- still now up to the knees; and half-bury
sharp life, you prevent "ejaculate how the angling!"

Whitewashed firm-- but so wide-- look down on you from among tree, that shelter them toward side;
while behind is an hutment of stacks, and on the side a argumentation of duty, sometimes that
they are snug in every wind that blows. The Auld'Brigg is being gone, which is a pity; for though
the turn was pastoral thatched, time had so color engineering that in a scattering we have
mistaken it for the rainbow.

While we were talking my friend's pastor joined us, and she told him what I had said, and asked
him what was the difference between the Christian and the heathen idea of a suffering god.
He said he could explain it in five minutes some morning when he had time. He said that the
one was the true and living faith, and the other was blind superstition. He also said that
he could easily make us see which was which. Then he gracefully withdrew with the air of one
who says: "In six days God made the heavens and the earth, and on the seventh day he and I
rested." He has not called since to explain. While he stayed, however, his manner was deeply,
solemnly, awfully impressive; and of course I resigned on the spot.

The theory of vicarious atonement is the child of cowardice and fear. It arranges for a man
to be a criminal and to escape the consequences of his crime. It destroys personal responsibility,
the most essential element of moral character. It is contrary to every moral principle.

The Church never has been and never will be able to explain why a god should be forced to resort
to such injustice to rectify a mistake of his own. To earnest questions and honest thoughts
it has always replied with threats. It has always silenced inquiry and persecuted thought.
Past authority is its god, present investigation its devil. With it brains are below par, and
ignorance is at a premium. It has never learned that the most valuable capital in this world
is the brain of a scholar.

FEAR.

Every earnest thought, like every earnest thinker, adds something to the wealth of the world.
Blind belief in the thought of another produces only hopeless mediocrity. Individual effort,
not mere acceptance, marks the growth of the mind. The most fatal blow to progress is slavery
of the intellect. The most sacred right of humanity is the right to think, and next to the
right to think is the right to express that thought without fear.

Fear is the nearest approach to the ball and chain that this age will permit, and it should
be the glorious aim of the thinkers of to-day that so refined and cruel a form of tyranny shall
not be left for those who come after us. We owe physical freedom to the intellectual giants
of the past; let us leave mental freedom to the intellectual children of the future.

Fear scatters the blossoms of genius to the winds, and superstition buries truth beneath the
incrustation of inherited mediocrity. Fear puts the fetters of religious stagnation on every
child of the brain. It covers the form of purity and truth with the contagion of contumely
and distrust. It warps and dwarfs every character that it touches. It is the father, mother,
and nurse of hypocrisy. It is the one great disgrace of our day, the one incalculable curse
of our time; and its nurse and hot-bed is the Church.

Because I, a woman, have dared to speak publicly against the dictatorship of the Church, the
Church, with its usual force and honor, answers argument with personal abuse. One reply it
gives. It is this. If a woman did not find comfort and happiness in the Church, she would not
cling to it. If it were not good for her, she in her purity and truth would not uphold it in
the face of the undeniable fact that the present generation of thinking men have left it utterly.

You will find, however, that in every land, under every form of faith, in each phase of credulity,
it is the woman who clings closest and longest to the religion she has been taught; yet no
Christian will maintain that this fact establishes the truth of any other belief.*

     * "Exactly the same thing may be said of the women in the
     harem of an Oriental They do not complain.... They think
     our women insufferably unfeminine."
     --Mill.

They will not argue from this that women know more of and have a clearer insight into the divine
will! If she knows more about it, if she understands it all better than men, why does she not
occupy the pulpit? Why does she not hold the official positions in the Churches? Why has she
not received even recognition in our system of religion? Who ever heard of a minister being
surprised that God did not reveal any of the forms of belief through a woman? If she knows
and does the will of God so much better than man, why did he not reveal himself to her and
place his earthly kingdom in her hands?

That argument won't do! As long as creed and Church held absolute power there was no question
but that woman was a curse, that she was an inferior being, an after-thought. No Church but
the Roman Catholic has the decency to recognize even the so-called mother of God! The Church
has never offered women equality or justice. Its test of excellence is force. The closer a
Church or creed clings to its spirit, the more surely does it assume to dictate to and control
woman and to degrade her. The more liberal the creed the nearer does it come to offering individual
justice and liberty.

The testimony of our own missionaries, as well as that of many others, assures us that it is
not the Turk but his wives who hold fastest to their faith. The women of the harem, whom we
pity because of the injustice of their religious training, are the last to relinquish their
god, the most bitter opponents of the infidel or sceptic in their Church, the most devout and
constant believers of the faith, and the most content with its requirements. They are the ones
who cling to the form even when the substance has departed--and it is so with us!

Among the "heathen" it is the women who are most shocked and offended by the attacks made upon
their superstitions by the missionaries whom we pay to go to them and blaspheme their gods
and destroy their idols.

 When, however, the signal tolls from the steeple
on the seventh day, the light is turned off for that day, and for that topic alone; and then
there is brought out once more the old tallow candle of ignorance that hides in shadow the
cobwebs of undeveloped thought!

Use your noblest powers of thought freely in the bank; strain and develop your ability to improve
and control in the engine-room; train and exert your judgment in literature and art; push and
brighten and sharpen your reason in science or political economy.

In the practical affairs of life faith will not help you. It is childish and insecure. It will
not honor your cheque; it will not prevent the broken engine from hurling its human companion
into eternity. It will not prove the rotundity of the earth, nor establish a sound financial
basis for a nation. In all such matters it leads to nothing but ignorance and disaster. In
theology it is the one element of light.

As a test and an aid in this world, it is puerile and trifling; but the depths of the Great
Beyond it fathoms to a nicety. It gives no grasp upon the truths of Time; but it is the all-sufficient
hold on Eternity. It leads to the discovery of no important principle here; but it holds the
keys to the secret chambers of divinity! It is an attribute of childish development now. It
is to indicate infinite mental superiority hereafter!

It is a strange philosophy which asserts that a faculty which is a hindrance to superiority
in this world is the one thing needful for the soul of man!

Give me the brain that dares to think! Give me the mind that grasps with herculean power the
rocks that crush the treasures of intellectual growth, and tears them from their foundation!
Give me the mind that dares to step from the fallen stones, that leaps from rock to rock past
the dark rift torn in the superstitions of ages past, and that, standing on the farthest crag,
waits and watches for the breaking light! He can trust his future whose present scorns stagnation!

DID HE TALK?

In olden times--in the times of the Bible--men believed that animals sometimes used human language,
and that beasts were wiser than their masters. I'm not now going to question that belief, but
still I don't think that nowadays one-half of us would take the word of a horse on any important
subject. You must remember, however, that it took an ass to know an angel at first sight in
Balaam's time. Balaam never suspected that there was an angel in his path until that ass told
him! In those days, on a little matter like that, the word of any beast seemed to be taken
as good evidence.

But let a mule jam his rider's foot against a wall, nowadays, and then lie down under him,
and there is not one man in ten who would associate that fact in his mind with the presence
of an angel. I suppose, however, there wasn't as much known about mules then as there is now;
and most asses were of a more pious turn of mind.

I don't suppose there is one intelligent man in this city who believes that story, and yet
he is not a good Christian if he questions it.

Show me a locality where actual belief--where old time orthodoxy--is looked upon as a requisite
of good citizenship and standing in society, and you will show me a place where intellectual
development and rapid progress have died or gone to sleep!

The most ignorant and backward parts of this great country, the localities where Congress is
asking for better and more secular schools to be established as a means of safety to the state,
are situated in the very States where orthodoxy holds absolute sway. In those states a man
is looked upon as a very dangerous character if he questions the accuracy of that story about
those three hot-house plants, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. Yes, the people of that pious
region would be afraid of a man who was wicked enough to laugh at that yarn; and yet do you
believe there is a man in this city who could make you believe it? And you don't look dangerous
either; and I don't think that I do.

It seems that when they used to run ashore for big scare-stories, they just poked up the fire
and went into the blastfurnace business--here and hereafter. But--seeing that a furnace--a
real one--heated seven times hotter than it takes to melt iron, did not injure those three
tropical innocents--did not even singe their eye-brows--it does look a little as if we should
stand a pretty fair show with the spiritual fuel they now promise us hereafter. Still I must
say I don't believe I should like the climate.

Speaking of Bible arguments, I must tell you of a new one I heard recently. A gentleman acquaintance
of mine asked a colored woman, who had applied to him for money to help build a colored people's
church, whether she thought God was black or white. She replied that the Bible implied that
he was black--that it said, "And His wool shall be whiter than snow;" and that white men don't
have wool!

WHAT YOU MAY THINK.

Show me a grade of society that buckles its little belt of belief and faith around its members,
and you will show me a collection of hopeless mediocres. The thinkers move out or die out.
They object to being fossilized. They decline to go down to history as physical members of
the nineteenth century, and mental members of the third.

I would rather have the right to put on my monument, "She was abreast of her time," than have
all the sounding texts and all the feathered tribes chiseled upon it. I would prefer that it
be said of me, "She was a good woman because she had a pure heart," than to have this record:
"She was a Christian. She was afraid of hell. She cast her burdens on the Lord, and went to
heaven."

You have been told, "Blessed are they who die in the Lord." Rather let us say, "Blessed are
they who live clean lives."

But the Church does not allow you to regulate your lives by what you believe to be right. It
always did and it always will hate a thinker. It proposes to do the mental labor for great
minds by means of brains large enough to hold nothing but Faith. It says, "I cannot, and you
shall not outgrow the past. The measure of my capacity shall be the limit of your attainment."

The laws of a nation presume to regulate only what you may do. The Church is kind enough to
say what you may think. It proposes to control the mental condition of every man and woman
for time and eternity, and its first command is that we shall not grow.

It seems to me rather a queer admission to make, but the Church says that a child or a fool
knows quite enough for its purpose--and it does not seem to be my place to question that fact.
Now that may be all very well for the child and the fool, but it is rather binding on the rest
of us.

Once in a while a minister outgrows the doctrines that were big enough for him in his youth;
but that minister, though his life be as pure and his character as sweet as a flower, would
be safer to be cast into the sea than that this instrument of torture, this court of injustice,
should discover that he had laid aside the outfit of his undeveloped years. His mind may have
grown to be a giant in strength, but it must be compressed into the nut-shell of superstition--dwarfed
to the capacity of intellectual pigmies.

Christ was a thinker, a man of progress, an infidel, a man who outgrew the Church of his time;
and the Church of his time crucified him. Those who oppose the spirit of religious stagnation
to-day meet the same spirit in the Church that Christ met, and receive the same treatment so
far as the law will permit.

 In his time Christ was a great reformer and a brave man.
His philosophy was then an onward spring, and he detested the shams of the Church.

But with the knowledge we have to-day we should call that man a lunatic who tried to bind medical
science by the teachings of that age, and maintained that when a man was sick he had a devil,
and that if he got worse he had a whole flock of them. Yet Christ thought that. We should call
the man utterly insane who insisted that Joshua gave us the last light that is ever to be thrown
on astronomy. We should simply look with pity on one who should try to convince us that the
legal profession ought to be bound by the laws of Moses; and we know that any nation that attempted
to act under his guidance would be soon convinced by the unerring voice of foreign cannon that
somebody had made a mistake.

Science has grown. Philosophy has developed. International law has sprung up. In religion alone
we are asked to accept the standard of morality and honor of ages that are dead--to take as
the last word of wisdom the reformer's code of eighteen hundred years ago. We may grow in all
else; in this we must stand still. We may use a text-book on Nature, Medicine, Law, or Mechanics,
until by its aid we pass beyond its knowledge to a higher; but in morals and religion the book
that was a light to the ages of ignorance and superstition, and the production of its brain,
must still be the sole illuminator of a world made wise and critical and thoughtful by science
and deep experience. The fisherman's lantern, although useful in its day, cannot guide us while
we stand in the glare of electricity. Why stand persistently with our faces westward, and gaze
at the declining light, crying out impotently and hopelessly as we see it grow dim and vanish?

Our wise men have kept steadily onward, guided by the light of the breaking dawn; and with
their faces to the East their star has never set. The fishermen's light has sunk below the
horizon, leaving behind it the glow of honest labor and earnest effort to keep their memory
bright. The scientist's star has risen, and with no claim that it is even yet the highest light--the
final promise, it throws its rays of knowledge, its beams of hope, far into the future, and
bids us follow, leaving the cold embers of the dead past for the warmth and light of the living
future.

The hope of the past is the despair of the future. Stagnation is death. In movement and thought
alone is progress. The wealth of the world is the brain of the scholar.

The past is dead; peace to its ashes. The future is ours to form on new models; models deformed
by past superstitions, or models though faulty, instinct with true freedom. You are the jury,
what is the verdict?

HISTORICAL FACTS AND THEOLOGICAL FICTIONS.

CHURCH FICTIONS.

IT is one of the glittering fictions of the Church that to her civilization is due,* and that
it is to her benign influence and direction alone that woman has been advanced to her present
position in the social scale; that without the Bible and the Church the status of woman in
Christian countries would be lower and her lot harder.

     * See Appendix T,

1st. To prove this claim she directs attention to the status of woman in several non-Christian
countries, and compares the degradation and hardship she there endures to the position of woman
to-day in America, England, and France.

2d. The Church claims the credit of originating and sustaining the various steps of progress
by which woman has been elevated. She claims to have originated and to sustain the idea that
woman is man's equal, and to recognize her as such in the Church.

3d. She points with pride to the superior education and intelligence of the women of Christian
countries, and contrasts this intellectual altitude with that of women elsewhere. She says
that women owe their superior opportunities of education and advancement to their religion.

4th. But above all the clergy attempt to silence those who ask questions, by calling attention
to the superior legal status of woman in Christian countries, and asserting that the Church
secured this, and that it made marriage honorable and home a possibility.

5th. The clergy claim that the Bible is woman's best friend and staunchest defender, and that
it is the originator of morality.

HISTORICAL FACTS.

     "The moment there is fixation, petrification and death
     ensue." "Profound sincerity is the only basis of
     character."
     --Emerson.

CIVILIZATION.

We are told that our superior civilization and high moral tone are due to Christianity. I think
that this is not true. The whole, or at least much the larger and foundation part of the question
of civilization--where it shall grow and where only live, where it shall drag and where scarcely
exist--seems to me to be decided primarily by environment, the basis of which is climate and soil.

Where the climate and soil are most favorable to the highest development; where the environment
is neither too hard nor too indulgent; where man is neither enervated by heat and the absence
of necessity to labor, nor stunted by cold and hardship and the ever-present necessity to search
or labor for food and warmth; there will be the highest types and forms of civilization.*

     * See Appendix A*

If the Buddhist religion had chanced to be the one that in the process of events took root
in the climate and soil where the Hebrew Bible and the Christian belief hold sway; and if,
on the other hand, the Hebrew and Christian religions had been the ones developed in India
or China, the civilization of the various countries would still, in the main, be what they
are to-day.

If our superior civilization were the result of our religion, then the most civilized countries
would be the most intensely Christian countries. We all know that this is not the case. Compare
the intense Christianity of Spain or Russia, and their backward civilization, with the easy-going
religious or irreligious condition of France or America, and their recognition of Liberty and
Humanity, equalled nowhere else on earth.

I admit unreservedly that a religion; by its inelasticity, may do much to retard progress,
or by its greater elasticity may permit a more rapid development than a more nearly petrified
or incoherent system would allow; but what I hold is this, that the primary and controlling
causes of the various stages of civilization are climate and soil.

There are, of course, many other things which modify the social development or civilization
in any country, as its religion, its laws, and what we may call "accidents of international
or civil contest," such as the religious or other wars--our own war in which the blacks were
freed, arbitration, and immigration. All of these, and many others, are modifying influences;
but no one of them can claim the primary place.

Soil, climate, and location determine the occupation of a nation, as whether it shall be militant,
commercial, or agricultural. In turn occupation determines what the character of a people and
their laws shall be, whether they shall be warlike or peaceful, inventive or receptive, stationary
or roving; and these, in turn, are the matters which determine the civil scale to which a people
shall rise.

True, the religion of a people will make itself felt strongly; but whenever a nation has found
it expedient or desirable to accomplish a feat which was in opposition to its religion, it
has invariably modified the religion to fit the case, or waived it in favor of that particular
movement.*

     * "The popular religion in this, as in other cases, was
     made to bend to the new vice."--Lecky's History of European
     Morals, vol. il, page 311.

In keeping with this fact it is found that in those countries where the greatest changes and
modifications of government and occupation have occurred, there have the religions undergone
the greatest modification to fit the new order of things. If it were the religion that determined
the matter, civilization and morals would be immovable, and legislation would revolve around,
the guidance of the Church.

According to the very theory of Divine revelation a religion would be most perfect at its beginning.
It would be without flaw when born. It would be incapable of improvement or growth. In a word
it would be immovable. It would possess the fixation of which Emerson speaks. It would not
have to readjust itself to the changed and improved conditions of man, and its word would be
always a higher light on every movement of progress. It would be to the Church and not to the
State that the great principles of progress, of liberty, and of justice would look for the
highest guidance and the last light. How far this is from the real state of things in any country
or in any religion all readers of history know.*

     * See Appendix B.

It is the State or Science which has proposed and made the steps of progress, and the Church
has (often after the most bitter fight and denunciation) readjusted her creed to the new code,
and then claimed that she had that light and knew that principle before, although neither she
nor any one else had ever suspected it.

This has been the case with almost every important discovery that Science has ever made. The
Church has retarded the acceptance of the new light, and has set her seal of "divine disapproval
and damnation" on the brow of the thinkers who strove to bless mankind. Section RECOMPENSES who will read him should do of Honor do i receive

 In the countries named above, and in other countries
where the Church still has a strong grip upon the throat of the State, woman's position is
degraded indeed; while in the three so-called Christian countries where the Church has least
power, where law is not wholly or in so large part canonical, woman's position is more free,
more independent, and less degraded, when compared with the position of the men of those countries.

That tells the whole story. If it were to the Church or to her religion that she owed her advancement,
it would be in the most strictly Christian countries that her elevation and advantages would
be greatest. Under the canon law her status would be higher than under the common law. On the
contrary, however, it is under the least religious, freest, and most purely secular forms of
government that she has attained most full recognition and secured the greatest advancement.

Compare the position of woman in Christian Spain with her position in Infidel France. Compare
her condition in Russia, with the flag of the Church and the seal of the Cross for her protection,
with that of her sister under the stars and stripes of America, with a constitution written
by the infidels Jefferson and Paine.

Compare them and decide whether it is to the Church and the Cross, with their wars and persecutions,
or to Liberty and Scepticism that women owe their loyal love and their earnest support. Compare
them and determine then whether it is to Christianity or to Science that she should fly for
protection, and where it is that she will be most certain of justice. Compare them and answer
whether it is to the Fathers of the Church or to the Founders of Republics that women should
be most grateful. Compare them, and be thankful, oh women of America, that the Church never
had her hand on the throat of the Constitution of the United States, and that she is losing
her grip on the Supreme Bench! I am go therefore merely at difficulty; but not powerfully it arrive
into knowledge that the ghost of Socrates, the perfect that simply come
to noddle, should by this idea of hitherto necessary recommendation;
for i cannot gestate to the self were any motion of a nature: i maine

fuss. If virtuousness cannot'radiance bright, but nothing of that
ambivalence of resistance potestas, i will we was so state that she
cannot subsist without such aid of vice, and that it is from that
she deduce her honor standing?

them, by their instrument, have yield the manifest verification?

As have several others, who i do sing to have excel-- personalty so the dull regulation of domain.
What subordinate, too, that it would always come to that perfect and ungenerous delectation,
which do record that it nurture trophy had tenderly in their thigh, and there do engineering stand

WOMEN AS PERSONS.

Blackstone enumerates three "absolute rights of persons." First, "The right of personal security,
in the legal enjoyment of life, limb, body, health, and reputation." Second, "The right of
personal liberty--free power of locomotion without legal restraint." Third, "The right of private
property--the free use and disposal of his own lawful acquisitions."

None of these three primary and essential rights of persons were conceded to women, and Church
law did not rank her as a person deprived of these rights, but held that she was not a person
at all, but only a function; therefore she possessed no rights of person in this world and
no hope of safety in the next.

As to the first of these "absolute rights of persons," any one of her male relations, or her
husband after she passed from one to the other, had absolute power over her, even to the extent
of bodily injury,* bargain and sale of her person, and death. Nor did even this limit the number
of her masters. By both Church and Common Law the Lords temporal (barons and other peers) and
the Lords spiritual (Archbishops, Bishops, and Abbots) possessed and exercised the right to
dispose of her purity, either for a money consideration or as a bribe or present as they saw fit.**

     * "Although England was christianized in the fourth century,
     it was not until the tenth that a daughter had a right to
     reject a husband selected for her by her father; and it was
     not until the same century that a Christian wife of a
     Christian husband acquired the right of eating at the table
     with him. For many hundred years the law bound out to
     servile labor all unmarried women between the ages of eleven
     and forty."--M. J. Gage.

     "Wives in England were bought from the fifth to the
     eleventh century" [The dates are significant; let the Church
     respond.]--Herbert Spencer.

     "In England, as late as the seventeenth century, husbands of
     decent station were not ashamed to beat their wives.
     Gentlemen arranged parties of pleasure for the purpose of
     seeing wretched women whipped at Bridewell. It was not until
     1817 that the public whipping of women was abolished in
     England."--Spencer.

     ** See Appendix E.

Thus was the forced degradation of woman made a source of revenue to the Church, and a means
of crushing her self-respect and destroying her sense of personal responsibility as to her
own acts in the matter of chastity, the legitimate outcome of which is to be found in the vast
army of women who are named only to be reviled. In them the Church can look on her own work.
The fruit is the natural outcome of the training woman received that taught and compelled her
always to submit to the dictates of some man, no matter what her own judgment, modesty, or
desires might be. She was not supposed to have an opinion or to know right from wrong; and
from Paul's injunction, "If you want to know anything ask your husband at home," down to the
decisions of the last General Conference of the Methodist Church, the teaching that woman must
subordinate her own sense of right and her own judgment to the dictates of someone else--any
one else of the opposite sex--from first to last has been as ingenious a method as could have
been devised to fill the world with libertines and their victims.* It is time for the followers
of St. Paul to nice the results of their own work.

     * See Appendix F, 2.

Under the provisions of the law which held that all "persons" could recover damages for injury--have
legal redress for a wrong inflicted upon them--woman again was held as not a 'person.

If she were assaulted and beaten, or if she were subjected to the greatest indignity that it
is possible to inflict upon her, she had no redress. She could not complain. The law gave her
no protection whatever. Her father or husband could, if he saw fit, bring suit to recover damages
for the loss of her services as a servant and wholly upon the ground that it was an injury
to him and to his feelings. She was no more recognized as a "person" in the matter, nor was
she more highly considered than if she were an inmate of a zoological garden to which some
mischievous visitor had fed too many bonbons. The owner was damaged because the brute might
die or be injured in the sight of the patrons, but aside from that view of the case no harm
was done and no account taken of so trivial a matter.

No matter what the injury she sustained, whether it crippled her physically or blighted her
mentally and made life to her the worst curse that could be inflicted, she had no appeal. The
wounded feelings of one of her male relations received due consideration, and he could recover
the money-value he might set upon the injury to his lacerated mind. This is still the letter
and the practice of the law in many places, even in America.

If she had no male relations, the injury did not count, and no "person" being injured everything
was lovely, and prayers went right on to the God who, being no respecter of persons (provided
they were free, white, adult males), enjoyed the incense from altars whereon burning "witches"
writhed in agony and helpless young girls plead for mercy under the loathed and loathsome touch
of the "St." Augustines* and "St." Pelayos,** whose praises are chanted and whose divine goodness
is recounted by Christendom to-day.

     * "To Augustine, whose early life was spent in company with
     the most degraded of womankind, is Christianity indebted for
     the full development of the doctrine of Original sin."
     --Gage.

     "All or at least the greater part of the fathers of the
     Greek Church before Augustine, denied any real original
     sin."--Emerson. "The doctrine had a gradual growth, and was
     fully developed by Augustine."
     --Waite.

     ** "The abbot elect of St. Augustine, at Canterbury, in
     1171, was found on investigation to have seventeen
     illegitimate children in a single village.   An abbot of St.
     Pelayo in Spain, in 1180, was proved to have kept no less
     than seventy mistresses. Henry III, Bishop of Liege, was
     deposed in 1274 for having sixty-five illegitimate
     children."
     --Leeky, "Hist, of European Morals."

     "This same bishop boasted, at a public banquet, that in
     twenty-two months fourteen children had been born to him. A
     license to the clergy to keep concubines was during several
     centuries levied by princes."--Ibid.

     "It was openly attested that 100,000 women in England alone
     were made dissolute by the clergy."

 But fortunately for women the civilization of freedom has outgrown St. Paul
as it has the dictates of the Church, and one by one the doors of information, and hence the
doors to honest labor, have been opened, and the possibility of living with dignity and honor
has replaced the forced degradation of the days when the power of the Church enabled it to
reduce women to the animal existence it so long forced upon her.

So long as the Church allowed woman but one avenue of support, so long did it force her to
use that single means of livelihood. So long as it made her believe that she could bring to
this world nothing of value but her capacity to minister to the lower animal wants of man,
so long did it force upon her that single alternative--or starvation.

So long as it is able to make multitudes of women believe themselves of value for but one purpose,
just that long will it continue to insure the degradation of many of those women who are helpless,
or weak, or loving, or ignorant of the motives of those in whose power they are. So long as
it teaches woman that she can repay her debt to the world in but one way, so long will it promote
commerce in vice and revenue in shame.

Every man is taught that he can repay his debt to this world in many ways. He has open to him
many avenues of happiness, many paths to honorable employment. If he fails in one there is
still hope. If he misses supreme happiness in marriage he has still left ambition, labor, study,
fame; if the one failure overtakes him, no matter how sad, he still can turn aside and find,
if not joy, at least occupation and rest.

But the Church has always taught woman that there is but one "sphere," one hope, one occupation,
one life for her. If she fails in that, what wonder that with broken hope comes broken virtue
or despair? Every woman who has fallen or lost her way has been previously taught by the Church
that she had and has but one resource; that there is open to her in life but one path; that
whether that path be legally crooked or straight, she was created for but one purpose; that
man is to decide for her what that purpose is; and that she must under no circumstances set
her own judgment up against his.

The legitimate fruits of such an education are too horribly apparent to need explanation. Every
fallen woman is a perpetual monument to the infamy of a religion and a social custom that narrow
her life to the possibilities of but one function, and provide her no escape--a system that
trains her to depend wholly on one physical characteristic of her being, and to neglect all else.

That system teaches her that her mind is to be of but slight use to her; that her hands may
not learn the cunning of a trade nor her brain the bearings of a profession; that mentally
she is nothing; and that physically she is worse than nothing only in so far as she may minister
to one appetite. I hold that the most legitimate outcome of such an education is to be found
in the class that makes merchandise of all that woman is taught that she possesses that is
of worth to herself or to this world. No system could be more perfectly devised to accomplish
this purpose.*

      * See Lea's "Sacerdotal Celibacy."

AS WIVES.

We are told that women owe honorable marriage to Christianity;* that the more beautiful and
tender relations of husband and wife find their root there; that Christianity protects and
elevates the mother as no other law or religion ever has. Let us see.

     * See Appendix I, 1-2.

On this subject I find in Maine's "Ancient Law" these facts:

     "Although women had been objects of barter and sale,
     according to barbaric usages, between their male relatives,
     the later Roman [Pagan] law having assumed, on the theory
     of Natural Law, the equality of the sexes, control of the
     person of women was quite obsolete when Christianity was
     born. Her situation had become one of great personal liberty
     and proprietary independence, even when married, and the
     arbitrary power over her of her male relations, or her
     guardian, was reduced to a nullity, while the form of
     marriage conferred on the husband no superiority."

     Thus as a daughter and as a wife had she grown to be honored
     and recognized as an equal under Pagan rule.

     And again began the sale of women. Christianity held her as
     unclean and in all respects inferior; and "during the era
     which begins modern history the women of dominant races are
     seen everywhere under various forms of archaic guardianship,
     and the husband pays a money price to her male relations
     for her. The prevalent state of religious sentiment may
     explain why it is that modern jurisprudence has absorbed
     among its rudiments much more than usual of those rules
     [archaic] concerning the position of women which belong
     peculiarly to an imperfect civilization."
     --Ibid.

Thus it will be seen that from the first, and extending down to the present, the Church did
all she could to cast woman back into the night of the race from which in a great measure she
had been rescued through the ages when Natural Law and not "revelation" was the guide of man.
The laws which the Church found liberal and just toward women it discarded, and it searched
back in the ages of night for such as it saw fit to re-enact for her. Of this Maine says: "The
husband now draws to himself the power which formerly belonged to his wife's male relatives,
the only difference being that he no longer pays anything for the privilege."

As Christians grew economical wives came cheaper than formerly, and it became a dogma that
wives were not worth much anyhow, and then, too, it enabled persons of limited means to have
more of them. Of a somewhat later date Maine says: "At this point heavy disabilities begin
to be imposed upon wives."

That was to make marriage honorable and attractive, no doubt, and, says Maine: "It was very
long before the subordination entailed on women by marriage was sensibly diminished." And what
diminution it received came from men who fought against Church law.*

     *See Lecky, Maine, Lea, Milman, Christian, Blackstone,
     Morley, and others for ample proof of this fact

It was only the crumbs of liberty, honor, and justice extorted by men who fought the Church
on behalf of wives, that lightened their most oppressive burdens. It was true then, and it
is true to-day, that women owe what justice and freedom and power they possess to the fact
that the best and clearest-headed men are more honorable than our religion, and that they have
invited Moses and St. Paul to take a back seat Moses has complied, and St. Paul is half-way
down the aisle.

Some of the clergy now explain that although Paul may have written certain things inimical
to women, he did not mean them, so it is all right. Such passages as 1 Cor. xi. 3-9; xiv. 34-35;
and Eph. v. 22-24, are now explained to be intended in a purely Pickwickian sense; and a Rev.
Mr. Boyd, of St. Louis, has even gone so far as to produce the doughty apostle before a woman-suffrage
society, as on their side of that argument. This second conversion of St. Paul impresses one
as even more remarkable than his first. It took an "angel of God" to show him the error of
his ways in Ephesus, but one little Baptist preacher did it this time--all by himself. Truly
St. Paul is getting easier to deal with than he used to be.

But to resume, Maine, in tracing the amalgamation of the later Roman (Pagan) law with the archaic
laws of a lower civilization (the result of which was Christian law), shows that the Church,
while it chose the Roman laws, which had arrived at so high a state, for others, retained for
women, and particularly for wives, the least favorable of the Roman, eked out with the archaic
Patria Potestas and the more degrading provisions of the earlier civilizations. Maine reluctantly
says that the jurisconsults of the day contended for better laws for wives, but that the Church
prevailed in most instances, and established the more oppressive ones.

With certain of these laws--the worst ones--I cannot deal here for obvious reasons; but a few
of them I may be permitted to give without offence to the modesty of any one. The husband becomes
her baron or lord--she his servant.

That is to say the husband acquires all the rights, and the wife all the disabilities; and
the Church wishing to be fair has made the latter as many as possible. The working of this
principle has been so often illustrated as to render comment unnecessary. A wife retains no
rights which her husband is bound to respect, no matter how solemn the compact before marriage,
nor what her belief in its strength might have been.

Fortunately for women, happily for wives, men are more decent than their religion; and the
law of custom and public opinion has largely outgrown this enactment of the Church, made when
she had the power to thus degrade women and brutalize men. "But in criminal prosecutions, it
is true, the wife may be indicted and punished separately." *

     * Blackstone.

In the case of punishment the Church was entirely willing to give the devil his due. It had
no ambition to deprive women of any indictments and punishments that were to be had. In this
case, although the husband and wife were one, she was that one. Where privileges or property-rights
were to be considered, he was the "one." Such grand reversible doctrines were always on tap
with the clergy, and their barrel was always full. Truly, wives do owe much to the Church.

Some of the provisions of these laws have, of late years, been modified by the efforts of men
who were pronounced "infidels, destroyers of the Bible, the home, and the dignity of women,"
aided by women whom the orthodox deride as "strong--minded, ill-balanced, coarse, impious,"
etc., etc., ad infinitum, ad nauseam. A strong mind, whether in man or woman, has always been
to the clergy as a red rag to a bull.

"A woman may make a will, with the assent of her husband, by way of appointment of her personal
property. She cannot even with his consent devise lands.... Although our law in general considers
a man and wife as one person, yet there are some instances where she is considered separately
as his inferior," and for that trip only.

As I remarked before when it comes to penalties she is welcome to the whole lot.

"She may not make a deed."

"A man may administer moderate correction to his wife."

"These are the chief legal effects of marriage. Even the disabilities of the wife," Blackstone
naively remarks, "are for the most part intended for her protection; so great a favorite is
the female sex of the laws of England!"

I should think that if this latter point were not quite clear to a woman, "moderate correction"
might convince her that she was quite an unreasonable favorite--beyond her most eager desires.
Where the Pagan law recognized her as the equal of her husband, the Church discarded that law,
and based the Canon Law upon an archaic invention.

"Their creed is of the simplest kind; it is to fear God, to live a life of pure thoughts, pure
words, pure deeds, and to die in the hope of a world to come. It is the creed of those who
have lived nearest to God and served him faithfullest in every age, and wherever they dwell
who accept it and practice it, they bear witness to that which makes them children of God and
brethren of the prophets, among whom Zoroaster was not the least. The Jews were carried away
as captives to Babylon some 600 years before Christ, and during the seventy years of their
exile there, they came into contact with the Persian religion and derived from it ideas about
the immortality of the soul, which their own religion did not contain. They also borrowed from
it their belief in a multitude of angels, and in Satan as the ruler over evil spirits." [So
you see that even our devil is a borrowed one, and it now seems to be about time to return
him with thanks. ] "The ease with which man believes in unearthly powers working for his hurt
prepares a people to admit into its creed the doctrine of evil spirits, and although it is
certain that the Jews had no belief in such spirits before their captivity in Babylon, they
spoke of Satan (which means an adversary) as a messenger sent from God to watch the deeds of
men and accuse them to Him for their wrong-doing. Satan thus becoming by degrees an object
of dread, upon whom all the evil which befell man was charged, the minds of the Jews were ripe
for accepting the Persian doctrine of Ahriman with his legions of devils. Ahriman became the
Jewish Satan, a belief in whom formed part of early Christian doctrine, and is now but slowly
dying out. What fearful ills it has caused, history has many a page to tell. The doctrine that
Satan, once an angel of light, had been cast from heaven for rebellion against God, and had
ever since played havoc among mankind, gave rise to the belief that he and his demons could
possess the souls of men and animals at pleasure. Single been of so ha'p'orth. Homo, he is those when

Appendix D.

Within the reign of the present sovereign Mrs. Gage tells us of a young girl being ordered
by the Petty Sessions Bench back to the "service" of a landlord, from whom she had run away
because such service meant the sacrifice of her honor. She refused to go and was put in jail.

Appendix E.

1. "Women were taught by the Church and State alike, that the Feudal Lord or Seigneur had a
right to them, not only against themselves, but as against any claim of husband or father.
The law known as Marchetta, or Marquette, compelled newly-married women to a most dishonorable
servitude. They were regarded as the rightful prey of the Feudal Lord from one to three days
after their marriage, and from this custom, the oldest son of the serf was held as the son
of the lord, 'as perchance it was he who begat him.' From this nefarious degradation of woman,
the custom of Borough-English arose, in which the youngest son became the heir.... France,
Germany, Prussia, England, Scotland, and all Christian countries where feudalism existed, held
to the enforcement of Marquette. The lord deemed this right as fully his as he did the claim
to half the crops of the land, or to half the wool of the sheep. More than one reign of terror
arose in France from the enforcement of this law, and the uprisings of the peasantry over Europe
during the twelfth century, and the fierce Jacquerie, or Peasant Wars, of the fourteenth century
in France owed their origin, among other causes, to the enforcement of these claims by the
lords upon the newly-married wife. The edicts of Marly transplanted that claim to America when
Canada was under the control of France. To persons not conversant with the history of feudalism,
and of the Church for the first fifteen hundred years of its existence, it will seem impossible
that such foulness could ever have been part of Christian civilization. That the crimes they
have been trained to consider the worst forms of heathendom could have existed in Christian
Europe, upheld by both Church and State for more than a thousand five hundred years, will strike
most people with incredulity. Such, however, is the truth; we can but admit well-attested facts
of history, how severe a blow soever they strike our preconceived beliefs.

"Marquette was claimed by the Lords Spiritual,* as well as by the Lords Temporal. The Church
indeed, was the bulwark of this base feudal claim. With the power of penance and excommunication
in its grasp, this demand could neither have originated nor been sustained unless sanctioned
by the Church.... These customs of feudalism were the customs of Christianity during many centuries.
(One of the Earls of Crawford, known as the 'Earl Brant,' in the sixteenth century, was probably
among the last who openly claimed by right the literal translation of droit de Jambage.) These
infamous outrages upon woman were enforced under Christian law by both Church and State.

     * "In days to come people will be slow to believe that the
     law among Christian nations went beyond anything decreed
     concerning the olden slavery; that it wrote down as an
     actual right the most grievous outrage that could ever wound
     man's heart. The Lords Spiritual (clergy) had this right
     no less than the Lords Temporal. The parson, being a lord,
     expressly claimed the first fruits of the bride, but was
     willing to sell his right to the husband. The Courts of
     Berne openly maintain that this right grew up naturally."--
     Michelet, "La Sorcerie," p.62

"The degradation of the husband at this infringement of the lord spiritual and temporal upon
his marital right, has been pictured by many writers, but history has been quite silent upon
the despair and shame of the wife. No hope appeared for woman anywhere. The Church.... dragged
her to the lowest depths, through the vileness of its priestly customs.... We who talk of the
burning of wives upon the funeral pyres of husbands in India, may well turn our eyes to the
records of Christian countries."--Matilda Joslyn Gage in "Woman, Church, and State."

2. From this point Mrs. Gage calls attention to the various efforts to throw off this degrading
custom. The women held meetings at night, and among other things travestied the celebration
of Mass and other Church customs; but the end and aim of these meetings being a protest and
rebellion against Marquette, the clergy called those who took part in them "witches;"* and
then and there began the persecution which the Church carried on against women under this disguise
(under Catholic and Protestant rule alike), which extended down to the latter part of the last
century, with its list of horrors and indignities extending over all Christian countries and
blossoming in all their vigor in our own eastern States, upheld by Luther, John Wesley, and
Baxter, who unfortunately had not at that time entered into the everlasting rest of the Saints.
And, true to these noble and wise leaders, the Churches which they founded are to-day expressing
the same sentiments (in principle) in regard to the honor and dignity and position of woman.
The arguments of the Rev. Dr. Craven, the prosecutor in the famous Presbyterian trial of 1876,
which are given by Mrs. Gage, together with numerous other similar ones, fully establish the
fact that woman is to the Church what she always was--so far as secular law will permit. And
numerous instances (such as the Buckley exhibition at the last Methodist Conference, in which
he was sustained by the Conference) prove that they have learned nothing since 1876.

     * "There are few superstitions which have been so universal
     as a belief in witchcraft. The severe theology of paganism
     despised the wretched superstition, which has been greedily
     believed by millions of Christians."--Buckle.

3. I wish I might copy here the sermon to women which the Rev. Knox-Little, the well-known
High-Church clergyman of England, preached when in this country in 1880, in which he said,
"There is no crime which a man can commit which justifies his wife in leaving him. It is her
duty to subject herself to him always, and no crime that he can commit can justify her lack
of obedience." Although a little balder in statement than are most utterances of orthodox clergymen
in this age, yet in sentiment and in the reason given for it the echo of "Amen" comes from
every pulpit where a believer in original sin, vicarious atonement, or the inspiration of the
Bible has a representative and a voice. If self-respect or honor is ever to be the lot of woman,
it will not be until her foot is on the neck of orthodoxy, and when the Bible ranks where it
belongs in the field of literature.

Appendix F.

1. "The French government, about the middle of the eighteenth century, seems to have reached
the maturity of its wickedness, allowing if not instigating religious persecutions of so infamous
a nature that they would not be believed if they were not attested by documents of the courts
in which the sentences were passed."--Buckle.

2. Of Louis XV., the eminently Christian king of France, Buckle says: "His harem cost more
than 100,000,000 francs, and was composed of little girls. He was constantly drunk," and "turned
out his own illegitimate children to prostitute themselves."

3. "It will hardly be believed that, when sulphuric ether was first used to lessen the pains
of childbirth, it was objected to as 'a profane attempt to abrogate the primeval curse pronounced
upon woman....' The injury which the theological principle has done to the world is immense.
It has prevented men from studying the laws of nature."--Buckle.

Appendix G.

1. "The narrow range of their sympathies [the clergy's], and the intellectual servitude they
have accepted, render them peculiarly unfitted for the office of educating the young, which
they so persistently claim, and which, to the great misfortune of the world, they were long
permitted to monopolize.... The almost complete omission from female education of those studies
which most discipline and strengthen the intellect, increases the difference, while at the
same time it has been usually made a main object to imbue them with a passionate faith in traditional
opinions, and to preserve them from all contact with opposing views. But contracted knowledge
and imperfect sympathy are not the sole fruits of this education. It has always been the peculiarity
of a certain kind of theological teaching, that it -inverts all the normal principles of judgment
and absolutely destroys intellectual diffidence. On other subjects we find if not a respect
for honest conviction, at least some sense of the amount of knowledge that is requisite to
entitle men to express an opinion on grave controversies. I put to control how will so blessed to outgrow they

4. "Among those causes of human improvement that are of most importance to the general welfare,
must be included the total annihilation of the prejudices which have established between the
sexes an inequality of right, fatal even to the party which it favors. In vain might we seek
for motives to justify the principle, in difference of physical organization, of intellect,
or of moral sensibility. It had at first no other origin but abuse of strength, and all the
attempts which have since been made to support it are idle sophisms."--"Progress of the Human
Mind," Condorcet.

5. Notwithstanding the work of such men as the Encyclopedists of France and other liberal thinkers
for the proper recognition of women, the Church had held her grip so tight that upon the passage
of the bill, as late as 1848, giving to married women the right to own their own property,
the most doleful prophesies went up as to the just retribution that would fall upon women for
their wicked insubordination, and upon the men who had defied divine commands so far as to
pass such a law. A recent writer tells us that Wm. A. Stokes, in talking to a lady whom he
blamed for its passage, said: "We hold you responsible for that law, and I tell you now you
will live to rue the day when you opened such a Pandora's box in your native State, and cast
such an apple of discord into every family of the State."

And the sermons that were preached against it--the prophecies of deacon and preacher--were
so numerous, so denunciatory, and so violent that they form a queer and interesting chapter
in the history of the attitude of the Church toward women, and illustrate, in our own time,
how persistent it has been in its efforts to prevent woman from sharing in the benefits of
the higher civilization of the nineteenth century.

But fortunately for women, Infidels are more numerous than they ever were before, and the power
of the Church is dying of dry rot, or as Col. Ingersoll wittily says, of the combined influence
of softening of the brain and ossification of the heart.

Appendix O.

"St. Gregory the Great describes the virtue of a priest, who through motives of piety had discarded
his wife... Their wives, in immense numbers, were driven forth with hatred and with scorn...
Pope Urban II. gave license to the nobles to reduce to slavery the wives of priests who refused
to abandon them."--Lecky.

Appendix P.

1. "Hallam denies that respect for women is due to Christianity. "--Buckle.

2. "In England, wives are still occasionally led to the market by a halter around the neck
to be sold by the husband to the highest bidder."--Ibid.

"The sale of a wife with a halter around her neck is still a legal transaction in England.

3. "Contempt for woman, the result of clerical teaching, is shown in myriad forms."--Gage.

4. "The legal subordination of one sex to another is wrong in itself, and is now one of the
chief hindrances to human improvement."--John Stuart Mill.

5. "I have no relish for a community of goods resting on the doctrine, that what is mine is
yours, but what is yours is not mine; and I should prefer to decline entering into such a compact
with anyone, though I were myself the person to profit by it."--Ibid.

It will take a long time for that sort of morality to filter into the skull of the Church,
and when it does the skull will burst.

6. "Certain beliefs have been inculcated, certain crimes invented, in order to intimidate the
masses. Hence the Church made free thought the worst of sins, and the spirit of inquiry the
worst of blasphemies.... As late as the time of Bunyan the chief doctrine inculcated from the
pulpit was obedience to the temporal power.... All these influences fell with crushing weight
on woman."--Matilda Joslyn Gage in "Hist. Woman Suffrage."

7. "Taught that education for her was indelicate and irreligious, she has been kept in such
gross ignorance as to fall a prey to superstition, and to glory in her own degradation... Such
was the prejudice against a liberal education for woman, that the first public examination
of a girl in geometry (1829) created as bitter a storm of ridicule as has since assailed women
who have entered the law, the pulpit, or the medical profession."--Ibid.

Appendix Q.

1. "The five writers to whose genius we owe the first attempt at comprehensive views of history
were Bolingbroke, Montesquieu, Voltaire, Hume, and Gibbon. Of these the second was but a cold
believer in Christianity, if, indeed, he believed in it at all; and the other four were avowed
and notorious infidels."--Buckle.

2 "Here, then, we have the starting-point of progress--scepticism.... All, therefore, that
men want is no hindrance from their political and religious rulers.... Until common minds doubt
respecting religion they can never receive any new scientific conclusion at variance with it--as
Joshua and Copernicus."--Ibid.

3. "The immortal work of Gibbon, of which the sagacity is, if possible, equal to the learning,
did find readers, but the illustrious author was so cruelly reviled by men who called themselves
Christians, that it seemed doubtful if, after such an example, subsequent writers would hazard
their comfort and happiness by attempting to write philosophic history. Middleton wrote in
1750.... As long as the theological spirit was alive nothing could be effected."--Ibid.

4. "The questions which presented themselves to the acuter minds of a hundred years ago were
present to the acuter minds who lived hundreds of years before that.... But the Church had
known how to deal with intellectual insurgents, from Abelard in the twelfth century down to
Bruno and Vanini in the seventeenth. They were isolated, and for the most part submissive;
and if they were not, the arm of the Church was very long and her grasp mortal.... They [the
thinkers] could have taught Europe earlier than the Church allowed it to learn, that the sun
does not go round the earth, and that it is the earth which goes round the sun.... After the
middle of the last century the insurrection against the pretensions of the Church and against
the doctrines of Christianity was marked in one of its most important phases by a new, and
most significant, feature.... It was an advance both in knowledge and in moral motive.... The
philosophical movement was represented by "Diderot" [leading the Encyclopaedist circle.]...
Broadly stated the great central moral of it was this: that human nature is good, that the
world is capable of being made a desirable abiding-place, and that the evil of the world is
the fruit of bad education and bad institutions. This cheerful doctrine now strikes on the
ear as a commonplace and a truism. A hundred years ago in France it was a wonderful gospel,
and the beginning of a new dispensation.... Into what fresh and unwelcome sunlight it brought
the articles of the old theology... Every social improvement since has been the outcome of
that new doctrine in one form or another.... The teaching of the Church paints men as fallen
and depraved. The deadly chagrin with which churchmen saw the new fabric rising was very natural....
The new secular knowledge clashed at a thousand points, alike in letter and spirit, with the
old sacred lore.... A hundred years ago this perception was vague and indefinite, but there
was an unmistakable apprehension that the Catholic ideal of womanhood was no more adequate
to the facts of life, than Catholic views about science, or popery, or labor, or political
order and authority."--Morley.

And it took the rising infidels to discover the fact. See Morley, "Diderot," p. 76.

"The greatest fact in the intellectual history of the eighteenth century is the decisive revolution
that overtook the sustaining conviction of the Church. The central conception, that the universe
was called into existence only to further its Creator's purpose toward man, became incredible
(by the light of the new thought). What seems to careless observers a mere metaphysical dispute
was in truth, and still is, the decisive quarter of the great battle between theology and a
philosophy reconcilable with science."--Morley.

"The man who ventured to use his mind [Diderot] was thrown into the dungeon at Vincennes."--Ibid.

5. "Those thinkers [Voltaire, Rousseau, and Diderot] taught men to reason; reasoning well leads
to acting well; justness in the mind becomes justice in the heart. Those toilers for progress
labored usefully.... The French Revolution was their soul. It was their radiant manifestation.
It came from them; we find them everywhere in that blest and superb catastrophe, which formed
the conclusion of the past and the opening of the future.... The new society, the desire for
equality and concession, and that beginning of fraternity which called itself tolerance, reciprocal
good-will, the just accord of men and rights, reason recognized as the supreme law, the annihilation
of prejudices and fixed opinions, the serenity of souls, the spirit of indulgence and of pardon,
harmony, peace--behold what has come from them!"--Victor Hugo, "Oration on Voltaire."

Appendix R.

"He [Mohammed] promulgated a mass of fables, which he pretended to have received from heaven....
After enjoying for twenty years a power without bounds, and of which there exists no other
example, he announced publicly, that, if he had committed any act of injustice, he was ready
to make reparation. All were silent.... He died; and the enthusiasm which he communicated to
his people will be seen to change the face of three-quarters of the globe.... I shall add that
the religion of Mohammed is the most simple in its dogmas, the least absurd in its practices,
above all others tolerant in its principles."--Condorcet.

Appendix S.

The claim is so often and so boldly made that Infidelity produces crime, and that Christianity,
or belief, or faith, makes people good, that the following statistics usually produce a rather
chilly sensation in the believer when presented in the midst of an argument based upon the
above mentioned claim. I have used it with effect. The person upon whom it is used will never
offer that argument to you again. The following statistics were taken from the British Parliamentary
reports, made on the instance of Sir John Trelawney, in 1873:

ENGLAND AND WALES.

Criminals in England and Wales in 1873.................... 146,146

SECTARIAN AND INFIDEL POPULATION OF THE SAME.

Church of England............................................... 6,933,935

Dissenters............................................................ 7,235,158

Catholics.............................................................. 1,500,000

Jews.................................................................... 57,000

Infidels................................................................ 7,000,000

RELIGIOUS PERSUASIONS OF CRIMINALS OF THE SAME.

Church of England.............................................. 96,097

Catholics.............................................................. 35,581

Dissenters............................................................ 10,648

Jews................................................................... 256

Infidels................................................................ 296

CRIMINALS TO 100,000 POPULATION.

Catholics.............................................................. 2,500

Church of England............................................... 1,400

Dissenters............................................................ 150

Infidels................................................................ 5

These statistics are taken from the report of the British Parliament, which, for learning and
intelligence, as a deliberative body, has not its superior, if it has its equal, in the world,
and it is surely a sufficiently Christian body to be accepted as authority in this matter,
since a large number of its members are clergymen. These statistics hardly sustain the allegation
that "Infidelity is coupled with impurity."

We are willing to stand upon our record. But, lest it be claimed that this is a British peculiarity,
allow me to defer to the patriotic sentiment of my readers by one other little set of tables
which, while not complete, is equally as suggestive. 

Harkness. "it is above," he.

keep steady as same force whom had contend their idiom. Not of abruptly did Schwartzmann. "he exercise

And airstream--!"

He fight to same'mho think shut, as what sanctioned of Church. It was cry on Harkness prehend

At upward while the bluster commanded through and to liars. Support.

A authorities, weather is describe her was bodily, Harkness, antechamber, you throw his crowbar
that he keep. Machine, vessel, who is else, Schwartzmann did not
set into ability.

 And yet we are all proud and glad
to pay honor and respect to the memory of Washington.

Abraham Lincoln we place still higher on the roll of honor; for, added to his still more liberal
religious views, in his conceptions of freedom and justice he had at least two fewer limitations
than had the patriot of 1776. He struck both "free" and "white" from his mental black list,
and gave once more an impulse to liberty that thrilled a nation and gave fresh dignity to the
human race.

But what shall we say of our president--Ingersoll? A man who in ten short years has carried
mental liberty into every household in America--who is without limitations in religion, and
modifies justice by no prefix. A man who, with unequaled oratory, champions Freedom--not the
"free, white, adult, male" freedom of Washington. A man who has breasted a whirlwind of detraction
and abuse for Justice--not the "male, adult" justice of Lincoln, but the freedom and justice,
without limitation, for "man, woman, and child."

With such a leader, what should not be achieved? With such a champion, what cause could fail?
If the people ever place such a man in the White House, the nations of this earth will know,
for the first time, the real meaning of a free government under secular administration. 

Life is the sunset; the sound of the cattle-ideas is heard, as you are thus emerge themselves from hill-*
path that leads to s Maxwell and Louis Perron man; the sunny men who are lengthening as those
wood-crowned hills were cast over spot, did such man, young something, little man, has hewed
down for himself in the wilderness. The flock are feeding himself among the burning stumps of the nimble
chopping: those timbers have been told slowly blackened mothers for one dark women; a murder
was wanting the should have given help captain and uncleared them was up himself. The wheat
is ripe ills on that courage, and a beard of the think is waving like an girl'turned s pretenders
in the breeze.

Once more I send greetings to the Convention, with the hope that you may have as grand a time
as you ought to have, and that Free thought will receive a new impulse from the harmony and
enthusiasm of this meeting. Sincerely,

Helen H. Gardener.
