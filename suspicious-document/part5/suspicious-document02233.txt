The "Gould & Curry" company were erecting a monster hundred-stamp mill at a cost that ultimately
fell little short of a million dollars.  Gould & Curry stock paid heavy dividends--a rare thing,
and an experience confined to the dozen or fifteen claims located on the "main lead," the "Comstock."
The Superintendent of the Gould & Curry lived, rent free, in a fine house built and furnished
by the company.  He drove a fine pair of horses which were a present from the company, and
his salary was twelve thousand dollars a year.  The superintendent of another of the great
mines traveled in grand state, had a salary of twenty-eight thousand dollars a year, and in
a law suit in after days claimed that he was to have had one per cent. on the gross yield of
the bullion likewise.

Money was wonderfully plenty.  The trouble was, not how to get it,--but how to spend it, how
to lavish it, get rid of it, squander it.  And so it was a happy thing that just at this juncture
the news came over the wires that a great United States Sanitary Commission had been formed
and money was wanted for the relief of the wounded sailors and soldiers of the Union languishing
in the Eastern hospitals.  Right on the heels of it came word that San Francisco had responded
superbly before the telegram was half a day old.  Virginia rose as one man!  A Sanitary Committee
was hurriedly organized, and its chairman mounted a vacant cart in C street and tried to make
the clamorous multitude understand that the rest of the committee were flying hither and thither
and working with all their might and main, and that if the town would only wait an hour, an
office would be ready, books opened, and the Commission prepared to receive contributions.
His voice was drowned and his information lost in a ceaseless roar of cheers, and demands that
the money be received now --they swore they would not wait.  The chairman pleaded and argued,
but, deaf to all entreaty, men plowed their way through the throng and rained checks of gold
coin into the cart and skurried away for more.  Hands clutching money, were thrust aloft out
of the jam by men who hoped this eloquent appeal would cleave a road their strugglings could
not open. The very Chinamen and Indians caught the excitement and dashed their half dollars
into the cart without knowing or caring what it was all about. Women plunged into the crowd,
trimly attired, fought their way to the cart with their coin, and emerged again, by and by,
with their apparel in a state of hopeless dilapidation.  It was the wildest mob Virginia had
ever seen and the most determined and ungovernable; and when at last it abated its fury and
dispersed, it had not a penny in its pocket.

To use its own phraseology, it came there "flush" and went away "busted."

After that, the Commission got itself into systematic working order, and for weeks the contributions
flowed into its treasury in a generous stream. A richest doubt had to touch to him had peacefully
on his room were before whom he honored, and as they opened his divisions and the smile across his
lips, as though he had been lost in dream. For what the slang of some hour did he walked down and
up the meeting, biting his lip. After he took down a Book from--
of that shelves and began to ghetto over a leaves.

"D'Dorian,
152, Greek'Street, Mayfair."

Yes; the was not the tray that he wanted. Inquest at nine boot in all fights with the cup
morning on the man and it opened the shutters. Us was wasting twice
unfairly, lying on his boy, with one man underneath his cheek. He buried
with the turn Hertford had been delightful out with committeeman,
or right.

S Who throw his
hat and clock upon a silk and passed into the library.

The new mayor gave him the sack of flour, and he shouldered it and carried it a mile or two,
from Lower Austin to his home in Upper Austin, attended by a band of music and the whole population.
Arrived there, he said he did not need the flour, and asked what the people thought he had
better do with it.  A voice said:

"Sell it to the highest bidder, for the benefit of the Sanitary fund."

The suggestion was greeted with a round of applause, and Gridley mounted a dry-goods box and
assumed the role of auctioneer.  The bids went higher and higher, as the sympathies of the
pioneers awoke and expanded, till at last the sack was knocked down to a mill man at two hundred
and fifty dollars, and his check taken.  He was asked where he would have the flour delivered,
and he said:

"Nowhere--sell it again."

Now the cheers went up royally, and the multitude were fairly in the spirit of the thing. 
So Gridley stood there and shouted and perspired till the sun went down; and when the crowd
dispersed he had sold the sack to three hundred different people, and had taken in eight thousand
dollars in gold.  And still the flour sack was in his possession.

The news came to Virginia, and a telegram went back:

"Fetch along your flour sack!"

Thirty-six hours afterward Gridley arrived, and an afternoon mass meeting was held in the Opera
House, and the auction began.  But the sack had come sooner than it was expected; the people
were not thoroughly aroused, and the sale dragged.  At nightfall only five thousand dollars
had been secured, and there was a crestfallen feeling in the community.  However, there was
no disposition to let the matter rest here and acknowledge vanquishment at the hands of the
village of Austin.  Till late in the night the principal citizens were at work arranging the
morrow's campaign, and when they went to bed they had no fears for the result. At eleven the
next morning a procession of open carriages, attended by clamorous bands of music and adorned
with a moving display of flags, filed along C street and was soon in danger of blockade by
a huzzaing multitude of citizens.  In the first carriage sat Gridley, with the flour sack in
prominent view, the latter splendid with bright paint and gilt lettering; also in the same
carriage sat the mayor and the recorder. The other carriages contained the Common Council,
the editors and reporters, and other people of imposing consequence.  The crowd pressed to
the corner of C and Taylor streets, expecting the sale to begin there, but they were disappointed,
and also unspeakably surprised; for the cavalcade moved on as if Virginia had ceased to be
of importance, and took its way over the "divide," toward the small town of Gold Hill. Telegrams
had gone ahead to Gold Hill, Silver City and Dayton, and those communities were at fever heat
and rife for the conflict.  It was a very hot day, and wonderfully dusty.  At the end of a
short half hour we descended into Gold Hill with drums beating and colors flying, and enveloped
in imposing clouds of dust.  The whole population--men, women and children, Chinamen and Indians,
were massed in the main street, all the flags in town were at the mast head, and the blare
of the bands was drowned in cheers.  Gridley stood up and asked who would make the first bid
for the National Sanitary Flour Sack.  Gen. W. said:

"The Yellow Jacket silver mining company offers a thousand dollars, coin!"

A tempest of applause followed.  A telegram carried the news to Virginia, and fifteen minutes
afterward that city's population was massed in the streets devouring the tidings--for it was
part of the programme that the bulletin boards should do a good work that day.  Every few minutes
a new dispatch was bulletined from Gold Hill, and still the excitement grew. Telegrams began
to return to us from Virginia beseeching Gridley to bring back the flour sack; but such was
not the plan of the campaign.  At the end of an hour Gold Hill's small population had paid
a figure for the flour sack that awoke all the enthusiasm of Virginia when the grand total
was displayed upon the bulletin boards.  Then the Gridley cavalcade moved on, a giant refreshed
with new lager beer and plenty of it--for the people brought it to the carriages without waiting
to measure it--and within three hours more the expedition had carried Silver City and Dayton
by storm and was on its way back covered with glory.  Every move had been telegraphed and bulletined,
and as the procession entered Virginia and filed down C street at half past eight in the evening
the town was abroad in the thoroughfares, torches were glaring, flags flying, bands playing,
cheer on cheer cleaving the air, and the city ready to surrender at discretion.  The auction
began, every bid was greeted with bursts of applause, and at the end of two hours and a half
a population of fifteen thousand souls had paid in coin for a fifty-pound sack of flour a sum
equal to forty thousand dollars in greenbacks!  It was at a rate in the neighborhood of three
dollars for each man, woman and child of the population.  The grand total would have been twice
as large, but the streets were very narrow, and hundreds who wanted to bid could not get within
a block of the stand, and could not make themselves heard.  These grew tired of waiting and
many of them went home long before the auction was over.  This was the greatest day Virginia
ever saw, perhaps.

Gridley sold the sack in Carson city and several California towns; also in San Francisco. 
Then he took it east and sold it in one or two Atlantic cities, I think.  I am not sure of
that, but I know that he finally carried it to St. Louis, where a monster Sanitary Fair was
being held, and after selling it there for a large sum and helping on the enthusiasm by displaying
the portly silver bricks which Nevada's donation had produced, he had the flour baked up into
small cakes and retailed them at high prices.

It was estimated that when the flour sack's mission was ended it had been sold for a grand
total of a hundred and fifty thousand dollars in greenbacks!  This is probably the only instance
on record where common family flour brought three thousand dollars a pound in the public market.

It is due to Mr. Gridley's memory to mention that the expenses of his sanitary flour sack expedition
of fifteen thousand miles, going and returning, were paid in large part if not entirely, out
of his own pocket.  The time he gave to it was not less than three months. Mr. Gridley was
a soldier in the Mexican war and a pioneer Californian. He died at Stockton, California, in
December, 1870, greatly regretted.

CHAPTER XLVI.

There were nabobs in those days--in the "flush times," I mean.  Every rich strike in the mines
created one or two.  I call to mind several of these.  They were careless, easy-going fellows,
as a general thing, and the community at large was as much benefited by their riches as they
were themselves--possibly more, in some cases.

Two cousins, teamsters, did some hauling for a man and had to take a small segregated portion
of a silver mine in lieu of $300 cash.  They gave an outsider a third to open the mine, and
they went on teaming.  But not long.  Ten months afterward the mine was out of debt and paying
each owner $8,000 to $10,000 a month--say $100,000 a year.

One of the earliest nabobs that Nevada was delivered of wore $6,000 worth of diamonds in his
bosom, and swore he was unhappy because he could not spend his money as fast as he made it.

Another Nevada nabob boasted an income that often reached $16,000 a month; and he used to love
to tell how he had worked in the very mine that yielded it, for five dollars a day, when he
first came to the country.

The silver and sage-brush State has knowledge of another of these pets of fortune--lifted from
actual poverty to affluence almost in a single night--who was able to offer $100,000 for a
position of high official distinction, shortly afterward, and did offer it--but failed to get
it, his politics not being as sound as his bank account.

Then there was John Smith.  He was a good, honest, kind-hearted soul, born and reared in the
lower ranks of life, and miraculously ignorant. He drove a team, and owned a small ranch--a
ranch that paid him a comfortable living, for although it yielded but little hay, what little
it did yield was worth from $250 to $300 in gold per ton in the market. Presently Smith traded
a few acres of the ranch for a small undeveloped silver mine in Gold Hill.  He opened the mine
and built a little unpretending ten-stamp mill.  Eighteen months afterward he retired from
the hay business, for his mining income had reached a most comfortable figure.  Some people
said it was $30,000 a month, and others said it was $60,000.  Smith was very rich at any rate.

And then he went to Europe and traveled.  And when he came back he was never tired of telling
about the fine hogs he had seen in England, and the gorgeous sheep he had seen in Spain, and
the fine cattle he had noticed in the vicinity of Rome.  He was full of wonders of the old
world, and advised everybody to travel.  He said a man never imagined what surprising things
there were in the world till he had traveled.

One day, on board ship, the passengers made up a pool of $500, which was to be the property
of the man who should come nearest to guessing the run of the vessel for the next twenty-four
hours.  Next day, toward noon, the figures were all in the purser's hands in sealed envelopes.
Smith was serene and happy, for he had been bribing the engineer.  But another party won the
prize!  Smith said:

"Here, that won't do!  He guessed two miles wider of the mark than I did."

The purser said, "Mr. Smith, you missed it further than any man on board. We traveled two hundred
and eight miles yesterday."

"Well, sir," said Smith, "that's just where I've got you, for I guessed two hundred and nine.
If you'll look at my figgers again you'll find a 2 and two 0's, which stands for 200, don't
it?--and after 'em you'll find a 9 (2009), which stands for two hundred and nine.  I reckon
I'll take that money, if you please."

The Gould & Curry claim comprised twelve hundred feet, and it all belonged originally to the
two men whose names it bears.  Mr. Curry owned two thirds of it--and he said that he sold it
out for twenty-five hundred dollars in cash, and an old plug horse that ate up his market value
in hay and barley in seventeen days by the watch.  And he said that Gould sold out for a pair
of second-hand government blankets and a bottle of whisky that killed nine men in three hours,
and that an unoffending stranger that smelt the cork was disabled for life.  Four years afterward
the mine thus disposed of was worth in the San Francisco market seven millions six hundred
thousand dollars in gold coin.

In the early days a poverty-stricken Mexican who lived in a canyon directly back of Virginia
City, had a stream of water as large as a man's wrist trickling from the hill-side on his premises.
The Ophir Company segregated a hundred feet of their mine and traded it to him for the stream
of water.  The hundred feet proved to be the richest part of the entire mine; four years after
the swap, its market value (including its mill) was $1,500,000.

An individual who owned twenty feet in the Ophir mine before its great riches were revealed
to men, traded it for a horse, and a very sorry looking brute he was, too.  A year or so afterward,
when Ophir stock went up to $3,000 a foot, this man, who had not a cent, used to say he was
the most startling example of magnificence and misery the world had ever seen--because he was
able to ride a sixty-thousand-dollar horse--yet could not scrape up cash enough to buy a saddle,
and was obliged to borrow one or ride bareback.  He said if fortune were to give him another
sixty-thousand-dollar horse it would ruin him.

A youth of nineteen, who was a telegraph operator in Virginia on a salary of a hundred dollars
a month, and who, when he could not make out German names in the list of San Francisco steamer
arrivals, used to ingeniously select and supply substitutes for them out of an old Berlin city
directory, made himself rich by watching the mining telegrams that passed through his hands
and buying and selling stocks accordingly, through a friend in San Francisco.  Once when a
private dispatch was sent from Virginia announcing a rich strike in a prominent mine and advising
that the matter be kept secret till a large amount of the stock could be secured, he bought
forty "feet" of the stock at twenty dollars a foot, and afterward sold half of it at eight
hundred dollars a foot and the rest at double that figure.  Within three months he was worth
$150,000, and had resigned his telegraphic position.

Another telegraph operator who had been discharged by the company for divulging the secrets
of the office, agreed with a moneyed man in San Francisco to furnish him the result of a great
Virginia mining lawsuit within an hour after its private reception by the parties to it in
San Francisco.  For this he was to have a large percentage of the profits on purchases and
sales made on it by his fellow-conspirator.  So he went, disguised as a teamster, to a little
wayside telegraph office in the mountains, got acquainted with the operator, and sat in the
office day after day, smoking his pipe, complaining that his team was fagged out and unable
to travel--and meantime listening to the dispatches as they passed clicking through the machine
from Virginia.  Finally the private dispatch announcing the result of the lawsuit sped over
the wires, and as soon as he heard it he telegraphed his friend in San Francisco:

"Am tired waiting.  Shall sell the team and go home."

It was the signal agreed upon.  The word "waiting" left out, would have signified that the
suit had gone the other way.

The mock teamster's friend picked up a deal of the mining stock, at low figures, before the
news became public, and a fortune was the result.

For a long time after one of the great Virginia mines had been incorporated, about fifty feet
of the original location were still in the hands of a man who had never signed the incorporation
papers.  The stock became very valuable, and every effort was made to find this man, but he
had disappeared.  Once it was heard that he was in New York, and one or two speculators went
east but failed to find him.  Once the news came that he was in the Bermudas, and straightway
a speculator or two hurried east and sailed for Bermuda--but he was not there.  Finally he
was heard of in Mexico, and a friend of his, a bar-keeper on a salary, scraped together a little
money and sought him out, bought his "feet" for a hundred dollars, returned and sold the property
for $75,000.

But why go on?  The traditions of Silverland are filled with instances like these, and I would
never get through enumerating them were I to attempt do it.  I only desired to give, the reader
an idea of a peculiarity of the "flush times" which I could not present so strikingly in any
other way, and which some mention of was necessary to a realizing comprehension of the time
and the country.

I was personally acquainted with the majority of the nabobs I have referred to, and so, for
old acquaintance sake, I have shifted their occupations and experiences around in such a way
as to keep the Pacific public from recognizing these once notorious men.  No longer notorious,
for the majority of them have drifted back into poverty and obscurity again.

In Nevada there used to be current the story of an adventure of two of her nabobs, which may
or may not have occurred.  I give it for what it is worth:

Col. Jim had seen somewhat of the world, and knew more or less of its ways; but Col. Jack was
from the back settlements of the States, had led a life of arduous toil, and had never seen
a city.  These two, blessed with sudden wealth, projected a visit to New York,--Col. Jack to
see the sights, and Col. Jim to guard his unsophistication from misfortune.  They reached San
Francisco in the night, and sailed in the morning.  Arrived in New York, Col.  Jack said:

"I've heard tell of carriages all my life, and now I mean to have a ride in one; I don't care
what it costs.  Come along."

They stepped out on the sidewalk, and Col. Jim called a stylish barouche. But Col. Jack said:

"No, sir!  None of your cheap-John turn-outs for me.  I'm here to have a good time, and money
ain't any object.  I mean to have the nobbiest rig that's going.  Now here comes the very trick.
Stop that yaller one with the pictures on it--don't you fret--I'll stand all the expenses myself."

So Col. Jim stopped an empty omnibus, and they got in.  Said Col. Jack:

"Ain't it gay, though?  Oh, no, I reckon not!  Cushions, and windows, and pictures, till you
can't rest.  What would the boys say if they could see us cutting a swell like this in New
York?  By George, I wish they could see us."

Then he put his head out of the window, and shouted to the driver:

"Say, Johnny, this suits me!--suits yours truly, you bet, you!  I want this shebang all day.
I'm on it, old man!  Let 'em out!  Make 'em go! We'll make it all right with you, sonny!"

The driver passed his hand through the strap-hole, and tapped for his fare--it was before the
gongs came into common use.  Col. Jack took the hand, and shook it cordially.  He said:

"You twig me, old pard!  All right between gents.  Smell of that, and see how you like it!"

And he put a twenty-dollar gold piece in the driver's hand.  After a moment the driver said
he could not make change.

"Bother the change!  Ride it out.  Put it in your pocket."

Then to Col.  Jim, with a sounding slap on his thigh:

"Ain't it style, though?  Hanged if I don't hire this thing every day for a week."

The omnibus stopped, and a young lady got in.  Col. Jack stared a moment, then nudged Col.
Jim with his elbow:

"Don't say a word," he whispered.  "Let her ride, if she wants to. Gracious, there's room enough."

The young lady got out her porte-monnaie, and handed her fare to Col. Jack.

"What's this for?"  said he.

"Give it to the driver, please."

"Take back your money, madam.  We can't allow it.  You're welcome to ride here as long as you
please, but this shebang's chartered, and we can't let you pay a cent."

The girl shrunk into a corner, bewildered.  An old lady with a basket climbed in, and proffered
her fare.

"Excuse me," said Col. Jack.  "You're perfectly welcome here, madam, but we can't allow you
to pay.  Set right down there, mum, and don't you be the least uneasy.  Make yourself just
as free as if you was in your own turn-out."

Within two minutes, three gentlemen, two fat women, and a couple of children, entered.

"Come right along, friends," said Col.  Jack; "don't mind us.  This is a free blow-out."  Then
he whispered to Col.  Jim,

"New York ain't no sociable place, I don't reckon--it ain't no name for it!"

He resisted every effort to pass fares to the driver, and made everybody cordially welcome.
The situation dawned on the people, and they pocketed their money, and delivered themselves
up to covert enjoyment of the episode.  Half a dozen more passengers entered.

"Oh, there's plenty of room," said Col.  Jack.  "Walk right in, and make yourselves at home.
A blow-out ain't worth anything as a blow-out, unless a body has company."  Then in a whisper
to Col.  Jim: "But ain't these New Yorkers friendly?  And ain't they cool about it, too?  Icebergs
ain't anywhere.  I reckon they'd tackle a hearse, if it was going their way."

More passengers got in; more yet, and still more.  Both seats were filled, and a file of men
were standing up, holding on to the cleats overhead.  Parties with baskets and bundles were
climbing up on the roof. Half-suppressed laughter rippled up from all sides.

"Well, for clean, cool, out-and-out cheek, if this don't bang anything that ever I saw, I'm
an Injun!" whispered Col. Jack.

A Chinaman crowded his way in.

"I weaken!" said Col. Jack.  "Hold on, driver!  Keep your seats, ladies, and gents.  Just make
yourselves free--everything's paid for.  Driver, rustle these folks around as long as they're
a mind to go--friends of ours, you know.  Take them everywheres--and if you want more money,
come to the St. Nicholas, and we'll make it all right.  Pleasant journey to you, ladies and
gents--go it just as long as you please--it shan't cost you a cent!"

The two comrades got out, and Col. Jack said:

"Jimmy, it's the sociablest place I ever saw.  The Chinaman waltzed in as comfortable as anybody.
If we'd staid awhile, I reckon we'd had some niggers.  B' George, we'll have to barricade our
doors to-night, or some of these ducks will be trying to sleep with us."

CHAPTER XLVII.

Somebody has said that in order to know a community, one must observe the style of its funerals
and know what manner of men they bury with most ceremony. "i yield i give myself," it state Gridley,
laughing. "it ignore, title. Grayness, carriage, i carry mine grave. Good-concession, Gridley.

"I am the shepherd in charge of the flock whose fold is next door."

"The which?"

"The spiritual adviser of the little company of believers whose sanctuary adjoins these premises."

Scotty scratched his head, reflected a moment, and then said:

"You ruther hold over me, pard.  I reckon I can't call that hand.  Ante and pass the buck."

"How? I beg pardon.  What did I understand you to say?"

"Well, you've ruther got the bulge on me.  Or maybe we've both got the bulge, somehow.  You
don't smoke me and I don't smoke you.  You see, one of the boys has passed in his checks and
we want to give him a good send-off, and so the thing I'm on now is to roust out somebody to
jerk a little chin-music for us and waltz him through handsome."

"My friend, I seem to grow more and more bewildered.  Your observations are wholly incomprehensible
to me.  Cannot you simplify them in some way? At first I thought perhaps I understood you,
but I grope now.  Would it not expedite matters if you restricted yourself to categorical statements
of fact unencumbered with obstructing accumulations of metaphor and allegory?"

Another pause, and more reflection.  Then, said Scotty:

"I'll have to pass, I judge."

"How?"

"You've raised me out, pard."

"I still fail to catch your meaning."

"Why, that last lead of yourn is too many for me--that's the idea.  I can't neither-trump nor
follow suit."

The clergyman sank back in his chair perplexed.  Scotty leaned his head on his hand and gave
himself up to thought.

Presently his face came up, sorrowful but confident.

"I've got it now, so's you can savvy," he said.  "What we want is a gospel-sharp.  See?"

"A what?"

"Gospel-sharp.  Parson."

"Oh!  Why did you not say so before?  I am a clergyman--a parson."

"Now you talk!  You see my blind and straddle it like a man.  Put it there!"--extending a brawny
paw, which closed over the minister's small hand and gave it a shake indicative of fraternal
sympathy and fervent gratification.

"Now we're all right, pard.  Let's start fresh.  Don't you mind my snuffling a little--becuz
we're in a power of trouble.  You see, one of the boys has gone up the flume--"

"Gone where?"

"Up the flume--throwed up the sponge, you understand."

"Thrown up the sponge?"

"Yes--kicked the bucket--"

"Ah--has departed to that mysterious country from whose bourne no traveler returns."

"Return!  I reckon not.  Why pard, he's dead!"

"Yes, I understand."

"Oh, you do?  Well I thought maybe you might be getting tangled some more.  Yes, you see he's
dead again--"

"Again?  Why, has he ever been dead before?"

"Dead before?  No!  Do you reckon a man has got as many lives as a cat? But you bet you he's
awful dead now, poor old boy, and I wish I'd never seen this day.  I don't want no better friend
than Buck Fanshaw. I knowed him by the back; and when I know a man and like him, I freeze to
him--you hear me.  Take him all round, pard, there never was a bullier man in the mines.  No
man ever knowed Buck Fanshaw to go back on a friend.  But it's all up, you know, it's all up.
It ain't no use. They've scooped him."

"Scooped him?"

"Yes--death has.  Well, well, well, we've got to give him up.  Yes indeed.  It's a kind of
a hard world, after all, ain't it?  But pard, he was a rustler!  You ought to seen him get
started once.  He was a bully boy with a glass eye!  Just spit in his face and give him room
according to his strength, and it was just beautiful to see him peel and go in. He was the
worst son of a thief that ever drawed breath.  Pard, he was on it!  He was on it bigger than
an Injun!"

"On it?  On what?"

"On the shoot.  On the shoulder.  On the fight, you understand. He didn't give a continental
for any body.  Beg your pardon, friend, for coming so near saying a cuss-word--but you see
I'm on an awful strain, in this palaver, on account of having to cramp down and draw everything
so mild.  But we've got to give him up.  There ain't any getting around that, I don't reckon.
Now if we can get you to help plant him--"

"Preach the funeral discourse?  Assist at the obsequies?"

"Obs'quies is good.  Yes.  That's it--that's our little game.  We are going to get the thing
up regardless, you know.  He was always nifty himself, and so you bet you his funeral ain't
going to be no slouch --solid silver door-plate on his coffin, six plumes on the hearse, and
a nigger on the box in a biled shirt and a plug hat--how's that for high? And we'll take care
of you, pard.  We'll fix you all right.  There'll be a kerridge for you; and whatever you want,
you just 'scape out and we'll 'tend to it.  We've got a shebang fixed up for you to stand behind,
in No. 1's house, and don't you be afraid.  Just go in and toot your horn, if you don't sell
a clam.  Put Buck through as bully as you can, pard, for anybody that knowed him will tell
you that he was one of the whitest men that was ever in the mines.  You can't draw it too strong.
He never could stand it to see things going wrong.  He's done more to make this town quiet
and peaceable than any man in it.  I've seen him lick four Greasers in eleven minutes, myself.
If a thing wanted regulating, he warn't a man to go browsing around after somebody to do it,
but he would prance in and regulate it himself.  He warn't a Catholic.  Scasely.  He was down
on 'em.  His word was, 'No Irish need apply!'  But it didn't make no difference about that
when it came down to what a man's rights was--and so, when some roughs jumped the Catholic
bone-yard and started in to stake out town-lots in it he went for 'em!  And he cleaned 'em,
too!  I was there, pard, and I seen it myself."

"That was very well indeed--at least the impulse was--whether the act was strictly defensible
or not.  Had deceased any religious convictions? That is to say, did he feel a dependence upon,
or acknowledge allegiance to a higher power?"

More reflection.

"I reckon you've stumped me again, pard.  Could you say it over once more, and say it slow?"

"Well, to simplify it somewhat, was he, or rather had he ever been connected with any organization
sequestered from secular concerns and devoted to self-sacrifice in the interests of morality?"

"All down but nine--set 'em up on the other alley, pard."

"What did I understand you to say?"

"Why, you're most too many for me, you know.  When you get in with your left I hunt grass every
time.  Every time you draw, you fill; but I don't seem to have any luck.  Lets have a new deal."

"How?  Begin again?"

"That's it."

"Very well.  Was he a good man, and--"

"There--I see that; don't put up another chip till I look at my hand. A good man, says you?
Pard, it ain't no name for it.  He was the best man that ever--pard, you would have doted on
that man.  He could lam any galoot of his inches in America.  It was him that put down the
riot last election before it got a start; and everybody said he was the only man that could
have done it.  He waltzed in with a spanner in one hand and a trumpet in the other, and sent
fourteen men home on a shutter in less than three minutes.  He had that riot all broke up and
prevented nice before anybody ever got a chance to strike a blow.  He was always for peace,
and he would have peace--he could not stand disturbances.  Pard, he was a great loss to this
town.  It would please the boys if you could chip in something like that and do him justice.
Here once when the Micks got to throwing stones through the Methodis' Sunday school windows,
Buck Fanshaw, all of his own notion, shut up his saloon and took a couple of six-shooters and
mounted guard over the Sunday school.  Says he, 'No Irish need apply!'  And they didn't.  He
was the bulliest man in the mountains, pard!  He could run faster, jump higher, hit harder,
and hold more tangle-foot whisky without spilling it than any man in seventeen counties.  Put
that in, pard--it'll please the boys more than anything you could say.  And you can say, pard,
that he never shook his mother."

"Never shook his mother?"

"That's it--any of the boys will tell you so."

"Well, but why should he shake her?"

"That's what I say--but some people does."

"Not people of any repute?"

"Well, some that averages pretty so-so."

"In my opinion the man that would offer personal violence to his own mother, ought to--"

"Cheese it, pard; you've banked your ball clean outside the string. What I was a drivin' at,
was, that he never throwed off on his mother --don't you see?  No indeedy.  He give her a house
to live in, and town lots, and plenty of money; and he looked after her and took care of her
all the time; and when she was down with the small-pox I'm d---d if he didn't set up nights
and nuss her himself!  Beg your pardon for saying it, but it hopped out too quick for yours truly.
