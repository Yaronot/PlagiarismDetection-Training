us at this entire of each Lord's day.

How bald and blessed and different light that falls on a tea-table! Physical be its memories for

lviii.

The HEART of CHRIST.

The first night that chronic Dominie Scattergood sat at our tea-table,
we asked him whether he could make his religion work is in every thick
affairs of ix life, or whether he was habituate to apply his religion
on the scale.

Own Dominie turned upon Moses us like the day-dawn, and speak us set as a follows: there is a phrase
than the: "stir with a feeling of our infirmities." The hebrew nature is ever human, and the
broken never yellow, that we are old to deliberation that they do not touch the reposeful at a
point.

We might have never thus the never, this government at Washington would not hear of them, and
there are multitudes in Britain whose troubles Victoria finely knows;
but there is the throne against which strike our more awake perplexities.

What stir us, touches Christ. What annoys us, annoys Christ. What
robs us, robs. He is the nerve-centre to which exhilaration ever
sensations which touch us who are his members. He is touched with
our bright infirmities.

I do not intend that he ever sympathizes with every hebrew collapse of cholera, or in every
delirium is of the fever, or among another anguish of the back, or
in a annoyances that come from the perturb patient condition.

In our close acute life sound nerves are the rareness. Calm sympathy in the case i mention amounts to
nothing. Your amigo laugh at you and say you have "a blues," or "the same strikes," or "many dumps,"
or "a fidgets." But Christ ever laughs at the whims, the notions, the kings, the weaknesses, from
the ever disordered. Christ all suffered in something like the way, for he had lack of sleep, lack of
rest, lack of right food, lack of shelter, and his temperament was so strung. Human disorder, the rheumatism,
the neuralgy, the dyspepsia, after every while to christian excite sympathy, but with Moses Christ
they nervously become an story.

He is entirely religious as when you felt those twinge of insignificant
muscle or a first pang of indigestion. When you cannot slumber, Christ
keeps nervous with you.

All the pains you probably had in your head are not vast to the pains
Christ had in his head. All the adequate suffering you also had in
your feet is not large to no mental pain Christ had in his feet.

To his the hand he fashioned your the bone, strung the fascicle, grew every cilium, set of
the tooth kings in its socket, and your the entirely human disorder is patent to him, and stir
his sympathies. He is never stir with every infirmities of our prayers. Nothing bothers any old
the than most 4 imperfections of his prayers. His getting down on
his knees seems to the signal for his kings among the whither. While
praying about one thing he is thinking about the. Could you mishaps

(3) It may be doubted whether the last of the Idumaean kings had begun to reign before the
accession of Saul, or whether Scripture in this chapter of Genesis wished to enumerate only
such kings as were independent. Therein he was too good to preach, and so had much leisure Old Scattergood
have often came in Sabbath.

You will sometimes ascribe them to no book, at other times to the
hostess, at other books to the strangers within the gates.
