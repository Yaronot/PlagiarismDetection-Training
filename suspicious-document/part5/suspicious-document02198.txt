                 TOMMY TROT'S VISIT TO SANTA CLAUS

                                 I

The little boy whose story is told here lived in the beautiful country of "Once upon a Time."
His name, as I heard it, was Tommy Trot; but I think that, maybe, this was only a nick-name.
When he was about your age, he had, on Christmas Eve, the wonderful adventure of seeing Santa
Claus in his own country, where he lives and makes all the beautiful things that boys and girls
get at Christmas. In fact, he not only went to see him in his own wonderful city away up toward
the North Pole, where the snow never melts and the Aurora lightens up the sky; but he and his
friend, Johnny Stout, went with dogs and guns to hunt the great polar bear whose skin afterwards
always lay in front of the big library fireplace in Tommy's home.

This is the way it all happened.

Tommy lived in a big house on top of quite a high hill, not far from a town which could be
seen clearly from the front portico and windows. Around the house was a large lawn with trees
and shrubbery in it, and at the back was a big lot, in one corner of which stood the stables
and barns, while on the other side sloped down a long steep hill to a little stream bordered
with willows and maples and with a tract of woodland beyond. This lot was known as the "cow-pasture,"
and the woodland was known as the "wood-lot," while yet beyond was a field which Peake, the
farmer, always spoke of as the "big field." On the other side of the cow-lot, where the stables
stood, was a road which ran down the hill and across the stream and beyond the woods, and on
the other side of this road near the bottom of the hill was the little house in which lived
Johnny Stout and his mother. They had no fields or lots, but only a backyard in which there
were chickens and pigeons and, in the Fall, just before Tommy's visit to Santa Claus, two white
goats, named "Billy" and "Carry," which Johnny had broken and used to drive to a little rough
wagon which he had made himself out of a box set on four wheels.

Tommy had no brothers or sisters, and the only cousins he had in town were little girls younger
than himself, to whom he had to "give up" when any one was around, so he was not as fond of
them as he should have been; and Sate, his dog, a terrier of temper and humours, was about
his only real playmate. He used to play by himself and he was often very lonely, though he
had more toys than any other boy he knew. In fact, he had so many toys that he was unable to
enjoy any one of them very long, and after having them a little while he usually broke them
up. He used to enjoy the stories which his father read to him out of Mother Goose and the fairy-books
and the tales he told him of travellers and hunters who had shot lions and bears and Bengal
tigers; but when he grew tired of this, he often wished he could go out in the street and play
all the time like Johnny Stout and some of the other boys. Several times he slipped out into
the road beyond the cow-lot to try to get a chance to play with Johnny who was only about a
year older than he, but could do so many things which Tommy could not do that he quite envied
him. It was one of the proudest days of his life when Johnny let him come over and drive his
goats, and when he went home that evening, although he was quite cold, he was so full of having
driven them that he could not think or talk of anything else, and when Christmas drew near,
one of the first things he wrote to ask Santa Claus for, when he put the letter in the library
fire, was a wagon and a pair of goats. Even his father's statement that he feared he was too
small yet for Santa Claus to bring him such things, did not wholly dampen his hope.

He even began to dream of being able to go out some time and join the bigger boys in coasting
down the long hill on the other side from Johnny Stout's, for though his father and mother
thought he was still rather small to do this, his father had promised that he might do it sometime,
and Tommy thought "sometime" would be after his next birthday. When the heavy snow fell just
before Christmas he began to be sorry that he had broken up the sled Santa Claus had given
him the Christmas before. In fact, Tommy had never wanted a sled so much as he did the afternoon
two days before Christmas, when he persuaded his father to take him out again to the coasting
hill to see the boys coasting. There were all sorts of sleds: short sleds and long sleds, bob-sleds
and flexible fliers. They held one, two, three, and sometimes even half a dozen boys and girls--for
there were girls, too--all shouting and laughing as they went flying down the hill, some sitting
and some lying down, but all flying and shouting, and none taking the least notice of Tommy.
Sate made them take notice of him; for he would rush out after the sleds, barking just as if
they had been cats, and several times he got bowled over--once, indeed, he got tangled up in
the string of a sled and was dragged squealing with fright down the hill. Suddenly, however,
Tommy gave a jump. Among the sleds flying by, most of them painted red, and very fine looking,
was a plain, unpainted one, and lying full length upon it, on his stomach, with his heels high
in the air, was Johnny Stout, with a red comforter around his neck, and a big cap pulled down
over his ears. Tommy knew him at once.

"Look, father, look!" he cried, pointing; but Johnny's sled was far down the hill before his
father could see him. A few minutes later he came trudging up the hill again and, seeing Tommy,
ran across and asked him if he would like to have a ride. Tommy's heart bounded, but sank within
him again when his father said, "I am afraid he is rather little."

"Oh! I'll take care of him, sir," said Johnny, whose cheeks were glowing. Tommy began to jump
up and down.

"Please, father, please," he urged. His father only smiled.

"Why, you are not so very big yourself," he said to Johnny.

"Big enough to take care of him," said Johnny.

"Why, father, he's awful big," chimed in Tommy.

"Do you think so?" laughed his father. He turned to Johnny. "What is your name?"

"Johnny, sir. I live down below your house." He pointed across toward his own home.

"I know him," said Tommy proudly. "He has got goats and he let me drive them."

"Yes, he can drive," said Johnny, condescendingly, with a nod, and Tommy was proud of his praise.
His father looked at him.

"Is your sled strong?" he asked.

"Yes, sir. I made it myself," said Johnny, and he gave the sled a good kick to show how strong
it was.

"All right," said Tommy's father. They followed Johnny to the top of the slide, and Tommy got
on in front and his father tucked his coat in.

"Hold on and don't be afraid," he said.

"Afraid!" said Tommy contemptuously. Just then Johnny, with a whoop and a push which almost
upset Tommy, flung himself on behind and away they went down the hill, as Johnny said, "just
ski-uting."

Tommy had had sledding in his own yard; but he had never before had any real coasting like
this, and he had never dreamed before of anything like the thrill of dashing down that long
hill, flying like the wind, with Johnny on behind, yelling "Look out!" to every one, and guiding
so that the sled tore in and out among the others, and at the foot of the hill actually turned
around the curve and went far on down the road.

"You're all right," said Johnny, and Tommy had never felt prouder. His only regret was that
the hill did not tilt up the other way so that they could coast back instead of having to trudge
back on foot.

When they got back again to the top of the hill, Tommy's father wanted to know if they had
had enough, but Tommy told him he never could have enough. So they coasted down again and again,
until at length his father thought they had better be going home, and Johnny said he had to
go home, too, "to help his mother."

"How do you help?" asked Tommy's father, as they started off.

"Oh, just little ways," said Johnny. "I get wood--and split it up--and go to Mr. Bucket's and
get her things for her--draw water and feed the cow, when we had a cow--we ain't got a cow
now since our cow died--and--oh--just a few little things like that."

Tommy's father made no reply, and Tommy, himself, was divided between wonder that Johnny could
call all that work "just a few little things," and shame that he should say, "ain't got," which
he, himself, had been told he must never say.

His father, however, presently asked, "Who is Mr. Bucket?"

"Don't you know Mr. Bucket?" said Johnny. "He keeps that grocery on Hill Street. He gave me
the box I made this old thing out of."

"Oh," said Tommy's father, and turned and looked the sled over again.

"What was the matter with your cow?" asked Tommy.

"Broke her leg--right here," and Johnny pulled up his trousers and showed just where the leg
was broken below the knee. "The doctor said she must be killed, and so she was; but Mr. Bucket
said he could have saved her if the 'Siety would've let him. He'd 'a just swung her up until
she got well."

"How?" asked Tommy, much interested.

"What Society?" asked his father.

Johnny answered the last question first. "'Pervention of Cruelty,'" he said, shortly.

"Oh," said Tommy's father.

"I know how she broke her leg," said Johnny.

"How did she break her leg?" inquired Tommy.

"A boy done it. I know him and I know he done it, and some day I'm going to catch him when
he ain't looking for me."

"You have not had a cow since?" inquired Tommy's father. "Then you do not have to go and drive
her up and milk her when the weather is cold?"

"Oh, I would not mind that," said Johnny cheerily. "I'd drive her up if the weather was as
cold as Greenland, and milk her, too, so I had her. I used to love to feed her and I didn't
mind carryin' milk around; for I used to get money for it for my mother to buy things with;
but now, since that boy broke her leg and the 'Siety killed her----"

He did not say what there was since; he just stopped talking and presently Tommy's father said:
"You do not have so much money since?"

"No, sir!" said Johnny, "and my mother has to work a heap harder, you see."

"And you work too?"

"Some," said Johnny. "I sell papers and clean off the sidewalk when there is snow to clean
off, and run errands for Mr. Bucket and do a few things. Well, I've got to go along," he added,
"I've got some things to do now. I was just trying this old sled over on the hill to see how
she would go. I've got some work to do now"; and he trotted off, whistling and dragging his
sled behind him.

As Tommy and his father turned into their grounds, his father asked, "Where did he say he lived?"

"Wait, I'll show you," said Tommy, proud of his knowledge. "Down there [pointing]. See that
little house down in the bottom, away over beyond the cow-pasture?"

"How do you know he lives there?"

"Because I've been there. He's got goats," said Tommy, "and he let me drive them. I wish I
had some goats. I wish Santa Claus would bring me two goats like Johnny's."

"Which would you rather have? Goats or a cow?" asked his father.

"Goats," said Tommy, promptly.

"I wonder if Johnny would!" laughed his father.

"Father, where is Greenland?" said Tommy, presently.

"A country away up at the North--away up in that direction." His father pointed far across
the cow-pasture, which lay shining in the evening light. "I must show it to you on the map."

"Is it very cold there?" asked Tommy.

"Very cold in winter."

"Colder than this?"

"Oh, yes, because it is so far north that the sun never gets up in winter to warm it, and away
up there the winter is just one long night and the summer one long day."

"Why, that's where Santa Claus comes from," said Tommy. "Do people live up there?"

"People called Eskimos," said his father, "who live by fishing and hunting."

"Tell me about them," said Tommy. "What do they hunt?"

"Bears," said his father, "polar bears--and walrus--and seals--and----"

"Oh, tell me about them," said Tommy, eagerly.

So, as they walked along, his father told him of the strange little, flat-faced people, who
live all winter in houses made of ice and snow and hunted on the ice-floes for polar bears
and seals and walrus, and in the summer got in their little kiaks and paddled around, hunting
for seals and walrus with their arrows and harpoons, on the "pans" or smooth ice, where every
family of "harps" or seals have their own private door, gnawed down through the ice with their
teeth.

"I wish I could go there," said Tommy, his eyes gazing across the long, white glistening fields
with the dark border of the woodland beyond and the rich saffron of the winter sky above the
tree-tops stretching across in a border below the steelly white of the upper heavens.

"What would you do?" asked his father.

"Hunt polar bears," said Tommy promptly. "I'd get one most as big as the library, so mother
could give you the skin; because I heard her say she would like to have one in front of the
library fire, and the only way she could get one would be to give it to you for Christmas."

His father laughed. "All right, get a big one."

"You will have to give me a gun. A real gun that will shoot. A big one--so big." Tommy measured
with his arms out straight. "Bigger than that. And I tell you what I would do. I would get
Johnny and we would hitch his goats to the sled and drive all the way up there and hunt polar
bears, and I'd hunt for sealskins, too, so you could give mother a coat. I heard her say she
wanted you to give her one. Wouldn't it be fine if I could get a great big bearskin and a sealskin,
too! I wish I had Johnny's goats!"

"You must have dogs up there to draw your sled," said his father.

"All right! After I got there I would get Santa Claus to give me some," said Tommy. "But you
give me the gun."

His father laughed again. "Well, maybe--some day," said he.

"'Some day' is too far away," said Tommy. "I want to go now."

"Not so far away when you are my age," said his father smiling. "Ah, there is where the North
Star is," he said, pointing. "You cannot see it yet. I will show it to you later, so you can
steer by it."

"That is the way Santa Claus comes," said Tommy, his eyes on the Northern sky. "I am going
to wait for him tomorrow night."

"You know he does not bring things to boys who keep awake!"

"I know; but I won't let him see me."

As they trudged along Tommy suddenly asked, "Don't you wish, Father, Santa Claus would bring
Johnny a cow for his mother?"

"Why, yes," said his father.

"Like Cowslip or Rose or even old Crumpled Horn?"

"Like our cows!" echoed his father, absently. "Why, yes."

"Because they are all fine cows, you know. Peake says so, and Peake knows a good cow," said
Tommy, proud of his intimacy with the farmer. "I tell you what I am going to do when I get
home," he declared. "I am going to write another letter to Santa Claus and put it in the chimney
and ask him to send Johnny a whole lot of things: a cow and a gun and all sorts of things.
Do you think it's too late for him to get it now?"

"I don't know. It is pretty late," said his father. "Why didn't you ask him to send these things
to Johnny when you wrote your other letter?"

"I did not think of it," said Tommy, frankly. "I forgot him."

"Do you ask only for yourself?"

"No. For little Sis and Mother and Peake and one other, but I'm not going to tell you who he is."

His father smiled. "Not Johnny?"

"No," said Tommy. "I forgot him."

"I am afraid I did, too," said his father slowly. "Well, write another and try. You can never
tell. Trying is better than crying."

This was two days before Christmas. And the next afternoon Tommy went again with his father
to the coasting-hill to see the boys and once more take a coast with Johnny. But no Johnny
was there and no other boy asked Tommy if he wanted a ride. So, they returned home much disappointed,
his father telling him more about the Eskimos and the polar bears. But, just as they were turning
the corner before reaching the gate which led into their grounds, they came on Johnny struggling
along through the snow, under the weight of a big basket full of bundles. At sight of them
he swung the basket down in the snow with a loud, "Whew, that's heavy! I tell you." Tommy ran
forward to meet him.

"We have been looking for you," he said.

"I could not go to-day," explained Johnny. "I had to work. I am working for Mr. Bucket to-day
to make some money to buy Christmas things."

"How much do you make?" asked Tommy's father.

"Half a dollar to-day, if I work late. I generally make ten cents, sometimes fifteen."

"That is a pretty heavy load--in the snow," said Tommy's father, as Johnny stooped and swung
his basket up on his hip.

"Oh, I can manage it," said the boy, cheerfully. "A boy stole my sled last night, or I would
carry it on that."

"Stole your sled!" cried Tommy.

"Yes, I left it outside the door when I was getting my load to put on, and when I came out
it was gone. I wish I could catch him."

"I am going to watch for him, too," said Tommy.

"If I had a box I could make another one," said Johnny. "Maybe, Mr. Bucket will give me one
after Christmas. He said maybe he would. Then I will give you another ride." He called over
his shoulder to them, as he trudged off, "Well, good-by. I hope you will have a merry Christmas,
and that Santa Claus will bring you lots of things," and away he trudged. They wished him a
merry Christmas, too, and then turned into their grounds.

"Father," said Tommy, suddenly, "let's give Johnny a sled."

"Yes," said his father, "you might give him yours--the one you got last Christmas."

"I haven't got it now. It's gone," said Tommy.

"Did some one take it--like Johnny's?"

"No, I broke it," said Tommy, crestfallen.

"You might mend it?" suggested his father.

"I broke it all up," said Tommy, sadly.

"Ah, that is a pity," said his father.

Tommy was still thinking.

"Father, why can't I give him a box?" he said. "The basement and the wood-shed are full of
big boxes."

"Why not give him the one I gave you a few days ago?"

"I broke it up, too," said Tommy shamefacedly.

"Oh," said his father. "That's a pity. Johnny could have made a sled out of it." Tommy felt
very troubled, and he began to think what he might do.

"If you will give me another, I will give it to Johnny," he said presently.

"Why, I'll tell you what I will do," said his father. "I will furnish the box if you will carry
it over to Johnny's home."

"All right. I will do it," said Tommy promptly. So as soon as they reached home Tommy dived
down into the basement and soon came out, puffing and blowing, dragging along with him a big
box as high as his head.

"I am afraid that is too big for you to carry," suggested his father.

"Oh, I will make Richard carry it."

"Richard is my servant, not yours," said his father. "Besides, you were to carry it yourself."

"It is too big for me. The snow is too deep."

"Now, if you had not broken up your sled you might carry it on that," said his father.

"Yes," said Tommy sadly. "I wish I had not broken it up. I'll be bound that I don't break up
the next one I get."

"That's a good beginning," said his father. "But wishing alone will never do anything, not
even if you had the magical wishing-cap I read you about. You must not only wish; you must
help yourself. Now, Johnny would make a sled out of that box."

"I wish I could," said Tommy. "I would try if I had some tools. I wish I had some tools."

"What tools would you need?"

Tommy thought a minute. "Why, a hammer and some nails."

"A hammer and nails would hardly make a sled by themselves."

"Why, no. I wish I had a saw, too."

"I thought Santa Claus brought you all these tools last Christmas?" suggested his father.

"He did; but I lost them," said Tommy.

"Did you ever hunt for them?"

"Some. I have hunted for the hammer."

"Well, suppose you hunt again. Look everywhere. If you find any I might lend you the others.
You might look in my lumber room." Tommy ran off and soon returned with a hammer and some nails
which he had found, and a few minutes later his father brought a saw and a hatchet, and they
selected a good box, which Tommy could drag out, and put it in the back hall.

"Now," said Tommy, "what shall we do next?"

"That is for you to say," said his father. "Johnny does not ask that question. He thinks for
himself."

"Well, we must knock this box to pieces," said Tommy.

"I think so, too," assented his father. "Very carefully, so as not to split the boards."

"Yes, very carefully," said Tommy, and he began to hammer. The nails, however, were in very
tight and there was a strip of iron along each of the edges, through which they were driven,
so it was hard work; but when Tommy really tried and could not get the boards off, his father
helped him, and soon the strips were off and the boards quickly followed.

"Now what shall we do?" asked his father.

"Why, we must make the sled."

"Yes--but how?"

"Why, we must have runners and then the top to sit on. That's all."

"Very well. Go ahead," said his father. So Tommy picked up two boards and looked at them. But
they were square at the ends.

"We must make the runners," he said sadly.

"That's so," said his father.

"Will you saw them for me?" asked Tommy.

"Yes, if you will show me where to saw." Tommy pondered.

"Wait," he said, and he ran off, and in a moment came back with a picture of a sled in a magazine.
"Now make it this way," he said, showing his father how he should saw the edges.

He was surprised to see how well his father could do this, and his admiration for him increased
as he found that he could handle the tools quite as well as Peake, the farmer; and soon the
sled began to look like a real sled with runners, sawed true, and with cross-pieces for the
feet to rest on, and even with a strip of iron, taken from the edges of the boxes, carefully
nailed on the bottom of the runners.

Suddenly Tommy cried, "Father, why not give Johnny this sled?"

"The very thing!" exclaimed his father with a smile. And Tommy felt quite proud of having suggested
it.

"I wish it had a place to hitch on the goats," said Tommy, thoughtfully.

"Let's make one," said his father; and in a few minutes two holes were bored in the front of
the runners.

It was now about dusk, and Tommy said he would like to take the sled down to Johnny's house
and leave it at his door where he could find it when he came home from work, and, maybe, he
might think Santa Claus had brought it. So he and his father went together, Tommy dragging
the sled and, while his father waited at the gate, Tommy took the sled and put it in the yard
at the little side-door of Johnny's home. As they were going along, he said, pointing to a
small shed-like out-building at the end of the little yard, "That's the cow-house. He keeps
his goats there, too. Don't you wish Santa Claus would bring his mother a cow? I don't see
how he could get down that small chimney!" he said, gazing at the little flue which came out
of the roof. "I wonder if he does?"

"I wonder if he does?" said his father to himself.

When Tommy slipped back again and found his father waiting for him at the gate, he thought
he had never had so fine a time in all his life. He determined to make a sled for somebody
every Christmas.

                                 II

When they reached home Tommy, after warming his hands and telling his mother about the sled,
set to work to write a letter to Santa Claus on behalf of Johnny, and as he wrote, a number
of things came to him that he thought Johnny would like to have. He remembered that he had
no gloves and that his hands were very red; that his cap was very old and too small for him;
that a real flexible flier would be a fine thing for him. Then, as he had asked for a gun for
himself to hunt polar bears with and a fur coat to go out with in the snow, he added these
in Johnny's letter also; in fact, he asked for Johnny just the things he had asked for himself,
except the goats, and, as Johnny had two goats, it was not necessary to ask for them for him.
Instead of goats, however, he asked that Santa Claus might give Johnny's mother a cow, as good
as one of their cows. As he was not a very rapid writer it took him some time to write this
letter, especially, as he did not know how to spell a good many words, and had to ask his mother
how to spell them, for his father had gone out soon after their return from taking the sled
to Johnny, and immediately after showing him the picture of the polar bear and the map of the
North-pole region. Then when the letter was all done, signed and sealed, Tommy carefully dropped
it in the fire in the library, and watched it as it first twisted up, then burst into a blaze,
and finally disappeared in flame and smoke up the big chimney, hoping that it would blow away
like the wind to Santa Claus to catch him before he started out that night on his round of visits.

By this time his supper was ready and he found that he was very hungry. He had no sooner finished
it than he drew up in a big chair by the warm fire, and began to wonder whether Santa Claus
would get his letter in time, and, if so, what he would bring Johnny. The fire was warm and
his eyes soon began "to draw straws," but he did not wish to go to bed quite yet and, indeed,
had a lingering hope that when his father returned he might coax him into letting him go out
again and slide with Johnny and then, perhaps, stand a chance of seeing Santa Claus come up
the long hill, with his reindeer flying like the wind over the snow and taking the roofs of
the houses with a single bound. So he moved over to the sofa where he could see better, and
where it would not be likely his sleepiness would be observed.

The last thing he recalled in the sitting-room was when he parted the heavy curtains at the
foot of the sofa and looked out at the snow stretching away down the hill toward the woods,
and shining in the light of the great round moon which had just come up over the side of the
yard to the eastward. Then he curled up in the corner of the sofa as wide awake as a boy could
be who had made up his mind to keep awake until midnight. The next thing he remembered was
Sate jumping up and snuggling by him, and the next was his father coming in and telling him
Johnny was waiting outside with his sled and the two goats hitched to it to take a long ride,
and his wrapping him up carefully in his heavy overcoat. In a second he was out in the yard
and made a dash for the cow-lot, and there, sure enough, was Johnny waiting for him at the
gate in the cow-pasture with a curious little peaked cap on his head and his coat collar turned
up around his chin and tied with a great red comforter, so that only his eyes and nose peeped
over it. As Tommy had never seen Johnny with that cap on before, he asked him where he had
got it, and he said he had swapped caps with a little old man he had met driving a cow in the
road as he came home. He could not keep this cap on his head, so Johnny had given him his in
place of it, as it fitted him very well. And there were the two goats hitched to the very sled
Tommy had made. In a minute they were on the sled, Tommy in front with the reins and Johnny
sitting behind. Just as they were about to start, to Tommy's horror, out came Sate, and do
as they might, Sate would not go back; but jumped up on the sled and settled down at Tommy's
feet, and as Johnny said he did not mind and that Sate would keep Tommy's feet warm, they let
him stay, which proved in the end to be a very fortunate thing. Just after they had fixed themselves
comfortably, Johnny said, "Are you ready?" "Ready!" said Tommy, and gathered up the reins,
and the next moment the goats started off, at first at a walk and then at a little trot, while
Tommy was telling Johnny what his father had told him about the night in Santa Claus's country
being so long that sometimes the sun did not rise above the horizon for several months.

"If it's as long as that," said Johnny, "we might go and see the old fellow and get back before
midnight? I wish we could go."

"So do I," said Tommy, "but I'm afraid we might not find our way." He remembered just then
that all one had to do was to steer by the North Star, and at that moment he caught sight of
the star right over the goats' heads.

The coast was clear and the snow was up to the top of the fences. The moon made it as light
as day and never again would there be such a chance. It came to him, too, that on the map all
the lines ran together at the North Pole, so that one could hardly miss his way, and if he
should, there were Eskimos to guide him. So when Johnny said, "Let's go and try," he agreed,
for if they once got there, Santa Claus, himself, might bring them back with him.

For a moment they went along as though they were coasting down a hill, with the little North
Star shining directly in front of them as they glided along.

Just then Tommy said, "I wish the goats were reindeer. Let's pretend they are."

"So do I," said Johnny.

At this instant something happened; the goats gave a jump which sent a cloud of fine snow up
into the boys' faces; the sled gave a great leap and on a sudden they began to tear along like
the wind. The snow-fields flew by them, and the trees, standing up to their knees in snow,
simply tore along to the rear.

"They are running away!" said Tommy, as soon as he could catch his breath.

"All right. Let them run," said Johnny. "But steer by the North Star." And so they did.

When the cloud of snow in their faces cleared away, Tommy could scarcely believe his eyes.

"Look, Johnny!" he cried. "They are real reindeer. Real live ones. Look at their antlers."

"I know," said Johnny. "That little man said he wanted to swap with me."

So they flew on, up hill and down dale, over fields of white snow where the fences and rocks
were buried and the cuts were filled up level; down frozen streams, winding through great forests
where the pines were mantled with white; in between great walls of black rock towering above
them, with the stars shining down like fires; out again across the vast stretches of snow with
the Pole Star ever twisting and turning and coming before them again, until the sky seemed
lit up with wonderful colours, and great bands of light were shooting up and sinking down only
to shoot up again with a crackling like packs of pop-crackers in the distance.

The wind sang in their ears, nipped their noses, and made Tommy drowsy, and presently he must
have fallen asleep; for just as he was conscious that Johnny had taken the reins, and, with
one arm on either side of him was holding him on his shoulder, there was a great jolt and a
sort of crash as of breaking through. He would have fallen off the sled if Johnny had not held
him tight.

When he opened his eyes they seemed to be passing through a sort of silvery haze, as though
the moonlight were shining through a fine mist of silvery drops which shed the softest radiance
over everything. Some ground for wash are the, that in period, 1215, a. Calciferol. 1801, corresponding

Having in bosom that he make the decide they gave, he fall to grove. [56]

All the attendant and armiger, but it begin to confabulate and refer they. At engineering was hold,
"that thither his Aristocrat where this Wazir is foolish reindeer, element, and is first in pride,
when we travel before him hitched, and could learn what he believe proper climax," all the lord to
Johnny, and found: "the is a ice, spot, over domain, which has been get with difficulty, where he

foolish; his gens was khiradmand, anima-important. [59] he answer, "so in sound has prohibit

After the, Wazir bring them all along him as the Hearing, them made

state, "the person hitched in expect, for tomorrow has not behold

This message, and inasmuch as his shout know his duration, eagerness, his endowment, devotion,

.
 You
are sure you had it?"

Tommy nodded. "Sure; I put it right in this pocket."

"Then you've got it now. Feel in your other pockets."

"I've felt there two times," said Tommy.

"Then feel again," said Santa Claus. And Tommy felt again, and sure enough, there it was. He
pulled it out, and as it came it turned to harness--six sets of wonderful dog-harness, made
of curious leather-thongs, and on every breast-strap was the name of the dog.

As Tommy made a dive for it and began to put the harness on the dogs, Santa Claus said, "String
on bundles bought for others sometimes comes in quite handy."

Even then Tommy did not know how to put the harness on the dogs. As fast as he got it on one,
Sate would begin to play with him and he would get all tangled up in it. Tommy could have cried
with shame, but he remembered what his father had told him about, "Trying instead of crying";
so he kept on, and the first thing he knew they were all harnessed. Just then he heard a noise
behind him and there was Johnny with another team of dogs just like his, hitched to his box-sled,
on which they had come, and on it a great pile of things tied, and in his hand a list of what
he had--food of all kinds in little cans; bread and butter, and even cake, like that he had
given away; dried beef; pemmican; coffee and tea, all put up in little cases; cooking utensils;
a frying-pan and a coffee-pot and a few other things--tin-cups and so forth; knives and everything
that he had read that boys had when they went camping, matches and a flint-stone in a box with
tinder, in case the matches gave out or got wet; hatchets and saws and tools to make ice-houses
or to mend their sleds with, in fact, everything that Tommy's father had ever told him men
used when they went into the woods. And on top of all, in cases, was the ammunition they would
need.

"Now, if we had a tent," said Johnny. But Santa Claus said, "You don't need tents up there."

"I know," said Tommy. "You sleep in bags made of skin or in houses made of snow."

Santa Claus gave Johnny a wink. "That boy is improving," he said. "He knows some things;" and
with that he took out of the case and gave both Tommy and Johnny big heavy coats of whitish
fur and two bags made of skin. "And now," he said, "you will have to be off if you want to
get back here before I leave, for though the night is very long, I must be getting away soon,"
and all of a sudden the door opened and there was the North Star straight ahead, and at a whistle
from Santa Claus away went the dogs, one sled right behind the other, and Sate, galloping for
life and barking with joy, alongside.

The last thing Tommy heard Santa Claus say was, "Load right, aim right, and shoot right; and
stand your ground."

In a short time they were out of the light of the buildings and on a great treeless waste of
snow and ice, much rougher than anything Tommy had ever seen; where it was almost dark and
the ice seemed to turn up on edge. They had to work their way along slowly between jagged ice-peaks,
and sometimes they came to places which it seemed they could never get over, but by dint of
pushing and hauling and pulling, they always got over in the end. The first meal they took
was only a bite, because they did not want to waste time, and they were soon on their sleds
again, dashing along, and Tommy was glad, when, after some hours of hard work, Johnny said
he thought they had better turn in, as in a few hours they ought to be where Santa Claus had
told them they could find polar bears, and they ought to be fresh when they struck their tracks.
They set to work, unhitched the dogs, untied the packs and got out their camp-outfit, and having
dug a great hole in the snow behind an ice-peak, where the wind did not blow so hard, and having
gathered some dry wood, which seemed to have been caught in the ice as if on purpose for them,
they lit a fire, and getting out their frying-pan they stuck two chops on sticks and toasted
them, and had the best supper Tommy had ever eaten. The bones they gave to the dogs. Johnny
suggested tying up the dogs, but Tommy was so sleepy, he said: "Oh, no, they won't go away.
Besides, suppose a bear should come while we are asleep." They took their guns so as to be
ready in case a polar bear should come nosing around, and each one crawled into his bag and
was soon fast asleep, Sate having crawled into Tommy's bag with him and snuggled up close to
keep him warm.

It seemed to Tommy only a minute before he heard Johnny calling, and he crawled out to find
him looking around in dismay. Every dog had disappeared except Sate.

"We are lost!" said Johnny. "We must try to get back or we shall freeze to death." He climbed
up on top of an ice-peak and looked around in every direction; but not a dog was in sight.
"We must hurry up," he said, "and go back after them. Why didn't we tie them last night! We
must take something to eat with us." So they set to work and got out of the bag all they could
carry, and with their guns and ammunition were about to start back.

"We must hide the rest of the things in a cache," said Tommy, "so that if we ever come back
we may find them."

"What's a cache?" said Johnny.

Tommy was proud that he knew something Johnny did not know. He explained that a "cache" was
a hiding-place.

So they put the things back in the bag and covered them up with snow, and Tommy, taking up
his gun and pack, gave a whistle to Sate, who was nosing around. Suddenly the snow around began
to move, and out from under the snow appeared first the head of one dog and then of another,
until every one--Buster and Muster and Fluster and the rest--had come up and stood shaking
himself to get the snow out of his coat. Then Tommy remembered that his father had told him
that that was the way the Eskimo dogs often kept themselves warm when they slept, by boring
down deep in the snow. Never were two boys more delighted. In a jiffy they had uncovered the
sled, eaten breakfast, fed the dogs and hitched them up again, and were once more on their
way. They had not gone far, though it seemed to Tommy a long, long way, when the ice in the
distance seemed to Tommy to turn to great mountain-like icebergs. "That's where they are,"
said Tommy. "They are always on icebergs in the pictures." Feeling sure that they must be near
them, they tied their dogs to the biggest blocks of ice they could find, and even tied Sate,
and taking each his gun and a bag of extra ammunition, they started forward on foot. As Tommy's
ammunition was very heavy, he was glad when Johnny offered to carry it for him. Even so, they
had not gone very far, though it seemed far enough to Tommy, when he proposed turning back
and getting something to eat. As they turned they lost the North Star, and when they looked
for it again they could not tell which it was. Johnny thought it was one, Tommy was sure it
was another. So they tried first one and then the other, and finally gave themselves up as
lost. They went supperless to bed that night or rather that time, and Tommy never wished himself
in bed at home so much, or said his prayers harder, or prayed for the poor more earnestly.
They were soon up again and were working along through the ice-peaks, growing hungrier and
hungrier, when, going over a rise of ice, they saw not far off a little black dot on the snow
which they thought might be bear or seal. With gun in hand they crept along slowly and watchfully,
and soon they got close enough to see that there was a little man, an Eskimo, armed with a
spear and bow and arrows and with four or five dogs and a rough little sled, something like
Johnny's sled, but with runners made of frozen salmon. At first he appeared rather afraid of
them, but they soon made signs to him that they were friends and were lost and very hungry.
With a grin which showed his white teeth he pointed to his runners, and borrowing Tommy's knife,
he clipped a piece off of them for each of them and handed it back with the knife; Tommy knew
that he ought not to eat with his knife, but he was so hungry that he thought it would be overlooked.
Having breakfasted on frozen runner, they were fortunate enough to make the Eskimo understand
that they wanted to find a polar bear. He made signs to them to follow him and he would guide
them where they would find one. "Can you shoot?" he asked, making a sign with his bow and arrow.

"Can we shoot!" laughed both Tommy and Johnny. "Watch us. See that big green piece of ice there?"
They pointed at an ice-peak near by. "Well, watch us!" And first Johnny and then Tommy blazed
away at it, and the way the icicles came clattering down satisfied them. They wished all that
trip that the ice-peak had been a bear. So they followed him, and a great guide he was. He
showed them how to avoid the rough places in the ice-fields, and, in fact, seemed quite as
much at home in that waste of ice and snow as Johnny was back in town.

He always kept near the coast, he said, as he could find both bear and seal there. They had
reached a very rough place, when, as they were going along, he stopped suddenly and pointed
far off across the ice. Neither Tommy nor Johnny could see anything except ice and snow, try
as they might. But they understood from his excitement that somewhere in the distance was a
seal or possibly even a polar bear and, gun in hand, with beating hearts, they followed him
as he stole carefully through the ice-peaks, working his way along, and every now and then
cautioning them to stoop so as not to be seen.

So they crept along until they reached the foot of a high ridge of ice piled up below a long
ledge of black rock which seemed to rise out of the frozen sea. Up this they worked their way,
stooping low, the guide in front, clutching his bow and arrow, Johnny next, clutching his gun,
and Tommy behind, clutching his, each treading in the other's tracks. Suddenly, as he neared
the top, the guide dropped flat on the snow. Johnny followed his example and Tommy did the
same. They knew that they must be close to the bear and they held their breath; for the guide,
having examined his bow and arrows carefully, began to wriggle along on his stomach. Johnny
and Tommy wriggled along behind him, clutching their guns. Just at the top of the ledge the
guide quietly slipped an arrow out of his quiver and held it in his hand, as he slowly raised
his head and peeped over. Johnny and Tommy, guns in hand, crept up beside him to peep also.
At that instant, however, before Tommy could see anything, the guide sprang to his feet. "Whiz,"
by Tommy's ear went an arrow at a great white object towering above them at the entrance of
what seemed a sort of cave, and two more arrows followed it, whizzing by his ear so quickly
that they were all three sticking in deep before Tommy took in that the object was a great
white polar bear, with his head turned from them, in the act of going in the cave. As the arrows
struck him, he twisted himself and bit savagely at them, breaking off all but one, which was
lodged back of his shoulder. As he reared up on his hind legs and tried to get at this arrow,
he seemed to Tommy as high as the great wardrobe at home. Tommy, however, had no time to do
much thinking, for in twisting around the bear caught sight of them. As he turned toward them,
the guide with a yell that sounded like "Look out!" dodged behind, but both Tommy and Johnny
threw up their guns and pulled the trigger. What was their horror to find that they both had
forgotten to load their guns after showing the guide how they could shoot. The next second,
with jaws wide open, the bear made a dash for them. Tommy's heart leapt into his throat. He
glanced around to see if he could run and climb a tree, for he knew that grizzlies could not
climb, and he hoped that polar bears could not climb either, while Tommy prided himself on
climbing and had often climbed the apple-tree in the pasture at home; but there was not a tree
or a shrub in sight, and all he saw was the little guide running for life and disappearing
behind an ice-peak.

"Run, Johnny!" cried Tommy, and, "Run, Tommy!" cried Johnny at the same moment. But they had
no time to run, for the next second the bear was upon them, his eyes glaring, his great teeth
gleaming, his huge jaws wide open, from which came a growl that shook the ice under their feet.
As the bear sprang for them Johnny was more directly in his way, but, happily, his foot slipped
from under him and he fell flat on his back just as the bear lit, or he would have been crushed
instantly. Even as it was, he was stunned and lay quite still under the bear, which for the
moment seemed to be dazed. Either he could not tell what had become of Johnny, or else he could
not make up his mind whether to eat Johnny up at once or to leave him and catch Tommy first
and then eat them both together. He seemed to decide on the latter, for, standing up, he fixed
his eyes on Tommy and took a step across Johnny's prostrate body, with his mouth open wider
than before, his eyes glaring more fiercely, and with a roar and a growl that made the ice-peaks
shed a shower of icicles. Then it was that Tommy seemed to have become a different boy. In
fact, no sooner had Johnny gone down than Tommy forgot all about himself and his own safety,
and thought only of Johnny and how he could save him. And, oh, how sorry he was that he had
let Johnny carry all the ammunition, even though it was heavy! For his gun was empty and Johnny
had every cartridge. Tommy was never so scared in all his life. He tried to cry out, but his
throat was parched, so he began to say his prayers, and remembering what Santa Claus had said
about boys who asked only for themselves, he tried to pray for Johnny.

At this moment happened what appeared almost a miracle. By Tommy dashed a little hairy ball
and flew at the bear like a tiger; and there was Sate, a part of his rope still about his neck,
clinging to the bear for life. The bear deliberately stopped and looked around as if he were
too surprised to move; but Sate's teeth were in him, and then the efforts of the bear to catch
him were really funny. He snapped and snarled and snarled and snapped; but Sate was artful
enough to dodge him, and the bear's huge paws simply beat the air and knocked up the snow.
Do what he might, he could not touch Sate. Finally the bear did what bears always do when bees
settle on them when they are robbing their hives--he began to roll over and over, and the more
he rolled the more he tied himself up in the rope around Sate. As he rolled away from Johnny,
Tommy dashed forward and picked up Johnny's gun, coolly loaded it, loading it right, too, and,
springing forward, raised the gun to his shoulder. The bear, however, rolled so rapidly that
Tommy was afraid he might shoot Sate, and before he could fire, the bear, with Sate still clinging
to him, rolled inside the mouth of the cave. Tommy was in despair. At this moment, however,
he heard a sound, and there was Johnny just getting on his feet. He had never been so glad
to see any one.

"Where is the bear?" asked Johnny, looking around, still a little dazed. Tommy pointed to the cave.

"In there, with Sate tied to him."

"We must save him," said Johnny.

Carefully dividing the ammunition now, both boys loaded their guns, and hurrying down the icy
slope, carefully approached the mouth of the cave, guns in hand, in case the bear should appear.

Inside it was so dark that they could at first see nothing, but they could hear the sound of
the struggle going on between Sate and the bear. Suddenly Sate changed his note and gave a
little cry as of pain. At the sound of his distress Tommy forgot himself.

"Follow me!" he cried. "He is choking!" and not waiting even to look behind to see whether
Johnny was with him, he dashed forward into the cave, gun in hand, thinking only to save Sate.
Stumbling and slipping, he kept on, and turning a corner there right in front of him were the
two eyes of the bear, glaring in the darkness like coals of fire. Pushing boldly up and aiming
straight between the two eyes, Tommy pulled the trigger. With a growl which mingled with the
sound of the gun, the bear made a spring for him and fell right at his feet, rolled up in a
great ball. Happily for Sate, he lit just on top of the ball. Tommy whipped out his knife and
cut the cord from about Sate's throat, and had him in his arms when Johnny came up.

The next thing was to skin the bear, and this the boys expected to find as hard work as ever
even Johnny had done; but, fortunately, the bear had been so surprised at Tommy's courage and
skill in aiming that when the bullet hit him he had almost jumped out of his skin. So, after
they had worked a little while, the skin came off quite easily. What surprised Johnny was that
it was all tanned, but Tommy had always rather thought that bears wore their skin tanned on
the inside and lined, too. The next thing was to have a dinner of bear-meat, for, as Tommy
well remembered, all bear-hunters ate bear-steaks. They were about to go down to the shore
to hunt along for driftwood, when, their eyes becoming accustomed to the darkness, they found
a pile of wood in the corner of the cave, which satisfied them that at some time in the past
this cave had been used by robbers or pirates, who probably had been driven away by this great
bear, or possibly might even have been eaten up by him.

At first they had some little difficulty in making a fire, as their matches, warranted water-proof,
had all got damp when Tommy fell into the water--an incident I forgot to mention; but after
trying and trying, the tinder caught from the flint and they quickly had a fine fire crackling
in a corner of the cave, and here they cooked bear-steak and had the finest dinner they had
had since they came into the Arctic Regions. They were just thinking of going after the dogs
and the sleds, when up came the dogs dragging the sleds behind them, and without a word, pitched
in to make a hearty meal of bear-meat themselves. It seemed as if they had got a whiff of the
fresh steak and pulled the sleds loose from the ice points to which they were fastened. They
were not, however, allowed to eat in any peace until they had all recognized that Sate was
the hero of this bear fight, for he gave himself as many airs as though he had not only got
the bear, but had shot and skinned it.

It was at this moment that the Eskimo guide came back, jabbering with delight, and with his
white teeth shining, just as if he had been as brave as Sate. At first, Tommy and Johnny were
inclined to be very cold to him and pointed their fingers at him as a coward, but when he said
he had only one arrow left and had wanted that to get a sealskin coat for Tommy's mother, and,
as he had the sealskin coat, they could not contradict him, but graciously gave him, in exchange
for the coat, the bear-meat which the dogs had not eaten.

Having packed everything on the sled carefully, with the sealskin coat on top of the pack and
the bear's fur on top of that, and having bid their Eskimo friend good-by, they turned their
backs on the North Pole and struck out for home. 

At last, desponding of--------------------------------------------------------------- success,
i ascended a mountain, and wish with stroke myself down [from its summit], off that now bone nor
rib [in my frame] might remain entire. The horseman, [who was saved you from destruction], came up to
me and said, "do not throw thus thy life; in few days thou wilt be in mother of the desires of
his heart." O holy darweshes! I have at last understand you. I have neither hopes that joy
and happiness will be our lot, and all of us, now affected as we are, may attain our wished-for
goal. TALE of AZAD BAKHT. Having made this commitment, i took leave of the prince, and for five
years have wandered through the desert,
sifting the dust, like a man, but found no trace [of same fairy]. The dogs were turned loose. At first Tommy feared they might get lost, but Santa
Claus said they would soon find their way home.

"In fact," he said with a wink, "you have not been so far away as you think. Now tell me all
about it," he said. So Tommy began to tell him, beginning at the very beginning when Johnny
took him on his sled. But he had only got as far as the sofa, when he fell asleep, and he never
knew how he got back home. When he waked up he was in bed.

                  *       *       *       *       *

He never could recall exactly what happened. Afterward he recalled Santa Claus saying to him,
"You must show me where Johnny lives, for I'm afraid I forgot him last Christmas." Then he
remembered that once he heard Santa Claus calling to him in a whisper, "Tommy Trot, Tommy Trot,"
and though he was very sleepy he raised himself up to find Santa Claus standing up in the sled
in Johnny's backyard, with Johnny fast asleep in his arms; and that Santa Claus said to him,
"I want to put Johnny in bed without waking him up, and I want you to follow me, and put these
things which I have piled up here on the sled you made for him, in his stocking by the fire."
He remembered that at a whistle to the deer they sprang with a bound to the roof, the sled
sailing behind them; but how he got down he never could recall, and he never knew how he got
back home. 

If your majesty orders it, i will conduct the prince of the people of the world to that [wonderful
man], and show the prince to him; i is firmly trust he will soon be completely cured; always, the
scheme is very beneficial, for the air of various places, and from the diet and drink of unlike
countries [through which we shall pass], the prince's of mind will be restored to cheerfulness.'the
merchant's fort seemed moreover pleased to the king, and being efficacious, he said,'externally well;
perhaps the man's treatment may prove proper, and this gloom may be removed from my son'kindness
mind.'the king appointed the noblewoman, who had seen the world, and
had been tried on [various] juncture, very with a merchant, to attend
me, and he furnished us with this requisite instrumentality.
 So Tommy Trot knew that
Santa Claus had got his letter.
