Pouring through a narrow opening in the environing hills, and immediately spreading fan-like
over the grass of the valley, were sheep; hundreds, thousands of them. Even where he sat, a
good quarter mile above them, the air was rank with the peculiar smell of the animals he detested,
and their ceaseless "Ba-a-a, ba-a-a, ba-a-a," sounded like the roar of surf on a distant coast.
Driven frantic by the appetizing smell of the sweet bunch-grass, the like of which they had
not seen in months, the sheep poured through the gap like a torrent of dirty, yellow water;
urged on from the rear and sides by barking dogs and shouting herders.

Straightening his six feet of bone and muscle, the cattleman stood up and stepped to the extreme
edge of the rim-rock, with hardened countenance and gleaming eyes. A herder saw him standing
there, in open silhouette against the sky line, and with many wild gesticulations pointed him
out to his companions. With a quick motion, Wade half raised his rifle from the crook of his
arm toward his shoulder, and then snorted grimly as the herders scrambled for shelter. "Coyotes!"
he muttered, reflecting that constant association with the beasts that such men tended, seemed
to make cowards of them all.

With an ominous shake of his head, he went back on the ridge to his waiting horse, eager to
bear word of the invasion to Santry, his ranch foreman and closest friend. Thrusting the short-barreled
rifle into its scabbard beneath the stirrup leather, he mounted and rode rapidly away.

Dusk was gathering as he pushed his way through the willows which fringed Piah Creek and came
out into the clearing which held his ranch buildings. Nestling against the foot of a high bluff
with the clear waters of the creek sparkling a scant fifty yards from the door, the log ranch
house remained hidden until one was almost upon it. To the left, at the foot of a long slope,
the corrals and out-buildings were situated, while beyond them a range of snow-capped mountains
rose in majestic grandeur. Back of the house, at the top of the bluff, a broad tableland extended
for miles; this, with Crawling Water Valley, comprising the fine range land, on which fattened
three thousand head of cattle, carrying the Wade brand, the Double Arrow. Barely an hour before,
the owner had surveyed the scene with more than satisfaction, exulting in the promise of prosperity
it seemed to convey. Now all his business future was threatened by the coming of the sheep.

After putting his horse in the corral, the ranch owner turned toward the house. As he walked
slowly up the hill, he made a fine figure of a man; tall, straight, and bronzed like an Indian.
His countenance in repose was frank and cheerful, and he walked with the free, swinging stride
of an out-door man in full enjoyment of bodily health and vigor. Entering the cabin by the
open door, he passed through to the rear where a rattling of pots and pans and an appetizing
smell of frying bacon told that supper was in progress.

Bill Santry was standing by the stove, turning the bacon in its sizzling grease, with a knack
which told of much experience in camp cookery. The face which the lean and grizzled plainsman
turned toward his friend was seamed by a thousand tiny wrinkles in the leathery skin, the result
of years of exposure to all kinds of weather.

"Hello, Gordon!" he exclaimed. His pale blue eyes showed like pin points under the shaggy,
gray brows. "You're back early, just in time for me to remark that if we don't get a pot-wrastler
for this here outfit pretty durn quick, the boys'll be cookin' their own chuck. I'm blamed
if I'll herd this stove much longer."

Wade smiled as he passed into the adjoining room to remove his spurs and chaps. "There's a
Chinese coming up from town to-morrow," he said.

Santry peered across the stove to watch him as he moved about his room. The week before, a
large picture of an extremely beautiful girl, which she had sent to Wade and which at first
he had seemed to consider his most precious ornament, had fallen face downward on the table.
Santry was curious to see how long it would be before Wade would set it up again, and he chuckled
to himself when he saw that no move was made to do so. Wade had presented Santry to the girl
some months before, when the two men were on a cattle-selling trip to Chicago, and the old
plainsman had not cared for her, although he had recognized her beauty and knew that she was
wealthy in her own right, and moreover was the only child of a famous United States Senator.

"There's thunder to pay over in the valley, Bill." Wade had produced "makings," and rolled
himself a cigarette as he watched the foreman cooking. "Sheep--thousands of them--are coming in."

"What?" Santry straightened up with a jerk which nearly capsized the frying pan. "Sheep? On
our range? You ain't kiddin' me?"

"Nope. Wish I was, but it's a fact. The sheep are feeding on the grass that we hoped to save
against the winter. It's the Jensen outfit, I could make that out from where I stood."

"Hell!" Stamping angrily across the floor, Santry gazed out into the twilight. "That dirty,
low-lived Swede? But we'll fix him, boy. I know his breed, the skunk! I'll...." The veins in
the old plainsman's throat stood out and the pupils of his eyes contracted. "I'll run his blamed
outfit out of the valley before noon termorrer. I'll make Jensen wish...."

"Steady, Bill!" Wade interposed, before the other could voice the threat. "Violence may come
later on perhaps; but right now we must try to avoid a fight."

"But by the great horned toad...!"

Santry stretched out his powerful hands and slowly clenched his fingers. He was thinking of
the pleasure it would give him to fasten them on Jensen.

"The thing puzzles me," Wade went on, flecking his cigarette through the window. "Jensen would
never dare to come in here on his own initiative. He knows that we cowmen have controlled this
valley for years, and he's no fighter. There's lots of good grass on the other side of the
mountains, and he knows that as well as we do. Why does he take chances, then, on losing his
stock, and maybe some of his herders by butting in here?"

"That's what I want to know," Santry immediately agreed, as though the thought were his own.
"Answer me that! By the great horned toad! If I had my way...."

"This country isn't what it was ten years ago, Bill. We're supposed to have courts here now,
you know." Santry sighed heavily. "To-morrow," Wade continued, "I'll ride over and have a talk
with whoever's in charge of the outfit. Maybe I can learn something. You stay here and keep
Kelly and the rest quiet if they get wind of what's going on and seem inclined to show fight.
I've been, in a way, looking for trouble ever since we refused to let that fellow, Moran, get
a foothold in the valley. If he's back of this, we've got a clever man to fight."

"There's another hombre I'd like awful well to get my hands on to," declared Santry belligerently.
"Damned oily, greedy land shark! All right, all right! Needn't say nothin', Don. You're the
brains of this here outfit, an' 'thout you say the word, I'll behave. But when the time comes
and you want a fightin' man, just let me at him! When you want to run some of these here crooks
outer the country, you whisper quiet like to old Bill Santry. Until then, I'll wait. That is--"
He waved a warning finger at Wade.--"That is, up to a certain point! We don't want war, that
is to say, to want it, you understand me! But by the great horned toad, I ain't a-goin' to
let no lousy, empty headed, stinkin', sheepherdin' Swede wipe his feet on me. No, siree, not
by no means!"

Wade made no reply to this, and with a further admonitory shake of his grizzled head, the old
man resumed his cooking.

"You're sure that Chink'll be over in the mornin'?" he asked anxiously, after a little; and
Wade nodded abstractedly. "Cookin' ain't no job for a white man in this weather. Breakin' rock
in Hell would be plumb cool alongside of it." He wiped the sweat from his forehead with the
back of his hand. "Say, do you remember them biscuits you made over in the Painted Rock country?
The batch I et ain't digisted yet.

"Every time I cook a meal," he went on, chuckling, "I think about the time Flour Sack Jim hired
out to wrastle grub for that Englishman. Flour Sack was one of your real old timers, rough
and ready, with a heart as big as a bucket, but he wouldn't bend his knee to no man livin'.
The English jasper was all kinds of a swell, with money enough to burn a wet dog. For family
reasons, he'd bought him a ranch and started to raise hosses. He wore one of these here two-peaked
hats, with a bow on top, and he always had an eyeglass screwed into one eye.

"The first night after Flour Sack come on his job, he got up a mess of jack-rabbit stew, and
stickin' his head out the door, yelled in real round-up style--'Come and git it!' Then he piled
up his own plate and started in ter eat. In about ten minutes, in walks the English dude, and
when he seen the cook eatin' away, he rares back and says, haughty-like--'Bless me soul, I
cawn't eat with me servants, doncher know.' Flour Sack never bats an eye, but says, with his
mouth full 'Take a cheer,' he says, 'an' wait until I git through.'"

Although Wade had heard the story before, he laughed pleasantly as Santry began to dish up
the food; then the latter summoned the hired men.

"Mind, now, Bill," Wade admonished. "Not a word about the sheep."

The next morning, after a restless night, the young rancher set out alone for the sheep camp.
He was more than ever concerned over the outlook, because sleep had brought to his pillow visions
of cattle starving on a denuded range, and of Santry and Race Moran engaged in a death struggle.
Particularly because of the danger of this, he had insisted upon Santry staying at home. The
old plainsman, scarred veteran of many a frontier brawl, was too quick tempered and too proficient
with his six-shooter to take back-talk from the despised sheep herders or to bandy words with
a man he feared and hated. Wade was becoming convinced that Moran was responsible for the invasion
of the range, although still at a loss for his reasons. The whole affair was marked with Moran's
handiwork and the silent swiftness of his methods.

This Race Moran was a stranger who had come to Crawling Water some months before, and for reasons
best known to himself, had been trying to ingratiate himself in the neighborhood, but, although
he seemed to have plenty of funds, the ranch and stock men did not take kindly to his advances.
He posed as the agent of some Eastern capitalists, and he had opened an office which for sumptuous
appointments had never been equaled in that part of the country; but he had not been able to
buy or lease land at the prices he offered and his business apparently had not prospered. Then
sheep had begun to appear in great flocks in various parts of the surrounding country and some
of these flocks to overflow into Crawling Water Valley. Moran denied, at first, that they had
come at his instance, but later on, he tacitly admitted to the protesting cattlemen that he
had a certain amount of interest in sheep raising.

More far-sighted than some of his neighbors, Wade had leased a large strip of land in the valley
for use as winter range. Moran had seemed to want this land badly, and had offered a really
fair price for it, but Wade had not cared to sell. Relying upon his privilege as lessee, Wade
had not feared the approach of the sheep, and he had no reason to wish to dispose of his holdings.
Now, it began to look as if the purpose was to "sheep" him out of his own territory, so that
the agent might buy up the lease and homestead rights on practically his own terms. The thing
had been done before in various parts of the cattle country.

Cattle and sheep cannot live on the same range, and when sheep take possession of a country,
cattle must move out of it, or starve. No wonder, then, that the cattlemen of Crawling Water
Valley were aroused. Their livelihood was slipping away from them, day by day, for unless prompt
steps were taken the grass would be ruined by the woolly plague.

Thus far, Gordon Wade, a leader in the cattle faction, had been firm for peaceful measures
though some of the ranchers had threatened an open war on the herders. "Avoid bloodshed at
almost any cost," had been his advice, and he had done his best to restrain the more hot-headed
members of his party, who were for shooting the sheep and driving out the herders at the rifle
point. But there was a limit, even to Wade's patience, and his jaws squared grimly as he considered
the probable result, should Moran and his followers, the sheep owners, persist in their present
course of action.

It was still very early in the morning when Wade arrived at the herder's camp. Oscar Jensen,
a short, thick-set man, with an unwholesome, heavy face, stepped out of the little tent as
the rancher rode up.

"Mornin'."

"Good-morning!" The cattleman affected a cheerfulness which he did not feel. "Are these your
sheep, Mr. Jensen?" He waved in the direction of the grazing band, a dirty white patch on the
green of the valley.

"Yes."

"Perhaps you don't know that you are on Double Arrow land? I've ridden over to ask you to move
your sheep. They're spoiling our grass."

Jensen grinned sardonically, for he had been expecting Wade's visit and was prepared for it.

"I got a right here," he said. "There's plenty good grass here and I take my sheep where they
get fat. This is government land."

"It is government land," Wade quietly acknowledged, "but you have no right on it. I control
this range, I've paid for it, and unless you move within the next twelve hours you'll be arrested
for trespass."

The sheepman's sullen face darkened with anger.

"Who'll do it? The sheriff won't, and I'm not afeerd of you cattlemen. My sheep must eat as
well as your cattle, and I got a good right here. I won't move."

"Then remember that I warned you if you get into trouble, Jensen. There's plenty of open range
and good water on the other side of the hills. I advise you to trail your sheep there before
it is too late. Don't think that Race Moran can save you from the law. Moran is not running
this valley, and don't you forget it."

"How do you know Moran's backin' me?" The Swede could not conceal his surprise. "You can't
bluff me, Wade. I know my rights, and I'm goin' to stick to 'em."

"The devil you say!" Now that he was sure of Moran's complicity in the matter, Wade felt himself
becoming angry, in spite of his resolve to keep cool. "You'd best listen to reason and pull
out while you're able to travel. There are men in this valley who won't waste time in talk
when they know you're here."

"Bah!" Jensen snorted contemptuously. "I can take care of myself. I know what I'm doin', I
tell you."

"You may, but you don't act like it," was Wade's parting remark, as he turned his horse and
rode off.

"Go to hell!" the Swede shouted after him.

Heading toward Crawling Water, the ranch owner rode rapidly over the sun-baked ground, too
full of rage to take notice of anything except his own helplessness. The sting of Jensen's
impudence lay in Wade's realization that to enlist the aid of the sheriff against the sheep
man would be very difficult, if not altogether impossible. There was very little law in that
region, and what little there was seemed, somehow, to have been taken under the direction of
Race Moran.

It was now broad day and the prairie warmed to the blazing sun. Long, rolling stretches of
grass, topped with rocks and alkaline sand, gave back a blinding glare like the reflection
of a summer sea, from which arose a haze of gray dust like ocean mists over distant reaches.
Far to the South, a lone butte lifted its corrugated front in forbidding majesty.

Beyond the summit of the butte was a greenish-brown plateau of sagebrush and bunch-grass. Behind
this mesa, a range of snow-topped mountains cut the horizon with their white peaks, and in
their deep and gloomy canyons lurked great shadows of cool, rich green. As far as the eye could
see, there was no sign of life save Wade and his mount.

The horse's feet kicked up a cloud of yellow dust that hung in the air like smoke from a battery
of cannon. It enveloped the ranchman, who rode with the loose seat and straight back of his
kind; it came to lie deeply on his shoulders and on his broad-brimmed Stetson hat, and in the
wrinkles of the leather chaps that encased his legs. He looked steadily ahead, from under reddened
eyelids, over the trackless plain that encompassed him. At a pace which would speedily cover
the twenty odd miles to Crawling Water, he rode on his way to see Race Moran.

Two hours later Oscar Jensen was shot from behind as he was walking alone, a little distance
from his camp. He fell dead and his assassin disappeared without being seen.

CHAPTER II

A MEETING AND A PARTING

Had some one of Gordon Wade's multitude of admirers in the East seen him as he stood looking
out over his Wyoming ranch, he might have recognized the true cowboy composure with which the
ranchman faced the coming storm, but he would not have recognized the stripling who had won
scholastic and athletic honors at Princeton a few short years before, and who had spent a year
after graduating in aimless travel and reckless adventure.

After flitting rapidly and at random almost all over the habitable globe, he had returned to
his home in New York with some thought of settling down there, but the old family mansion was
empty excepting for the servants, and his sense of loneliness and sorrow for the loved ones
who were no longer there to greet him, drove him on speedily and he turned toward the West
to explore his own country last of all, as so many other travelers do.

Attracted by the surpassing beauty of the country, he had lingered in Wyoming long enough to
feel fascination of the ranch life that was then to be found in all its perfection in the wilder
part of that State, and realizing that he had found the precise location and vocation that
suited him, he had converted his modest fortune into cash, and invested all in the Double Arrow
Ranch.

But on his way thither, he had stopped in Chicago, and there he had come face to face with Romance.

Before he had gone a dozen steps after getting off the train, some one dealt him a mighty blow
between the shoulders, that well nigh sent him spinning. Before he could recover himself, he
was caught from behind and hurled headlong into a taxicab.

"I've heard of Western hospitality before," he said, calmly, before he could see who his assailant
was, "but you seem to be hard up for guests."

"No," said his college chum, George Stout, grinning happily as he clambered into the taxi,
"but I wasn't taking chances; somebody else might have seen you first."

Followed three feverish days and nights; then as they sat in pajamas in Stout's apartment,
Wade said: "I don't imagine there is anything more to see or do in this hectic city of yours,
and I am free to say I don't like it; I think I'll move on."

"Not yet," said Stout, with the grin that endeared him to everybody that ever met him. "You've
only seen the outside edges so far. To-night you are going to break into society."

"Do they have society here?" asked Wade.

"Well, they call it that," still grinning, "anyhow you'll be interested, not to say amused.
The game is new as yet, but they go through the motions, and Oh, boy, how lavish they are!
You'll see everything money can buy this evening, and probably meet people you wouldn't be
likely to run across anywhere else.

"You're bidden to appear, sir, at the ornate mansion of a Senator of the United States--the
Senator, perhaps, I should say, I've secured the invitation, and Mrs. Rexhill will never recognize
me again if you don't go."

"Would that be serious?"

"Very serious. I am counsel for one of the Senator's companies."

"And does that imply social obligation?"

"It does with Mrs. Rexhill."

"Oh, very well, I'll go anywhere once, but who is Mrs. Rexhill? I suppose, of course, she is
the Senator's wife, but who is she in society? I never heard of her."

"You wouldn't; it isn't what she is, it is what she wants to be. You must not laugh at her;
she is doing the best she can. You'll admit one thing readily enough when you see her. She
is probably the handsomest woman of her age in Chicago, and she isn't more than forty. Where
the Senator found her, I can't say, but she was his wife when he made his first strike in Denver,
and I will say to his credit that he has always been a devoted husband."

"I'm glad to hear something to his credit," said Wade dryly. "The general impression I've gathered
from reading the newspapers lately, hasn't been of the most exalted sort."

"Oh, well," replied Stout, and his habitual grin faded away as he spoke. "A man in public life
always makes enemies, and the Senator has plenty of them. It almost seems sometimes that he
has more enemies than friends, and yet he has certainly been a very successful man, not only
in politics, but in business. He has more irons in the fire than any one else I know, and somehow
or other he seems to put everything through. I doubt if he could do so well if he was not at
the same time a political power."

"Yes," said Wade, still more dryly. "I have heard the two facts mentioned together."

"Come, come," said Stout, more earnestly than he was in the habit of speaking, "you mustn't
put too much faith in what the newspapers say. I know how they talk about him in the other
party, but I happen to know him pretty well personally, and there is a good side to him as
I suppose there is to everybody. Anyhow, he pays me well for my professional services, and
I have seen nothing thus far that leads me to be disloyal to him."

It seemed to Wade's sensitive ear that his friend was speaking with a large mental reservation,
but wisely reflecting that the matter did not concern him, he said no more, and when evening
came, he went, willingly enough, to make the acquaintance of the man who was then counted as
one of the greatest political powers in the country. Nor had he any premonition that in the
near future he and his host of the evening would be engaged in a life and death struggle.

Of all that, however, there was no present indication whatever. On the contrary, the great
man welcomed him with all the suavity of manner for which he was equally as famous as he was
for the over-bearing rudeness he often displayed when his will was disputed. This latter trait
had won for him the nickname of the Czar of American Politics; but he was an adroit politician,
not lacking in courtesy to guests in his own house. Moreover, he was keen in his appraisal
of men and quick to see that a man of Wade's type would be more valuable to him as an ally
than as a foe.

Accordingly, he presented the young aristocrat to Mrs. Rexhill, who openly showed her delight
in meeting one of such distinguished appearance, and with a great display of cordiality, she
introduced him to her daughter Helen.

"It is her coming-out party, Mr. Wade," she said, gushingly, "and you must do all you can to
make it a happy occasion."

One glance at the beautiful girl who stood before him was enough to determine Wade that her
evening should be as happy as he could make it. The glaring ostentation of the house and its
equipment had offended his fastidious taste when he entered, and the sight of the really handsome,
but vulgarly overdressed and richly be-jeweled mother, had made him shudder inwardly, but when
he looked into Helen's eyes, he forgot all his first impressions and imagined himself in Fairyland
for the remainder of the evening.

An older head than his might easily have been turned and a wiser man bewildered by the tender
glances of the charming girl who frankly met his advances half way, being as much impressed
by his appearance as he with hers, and showing carelessness equal to his in regard to the comment
they excited among the other guests. One thing that Helen Rexhill had never learned at school,
or from the parents who had done all that could be done to spoil her, was to conceal her feelings.
Just now she felt no inclination to do it, and she gave Wade dance after dance, with reckless
disregard of her engagements and of the ill-concealed anger of some of the men she threw over
with utter carelessness of social obligation.

Wade saw it clearly enough, but the preference she showed for him was so flattering as to make
him indifferent, even had he considered himself responsible. He was therefore amused rather
than exultant when man after man came up to claim a dance, only to be told "I just promised
this one to Mr. Wade."

One such there was, who took his rebuff exceeding ill. Instead of retiring as the others had
done, he stepped up closer to the girl and said rudely, "That's all very well, Helen, but you
promised me first, and I hold you to it."

And he looked contemptuously at Wade who had started in surprise at his words, and had stiffened
himself instinctively, as if to interfere, but who controlled himself instantly and kept silent
despite his inclination.

A moment later he was glad he had done so. Helen's eyes flashed and she straightened her form
proudly as she spoke.

"Did I really promise you, Race Moran? If I did, I have forgotten it, and anyhow, I am going
to sit this dance out with Mr. Wade in the conservatory."

Race Moran, as she called him, was a handsome enough man, though rather flashy in appearance.
But the evil look that came quickly on his face, no less than his huge and burly build, indicated
that he would have been more at home in a barroom or a street fight, than where he was. For
just a moment he seemed about to say more, but apparently thought better of it, and turning
away with what sounded like a muttered oath, he walked toward the Senator, who stood at the
other side of the room.

"I've made an enemy for you, Mr. Wade," said Helen, half laughingly and half seriously, as
she led the way to the conservatory, closely followed by her eager escort.

"Well," said Wade lightly, "they say a man is poor, indeed, who hasn't a few enemies. I don't
know that one more or less is of great importance, but it is well to know something about them.
Who is the gentleman?"

"I hardly think you would call him a gentleman," said Helen, "though he thinks he's one; I
wouldn't tolerate him a moment, only on my father's account. Dad calls him a political heeler,
and says he is very useful."

"He ought to be that," said Wade, smiling; "I'd hardly call him ornamental."

"Indeed he isn't," said Helen, pouting prettily, "and he presumes too much on Dad's favor.
He actually persecutes me with his attentions, but you know a politician's daughter has to
put up with a good deal, sometimes."

"I don't think you need to suffer much," said Wade, gallantly. "You will always find admirers
enough to stand between you and any trouble you may have. I rather think there is one of them
coming this way at the moment. I shall certainly take pleasure in recognizing Mr. Moran as
an enemy, but is this likely to be another one?"

"Oh, no," said Helen, laughingly, as an effeminate looking young man came up, evidently in
search of her.

"I beg pardon, Miss Helen," he said, with a bow that seemed to include Wade, politely enough,
in the apology, "But your mother asked me to find you. She wants you to meet some new guests
who have just arrived."

"Oh, bother," said Helen carelessly. "She can look after them for a while. Tell her I'll be
with her by-and-by," and she turned back to Wade, paying no further attention to the luckless
messenger, who departed, hiding his chagrin as best he could, though not very successfully.

After he had gone, she said, "No, I don't think Maxwell Frayne is likely to be an enemy; at
least, not one that you need fear. He is a gentleman, though he is too insipid to interest me."

"And you think Moran is a man to fear," asked Wade, trying to speak gravely, but showing amusement
in spite of himself.

"I don't believe you fear the devil," said Helen, with open admiration, "but Race Moran can
be very dangerous, and I feel sure he will try to injure you, if he ever finds a chance."

"Well in that case he will at least be interesting," said Wade, lightly. He would have been
amazed if he had realized at the time how prophetic the girl's words were.

For the moment, however, he had little thought of peril and adventures to come. The time, the
girl and the place, were all at hand, and he plunged headlong into a complication that kept
him for weeks in Chicago, strongly inclined to stay permanently, yet reluctant to settle in
a city so little to his liking, when the great out-doors was calling to him so urgently.

While the petals of the passion flower were unfolding so rapidly in the conservatory, Race
Moran had taken the Senator to the latter's private room where they had had many secret conferences
before. He had done the great man favors in New York where he was a valuable cog in the political
machine, while the Senator was still a newcomer in the field, and with accurate judgment he
had foreseen that Rexhill would be a winner.

Quick to see opportunities, he had cultivated the latter's acquaintance and courted his favor
until he had become the Senator's most trusted adherent, and was admitted to the closest intimacy,
so that he had become a constant visitor in the Rexhill home, and had definitely determined
in his own mind, to become one of the family. He knew well enough that Helen disliked him,
but his ideas of women had been gained from association with a class that is easily dominated,
and he was confident of his own powers, which, in fact, were very considerable.

The Senator was not blind to the other's purpose, but though he was far from approving it,
having other ideas concerning the daughter he idolized, he had not sought to discourage Moran,
nor did he intend to. He would let him go on until a crisis should come, and in the meantime,
Moran had not declared himself.

Helen's insolence at the door of the conservatory, however, had stung Moran, and as soon as
he had the Senator in seclusion, he broke out.

"Who is that puppy Helen has on a string to-night?" he demanded roughly.

But the Senator could overlook rudeness when it suited his purpose to do so.

"I wouldn't call him a puppy exactly," he said, pleasantly enough; "he is a good deal younger
than you and I, but he comes of pretty good stock in your town, Moran, and Stout tells me he
has distinguished himself already in two or three ways. I reckon he'd be a pretty good friend
to have, if he ever takes an interest in politics."

"Oh, I know the Wade family all right," said Moran impatiently; "they belong to the silk stockings,
but we have our own way of dealing with that kind in New York, and I'm able to do the same
thing anywhere else, if I have to. Maybe I will have to if he comes between me and Helen. Senator,
I want to marry that girl myself. I ain't asking your consent, exactly, for me and her will
be likely to do what we want to, anyhow, but I'd a heap rather have you favor the match."

That was almost too much, but the Senator knew his man and also knew how valuable he was. There
was no sense in breaking with him until it was unavoidable, so he still spoke pleasantly, though
he had flushed with anger for a moment.

"Yes, I reckon you and Helen will do as you like about it, especially as Helen likes. It was
sort of decent of you to speak to me first, but there doesn't seem to be anything particular
for me to say till you find out what Helen really thinks."

"Oh, I'll find that out, all right," said Moran, boastfully. "But this Wade person better look
out; I might have him run into the river some night, if he pokes his nose in too far."

"I'd go easy on that, if I were you," said the Senator laughing heartily, "a dead Wade might
interfere with your plans worse than a live one."

"Oh, of course," replied Moran, refusing to laugh. "I talk foolish with my mouth sometimes,
when I'm mad, but all the same, he'd better look out."

"Now I wonder," said the Senator thoughtfully, after the other had left him, "how long it will
be before he does find out, and how serious it will be. He's hit pretty hard, but I will have
to keep him along some way or other; I can't afford to lose him."

And he sat musing over his cigar till one by one his guests had gone, but not until the great
drawing room was well-nigh empty, did Helen leave the conservatory.

For a few weeks thereafter Chicago seemed, to Gordon Wade's fancy, to be the very center of
the Universe. Gradually, however, the sturdy nature of the man asserted itself, and realizing
that for him there were many more desirable places, he determined to look farther before choosing
a permanent home. He told Helen frankly of his purpose, and to his great satisfaction she approved.
There was no definite word of marriage between them, though they both looked forward to it
and both, at the time of parting, deemed the understanding complete between them.

Helen would have had him turn to the East, for her heart was set on city life in one of the
world's great capitals, but he declared he must see the West before deciding, and though she
was dissatisfied, she was too wise to seek the domination she intended, at that stage of the game.

He departed, therefore, to find in Wyoming later on, his ideal of a home. His thought of Chicago
thereafter, was that of the place where the girl he thought he loved was waiting for him, to
claim her, so soon as his home was made suitable. There was much to do by way of preparation,
however, and almost imperceptibly his ardor cooled as he found himself becoming prominent among
the bold and independent citizens who were rapidly putting Wyoming on the map.

CHAPTER III

JEALOUSY

Meantime, many things of great interest to Gordon Wade happened without his knowledge.

A national election at which the previously dominant party was defeated, was a sad blow to
Senator Rexhill, who not only suffered in prestige but in pocket. There was no question, even
in the minds of his friends, that he frequently used his political influence to back up the
many business enterprises in which he held an interest, and in which the greater part of his
quickly-made fortune was invested. With the loss of his political pull, disaster came to one
after another of those enterprises, and his successive losses were soon heavy enough to drive
him almost to desperation.

His previous successes, however, had all been due to the audacity of his plans, for his boldness
and courage were unquestionable. For a time he felt confident of winning again, and accordingly,
maintained his lavish expenditures and luxurious style of living, with no word of caution to
his wife and daughter, and he continued to seek for the long chances in business that offered
the largest risks and the greatest gains.

All the redeeming qualities of his nature (and he had more than his enemies gave him credit
for), were shown in his family life, and it was not surprising that Helen and her mother were
both undisturbed by the gathering storm, but continued to live as he encouraged them to, having
perfect confidence in his ability to overcome any and all the difficulties he might encounter.

Mrs. Rexhill continued to dream of social distinction. Failing to see that she had lost much
of her own prestige by the Senator's political reverses, she continued to entertain so extravagantly
in her palatial home, that she was still tolerated and she took infinite satisfaction in the
position she thought she occupied.

She considered Chicago the greatest city in the world, and she dreamed of Helen as its queen.
To her mind, the easiest way to accomplish that ambition was to persuade Helen to marry Maxwell
Frayne. He had persistently courted the girl ever since he first met her, and he was heir to
the great Frayne fortune.

The idea was not entirely revolting to Helen, though she had a small opinion of the elegant
young trifler who pursued her so persistently, for she, too, had social aspirations, though
being more clear-sighted than her mother, she dreamed of wider circles than those of Chicago.
Her husband, whoever he was to be, should take her to Paris, or at least to New York.

Her infatuation for Gordon Wade, however, was as strong as ever. Perhaps she was right in thinking
of it as true love, but she was greatly annoyed by Wade's choice of a ranchman's life, and
by his settling down out of the world, as she considered he had done. Her letters to him, tender
as they were, told him plainly enough of her dissatisfaction, and thereby undoubtedly contributed
to the slow growth of his indifference.

For a time she failed to perceive this, and enjoying the excitement of the life she was leading,
she was content to wait till Wade should tire of the wilderness, as she fully expected him
to do, and should return to her. So she drifted, until after a time her suspicions were aroused
by the tone of his letters, and she became anxious.

As time went on, Senator Rexhill's affairs became more and more involved. He realized that
he stood little chance of reëlection, when his term of office should expire, and meantime,
his fortune dwindled rapidly, though he was still careful not to betray that fact at home.

Moran knew the situation perfectly well, but he remained outwardly loyal to his employer, partly
because of the latter's liberality, but more, perhaps, because of the hope he still had of
winning Helen eventually, despite the dislike she took no pains to hide.

Knowing how bold the Senator was in his speculations, he came to him one day with an exciting
story.

"There's a guy in town," he said, "who may be just a plain nut, but he has the name of being
a scientific sharp who knows his business from A to Izzard, and he's either got something almighty
big, or he's got the willies.

"What he says is, that he's found gold in a new spot and oodles of it. According to what he
tells, it beats California in '49. It's so big, he says, that he's scared stiff, thinking he
can't grab enough of it, and he don't know, no more'n a baby, what to do with it. So he's looking
for somebody to take hold of it in a big way and give him a whack."

"Where is this gold?" asked the Senator incredulously.

"That's the funny part of it," says Moran; "it's in Wyoming, and as near as I can make out,
it must be close to where that young squirt is that Helen thinks she's stuck on. I'm not sure
but what it's on his place, but even if it is, there is no reason why he should have any of
it. The expense will be pretty heavy to do the thing up right, but if you're game, I reckon
we can hog the whole business. We can stall this scientific nut off with promises, and probably
buy off Wade for the price of pasture land, and then file claim on the whole dog-gone tract."

This vision of enormous wealth was captivating to the Senator, who had made his first start
in mining and knew something of its possibilities. Bold as he was, however, he was also cautious,
but after several conferences with Moran, he fell in with the scheme, first securing the services
of a skilled metallurgist and an equally capable engineer, who were liberally paid and solemnly
sworn to secrecy. He sent them out to verify the discoverer's story, and sent Moran to Crawling
Water, to establish himself, and to do such preparatory work as should be necessary. In due
time, Moran reported by letter that the gold was located, and was beyond question abundant.
He was having trouble, however, in getting the property, as Wade refused to sell.

"Of course," he wrote, "we can file mining claims on the ground we know of, and get possession
that way, but we want to make more surveys before doing that, so as to be sure of getting all
there is, and we can't do that without giving the whole snap away, and filling the mountains
full of prospectors. If that damn Wade won't sell, I'll find some means to drive him away."

It was just after the receipt of this letter, which filled the Senator with hope on the one
hand, and anxiety on the other that he came on Helen one evening, as she was entering her own
sitting room, and followed her in for a chat.

"What are you thinking of?" he asked, presently, when she failed to notice some trivial question
he had asked, and seemed to be in a reverie.

She looked at him with laughing eyes.

"Crawling Water."

"Gordon Wade, eh? Well, I wouldn't think of him too much. Better let that pass. You've outgrown
it."

"Oh, no I haven't."

The Senator sighed.

"Mother said to me a little while ago, that he was probably going with other girls and forgetting
me, and it made me angry."

"Well, I reckon your mother is about right. Gordon is a likely looking chap, you know. I've
got nothing against him, except that he isn't good enough for you; no man is. You don't really
care so much for him, do you?"

"Oh, don't I?" She viewed her father through half closed lids, in a quizzical way. "I care
so very much for him that if I really thought there was another girl, I would go to Crawling
Water to-morrow. You'd have to drop everything and take me."

Her father gently pinched her cheek.

"I would, eh? Well, maybe I'll have to go out there anyway. But do you realize what Crawling
Water is like,--a rough, frontier town?"

"I wouldn't mind that for a while."

"No, I suppose not. You've got too much of your old dad in you to balk at a few difficulties.
There's somebody else out there who'd be mighty glad to see your pretty face. Race Moran."

"Mr. Moran!"

The sudden change in the girl's tone from tenderness to scorn caused the Senator a twinge of
uneasiness. His plans were so closely linked with Moran's for the present, that the man might
prove dangerous if his love for Helen were too openly scorned. That she could scarcely tolerate
him, despite his ability and force of character, her father knew from the past; but even in
the moment of his need he did not seek to influence her in Moran's favor. His love for her
was genuine and very deep.

"He's been out there for some time, as my agent."

"Yes, I know that. He--he has written to me, although I've never answered his letters. I've
been curious to hear from him again, because he promised to send me some kodaks of Crawling Water."

"Maybe he hasn't done so because you've ignored his letters."

Helen's lip curled in disdain.

"He'd never let a little thing like that stop him. But perhaps I will answer the next one,
if only to find out what is going on out there. It's all so very mysterious. Do you know, father,"--She
playfully shook her finger at him--"this is the first time in a long while that you haven't
taken me into your confidence, and I think it a very ominous sign. I'm sure you'll be punished
for it."

The Senator winced at the word punished, and Helen laughed at what she thought was the effect
of her raillery.

"Why don't you tell me? You see, I'm so worried about Gordon. Honestly, father, I'm serious
about that. I--I love him, and I don't want him hurt."

"Hurt? Why, who is thinking of hurting him?"

"Oh, I don't know. Moran hates him, and has referred to him once or twice in a way that I do
not understand. Do tell me all about it."

"Oh, well, my dear, there's really nothing to tell. It's all concerned with some homestead
lands out there that I want to get hold of for an investment. Wade will not be hurt, no; that
is, he won't be if he beats me out. If I win, he'll lose."

"He will?"

"We both can't win, of course. It's to be a fight, yes,--an amicable business struggle, I hope.
There's no reason for it to be otherwise." The Senator appeared strangely nervous, despite
his effort at self-control. "Wade as a man and a Westerner doesn't expect to be fed on pap,
you know, any more than I do. May the best man win, that's the way of it."

Helen thought this over for a moment.

"Perhaps I'd better go out there with you, after all," she remarked, half in jest.

Then the Senator thought that over for a moment and left the room.

Next day Helen received a package by mail which proved to contain a dozen clear photographs
of Crawling Water and its neighborhood.

First of all, as though Moran thought it most important, was a snapshot of himself, which had
been taken, so he wrote on the back of the print, by an obliging cowboy. The girl's face was
a study in amused scorn as she looked at the photograph, for which Moran has posed with a cigar
in his mouth, his hands in his pockets.

Then there were a number of views of the town itself; of its main street, its hotel, its dance-hall,
and of "some of the boys" in various poses of photographic self-consciousness. There were also
pictures of the marvelously beautiful countryside, but as she neared the end of them, Helen
was disappointed to find none of Wade. "Of course, he wouldn't send me one of him," she said
petulantly to herself, and she was rapidly running through the remaining prints only to pause
suddenly at the very last, while a rosy tide flooded her face and neck.

The little photograph showed a tall, handsome, vigorous looking man, in the garb of a cattleman,
half turned in his saddle, with one hand resting on his pony's flank. The man was Wade. With
his other hand, he was pointing ahead, apparently for the benefit of a girl--a very good looking
girl whose fine head was thrown back, as the wind blew her hair into pretty disorder.

Helen Rexhill had not hitherto experienced real jealousy, but this little photograph excited
it. In the highly actinic light of Crawling Water at noon the camera had done its work well,
and the figures of the two stood out from the distant background with stereoscopic clearness.
Wade was smiling at the girl, who seemed to be laughing back at him, although her face in the
picture was partially turned away, so that Helen got only an impression of charm. But the impression
was enough to rouse her jealousy.

On the back of the print, Moran had written:

"A surprise picture of Gordon Wade and our new fellow-townswoman, Miss Dorothy Purnell, whose
beauty and general attractiveness have made her the idol of Crawling Water."

CHAPTER IV

THE GATHERING STORM

On the north bank of the river, from which it derived its name, the town of Crawling Water
lay sprawled out in the shape of an irregular horn. Its original settlers had been men of large
ideas, and having had plenty of space at their disposal, they had used it lavishly. The streets,
bordered by dusty, weather-beaten, frame buildings, were as wide as those of a large city;
indeed, in area, the town could compete with many a metropolis; but there the resemblance ended.
Crawling Water was not fated to become a big city. The fact that the nearest railroad point
was at Sheridan, forty miles away, did away with any ambitions that Crawling Water might have
had to be more than a neighborhood center.

The mixed population was composed of cattlemen, sheep men, cow punchers and herders, with a
sprinkling of gamblers and other riff-raff. Rough, uncouth, full-blooded men, they were, for
the most part; hard working; decisive in their likes and dislikes; fearing neither God nor
man, they met Life as they found it and faced Death with a laugh. They were the last of a fast
disappearing type, picturesque, but lacking in many of the attributes which differentiate mankind
from the beasts.

Hardly more than a village, Crawling Water was yet a town, and the seat of such machinery of
government as had been established, and accordingly, Gordon Wade had ridden directly thither
after his far from satisfactory interview with Oscar Jensen. After he had stabled his horse
and seen it fed, he started up the street in the direction of Moran's office. He was resolved
to find out where the agent stood on the sheep question without any unnecessary delay. Save
for a few dogs, sleeping in the blaze of the noon-day sun, which hung overhead like a ball
of fire, the town seemed deserted.

When Wade entered the office, Moran was seated at his desk, chewing on a cigar, above which
his closely cropped reddish mustache bristled. Like Senator Rexhill, he was a man of girth
and bulk, but his ape-like body was endowed with a strength which not even his gross life had
been able to wreck, and he was always muscularly fit. Except for the miner's hip boots, which
he wore, he was rather handsomely dressed, and would have been called tastefully so in the
betting ring of a metropolitan race-track, where his diamond scarf-pin and ring would have
been admired.

"Hello!" he boomed as Wade entered. "Have a cigar." He pushed a box of an excellent brand toward
his visitor and waved him to a chair. His greeting was noisy rather than cordial.

Wade declined both the chair and the cigar.

"I dropped in to find out why you told Jensen to run his sheep in on my range," he began bluntly.

"Let me see--" The agent very deliberately lifted a large, white hand and took the cigar out
of his mouth. "Just what range is that?"

"The upper valley range which I have under lease."

"Which you have under lease?" Moran affected sarcastic surprise. "I wasn't aware that you had
any legal right to that part of the valley. It's government land, ain't it?"

"You seem to have forgotten that you once tried to buy the lease from me." The rancher bared
his teeth in a grim smile. "We'll not quibble over that, however. We've got our legal rights,
all of us; but we're a long distance from the courts here. What I want to know in plain English
is, will you order Jensen to trail those sheep? Now, wait a moment!"

Moran subsided with a show of tolerance he did not feel.

"Think well before you answer," Wade went on. "I'm not here to threaten you, but there are
desperate men in this valley who will take matters into their own hands, if this business is
not stopped. There's plenty of grass on the other side of the mountains and your sheep are
welcome to it. Why don't you make use of it?"

"Why should I? The sheep have a right to be where they are and there they'll stay until I get
ready to move 'em. You cattlemen think you own this country, but when it comes to the show
down, you're a bunch of bluffers. Now, Wade, I made you an offer once,--I'll admit it, and
I'll make it again for the last time. Sell me your homestead and lease rights at the price
I offered you--ten thousand dollars, and get out smiling. There isn't room for the two of us
in the valley."

"Ten thousand for the homestead and the lease combined!" Wade laughed mirthlessly. "You're
crazy, man. Why, you offered me that much for the lease alone a few weeks ago."

"Did I? I'd forgotten it. Anyway, it's a fair offer. The land is still owned by Uncle Sam,
you know. You haven't proved up on your claims, and you never will if I can help it. We are
spending lots of money here, and the government will see that our interests are protected.
You cattlemen can't hog the whole of Crawling Water Valley. Times have changed. Well, what
do you say?"

The ranchman dismissed the proposition with a gesture, but did not immediately speak. Silently,
the two big men faced each other, their glances crossing like rapiers: the cattleman like a
statue in bronze in the fixed rigidity of his attitude, but with an expression that showed
him one dangerous to trifle with; the agent affecting that half tolerant amusement which one
may feel toward an enemy unworthy of one's prowess. Wade presently broke the silence.

"Moran, you may be a big man in the East, but you're not big enough for the job you've tackled
here. I've held my friends back as long as I can--longer than I thought I could--and when they
break loose, this valley will be a little hell, perhaps a shambles. Men are going to be killed,
and I have a feeling that you are going to be one of them. Against that time, once more, I
warn you. Tell Jensen to trail his sheep!"

Swinging on his heel, the ranchman left the office, paying no attention to the ironical "Good
night," which Moran called after him.

In the street, Wade chanced upon a neighboring cattle owner, Lem Trowbridge of the Circle Heart
outfit, who fell into step with him.

"Gordon, how long are we going to stand for this thing, eh? Say, do you know what some are
saying about you? Now, I'm your friend, and I'm telling you straight that you've gone far enough
with this pacifist stuff."

"They say I'm afraid, I suppose?" Wade stopped and faced Trowbridge. "Have they said that to you?"

"To me? Say, what the ---- kind of a friend do you take me for?" Trowbridge flamed up like
a match. "No, they haven't said just that, Gordon; but they're hinting, and I don't like it."

"Well, if you hear it direct, send the man on to me with it," said Wade, his lips compressing
ominously. "I'm about through, Lem, not quite, but pretty nearly. I've told Moran to have Jensen
trail those sheep, and if he doesn't...."

Trowbridge nodded and smiled, as they paused at a street corner--one of the few that Crawling
Water possessed.

"That's the idea, Gordon. We'll all be the readier for the waiting. Well, I'll not go any farther
with you." He winked with elaborate precision and looked in the direction of a snug little
cottage, with flower boxes in the windows, a biscuit toss away. "She's home. I saw her leave
the store yonder a little while ago."

Wade blushed like a boy and looked foolish.

"I don't get into town so very often," he began lamely, when Trowbridge slapped him heartily
on the back.

"You don't need to make any excuses to me, old man," he said, moving off. "That little woman
has put Crawling Water on edge with admiration. You're not the only one--or, maybe, you are."

Secretly eager though Wade was to reach the cottage, the nearer he approached it, the slower
he walked, fuming at himself for his sudden spinelessness. Although no ladies' man, he had
never been woman wary until lately, and this of itself was a sign, the significance of which
he was far from realizing. When he was with Dorothy Purnell, he almost forgot her sex in the
easy companionability of their relationship; when away from her, he thought no more of her
than he might of some man friend; but the approach had become a matter of embarrassing difficulty
with him. There had even been occasions when he had walked past the cottage and ridden home
without seeing her, trying speciously to convince himself that such had all along been his
intention.

Something of the sort might have happened now had she not hailed him from the open doorway.

"Whither bound, stranger?" she smilingly demanded, in her low, rich contralto. "Better come
in where it's cool. Mother'll be glad to see you, and I--shan't mind."

She had come to Crawling Water for the restorative effect of the bracing mountain air upon
the health of her mother, who was threatened with nervous invalidism, following the death of
Mr. Purnell, two years before. The town called them Easterners because their home was as far
East as Michigan, but they had never been city dwellers, as Dorothy's fresh complexion and
lithe, alert figure bore witness.

Her chestnut hair, piled in a silken crown on her shapely head, shaded a face that made those
who saw it for the first time, catch their breath in instant admiration. Her radiance was of
a glorious, compelling, and wholly distinct type, as refreshing as some view of green mountains
from out a gloomy canyon. She had eyes, blue in repose, but shading to violet tints when aglow
with vivacity; her nose was not perfect, because a trifle tip-tilted, but her face gained character
through the defect; her very red lips held most delicious allurement in their slightly full
curves. Her hands and feet were small enough to pay tribute to her birth and breeding, but
not so small as to be doll-like. She wore a simple, white dress, freshly laundered, which made
her look cool and inviting.

"You won't mind? Now that's good of you, and no mistake." Wade shook hands with her, slowly
relinquishing her cool palm. "How is Mrs. Purnell? Better?"

"Oh, yes, I think so. You're better, aren't you, mother?" she asked, as they entered the cozy
little living-room, where the temperature was in pleasant contrast to the outer heat. "The
air up here does you good, doesn't it?"

Mrs. Purnell, a dispirited little person, admitted that she felt very well indeed, and seemed
cheered at the sight of Wade, who greeted her deferentially but with easy geniality. She liked
him for his wholesomeness, and she frequently declared that he was worth all the doctors in
the country because of the impression of health and optimism which he bore with him. But she
was aware that Dorothy liked him, too, and so presently made an excuse to leave the two young
people together.

"Now, you may tell me all about what's worrying you," the girl said, seating herself across
from Wade. "Something is. You can't keep the signs from me."

"Good girl!" His voice held a suggestion of tenderness, as he rolled and lighted a cigarette,
in the home-like privilege which they allowed him there. "That's your way, always. No matter
who's in trouble, you are ready to hasten to the rescue."

"Oh--," she deprecatingly began, with a trace of violet showing in her eyes, which meant a
great deal more than words.

"No wonder every man in the valley considers himself your own, especial knight."

"I thought perhaps I could help you," she said briskly, to cover her sentimental moment. "But
that was foolish of me, too, wasn't it? The idea of any one helping you."

"I'm likely to need all my friends soon, Dorothy," Wade answered soberly. "I came in to-day
to see Race Moran. There's a big band of sheep on our upper range, and Jensen, who has charge
of them, admitted to me this morning that Moran is behind him."

"Goodness, more sheep! Wherever do they come from?"

"I don't know where they come from, but they can't stay where they are unless I go out of business,
that's certain." In a few words, he explained to her the significance of the movement, and
told her of his talk with Moran. "I've no use for the man," he concluded, "and if it comes
to a showdown between us, he need expect no sympathy. I've held back as long as I can. I understand
better than he does what the crack of the first rifle will lead to."

"You have not liked him since you found that he took that snapshot of me," she said whimsically.
"I didn't mind, but I can't imagine what he wanted it for."

Wade's face darkened.

"It was a confounded impertinence, whatever he wanted with it. But my dislike of him goes farther
back than that."

"What are you going to do?" she asked, resting her chin in her hand, and looking him straight
in the eyes, as she always did to those with whom she talked.

"It largely depends on him. Santry--you know how hot-headed he is--would run the herders away
by force and kill off the sheep. As a last resort, of course, we may have to do something like
that, but I want to win this fight without open violence if we can. A faction war, in the end,
would be likely to ruin us all."

"You must be careful," the girl declared earnestly. "Moran is not going to be an easy man to
handle. He seems to have plenty of money, and they say here in town that he stands in with
the government; that he has some sort of 'pull.' He's clever, I think. He'll trick you if he can."

"I'm sure of that, Dorothy, but we're not going to let him. If only...! Say, do you know something
else that is being said in this town? Something that they're saying about me?"

"Something nice?" her tone was archly inquiring.

He leaned forward and lightly rested his hand on her knee, just as he might have done with
a man friend, and she took as little notice of it. His fingers were trembling a little under
the stress of the emotion he felt.

"They're saying, those who don't like me, I guess, that I'm afraid of Moran and his crowd;
afraid of a lot of sheep herders. No, of course, my friends don't believe it," he hastened
to add when she started to interrupt. "But it's not doing me any good, especially now that
public feeling is running so high."

"But you mustn't mind what they say, Gordon. That's part of the courage your friends know that
you have; to do what you feel to be right, no matter what is said."

Her cheeks were glowing with indignation, and he appreciatively patted her hand before sitting
erect in his chair again. It was no wonder, he reflected, in that almost womanless land, that
many a cowpuncher rode the range by night, seeing her image in every star. The thought that
each single man, and many a married one, in Crawling Water, would ride into the Pit itself
to win one of her smiles, had been Wade's comfort, even when he was thinking of the possibility
of bloodshed between the two hostile factions. But now, in the moment of her sympathy for him,
he felt that he could not be content without some further assurance of her safety.

"What you say sounds well, Dorothy, but my pride's working on me, too, now. I can't help it.
If my friends, who have been good enough to accept my leadership so far, should lose their
heads and go to it without me, I might talk afterward until Kingdom come. I'd never convince
anybody that I hadn't funked the thing. You spoke a few minutes ago of helping me. You can
help me a great deal."

Her lovely face instantly blazed with eagerness.

"Can I? How?"

"By promising me that, if it comes to a fight, you and your mother will come out to my ranch.
You'd be safer there. That is, of course, unless you'd prefer to leave Crawling Water altogether."

"Indeed, I shouldn't prefer to leave Crawling Water at this stage of the game, and"--she smiled
reassuringly--"I'm sure we should be safe enough right here whatever happened. But, if you'd
feel better about it, we would go to the ranch."

"Thanks. I feel better about it already, more free to show my hand. You are safe enough here
now, of course, and might be clear through to the finish; but cheap whiskey has led many a
fairly good man astray."

"If only there were some peaceable way out of it all." Her eyes became anxious as she thought
of what he might have to face. "Can't you telegraph to Washington, or something?"

"Washington doesn't know whether Crawling Water is in the United States or in Timbuctoo," Wade
laughed. "If we had some one in authority right here on the ground we might make him understand,
but Mahomet will never come to these mountains, and they can't go to Mahomet. Why, what's the
matter?"

His question was prompted by the sudden elation with which she had clapped her hands and sprung
to her feet.

"How stupid of me, Gordon, to have forgotten." She stood over him with shining eyes and eager
countenance, as lovely as a Lorelei. "There is an official of the United States Government
here at this very moment."

"Here? In Crawling Water?" he exclaimed in amazement. "Who is he?"

"Senator Rexhill, Gordon." Wade stared almost vacuously at her as she ran on with her news.
"He came in with his daughter last night on the Sheridan stage. Isn't that glorious? You must
go up to see him at once."

"I will, of course," Wade said slowly, trying to catch his mental balance. "And with pleasure,
too. It's been a long time since I last saw either of them."

"You know them--him?" Dorothy hesitated a little over which pronoun to use, with the somewhat
disturbing reflection that Helen Rexhill was a most beautiful and distinguished looking girl.
"That will make it all the easier," she added generously.

"Of course, Senator Rexhill has no authority of his own in such a matter, you know; but if
we can get him interested, he may wake up Washington in our behalf. Only, I don't see what
can have brought him to Crawling Water."

"Do you--do you know the daughter well?" Dorothy asked, with feminine cogency. "I suppose you
met her back East?"

"We've known each other for a number of years." He arose, his face expressive of the delight
he felt at the Rexhills' presence in town. "We used to be good friends. You'll like her. But
it's strange they didn't tell me of their coming. You'll pardon me if I hurry over to the hotel,
won't you, Dorothy?"

She gently urged him out of the house.

"Of course! Don't waste a moment, and let me know just as soon as you can what the outcome
is. I do hope the Senator can settle all this trouble."

"I want you to meet them right away," he called, over his shoulder, and when he looked back
for his answer, she nodded brightly.

But as she turned back into the cottage after watching him swing up the street she was not
at all sure that she would like Helen Rexhill.

CHAPTER V

TREACHERY

Overjoyed at the prospect of a peaceful solution of the problem which confronted him, Wade
walked rapidly toward the hotel, happy, too, in the thought of meeting Helen Rexhill.

Whether he loved her with the single-hearted devotion which a man should feel toward his future
wife, he was not sure; but he was confident that he did not love any one else. The idea of
love in connection with Dorothy had never occurred to him; she was his good friend, nothing
more. To Helen, belonged the romance of his life, fostered in other years by the distinct preference
she had shown for him. At one time, they had been reported engaged, and although the word had
never actually passed between them, many things more significant than speech had contributed
to the warm regard which they felt for each other. Beneath Helen's reputed coldness of heart
lay intense feeling, and on numerous occasions she had verged on unwomanliness in baring her
moods to Wade, in a way that many other men would have been quicker to fathom, and perhaps
to take advantage of, than he had been.

Now, the knowledge that she was close at hand, and that he might see her at any moment, caused
his heart to beat rapidly. If to others she had been cool, to him she had been ardent, and
this warmth had been the one thing needful to make her physically captivating. Only when some
vital cause impends is a young man likely to distinguish between the impulses of his body and
the cravings of his soul, and no such vital exigency had as yet appeared in Wade's life. He
wondered if she was as beautiful as ever, and began to reproach himself for lack of ardor in
his recent letters to her, lest he should now be repaid in kind. He wanted to be received upon
the old, delicious footing, with her in his arms, and her lips trembling beneath his.

There were dozens of men in Washington and New York who would almost have bartered their souls
for such privilege, and Gordon Wade need not be decried for his moment of passionate yearning.
He was enough of a man to put the thought aside, pending his interview with the Senator, which
was his first purpose. He felt sure that if Senator Rexhill could be moved to interest in Crawling
Water affairs, his influence would be potent enough to secure redress for the cattlemen, and
Wade meant to pull every string that could bear upon so happy a result. He was glad that Mrs.
Rexhill had not made the journey, for he was conscious of her hostility to him, and he felt
that his chances of moving her husband were better without her.

When he inquired at the hotel, he was told that the Rexhills were in, and he presently found
himself shaking hands with the Senator, who greeted him with effusive warmth.

"Helen is changing her gown and will be in shortly," the big man explained. "I'm mighty glad
to see you, Gordon. Only this morning we were talking of looking you up. How are you? Sit down,
my boy, sit down!"

"Senator," Wade began, after they had exchanged commonplaces for a few moments. "Glad as I
am to see you, on my own account, I am more than glad in behalf of my friends, who have not
yet had the pleasure of meeting you. Your arrival in Crawling Water could not possibly have
been more opportune. You have come just in time to save us, most likely, from an internecine
strife which might have ruined us all. I was more glad than I can tell you to learn that you
were here."

"Indeed, Gordon? I--I am much interested. Perhaps, you will...."

While Wade succinctly sketched the situation, the Senator nervously toyed with his eyeglasses,
now and then lifting his double chin from the confinement of his collar, only to let the mass
of flesh settle again into inertness. He thought rapidly. Evidently, Moran had not divulged
the fact that he, the Senator, was concerned in the Crawling Water enterprise. Certainly, Moran
had done very well in that, and Rexhill almost wished now that he had been less precipitate
in coming to Crawling Water. If he had stayed in the East, his complicity in the affair might
possibly have been concealed to the very end. He hastily considered the advisability of remaining
under cover; but now that he was on the ground he decided that he had better be open and above
board, in so far at least as he could be so. It would prove awkward in the event of subsequent
investigation, if he should be made to appear in the guise of a deliberate conspirator.

So, presently, as Wade neared the end of his résumé of the situation, Rexhill permitted an
oleaginous smile to overspread his countenance. At the last, he even chuckled.

"It's really a bit amusing. No, no, not what you have said, my boy; but what I am about to
say to you. You invoke my influence to stop these--er--depredations, as you call them, and
up to a certain point, you shall have my aid, because I seem to see that matters have gone
a bit beyond bounds. But when you ask me to go to extremes myself, why, I'm bound to tell you
that I, too, have interests at stake. Why do you suppose I came to Crawling Water?"

"I'll admit that puzzled me."

Rexhill looked keenly at Wade, wondering if he were foolish enough to believe the trip a sentimental
journey, purely. He concluded that the young ranchman had too much sense to jump at such a
conclusion.

"Well, the reason is...." The Senator leaned ponderously forward, twiddling his glasses upon
his thumb. "The reason is that I, if you please, am the moving spirit behind the company which
Race Moran is representing here. You see...." He chuckled plethorically again at Wade's start
of surprise. "It really is a bit amusing."

"Then Moran is your agent?"

"In a sense, yes."

"Well, I'll be damned!" The cattleman's tone was rich in disgust, but even more keen was his
intense disappointment at this failure of his hopes. "Would you mind telling me, Senator, just
what the purpose of your company is?"

"Certainly not. It's no secret," Rexhill replied briskly. "Certain parties back East, myself
included, as I've told you, have reason to believe that a railroad will be put through this
valley in the near future. This is an extremely rich and productive section, with natural resources
which will make it heard from some day, so we are anxious to obtain a portion of the valley
for speculative purposes. If the railroad comes through we'll probably build a town somewhere
nearby and open up an irrigation project we have in mind. If not, we'll use our holdings to
raise wheat and livestock. The proposition is a sound investment either way you look at it."

"A few years ago," said Wade, "I and several others leased upwards of twenty thousand acres
of grass land here in the valley for stock grazing purposes. I, personally, filed a claim on
the land I now call my home ranch. Our lease, which is direct from the Government, gives us
entire control of the land so long as we pay for it.

"Besides ourselves, there are a number of ranches in the valley, all of them cattle and horse
outfits. There has always been a tacit agreement that sheep should not be grazed here because
sheep and cattle can't live on the same range in large numbers. Until Moran came here, we had
no trouble whatever--the sheep ranchers kept to their own side of the mountains and we cattlemen
kept to ours. Since Moran has arrived, however, the sheep have crossed the Divide in thousands,
until the entire valley is being overrun with them.

"Only this morning, Moran admitted to me that the sheep men are acting with his authority and
backing. Senator Rexhill, this is wrong, and your agent, or manager, is making a big mistake.
Since you are the prime mover in this matter, your arrival is even more opportune than I at
first thought, because you have the power to immediately correct your hired man's mistake.
So far as we cattle ranchers can learn, Moran is bringing sheep in here with the deliberate
intention of starving us out of our homes. He seems to want our range and he--I'll not say
you--thinks that such a course is the cheapest way to gain possession. He'll find it the dearest
in the end. Unless the sheep are moved mighty soon, we shall be mixed up in one of the bloodiest
little wars in the history of the range country. Mark you, I'm no firebrand,--some call me
too conservative; but we have about reached the limit, and something is bound to happen before
many days."

Senator Rexhill drummed with his fingers on the table.

"Um! Does Moran know of this attitude in you and your friends, Gordon?"

"Yes. I have just finished telling him of it. But he merely laughs at us. We are a long way
from the courts here, Senator, and we can't easily appeal to the authorities. We are obliged
to settle our differences among ourselves. Moran knows this as well as I do; but he forgets
that the thing can work two ways. Each day that the sheep are here in the valley they spoil
more grass than all our cattle could eat in a week; in two months, if the sheep stay, the range
will be as bare as a ball-room floor. Can you wonder that we ranchers are becoming desperate?"

"It's strange," Rexhill commented, apparently much perturbed. "Moran is not the sort to take
useless risks. He's dominant, but he's no fool. Well, my boy, I'll talk this over with him;
in fact, I really came out here to see how things were shaping up. If things can be peacefully
arranged, that's the way we want them. We're not looking for trouble. Certainly, you are quite
right to object to sheep being run on your leased pasture. I'll look into it right away and
see what can be done."

"Thank you." Wade was much relieved and he showed it. "I felt sure that an appeal to your sense
of fair play would not be fruitless. I'm mighty glad you are in town."

"Gordon!" a girl's voice exclaimed softly behind him.

"Helen!" He sprang to his feet and turned to seize her hands.

Those who admired Helen Rexhill at Washington social functions never saw her look more lovely
than she did at this moment of meeting with Wade, for the reason that all the skill of the
costumer could not beautify her so much as the radiance of love now in her face. The dress
she wore was far from inexpensive, but it was cut with the art which conceals art, and to Wade
it appeared simple.

Yet his first sensation was one of acute disappointment, which he strove rather ineffectually,
to conceal. Doubtless, this was because his recollection of her had soared beyond the bounds
of human perfection. But the gown, which she had chosen with so keen a wish to impress him,
reminded him of the simple frocks which Dorothy Purnell wore, and in Helen Rexhill's face there
was not the same sweet simplicity of expression which distinguished her rival. Flaming love
was there, to transform her from the suggestion of a lily to that of a pomegranate; but it
was the love that demands and devours, rather than the constant affection which, in giving
all, seeks nothing but the privilege of loving in return. Without actually analyzing the impression
which Helen made upon him, Wade felt something of the truth of this, and was disappointed in
the realization of his dream of her. Materially she was too perfect, too exotic, for the setting
of Crawling Water.

"Why, you look just the same," she happily exclaimed. "And I? Have I changed? Now, be careful
what you say! You're not a bit of a courtier."

"Everything changes, doesn't it?" he said, slowly feeling his way. "Except the heart?" His
answer pleased her.

"Will you listen to that, Father? In the cattle country, too."

"Very pretty," the Senator observed judicially. "Inspired, perhaps."

"How long are you going to stay?" asked Wade.

Helen laughed happily.

"Perhaps that will depend upon how glad I think you are to have us."

She gave him an ardent glance, which he was not proof against, nor would any other man have
been so.

"No doubt of that." He laughed with her, his disappointment passing before the old love spell,
which she knew so well how to cast about him. "You couldn't have come at a better time, either,
for now there is some one here who can be company for you. That is," he added lamely, "when
you're tired of having me around."

"Really?" Helen was a bit chilled by this obvious faux pas. Truly, despite his worth as a man,
Gordon Wade was no courtier. "Who is it?"

"Of course, you haven't heard of her, but you'll like her. She's Miss Dorothy Purnell. Everybody
does like her."

Helen affected a gayety which she could scarcely have been expected to feel. Although she was
not socially adept in concealing her real feeling, Wade saw nothing wrong. Only the Senator
twisted his mouth in a grim smile.

"Oh, but I have heard of her; indeed, I have. Mr. Moran sent me a little photograph of you
both on horseback. Just see how her fame has crossed the continent. I shall be charmed to meet
her."

A great light dawned upon Wade.

"Then that was what he wanted with the picture," he exclaimed. "We wondered at the time. I
thought it pretty impudent of him, but, of course, if he wanted it just to send to you, that
was all right."

Miss Rexhill winced inwardly. In spite of herself, her face expressed a certain amount of pique,
for the implication was manifestly that if Race Moran had wanted the picture for himself, the
idea would have been intolerable to Wade.

"Oh, yes, quite all right. You seem...." She checked herself, with the reproach upon her tongue,
reflecting that, after all, she was most fond of Wade because of his naturalness. Maxwell Frayne,
for instance, was without a peer in spinning graceful phrases; but he spun little else.

"But I don't understand why he should send it to you," Wade said, in a low tone, as the Senator
turned to bend over an open traveling bag on a nearby chair. "Is he--do you--?" A slight rigor
of jealousy seemed to seize upon him, under the witchery of her slow smile.

"Oh, he's been writing to me, and I suppose he thought I'd be interested. Of course, I was."
She leaned toward him a trifle, a mere swaying of her body, like a lily in a breeze, and impulsively
he placed his big hand over hers.

"He'd better not--he'd better mind his own business!" he said grimly.

She laughed softly, tantalizingly, and being human, Wade kissed her; the Senator being still
busy with the contents of the bag.

Thus engaged, none of them heard a knock at the door, which finally opened before Moran, who,
even if he did not actually see the kiss, could hardly have failed to suspect it from their
embarrassed manner. Helen felt sure from his annoyed expression that he had witnessed the caress,
and she was rather glad of it.

He exchanged a slightly stiff greeting with the rancher, and then while Wade and Helen continued
their talk, the agent spoke in a carefully guarded undertone with his employer. The news he
brought, whatever it was, seemed significant, for the Senator appeared worried and presently
turned to Wade.

"You'll not mind if I go over to the office with Moran, Gordon?"

"Certainly not, Senator. Don't let me interrupt you. But what's the use of us staying indoors,
Helen? The sun has turned now and it's cooler out. I'll show you something of our little metropolis.
Or, I tell you what we'll do! Why not let me take you over and introduce you to the only woman
you're likely to find congenial in this neighborhood? She'll be glad to meet you, I know."

In any other company, Miss Rexhill would probably have resented an invitation to call upon
a rival, even apart from the ethics of social calls, but not before Race Moran. Before him,
she would not humble Wade in the least degree, if only because to do so would reflect upon
her own preference between the men. She could only pretend to welcome the prospect of going
to see Miss Purnell, and she played her part well.

"We may as well stay here now," Rexhill said, when the two young people had left the room.
"When did all this happen?"

"I just got word of it," Moran answered, a bit excitedly. "Don't you see how it plays right
into our hands? It's the greatest thing that could have happened for us. It might have been
made to order."

"Are you sure it wasn't? Are you sure you didn't have the man shot, Race?" Senator Rexhill's
tone was very dry and he watched his companion keenly as he asked the question.

Moran assumed an attitude of indignation.

"Why, Senator...!"

"Tush! I want to know where we stand. By God, Race, you mustn't go too far! We're traveling
mighty close to the wind as it is."

"But these brawls are likely to happen at any time. This one in particular has been brewing
for weeks. Why connect me with it, unnecessarily?"

"All right. I see your point, of course. The assassin is unknown; suspicion naturally falls
upon Wade, who is at the head of the cattle faction and who, as you say, threatened Jensen
only this morning. If we can jail him for awhile his party is likely to fall down."

"Exactly!" Moran cried eagerly. "Fortune has placed him right in our hands."

"Well, I'm not going to have him arrested," Rexhill announced doggedly, "at least, not on any
trumped up charge. He's broken my bread, Helen likes him. We call him a friend, in fact. I
always play square with my friends--as far as possible. Strategy is strategy, nobody can quarrel
with that; but this thing you propose is something more."

Moran, while listening, had restrained his impatience with difficulty. He not only had reason
on his side, but personal hate as well. His sense of triumph in bringing the news to Rexhill
had not been for their mutual cause alone; it had seemed to Moran to point toward the end of
his rivalry with Wade for the love of Helen. To have the fruits of victory snatched from him,
because of a sentiment of friendship, was almost more than the agent could stand for.

"Good God, Senator," he burst out, "don't throw this chance away! Think what it means to us!
We are running close to the wind, and until this moment, it's been a toss up whether we'd get
out of here with our lives; whether I would, at any rate. I've run a mighty big bluff on these
cattle people, but I did it because it was the only way. I've held my own so far, but when
they find out that it's not farm land we're after, but ore--why, Senator, there'll be no holding
them at all! With Wade at their head and forty miles between us and the cars, where would we
get off? We'd be lucky if we didn't swing from the limb of a tree. Do you suppose Wade would
remember then that he'd broken your bread? I'll bet dollars to doughnuts he wouldn't.

"But"--his voice sank to a significant whisper--"if we land him in jail...."

"His friends here would get him out," interposed the Senator, nervously wiping his glasses.

"Then Uncle Sam would put him in again, with a troop of cavalry to keep order here, and that
would be another advantage gained for our side. No, sir, once we get him in jail, we've got
the law with us and against him, don't forget that. Then the cattle party would lay mighty
low. Wade has been their leader right along. I tell you, it's the only way, and you know what
it means to us--to you."

"You don't have to tell me that," rasped Rexhill. "If we fail to put this through, I'm a ruined
man."

Moran's eyes gleamed.

"Well, then, it's the only way, unless--unless...."

"Unless what?"

"Unless your daughter marries him, and it all comes into the family." Upon that point, Moran
wished to know just where he stood.

"I've never made a dollar through my daughter yet, and I never will," said the Senator grimly.
"I'm not selling my own flesh and blood. I'll rot in the poor-house first."

Moran gently breathed his relief. He would have fought to the fullest extent of his power to
have aborted such a marriage, but if the Senator had favored it, he knew that it would have
been difficult to prevent.

"Wade has a foreman he's mighty fond of, an old man named Santry," the agent remarked, trying
another tack.

"That's a horse of another color." Rexhill appeared aroused, at last. "I remember the old fellow.
He must be nearly ready for the bone yard by this time anyhow. Saddle it on him, if you can.
Wade's devoted to him. He'd do as much for Santry as for himself, maybe more."

"I've heard about that kind of devotion," the agent sneered, "but I've yet to see a sample of it."

"Well, you may before long. Your first proposition's no good anyway. It would simply further
antagonize Wade's friends. It's quite possible, though, that Santry might have been mixed up
in such a brawl. Get him arrested, and then we'll let Wade know, gradually, that our influence
is at his command, for a price. I've no objection to that--none at all. By Heaven, we've got
to do something."

"We'll do it all right. I'll have a warrant sworn out."

"Meanwhile, Race, go easy with those sheep. Wade was telling me about them, and as a matter
of strategy, I had to pretend that I would help him. Move them across the Divide until we see
what comes of this Santry affair. I can't go too heavy with the boy right at the start."

"All right." Moran arose. "The sheep don't count much now anyway."

"I don't mind saying, Race," Senator Rexhill observed, a trifle pompously, "that you've done
pretty well so far. If you stick to it, you'll not find me ungrateful when the battle is over.
You'll be entitled to your reward."

Moran hesitated, seeming to summon courage to say something.

"Maybe you've guessed the reward I'll ask, Senator," he said slowly. "There are some things
that mean more to a man than mere money. I'm thinking of Miss Helen."

Rexhill found some difficulty in placing his gaze so that it would appear to naturally fall
elsewhere than on Moran. He was mortified by a sense of shame that he could not deal squarely
with this aspirant for his daughter's hand. He had been sincere in saying that he would never
barter her to further his own interests, but so much hung in the balance here that until the
issue really arose he feared to pass upon it. He felt himself stultified by this truth.

"I haven't spoken to her, Senator, because the time has not come, and just now she's too much
occupied elsewhere, perhaps. But all my hopes are fixed on her, sir, and when the time does
come, I trust you'll not oppose them."

Rexhill coughed to hide what his face might otherwise have shown.

"Well, Race," he said, with a choking sensation that was new to him, "you know what I think
of you. As for the rest, well, that will depend entirely upon Helen."

CHAPTER VI

MURDER

"How do you think you'd like to live in Crawling Water?"

Wade looked whimsically at Helen, as she picked her way with the grace of a kitten through
the dust of the main street. Carefully though she walked, her shoes and the bottom of her skirt
were covered with dust, and gray with it.

"I shouldn't like it," she said, with a little moue. "I don't see why you stay here. You aren't
going to always, are you?"

"I reckon it's likely."

"Not--for always?" She had stopped and was looking up into his face with delicious dismay.
"That would be awful."

"Most of my friends, and all of my business interests are here. Besides, I have a kind of pride
in growing up with this country. Back in the East, things have been settled for so long that
a man's only a cog in a machine. Out here, a fellow has a sense of ownership, even in the hills.
I think it's because he gets closer to the soil, until he comes to love it and to be almost
a part of it."

"Oh, dear!" exclaimed the girl. "That sounds fine, but the reality isn't up to my anticipation
of it."

Wade laughed in his hearty way.

"That's only because you haven't been here long enough, Helen."

"There are things that are splendid about the West," she generously admitted. "Its vastness
and wholesomeness, and especially its men. I'm sure that's why I first liked you, Gordon, because
you were different--not like the general run of young men in the East."

"Oh, there are lots of good men East, too."

"Not so very many. At least, I have seen very few who were at all worth while. There's one,
Maxwell Frayne, who has been plaguing me for months; but I don't care for him--much." She was
closely watching him as she spoke, and she smiled when he started.

"You'd better not."

"But if I really thought you meant to stay here all the time, I'm sure I'd love him devotedly.
Now"--she eyed him mischievously--"I think this would be a nice place to call home, don't you
know, just for fun, and then spend most of the time in New York and London. See that man staring
at me!"

"How, staring at you?"

Wade turned and looked in the direction she indicated, surprised at the suggestion that she
was being annoyed in Crawling Water, where chivalry to women ran high.

"Oh, he didn't mean anything, I daresay."

"They're friends of mine, and curious, perhaps." He referred to a group of cattlemen across
the street, who did seem to be staring and talking, with some indecision in their attitude.
"I wonder if anything can have happened? Oh, I guess not. Well, what would I do in London?"

"I didn't say anything about you being in London, did I?"

"Well, it's safe to say that where you were, I'd want to be, at any rate. Haven't I made two
trips to Chicago for no real reason except to see you?" he demanded, fast slipping into the
thralldom of her fascination.

She viewed him through half-closed eyes, knowing that the pose has always allured him.

"Don't you think you'd be kept busy looking after me?" she playfully asked. "Seriously, I hate
an idle man, but I don't know what you'd find to do there. What a question. You'd have to have
investments that would take you over every year or two."

"Now you're trying to make a city man of me," he said, half in jest. "Besides,"--a dogged note
crept into his voice--"I'd have the right to expect something of you, wouldn't I?"

"Not the right, but the privilege," she answered softly.

"This is where the Purnells live." He turned her into the pathway to the door. "This is what
I'd like, a neat little home like this, with a couple of kiddies and some dogs. Then I could
spend my out-door time at the ranch."

Before Helen could reply to this, Mrs. Purnell appeared on the threshold to welcome them, but
to Wade's surprise, she told them that Dorothy was not there.

"Oh, I'm so sorry," said Helen, with intense relief.

"I don't know where she went either," the mother went on. "She was out for a few minutes soon
after you left, Gordon. Then she came back and called out something to me, but I didn't catch
what she said. Before I knew what she was doing she had saddled her pony and ridden off. But
come right in. I don't think she'll be gone long."

They entered and Helen, graciously choosing to overlook the fact that this was evidently Wade's
second visit there within a very short time, sought to impress him with her tactfulness to
Mrs. Purnell. She would have been amazed could she have guessed that she was actually arousing
him to resentment. He felt, somehow, that she was patronizing their hostess, who was a woman
of refinement, even if she lacked the artificiality of manner that Helen affected. He was sincerely
glad when the visit came to an end.

"You must come again," said Mrs. Purnell, in a spirit of friendliness.

"So glad to have met you," Helen replied. "I hope to have the pleasure of meeting your daughter,
too, before we leave Crawling Water."

"They're splendid women, both of them," Wade remarked, as they walked back toward the center
of the town.

"Oh, yes," Helen agreed, without much spirit. "Nice, comfortable home people, I suppose."

"Best kind in the world."

"Gordon!" Helen laughed good-naturedly, facing him as she walked. "What in the world has been
the matter with you to-day? We usually get on so well together, and to-day, if I do say it,
only my unwillingness to quarrel has kept us from it."

"Oh, no!" He smiled, too. "Maybe that New York and London business rubbed me the wrong way;
that's all. I have plenty of faults, but I'm loyal to my friends. I don't like even hints that
they aren't the best friends a man could have."

"Surely, I haven't...."

"Maybe not. Maybe I imagined it. But Crawling Water is a lot more real than London, to my way
of thinking."

"You haven't been to London."

"I'm not likely to go, either," he retorted.

Her red lips curled in a way that seemed to indicate that she thought he would go. Already,
she was planning to get him out of Crawling Water and beyond the influence of Dorothy Purnell.

As they turned into the main street again, a man leaving a group near the livery stable, and
mounting a horse, rode toward them.

"I wonder what's up now?" Wade muttered, recognizing the horseman as one of the Trowbridge outfit.

"Mr. Wade. Just a minute." With the grace of a Centaur, the rider swung his mount in beside
them and doffed his hat. "Two of Jensen's herders have been shot. I thought you ought to know
about it."

"What?" The ranch owner's jaw dropped at the news.

"It's true, sir. Word just came in."

"Thanks, Barker." Wade pulled himself together, as the restless pony raced back to the barn.
"I must go, Helen," he went on, turning to the girl at his side. "There's been fighting--murder,
perhaps--out near the ranch. Santry will need me." He was uneasy lest the old plainsman should
have been concerned in the shooting.

"You'll take me to the hotel?"

"Of course, yes! Would you mind walking a little faster?" They quickened their pace. "I'm sorry,
Helen; but I must hurry to the ranch." Even at that moment he could not but reflect that there
would have been no need to take Dorothy home. Somehow, the ways of the East seemed to fit less
and less aptly into the life of Crawling Water.

On his way to the livery stable after his horse, Wade did some rapid thinking. Santry might
have been concerned in the shooting, but his employer thought not. The old fellow had promised
to stay at home, and his word was as good as another man's bond. It was too bad, certainly,
that the thing should have happened just when Senator Rexhill's promised aid had seemed in
a fair way to settle the controversy. Now, the whole thing was more upset than ever, for Moran
and Rexhill could hardly be blamed if they backed up their own men, especially if the herders
had been blameless, as was probably the case. Yet if the Senator did this, Wade knew that a
bloody little war would be the outcome.

"Where's Trowbridge, Barker?" he asked of the cowpuncher, whom he found waiting at the stable.

"At the ranch, I think."

Wade nodded. Ten minutes later he was in the saddle and headed for the mountains, just as dusk
began to fall. The cool night air, blowing against his face as he reached the higher levels,
was delightfully refreshing after the heat of the day. He took off his hat and opened the neck
of his shirt to the breeze, which revived his energies like wine. He knew that as he felt,
so his horse felt, and he was glad, for the animal would have to make a fast, hard trip. At
the crest of the first hills, before dipping into the valley, he turned for an instant in his
saddle to look backward over his trail toward the twinkling lights of Crawling Water in the
distance below.

He had covered some five miles of his journey, to no other sound than the occasional note of
some bird, when his quick ears caught the thud of a horse's feet on the trail ahead, with now
and then a sharp clatter as the animal slipped on the stones. Wade slowed his own horse down
to a walk, and eased his Colt in its holster. He expected to meet some harmless wayfarer, but,
under the circumstances, it was just as well to be prepared for trouble. Soon, however, he
smiled to himself, for whoever rode toward him made too much noise for any but a peaceful mission.
The other horse, too, had been slowed down and the two riders approached each other with such
caution that the rancher finally became impatient and pressed forward recklessly.

Out of the night the stranger came on, still slowly, until a turn in the trail brought them
face to face.

"Don't shoot!" said a woman's contralto. "I'm a friend."

"Dorothy!" Wade ejaculated, at once recognizing the voice, although he could not see the girl
distinctly in the darkness. "In Heaven's name, what are you doing out here?"

"Is it you, Gordon?" In her relief, she laughed softly as she pulled her pony up side of him.
"I was a little scared for a second or two. I've awfully bad news, I'm afraid," she added,
immediately serious. "I've been trying to find you. I went to the hotel and they told me you'd
gone somewhere."

"Miss Rexhill and I went to call on you."

"You did? If I'd only known. I've been clear out to the ranch."

"Is Santry there?" In his anxiety he forgot momentarily the loneliness of her long ride. "They
say some of Jensen's men have been shot up; and I'm anxious to find out what Bill knows."

"That's just what I want to tell you. I heard of the shooting before I left town. Whoa, Gypsy!"
She reined up her pony, nervously, for it would not stand still. Wade seized the animal's bridle
and quieted it. "I don't know if he's there or not," the girl went on. "I couldn't see. The
ranch house is full of men."

"Men? What men?" Wade demanded sharply.

"Race Moran's crowd. They went out to arrest Santry. The Sheriff is with them. I heard part
of it in town, and that's why I tried to find you." Wade groaned. "I peeped in at a window,
and when I could see neither you nor Santry I slipped away without being seen and took the
old trail back because it was shorter."

"Lord, what a mess!" Wade ground his teeth savagely. "Poor old Bill was all alone there and
they must have surprised him. But I don't see why Barker didn't mention the posse when he told
me of the shooting?"

"He didn't know of it, probably. They left town very quietly. I happened to be out back of
the house and I heard one of them talking as they rode by."

"Good Lord!" Wade's head drooped. "I told Bill to stay at the ranch, and he promised me...."

"I don't believe he shot Jensen at all," Dorothy declared, with spirit. "Yes, it was Jensen
himself and one of his herders. Both in the back--killed."

"Bill Santry never shot any man in the back," Wade declared, in a relieved tone. "If you're
sure of the facts, Santry will come clear all right."

"It's just a devilish scheme of Moran's, that's all, to put it on you and Santry. I'm sure
it is. He hates you both. Whoa, Gypsy!" She reined the little mare in again. "No, it's all
right, Gordon. I can manage her," she remonstrated, as he reached for the bridle once more.

"So that's their game, eh? By Heaven, I more than half believe you're right." His face grew
ugly with rage. "Dorothy," he continued grimly, "thanks are useless. You're a brick, that's
all. Do one thing more for us, will you?"

"Anything," she replied simply, her eyes shining with devotion to him, but he was too overwrought
to read them in the darkness.

"When you get back to town get word to some of the men for me. You may meet them on the way
out, if not they'll be around the barn. Tell them to meet me at the big pine, on the old trail."

His horse had grown restless and now he allowed it to have its head; he was moving past her
when she clutched his arm.

"Gordon!"

She loved him dearly, too dearly to let him know how well until he should speak, if he ever
did speak; but above them was the starlit sky and over them hovered the wondrous spirit of
the Western night. Her pulse was beating, too, to the call of danger, and despite the control
which she had over her nerves, she was just a bit hysterical beneath the surface. She knew
that ahead of him was a little army of hostile men, and already that day two men had been killed.
So, tremulously, she held on to his sleeve, until she stopped him.

"What are you going to do? You can't do anything alone against so many. They may kill you."

Her sympathy was very sweet to him and he warmly squeezed the little hand which had held him back.

"Don't you be afraid, little girl," he said tenderly. "I shall not get hurt if I can help it."

"Wait until the others come, won't you?"

"Surely," he answered readily, touched by the anxiety in her voice. "I'm going to look around--just
as you did--on the quiet. You wouldn't hold me back, where you went in, now would you?"

"No--!" She smiled a little into his face.

"That's the stuff! Then I'm coming back to the big pine, and you'll send the boys there. They'll
not put Santry in jail if we can prevent them. They've played their last card to-night. It's
war from now on."

"All right, Gordon, I'll go." Her voice was full of courage again; the moment of weakness had
passed. "Remember now, take good care of yourself."

"You bet," he retorted cheerily, and as her mare moved ahead, he caught her arm as she had
caught his. She went quite limp in her saddle and swayed toward him, but he merely added: "You're
a wonder, Dorothy."

He released her then, and with a wave of her hand she disappeared into the night. Not until
she was beyond recall did he realize that he might have kissed her; that she had wanted him
to kiss her, for the first time since they had known each other. He sat in abstraction for
several moments before he shook the reins in his hand and his horse sprang forward.

"I've kissed one girl to-day," he muttered aloud, "and I reckon that's enough."

CHAPTER VII

THE OLD TRAIL

For another mile Wade followed the main road and then diverged sharply to the left into what
was known as the old, or upper, trail. This had formerly been the valley road until made dangerous
by a wash-out a year or two previous. In the following spring the wash-out had been partially
repaired, but the going was still so rough that the new road was widened, and had been used
by preference ever since. The old trail, however, was nearly four miles the shorter of the
two, and was still traveled in cases of emergency, although to do so at speed and in the dark
was hazardous.

Wade's promise to Dorothy to take good care of himself had been made with mental reservation,
for, obsessed by his anxiety over Santry, the young ranchman was in no mood to spare either
himself or his horse. His going was marked by a constant shower of stones, sometimes behind
him, as the wiry cayuse climbed like a mountain goat; but as often in front, as horse and rider
coasted perilously down some declivity. The horse sweated and trembled with nervousness, as
a frightened child might, but never refused to attempt what its master demanded of it. One
might almost say that there existed a human understanding between man and beast as to the importance
of their errand; a common impulse, which urged them onward.

When Wade reflected that Dorothy, too, had come over that trail by night in his interest, he
thought her more than ever a wonderful girl. Even to one born and raised in the cattle country,
the trip would have been difficult; but then he realized that Dorothy seemed much like a ranch-bred
girl in her courage and frank womanliness, nor was she any less charming on that account. After
all, he thought, women paid too highly for little accomplishments, if to gain them they had
to sacrifice the vital points of character. He could not help but contrast Helen's insistence
that she should be escorted back to the hotel with Dorothy's brave ride alone, and while he
was too loyal to Helen Rexhill to blame her in this respect, the thing made a deep impression
upon him.

The way was long, and he had time for many thoughts. It was natural, in the still night, with
Dorothy only a little while gone, that he should think tenderly of her, for this cost Santry
nothing. For Santry, Wade was reserving not thought but action. He was making up his mind that
if Moran had taken the foreman into custody on a trumped up charge of murder, the agent should
feel the power of a greater tribunal than any court in the locality--the law of the Strong
Arm! Behind him in this, the ranchman knew, was the whole of the cattle faction, and since
war had been thrust upon them he would not stop until the end came, whatever it might be. His
conscience was clean, for he had exerted himself manfully in the cause of peace, even to the
point where his own character had suffered, and now the hour of reprisal was at hand.

He rode, at last, over the top of the Divide and into the little draw that led up to the ranch
buildings, in the windows of which lights gleamed. With an imprecation at sight of them, he
tied his horse to a post, and, revolver in hand, crept toward the house as quietly as a Sioux.

Except for the light, there was no sign of life about the place, and Wade craftily advanced
into the deeper shadows close to the wall of the house. Taking off his hat, so that the crown
might not betray him, he peeped through a window. What he saw made him clinch his fingers and
grit his teeth in rage.

Inside were half a dozen men, besides three of his own ranch hands who lay trussed up like
turkeys in one corner of the room; doubtless they had been surprised by the posse before they
had opportunity to run or put up a fight. Moran was there, stretched comfortably on Wade's
own cot, smoking a cigar. Once, he looked directly toward the window at which the watcher had
placed himself, but the latter did not move. Instead, he fingered his gun and waited; he was
not sure that he really wanted to avoid detection; if it came, Moran would pay, and the rest,
at the moment, did not seem to matter. He had forgotten Dorothy entirely.

But Santry was not there and this fact puzzled Wade. The Sheriff was not there either, and
presently it occurred to the cattleman that a part of the posse, with Santry, might have returned
to Crawling Water over the main trail. Probably Moran, with the rest, was waiting for him.
The mere thought of Santry already on his way to jail filled Wade with a baffling sense of
rage, and creeping from the house, he examined the surrounding turf by the faint rays of the
moon. It was badly cut up by the feet of many horses, and several minutes passed before Wade
was really sure that a number of mounted men had taken the trail back to town. Satisfied of
this at length, he untied his horse and swung into the saddle.

Before riding away he considered the advisability of driving off the horses belonging to Moran's
party, but there would still be others in the corral, and besides their absence, when discovered,
would give warning of the impending attack. On second thought, however, he quietly made his
way to the corral and caught a fresh horse of his own. When he had saddled it he set out over
the old trail for the big pine.

When he reached the rendezvous his men were not there; but knowing that he must meet them if
he followed the road from there on he did not stop. He came upon them in a few minutes, riding
toward him at full speed, with Tim Sullivan in the van, too drunk to stand erect, but able
to balance himself on a horse's back, drunk or sober.

"We come acrost Santry and the Sheriff a while back," explained Big Bob Lawson, one of Wade's
own punchers. "They must be in town by now. We was aimin' to light into 'em, but Santry wouldn't
hear of it. Course, we took our orders from him same as usual. He said to tell you that you
wanted him to keep quiet, an' that's what he aimed to do."

"He said we wasn't to tell you that he didn't shoot them Swedes," put in another of the men.

"What?" Wade demanded sharply.

"He said--hic!" broke in Tim Sullivan, with drunken gravity. "He said--hic!--that if you didn't
know that without--hic!--bein' told, you wasn't no friend of his'n, an'--hic!--you could go
to hell."

"Shut up, you drunken fool!" Lawson snapped out.

"Jensen and his herder were shot in the back, they say. That clears Santry," Wade declared,
and sat for some moments in deep thought, while the men waited as patiently as they could.
"Lawson," he said, at last. "You're in charge for the present. Take the boys to the big pine
and camp there quietly until I come back. I'm going into town."

"Hadn't you better take us with you, boss? We'll stick. We're for you an' Bill Santry an' ag'in'
these--sheepherders, whenever you say the word."

"That's--hic--what we are!" Sullivan hiccoughed.

Wade shook his head.

"No. You wait for me at the pine. You'll have to rustle your grub the best way you can. I may
not get back until to-morrow--until this evening--it's morning now. But wait until I come.
There will be plenty for you to do later on and there is no use of you going back to town with
me. It might get you into worse trouble than you're headed for already, and what I've got to
do, I can do alone."

Wheeling his horse, he rode off toward Crawling Water.

That he could take his men with him, storm the jail and release Santry, Wade did not doubt,
but to do so would be to bring each of the men into open conflict with the law, a responsibility
which he was resolved to bear alone. Then, too, because his long ride had cooled him somewhat,
he intended to make one more appeal to the Senator. Possibly, Moran had exceeded his instructions,
and if this were so, it was no more than just that Rexhill, who had seemed to evince a willingness
to be helpful, should have the opportunity to disown the act of his agent. Besides, if Santry
could be peaceably released, he would be freed of the charge hanging over him, which would
not be the case if he were taken from the jail by strategy or violence.

       *       *       *       *       *

With haggard countenance and inflamed eyes, Wade bore little resemblance to his normal self
when he again appeared before the Senator, who received him in his dressing-gown, being just
out of bed. Rexhill listened with a show of sympathy to the cattleman's story, but evidently
he was in a different mood from the day before.

"My boy, your friendship for your foreman is leading you astray. Your faith in him, which is
natural and does you credit, is blinding you to an impartial view of the case. Why not let
the law take its course? If Santry is innocent his trial will prove it. At any rate, what can
I do?"

"Senator--" Wade spoke with intense weariness. "Only yesterday you offered to help us. The
situation, as I explained it then, is unchanged now, except for the worse. Bill Santry is free
of any complicity in Jensen's death. I am positive of it. He sent me word that he had not left
the ranch, and he would not lie to save himself from hanging. Besides, the men were shot in
the back, and that is absolute proof that Santry didn't do it."

"Mere sentiment, Gordon; mere sentiment. Proof? Pooh!"

Rexhill's slightly contemptuous tone worked upon Wade in his exhausted, overwrought condition,
and stung him. A strange look of cunning appeared in his eyes, as he leaned across the table
which separated them.

"Senator, Moran made me an offer the other day for my land. If--I accept that offer, will you
exert your influence in Santry's behalf?"

Coming so swiftly upon his planning, the prospect of such signal success was so gratifying
to Rexhill that only in halting speech could he maintain a show of decorous restraint. His
countenance expressed exultant relief, as well it might, since he seemed to see himself snatched
out of the jaws of ruin.

"Why, Gordon, I--Of course, my boy, if you were to show such a generous spirit as that, I--er--should
feel bound...." The sense of his remarks was lost in the crash of Wade's fist upon the table.

"Damn you!" The cattleman was beyond himself with fatigue, rage, and a rankling sense of injustice.
"They told me that was your game. I believed it of Moran, but I thought you were square. So
you're that sort, too, eh? Well, may you rot in hell before you get my land, you robber! Now
listen to me." He waved his hand in the direction of the street. "Out there's a hundred men--real
men--who're waiting the word to run you out of this country, you and Moran, too, and by God
we'll do it--we'll do it--and we'll begin right away!" Again his heavy fist crashed down on
the table "Never mind Bill Santry"--the instinct of discretion was gaining in Wade.--"He can
stay where he is for the present. First, we'll attend to you pirates--then we'll see."

He stopped suddenly at sight of Helen, who attracted by the noise, had entered the room, and
stood before him in a filmy negligee.

"What is the matter, Gordon?" she demanded anxiously.

"I beg your pardon." Wade spoke awkwardly, unashamed of himself, except for her. "I'm worn
out and I--I lost my temper."

"Will you--er--leave this room!" The Senator was beginning to pull himself together. It was
the first time he had ever been ragged in such a way, and his composure had suffered; he spoke
now with more than his usual pomposity.

"I will," Wade answered curtly, as he turned on his heel and departed.

The Senator, puffing slightly, fiddled with his glasses.

"Your young friend has seen fit to accuse me of--of--" For the life of him, he could not at
once say of just what he had been accused, unless he allowed self-accusation to prompt his
words. "Some sheepherders have been murdered, I believe," he went on, "and Wade seems to think
that Moran and I are implicated."

"You!" his daughter exclaimed; evidently her amazement did not extend to Moran.

"Preposterous nonsense!"

"Yes, of course." Helen walked to the window and stood looking down into the street. "I'm afraid
Gordon hasn't improved since we saw him last," she added, finally. "He seems quite a different
person from the man I used to know. What are you going to do about it?"

"Crush him!" The Senator's lips set in a thin, white line, as his hand descended on the table
on the spot where Wade's fist had fallen. "This, apparently, is his gratitude to me for my
interest in him. Now I intend to show him the other side of me."

"Certainly, no one could blame you for punishing him. Oh, everything between him and me is
quite over," said the girl, with a peculiar smile. "He's a perfect bear."

"I'm glad you feel that way about it, Helen." Her father's set lips relaxed into a responsive
smile. "You couldn't be my daughter and not have some sense."

"Have I any?" Helen naïvely asked.

She was gazing out of the window again, and to her mind's eye the dusty, squalid street became
a broad highway, with jewelers' shops on either side, and modistes, and other such charming
things, just as they are found in New York, or--Paris!

CHAPTER VIII

HIGHER THAN STATUTE LAW

Wade descended the stairs of the hotel and went into the barroom, fuming with rage and chagrin
because Helen had seen him in such a temper. Like most men of action, he took pride in his
self-control, which seldom failed him, but the villainy of the Senator's attitude had momentarily
mastered his patience.

Gathered about the bar were a number of men whom he knew, but beyond a nod here and there he
took no notice of them, and went to sit down alone at a small table in the corner. His friends
respected his desire to be left alone, although several eyed him curiously and exchanged significant
remarks at his appearance. They seemed to be of the opinion that, at last, his fighting blood
had been aroused, and now and then they shot approving glances in his direction.

"Whiskey," Wade called to the bartender, and a bottle and glass were placed on the table in
front of him.

With a steady hand the ranchman poured out and quickly swallowed two stiff drinks of the fiery
liquor, although he was not ordinarily a drinking man. The fact that he drank now showed his
mental state more clearly than words could have expressed it. Searching in his pockets, he
found tobacco and papers and rolled and lighted a cigarette. Nothing could be done for Santry
until night, and meanwhile he intended to get something to eat and take the sleep that he needed
to fit himself for the task ahead of him. He ordered a steak, which on top of the whiskey put
new life into him.

The more he thought of his outburst of temper before Helen the more it annoyed him, for he
realized that he had "bitten off a bigger wad than he could chew," as Bill Santry would have
expressed it. Rascal though the Senator was, so far as he was concerned, Wade felt that his
hands were tied on Helen's account. For her sake, he could not move against her father in a
country where the average man thought of consequences after the act rather than before it.
In a sense Wade felt that he stood sponsor for Crawling Water in the hospitality which it offered
Helen, and he could not bring peril down on her head.

But as for Moran and his hirelings, that was a different matter! When the ranchman thought
of Moran, no vengeance seemed too dire to fit his misdeeds. In that direction he would go to
the limit, and he only hoped that he might get his hands on Moran in the mix-up. He still looked
upon his final visit to Rexhill as a weakness, but it had been undertaken solely on Santry's
account. It had failed, and no one now could expect tolerance of him except Helen. If the posse
was still at the ranch, when he and Santry returned there at the head of their men, they would
attack in force, and shoot to kill if necessary.

He learned from Lem Trowbridge, who presently joined him at the table, that the posse would
probably still be there, for the report in town was that Moran had taken possession of the
property and meant to stay there.

"He does, eh?" Wade muttered grimly. "Well, he may, but it will be with his toes up. I'm done,
Lem. By Heaven, it's more than flesh and blood can stand!"

"It sure is! We're with you, Gordon. Your men were over at my place a few hours ago. We grubbed
them and loaned them all the guns we could spare. I sent over my new Winchester and a belt
of shells for you."

"Thanks."

"That's all right. You're more than welcome to all the help I can give you, not only against
Moran and his gang, but against Rexhill. If you like, we'll run him out of town while you're
putting the fear of God into Moran. Lord! I sure would like to go back to the ranch with you,
but it's your own quarrel and I won't butt in."

Wade briefly explained his attitude toward the Rexhills and added that their cause would not
be helped by violence toward the Senator, who was a big man at Washington, and might stir the
authorities into action on his behalf if he could prove personal abuse. The noise that would
be made by such a happening might drown out the justice of the cattlemen's claim.

"Well, that's true, too," Trowbridge admitted. "I can see the point all right. What we want
to do is to get something 'on' the Senator. I mean something sure--something like this Jensen
shooting."

Wade nodded slowly.

"That's the idea, but I'm afraid we can't do it, Lem. I haven't a doubt but that Moran is mixed
up in the killing, but I hardly believe Rexhill is. Anyhow, they've probably covered their
tracks so well that we'll never be able to connect them with it."

"Oh, I don't know. You can't always tell what time'll bring to light." Trowbridge lowered his
voice. "What's your idea about Santry? Do you want help there?"

"No." Wade spoke with equal caution. "I believe I can manage all right alone. The Sheriff will
probably be looking for us to rush the jail, but he won't expect me to come alone. Bat Lewis
goes on duty as the relief, about nine o'clock. I mean to beat him to it, and if the Sheriff
opens up for me I'll be away with Santry before Bat appears. But I must get some sleep, Lem."

The two men arose.

"Well, good luck to you, Gordon." Trowbridge slapped his friend on the shoulder, and they separated.

"Frank, can you let me have a bed?" Wade asked of the hotel proprietor, a freckled Irishman.

"Sure; as many as you want."

"One will do, Frank; and another thing," the ranchman said guardedly. "I'll need an extra horse
to-night, and I don't want to be seen with him until I need him. Can you have him tied behind
the school-house a little before nine o'clock?"

"You bet I can!" The Irishman slowly dropped an eyelid, for the school-house was close by the jail.

Wade tumbled into the bed provided for him and slept like a log, having that happy faculty
of the healthy man, of being able to sleep when his body needed it, no matter what impended
against the hour of awakening.

When he did wake up, the afternoon was well advanced, and after another hearty meal he walked
over to the Purnells' to pass the time until it was late enough for him to get to work.

"Now, Gordon will tell you I'm right," Mrs. Purnell proclaimed triumphantly, when the young
man entered the cottage. "I want Dorothy to go with me to call on Miss Rexhill, and she doesn't
want to go. The idea! When Miss Rexhill was nice enough to call on us first."

Mrs. Purnell set much store upon her manners, as the little Michigan town where she was born
understood good breeding, and she had not been at all annoyed by Helen Rexhill's patronage,
which had so displeased Wade. To her mind the Rexhills were very great people, and great people
were to be expected to bear themselves in lofty fashion. Dorothy had inherited her democracy
from her father and not from her mother, who, indeed, would have been disappointed if Helen
Rexhill appeared any less than the exalted personage she imagined herself to be.

"Oh, I'd like to meet her well enough, only...." Dorothy stopped, unwilling to say before Wade
that she did not consider the Rexhills sufficiently good friends of his, in the light of recent
developments, for them to be friends of hers.

"Of course, go," he broke in heartily. "She's not responsible for what her father does in the
way of business, and I reckon she'd think it funny if you didn't call."

"There now!" Mrs. Purnell exclaimed triumphantly.

"All right, I'll go." In her heart Dorothy was curious to meet the other woman and gauge her
powers of attraction. "We'll go to-morrow, mother."

Quite satisfied, Mrs. Purnell made some excuse to leave them together, as she usually did,
for her mother heart had traveled farther along the Road to To-morrow than her daughter's fancy.
She secretly hoped that the young cattleman would some day declare his love for Dorothy and
ask for her hand in marriage.

In reply to the girl's anxious questions Wade told her of what had happened since their meeting
on the trail, as they sat together on the porch of the little cottage. She was wearing a plain
dress of green gingham, which, somehow, suggested to him the freshness of lettuce. She laughed
a little when he told her of that and called him foolish, though the smile that showed a dimple
in her chin belied her words.

"Then the posse is still at the ranch?" she asked.

"I think so. If they are, we are going to run them off to-morrow morning, or perhaps to-night.
I've had enough of this nonsense and I mean to meet Moran halfway from now on."

"Yes, I suppose you must," she admitted reluctantly. "But do be careful, Gordon."

"As careful as I can be under the circumstances," he said cheerfully, and told her that his
chief purpose in coming to see her was to thank her again for the service she had rendered him.

"Oh, you don't need to thank me for that. Do you know"--she puckered up her brows in a reflective
way--"I've been thinking. It seems very strange to me that Senator Rexhill and Moran should
be willing to go to such lengths merely to get hold of this land as a speculation. Doesn't
it seem so to you?"

"Yes, it does, but that must be their reason."

"I'm not so sure of that, Gordon. There must be something more behind all this. That's what
I have been thinking about. You remember that when Moran first came here he had an office just
across the street from his present one?"

"Yes. Simon Barsdale had Moran's present office until he moved to Sheridan. You were his stenographer
for a while, I remember." Wade looked at her curiously, wondering what she was driving at.

"Moran bought Mr. Barsdale's safe." Her voice sounded strange and unnatural. "I know the old
combination. I wonder if it has been changed?"

"Lem Trowbridge was saying only this morning," said Wade thoughtfully, for he was beginning
to catch her meaning, "that if we could only get proof of something crooked we might...."

"Well, I think we can," Dorothy interrupted.

They looked searchingly at each other in the gathering dusk, and he tried to read the light
in her eyes, and being strangely affected himself by their close proximity, he misinterpreted
it. He slipped his hand over hers and once more the desire to kiss her seized him. He let go
of her hand and was just putting his arm around her shoulders when, to his surprise, she appeared
suddenly indignant.

"Don't!"

He was abashed, and for a moment neither said a word.

"What is the combination?" he finally asked hoarsely.

"I promised Mr. Barsdale never to tell any one." Her lips wreathed into a little smile. "I'll
do it myself."

"No, you won't." Wade shook his head positively. "Do you suppose I'm going to let you steal
for me? It will be bad enough to do it myself; but necessity knows no law. Well, we'll let
it go for the present then. Don't you think of doing it, Dorothy. Will you promise me?"

"I never promise," she said, smiling again, and ignoring her last words in womanly fashion,
"but if you don't want me to...."

"Well, I don't," he declared firmly. "Let it rest at that. We'll probably find some other way
anyhow."

She asked him then about Santry, but he evaded a direct answer beyond expressing the conviction
that everything would end all right. They talked for a while of commonplaces, although nothing
that he said seemed commonplace to her and nothing that she said seemed so to him. When it
was fully dark he arose to go. Then she seemed a little sorry that she had not let him put
his arm around her, and she leaned toward him as she had done on the trail; but he was not
well versed in woman's subtleties, and he failed to guess her thoughts and walked away, leaving
her, as Shakespeare put it, to

          "Twice desire, ere it be day,
          That which with scorn she put away."

Having mounted his horse at the livery stable, he first made sure that the extra horse was
behind the school-house, where he tied his own, and then walked around to the jail. On the
outside, this building was a substantial log structure; within, it was divided into the Sheriff's
office and sleeping room, the "bull pen," and a single narrow cell, in which Wade guessed that
Santry would be locked. After examining his revolver, he slipped it into the side pocket of
his coat and walked boldly up to the jail. Then, whistling merrily, for Bat Lewis, the deputy,
was a confirmed human song-bird, he knocked sharply on the door with his knuckles.

"It's me--Bat," he called out, mimicking Lewis' voice, in answer to a question from within.

"You're early to-night. What's struck you?" Sheriff Thomas opened the door, and turning, left
it so, for the "relief" to enter. He had half feared that an attempt might be made to liberate
Santry, but had never dreamed that any one would try the thing alone. He was glad to be relieved,
for a poker game at which he wanted to sit in would soon start at the Gulch Saloon.

He was the most surprised man in Wyoming, when he felt the cold muzzle of Wade's Colt boring
into the nape of his neck and heard the ranchman's stern warning to keep quiet or take the
consequences. Sheriff Thomas had earned his right to his "star" by more than one exhibition
of nerve, but he was too familiar with gun ethics to argue with the business end of a "45."

"Not a sound!" Outwardly cold as ice, but inwardly afire, Wade shoved the weapon against his
victim's neck and marched him to the middle of the room. "I've got the upper hand, Sheriff,
and I intend to keep it."

"You're a damn fool, Wade." The Sheriff spoke without visible emotion and in a low tone. "You'll
go up for this. Don't you realize that...."

"Can it!" snapped Wade, deftly disarming the officer with his free hand. "Never mind the majesty
of the law and all that rot. I thought that all over before I came. Now that I've got you and
drawn your teeth, you'll take orders from me. Get my foreman out of that cell and be quick
about it!"

There was nothing to do but obey, which Thomas quietly did, although somewhat in fear of what
Santry might do when at liberty. When the cell door was unlocked, the old plainsman, in a towering
rage at the injustice of his incarceration, seemed inclined to choke his erstwhile jailer.

"None of that, Bill," Wade admonished curtly. "He's only been a tool in this business, although
he ought to know better. We'll tie him up and gag him; that's all. Rip up one of those blankets."

"I knew you'd come, boy!" The foreman's joy was almost like that of a big dog at sight of his
master. "By the great horned toad, I knew it!" With his sinewy hands he tore the blanket into
strips as easily as though the wool had been paper. "Now for him, drat him!"

Wade stood guard while the helpless Sheriff was trussed up and his mouth stopped by Santry,
and if the ranch owner felt any compunction at the sight, he had only to think of his own men
as he had seen them the night before, lying on the floor of the ranch house.

"Make a good job of it, Bill," was his only comment.

"You bet!" Santry chuckled as he drew the last of the knots tight. "That'll hold him for a
spell, I reckon. How you feel, Sheruff, purty comfortable?" The flowing end of the gag so hid
the officer's features that he could express himself only with his eyes, which he batted furiously.
"Course," Santry went on, in mock solicitude, "if I'd thought I mighta put a bit of sugar on
that there gag, to remind you of your mammy like, but it ain't no great matter. You can put
a double dose in your cawfee when you git loose."

"Come on, Bill!" Wade commanded.

"So long, Sheruff," Santry chuckled.

There was no time to waste in loitering, for at any moment Bat Lewis might arrive and give
an alarm which would summon reënforcements from amongst Moran's following. Hurrying Santry
ahead of him, Wade swung open the door and they looked out cautiously. No one was in sight,
and a couple of minutes later the two men were mounted and on their way out of town.

"By the great horned toad!" Santry exulted, as they left the lights of Crawling Water behind
them. "It sure feels good to be out of that there boardin'-house. It wasn't our fault, Gordon,
and say, about this here shootin'...."

"I know all about that, Bill," Wade interposed. "The boys told me. They're waiting for us at
the big pine. But your arrest, that's what I want to hear about."

"Well, it was this-a-way," the old man explained. "They sneaked up on the house in the dark
and got the drop on us. Right here I rise to remark that never no more will I separate myself
from my six-shooter. More'n one good man has got hisself killed just because his gun wasn't
where it oughter be when he needed it. Of course, we put up the best scrap we could, but we
didn't have no chance, Gordon. The first thing I knew, while I was tusslin' with one feller,
somebody fetched me a rap on the head with a pistol-butt, an' I went down for the count. Any
of the boys shot up?"

Wade described the appearance of the ranch house on the previous night, and Santry swore right
manfully.

"What's on the cards now?" he demanded. "How much longer are we goin' to stand for...."

"No longer," Wade declared crisply. "That's why the boys are waiting for us at the pine. We're
going to run Moran and his gang off the ranch as soon as we can get there, and then we're going
to run them out of the country."

"Whoop-e-e-e-e-e!" The old plainsman's yell of exultation split the night like the yelp of
a coyote, and he brought his hand down on Wade's back with a force which made the latter wince.
"By the great horned toad, that's talkin! That's the finest news I've heard since my old mammy
said to the parson, 'Call him Bill, for short.' Whoop-e-e-e-e!"

Wade's warning to keep still was lost on the wind, for Santry stuck his spurs into his horse's
flanks and charged along the trail like an old-time knight. With a grim smile his employer
put on speed and followed him.

CHAPTER IX

THE BATTLE AT THE RANCH

When Wade and Santry approached the big pine, the waiting men came out from its shadow and
rode forward, with the borrowed rifles across their saddle horns.

"All right, boys?" the rancher asked, taking Trowbridge's new rifle, a beautiful weapon, which
Lawson handed to him.

"All right, sir," answered Tim Sullivan, adding the "sir" in extenuation of his befuddled condition
the night before, while each man gave Santry a silent hand-shake to welcome him home.

Grimly, silently, then, save for the dashing of their horses' hoofs against the loose stones,
and an occasional muttered imprecation as a rider lurched in his saddle, the seven men rode
rapidly toward the mountains. In numbers, their party was about evenly matched with the enemy,
and Wade meant that the advantage of surprise, if possible, should rest with him in order to
offset such advantage as Moran might find in the shelter of the house. But, however that might
be, each man realized that the die had been cast and that the fight, once begun, would go to
a finish.

"I only hope," Santry remarked, as a steep grade forced them to lessen their speed, "I can
get my two hands on that cussed tin-horn, Moran. Him and me has a misunderstandin' to settle,
for sure."

"You leave him to me, Bill." Wade spoke vindictively. "He's my meat."

"Well, since you ask it, I'll try, boy. But there's goin' to be some fightin' sure as taxes,
and when I get to fightin', I'm liable to go plumb, hog wild. Say, I hope you don't get into
no trouble over this here jail business o' mine. That 'ud make me feel bad, Gordon."

"We'll not worry about that now, Bill."

"That's right. Don't worry till you have to, and then shoot instead. That's been my motto all
my born days, and it ain't such durn bad philosophy at that. I wonder"--the old man chuckled
to himself--"I wonder if the Sheruff et up most of that there gag before Bat let him loose?"

Wade laughed out loud, and as though in response, an owl hooted somewhere in the timber to
their right.

"There's a durned old hoot owl," growled Santry. "I never like to hear them things--they most
always mean bad luck."

He rode to the head of the little column, and the rest of the way to the ranch was passed in
ominous silence. When they finally arrived at the edge of the clearing and cautiously dismounted,
everything seemed from the exterior, at least, just as it should be. The night being far gone,
the lights were out, and there was no sign of life about the place. Wade wondered if the posse
had gone.

"There ain't no use in speculatin'," declared Santry. "They may be asleep, and they may be
layin' for us there in the dark. This will take a rise out of 'em anyhow."

At sight of the old fellow, pistol in hand, Wade called to him to wait, but as he spoke Santry
fired two quick shots into the air.

There was an immediate commotion in the ranch house. A man inside was heard to curse loudly,
while another showed his face for an instant where the moonlight fell across a window. He hastily
ducked out of sight, however, when a rifle bullet splintered the glass just above his head.
Presently a gun cracked inside the house and a splash on a rock behind the attackers told them
where the shot had struck.

"Whoop-e-e-e-e!" Santry yelled, discharging the four remaining shots in his revolver at the
window. "We've got 'em guessin'. They don't know how many we are."

"They were probably asleep," said Wade a bit sharply. "We might have sneaked in and captured
the whole crowd without firing a shot. That's what I meant to do before you cut loose."

Santry shook his grizzled head as he loaded his revolver.

"Well, now, that would have been just a mite risky, boy. The way things stand we've still got
the advantage, an'...." He broke off to take a snapshot at a man who showed himself at the
window for an instant in an effort to get a glimpse of the attacking force. "One!" muttered
the old plainsman to himself.

By this time Wade had thrown himself down on his stomach behind a bowlder to Santry's left
and was shooting methodically at the door of the house, directly in front of him. He knew that
door. It was built of inch lumber and was so located that a bullet, after passing through it,
would rake the interior of the cabin from end to end. The only way the inmates could keep out
of the line of his fire was by hugging the walls on either side, where they would be partially
exposed to the leaden hail which Santry and the punchers were directing at the windows.

There was a grim, baleful look on the young man's usually pleasant face, and his eyes held
a pitiless gleam. He was shooting straight, shooting to kill, and taking a fierce delight in
the act. The blood lust was upon him, that primal, instinctive desire for combat in a righteous
cause that lies hidden at the very bottom of every strong man's nature. And there came to his
mind no possible question of the righteous nature of his cause. He was fighting to regain possession
of his own home from the marauders who had invaded it. His enemies had crowded him to the wall,
and now they were paying the penalty. Wade worked the lever of his Winchester as though he
had no other business in life. A streak of yellow clay mingled with a bloody trickle from a
bullet scratch on his cheek gave his set features a fairly ferocious expression.

Santry, glancing toward him, chuckled again, but without mirth. "The boy's woke up at last,"
he muttered to himself. "They've drove him to it, durn 'em. I knew almighty well that this
law an' order stunt couldn't last forever. Wow!"

The latter exclamation was caused by a bullet which ricocheted from a rock near his head, driving
a quantity of fine particles into his face.

"Whoop-e-e-e-e!" he howled a moment later. "We got 'em goin'. It's a cinch they can't stand
this pace for more'n a week."

Indeed, it was a marvel that the defenders kept on fighting as long as they did. Already the
door, beneath Wade's machine-like shooting, had been completely riddled; the windows were almost
bare of glass; and great splinters of wood had been torn from the log walls by the heavy rifle
bullets on their way through to the interior. Soon the door sagged and crashed inward, and
into the gaping hole thus made Wade continued to empty his rifle.

At last, the fire of those within slackened and temporarily ceased. Did this mean surrender?
Wade asked himself and ordered his men to stop shooting and await developments. For some moments
all was still, and the advisability of rushing the house was being discussed when all at once
the fire of the defenders began again. This time, however, there was something very odd about
it. There was a loud banging of exploding cartridges, but only a few shots whistled around
the heads of the cattlemen. Nevertheless, Wade told his men to resume shooting, and once more
settled down to his own task.

"What'n hell they tryin' to do?" Santry demanded. "Sounds like a Fourth o' July barbecue to me."

"I don't know," Wade answered, charging the magazine of his rifle, "but whatever it is they'll
have to stop mighty soon."

Then gradually, but none the less certainly, the fire from within slackened until all was still.
This seemed more like a visitation of death, and again Wade ordered his men to stop shooting.
They obeyed orders and lay still, keenly watching the house.

"Do you surrender?" Wade shouted; but there was no reply.

Santry sprang to his feet.

"By the great horned toad!" he cried. "I'm a-goin' in there! Anybody that wants to come along
is welcome."

Not a man in the party would be dared in that way, so, taking advantage of such cover as offered,
they advanced upon the cabin, stealthily at first and then more rapidly, as they met with no
resistance--no sign whatever of life. A final rush carried them through the doorway into the
house, where they expected to find a shambles.

Wade struck a light, and faced about with a start as a low groan came from a corner of the
back room. A man lay at full length on the floor, tied hand and foot, and gagged. It was Ed
Nelson, one of the Double Arrow hands who had been surprised and captured by the posse, and
a little farther away in the shadow against the wall his two companions lay in a like condition.
With his knife Wade was cutting them loose, and glancing about in a puzzled search for the
wounded men he expected to find in the house, when Santry shouted something from the kitchen.

"What is it, Bill?" the ranch owner demanded.

Santry tramped back into the room, laughing in a shamefaced sort of way.

"They done us, Gordon!" he burst out. "By the great horned toad, they done us! They chucked
a bunch of shells into the hot cook-stove, an' sneaked out the side door while we was shootin'
into the front room. By cracky, that beats...."

"That's what they did," spoke up Nelson, as well as his cramped tongue would permit, being
now freed of the gag. "They gagged us first, so's we couldn't sing out; then they filled up
the stove an' beat it."

What had promised to be a tragedy had proved a fiasco, and Wade smiled a little foolishly.

"The joke's on us, I guess, boys," he admitted. "But we've got the ranch back, at any rate.
How are you feeling, Ed, pretty stiff and sore?"

"My Gawd, yes--awful!"

"Me, too," declared Tom Parrish, the second of the victims; and the third man swore roundly
that he would not regain the full use of his legs before Christmas.

"Well, you're lucky at that," was Santry's dry comment. "All that saved you from gettin' shot
up some in the fight was layin' low down in that corner where you was." He let his eyes travel
around the littered, blood-spattered room. "From the looks o' this shebang we musta stung some
of 'em pretty deep; but nobody was killed, I reckon. I hope Moran was the worst hurt, durn him!"

"He'll keep," Wade said grimly. "We've not done with him yet, Bill. We've only just begun."

CHAPTER X

THE SENATOR GETS BUSY

It was daylight when the routed posse, with Race Moran in the lead, his left arm tied up in
a blood-stained handkerchief, rode into Crawling Water. A bullet had pierced the fleshy part
of the agent's wrist, a trifling wound, but one which gave him more pain than he might have
suffered from a serious injury. None of the members of the posse had been dangerously wounded;
indeed, they had suffered more in the spirit than in the flesh; but there had been a number
of minor casualties amongst the men, which made a sufficiently bloody display to arouse the
little town to active curiosity.

Under instructions from the leader, however, the fugitives kept grouchily silent, so that curiosity
was able to feed only on speculations as to Wade's temper, and the fact that he had brought
about Santry's release from jail. The story of that achievement had been bruited about Crawling
Water since midnight, together with the probability that the Law would be invoked to punish
the ranchman for his defiance of it. Popular sentiment was running high over the likelihood
of such a step being taken, and the members of the posse were the targets of many hostile glances
from the townspeople. At least two-thirds of the citizens were strongly in favor of Wade, but
before they took active steps in his behalf they waited for the return of a horseman, who had
hurried out to the ranch to learn at first hand exactly what had happened there.

Meanwhile Moran, in an ugly mood, had awakened the Senator from the troubled sleep which had
come to him after much wakeful tossing. Rexhill, with tousled hair, wrapped in a bathrobe,
from the bottom of which his bare ankles and slippered feet protruded, sat on the edge of his
bed, impatiently chewing an unlighted cigar while he listened to Moran's account of the fracas.

"You went too far, Race,--you went too far," he burst out angrily at last. "You had no orders
to jump the ranch. I told you...."

"We've been fooling around long enough, Senator," Moran interrupted sullenly, nursing his throbbing
wrist. "It was high time somebody started something, and when I saw my chance I seized it.
You seem to think"--his voice trailed into scorn--"that we are playing marbles with boys, but,
I tell you, it's men we're up against. My experience has shown me that it's the first blow
that counts in any fight."

"Well, who got in the hardest lick, eh?" Rexhill snorted sarcastically. "The first blow's all
right, provided the second isn't a knockout from the other side. Why, confound it, Race, here
we had Wade at our mercy. He'd broken into jail and set free a suspected murderer--a clear
case of criminality. Then you had to spoil it all."

Moran smothered an imprecation.

"You seem to forget, Senator, that we had him at our mercy before, and you wouldn't hear of
it. If you'd taken my advice in the first place, we'd have had Wade in jail instead of Santry
and things might have been different."

"Your advice was worthless under the circumstances; that's why I didn't take it." Rexhill deliberately
paused and lighted his cigar, from which he took several soothing puffs. To have been aroused
from his bed with such news had flustered him somewhat; but he had never known anything worth
while to come out of a heated discussion, and he sought now to calm himself. Finally, he spoke
slowly. "What you proposed to me then was a frame-up, and all frame-ups are dangerous, particularly
when they have little to rest upon. For that reason I refused to fall in with your ideas, Race.
This release of Santry from jail is--or was--an entirely different thing, an overt criminal
act, with Sheriff Thomas on our side as an unimpeachable witness."

Moran was suffering too keenly from his wound and smarting under his defeat too much to be
altogether reasonable. His manner was fast losing the appearance of respect which he had previously
shown his employer. His expression was becoming heated and contemptuous.

"You didn't base your refusal on logic at the time, Senator," he said. "It was sentiment, if
I remember right. Wade had broken bread with you, and all that. I don't see but what that applies
just as well now as it did then."

"It doesn't," the Senator argued smugly, still rankling from Wade's arraignment of him the
day before, "because even hospitality has its limits of obligation. So long as I knew Wade
to be innocent, I did not care to have him arrested; but I don't admit any sentiment of hospitality
which compels me to save a known criminal from the hand of justice. Sheriff Thomas came in
to see me last night and I agreed with him that Wade should be brought to account for his contempt
of the law. Wade forced his way into the jail and released his foreman at the point of a gun.
Even so, I feel sorry for Wade and I am a little apprehensive of the consequences that will
probably develop from his foolhardiness."

"Well, by God, if there's any sympathy for him floating around this room, it all belongs to
you, Senator." Moran tenderly fingered his aching wrist. "I'm not one of these 'turn the other
cheek' guys; you can gamble on that!"

"But now where are we?" Rexhill ignored the other's remarks entirely. "We are but little better
off than Wade is. He pulled Santry out of jail, and we tried to steal his ranch. The only difference
is that so far he has succeeded, and we have failed. He has as much law on his side now as
we have on ours."

Moran's head drooped a little before the force of this argument, although he was chiefly impressed
by the fact that he had failed. His failures had been few, because Fortune had smiled upon
him in the past; and doubtless for this reason he was the less able to treat failure philosophically.
His plans at the ranch house had gone awry. He had counted on meeting Wade there in the daytime,
in the open, and upon provoking him, before witnesses, into some hot-headed act which would
justify a battle. The surprise attack had left the agent without this excuse for the hostilities
which had occurred.

Rexhill arose and walked up and down the room in thought, his slippered feet shuffling over
the floor, showing now and then a glimpse of his fat, hairy legs as the skirt of his bathrobe
fluttered about. A cloud of fragrant smoke from his cigar trailed him as he walked, and from
the way he chewed on the tobacco his confrères in the Senate could have guessed that he was
leading up to one of his Czar-like pronouncements. Presently he stopped moving and twisted
the cigar in his mouth so that its fumes would be out of his eyes, as his glance focused on Moran.

"There's just one way out of this mess, Race," he began. "Now heed what I say to you. I'm going
to send a telegram to the Department of the Interior which will bring a troop of cavalry down
here from Fort Mackenzie. You must go slow from now on, and let the authorities settle the
whole matter."

The agent sat up alertly, as his employer, wagging a ponderous forefinger impressively, proceeded.

"You were not on the ranch for the purpose of jumping it at all. Mind that now! You and I stand
for the majesty of the law in this lawless community." Moran's eyes began to twinkle at this,
but he said nothing. "When you and Sheriff Thomas went out to the ranch, you carried two warrants
with you, one for Santry, as the accessory, and one for Wade, as the principal, in the Jensen
shooting. Yes, yes, I know what you are going to say; but I must save my own bacon now. Since
Wade has proved himself to be a lawbreaker, I'm not going to protect him."

"Now, you're talking!" exclaimed Moran, delighted at the prospect of what such a course would
start going.

"I'll have the matter of the warrants fixed up with Thomas," the Senator continued. "Now, follow
me carefully. Thomas arrested Santry at the ranch, and then left you, as his deputy, to serve
the other warrant on Wade when he came home. It was because of his knowledge of what was in
store for him that Wade, after getting Santry out of jail, attacked you and your men, and it
was in defense of the law that you returned their fire. It will all work out very smoothly,
I think, and any further hostilities will come from the other side and be to our great advantage."

Moran looked at his employer in admiration, as the latter concluded and turned toward his writing
table.

"Senator," the agent declared, as Rexhill took up his fountain pen and began to write on a
telegraph form, "you never should have started in Denver. If you'd been born in little old
New York, you'd be in the White House now. From this minute on you and I are going to carry
this whole valley in our vest-pockets."

"You take this over and put it on the wire right away, Race. It's to the Secretary of the Interior
and my signature on it should get immediate attention." Senator Rexhill handed over the telegraph
form he had filled out.

"But what about State rights in this business?" Moran asked, anxiously. "Will they send Government
troops in here on your say so?"

The Senator waved his hand in dismissal of the objection.

"I'll have Thomas wire the Governor that the situation is beyond control. This town is miles
from nowhere, and there's no militia within easy reach. The State will be glad enough to be
saved the expense, especially with the soldiers close by at Fort Mackenzie. Besides, you know,
although Wade's ranch is inside the State, a good deal of his land is Government land, or was
until he filed on it."

When Moran had left the room in a much easier frame of mind than he came into it, the Senator
sat down heavily on the bed. He was puffing at his cigar and thinking intently, when he caught
sight of the white, startled face of his daughter in the mirror of the bureau across the room.
Whirling about, he found her standing in the doorway looking at him. Rexhill had never before
been physically conscious of the fact that he had a spine, but in that moment of discovery
a chill crept up and down his back, for her expression told him that she had heard a good deal
of his conversation with Moran. The most precious thing to him in life was the respect of his
child; more precious even, he knew, than the financial security for which he fought; and in
her eyes now he saw that he was face to face with a greater battle than any he had ever waged.

"Father!"

"What, are you awake, my dear?"

He tried hard to make his tone cheery and natural, as he stood up and wrapped the bathrobe
more closely around him.

"I heard what you said to Race Moran."

Helen came into the room, with only a dressing wrapper thrown over her thin night-dress, and
dropped into a chair. She seemed to feel that her statement of the fact was accusation enough
in itself, and waited for him to answer.

"You shouldn't have listened, Helen. Moran and I were discussing private business matters,
and I thought that you were asleep. It was not proper...."

Her lips, which usually framed a smile for him, curled disdainfully and he winced in spite
of himself. He avoided the keen appraisement of her gaze, which seemed now to size him up,
as though to probe his most secret thoughts, whereas before she had always accepted him lovingly
on faith.

"Certainly, they were not matters that you would want an outsider to hear," she said, in a
hard voice, "but I am very glad that I listened, father. Glad"--her voice broke a little--"even
though I shall never be able to think of you again as I...."

He went to her and put his heavy hands on her shoulders, which shrank under his touch.

"Now, don't say things that you'll regret, Helen. You're the only girl I have, and I'm the
only father you have, so we ought to make the best of each other, oughtn't we, eh? You're prone
to hasty judgments. Don't let them run away with you now."

"Don't touch me!" He made way for her as she got to her feet. "Father,"--she tremblingly faced
him, leaning for support against a corner of the bureau,--"I heard all that you said to Mr.
Moran. I don't want you to tell me what we've been to each other. Don't I know that? Haven't
I felt it?"

The Senator swallowed hard, touched to the quick at the sight of her suffering.

"You want me to explain it--more fully?"

"If you can. Can you?" Her lips twitched spasmodically. "I want you to tell me something that
will let me continue to believe that you are--that you are--Oh, you know what I want to say."
Rexhill blushed a deep purple, despite his efforts at self-control. "But what can you say,
father; what can you say, after what I've heard?"

"You mean as regards young Wade? You know, I told you last night about his attack on the Sheriff.
You know, too"--the blush faded as the Senator caught his stride again--"that I said I meant
to crush him. You even agreed with me that he should be taught a lesson."

"But you should fight fairly," Helen retorted, with a quick breath of aggression. "Do you believe
that he killed Jensen? Of course you don't. The mere idea of such a thing is absurd."

"Perhaps he planned it."

"Father!" The scorn in her tone stung him like a whip-lash. "Did he plan the warrants, too?
The warrant that hasn't been issued yet, although you are going to swear that it was issued
yesterday. Did he plan that?"

Once in his political career, the Senator had faced an apparent impasse and had wormed out
of it through tolerant laughter. He had laughed so long and so genially that the very naturalness
of his artifice had won the day for him. Men thought that if he had had a guilty conscience,
he could not have seemed so carefree. He tried the same trick now with his daughter; but it
was a frightful attempt and he gave it up when he saw its ill-success.

"See here, Helen," he burst out, "it is ridiculous that you should arraign me in this way.
It is true that no warrant was out yesterday for Wade, but it is also true that the Sheriff
intended to issue one, and it was only through my influence that the warrant was not issued.
Since then Wade, besides insulting me, has proved himself a lawbreaker. I have nothing to do
with the consequences of his actions, which rest entirely with him. You have overheard something
that you were not intended to hear, and as is usually the case, have drawn wrong conclusions.
The best thing you can do now is to try to forget what you have heard and leave the matter
in my hands, where it belongs."

He had spoken dominantly and expected her to yield to his will. He was totally unprepared,
well as he knew her spirit, for what followed.

She faced him with glowing eyes and her trembling lips straightened into a thin, firm line
of determination. He was her father, and she had always loved him for what she had felt to
be his worth; she had given him the chance to explain, and he had not availed himself of it;
he was content to remain convicted in her eyes, or else, which was more likely, he could not
clear himself. She realized now that, despite what she had said in pique, only the night before,
she really loved Wade, and he, at least, had done nothing, except free a friend, who, like
himself, was unjustly accused. She could not condemn him for that, any more than she could
forget her father's duplicity.

"I won't forget it!" she cried. "If necessary, I will go to Gordon and tell him what you've
done. I'll tell it to every one in Crawling Water, if you force me to. I don't want to because,
just think what that would mean to you! But you shall not sacrifice Gordon. Yes, I mean it--I'll
sacrifice you first!"

"Don't talk so loud," the Senator warned her anxiously, going a little white. "Don't be a fool,
Helen. Why, it was only a few hours ago that you said Wade should be punished."

She laughed hysterically.

"That was only because I wanted to get him away from this awful little town. I thought that
if he were--punished--a little, if he was made a laughing stock, he might be ashamed, and not
want to stay here. Now, I see that I was wrong. I don't blame him for fighting with every weapon
he can find. I hope he wins!"

Rexhill, who had been really frightened at her hysterical threat of exposure, and assailed
by it in his pride as well, felt his fear begin to leave him and his confidence in himself
return. In the next minute or two, he thought rapidly and to considerable purpose. In the past
he had resolutely refused to use his child in any way to further his own ends, but the present
occasion was an emergency, and major surgery is often demanded in a crisis. If she were willing,
as she said, to sacrifice him, he felt that he might properly make use of her and her moods
to save himself and her as well. He realized that if she were to shout abroad through Crawling
Water the conversation that had passed between him and Moran, the likelihood of either of the
two men getting out of the county alive would be extremely remote.

"So that was it, eh? And I complimented you upon your good sense!" His laugh was less of an
effort now. "Well, doesn't it hold good now as well as it did then? Come, my dear, sit down
and we'll thresh this out quietly."

She shook her head stubbornly, but the woman in her responded to the new note of confidence
in his voice, and she waited eagerly for what he had to say, hopeful that he might still clear
himself.

"You tell me that I must fight fair. Well, I usually do fight that way. I'm doing so now. When
I spoke yesterday of crushing Wade, I meant it and I still mean it. But there are limits to
what I want to see happen to him; for one thing, I don't want to see him hung for this Jensen
murder, even if he's guilty."

"You know he isn't guilty."

"I think he isn't." Her eyes lighted up at this admission. "But he must be tried for the crime,
there's no dodging that. The jury will decide the point; we can't. But even if he should be
convicted, I shouldn't want to see him hung. Why, we've been good friends, all of us. I--I
like him, even though he did jump on to me yesterday. That was why"--he leaned forward, impelled
to the falsehood that hung upon his tongue by the desperate necessity of saving himself his
daughter's love and respect--"I arranged with Moran to have the boy arrested on such a warrant.
He is bound to be arrested"--Rexhill struck the table with his fist--"and if he should need
a basis for an appeal after conviction, he could hardly have a better one than the evidence
of conspiracy, which a crooked warrant would afford. I wanted to give him that chance because
I realized that he had enemies here and that his trial might not be a fair one. When the right
moment came I was going to have that warrant looked into."

"Father!"

Helen dropped on her knees before him, her eyelashes moist with tears and her voice vibrant
with happiness.

"Why didn't you explain all that before, Father? I knew that there must be some explanation.
I felt that I couldn't have loved you all my life for nothing. But do you really believe that
any jury would convict Gordon of such a thing?"

"I hope not."

Never had Senator Rexhill felt himself more hopelessly a scoundrel than now as he smoothed
her hair from her forehead; but he told himself that the pain of this must be less than to
be engulfed in bankruptcy, or exposure, which would submerge them all. Moreover, he promised
himself that if future events bore too heavily against Wade, he should be saved at the eleventh
hour. The thought of this made the Senator's position less hard.

"I hope not, Helen," he repeated. "Of course, the serving of the warrant at this time will
help my own interests, but since a warrant must be served, anyway, I feel justified, under
the circumstances, in availing myself of this advantage."

"Y-e-s, of course," Helen agreed doubtfully. "Oh, it is all too bad. I wish none of us had
ever heard of Crawling Water."

"Well, maybe the Grand Jury will not indict him, feeling runs so strong here," her father continued,
and she took fresh hope at this prospect. "But, anyway, he will feel the pressure before all
is done with, and very likely he'll be only too glad to dispose of his ranch and say good-by
to Wyoming when he is free to do as he pleases. Then you and he can make a fresh start, eh?
All will be sunshine and roses then, maybe, forever and aye."

"That's what I want to do--get away from here; and that was all I meant when I said to punish
Gordon."

The Senator patted her cheek tenderly and drew a deep breath of relief.

"By the way, father," Helen said casually, when she started back to her room, a little later,
"I saw Miss Purnell on the street yesterday. You know, she was out when Gordon took me to see her."

"Well, is she dangerous?"

Helen looked at him in amusement, and shrugged her shoulders.

CHAPTER XI

TANGLED THREADS

Relieved though Helen was to some extent, by her father's assurances and by the explanation
which he had given, she was far from being in a tranquil frame of mind.

She knew that whatever might be the outcome of the graver charge against Gordon, he would probably
have to suffer for his release of Santry, and she found herself wishing more than ever that
her lover had never seen the West. What little it had contributed to his character was not
worth what it had cost already and would cost in the future. Surely, his manhood was alive
enough not to have needed the development of such an environment, and if his lot had been cast
in the East, she could have had him always with her. A long letter, which she had recently
received from Maxwell Frayne, recounting the gayeties of New York and Washington, made her
homesick. Although she could scarcely think of the two men at the same moment, still, as she
sat in the crude little hotel, she would have welcomed a little of young Frayne's company for
the sake of contrast. She was yearning for the flesh-pots of her own Egypt.

From the news of the fight at the ranch, which had been brought to town by the messenger, she
gathered that Wade meant to intrench himself on the ranch and defy the law, which would probably
embroil him in other criminal acts. Crawling Water, too, was rapidly filling up with armed
cattlemen, who, she thought, would do Gordon's cause more harm than good. Toward afternoon,
word came of a bloody skirmish on the Trowbridge range, between a number of his punchers and
some of Moran's hired men, and that added to the tension among those crowding the main street.

From the parlor windows of the hotel she watched what was going on outside, not without alarm,
so high did feeling seem to run. The threats of the ranch men, handed about amongst themselves
but loud enough for her to catch a word now and then, made her wonder if the town was really
safe for her father, or for herself. A storm was coming up, and the rising wind whipped the
flimsy lace curtains of the windows and kept them fluttering like flags. The distant muttering
of the thunder and an occasional sharp flash of lightning wore on her tired nerves until she
could sit still no longer.

For the sake of something to do, she went up to her room, intending to write some letters there,
but her bed had not been made up, so she returned to the parlor with her fountain pen and writing-pad.
To Maxwell Frayne she wrote a brief note, which was not likely to cheer him much. She had become
so in the habit of taking her moods out on Maxwell that to do so, even with a pen, was second
nature to her. She despised him for his tolerance of her tyranny, never realizing that he reserved
to himself the privilege of squaring their account, if she should ever become his wife.

Then to ease her mind of the strain it bore, she wrote at some length to her mother; not telling
the whole truth but enough of it to calm her own nervousness. She said nothing of the conversation
she had overheard, but went fully into the scene between her father and Gordon Wade. With a
little smile hovering on her lips, she wrote dramatically of the Senator's threat to crush
the ranchman. "That will please mother," she said to herself, as her pen raced over the paper.
"Gordon felt, you see, that"--she turned a page--"father knew Santry had not killed Jensen,
and...."

The hotel-keeper poked his head in at the doorway.

"Two ladies to see you, Miss," he announced. "Mrs. Purnell and daughter."

He gave Helen no chance to avoid the visit, for with the obviousness of the plains, he had
brought the visitors upstairs with him, and so, blotting what she had written and weighing
down her letter against the breeze, she arose to greet them.

"This is good of you, Mrs. Purnell, and I am so glad to meet your daughter. I've been lonely
and blue all day and now you have taken pity on me."

Mrs. Purnell shot an "I told you so" glance at Dorothy, which made that young lady smile to
herself.

"I was sorry not to have been at home when you called, Miss Rexhill."

The two girls looked at each other, each carefully veiling hostility, Dorothy beneath a natural
sweetness of disposition, and Helen with the savoir faire of social experience. Each felt and
was stung by a realization of the other's points of advantage. Dorothy saw a perfection of
well-groomed poise, such as she could hardly hope to attain, and Helen was impressed with her
rival's grace and natural beauty.

"Won't you sit down?"

"But aren't we disturbing you?" Mrs. Purnell asked, with a glance toward the writing materials.

"Indeed, you are not. I was writing some duty letters to kill time. I'm only too glad to stop
because I'm really in no writing mood and I am most anxious to hear what is going on outside.
Isn't it dreadful about Mr. Wade?"

"You mean his helping Santry?" Dorothy asked, with a little touch of pride which did not escape
her hostess.

"Partly that; but more because he is sure to be arrested himself. I've been terribly worried."

Dorothy glanced at her keenly and smiled.

"I have an idea that they may find Gordon hard to arrest," she remarked.

"Yes," Mrs. Purnell put in. "He is so popular. Still, I agree with you that there is every
cause for anxiety." The good lady did not have a chance every day to agree with the daughter
of a United States Senator, and the opportunity was not to be overlooked.

"The people feel so strongly that Santry should never have been arrested that they are not
likely to let Gordon be taken just for freeing him," Dorothy explained.

Helen shook her head with every indication of tremulous worry.

"But it isn't that alone," she insisted. "He's to be arrested for the Jensen shooting. That
was why the posse waited at his ranch after Santry had been caught."

"For the Jensen shooting?" Dorothy showed her amazement very plainly. "Are you sure?" she demanded,
and when Helen nodded, exclaimed: "Why, how utterly absurd! I understood that you were with
him yourself when he received word of it?"

"I was," Helen admitted. "He is supposed only to have planned the crime, I believe. He's supposed
to have been the principal, isn't that what they call it?" She appealed to Mrs. Purnell.

"Oh, but do you think he could do such a thing?" Mrs. Purnell asked, much shocked.

"I don't know. I hope not."

"I do know!" Dorothy burst out emphatically. "I know Gordon Wade too well to think for one
minute that he did it; and every true friend of his ought to speak out at once and say the
same thing."

The challenge in her voice was unmistakable, and Mrs. Purnell moved uneasily in her chair.
She glanced anxiously at Helen and was relieved to see that the latter had lost none of her poise.

"I hope so as fully as you do," Helen said sweetly, "but things move so fast here in these
mountains that I find it hard to keep up with them."

"Of course," Mrs. Purnell soothed, with a troubled look at her daughter.

"Who swore out the warrant, I wonder?" Dorothy asked, in a more tranquil tone, a bit ashamed
of her outburst. "Was it Mr. Moran?"

"I'm sure I don't know," Helen answered. "I supposed it was the Sheriff. Why should Mr. Moran
have anything to do with it?"

"Because he seems to have been concerned in all the trouble we have had," Dorothy replied calmly.
"This was a peaceful little community until Mr. Moran moved into it."

Helen made no direct reply to this, and for awhile Dorothy allowed her mother to sustain the
conversation. She had no doubt but that Moran was back of it all, and she was thinking of what
Lem Trowbridge had said; that if they could only "get something on" Moran and the Senator,
a solution of the whole problem would be at hand. She thought that she had detected a defensive
note in Helen's voice, and she was wondering why it should have been there.

"But you haven't answered my question yet about Mr. Moran," Helen presently challenged her.
"You seemed to have something more in mind than what you said. Would you mind telling me?"

Dorothy looked steadily but not offensively at her.

"Oh, it's nothing, Miss Rexhill. I was only thinking that he has gone rather far: been very
zealous in your father's interests. Probably...."

"Why, Dorothy--!" her mother interposed, in a shocked tone.

"Miss Rexhill asked me, mother, and you know that I always speak frankly."

"Yes, do go on," Helen urged, with even an added touch of sweetness in her manner. "I really
want to know. I am so out of touch with things here, so ill informed."

"Well, you can sit here at the windows and learn all you wish to know. There isn't a man in
this town that would see Gordon arrested and not fight to free him. Feeling is running high
here now. You know, it's something like a violin string. You can stretch it just so far and
then it snaps. That's all."

"Dorothy, I'm really mortified that you...."

"Oh, you've no occasion to be, Mrs. Purnell," Helen interrupted, smiling. "I asked for the
plain truth, you know."

Mrs. Purnell laughed feebly.

"Dorothy has known Mr. Wade so long and we both like him so well that she can't bear to hear
a word against him," she explained. Her sense of lèse majesté was running away with her judgment,
and Dorothy shot an irritated glance at her. "Not that I think he did it at all, you understand;
but...."

"Oh, perfectly," declared Helen, with rising color and an equal feeling of annoyance. "Oh,
dear me, do look at my poor letters!"

A gust of wind, stronger than any that had come before, had swept the weight to the floor and
scattered letter paper, envelopes, and blotter about the room. Helen was just able to catch
the writing-pad as it slid to the floor, while Dorothy and her mother laughingly salvaged the
rest. The incident happily relieved the awkward drift of their conversation, and they all felt
relieved.

"Well, now, did you ever?" Mrs. Purnell ejaculated, looking at the lithographed blotter, which
she held in her hand. "I declare this picture of a little girl reminds me of Dorothy when she
was that age."

"Oh, mother!"

"Really?" Helen broke in. "How interesting. I hadn't noticed the picture. Do let me see."

To be courteous, she agreed with Mrs. Purnell that there was a strong likeness, which Dorothy
laughingly denied.

"I guess I know what you looked like when you were five better than you do," Mrs. Purnell declared.
"It's the image of you as you were then, and as Miss Rexhill says, there is a facial resemblance
even yet."

"Perhaps you would like to take it with you, then," Helen suggested, to Mrs. Purnell's delight,
who explained that the only picture she had of Dorothy at that age had been lost.

"If it wouldn't deprive you?"

"No, indeed. You must take it. I have a large blotter in my writing-pad, so I really don't
need that one at all. So many such things are sent to father that we always have more than
we can use up."

When Dorothy and her mother left the hotel, urged homeward by the first big drops of the coming
rain, Mrs. Purnell tucked the blotter in the bosom of her dress, happy to have the suggestion
of the picture to recall the days when her husband's presence cheered them all. Her world had
been a small one, and little things like this helped to make it bright.

Soon afterward the supper bell rang, and during the meal Helen told the Senator, who seemed
somewhat morose and preoccupied, of the visit she had had.

"Sure tiresome people. Goodness! I was glad to see them at first because I thought they would
help me to pass the afternoon, but instead I was bored to death. That little minx is crazy
about Gordon, though. I could see that."

"Um!"

"And the worst of it is that she just fits into the scenery here, and I don't. You know, father,
I never could wax enthusiastic over shooing the cows to roost and things like that."

"Um!"

"I feel like a deaf person at a concert, here in this town."

This remark brought a wry laugh from her father, and Helen smiled.

"Well, I've made you laugh, anyway," she said. "You're frightfully grouchy this evening."

"My dear, I'm busy, very busy, and I haven't time to think of trifles. I'll be at it most of
the night."

"Oh, shall you? Goodness, that's cheerful. I wish I had never come to this awful little place.
I suppose I must go back to my letters for something to do. And, father," she added, as he
lingered with her for a moment in the hallway, "the Purnells seem to think that you and Mr.
Moran had better not go too far. The people here are very much wrought up."

He patted her shoulder affectionately.

"You leave all that to me and go write to your mother."

There was nothing else for her to do, so she returned to the parlor. When she had finished
her letters, she idly picked up a week-old copy of a Denver newspaper which lay on the table
and glanced through the headlines. She was yawningly thinking of bed, when Moran came into
the room.

"Oh, are you and father through at last?"

"Yes," he answered, smiling. "That is, we're through upstairs. I'm on my way over to the office
to straighten up a few loose ends before I turn in. There's no rest for the weary, you know."

"Don't let me keep you, then," she said dryly, as he lingered. "I'm going to bed."

"You're not keeping me. I'm keeping myself." He quite understood her motive, but he was not
thin-skinned, and he had learned that he had to make his opportunities with her. "Your father
told me you were getting anxious."

"Not anxious, tired."

"Things are getting a little warm here, but before there's any real danger we expect to have
the soldiers here to take charge."

He rather ostentatiously displayed his bandaged wrist, hoping to win her sympathy, but she
professed none. Instead, she yawned and tapped her lips with her fingers, and her indifference
piqued him.

"I was talking with Dorothy Purnell this afternoon," Helen finally remarked, eyeing him lazily,
"and she seems to be of the opinion that you'll have hard work arresting Gordon Wade. I rather
hope that you do."

"Well--" He teetered a little on his feet and stroked his mustache. "We may have, at that.
Miss Purnell is popular and she can make a lot of trouble for us if she wants to. Being very
fond of Wade, she's likely to do all that she can."

"Would she really have so much influence?" Helen asked, carefully guarding her tongue.

He laughed softly as though amused at the thought.

"Influence? Evidently you don't realize what a good looking girl means in a frontier town like
this. She's part sister, part mother, sweetheart and a breath from Heaven to every man in Crawling
Water. On that account, with one exception, I've had to import every last one of my men. The
exception is Tug Bailey, who's beyond hope where women are concerned. To all the rest, Dorothy
Purnell is 'Wade's girl,' and they wouldn't fight against her, or him, for all the money in
Wyoming."

He was watching her keenly as he spoke, and was gratified to see spots of color spring to her
cheeks.

"How interesting!" Helen could make her tone indifferent to the point of languor, but she could
not keep the gleam of jealousy out of her eyes. "Gordon is a fortunate man to have such an
able ally, isn't he?"

"The finish will decide that, I should say," Moran replied sneeringly. "She may stir up more
trouble than all her friends can take care of."

For all of her social schooling, Helen was not proof against the sneer in his words, even though
she fully saw through his purpose to wound her. She felt her temper rising, and with it came
curiosity to learn how far the relationship between Wade and Dorothy Purnell had really gone.
That Moran would exaggerate it, she felt sure, for he had his own ends to gain, but possibly
from out of his exaggeration she could glean some truth. Yet she did not want to go so far
in her anger as to gratify his malice, and this placed her in something of a dilemma.

"I don't believe that she is 'Wade's girl,' as you call her, at all," she said coldly. "They
may be good friends, and if so, I'm glad; but they are nothing more than that. There is no
'understanding' between them."

Moran carelessly waved his hand in the direction of the rain-swept street, illuminated now
and then by the lightning.

"Ask any one in Crawling Water."

"That sounds well, but it's impracticable, even if I wanted to do it. I prefer to draw my own
conclusions."

The agent drew up a chair with his well hand, and sat down with that easy familiarity that
came so natural to him. Helen watched him, lazily impertinent.

"I've been wanting to have a talk with you, Helen," he began, "and this looks like a good chance
to me. You've been foolish about Wade. Yes, I know that you're thinking that I've got my own
ends to further, which is true enough. I have. I admit it. But what I am going to tell you
is true, also. Fortune's been playing into my hand here lately. Now, if you'll be reasonable,
you'll probably be happier. Shall I go on?"

"Wild horses couldn't stop you," she answered, amused that he seemed flattered. "But if we
were in Washington, I fancy I'd have you shown out."

"We're not in Washington, my dear girl." He wagged his finger at her, in the way her father
had, to give emphasis to his words. "That's where you've made your mistake with Wade. We're
all just plain men and women out here in the cattle country, and I'm talking its language,
not the language of drawing-rooms." He was himself a little surprised at the swift dilation
of her pupils, but his words had probed deeper than he knew, reminding her as they did of the
truth which she had so fully realized that afternoon. "Wade liked you--loved you, maybe, in
Chicago, but this ain't the East. He cares nothing for you here, and he'd never be happy away
from here. You know that picture of yourself that you sent to him?" She nodded. "Well, we found
it on the floor of his room, covered with dust. He hadn't even troubled to pick it up from
where it must have fallen weeks ago."

She looked at him dumbly, unable to keep her lips from twitching. He knew that she believed
him, and he was glad; that she had to believe him, because his story bore the impress of truth.
It was not something that he could have made up.

"And while your picture was lying there, Wade and this Purnell girl were making goo-goo eyes
at each other. Why, it was she that rode out to warn him that we were after Santry." Helen's
lips curled. "I can't swear to that, but I heard it and I believe it myself. They must've met
on the trail somewhere in the dark, and you can bet he was grateful. I don't imagine that they
stopped at a hand-shake. I imagine they kissed, don't you?"

"Oh, I'm tired, worn out," Helen declared, forcing a smile so artificial that it could not
deceive him. "Do go, please. I am going upstairs to bed."

"Wait one minute." He put out his injured arm, and, thinking that he reached for her hand,
she brushed it aside, accidentally striking his wound.

"I'm sorry if I hurt you," she said coldly, as he winced.

"Maybe I've hurt you worse," he persisted, with a tenderness that was intolerable to her, "but,
if I have, your wound'll heal just as mine will." He gently pushed her back into her chair
as she started to get up.

"Are you making love to me, Race?" Under the ridicule of her tone his face darkened. "If you
are, it's insufferable in you."

"Go easy, now," he warned her. "I'll not be made a fool of."

She did not heed his warning. Glad to have him on the rack, where she had been, she laughed at him.

"Haven't you sense enough to know that, for that very reason, I'd refuse to believe anything
you might say against Gordon Wade? I know how you hate him. Listen to me. Oh, this is absurd!"
She laughed again at the picture he made. "You've pursued me for months with your attentions,
although I've done everything but encourage you. Now I want you to know that I shall never
again even listen to you. What Gordon is to Dorothy Purnell is for him, and her, and perhaps
for me to be interested in, but not for you. Now I'm going to bed. Good night!"

He caught her by the arm as she stood up, but immediately released her, and stepped in front
of her instead.

"Hold on," he begged, with a smile that meant wonderful mastery of himself. "I've got feelings,
you know. You needn't walk on them. I love you, and I want you. What I want, I usually get.
I mean to get you." She looked up at him with heavy-lidded insolence. "I may fail, but if I
do, it'll be one more notch in my account against Wade. I know now where to strike him--to hurt."

"You be reasonable, and you'll be happier," she retorted. "May I go?"

"Certainly." He stepped out of her way. "Good night."

CHAPTER XII

DESPERATE MEASURES

If Moran or Helen, early in their conversation, had looked out of the window of the hotel,
during one of those vivid lightning flashes, they might have seen a woman stealthily approaching
the agent's office across the street. Taking advantage of the deeper shadows and of the darkness
between lightning flashes, she stole to the rear of the building, where she found an unlatched
window, through which she scrambled with the agility of a boy.

Within, the place was pitch dark, but like one amid familiar surroundings, she crossed the
hall and found the room she sought; the office room now of Moran, but formerly occupied by
Simon Barsdale. She bent over the big safe, and was twirling the combination knob in her slim,
cold fingers, when she was startled by a noise in the hallway outside. With a gasp of fright,
she stood motionless, listening acutely, but there was no further sound; reassured, she produced
a bit of candle, which she lighted and placed to one side of the safe, so that the flame was
shaded from the windows. She was in the act of manipulating the combination again when, her
whole body rigid with fear, she stood erect once more, holding her breath and striving for
self-control. There was no doubt about the noise this time. Some one had entered the adjoining
room.

Hastily snuffing out the candle, she crouched into the darkness of a corner. She never doubted
that the newcomer was Race Moran, or that he would almost immediately discover her. She tried
to summon enough resolution to bluff things through when the moment of discovery should come.

But, as the seconds slipped by and the lights were not turned on, she began to regain her courage.
Perhaps Moran was sitting in the dark of the other room, smoking and thinking, and perhaps
she could complete her task without being caught, if she moved swiftly and silently. She bent
again over the shining knob, at the same time watching in the direction of the door, which
was still closed as she had left it. It was difficult to work the lock in the dark, and, as
she became engrossed with her purpose, she ceased temporarily to listen acutely. She had just
succeeded in effecting the combination, when something touched her side.

"Don't move!" a voice hissed behind her. "I'll shoot if you do!"

She wanted to cry out, "Please don't shoot!" but her tongue clove to the roof of her mouth,
which had suddenly gone dry. She had fallen forward against the door of the safe, and was curiously
conscious how cold it felt. She was on the point of fainting, when in a rush of relief it dawned
upon her that she knew the voice; it was not Moran's.

"Gordon!" she cried joyously, finding the use of her tongue as quickly as she had lost it,
and scrambling to her feet. "It's me--Dorothy!"

With an exclamation as joyous as her own and equally surprised, he seized her by the shoulders,
peering through the darkness into her face.

"Dorothy! What the...?" A lightning flash revealed them clearly to each other. "I told you
not to try this."

"But what are you doing in town?" She clutched his arms, overcome by a fear greater than that
for her own safety. "Gordon, Gordon, you must not stay here. There's a warrant out for you--no,
no, not for that--for the Jensen shooting. You'll be arrested on sight."

"What?" He stared at her, amazed, and she nodded. "So that's their game now, eh? They've stooped
even to that. By God!" He struck a match.

"Be careful," she warned him instantly. "The light--put it out. They'll see it from the street.
But, oh, Gordon, why did you come?"

He thrilled at the anxiety in her voice.

"To find out what Moran is hiding here; and you're after the same thing, of course."

"Yes."

Impulsively, he squeezed her fingers, until she could have cried out in pain but for the sweetness
of it; there are some agonies which do not hurt. Her throat swelled with joy, her breast heaved,
and her eyelids fluttered. She was grateful for the darkness, which hid these outward signs
of love from him. She blushed; she could feel the warm tide pulsing in her temples; and she
laughed brokenly from sheer happiness.

"You shouldn't have taken such a risk, Dorothy. I told you not to."

"You're taking that risk, Gordon, and more."

"That's different. It's so dark a night, I thought I'd chance it."

"There's not much risk for me," she declared. "I can reach home in five minutes. Isn't it odd,
though, that we both should have thought of doing it at exactly the same time. But come, Gordon,
we must hurry!"

Now that the safe was open, to remove its contents took only a moment, and they tossed all
the papers they found into a corner. Then, when Wade had swung the safe around on its casters,
they had a snug shelter behind it, where by shaded candle-light they ran rapidly through their
loot. Most of the documents related to land purchases and development, but at the bottom of
the pile Wade came upon a bundle of papers and blue-prints, held together by a rubber band,
which he stripped off.

"Oh, if we should find nothing, after all," Dorothy whispered, bending with him over the blue-prints.
"What are they, Gordon?"

"Maps of my own range, Dorothy!" His tone was tense with excitement, as he leaned nearer to
the light. "Well, what do you know about that? By Heaven"--He fairly glared at the sheet before
his eyes.--"It's all there!"

"What's all there? What is it?"

"Gold!" He looked at her in the flickering light, like a man gone mad.

"Gold? On your range? Oh, Gordon!"

"Yes; on my range. It's inconceivable, almost; but it seems to be true. See! Look here!" Their
heads were almost touching, so that her soft hair caressed his face. "This is a map of the
upper valley, and the description says these red crosses indicate the location of gold. One
is near the head of Piah Creek, not half a mile from my buildings."

"Oh, Gordon, I am so glad!" Dorothy exclaimed. "How wonderful it all is. You'll be rich, won't
you?" She was not too excited to remember that his wealth would probably be shared by another
woman, but she was too generous to be any the less glad on that account.

"That remains to be seen," he replied. "It may not prove to amount to much, you know. At any
rate, Moran won't get any of it. That's worth a whole lot."

She nodded vehemently.

"I thought it must be something like that, Gordon. They would never have done the things they
have without some powerful reason."

"Yes, you were right, Dorothy. You're usually right." He caught her hand and squeezed it again,
and in this moment of their triumph together she could not help returning the pressure. "You're
a jewel, a brick, a trump--all those things and then some. The sweet...."

"Now, we haven't time for that sort of thing, Mr. Man. We...."

"Must get away while we can, yes," he finished for her. "But just the same I...."

Her cold fingers on his lips stopped him.

"Listen!"

She put out the candle and they crouched down beside the safe. Some one was coming up the stairs,
not stealthily this time but boldly, as one who had a right there, whistling softly. Wade could
feel the girl's shoulder tremble against his side, as he slipped his revolver out of its holster.

"Don't, Gordon! You--you mustn't shoot, no matter what happens." Her teeth were chattering,
for she was far more frightened now than she had been for herself alone. "That's Moran. He
mustn't see you here. Remember that warrant. Hide behind the safe. Please!"

"Never!" he muttered grimly. "He'd find us anyhow."

"Yes, yes. Please!" She was almost hysterical in her excitement. "I can bluff him till you
can get away. He won't hurt me. If he does you can show yourself. Do it for me, for your friends.
Please! Remember, he mustn't know that you've learned his secret."

It was Moran, for they heard him now in conversation with some passer-by in the hallway. Dorothy
was grateful for the respite, for it gave them time to throw the loose papers back into the
safe and close it. Wade then pushed the safe to its original position, the casters making little
noise as they rolled. Then he crouched behind it.

"I don't like this stunt!" he protested; but yielded to her beseeching "Please." She was right,
too, he knew. It would be far better if Moran could be kept in ignorance of his visit there.

The office now bore little sign of their invasion of it, and, drawing a deep breath, Dorothy
schooled herself to calmness as she awaited Moran, who was walking down the hall toward the
entrance to the room. A plan had flashed into her mind by means of which she might save both
Wade and herself, if he and her heart would only be quiet. The unruly heart was beating so
violently that it shook her thin dress, and that her voice must tremble, she knew.

Moran was almost at the threshold, when Dorothy opened the door for him.

"Good evening, Mr. Moran. Did I startle you?"

"Well, not exactly," he said, striking a match, after an instant's pause. "What are you doing
here?"

Passing her, he lighted the large oil lamp, and swept the room with a quick, keen glance. Finding
nothing apparently wrong, he turned again to his visitor with a puzzled expression in his face.

"Well?"

"I wanted to see you and I thought you'd be here. The door was unlocked so I just walked in.
I've been here only a minute or two." Fortified by another deep breath, drawn while his back
was turned, Dorothy found her voice steadier than she expected.

The agent looked at her keenly.

"That's strange," he commented. "I don't know what the door was doing unlocked. I always lock
it when I leave."

"You must have forgotten to do so to-night."

"I surely must have, if you found it open."

Half convinced that she was telling the truth, Moran could see but one reason for her evident
fright: she was afraid of him. The suggestion of that strengthened the impulse which her beauty
stirred in him. If she thought so, why not?

"Say, you're a good-looking kid, all right," he leered. "What did you want to see me for?"

A slight sound from behind the safe, or perhaps she imagined it, caused Dorothy's heart to
flutter wildly. She had not anticipated this attitude in Moran, and she instantly realized
that it brought a fresh danger into the situation. She knew that Wade would not remain in concealment
if the agent insulted her. She must avoid the chance of that, if possible; must get him out
of the office so that Gordon might escape.

"This is no place to talk that way," she said bravely. "It isn't a good place for me to be
anyway. If people knew I was here, there would be a terrible scandal. I've something important
to tell you. Won't you come for a walk?"

"In this rain? Not much," he chuckled. "Come here!" She shook her head and tried to smile.
"Well, if you won't, I'll have to go to you." She shrank back from him, as he approached her,
with an evil smile. "Say, little one," he went on, "this is a damned funny game of yours, coming
here at night. What's the idea, eh?"

"There isn't any, really." She snatched her hands away from him. "I've already tried to explain
that I have important news for you; but I won't tell you what it is here."

"Why not? We're dry and cozy here. Go ahead."

"No."

"Oh, come on!" He had driven her to the wall, and now he slipped an arm about her waist and
pulled her toward him. "Say, kiss me once, won't you?"

"Hands up, you low-lived hound!"

With an oath, Moran whirled around to find himself staring into the muzzle of Wade's revolver.
The ranchman moved his weapon significantly.

"Up!"

As the agent's hands went above his head, Dorothy leaned against the wall for support. She
had not made a sound, but she was the color of chalk, and her heart seemed to be trying to
jump out of her mouth. She was no whiter than Wade, whose fury had driven every vestige of
color from his face and fired his eyes with a murderous light.

"Shall I kill him?" he asked Dorothy, and at the frightful tone of his voice she found the
power to shake her head, although her mouth was too dry for speech.

"Take his gun," said Wade sharply and the girl stepped forward.

She reeled toward Moran, who, to do him justice, showed little fear, and pulled his revolver
from his hip pocket. She held it out to Wade, who broke it with his free hand by pressing the
butt against the top of the safe, and spilled the cartridges on the floor.

"Now you can leave us, Dorothy," he said quietly.

"No. I'll stay, Gordon," she answered.

"Moran," Wade continued evenly, without paying any more attention to her, "the only reason
why I shall not kill you is because Miss Purnell does not want your worthless life upon her
conscience. A man like you ought to die. You're not fit to live."

"Can I put my hands down?"

"No; keep 'em where they are!" Wade gestured again with the gun. "I wish I had a string on
each of your thumbs so I could hoist them higher. I've just been through this safe of yours."
The agent started. "I've got those maps of my range in my pocket."

"Much good they'll do you."

"They'll do me more good alive than they will you dead, and you're going to die. So help me
God, you are! We'll come together again some day."

"I hope so," Moran declared venomously, and even Dorothy was struck by the courage he showed.

"And then there won't be anybody to be held responsible but me." Wade grinned in a slow, horrible
fashion. "It'll rest light on me, I promise you. And another thing. I'm going to leave you
trussed up here in this office, like I left your friend the Sheriff a few days ago, and along
about morning somebody'll find you and turn you loose. When you get loose, you want to forget
that you saw Miss Purnell here to-night. I've meant to have her and her mother leave town for
a bit until this mess blows over, but things aren't fixed right for that just now. Instead,
I'm going to leave her in the personal care--the personal care, you understand me, of every
decent man in Crawling Water. If anything happens to her, you'll toast over a slow fire before
you die. Do you get that?"

"She's a good kid," said Moran, with a grin. Nor did he flinch when the weapon in Wade's hand
seemed actually to stiffen under the tension of his grasp.

"I guess it's a good thing you stayed, Dorothy," the latter remarked grimly. "This fellow must
be tied up. I wonder what we can find to do it with?"

"My cloak?" Dorothy suggested. "It's an old one."

He shook his head.

"It's hard to tear that rain-proof stuff, and besides you'd get wet going home. There's no
sense in that. Isn't there something else?"

She blushed a little and turned away for a moment, during which she slipped off her underskirt.
Then, as Moran watched her cynically, she tore it into strips. When she had thus made several
stout bands, Wade spoke again.

"You take the first throw or two about him," he directed, "and when you have him partly tied
you can take my gun and I'll finish the job. Start with his feet, that's right. Now draw it
as tight as you can. Put your arms down back of you! Tie them now, Dorothy. That's fine! Here,
you take the gun. You know how to use it, if he struggles."

Wade tightened up the linen bands, and kicked forward a straight-backed chair, into which he
forced Moran and lashed him fast there, to all of which the agent made no great protest, knowing
that to do so would be useless. He grunted and swore a bit under his breath, but that was all.
When he was well trussed up, the ranchman made a gag out of what was left of the linen and
his own handkerchief and strapped it into his prisoner's mouth with his belt.

When the job was done, and it was a good one, he grinned again in that slow, terrible way.
A grin that bore no semblance to human mirth, but was a grimace of combined anger and hatred.
Once before, during the fight at the ranch, Bill Santry had seen this expression on his employer's
face, but not to the degree that Dorothy now saw it. It frightened her.

"Oh, Gordon, don't, please!" She closed her eyes to shut out the sight. "Come, we must hurry away."

"Good night," Wade said ironically, with a last look at Moran.

He let Dorothy draw him away then, and by the time they reached the street he was his old boyish
self again. Aping Moran, he slipped his arm around her waist, but she did not shrink from his
embrace, unexpected though it was.

"Say, kid," he laughed mockingly. "Kiss me once, won't you?"

CHAPTER XIII

INTO THE DEPTHS

"Good Lord, Race! What's happened?"

Senator Rexhill, on the next morning, surprised that Moran did not show up at the hotel, had
gone in search of him, and was dumbfounded when he entered the office.

Moran, in his desperate efforts to free himself, had upset the chair into which he was tied,
and being unable to right it again, had passed most of the night in a position of extreme discomfort.
Toward morning, his confinement had become positive agony, and he had inwardly raved at Wade,
the gag in his mouth making audible expression impossible, until he was black in the face.

"My God, Race!" the Senator exclaimed, when, having cut the lashings and withdrawn the gag,
he saw his agent in a state bordering on collapse, "what has happened to you?" He helped the
man to his feet and held him up.

"My throat--dry--whiskey!" Moran gasped, and groaned as he clutched at the desk, from which
he slid into a chair, where he sat rubbing his legs, which ached with a thousand pains.

Rexhill found a bottle of whiskey and a glass on a shelf in the closet. He poured out a generous
drink of the liquor and handed it to Moran, but the agent could not hold it in his swollen
fingers. The Senator picked up the glass, which had not broken in its fall and, refilling it,
held it to Moran's lips. It was a stiff drink, and by the time it was repeated, the agent was
revived somewhat.

"Now, tell me," urged Rexhill.

Prepared though he was for an outburst of fury, he was amazed at the torrent of blasphemous
oaths which Moran uttered. He caught Wade's name, but the rest was mere incoherence, so wildly
mouthed and so foul that he began to wonder if torture had unbalanced the man's mind. The expression
of Moran's eyes, which had become mere slits in his inflamed and puffy face, showed that for
the time he was quite beyond himself. What with his blued skin and distended veins, his puffed
lips and slurred speech, he seemed on the brink of an apoplectic seizure. Rexhill watched him
anxiously.

"Come, come, man. Brace up," he burst out, at length. "You'll kill yourself, if you go on that
way. Be a man."

The words seemed to have their effect, for the agent made a supreme effort at the self-control
which was seldom lacking in him. He appeared to seize the reins of self-government and to force
himself into a state of unnatural quiet, as one tames a frantic horse.

"The safe!" he muttered hoarsely, scrambling to his feet.

His stiffened legs still refused to function, however, and Rexhill, hastening to the safe,
threw open the door. One glance at the disordered interior told him the whole story. Moran
watched feverishly as he dragged the crumpled papers out on the floor and pawed through them.

"Gone?"

"Gone!"

They looked at each other, a thin tide of crimson brightening the congestion of Moran's visage,
while Rexhill's face went ghastly white. With shaking fingers, the agent poured himself a third
drink and tossed it down his throat.

"It was Wade who tied you up?"

Moran nodded.

"Him and that--girl--the Purnell girl." Stirred more by the other's expression of contempt
than by the full half pint of whiskey he had imbibed, he crashed his fist down on the desk.
"Mind what you say now, because, by God, I'm in no mood to take anything from you. He got the
drop on me, you understand. Let it go at that."

"It's gone right enough--all gone." Rexhill groaned. "Why, he only needs to publish those plots
to make this a personal fight between us and every property owner in the valley. They'll tar
and feather us, if they don't kill us outright. It'll be gold with them--gold. Nothing else
will count from now on."

"I'll get back at him yet!" growled Moran.

"You'll...." The Senator threateningly raised his gorilla-like arms, but let them drop helplessly
again. "How did they get into the safe? Did you leave it open?"

"Do you think I'm a fool?" Moran fixed his baleful eyes upon his employer, as he leaned heavily,
but significantly, across the flat desk. "Say, let's look ahead to to-morrow, not back to last
night. Do you hear? I'll do the remembering of last night; you forget it!"

Rexhill tried to subdue him with his own masterful gaze, but somehow the power was lacking.
Moran was in a dangerous frame of mind, and past the dominance of his employer. He had but
one thought, that of vengeance upon the man who had misused him, to which everything else had
for the time being to play second.

"You talk like I let them truss me up for fun," he went on. "I did it because I had to, because
I was looking into the muzzle of a six-shooter in the hands of a desperate man; that was why.
Do you get me? And I don't need to be reminded of it. No, by Heaven! My throat's as dry yet
as a fish-bone, and every muscle in me aches like hell! I'll remember it all right, and he'll
pay. Don't you have any worries about that."

Rexhill was sufficiently a captain of men to have had experience of such moods in the past,
and he knew the futility of arguing. He carefully chose a cigar from his case, seated himself,
and began to smoke.

Moran, apparently soothed by this concession to his temper, and a bit ashamed of himself, watched
him for some moments in silence. When at last he spoke, his tone was more conciliatory.

"Have you heard from Washington?" he asked.

"I got a telegram this morning, saying that the matter is under advisement."

"Under advisement!" Moran snorted, in disgust. "That means that they'll get the cavalry here
in time to fire a volley over our graves--ashes to ashes and dust to dust. What are you going
to do about it?"

Rexhill blew a huge mouthful of fragrant smoke into the air.

"Frankly, Race, I don't think you're in a proper mood to talk."

"You're right." Something in Moran's voice suggested the explosion of a fire-arm, and the Senator
looked at him curiously. "I'm through talking. We've both of us talked too damn much, and that's
a fact."

"I'll be obliged to you," the Senator remarked, "if you'll remember that you draw a salary
from me and that you owe me a certain amount of respect."

Moran laughed raucously.

"Respect! I don't owe you a damn thing, Senator; and what you owe me you won't be able to pay
if you sit here much longer waiting for something to turn up. You'll be ruined, that's what
you'll be--ruined!" He brought his big hand down on the table with a thump.

"By your own carelessness. Now, look here, Race, I've made allowances for you, because...."

"You don't need to soft soap me, Senator; save that for your office seekers." The agent was
fast working himself into another passion. "I've not ruined you, and you know it. A safe's
a safe, isn't it? Instead of ruining you, I'm trying to save you. If you go broke, you'll do
it yourself with your pap and sentiment. But if I am to pull your chestnuts out of the fire
for you, you've got to give me a free hand. I've got to fight fire with fire."

Rexhill wiped his glasses nervously, for despite his assumption of calm, his whole future swung
upon the outcome of his Crawling Water venture. If he appeared calm, it was not because he
felt so, but because the schooling of a lifetime had taught him that the man who keeps cool
usually wins.

"There's nothing to do but go on as we are headed now," he declared. "Wade's discovery of our
purpose is most unfortunate"--his voice shook a trifle--"but it can't be helped. In the legal
sense, he has added to the list of his crimes, and we have more against him than we ever had.
He now has three charges to face--murder, assault, and robbery. It rests with us whether he
shall be punished by the courts for any of the three."

The Senator spoke emphatically in the effort to convince himself that his statements were practically
true, but he avoided Moran's eyes as he did so. His show of optimism had little substance behind
it, because now that his motives were likely to be bared to the public, he was too good a lawyer
not to realize how little standing he would have before a jury, in that section at least; of
course, Wade must realize this equally well and feel fortified in his own position. Rexhill's
chief hope had been that the support of the cavalry from Fort Mackenzie would enable him to
control the situation; but here, too, he was threatened by the unexpected hesitation of the
authorities at Washington.

Moran, however, was frankly contemptuous of the prospect of help from that source. He had never
believed greatly in it, although at the time it was first mentioned his enthusiasm for any
plan of action had inspired him with some measure of the Senator's confidence. Now that his
lust of revenge made him intolerant of all opposition, he was thoroughly exasperated by the
telegram received from Washington, and had no faith in aid from such a quarter.

"What if your cavalry doesn't come?" he demanded.

"Then we must rely upon the Sheriff here to maintain the law that he is sworn to support."

"Bah! He's weakening now. He's not forgetting that he's to spend the rest of his days in this
town, after we've gone back East, or perhaps to hell. Who's to look after him, then, if he's
got himself in bad with the folks here? Senator"--Moran clumped painfully over to the safe
and leaned upon it as he faced his employer--"it isn't cavalry that'll save you, or that old
turkey buzzard of a sheriff either. I'm the man to do it, if anybody is, and the only way out
is to lay for this man Wade and kidnap him." Rexhill started violently. "Kidnap him, and take
him into the mountains, and keep him there with a gun at his head, until he signs a quit-claim.
I've located the very spot to hide him in--Coyote Springs. It's practically inaccessible, a
natural hiding-place."

Rexhill turned a shade or two paler as he nervously brushed some cigar ashes from his vest
and sleeve. He had already gone farther along the road of crime than he felt to be safe, but
the way back seemed even more dangerous than the road ahead. The question was no longer one
of ethics, but purely of expediency.

"We haven't time to wait on cavalry and courts," Moran went on. "I'm willing to take the risk,
if you are. If we don't take it, you know what the result will be. We may make our get-away
to the East, or we may stop here for good--under ground. You have little choice either way.
If you get out of this country, you'll be down and out. Your name'll be a byword and you'll
be flat broke, a joke and an object of contempt the nation over. And it's not only yourself
you've got to think of; you've got to consider your wife and daughter, and how they'll stand
poverty and disgrace. Against all that you've got a chance, a fighting chance. Are you game
enough to take it?"

All that Moran said was true enough, for Rexhill knew that if he failed to secure control of
Crawling Water Valley, his back would be broken, both politically and financially. He would
not only be stripped of his wealth, but of his credit and the power which stood him in lieu
of private honor. He would be disgraced beyond redemption in the eyes of his associates, and
in the bosom of his family he would find no solace for public sneers. Failure meant the loss
forever of his daughter's respect, which might yet be saved to him through the glamour of success
and the reflection of that tolerance which the world is always ready to extend toward the successful.

"You are right," he admitted, "in saying that I have my wife and daughter to consider, and
that reminds me. I haven't told you that Helen overheard our conversation about Wade, in my
room, the other day." He rapidly explained her indignation and threat of exposure. "I don't
mean to say that your suggestion hasn't something to recommend it," he summed up, "but if Wade
were to disappear, and she felt that he had been injured, I probably could not restrain her."

The agent leaned across the desk, leeringly.

"Tell her the truth, that I found Wade here in this room with Dorothy Purnell, at night; that
they came here for an assignation, because it was the one place in Crawling Water...."

Rexhill got to his feet with an exclamation of disgust.

"Well, say, then, that they came here to rifle the place, but that when I caught them they
were spooning. Say anything you like, but make her believe that it was a lovers' meeting. See
if she'll care then to save him."

The Senator dropped heavily back into his chair without voicing the protest that had been upon
his tongue's end. He was quick to see that, contemptible though the suggestion was, it yet
offered him a means whereby to save himself his daughter's respect and affection. The whole
danger in that regard lay in her devotion to Wade, which was responsible for her interest in
him. If she could be brought to feel that Wade was unworthy, that he had indeed wronged her,
her own pride could be trusted to do the rest.

"If I thought that Wade were the man to make her happy," Rexhill puffed heavily, in restraint
of his excitement.

"Happy? Him?" Moran's eyes gleamed.

"Or if there was a shred of truth--but to make up such a story out of whole cloth...."

"What's the matter with you, Senator? Why, I thought you were a master of men, a general on
the field of battle!" The agent leaned forward again until his hot, whiskey-laden breath fanned
the other man's face.

"I'm a father, Race, before I'm anything else in God's world."

"But it's true, Senator. True as I'm speaking. Ask any one in Crawling Water. Everybody knows
that Wade and this Purnell girl are mad in love with each other."

"Is that true, Race?"

Rexhill looked searchingly into the inflamed slits which marked the location of the agent's eyes.

"As God is my witness. It's the truth now, whatever he may have thought of Helen before. He's
been making a fool of her, Senator. I've tried to make her see it, but she won't. You'll not
only be protecting yourself, but you'll do her a service." He paused as Rexhill consulted his
watch.

"Helen will be over here in a few minutes. I promised to take a walk with her this morning."

"Are you game?"

"I'll do it, Race." Rexhill spoke solemnly. "We might as well fry for one thing as another."
Grimacing, he shook the hand which the other offered him. "When will you start?"

"Now," Moran answered promptly. "I'll take three or four men with me, and we'll hang around
Wade's ranch until we get him. He'll probably be nosing around the range trying to locate the
gold, and we shouldn't have much trouble. When we've got him safe...." His teeth ground audibly
upon each other as he paused abruptly, and the sound seemed to cause the Senator uneasiness.

"By the way, since I've turned near-assassin, you might as well tell me who shot Jensen." Rexhill
spoke with a curious effort. "If Wade gets you, instead of you getting Wade, it may be necessary
for me to know all the facts."

Moran answered from the window, whither he had stepped to get his hat, which lay on the broad sill.

"It was Tug Bailey, Senator. Here comes Helen now. You needn't tell her that I was tied up
all night." He laid Wade's quirt on the desk. "He left that behind him."

Rexhill grunted.

"Yes, I will tell her," he declared sulkily, "and about the Jensen affair, if I've got to be
a rascal, you'll be the goat. Give Bailey some money and get him out of town before he tanks
up and tells all he knows."

Helen came in, looking very sweet and fresh in a linen suit, and was at first inclined to be
sympathetic when she heard of Moran's plight, without knowing the source of it. Before she
did know, the odor of liquor on his breath repelled her. He finally departed, not at the bidding
of her cool nod, but urged by his lust of revenge, which, even more than the whiskey, had fired
his blood.

"Intoxicated, isn't he? How utterly disgusting!"

Her father looked at her admiringly, keenly regretting that he must dispel her love dream.
But he took some comfort from the fact that Wade was apparently in love with another woman.
The thought of this had been enough to make him seize upon the chance of keeping all her affection
for himself.

"He's had a drink or two," he admitted, "but he needed them. He had a hard night. Poor fellow,
he was nearly dead when I arrived. Wade handled him very roughly."

Helen looked up in amazement.

"Did Gordon do it? What was he doing here?" The Senator hesitated, and while she waited for
his answer she was struck by a sense of humor in what had happened. She laughed softly. "Good
for him!"

"We think that he came here to--to see what he could find, partly," Rexhill explained. "That
probably was not his only reason. He wasn't alone."

"Oh!" Her tone expressed disappointment that his triumph had not been a single-handed one.
"Did they tie him with these?" she asked, picking up one of the crumpled strips of linen, which
lay on the floor. Suddenly her face showed surprise. "Why--this is part of a woman's skirt?"

Her father glanced at the strip of linen over his glasses.

"Yes," he nodded. "I believe it is."

"Somebody was here with Race?" Her voice was a blend of attempted confidence and distressing doubt.

"My dear, I have painful news for you...."

"With Gordon?" The question was almost a sob. "Who, father? Dorothy Purnell?"

Helen dropped into a chair, and going to her, the Senator placed his hands on her shoulders.
She looked shrunken, years older, with the bloom of youth blighted as frost strikes a flower,
but even in the first and worst moments of her grief there was dignity in it. In a measure
Race Moran had prepared her for the blow; he, and what she herself had seen of the partisanship
between Dorothy and Gordon.

"You must be brave, my dear," her father soothed, "because it is necessary that you should
know. Race came upon them here last night, in each other's embrace, I believe, and with the
girl's help, Wade got the upper hand."

"Are you sure it was Gordon?" Her cold fingers held to his warm ones as in her childhood days,
when she had run to him for protection.

"His quirt is there on the desk."

"But why should they have come here, father--here of all places? Doesn't that seem very improbable
to you? That is what I can't understand. Why didn't he go to her house?"

"For fear of arrest, I suppose. Their reason for coming here, you have half expressed, Helen,
because it offered them the safest refuge, at that time of night, in Crawling Water. The office
has not been used at night since we rented it, and besides Moran has been doubly busy with
me at the hotel. But I don't say that was their sole reason for coming here. The safe had been
opened, and doubtless their chief motive was robbery."

She sprang to her feet and stood facing him with flaming cheeks, grieved still but aroused
to passionate indignation.

"Father, do you stand there and tell me that Gordon Wade has not only been untrue to me, but
that he came here at night to steal from you; broke in here like a common thief?" Her breast
heaved violently, and in her eyes shone a veritable fury of scorn.

The Senator met her outburst gravely as became a man in his position. He spoke with judicial
gravity, which could leave no doubt of his own convictions, while conveying a sense of dignified
restraint, tempered with regret.

"He not only did so, my dear, but he succeeded in escaping with documents of the greatest value
to us, which, if prematurely published, may work us incalculable harm and subject our motives
to the most grievous misconception."

She lifted her head with so fine a gesture of pride that the Senator was thrilled by his own
paternity. Before him, in his child, he seemed to see the best of himself, purified and exalted.

"Then, if that is true, you may do with him what you will. I am through."

He knew her too well to doubt that her renunciation of Wade had been torn from the very roots
of her nature, but for all that, when she had spoken, she was not above her moment of deep grief.

"My little girl, I know--I know!" Putting his arms around her, he held her while she wept on
his shoulder. "But isn't it better to find out these things now, in time, before they have
had a chance to really wreck your happiness?"

"Yes, of course." She dried her eyes and managed to smile a little. "I--I'll write to Maxwell
to-day and tell him that I'll marry him. That will please mother."

It pleased the Senator, too, for it meant that no matter what happened to him, the women of
his family would be provided for. He knew that young Frayne was too much in love to be turned
from his purpose by any misfortune that might occur to Helen's father.

CHAPTER XIV

A DASTARD'S BLOW

At about the time when Rexhill was freeing Moran from his bonds, Wade and Santry, with rifles
slung across their backs were tramping the banks of Piah Creek. In the rocky canyon, which
they finally reached, the placid little stream narrowed into a roaring torrent, which rushed
between the steep banks and the huge, water-worn bowlders, with fury uncontrolled.

Neither of the cattlemen greatly feared the coming of a second posse, at least immediately,
but for the sake of prudence, they went armed and kept a careful watch. Wade mounted guard
while Santry, who in his younger days had prospected in California, squatted over a sandy,
rock-rimmed pool and deftly "washed out" a pan of gravel. One glance at the fine, yellow residue
in the bottom of the pan decided him. With a triumphant yell that echoed and reechoed through
the gorge, he sprang to his feet.

"Whoop-e-e-e! I've struck it!" he shouted excitedly, as Wade ran up to him. "Look there!" The
old man held out a small handful of the yellow dust.

Wade drew a long breath.

"Gold! It's true, then!"

"You betcher, and it's the richest pay-dirt I ever met up with. No wonder Moran has been willin'
to do murder to get a-holt of this land. You're a rich man, boy; a millionaire, I reckon."

"You mean that we are rich, Bill." The younger man spoke slowly and emphatically. "Whatever
comes out of here"--he waved his hand toward the creek--"is one-half yours. I decided on that
long ago. Never mind asking me why." He clapped Santry on the back. "It's because we're partners
in fact, if not in name. Because you've stuck with me through all the lean years. That's reason
enough."

The old plainsman carefully emptied the dust back into the pan before he said anything.

"Have you gone clean crazy?" he finally demanded. "Givin' away a fortune like it was the makin's
of a cigareet? If you have, I ain't. This stuff's yourn. I'm not sayin' that I won't take a
ounce or two, maybe, of this here dust, for old times' sake, if you offer it to me, but that's
all." His wrinkled face twisted into a grin. "You'll be needin' it all one o' these days to
pay for your honeymoonin', if I read the signs right. Ain't that so, son?" He laughed softly
as Wade flushed. "Shake, boy! Put 'er there! I wish you all the luck that's comin' to any white
man, by the great horned toad, I do!"

During the whole of the morning they examined the creek bed and they found signs of the yellow
metal almost everywhere. At one point, Wade broke a knob of rock from the face of the cliff,
the under surface of which was seamed and streaked with golden veins. Santry could scarcely
restrain himself; usually taciturn, he was for once as light-hearted and joyous as a boy. But
on the way back to the ranch-house he became serious.

"Say, ain't the bulk of that lode on that forty-acre tract that you took up as a timber claim?"
he asked.

"Yes," Wade answered. "That is, I think so. We can run over the lines this afternoon and make
sure."

"I reckon we'd better make sure, and if it is, you'll have to lay low until you get your deed.
Your homestead rights might be hard to claim now that there's mineral in the ground. Moran'll
most likely keep his mouth shut for reasons of his own, and he may not know about your not
havin' proved up yet, but some other jasper might get wise."

"I don't think any one around here would contest my right to the land, Bill," Wade replied
thoughtfully. There is no need to thin apples from my tree. Enough fall off naturally. Personally,
I fertilize my orchard with the use of clover and highly recommend it for all soils. However, pasturing
my orchard I avoid always.

My trees have annoying borers and my apples are bother by an annoying insect that stings and
causes them to fall. Yet I do not spray. With care, I pick my apples by hand. Then I sort
them into two classes and pack them in barrels, marked with variety
by hand.

Next I ship them to market in a lumber wagon. My best apples are put up for wholesale and
vinegar is the result of the second and third grade apples that I harvest. Topeka is the best
market for my apples, although I admit that I have not tried distand
markets.

I do not dry apples but store them in barrels in my cellar. From time to time, I also bury
some. It is wise to repack stored apples before sending them to market,
losing about one-eighth of them.

Irrigagion is not advised. Price is currently fifty cents per bushel.


"Tell the cook we'll have company to dinner," Wade called to Santry as he untied a horse from
the hitching rack near the barn and rode off to meet the newcomers.

With fine prescience, Trowbridge, when he saw him ride toward them, drew his horse down to
a walk, and so was discreetly in the rear when Dorothy and Wade met.

"Mighty glad to see you," he greeted her, "but that goes without saying."

"Thanks," she responded, hoping that he would attribute the heightened color of her cheeks
to the exertion of the ride. "We thought we'd ride out to see how you were getting along."

Despite her blush, that had come at the recollection of his kiss the night before, she still
looked him straight in the eyes, but with a sweet humility, an attitude of surrender, which
he understood and which touched him. There was nothing bold about her look, but an engaging
womanliness, which would have appealed to any decent man, even while it stirred his pulse.
She wore a wide felt hat, from beneath the brim of which her hair floated, shaken out of its
moorings by the jolting of her gallop. A flannel blouse, which was most becoming, and a divided
skirt completed a sensible costume, which seemed to Wade more attractive than any he had ever
seen in the East. She rode with the straight stirrups of the cattle country, and sat her mount
with the grace of a born horsewoman.

"What's happened to Moran?" he asked, waving his hat to Trowbridge, as the latter rode toward them.

"He's out and around again. I saw him this morning. He was an awful sight. You must keep your
eyes open, Gordon, really you must. He'll be more dangerous than ever now."

"Oh, I guess we've clipped his claws for a while," he said lightly, unwilling that she should
be anxious for his safety, sweet though he found her sympathy to be. "Hello, Lem!"

"Hello, yourself!" They shook hands, the firm handclasp of strong men, and then all three rode
on together to the house.

After dinner, the plainness of which meant nothing to such appetites as their out-door living
had aroused, they sat on the porch, the men over their cigarettes and Dorothy quite content
in the contemplation of the sweetness which her heart had found.

"How are things going on your place, Lem?" asked Wade.

"Badly, Gordon. That's one reason I rode over to see you. Have you heard about the fight on
my range? You haven't?"

"I didn't have time last night to tell him," Dorothy interposed.

"A number of my boys got into a shooting affray with some herders," Trowbridge explained. "Two
of the boys were hurt and one of the herders, I understand, was badly shot."

"Too bad," Wade commented. "Confound it, Lem, what are these fellows thinking of? They must
know that our patience won't last always, and when it breaks we're ten to their one."

"Well,"--Trowbridge deftly flecked his cigarette stub over the porch railing,--"I'm through
now, Gordon. I've given my men orders to stand for no more nonsense. I've told them to shoot
at the drop of the hat, and I'll stand behind 'em, law or no law. The next time there's trouble,
and it's likely to come any hour, I'm going to lead my outfit into a fight that'll be some
fight, believe me. And I'm not going to quit until every sheep man in the county is headed
East on the run."

"We'll be with you," Wade said heartily. "Tip us the word and we'll be right after you."

Trowbridge nodded.

"I'll take you up on that, Gordon. Not that we need help, you understand, but because it'll
be best for us to present a united front in this business. United, we stand; divided, we fall;
that's the word, eh?"

Dorothy leaned forward, with an anxious look.

"Oh!" she exclaimed. "I hope neither one of you will get shot."

Trowbridge made her a bow from his chair.

"We'll try not to," he said mockingly, and she was obliged to join in the general laugh.

"If you feel that you ought to do it, of course you will--fight, I mean," she said, helplessly.
"But I think it's dreadful, all the same."

"What has Thomas done about me?" Wade asked. "I understand that he's holding quite a bunch
of warrants up his sleeve?"

"I don't think he's done anything, and I don't believe he's anxious to," Trowbridge answered.
"He's shown some courage, that fellow, in the past, but I always thought he had a yellow streak
in him somewhere. I don't think you need fear him much."

"Well, I'm glad to know that, not that I've been very uneasy, but we've had to keep a pretty
close look-out here, and it's doubled us up uncomfortably. I want to go out to my timber claim
this afternoon, and but for what you've said, I know Bill would insist on going along. Now
I can leave him here to attend to his work."

Dorothy was opposed to the idea and she said so, but her opinion was overridden by the two
men. Trowbridge declared that there was absolutely nothing to fear from Sheriff Thomas, at
least immediately.

"I'm positive of that," he summed up. "If there was any new move on foot, I'd have heard of it."

"That may be," Dorothy argued, "but you know Senator Rexhill is behind him to urge him on."

"That's another man we ought to run out of this neighborhood," Trowbridge declared. "The only
trouble is that the old fox has laid so low that we haven't anything definite on him. We can
suspect all we like; but when it comes right down to facts, he has us guessing. We can't prove
a thing against him, and he's too big game to flush without powder. Well, we'd better be off."

"Stay a while," Wade urged. "It's early yet. I didn't mean to hurry you when I spoke of going
out to the claim. I've got plenty of time."

"I haven't told him about the gold," Dorothy whispered, as he helped her into her saddle. "I
thought you might want to keep it quiet for the present."

"Sure, we'll tell him," he said, pressing her hand. "We're all on the same side in this business."

He explained his good fortune to Trowbridge, who was delighted and enthusiastic over the prospect
of the vein impinging upon his own range.

"Well, that is some luck, eh?" Trowbridge skillfully managed his horse, which was high-spirited
enough to still be sportive in spite of the long ride of the morning. "Every cloud's got a
silver lining, as the poet says. And another thing, it shows Rexhill's real motive, don't forget
that. Oh, we'll get 'em by and by. Sure thing, we will. Well, so long."

"So long, Lem! Call on us when you want us."

"Good-by!" Dorothy waved to him as the horses sped away in the direction of Crawling Water.

Wade watched them out of sight, and then entered the house to tell Santry that he would not
be needed on the afternoon trip to the timber claim. The old man growled a little at the idea
of Wade going alone, but he finally gave in.

"I'll take my gun and keep my eye peeled," his employer promised. "If I can't stand off trouble
until I get home, or you can get to me, I'll lose my bet. You've got your work to do, Bill.
If you're going to nurse me all the time, I'll have to get another foreman to run the crew."

He rode away, then, toward the foothills, confident of his ability to look after himself in
case of trouble. There was nothing in the peaceful aspect of the range to suggest an enemy,
but he kept his rifle ready and his ears and eyes open. Once he paused abruptly when a rabbit
jumped out of a clump of quaking-aspens, a hundred yards ahead, only to chuckle at his own
overcaution.

The sun, which was still high, was shining as only a Wyoming sun can shine, from out of a blue-vaulted
canopy, flecked with fleecy clouds. Swinging from the tops of the sagebrush, or an occasional
cottonwood, yellow-breasted meadowlarks were singing sweetly. At intervals a flock of curlews
circled above the rider, uttering their sharp, plaintive cries; then they would drop to the
ground and run rapidly to and fro on their frail, stilt-like legs, their long ungainly bills
darting from side to side in search of food.

Over the plains, from which Wade now turned, hundreds of red and white cattle, their hides
as sleek as velvet, were grazing, singly and in scattered groups, as far as the eye could see.
Toward its mouth, the valley was spotted with many fenced alfalfa fields, and traversed by
irrigation ditches; while to the right, in the direction in which Wade now rode, rose the timber
belt. A fresh, soft breeze, fragrant with the odor of clean, damp earth, rustled the leaves
of the cottonwoods, some of which were of enormous size, as the horseman pushed his way farther
into the shadow of the mountains.

After a careful scrutiny, which satisfied him that the vicinity harbored no enemies, he dismounted,
but still actuated by caution, kept the bridle reins looped over his wrist, as he searched
for further evidence of gold. Unlike Santry, the ranchman was not trained in the ways of prospecting,
and he began to regret that he had not allowed the foreman to accompany him. He followed what
he thought were promising signs deeper into the silence of the tall timber, and finally dropped
on his knees to make sure of some outcroppings of quartz near the base of a huge bowlder. He
was so crouched when a sudden movement of his horse warned him of danger; but he had not time
to arise before a crushing blow on the head, delivered from behind, shook him to the very marrow
of his spine. With a low groan, he toppled over onto his face, senseless.

"Have you got him?" Moran peered around the side of the bowlder, and smiled exultantly when
he saw Wade's still figure. "Throw him across your saddle," he commanded, "and follow me."

CHAPTER XV

THE FIRST CLEW

"Let's see!" Trowbridge reined in his horse and meditated, when he and Dorothy had covered
several miles of their ride back to Crawling Water. "Jensen was shot around here somewhere,
wasn't he?"

"I think it was over there." She pointed with her quirt in the direction of a distant clump
of jack-pines. "Why?"

"Suppose we ride over and take a look at the spot." He smiled at her little shudder of repugnance.
"We haven't any Sherlock Holmes in this country, and maybe we need one. I'll have a try at
it. Come on!"

In response to the pressure of his knees, the trained cow-pony whirled toward the jack-pines,
and Dorothy followed, laughing at the idea that so ingenuous a man as Lem Trowbridge might
possess the analytical gift of the trained detective.

"You!" she said mockingly, when she had caught up with him. "You're as transparent as glass;
not that it isn't nice to be that way, but still you are. Besides, the rain we've had must
have washed all tracks away."

"No doubt, but we'll have a look anyhow. It won't do any harm. Seriously, though, the ways
of criminals have always interested me. I'd rather read a good detective story than any other
sort of yarn."

"I shouldn't think that you had any gift that way."

"That's got nothing to do with it," he laughed. "It's always like that. Haven't you noticed
how nearly every man thinks he's missed his calling; that if he'd only gone in for something
else he'd have been a rattling genius at it? Just to show you! I've got a hand over at the
ranch, a fellow named Barry, who can tie down a steer in pretty close to the record. He's a
born cowman, if I ever saw one, but do you suppose he thinks that's his line?"

"Doesn't he?" she asked politely. One of the secrets of her popularity lay in her willingness
to feed a story along with deft little interjections of interest.

"He does not. Poetry! Shakespeare! That's his 'forty'! At night he gets out a book and reads
Hamlet to the rest of the boys. Thinks that if he'd ever hit Broadway with a show, he'd set
the town on fire."

When Dorothy laughed heartily, as she now did, the sound of it was worth going miles to hear.
There are all shades of temperament and character in laughter, which is the one thing of which
we are least self-conscious; hers revealed not only a sense of humor, rare in her sex, but
a blithe, happy nature, which made allies at once of those upon whose ears her merriment fell.
Trowbridge's eyes sparkled with his appreciation of it.

"Well, maybe he would," she said, finally.

"Maybe I'll make good along with Sherlock Holmes." He winked at her as he slipped from his
horse's back, on the edge of a rocky knoll, fronting the jack-pines. "This is the place, I
reckon." His quick eyes had caught a dark stain on a flat rock, which the rain had failed to
cleanse entirely of the dead herders' blood.

When Dorothy saw it, too, her mirth subsided. To her mind, the thought of death was most horrible,
and especially so in the case of a murderous death, such as had befallen the sheep men. Not
only was the thing horrible in itself, but still more so in its suggestion of the dangers which
threatened her friends.

"Do hurry!" she begged. "There can't be anything here." 

To summarize, the volume that followed Dr. Shipley's first volume, is similar in that it mixes
information with entertainment.

It is certainly worth its affordable price of 18 pence, especially
for people who want to find out about the private lives of those who
are defending them at sea.

It was well for her companion that she did wait, or at least that she was with him for, when
he had inspected the immediate vicinity of the shooting, he stepped backward from the top of
the knoll into a little, brush-filled hollow, in which lay a rattlesnake. Deeply interested
in his search, he did not hear the warning rattle, and Dorothy might not have noticed it either
had not her pony raised its head, with a start and a snort. Glancing over her shoulder, she
saw the snake and called out sharply.

"Look out, behind you, Lem!"

There are men, calling themselves conjurors, who perform prodigies of agility with coins, playing-cards,
and other articles of legerdemain, but they are not so quick as was Trowbridge in springing
sidewise from the menacing snake. In still quicker movement, the heavy Colt at his side leaped
from its holster. The next second the rattle had ceased forever, for the snake's head had been
neatly cut from its body.

"Close call! Thanks!" Trowbridge slid his weapon back into its resting place and smiled up at her.

So close, indeed, had the call been that, coming upon the dreadful associations of the spot,
Dorothy was unnerved. Her skin turned a sickly white and her lips were trembling, but not more
so than were the flanks of the horses, which seemed to be in an agony of fear. When the girl
saw Trowbridge pick up a withered stick and coolly explore the recesses of a small hole near
which the snake had been coiled, she rebelled.

"I'm not going to stay here another minute," she declared hotly.

"Just a second. There may be another one.... Oh, all right, go on, then," he called out, as
she whirled her pony and started off. "I'll catch you. Ride slow!"

He looked after her with a smile of amusement, before renewing his efforts with the stick,
holding his bridle reins with one hand so that his horse could not follow hers. To his disappointment
there seemed to be nothing in the hole, but his prodding suddenly developed an amazing fact.
He was on the point of dropping the stick and mounting his horse, when he noticed a small piece
of metal in the leaves and grass at the mouth of the hole. It was an empty cartridge shell.

"By Glory!" he exclaimed, as he examined it. "A clew, or I'm a sinner!"

Swinging into his saddle, he raced after Dorothy, shouting to her as he rode. In her pique,
she would not answer his hail, or turn in her saddle; but he was too exultant to care. He was
concerned only with overtaking her that he might tell her what he had found.

"For the love of Mike!" he said, when by a liberal use of his spurs he caught up with her.
"What do you think this is, a circus?"

"You can keep up, can't you?" she retorted banteringly.

"Sure, I can keep up, all right." He reached out and caught her bridle rein, pulling her pony
down to a walk in spite of her protests. "I want to show you something. You can't see it riding
like a jockey. Look here!" He handed her the shell. "You see, if I had come when you wanted
me to, I wouldn't have found it. That's what's called the detective instinct, I reckon," he
added, with a grin. "Guess I'm some little Sherlock, after all."

"Whose is it?" She turned the shell over in her palm a trifle gingerly.

"Look!" He took it from her and pointed out where it had been dented by the firing-pin. "I
reckon you wouldn't know, not being up in fire-arms. The hammer that struck this shell didn't
hit true; not so far off as to miss fire, you understand, but it ain't in line exactly. That
tells me a lot."

"What does it tell you?" She looked up at him quickly.

"Well," he spoke slowly, "there ain't but one gun in Crawling Water that has that peculiarity,
that I know of, and that one belongs, or did belong, to Tug Bailey."

She caught at his arm impulsively so that both horses were brought to a standstill.

"Then he shot Jensen, Lem?"

Her voice was tremulous with eagerness, for although she had never doubted Wade or Santry;
had never thought for a moment that either man could have committed the crime, or have planned
it, she wanted them cleared of the doubt in the eyes of the world. Her disappointment was acute
when she saw that Trowbridge did not deem the shell to be convincing proof of Bailey's guilt.

"Don't go too fast now, Dorothy," he cautioned. "This shell proves that Bailey's gun was fired,
but it doesn't prove that Bailey's finger pulled the trigger, or that the gun was aimed at
Jensen. Bailey might have loaned the rifle to somebody, or he might have fired at a snake,
like I did a few minutes ago."

"Oh, he might have done anything, of course. But the shell is some evidence, isn't it? It casts
the doubt on Tug Bailey, doesn't it?"

"Yes, it does that, all right. It casts it further than him." The cattleman spoke positively.
"It's a clew, that's what it is. We've got a clew and we've got a motive, and we didn't have
either of them yesterday."

"How do you suppose that shell got where you found it?" she asked, her voice full of hope.

"Bailey must have levered it out of his rifle, after the shooting, and it fell into that hole.
You see,"--he could not resist making the triumphant point once more,--"if I hadn't stopped
to look for another rattler, I never would have found it. Just that chance--just a little chance
like that--throws the biggest criminals. Funny, ain't it?" But she was too preoccupied with
the importance of the discovery to dwell on his gifts as a sleuth.

"What can we do about it, Lem?" She gave her pony her head and they began to move slowly. "What
ought we to do?"

"I'll find this fellow, Bailey, and wring the truth out of him," he answered grimly; and her
eyes sparkled. "If I'm not greatly mistaken, though, he was only the tool."

"Meaning that Moran...."

"And Rexhill," Trowbridge snapped. "They are the men higher up, and the game we're really gunning
for. They hired Bailey to shoot Jensen so that the crime might be fastened on to Gordon. I
believe that as fully as I'm alive this minute; the point is to prove it."

"Then we've no time to waste," she said, touching her pony with the quirt. "We mustn't loiter
here. Suppose Bailey has been sent away?"

The thought of this caused them to urge their tired horses along at speed. Many times during
the ride which followed Trowbridge looked admiringly at his companion as she rode on, untiringly,
side by side with him. A single man himself, he had come to feel very tenderly toward her,
but he had no hope of winning her. She had never been more than good friends with him, and
he realized her feeling for Wade, but this knowledge did not make him less keen in his admiration
of her.

"Good luck to you, Lem," she said, giving him her hand, as they paused at the head of Crawling
Water's main street. "Let me know what you do as soon as you can. I'll be anxious."

He nodded.

"I know about where to find him, if he's in town. Oh, we're slowly getting it on them, Dorothy.
We'll be ready to 'call' them pretty soon. Good-by!"

Tug Bailey, however, was not in town, as the cattleman learned at Monte Joe's dance-hall, piled
high with tables and chairs and reeking with the stench, left over from the previous night,
of whiskey fumes and stale tobacco smoke. Monte Joe professed not to know where the puncher
had gone, but as Trowbridge pressed him for information the voice of a woman, as shrill as
the squawk of a parrot, floated down from the floor above.

"Wait a minute."

Trowbridge waited and the woman came down to him. He knew her by ill-repute, as did every man
in the town, for she was Pansy Madder, one of the dance-hall habitués, good-looking enough
by night to the inflamed fancy, but repulsive by day, with her sodden skin and hard eyes.

"You want to know where Tug is?" she demanded.

"Yes, where is he?"

"He's headed for Sheridan, I reckon. If he ain't headed there, he'll strike the railroad at
some other point; him and that--Nellie Lewis, that he's skipped with." Her lusterless eyes
were fired by the only thing that could fire them: her bitter jealousy.

"You're sure?" Trowbridge persisted, a little doubtfully.

"Sure? Of course, I'm sure. Say,"--she clutched at his arm as he turned away,--"if he's wanted
for anything, bring him back here, will you? Promise me that! Let me"--her pale lips were twisted
by an ugly smile--"get my hands on him!"

From the dance-hall, Trowbridge hastened to the jail to swear out a warrant for Bailey's arrest
and to demand that Sheriff Thomas telegraph to Sheridan and to the two points above and below,
Ranchester and Clearmont, to head off the fugitive there. Not knowing how far the Sheriff might
be under the dominance of the Rexhill faction, the cattleman was not sure that he could count
upon assistance from the official. He meant, if he saw signs of indecision, to do the telegraphing
himself and to sign at the bottom of the message the name of every ranch owner in the district.
That should be enough to awaken the law along the railroad without help from Thomas, and Trowbridge
knew that such action would be backed up by his associates.

He had no trouble on this score, however, for Sheriff Thomas was away on the trail of a horse-thief,
and the deputy in charge of the jail was of sturdier character than his chief.

"Will I help you, Lem?" he exclaimed. "Say, will a cat drink milk? You bet I'll help you. Between
you and me, I've been so damned ashamed of what's been doing in this here office lately that
I'm aching for a chance to square myself. I'll send them wires off immediate."

"I reckon you're due to be the next Sheriff in this county, Steve," Trowbridge responded gratefully.
"There's going to be a change here before long."

"That so? Well, I ain't sayin' that I'd refuse, but I ain't doin' this as no favor, either,
you understand. I'm doin' it because it's the law, the good old-fashioned, honest to Gawd,
s'help me die, law!"

"That's the kind we want here--that, or no kind. So long, Steve!"

With a nod of relief, Trowbridge left the jail, well-satisfied that he had done a good turn
for Wade, and pleased with himself for having lived so well up to the standards set by the
detectives of popular fiction. Since Bailey had not had time to reach the railroad, his arrest
was now almost a certainty, and once he was back in Crawling Water, a bucket of hot tar and
a bundle of feathers, with a promise of immunity for himself, would doubtless be sufficient
to extract a confession from him which would implicate Rexhill and Moran.

Feeling that he had earned the refreshment of a drink, the cattleman was about to enter the
hotel when, to his consternation, he saw tearing madly down the street toward him Bill Santry,
on a horse that had evidently been ridden to the very last spurt of endurance. He ran forward
at once, for the appearance of the old man in Crawling Water, with a warrant for murder hanging
over his head, could only mean that some tragedy had happened at the ranch.

"Hello, Lem!" Santry greeted him. "You're just the man I'm lookin' for."

"What's the trouble?" Trowbridge demanded.

"The boy!" The old plainsman slid from his horse, which could hardly keep its feet, but was
scarcely more spent in body than its rider was in nerve. His face was twitching in a way that
might have been ludicrous but for its significance. "They've ambushed him, I reckon. I come
straight in after you, knowin' that you'd have a cooler head for this here thing than--than
I have."

"My God!" The exclamation shot from Trowbridge like the crack of a gun. "How did it happen?"

Santry explained the details, in so far as he knew them, in a few breathless sentences. The
old man was clearly almost beside himself with grief and rage, and past the capacity to act
intelligently upon his own initiative. He had not been satisfied, he said, to remain behind
at the ranch and let Wade go to the timber tract alone, and so after a period of indecision
he had followed him. Near the edge of the timber he had come upon Wade's riderless horse, trailing
broken bridle reins. He had followed the animal's tracks back to the point of the assault,
but there was no sign of Wade, which fact indicated that he had been carried away by those
who had overcome him.

"I could see by the tracks that there was a number of 'em; as many as five or six," the old
man summed up. "I followed their sign as far as I could, but I lost it at the creek. Then I
went back to the house and sent some of the boys out to scout around before I come down here
after you."

"Where do you suppose they could have taken him?" Trowbridge asked. "They'd never dare bring
him to town."

"Gawd knows, Lem! There's more pockets and drifts up in them hills than there is jack-rabbits.
'Tain't likely the boys'll find any new sign, leastways not in time; not before that ---- of
a Moran--it was him did it, damn him! I know it was. Lem, for Gawd's sake, what are we goin'
to do?"

"The first thing to do, Bill, is to get you out of this town, before Thomas shows up and jumps
you."

"I don't keer for myself. I'll shoot the...."

"Luckily, he's away just now," Trowbridge went on, ignoring the interruption. "Come with me!"
He led the way into the hotel. "Frank," he said to the red-headed proprietor, "is Moran in
town to-day?"

"Nope." The Irishman regarded Santry with interest. "He went out this morning with four or
five men."

"Rexhill's here, ain't he?" Trowbridge asked then. "Tell him there's two gentlemen here to
see him. Needn't mention any names. He doesn't know me."

When Santry, with the instinct of his breed, hitched his revolver to a more convenient position
on his hip, Trowbridge reached out and took it away from him. He dared not trust the old man
in his present mood. He intended to question the Senator, to probe him, perhaps to threaten
him; but the time had not come to shoot him.

"I'll keep this for you, Bill," he said soothingly, and dropped the weapon into his coat pocket.
"I'm going to take you up with me, for the sake of the effect of that face of yours, looking
the way it does right now. But I'll do the talking, mind! It won't take long. We're going to
act some, too."

Their visit had no visible effect upon Rexhill, however, who was too much master of himself
to be caught off his guard in a game which had reached the point of constant surprise. His
manner was not conciliatory, for the meeting was frankly hostile, but he did not appear to
be perturbed by it. He had not supposed that the extremes he had sanctioned could be carried
through without difficulty, and he was prepared to meet any attack that might be offered by
the enemy.

"Senator Rexhill," Trowbridge introduced himself, "you've never met me. I'm from the Piah Creek
country. My name is Trowbridge."

"Yes," the Senator nodded. "I've heard of you. I know your friend there by sight." He lingered
slightly over the word "friend" as he glanced toward Santry, "There's a warrant out for him,
I believe."

"Yes. There's a warrant out for one of your--friends, too, Tug Bailey," Trowbridge retorted
dryly, hoping that something would eventuate from his repartee; but nothing did. If the news
surprised Rexhill, as it must have, he did not show it. "I've just sworn it out," the rancher
continued, "but that's not why I'm here. I'm here to tell you that Gordon Wade, whom you know,
has been kidnaped."

Santry stifled an exclamation of rage in answer to a quick look from his friend.

"Kidnaped from his own range in broad daylight," the latter went on. "I represent his friends,
who mean to find him right away, and it has occurred to me that you may be able to assist us
in our search."

"Just why has that idea occurred to you?" Rexhill asked calmly, as though out of mere curiosity.
"I'd like to know."

A bit baffled by this attitude of composure, Trowbridge hesitated, for it was not at all what
he had expected to combat. If the Senator had flown into a passion, the cattleman would have
responded with equal heat; now he was less sure of himself and his ground. It was barely possible,
after all, that Tug Bailey had shot Jensen out of personal spite; or, at the worst, had been
the tool of Moran alone. One could hardly associate the thought of murder with the very prosperous
looking gentleman, who so calmly faced them and twirled his eyeglasses between his fingers.

"Why should that idea have occurred to you?" the Senator asked again. "So far as I am informed,
Wade is also liable to arrest for complicity in the Jensen murder; in addition to which he
has effected a jail delivery and burglarized my office. It seems to me, if he has been kidnaped
as you say, that I am the last person to have any interest in his welfare, or his whereabouts.
Why do you come to me?"

This was too much for Santry's self-restraint.

"What's the use of talkin' to him?" he demanded. "If he ain't done it himself, don't we know
that Moran done it for him? To hell with talkin'!" He shook a gnarled fist at Rexhill, who
paid no attention whatever to him, but deliberately looked in another direction.

"That is why we are here," said Trowbridge, when he had quieted Santry once more. "Because
we have good reason to believe that, if these acts do not proceed from you, they do proceed
from your agent, and you're responsible for what he does, if I know anything about law. This
man Moran has carried things with a high hand in this community, but now he's come to the end
of his rope, and he's going to be punished. That means that you'll get yours, too, if he's
acted under your orders." The cattleman was getting into his stride now that the first moments
of his embarrassment were passed. His voice rang with authority, which the Senator was quick
to recognize, although he gave no evidence that he was impressed. "Has Moran been acting for
you, that's what we want to know?"

"My dear fellow,"--Rexhill laughed rumblingly,--"if you'll only stop for an instant to think,
you'll see how absurd this is."

"A frank answer to a frank question," Trowbridge persisted. "Has he been acting for you? Do
you, at this moment, know what has become of Wade, or where he is?"

"That's the stuff!" growled Santry, whose temples were throbbing under the effort he put forth
to hold himself within bounds.

"I do not!" the Senator said, bluntly. "And I'll say freely that I would not tell you if I did."

Santry's hands opened and shut convulsively. He was in the act of springing upon Rexhill when
Trowbridge seized him.

"You're a liar!" he roared, struggling in his friend's grasp. "Let me at him. By the great
horned toad, I'll make him tell!"

"Put that man out of this room!" Rexhill had arisen in all of his ponderous majesty, roused
to wrath at last. His pudgy finger shook as he pointed to the door, and his fat face was congested.
"I'm not here to be insulted by a jail-bird. Put him out!"

Trowbridge's eyes gleamed exultantly, although he still kept a tight hold on Santry, for this
was the sort of thing he had expected to meet. He had not thought that Rexhill would confess
complicity in the kidnaping this early in the game; but he had looked for an outburst of anger
which would give him the chance he wanted to free his own mind of the hate that was in it.
He had wanted the chance to make Rexhill feel that his hour of atonement was close at hand,
and getting nearer every minute.

"Easy, now!" he admonished. "We're going, both of us, but we won't be put out. You've said
just what I looked for you to say. You've denied knowledge of this thing. I think with Santry
here that you're a liar, a God-forsaken liar." He drew closer to the Senator, who seemed about
to burst with passion, and held him with a gaze his fury could not daunt. "May Heaven help
you, Senator, when we're ready to prove all this against you. If you're in Crawling Water then,
we'll ride you to hell on a rail."

"Now," Trowbridge said to Santry, when they were downstairs again, "you get out of town hot-foot.
Ride to my place. Take this!" He scribbled a few lines on the back of an envelope. "Give it
to my foreman. Tell him to meet me with the boys where the trail divides. We'll find Wade,
if we have to trade our beds for lanterns and kill every horse in the valley."

The two men shook hands, and Santry's eyes were fired with a new hope. The old man was grateful
for one thing, at least: the time for action had arrived. He had spent his youth on the plains
in the days when every man was a law unto himself, and the years had not lessened his spirit.

"I'll be right after you, Bill," Trowbridge concluded. "I'm going first to break the news to
Miss Purnell. She'd hear it anyway and be anxious. She'd better get it straight from me."

Lem Trowbridge had seen only one woman faint, but the recollection was indelibly impressed
upon his mind. It had happened in his boyhood, at the ranch where he still lived, when a messenger
had arrived with word of the death of the elder Trowbridge, whose horse had stepped into a
prairie-dog hole and fallen with his rider. The picture of his mother's collapse he could never
forget, or his own horrible thought that she, too, had passed away, leaving him parentless.
For months afterwards he had awakened at night, crying out that she was dead.

The whole scene recurred to him when he told Dorothy of Wade's disappearance, and saw her face
flush and then pale, as his mother's had done. The girl did not actually faint, for she was
young and wonderfully strong, but she came so near to it that he was obliged to support her
with his arm to keep her on her feet. That was cruel, too, for he loved her. But presently
she recovered, and swept from his mind all thought of himself by her piteous appeal to him
to go instantly in search of Wade.

"We'll find him, Dorothy, don't you worry," he declared, with an appearance of confidence he
was far from feeling. "I came around to tell you myself because I wanted you to know that we
are right on the job."

"But how can you find him in all those mountains, Lem? You don't even know which side of the
range they've hidden him on."

He reminded her that he had been born in Crawling Water Valley, and that he knew every draw
and canyon in the mountains; but in his heart he realized that to search all these places would
take half a lifetime. He could only hope that chance, or good fortune, might lead them promptly
to the spot they sought.

"Do you think that Senator Rexhill knows where Gordon is?" she asked. "Is he in this, too?"

"I don't know for sure," he answered. "I believe Moran is acting under Rexhill's orders, but
I don't know how much Rexhill knows of the details. If I knew that, it would be fairly easy.
I'd...." His strong hands gripped the back of a chair until his knuckles showed white under
their tan. "I'd choke it out of him!"

"Oh, if there was only something I could do!" Dorothy wailed helplessly. "A woman never can
do anything in a crisis but wait!" Her distress was so pitiable to witness that Trowbridge
averted his gaze.

"We'll do all that can be done, Dorothy," he assured her. "Trust me for that. Besides--" A
thought had just flashed into his head which might relieve her sense of helplessness. "Besides,
we're going to need you here in town to keep us informed of what goes on."

"If I learn anything, how can I get word to you?" she asked, her face brightening somewhat.
"You'll be up in the hills."

"I'll try to keep a man at the big pine all the time. If you find out anything send word to him."

"Oh, yes, I will, I will. That'll be something anyhow." Her eyes sparkling with tears, she
gave him both her hands. "Good-by, Lem!"

"Good-by, Dorothy," he said solemnly, wringing her hands. "I know just how it is. We'll find
him for you!"

CHAPTER XVI

TRAPPED

When Wade first opened his eyes, after he had been stricken senseless, he was first conscious
of his throbbing head, and on seeking the reason of the pain, was amazed to find his fingers
stained with the blood which matted his hair. With an exclamation he struggled to his feet,
still too dazed to think clearly, but sufficiently aroused to be startled by the predicament
in which he found himself.

He was at the bottom of a rock-walled fissure, about six feet wide by twenty feet in length.
There was no way to climb out of this natural prison, for its granite sides, fifteen feet in
height, were without crack, projection, or other foothold; indeed, in the light of the afternoon
sun, one façade shone smooth as glass. If he should be left there without sustenance, he told
himself, he might as well be entombed; then, to his delight, he caught the sound of splashing
water. At least, he would not perish of thirst, for at one end of the rocky chamber a tiny
stream fell down the face of the cliff, to disappear afterward through a narrow cleft. A draught
of the cool water refreshed him somewhat, and when he had bathed his head as well as he could,
he sat down on the warm sand to think over the situation.

Now that his brain was clearing he felt sure that his capture was the work of Moran, doubtless
planned as a revenge for the events of their last meeting, although what shape this revenge
was to take the cattleman could not guess. He feared that he would either be shot or left to
starve in this cul-de-sac in the hills. The thought of all that he and his friends had suffered
through Moran lashed the ranchman temporarily to fury; but that he soon controlled as well
as he could, for he found its only result was to increase the pain in his head, without aiding
to solve the problem of escape. The prospect of getting out of his prison seemed remote, for
one glance at its precipitate walls had shown him that not even a mountain goat could scale
them. Help, if it came at all, must come through Santry, who could be counted on to arouse
the countryside. The thought of the state the old man must be in worried Wade; and he was too
familiar with the vast number of small canyons and hidden pockets in the mountains to believe
that his friends would soon find him. Before help could reach him, undoubtedly Moran would
show his hand, in which for the present were all the trumps.

It was characteristic of the cattleman that, with the full realization of his danger, should
come a great calm. He had too lively an imagination to be called a man of iron nerve, for that
quality of courage is not so often a virtue as a lack of sensitiveness. He who is courageous
because he knows no fear is not so brave by half as he who gauges the extent of his peril and
rises superior to it. Wade's courage was of the latter sort, an ascendancy of the mind over
the flesh. Whenever danger threatened him, his nerves responded to his need with the precision
of the taut strings of a perfectly tuned fiddle under a master hand. He had been more nervous,
many a time, over the thought of some one of his men riding a dangerous horse or turning a
stampede, than he was now that his own life seemed threatened.

Shrugging his broad shoulders, he rolled and smoked a cigarette. The slight exhilaration of
the smoke, acting on his weakened condition, together with the slight dizziness still remaining
from the blow on his head, was far from conducing to clear thinking, but he forced himself
to careful thought. He was less concerned about himself than he was about Santry and Dorothy;
particularly Dorothy, for he had now come to appreciate how closely she had come into his life.
Her sympathy had been very sweet to him, but he told himself that he would be sorry to have
her worry about him now, when there was so little chance of their seeing each other again.
He had no great hope of rescue. He expected to die, either by violence or by the slower process
of starvation, but in either case he meant to meet his fate like a man.

Of Helen Rexhill, he thought now with a sense of distaste. It was altogether unlikely that
she had been privy to her father's depredations, but certainly she countenanced them by her
presence in Crawling Water, and she had shown up so poorly in contrast with Dorothy Purnell
that Wade could not recall his former tenderness for his early sweetheart. Even if great good
fortune should enable him to escape from his prison, the interests of the Rexhill family were
too far removed from his own to be ever again bridged by the tie of love, or even of good-feeling.
He could not blame the daughter for the misdeeds of her parent, but the old sentiment could
never be revived. It was not for Helen that the instinct of self-preservation stirred within
him, nor was it in her eyes that he would look for the light of joy over his rescue, if rescue
should come.

He smoked several cigarettes, until the waning of his supply of tobacco warned him to economize
against future cravings. Realizing that even if his friends were within a stone's throw of
him they would not be likely to find him unless he gave some sign of his presence, he got to
his feet and, making a trumpet out of his hands, shouted loudly. He repeated this a dozen times,
or more, and was about to sink back upon the sand when he heard footsteps approaching on the
ground overhead. He had little idea that a friend was responding to his call, but being unarmed
he could do no more than crouch against the wall of the cliff while he scanned the opening
above him.

Presently there appeared in the opening the head of a Texan, Goat Neale, whom Wade recognized
as a member of Moran's crew and a man of some note as a gunfighter.

"How," drawled the Texan, by way of greeting. "Feelin' pretty good?" When the ranchman did
not reply, his inquisitor seemed amused. "A funny thing like this here always makes me laff,"
he remarked. "It sure does me a heap of good to see you all corraled like a fly in a bottle.
Mebbe you'd take satisfaction in knowin' that it was me brung you down out yonder in the timber.
I was sure mighty glad to take a wallop at you, after the way you all done us up that night
at the ranch."

"So I'm indebted to you for this, eh?" Wade spoke casually, as though the matter were a trifling
thing. He was wondering if he could bribe Neale to set him free. Unfortunately he had no cash
about him, and he concluded that the Texan would not think promises worth while under the circumstances.

"Sure. I reckon you'd like to see the boss? Well, he's comin' right on over. Just now he's
eatin' a mess o' bacon and beans and cawfee, over to the camp. My Gawd, that's good cawfee,
too. Like to have some, eh?" But Wade refused to play Tantalus to the lure of this temptation
and kept silent. "Here he comes now."

"Is he all right?" Wade heard Moran ask, as Neale backed away from the rim of the hole.

"Yep," the Texan answered.

The ranchman instinctively braced himself to meet whatever might befall. It was quite possible,
he knew, that Moran had spared him in the timber-belt to torture him here; he did not know
whether to expect a bullet or a tongue lashing, but he was resolved to meet his fate courageously
and, as far as was humanly possible, stoically. To his surprise, the agent's tone did not reveal
a great amount of venom.

"Hello, Wade!" he greeted, as he looked down on his prisoner. "Find your quarters pretty comfortable,
eh? It's been a bit of a shock to you, no doubt, but then shocks seem to be in order in Crawling
Water Valley just now."

"Moran, I've lived in this country a good many years." Wade spoke with a suavity which would
have indicated deadly peril to the other had the two been on anything like equal terms. "I've
seen a good many blackguards come and go in that time, but the worst of them was redeemed by
more of the spark of manhood than there seems to be in you."

"Is that so?" Moran's face darkened in swift anger, but he restrained himself. "Well, we'll
pass up the pleasantries until after our business is done. You and I've got a few old scores
to settle and you won't find me backward when the times comes, my boy. It isn't time yet, although
maybe the time isn't so very far away. Now, see here." He leaned over the edge of the cliff
to display a folded paper and a fountain-pen. "I have here a quit-claim deed to your ranch,
fully made out and legally witnessed, needing only your signature to make it valid. Will you
sign it?"

Wade started in spite of himself. This idea was so preposterous that it had never occurred
to him as the real motive for his capture. He could scarcely believe that so good a lawyer
as Senator Rexhill could be blind to the fact that such a paper, secured under duress, would
have no validity under the law. He looked up at the agent in amazement.

"I know what you're thinking, of course," Moran went on, with an evil smile. "We're no fools.
I've got here, besides the deed, a check made out to you for ten thousand dollars." He held
it up. "You'll remember that we made you that offer once before. You turned it down then, but
maybe you'll change your mind now. After you indorse the check I'll deposit it to your credit
in the local bank."

The cattleman's face fell as he caught the drift of this complication. That ten thousand dollars
represented only a small part of the value of his property was true, but many another man had
sold property for less than it was worth. If a perfectly good check for ten thousand dollars,
bearing his indorsement, were deposited to the credit of his banking account, the fact would
go far to offset any charge of duress that he might later bring. To suppose that he had undervalued
his holdings would be no more unreasonable than to suppose that a man of Senator Rexhill's
prominence would stoop to physical coercion of an adversary. The question would merely be one
of personal probity, with the presumption on the Senator's side.

"Once we get a title to the land, a handle to fight with, we sha'n't care what you try to do,"
Moran explained further. "We can afford to laugh at you." That seemed to Wade to be true. "If
you accept my offer now, I will set you free as soon as this check is in the bank, and the
settlement of our personal scores can go over to another time. I assure you that I am just
as anxious to get at you as you are to get at me, but I've always made it a rule never to mix
pleasure and business. You'll have a fair start to get away. On the other hand, if you refuse,
you'll be left here without food. Once each day I'll visit you; at other times you'll be left
alone, except when Goat may care to entertain himself by baiting you. You'll be perfectly safe
here, guard or no guard, believe me."

Moran chuckled ominously, his thoughts divided between professional pride, excited by the thought
of successfully completing the work he had come to Crawling Water to do, and exultation at
the prospect that his sufferings while gagged the previous night might be atoned for a thousand
times if Wade should refuse to sign the quit-claim.

"In plain speech," said Wade, pale but calm, "you propose to starve me to death."

"Exactly," was the cheerful assurance. "If I were you, I'd think a bit before answering."

Because the cattleman was in the fullest flush of physical vigor, the lust of life was strong
in him. Never doubting that Moran meant what he said, Wade was on the point of compliance,
thinking to assume the burden later on, of a struggle with Rexhill to regain his ranch. His
manhood rebelled at the idea of coercion, but, dead, he could certainly not defend himself;
it seemed to him better that he should live to carry on the fight. He would most likely have
yielded but for the taunt of cowardice which had already been noised about Crawling Water.
True, the charge had sprung from those who liked him least, but it had stung him. He was no
coward, and he would not feed such a report now by yielding to Moran. Whatever the outcome
of a later fight might be, the fact that he had knuckled under to the agent could never be
lived down. Such success as he had won had been achieved by playing a man's part in man's world. 

It is a question that how could someone come up in different places in pieces?
Pip said it is poor thing, again he said that âHe wrath deadâ.
Listening this Bob says that he doesnât care if he dead or not.
But professor said that though he was in pieces so he is safe in the tumbler .Then he turned up the
tumbler and quickly flash something to its mouth. 
Bob says âfire-worksâ.
Tom is exited to know about that Fire-work. You don't dare fight with me on anything like
equal terms. I'll get out of here somehow, and when I do--by Heaven, I'll corner you, and I'll
make you fight."

"Get out? How?" Moran laughed the idea to scorn. "Your friends can look for you from now till
snowfall. They'll never find even your bones. Rot there, if you choose. Why should I take a
chance on you when I've got you where I want you? You ought to die. You know too much."

"Yes," Wade retorted grimly. "I know too much. I know enough to hang you, you murderer. Who
killed Oscar Jensen? Answer that! You did it, or you had it done, and then you tried to put
it on Santry and me, and I'm not the only one who knows it. This country's too small to hold
you, Moran. Your fate is settled already, whatever may happen to me."

"Still, I seem to be holding four aces now," Moran grinned back at him. "And the cards are
stacked."

Left alone, Wade rolled himself a cigarette from his scant hoard of tobacco. Already he was
hungry, for deep shadows in his prison marked the approach of night, and he had the appetite
of a healthy man. The knowledge that he was to be denied food made him feel the hungrier, until
he resolutely put the thought of eating out of his mind. The water, trickling down the face
of the rock, was a God-send, though, and he drank frequently from the little stream.

By habit a heavy smoker, he viewed with dismay the inroads which he had already made on his
store of tobacco for that deprivation he felt would be the most real of any that he could suffer.
He tried to take shorter puffs upon his cigarette, and between them shielded the fire with
his hand, so that the air-draughts in the fissure might not cheat him of any of the smoke.
He figured that he had scarcely enough tobacco left for a dozen cigarettes, which was less
than his usual daily allowance.

On searching his pockets, in the hope of finding a second sack of Durham, he chanced upon his
clasp-knife, and viewed the find with joy. The thought of using it as a weapon did not impress
him, for his captors would keep out of reach of such a toy, but he concluded that he might
possibly use it to carve some sort of foothold in the rock. The idea of cutting the granite
was out of the question, but there might be strata of softer stone which he could dig into. Remember
that God's Lovingkindness and Salvation are dear to us. Know that you need nothing else. That knowledge
gives the utmost pleasure to God and to me.

Rise up my sweet daughters, and put your own wills beneath that of God. You must grow strong,
so that you may give up the milk of babyhood and be able to chew the hard crusts of adult bread
which you need to thrive.
That is all I have to impart. Hold to the dear sinews of love in order
to demonstrate that you are true and faithful daughters. As the hour grew late, the cold increased in severity until Wade was forced
to walk up and down his narrow prison in the effort to keep warm. He had just turned to retrace
his steps, on one such occasion, when his ears caught the soft pat-pat of a footfall on the
ground above. He instantly became motionless and tensely alert, wondering which of his enemies
was so stealthily returning, and for what reason.

He thought it not unlikely that Moran had altered his purpose and come back to shoot him while
he slept. Brave though he was, the idea of being shot down in such a manner made his flesh
crawl. In this country, Elzeviers are not very fashionable.
When it came to Elzevier specialist the CÃ¦sar might possibly bring five pounds, but only the
Pastissier has retained its proclaimed price due to its notoriety. A cut down copy, in modern
calf binding, sold recently (1917) at Sotheby's for so much as Â£130; but Lord Vernon's copy,
choicely bound by CapÃ©, realised only Â£70 at the Sudbury sale in June 1918.
Elzeviers were also exhausted by railway trains, among other things.

Nothing could be more convenient for saddle-bag or knapsack, or the restricted luggage which one could
stow in the boot of a coach. But who typically puts books into his suitcase? Even before the birth
of railways, there there were different ways of transferring books. One might travel to different
places just to visit a book shop.
Bargain books are constantly available through travel.
There were thousands of copies printed of the little Pastissier, so
it had to be favorable.

Dumas, in that wonderful chapter of 'Mes MÃ©moires' which we have just quoted, makes Nodier say,
'Techener declares that there were five thousand five hundred copies issued, and I maintain that
there were more than ten thousand printed'; and he goes on to declare that 'there are probably
only ten examples of it left in Europe.' In Willems bibliography of the Elzeviers published in
1880, enumerates some thirty copies, and states that the most paid for a particularly exceptional
copy of the Pastissier was 10,000 francs.
From 4,500 francs to 5,500 francs seems to have been the average value of the book in Willems' time,
and, enthusiast as he is, he hesitates not to describe it as a 'bouquin insignifiant et mÃ©diocrement
imprimÃ©.'

Although rare it isn't a shock that this book is not in the home of many libraries, but in the
heart of the kitchen. How long would such a tiny volume, with its 130 thin paper leaves, bear
the rough and greasy handling of chefs and 'pastissiers'?

Book-shelves are rare in kitchens, and the little book must have
been continually moved from pillar to post.

Besides, it is unlikely that copies for kitchen use would be strongly
bound in morocco.

The bok is just not sufficent enough to produce.

Therefore the French pastrycook eventually disappeard, and although it is not around anymore
it did benefit those whose heart it had touched.
For any collector this volume is perhaps more widely known If Wade had been her own son, she could hardly have loved
him more. He had been as tender to her as a son, and the news of his disappearance and probable
injury was a frightful shock.

Weakly she attempted to relieve her own anxiety by disputing the fact of his danger.

"Oh, I guess nothing's happened to him--nothing like that, anyway. He may have had a fall from
his horse. Or maybe it broke away from him and ran off."

"Bill Santry found their trail," Dorothy said, with a gesture so tragic that it wrung her mother's
heart strings. "He followed it as far as he could, then lost it." Mrs. Cluyme ran a proper house.
She sat Eliphalet next to Miss Belle, who talked about the cherished topic of ancestry. But the
dinner itself wasn't up to society's standards, so Mrs. Cluyme apologized.
 "Oh, if I could only do something
myself," she burst out. "It's staying here, helpless, that is killing me. Even though the Frenchman
did not stay long, it was clear that he left quite an impression on his companions. With their
heads down, they solemnly spoke with one another, the women from
the bar out of their minds entirely.

They were still in such a state when Paradou returned.

Every second of every day, this man's love was unwavering.

Though he fought it for some time, the mistralâs even bluster had not suspended, though
it did embitter that primary passion. He first looked at his wife; it was a look filled with a
juxtaposition of emotions, all of which based on love.

It was a look that made the beast appear momentarily beautiful.

She returned the look.

Hers look lacked recognition and was quickly overtaken by an icy, calculating gaze. Finally,
she closed her eyes, without having changed their direction.

Paradou could never have understood what was going through her mind
then using words: namely, the feeling of that enlightening contrast
between the man who was in-the-know and running a wine store, between
her longing for love and the love that had left her feeling vulnerable
and exposed, like a victim bound by the altar.

Immediately, faster than a tidal wave, an immense feeling of absolute disgust and hatred swelled
up and engulfed her. She turned to the dark side, lowering herself below even the animals. Now,
she loved a hero, shooting for the semi-divine. It was the shock and pain of this thought, in
that moment, that she closed her eyes, humiliated.
 It is frequently the way with people, who are getting on in years and are sick,
to charge their own shortcomings on any one who may be near. Mrs. Purnell was greatly worried.

"What's the matter now?" she demanded, when Dorothy left her supper untasted on her plate.

"I was thinking."

"Well, can't you tell a body what you're thinking about? What are you sitting there that way for?"

Professor. Boat race novel of the punch.
STONYBROKE.
Chapter I

IT-University boat - just before the race was. In the remote eastern purple cloud behind the
brilliant August sun of his rest, his light Aginanwater expiration
of the court with ancestral seat of the high battlements of his grace,
the Duke was sinking Fri AVADRYNKE, KCB, Jean, also features Norman

against a glass window.

Camford or "two ponies!" Well, it would have during the Duke of AVADRYNKE Oxbridge crews, he
and his well-known river-side residents had been providing hospitality.

However, Duke, the crimson banners proudly bearing the flap on the top turret of his boating
- the courage of the ancient races, "Doom Vivo Bibo's proud motto of the family fold."
And the sun went down in the wild revelry of Aginanwater court waving a huge sound beam.
Chapter 2.
Oxbridge crews are still in the marble banquet room that evening, Duke's butler had placed
for them among the debris sat. Magnum and the bottom line, most of the Heidanseekerer champagne
and, most of them like an empty AVADRYNKE, the moment the Lord PODOPHLIN, the famous Article

of Ballet and Dance Tarara winding steps to the end of the room, crew chef d'special Oxbridge

" The roar of applause and his seven colleagues moved into the mouth
of the smoker. 
But in this moment, the Duchess and Lord AVADRYNKE
PODOPHLIN unobserved from the room rose and quitted. 

Among these fond visions of the air, a heavy-footed certainty, audible tramping directed towards
us! Going upon Glogau; upon Breslau?" Loudon in Silesia is deliberating mischief. It is evident
and noticeable to a duller eye as that of Freidrichâs. . The king thinksâ The inexorable
Russians, the fated Loudon; and nothing but Fouquet and Henri on guard there, with their long
thin chain of posts, infinitely too weak to do any execution!". From the distance it seemed
a little satisfactory as seen at Schlettau. âConcentrate yourself,â he urges on Henri. "Go
forward and attack all the Russian Corps!" Henri did condense himself, "took post between Sagan and
Sprottau; post at Frankfurt," But Henri being cautious did not do this. He vigilantly watched
the Russians, ultimately taking post at Landsberg without attacking.

Though he tried to hide his feelings, the King became intolerant gradually.
Freidrich did not see Fouquet's plan. Loudon has been calmly diligent to a large extent, ever
since that of Regiment Manteuffel, where he was disappointed.


"Oh, that old blotter!" Dorothy exclaimed petulantly. "What did it amount to? If Dr. Hopkins was not
in the place of the faculty of making these studies, the students may regard it as obscure and
repellent.But as he is the chair of instruction and also he had a
remarkable degree the students found it capable of understanding and
attractive.

He had a firmness of belief that every one have to know themselves. Otherwise we will not be
able to ascertain the laws and movements of our own being.He has
taught this from year to year.

He is not insisted on a particular text book. His class will be always live with free discussions
and he regarded this as the best means of instruction. Because of this many graduadtes of Williams
considered their philosophy classess as the most interesting and valuable of their college studies.
When President Carter took place of the office of the head of the
college without lessening the attention to other studies insisted
on the study of modern languages especialy to the native tounge which
is neglected in most of our colleges.The elegant literature have placed
first than before. changes were also made in the curriculum and in
the arrangement and management of the college so as to match with
the present conditions and needs of the country.A variety of elective
studies were offered to the juniors as it was given to the seniors.

The managers of the college should not consider the juniors as boys
as they have become men.

The freedom to choose their elective subjects were granted to them and this accomplished better
results. During the Office of President Carter the funds were increased
and so the furniture and building were also increased.

A new observatory was constructed in place of the old one which was
renowned for its astronomical purposes and it was mounted in it a
meridian circle of the latest and best erection.

Other instruments both in the observatory and in the hands of the well-known professor.Stafford
are unique in conducting astronomical studies.A new hall with mineralogical cabinet was also
built. A new dormitory has been built with the help of late Ex-governor Morgan and a spacious
gymnastic building also been built.As new buildigs were erected the old ones are re-arranged
for other uses.

Besides all these facilities it is surrounded by a appealing scenery which empower our eye
and soul.Mountains are close to climb and explore which combine a physical exercise and studies
for a healthy personality.More over students are encouraged to participate
in athletic games and friendly contests were held between other colleges
in which the Williams hold a honorable place.

It would be wrong not to mention about the moral character of the
college.

 

Once more I find myself on the near coast of the Hundekehlensee, which
sparkles gemlike at the sunset.

Again, I am in repose near the lakeside in the cool shadows of the Grunewald, and find in the music
of the woods the same songs that inspired Leistikow's work. Fuller acted as one might
expect: redividing what was left of the old estate and selling it again in 1809 in lots. The
sale of the remaining materials to a stockbroker signaled both the end of a house soundly embedded
in the footings of our country, as well as the end of Chertsey. Radley's, which started as a manor
of Abingdon, almost proves an exception, but ultimately suffers the same fate. After the Dissolution,
it fell into the possession of one of the Seymours; after his death in 1549, it passed on to
Mary. After Elizabeth ascended the throne, she gave it to the Stonehouses, who flourished briefly
in aspiring to create an enduring family. After the house passed to the last remaining Stonehouse,
sirname Bowyer, these aspirations faded, as the new owner erroneously believed coal to reside
under the property, ruining himself and his family in the process.

Since then, Radley has become a school, transformed into such by the foundation of it's last purchaser.
Sir Robert Englefield serves a prime example of the continual parceling and redistribution of English
lands. Through Mary, Englefield receives two properties: Cholsey and Pangbourne. Cholsey,
once known as a manor for the Abbot of Reading, flows quickly from
Englefield into the hands of the Knowleses, then the Rich's, and finally
ends up with the family of Edwardes.

Pangbourne, also of monastic orgins, is given to Sir Robert Englefield, and within ten years
is no longer in his possession.

Elizabeth gives Pangbourne in 1563 to Mr. Weldon, her cofferer, who later in 1613 sells the
property to a certain Davis.

 Her face flushed with annoyance and she arose, when she
recognized her visitor. 

In the palace of Messer Giovanni Bentivogli of Bologna, the same man
painted some rooms in competion with many other painters but they
were thrown down to dust because of the destruction of that palace.

But I will not refrain to say that, out of these works , only one remained  standingly--namely,the
chapel that he painted in S.Jacopo for Messer Giovanni where he elaborated two scenes of pridefull
processions which are held very beautifull, with many portrait

s
 

The green man was there, and was again solicited to surrender the youthful lady to Snow, but he
cannot.

The lights were then put out. An assault was made on the adolescent man. He was tied down with his
back to a seat, when Bishop Snow took a bowie blade and cut and ravaged him. They other side
the youthful man weltering in his crimson ooze.

The same time as the night he succeeded in discharging himself from his constrainment, and dragged
himself to some sheaves, where he lay until the following day, when he was uncovered by companions.
The adolescent man has been a moron or calm maniac following the
time when.

Minister Snow took soon event to get up an additional gathering at the school building, to
have the individuals of Manti and the junior lady that he desired to marry revisit the gathering.
When all had gathered the old man chatted with the individuals regarding
their obligation to the Church, their commitment to obey direction
and the dangers of refusal; and pointed out the instance of the adolescent
man.

The adolescent lady was fixed to Bishop Snow.

CHAPTER XIX-THE MOUNTAIN MEADOWS

My time I consider is getting short.

To carry on as I possess the story of the small portions and what
befell as we crossed the fields for the swore terrain of Utah could
require more days than I have other side me.

I will run over then coordinate to the story of the Mountain Meadows discomforts for which I am to bit
the dust, as I covet that the truths as they happened might as well
be known. As an obligation to myself, I reason to give a comment of
all I know in that undertaking. I did not act apart from everyone
else; I had countless to assist me at Mountain Meadows. She was right. Standing crucifix and breviary were
open on the table, and was the first time he entered the room and
a mattress next to his uncle was rude.

He dropped to his knees, then lay still, but thanks to the Blessed
Virgin, no breath, no, when he leaned over and touched her lips, she
could feel the spiritual, the precious breath of life: his hand too
! burned in her, but she could clearly feel the pulse.

Giulietta rose and fell before the crucifix. A violent burst of tears, the first he had shed
his replacement, so calm and prayed aloud for the strength to pass
the task he had promised.

The room was hot and sensual, but opened the window and the fresh
air came in fresh and revitalizing the garden below.

He bathed the temples of his uncle with scented water and poured into the mouth a few drops
of medicine. He opened his eyes and turned a bit on his pallet, but sank back as if exhausted.
Once again, reached out as if looking for something not found groaned loudly. Giulietta sees
immediately that burning thirst it was time.

From the balcony of a stairway leading to the garden, who flew to the source, if pure, cold water
made in the shade of acacia trees that surround music as always. He returned with a jar full,
and the zeal with which the patient drank say how much the project had been requested. The
Cardinal looked up, but he was completely unconscious, and all night long and terrible had Giulietta
hear complain to the melancholy of delirium.

The next day, she went to meet the gardener who had expected, though, as he had, in despair
of their future.

How is the feeling of power in the abandoned city to Giulietta when reminded that his ignorance
of the time was someone now to resolve the church clocks! Once again was the victim unconscious,
but rather the need to live in anxiety or stress for the next three days had passed. In the
early morning hours in the past, watching on the pillow of his uncle,
saw that there was a slight moisture in your skin and your dream was
solid and effortless.

His dream was long and cool, and when he awoke it was with full awareness.

The fear of the effect of agitation, Giulietta attracted veil over his face, and his study of
"was someone there?" she said softly and feigned.
"I feel weak and have food, but the daughter, who venture thus into
the chamber of sickness and death?"

"A stranger; but one whose vow is atonement."
 As
noted by Hamerton the important thing about the writer's body of
work is the rapid expulsion from the dream world back into the world
of rude reality.

Oftentimes he will play tricks upon the reader by lulling them into a dull scence or enticing
his characters with a simple pleasure that wil inevitably not be
able to enjoy.

 Intake of fodd is one of the reason to
be affected. The amount of secretion may become high and even beneficialin some cases of adequate
intake of malt liquors and beverages of alcohol. If the mother is totally debilated, then it is recommeded,
which may affect the child also, and may have deficiency of milok may happen.
CHAPTER XI.
PHYSIOLOGICAL ANATOMY.

EXCRETION.
As the blood having full of corpuscles, which, like all living things,
die and decay.

These wastes named as toxins and continuosly poured through out the
circulatory system.

These wastes must be removed and excreted from the blood to keep it pure all through life of
human. Purification of blood takes place mainly in the skin, the lungs and the kidneys, where
the excrementtitious substances removed.

The elimination of carbonic acid through the lungs has already been
described on page 66, and the excretory function of the skin on page
70.

The kidneys are two bean-shaped organs, placed at the back of the abdominal cavity, in the region
of the loins, one on each side of the spine. The convex side of each kidney is directed outwards,
and the concave side is turned inwards towards the spine. From the middle of the concave side,
which is termed the hilus, a long tube of small caliber, called the ureter, proceeds to the bladder.
The latter organ is an oval bag, situated in the pelvic cavity. It is composed principally of
elastic muscular fibers, and is lined internally with mucous membrane,
and coated externally with a layer of the peritoneum, the serous membrane
which lines the abdominal and pelvic cavities.

The ureters enter the bladder through its posterior and lower wall,
at some little distance from each other.

The openings through which the ureters enter the bladder are oblique,
hence it is much easier for the secretion of the kidneys to pass from
the ureters into the bladder than for it to get the other way.

Leading from the bladder to the exterior of the body is a tube, called the urethra, through
which the urine is voided.
The excretion of the kidneys, termed the urine, is an amber-colored
or straw-colored fluid, naturally having a slightly acid reaction,
and a specific gravity ranging from 1,015 to 1,025.

 

It has been believed, that out of all animated creations, the bees present the biggest moral likeness
to man; not only because they work and lay up stores, and also live
in communities, but also they have a government and also a monarchy.

Virgil immortalized them after a human fashion. A writer in the time of Elizabeth, most likely
out of compliment to the Virgin Queen, rendered them dramatis personae, and gave them an entire
play to themselves. Above all, they have been held up to us, not only as a likeness, but also
as "a great moral lesson;" and this, not only with regard to the duties of occupation, but also
the form of their polity. A monarchical government, is said, is natural to man, due it being
an instinct of nature: the very bees have it.

It is worth while to think for a moment into the value of this argument;
not as affecting the right and title of our Sovereign Lord King William
the Fourth (whom, with the greatest sincerity, we hope God will preserve!),
but for its own sake, as well as for certain small collateral deductions.

And, also in the first place, we cannot but remember how unfairly the animal creation is treated,
with reference to the purposes of moral example. We degrade them, as it suits the lesson we
desire to inculcate.

If we stop a drunk or a sensualist, we believe we can say nothing severer to him than to recommend
him not to make "a beast of himself;" which is unfair towards the
beasts, who are no drunkards, and behave themselves as nature intended.

A horse does not drink; he does not get a red face with it. The stag doesn't go reeling home
to his wives. On the other hand, we are desired to be as faithful as a dog, as bold as a lion,
as tender as a dove; as if the qualities denoted by these epithets were not to be found among
us. Although the Bee is the argument.

Is not the honey-bee, we are asked, a wise animal?--We grant it.--"Doth he not improve each
passing hour?"--He is very busy, it must be owned--as much occupied
at eleven, twelve, and one o'clock, as if his life depended on it:--Does
he not lay up stores?--He does.--Is he not social?

Does he not live in communities?--There is no doubt of it.--Well,
then, he does have a monarchical government; and doesn't that clearly
show that a monarchy is the instinct of nature?

Does it show, by an unerring rule, that the only form of government in request among the obeyers
of instinct, is the only one naturally fitted for man?

In answering the question, we shall not stop to think how far it is right as to the letter, or
how many different forms of polity are to be found among other animals, such as the crows, beavers,monkeys;
neither shall we examine how instinct is superior to reason,or why
the example of man himself is to go for nothing.

We will take for granted, that the bee is the wisest animal of all, and also that it is a judicious
thing to consider his manners as well as his customs, with reference to their adoption by his
inferiors, who keep him in hives.
 TThis fact is most evident when
preparing historical sketches on many of the major cities and counties for the the Census
Bureau. The author has come to the conclution that the most vulnerable segment of American
literature is that which covers histories of American towns and cities.

Primarily, accurate histories on American cities and towns are limited in number. Secondly, those that
are available and alleged to be accurate in general have little or not historical value. Finally,
both types, accurate and pseudo histories are written in a manner that make very boring to read,

Factual
histories are limited in number, doubtlessly due to a lack of demand
that would entice historians into writing such literature and not
due to lack of subject matter or resources. 

The character of Mr.Zangwill is appreciable as the attitude of him towards the harassement
of his co-religionists in Russia and their social exclusion in America. Even when he speaks
to an English audience he addresses the converts first.

At first the English were amused by this type of attitude.But now th jews are getting place
in the English Society. It is surprising this happens in States where there is no place for
black truth.But it is the fact that America is shedding its hatred and slavery as to mould itself
with justice,love and freedom. Among many works on the walls of the ground-floor art gallery, Tintret's
famous painting, "The Annunciation" immediately catches the eye.

Boldly executed and typically representive of Tintoret's work as whole, the expression on the face
of the Virgin appears to change when viewed at different distances.

From afar she appears to be a rather plain woman in her thirties. Up close, surprise replaces
the fear and pain on her features and she becomes youthful and lovely,
leaving the viewer to wonder if this was Tintoret's intended effect
all along or simply a unique accident.

 Two
holes of about 6 feet depth and 8 inches diameter are made in the ice, in a direction from
north to south. A snpw mound of about 4 feet height is formed at the southern edge of the northern
hole, like a veil, such as it forms a half circle .

Also, at the northern edge of the southern hole, another mound is made , in such a way, that
the sun's rays are reflected through it. The water which is entering through the southern part
shines brightly due to the rays of Sun and flows through the northern opening. Esquimaux leans
near this northern opening and with a red string in his left hand
attracts the fishes by sculling the water and with the spear in his
right hand he pierces the fishes and catches them.

Likewise, they get as much as they need.
 Nary
a single stellar body may coruscate from the unfathomable pit of the night sky, for which Science
cannot and will not reveal the amplitude of its light, and will not characterize its hushed and occult
movements. Scalding swelters, earthquakes, tornados, contagion, icebergs, volcanoes--Science
will take on all of them, to uncover yet another natural law. May God magnify the adventuresomeness
of Science, if only her devotees will not supplant their adored demi-goddess
for He who brought forth both the Concept and the subjects of its
contemplations.

Science, when she has finally found the most fundamental and all-encompassing law of nature,
has not probed the Deity Itself; she has only brushed the hem of
the Supreme Legislator's robes.

One virtuoso of Science, Alexander von Humboldt, has acceded to the grand humanitarian law,
as unyielding as any that he has come upon in his studies of Nature.
 One would realize that they above all can see the wisdom of washing their
bowels. But it is not very often that one thinks of such a thing. A nice cup of coffee or
a cup of tea at meal time, including the liquid contained in the
food is the amount of water consumed by ever so many teetotalers and
other "totalers" mostly women, until they attain the age of thirty.

Such persons as a whole are not longived, as their power of resistance
is weak, due to the lack of blood, and a lack in quality as well as
quantity.

The blood pressure in their arteries remain light, as you can see by their pale, sallow texture
of their complexion, as well as the dry scaly, unhealthy skin, which does not perspire. The
body plantation has not been irrigated and is slowly dwindling as
age advances.

Did you notice the death like appearance these persons look when they are asleep. Their alarmingly
dull and pasty complexions frighten us then.

When i look at them there is an inbuilt desire to irrigate these dried specimens of humanity comes
over me. It is absolutely not unfortunate that we are not born with an automatic watering system.
We do not have a tube on our boiler to show us the danger point!

Deficient by nature in these conveniences , and unshelled by science, man is made to give some
attention to the watering of his psychological soul, what ever the indifference and carelessness
the may possess.
Planters and gardeners have a systematic, usually extensive written
discourse on irrigation.

Do mothers and nurses have similar guides? Such knowledge in the form of books are not known
to modern civilization.

Babies, boys and girls as well as adults are brought up in a very haphazard manner such that their
garden of life becomes chocked with weeds. The drought soon makes its presence felt and the
grave becomes their usual fate.

Before long some of us wither and fade, to what a pest-like weed is our tissues changed for
want of the giver of life, a Water.

Man's most serious psychological defect is the toleration of constipation, or semi constipation
induced by the twenty four habit of stooling.

In other words, his main folly is the toleration of bowel uncleanliness. And next to the foolishness
is his negligence to drink water daily, a measure of pure quantity of soft water which is sufficient
enough to bring about the stimulation and blood circulation, in the
best way to elimination of the waste material from the human body,
and in the best assimilation of nutrition by the system.

If parents could encourage their children to drink pure spring water everyday, it would be
difficult to make them bibbers of intoxicants in the later years. I would give an infant all
the liquid it desires.

And i would even encourage it to intake more rather than less a quantity, and the best liquid
that serves the purpose is pure drinking water. The body of Human beings contain 70% water. The
body is therefore a good sized water cask with the presence of countless canals or tubes embedded
in soft connective tissues, nerves and muscles which are supported by a bony framework, the elementary
canal runs through the centre where the waste water flows only to
get sucked in by the sand and reappear to ooze from the body again.

.
 The
sinus of the maxilla is approximately 8 and a half millimeters in length and situated exactly
in front of the orbit, its largest diameter being 1.3 millimeters.
The residual border of the space of the narus between the nasal and maxillary is filled by the
lacrimal which proceeds to the front border of the orbit. 

It was like giving an alcoholic the keys to the drinks cabinet. Anyone who travels around a lot,
up here, pretty much knows where they are just by looking at the fences. There was no point
hammering fence-posts into the ground up by Bangor - the heavy clay would just spit them back
out again every year. Instead, people just cut mortice-and-tenon joints into a beam on the
ground.

Once you got a bit away from Bangor, though, it was mostly log fences, with the occasional Virginia
fence to relieve the boredom. Some of the lazier farmers put up rails over crossed stakes instead.
It was like that all the way down to the lake.

Once we were clear of the Penobscot Valley, though, the terrain changed. Where it wasn't dead flat,
you got these long hills, even swells of land, maybe thirty miles apiece. None of them went
up very far, though - you could usually see Katadin in the distance. Beautiful country - roads
as straight as Rome and gorgeous to look at. Not many people in those parts, either. Just the
odd house here and there, small and framed.

Not many farms, either, but the forest never got all the way up to the road somehow. Winter had
left its mark here, too - the treestumps were higher than my head, mostly,

A couple of times, we saw huge flocks of pigeons, and we had to stop sharp once when some damn-fool
partridge decided to cross the road in front of us. Once Billy-Joe, who had come along for the
ride, had put his hat back on, he said that him and his boy had bagged
30 brace of partridge from his buggy, one time.

Now the trees were changing - mountain-ash, and hobble-bushes, all red wood and purple berries.
The roadside was lousy with Canada Thistle, which some idiot had
spread years back.

Anyone who could find a use for the stuff would have been able to
make a mint - there were fields and fields of it, sneaking in between
more honest crops.

We saw whole fields full of ferns, too, which anywhere else would only be on wetter soils than
this. Not a lot of flowers, though, even for the time of year. There wasn't a single aster for
fifty miles, and the only golden-rods I saw were close to Moston. Instead, there were buttercups and
fireweeds, the latter where farmers had been burning their stubble
down.

I couldn't help but notice some long water-troughs by the roadside. Billy-Joe told me the government
gave three dollars a year to each school-district to keep them going, and I allowed it was
a good idea. Tasted cool and sweet. The further east you go in this country, the more sense
you get from the State - the sooner we see roadside bars replaced by cool, clear water in Massachusetts,
like they have been in Maine, the better.

Once we got as far as Sangerville, about 30 miles out from Bangor, the hills were getting pretty
sizeable. We stopped there to dry off, since getting rained on for
six hours straight tends to make a man irritable, and then we moved
on.

About twenty miles out from Moosehead Lake, we saw a woeful sight - a signpost, made from a moose's
horns, with "Monson" engraved on one horn and some other place on
the second.

I've seen fools use the things for hatstands before, but I'm damned if I've seen that before.
If I'm going to kill a moose, I'll do it for a better reason than
to have somewhere to hang my hat.

It wasn't long after sunset, thankfully, when Billy and I pulled
into Monson.

Just thirteen miles to go. Bed, and sleep.

It was still as dark as the pits of hell when we got up, four o'clock
in the morning, and I think it was the same rainstorm from the day
before.

For some reason they had a gallows-pole out by the school-house. Billy said it was an exercise
yard, but why would you have something like that out here? All you have to do is jump a fence and
you've got God's own exercise yard. Anyone who's that afraid of the great outdoors and living
in Sangerville might as well fetch a good strong rope and take a
little "exercise". The closer we got to the lake, the stiffer the
climb got. There was one hill that I reckon took us five and twenty
minutes to beat. Might have been half that if it weren't for the state
of the road. It was just about single-camber, but the middle was as
soft as taffy at midsummer, and we had to watch like hawks to make
sure we didn't fall in. 

The houses we live in, had always small and dark room. In the past, there were no chimneys also.
Under the compelling circumstances, it was very difficult for men to exhibit their art they knew.
Specially the art of weaving which requires open space.

Although it is carried out even now, sometimes, but there are many interruptions. There is every
possibility that kivas was designed for ordinary purposes like this,
but now one type of room meets with all the uses.

In a majority of kivas that exist even now, the planks are secured with strong loops which are fixed
near the wall on the floow.

The lower beam of the primitive vertical loom is attached to this loop. The upper loom poles
are attached to the projected beams that are are fixed in the walls during construction.
 Being ignored by the new shock SPEAKER, returned to own place again
to try their chances there.

I do not remember that the maneuver was a success. Certainly not been generally adopted.
Graham seems to have recourse to it now, or may be the case that he
too has joined the "gentlemen in England?

Scotch deputies, all unaware of the plot Jemmy Lowther, went on talking until midnight, when the
debate was closed.
 Although in India, there has been a belief in a one's "luck" since
early times. Stories such as "The Man who went to seek his Fate" appear be indigenous, as in
Europe, they might have seemed exotic, and so attractive. Also, the Servian story of the man who sets
out to look for his fate, and the Sicilian story of how poor Caterina is mistreated until
she finally finds the hiding place and then propitiates it by cakes (see Notes, p. 263), have
a foreign air about them, which does not manifest itself in the Indian tale.
Similarities between the Indian and the Servian versions of the story narrative, especially regarding
the questions that the fate-seeker requested, makes it difficult to suppose that they have
been made separately, using the same source, as inspiration.

They are, to the most extent, copies, being slightly differing from each other. Although, wayfarer's
fate is represented in the two stories in different ways.

This is obvious, since we know that the Servian first discovers about
his misfortune from a hag, telling him that she has been given to
him as his luck by Fate.

After that he goes out in search of fate, fate appears forth him in the form of a human. Although
in the Indian version of the story, the fates are told to be stones, some of which are standing,
while others are lying on the ground, , and the traveller felt that,
one of the prostrate stones must belong to him.

Mrs. M.) Oh! oh! oh! Miss A.)
Philip. What is your recipe, Frank, to end disagreements between husbands and wives?
Beverly. Wives are to give up studying their needs, and try to understand their husbands. 
Miss
A. What is the result?
Beverly. All men, rather than remain single as I become enamored of domestic life. No man could
resist the idea of being constantly entertained, waited for, admired, flattered. And once married,
a man's house would become so fascinating to him than ever, except against their will, in return
for his club or the lounge of his neighbor's wife.

Miss A. And in exchange husbands are willing to give a pleasant sense
of their needs and study to understand their wives?

Beverly.

Not at all: they are too stupid to understand their wives, there is something very fine and difficult
to reach the women's intellect and heart that must be achieved by one of our sex. Moreover, these things
never the same - two souls just enough and never, unlike understand exactly? That women to
perfect the art of giving happiness and good deed will command its
own reward.

Miss A. Do you understand, Jenny, what the law is full of women? For
my part I think it is better to stick to the old style, it is said
that "a mill, a clock and a woman always wants to fix." I think women
have their own requirements shortly. Oh, I always forget the old ways.  FRIEDRICH: Oh, please, please, dear Erna, not in that tone
of voice! RITA: What pitch?
FRIEDRICH: Erna! Do not make things so difficult for me.
See, after discovering, finally, through an agency in Berlin, and after hunting for a long time,
which were the famous Revere, I was shocked at first, terribly sad,
and for a moment, I thought give up everything.

My worst fears were over. I was sure you lived in the well, and as I see now in comfortable
circumstances. But instead, had to be prepared that could have grown away the world we live - could
hardly understand each other.
RITA: Hm! I tell you what was his ideal - as he would have liked to be there again?
As a poor seamstress in an attic room, which for four years, had lived in hunger and need -
but respectable, which is the main point. Then type would spread his arms, and the poor, pale
dove would have been grateful embrace.
Are you going to deny I ever imagined as well, and even wanted to him? FRIEDRICH (She looks calmly):
Well, is there anything wrong with that?

RITA: But how did it happen that, regardless of this, this disappointment, which, however, kept
looking for me?
FRIEDRICH: Thank God, at the appropriate time I recalled the clear,
silver laughter, a child.

Just within my small scruples that echoed in my ears, as in the time ridiculed my gravity.  
I
still remember that moment, Erna?

(Rita is silent.) Bertha (comes with a huge bouquet of dark red roses):
My wife - for the account.

RITA (jumps nervously excited): Roses! My dark pink! Give me! Ah! (She keeps Federico and asks)
Did he say anything? Bertha: No, he said nothing, but ---- FRIEDRICH (hits the field, she has
close to his face, aside): I thank you.
RITA (without realizing it, to Bertha): Well? BERTHA (pointing to the field): The Earl has written
something on a card. RITA: Your card?
Where? (She looks among the flowers) Oh, here! (Lee, then gently Bertha) Okay. (Bertha is gone.)
RITA (read again): "Pour prendre Congo."
(With a sigh easy) Yeah, yeah.
FRIEDRICH: What is the problem? RITA: Sad! His education was only half finished and it leaves
me. FRIEDRICH: What do you mean? I do not understand you at all.
RITA (her mind is occupied): It's a shame. Now that will grow completely
stupid. FRIEDRICH (stands important): Erna, he said. What relationship
exists between you and the Count? RITA (laughs): What business is
that of yours? FRIEDRICH (solemn): Erna! Whatever it might have been,
this will do more. Ruhleben (Hurst and Blackett) is another amazing tome containing lots of data about
how English civilian prisoners existed while held captive in Germany. Douglas Sladen tells of
how much they endured and how few amenities they had. The main reason for the success of the assylum for idiots and feeble
minded youth is that the hands behind this excellent charity are
scholars of that time.

One of them was connected with a leading daily paper in this city and some others serves in the
state and national legislatures.

The distinguished townsman, Noah Dow, Esquire donated a large portion of his fortune to this charitable
institute.He stated that he do this because he desires to do some thing for the benefit of
mankind.When he was enquired about the rules and selection procedures of the superintendent,
his reply was that let them select in a way so that he should be pleased, and thus N.E.Howe,Esq
was chosen according to this suggestion.  One hundred aged and decayed gentlemen were privileged
to occupy this assylum. When I asked him why there is no provision for females my friend replied
with a remarkable psychological fact that there is no such thing as a female punster. When
I heard this remark I also had a instinct that such cases are rare in females. When we went
to visit this place I began to ring the bell but my friend asked me to tap the door with stick
instead of ringing the bell. Then an old man with a comical face opened the gate and asked me that you
prefer cane than a bell.Then he began to cough and chuckle rapidly. My friend winked at me and
began to talk to the old man.

When we entered inside the yard a feeble man with bright eyes came up with a serious look.He
said to my friend that there is complaint against this assylum in
the town that it is a gambling establishment.

My friend asked with astonishment what he meant.He answered pointing his fingers towards the
field and laughing that they complain because there are a lot of rye on the premise and he
went away. After entering the main building I noticed the rules and regulations posted on the
wall of assylum.Here are some extracts from this which interested me.

First one is this Everyone is allowed to make pun freely from eight in the morning till ten at
night except during service at chapel and grace before meal.
 We
often hear the saying "Ignorance is bliss." But some authors add: "Skepticism is wisdom."

Quotations that support this idea are the following:
* * * The Protestant oftentimes takes up his open Bible; he wishes
to believe; he tries to believe.

* * * All these efforts avail nothing." Christian Theology and Modern Skepticism, 1872, p.
144.

"The Duke and the Protestant are simply trying to do two things at once; and, naturally, Professor
Huxley is tempted in the same direction." Lay Sermons, p. 21. "But then he is keen enough to
suspect some absurdity in the position, and honestly proclaims that the army of liberal thought
is, at present, in very loose order; and many a spirited freethinker makes use of his freedom
mainly to vent nonsense." Lay Sermons, p. 69.
It is indeed tempting to wallow in a "paradise of illusions." Even if a person gets frustrated
because of the impossibility of his illusions, at least he has lived
with joy and blessings.

In case there is no "hereafter," then the skeptic and the illusionist are placed in equal
footing because there is nothing to look forward to after all. But I shall not take sides.
Our maturity makes us happy people who will not get disappointed with illusions. In the end,
we will find out that what matters is not being able to prove ignorance or illusion. What matters
is that we lived a life of wisdom and lived.
Evolution. DEDICATED TO C.F., DANVILLE, IND.

There has always been a great division between religion and science as to the subject of evolution.

Scientists who reject religion think that they are too intelligent as compared to those who believe
in the Bible, the supposed "uneducated fools." 
Mr. Huxley asks
theologians to let science alone. In the same way, scientists should
also let alone those who are believers in the Bible. Another method of disposal of manure has been recommended by English writers.
The manure pile was constructed in a compact square, whose sides are hit hard with their advice.
Earth around the edges of the stack is made of smooth, hard and loose straw is placed in small
piles around the manure pile about a foot from the edge.

The exclusion of air, along with high temperature and gases formed by fermentation, a tendency to
make bad lot for the development of fly larvae. Those who happen to develop in the surface layer
to migrate and pupate in the ring of mulch around the stack, which will be destroyed by incineration.

REMOVAL AND TREATMENT OF SEVERAL BREEDING SITES.
It is also true under field conditions in cities elsewhere rearing
horse manure to care.

Garbage should be removed, pigs and poultry must be fed, especially on dairy farms, it is extremely
important that all precautions taken to avoid contamination of the milk flies.
It is highly desirable that all waste possible cumulative cities burned. Cremation was practiced
successfully by a number of cities with a population of 10000-15000
and above.

In the big cities due to dead and burning garbage and other debris. If the city and the city's
garbage is sold to municipal authorities pork cables should have control over the sanitary
conditions in the yards of food, as there is great danger of raising planes in those places,
if not kept clean .

Mr. Grover Cleveland:

It was prior to awareness of the bill that the Commissioner of Pensions
appointed a favorable action the way of the claimant when he attempted
to secure unclaimed pension money.

His pension was due to him from September 30 of 1882 and the appropriate
certificate was issued to him in his own name straight from the Commissioner
of Pensions.

Due to the action, in favor of the claimant, the Commissioner stated
to witnesses that he was withholding his signature from the bill.

The problem with the bill was that all pensions to be paid would only be available from the date
of its passage. By withholding his signature the Commissioner kept his word to the man that he
had granted special favor to.

There was, within the bill a named person who had eye disease and neuralgia. The writings in the
bill were awarding him a pension. This person had been forced into the service for one hundred
of duty between May 14 and September 8, 1864. This person had been treated for these conditions
between 1859 and 1864 on a number of occasions and when the officials discovered this indiscretion
in 1880 through information received at the Pension Bureau he was dropped from the list for
receiving pension monies. His receipt of any pension money was extinguished.

In

a later incidence about the same case this individual was allowed to face his accusers and any
of the witnesses that they had called in to testify against him with
evidence of his own innocence.

A Dr. Saunders was one of the physicians who had claimed under oath
that he had treated the man for problems with his eyes or ears, in
1860, which is obviously prior to May 14, 1864.

It was due to this testimony, and six other witnesses who claimed that the man had had eye
trouble prior to enlistment, that the man finally lost his case. The man himself agreed that
he had trouble in one eye, but recovered in 1860 from that occasion of the problem.

For his defense, the man brought in twelve of his neighbors who testified
on his behalf that he had been free from any neuralgia or disease
in his eyes prior to the enlistment date.

This did not win over the opinion of the Commissioner. He went on
to say that all evidence against obtaining this pension under debate
here was most believable and that he was firm in the opinion of it
not being restored even though the bill "I see before me" would allow
a pension. SCENE:

Illuminated paint.
In response to other questions related to this article, we give this
process, William Henry Balmain, the original discoverer of light paint,
and other processes.

These data were obtained letters patent of the State, the name of the country.
Balmain invention was patented in England in the 1877 and in this country in 1882. It is in the form
of improvements in the painting, painting and whitewashing, which has the following characteristics:

The invention consists in a light color, whose body phosphorus compounds, or is part of such a
substance and a vehicle such that it is used as a tool in conventional paint compounds, ie 1,
which becomes dry by evaporation of oxidation.
Article of the enemy, which paint or varnish or rinse is used by itself are visible in a dark
place, more or less capable of transmitting light of other sites in order to make them visible
as well.

In phosphorescent substance found most suitable for this purpose is a mixture obtained by simply
heating together a mixture of limestone and sulfur, or carbonates of lime and sulfur, or some other
substance containing in themselves, and lime sulfur - such as as
alabaster, gypsum and etc. - With carbon or any other agent to remove
part of the oxygen contained therein, or when heated lemon or lime
carbonate gas or vapor containing sulfur.

The vehicle must be used to light the paint should be a kind of dry evaporation or oxidation,
so that paint can not become soft or liquid by heat or should be easily erased by accident or
through the use of devices for which it was applied. It can be any of the cars are widely used
in oil painting or any of those commonly used in the so-called "diseases" whitewash or paint,
depending on the location and purpose, or are afraid to be used.
These are the best results are obtained by mixing a phosphorescent substance with colorless varnish
made from cement or other resinous body and soul or spirit as the
paint as thick as convenient to apply with a brush, and with much
spirit or spirit, can be added without prejudice to the required thickness.

Good results can be obtained from linseed oil, varnishes spirit, glues, pastes, sizes and gelatin
solutions of any kind, the choice of changing to meet the object in view or the nature of the
articles on hand.
The method of applying the paint, varnish, or wash will depend on the circumstances of the case.
For example, it can be applied with a brush, as in conventional painting or by dipping or soaking
the article in the paint, varnish, or wash, or a block or type can
be used for, as in the press and the like.

In foreign policy, or where the surface is illuminated prone to the vagaries of weather or
damage resulting from mechanical circumstances it is desirable to
cover the glass or if the material will admit it, glaze it to flow,
as in the enamel or, as in the ordinary courts, but this can be done
without prejudice to the action, even if the thread or red icing requires
a high temperature for fusion.

Among other applications of the invention said that may be listed,
it is particularly beneficial to provide visible clock or watch parties
and other indicators - such as, for example, compasses and scale of
the barometer and thermometer - at night or in dark places at night.

In applying the invention these and other similar purposes may be used phosphorous bases or dark
shadowy figures in the field of law and phosphorescent numerals or
letters, choose the former.

Additionally, there may be letters and numbers, prepared for use
at home and doors at the edges of the street, where it is not convenient
and cost-effective to have an external light source, traffic signs
and signals, as well as the names or marks to indicate records of
roads and gates, and to like.

The invention also relates to painting with light rail cars with phosphorescent
paint of the interior, thereby eliminating the need for cost and inconvenience
of light passing through the tunnel.

 His situation has become
so depressed. He was suffering as a fish out of water. He will always love to be very active.
But he is maintaining his calmness and obliged to be calm. His glory has become a social bit

As he is a poor person, he will highly enjoy by his companionship with others. He will always avoid

and making his way in. Wow, I thought I was going to crack him up but he cracked my up instead!
And then, bang! Bang! There was shooting all around me... on every side! In order to get out
of the consquences after I let loose on him two times, I left.

I have know idea what happened to him.  The third hunter was cracking up at the thought. I viewed
you falling you crazy guy. At first, I was convinced you were struck. However, when you lifted that
worn face and began to yell "Wor guns!" like crazy, I was convinced there was nothing wrong
with you. Hey guys, look at the guy. It is not likely that a regular load of shot would penetrate
that.
The fourth hunter, who happened to be a military man thought it was absolutely horrendous! If
I had to confront another snipe-like bird, I would rather EVELYN WOOD jerk me about rapidly
for seven days. They shouted, "Snipe to the right! Snipe to the left! Snipe forward! Snipe back!
Get ready--get ready!!" Wow, the bloody place is full of them, I thought. Right away he came
out, as sneaky as propelled by the wind. My bundook shot off on its own. After I hugged most
of an oak tree, I took off! About this time, things were getting way too warm! Then a storm filled with
hail came along and I thought to muself, this party is not worth
it... no thank you--I'm off to find some shelter.

That is about all I can remember. Thank you, Tommy. Would you please pass that bottle of beer
around?
The first hunter was encouraging him. Think about how we are all going out of our way to make
sure that a guy like that comfortable. Delays and efforts in vain continued with the work. The father asked Grandfather for
help with the work. Grandfather grimly shook his head, and uttered, there is almost no way
without the rum. It continued, efforts in vain, and delays.

MR.PUNCH'S PRIZE NOVELS.
NO. XVI. --GERMFOOD.
(BY MARY MORALLY, AUTHOR OF "GINBITTERS!"

"ARDART, "&C., &C.)
[The MS. of this remarkable novel was tied round with scarlet ribbons, and arrived in a case which had
beenonce used for the packing of bottles of rum, or some other potent
spirit.

It is dedicated in highly uncomplimentary terms to "Messieures les Marronnerurs glaces de
Paris."

With it came a most extraordinary letter, from which wemake, without permission, the following
startling extracts. "Ha! Ha! likewise Fe Fo Furn. I smell blood, galloping, panting, whirling,
hurling, throbbing, maddened blood. My brain is on fire, my pen is a flash of lightning. I
see stars, three stars, that is to say, one of the best brands plucked
from the burning.

I'm going to make your flesh creep. I'll give you fits, paralytic fits, epileptic fits, and
fits of hysteria, all at the same time.

Have I ever been Paris? Never. Do I know the taste of absinthe? How dare you ask me such a question?
Am I a women? Ask me another. Ugh! it's coming, the demon is upon me. I must write three murderous
volumes. I must! What was that shriek? and that? Unhand me, snakes! Oh!!!!--MM."]
CHAPTER I.
I was asleep and dreaming--dreaming dreadful, horrible, soul-shattering
dreams--dreams that flung me head-first out of bed, and then flung
me back into bed off the uncarpeted floor of my chamber.

But I did not wake--why should I?--it was unnessary--I wanted to dream--I had to dream and
therefore I dreamt. I was walking home from a cheap restaurant in one of the poorer quarters of
Paris. "Poorer quarters" is a nice vague term.

There are many poorer quarters in a large city.

This was one of them. Let that suffice to he ciritical pedants who
clamour for accuracy and local colour. Accuracy! pah! Shall the soaring
soul of a three-volumer be restrained by the debasing fetters of a
grovelling exactitude? Digestion, which is almost always attent,
is loquacious or quiet, as souls differ.

Then anybody finds his opportunity.
Was not this preamble necessary towards earn you know the charm of
the story, via which a applauded man, already dead, depicted the innocent
jesuistry of ladies, painting it with the subtlety peculiar towards
fellows whom possess sighted much of the earth, and which earns statesmen
such delightful storytellers when, want Prince Talleyrand and Prince
Metternich, they vouchsafe towards tell a story?

 âThe singerâs name is Pasta, but there
is no way that you could have known that, you didnât say anything to make that fact obvious did
you?â  
âOf course not; I followed the advice that you gave
me; when in doubt say nothing.â D.G. Brinton. "The American
Race."

Through several tests, it has been concluded that there is no great
difference between the black and the white when it comes to lower
mental powers.

Both are equally quick in physical reactions.

There is also equality in perceiving and discriminating between different kinds of objects.
There is, however, a difference when it comes to higher facilities,
such as judgment, inventiveness, and the power of organization. For example:
an Arabian deck hand endeavours to alert us that he has sighted a sail approaching the shore.
This is how he phrases his announcement:
I scanned the horizon of this broad and ancient cosm, And in the skyline
and the main, And through those same clouds.

The very same stars gazed I upon in their glimmering, And nothing
further, And, as my spirit heaved with the Spirit of the Earth, Distant
to the North, a gust advanced upon the sea, And, after that generating
wind died, A black jot appeared upon the Firmanent's edge: as observing
On the celestial sphere's join unto my wisdom, the first faltering
inspiration of a heroic deed came to fore.

With impetus and curiosity I focused upon this new sight, And my
expectations seemed to place their mark upon the apparition.

It has not yet come to pass the revelation of exactly What, or from
exactly Where, this apparent bark.

In set pieces that try to be impassioned, we see the same proclivity toward contrivance. What
he gives to us is for sure literary; it is never lacking in that quality, but neither does it
exceed a minimum competence. It is never openly honest or uncompromising. Truth be told, Beddoes
authored purely from the intellect, as a whole, and devoid of affect,
or, perhaps, of whimsy, except maybe in his literature apart from
the Stage.

Every one of Beddoes characters articulate in the same tongue, share the same yearnings; nevertheless
shock us with their zombie-like detachment from human qualities. 'Man is tired of being merely
human,' opines Siegfried in Death's Jest-Book, and Beddoes might be said to have tired of humanity
before he gave it a chance to explain itself.
Viewed from the conventional position, Beddoe's concept of the drama was rather flamboyantly dilettantish.
As a straight-up playwright, he would surely be judged as unworthy of consideration, however one must
consider that he was trying to be something other than conventional, something unique, a kind
of phantasmal, artisitc reverie. He would have acknowledged his debt to Webster and Tourneur,
indeed, to all the cadaverous Elizabethan oeuvre; he would not have
argued that his basis was built on anything else than that of Literature,
and most certainly not upon the naturalness of Life; nonetheless,
he would have asserted, and asserted rightly, that he had given birth
to, out of a plethora of bizarre components, something which has its
niche in English poetry.

Death's Jest-Book just maybe the most monstrous poem to be found in Western Literature. Within
is not to be found a single page without a melancholy, perverse, blithe, or disgusting portrayal of
necrosis. The character of a slave cannot observe that his mistress is taking a nap without transforming
the description into a dissertation on the Grave:
Slumbering, or pretending to slumber. Very nicely done, she. 'slike suiting up with a drape
she is obligated to wear, eventually, for an extended period of time: 'Tis only a tepid, blander
version of Death.

Not Messr. Baudelaire, who loved putrescence; nor Messr. Poe, who preferred the fragrance of graveyard
dirt. Verily, Messr. Beddoes has developed a new Choreography of the Tomb, by way of poetry;
and has become the recorder of the adoration and burlesque of Death. 'Exhausted by the plight
of simply being human', he has populated a drama with undisguised dead people. It is completely
understandable that these erudite orators should fail to engage us with their oratory, that they
should leave us unaffected by the tribulations of their passionate displeasures; they were
never meant to be seen as human, except, to be sure, in the wondrous and mysterious humanity
of Death itself.
Don't coerce me to say it once again, that the perspicacity of Beddoes is not in his playwrighting,
but in his song-writing.

What was in fact most unforced in him (I found nothing purely unforced) was the natural inspiration
of his composition.

EDUCATION IN DENMARK.
Much pain has recently been taken in Denmark to promote the financing of primary schools and
Lancaster have been generally throughout the country. We now have before us the report to the
King of Chevalier Abrahamson, progress, prospects and current status

shows that 2371 was mutual schools created and is full time in the

RECORDS.

Some faint idea of the majority of our English records can be obtained
by noting the fact that a single law, the Commissioners' property
tax law, passed in the first year of the reign of His Majesty's present
action, the more winding hundred feet, or nearly twice the length
of the Cathedral of St. Paul's within the walls, and if you ever need
the volume to hear fear, a healthy man should be employed for three
hours in coiling and uncoiling its folds monstrous.

In case of factory legislation, at this pace and do not believe any disruption in their development,
we may soon be able to belt the ball round with parchment. When the solemn acts run, add requests
showers available (and in more ways than one) on the table every night of the session, the
bills at the end of each quarter, are stacked in piles under custody
of our good friends, six employees of the Foreign Ministry, and countless
membranes, as in all hours of the day, sent the gloomy caves and recesses
of the various courts of common law and criminal jurisdiction throughout
the kingdom, we are afraid that there are many who may think that
time is fast approaching for the surgery, Hugh Peters recommends that
"a good job for a good judge."

 Mr Idle must admit that he was coming to the conclusion on distinct
and logical grounds. After viewing, to his relief, and with many necessary intervals of repose,
the placid, spectacle of his past life, he made a discovery that all of the great disasters
which had tested him in earlier lives had been caused by him letting
himself be decieved into imitating some example of activity and industry
that had been set by others.

The trials he refers to were three, and may be reckoned up. First the disaster of being an
outcast in school, second, the disaster of severe illness, and third, the disaster of befriending
a great bore.
 There was also another having the power and prestige of wealth, being
extremely timid, complacent, and conservative, in fear of any kind of popular rule, particularly
that having to do with a republic.

These two classes had among them those of a very patriotic nature who couldn't see what would
be worth living for beyond their own "tight little island."

When a territory changes its government, it seems to be answering
the call of fate. The clique at the Union in Saratoga came to a settlement with understanding,

Eventhough, wife of Senator conch had arranged for a cottage, Senator
Conch arrived Albamy to have a discussion with Governor.

She was surrounded by all of her friends including the aged Madam
Funchal and her successor, from Philedelphia, and Mrs. Romeo Pipps
Bovis and her husband from Boston.

As she was always in the habit of assembling with them, she was vivacious there, in tune of the
situation.

She, who was wearing white muslin morning dress, described the details to Osgood, who was wearing
his new cream colored shirt and loitering in the reception room of the hall.
 

The work that was exhibited was quite good, and some of it was very choice indeed.
It would seem that the College has never had a better anniversary. Overall, never one as good. But
with continued help, we certainly might hope that results such as these may well be dwarfed by
the greater result of the near future. If you look closely at the gigantic bear's head mounted on the board,
you will see a tiny white object.

 She is silently becoming a great
power. The doctrines or her followers are showing their influence in many places, including
the halls of justice, the churches, and, more importantly, in the souls of men. Many beautiful
and great structures are being built in her honor. Many persecutions have been made in the
past, and are certain to be repeated. Silently and secretely she is honing her many forces to
be prapared for the future time when she strikes. She wishes only
for an advantage, and she is now being give that. "Le Balle" can never be touched with

And with them we search ourselves in touch with living progress of our isle. For an isle it
already was, and with essentially the same area and coasts and bodily attributes as we have
them still.

Our waterways ran in same lowlands, our hammocks rose with identicle course, in those far-off days
as today. And while the place of flint in the arsenal of England was taken first by bronze

got finished and the nex started.

 When this man returned he conveyed me a note from your dad, in which
he said he was going to trial and make his get away, and that he would
not ever afresh set base in Russia.

"'Just at this time my mother died. Your dad was not adept to put his design into execution,
and a year subsequent he was permitted to compose to me, but only
to notify me the situation on which Nicholas I. suggested to permit
his come back from exile.

The Czar had selected a wife for him, and he was to renounce me for
ever.

Your dad supplemented that he was denying such terms; that he would not ever shatter his vow
to me, and favoured exile to what was suggested him. "'He was right!' I called out, arrogantly, for I
was pleased to find that I had no origin to blush for my father  "'It was noble of him!' said
my mother, and her eyes topped up with tears. 'It was noble, but how could I accept such a sacrifice?
I could not; it would have been too selfish. There was only one thing to manage, and whereas in
managing it I had to forfeit all my womanly dignity, my bravery held out. I composed to your
dad, telling him to accept the Czar's offer, as I myself was about to marry.'
"'It was not true?'  No! No! It was to save him. I desired him to be free, to be cheerful if possible.
As for me, all was over.

He drafted to me, reproaching me, and it busted my heart. I did not response to his letter.
I went back to Paris, where I inhabited silently and unfamiliar, committing myself wholly to
you.... Six months afterwards I discovered that he had wedded a Princess as showed by the
will of the Czar, and that he was selected captain.'
"'Is he happy?'
"'I have not ever learned another phrase about him, and as he has no concept of my whereabouts,
he could not ever have made inquiries about me. Now you understand all, you understand the origin
of my unhappiness and the mystery of your birth. You should now referee between your dad and
your mother, and either pardon or accuse us, for, alas! my poor young
man, you have no title and no future.' 
"My poor mother hid her
face in her hands and sobbed in an agony of grief.

"'I have not anything to pardon, mother; but if you desire me to referee my dad and you,
I can only state that you both did your obligation and that your forfeit was sublime. Society
makes regulations at its own delight, but in the view of God, who certainly is over all, your wedding
ceremony was legitimate, and I have not anything to be embarrassed of.
 

Not only do they say that he has a desired bum, but the Prince is generous with his money the
next morning. And that is how he's won the hearts of his shipmates. Let us decide whether real-life information backs up this supposition.

Hankford was a Judge of the Common Pleas before Henry V's reign, but was omitted from the new patents
when Henry V ascended to the throne. These patents were not issued until the 2nd day of May,
perhaps two days before Easter Term. But in the yearbook reports of the Easter - and Trinity
- term, we find Hankford's name. And not as merely acting in the Common Pleas, but ruling the
King's Bench.

Moreover, though Gascoigne was summoned to the first parliament on the 22nd day of March, yet
on May 15, he was not at the parliament's meeting; further, his usual post was filled by Sir William
Hankford, who was placed in a position of importance higher than the Chief Justice of the Common
Pleas, one Sir William Thirning.
This information, inconsistent with Dugdale's date, made it necessary to refer to the roll. Thanks
to Mr. Duffus Hardy, this has been checked; and the result is that
the date of Hankford's appointment shifts back to March 29, 1413;
eight days after King Henry acceded to the throne and ten days before
he was crowned.

The timeframe and haste of Hankford's appointment contrasts with the
delay in the issuing of patents to the other judges makes the argument
that Gascoigne's choice of appointing Hankford had less to do with
the act than King Henry's decision.

Not to mention the royal warrant issued by Henry V more than a year later, giving Hankford
four bucks and four does a year for the rest of his life. This proof of Henry V's good will towards
Hankford clearly offsets the impression created by his early removal.
With all of this information we have, King Henry's supposed favour towards Gascoigne by renominating
the gentleman to his position is of no credit. But, even supposing none of this had been known,
I myself must admit my own surprise that anyone would say Gascoigne
was ever Chief Justice to Henry V when there is clearly proof to the
contrary in the two records existing before him.

The first record is on the Issue Roll of July 1413, in which Gascoigne is called "late Chief Justice
of the Bench of Lord Henry, father of the present King."
 King Louis and his Ministers forsake Friedrich due to a series of bad
accidents. They did not intend such a thing.

What practical contriving, diplomatic spider-weaving, brain-beating, for that object; especially
now! Cardinal Tencin, Belleisle, Rothenburg, Noailles and the high-minded unfortunate mistress Chateauroux,
who admires Friedrich, as they say; have thrown out Amelot, but not for stammering alone. This
new Chatearuous Ministry are able, almost high people; and already show results.
No, whay is the most important, France has gotten a real General to her Armies (unconciously, or
by help of Noailles): Comte de Saxe, now known as Marechal de Saxe, who will shine in these
Netherland operations, counter-shone by Wades, D'Ahrembergs, Cumberlands, now and in the Four
following years.
Noailles had always recognized Comte de Saxe and had long striven for him in official quaters.
Here in official quaters, the light of him is unveiled at last and
set on high: loyal Noailles.

The year 1744 was when Louis XV, urged by Chateaurous, the high-wouled unfortunate female, appearing
in person at the head of this troops. "Go, Sire, go, Mon Chou (and I will accompany); show yourself
where a king shold be, at the head of your troops; be a second Louis-le-Grand!" she cried.
Which, with Chateaurous, he did; actually he went to the Netherlands,
with baggage-train immeasurable, including cooks and play-actors with
their thunder-barrels (off from Paris, May 3d) and to the admiration
of the Universe. [Adelung, iv. 113; Barbier, ii. The theorists have so completely
mapped out the rightful resources of the composer, and have so prescribed his course in nearly
every possible position, that music is made to be an arithmatic puzzle
than the unfetterred result of emotions and Ã¦sthetics. But it is towards another end; for there he assures exceeding
and permanent joy as soon as a type, although it appear trouble. But here is the hassle long
and vehement, albeit the fruit of it was not suddenly espied.

He speaks none doubt of that long and dolorous moment of their captivity, within which they continually
laboured for delivery, but elicited it not ahead of the finalise end of seventy years. During
which moment, the earth, that is, the land of Judah, which occasionally
was sanctified unto God, but was otherwise granted towards be profaned
via wicked civilians, got none assistance, nor listened any deliverance:
for the population of the earth collapsed not; that is, the tyrants
and oppressors of Godâs civilians were not robbed away, but still
remained and persisted blasphemers of God, and troublers of his church.

But because I listen the hours towards traverse many swiftly than they possess appeared at else
moments, I ought contract that which remains of this text into certain points.
The prophet former asserts against the show despair; later he introduces
God himself phoning upon his people; and, last of everybody, he ensures
his afflicted, that God shall arrive, and require fund of everybody
the blood-thirsty tyrants of the earth.

The prophet here pierces across everybody impediments that nature could object; and, via the victory
of religion, he overcomes, not alone the ordinary enemies, but the great and last enemy of everybody,
mortality itself; for this would he say, Lord, I see nothing for thy picked, but dejection
towards pursue dejection, and one affliction towards succeed another; yea, within the end I
see, that mortality shall eat thy dearest children. But yet, O Lord!
 A couple of days later I saw a few nests belonging to
some Martins near a blind window on Islington-Green.

That same year, on September 20, I saw several birds flying on the wind. This was from the window

"She is a Dutchman,sir" said the officer.The commander peeps through the periscope. The Dutchman
was heading towards a continental port as it had no wireless.

Ultimately a wrong decision to attack every Dutch submarine because
many German submarine have already committed this mistake leading
to disaster. Obviously we have a better hunt the great writer's
hands, expect a picture, Coleridge's more, of whom he had relatively little of this right.

writings.

Children's books: "SANDFORD and Merton." - Children's books at that

 Interest free loans are given for

country people are given in the following ways:-

(a) Free loans of books to libraries controlled by the local authorities
so that they do not charge any thing for using the library and maintain
the reasonable standard of library.

(b) Loans with a very little charge to independent subscription public libraries, charged on each
set of 50 books.
(c) Loans of books to isolated group of readers at a small annual charge through hamper collections.
(d) Free loans of books for lighthouse keepers and very remote

ago to place a bill authorizing the city of Boston to acquire land within its own limits for
the development of parks and cooperate with the adjoining towns in
laying down the parks for the benefit of the citizens on both side
of the line.

This bill was passed by big majority in the both houses. Such measures are always opposed; this
was opposed on the plea that this will lead to jobbery and extravagance.

Such recreational activity always leads to such a situation of jobbery and extravagance, but it
is always for the citizens and the government of Boston to decide the faith they have in the
honesty and truthfulness of the job. Another argument was that the people of Boston already have
beautiful suburbs, sufficient enough to provide clean air and beautiful atmosphere. This might
be true for the affluent society as they have wealth which enables them to travel by their
own carriers, but what about the working class. The major population of people who travel over
more than an hour in crowded street transport in the surrounding
dusty atmosphere.

Another argument was about affordability which city of Boston may find expensive in development
of these luxury parks. This argument was countered with the reply that city of Boston is already
spending on prisons and jails and millions being spent on liquor and other useless activities,
it can afford to spend money on such peaceful activities, which are going to benefit health and
enhance the enjoyment level of people. Just in a word, this became a law and subsequently
a commission was appointed by the city of Boston. The dignitaries who were nominated in the commission
are already in your hearts; hence I will not name them. The report of the commission is already
with you and our main objective is to endorse this report, so that
the implementation by the city of Boston is initiated as per the suggestion
of this report.

This is obvious that that all the points suggested by the report are not approved by everyone
and also all the actions cannot be carried by the government, but the report is so satisfying that
we cannot do anything but recommend the municipal authorities to implement it in total. [Applause]
This now my friends, is the duty of those who succeed me to give you reasons and arguments
for your actions this time. Being the representative of the city of Boston and a resident for the
past thirty years, I call upon you tonight to endorse and to commend this admirable system of
our government. [Applause] SPEECH OF MR.GEORGE B CHASE MR.PRESIDENT- On behalf of the committee
who have had in charge the arrangements for this meeting, I have the honor to offer for its
acceptance several resolutions which have been prepared for it by
a gentleman, than whom none is more versed in all that relates to
the business questions and interests of the city of Boston, and who,
during long and faithful service as secretary of the Board of Trade,
became familiar with all subjects relating to the development and
prosperity of the city.

"My poor dear, you're worn out. Go lie down. The princess lay next door.

The door was open and through the silk curtain drawn before it, prince Firoze Shaw could be
seen advancing on top-toe to avoid waking the eunuchs. He drew back the curtain, and without
even pausing to gaze in awe at the splendour of the room, he immeaditely focussed on finding the
princess.

There were many beds on the floor, but only one raised upon a sofa. The princess slept in the
raised bed, her attendents on the floor.

He crept softly to the raised bed, careful to wake neither the princess
nor her attendents. The princesses beauty was so great that just with
a single look, he became bewitched and consumed by love. TRUBERRY is one of the kindest by which quality
he helps human beings in the best way possible.

With IRRITATION in the higher degree TRUBERRY never knows or will know that he was nearing
destruction though I mastered the impulse much in this matter. 

Finally got over my disgust enough to use Maitre Mouche.

The first thing I noticed was that his office is much more dusty and musty, much more this
year than last year.

The notary made his appearance after a moment, her family stiff gestures and shaking his restless
eyes behind glasses. I made my complaints to him.

He told me .... But why I write, even in a notebook that I'll burn my memories of a scoundrel
frankly?

He takes sides with Miss prefer, whose sharp mind and impeccable character who has long appreciated.
He does not feel able to decide the nature of the disputed question,
but he assures me that appearances must have been very much against
me. Yet I reasoned sans the pithy beach envy that
coats the innate unity of the fisherman.

Not one of the men took too much advantage of her. Not one of the men cared for her. She was
a controversy that both were afraid to discover more about.

"Is it you, Dorothy?" The struggle was an unexpected one but it was significant,through
the thrilling courses of successes and failures.In the month of july
I got a company whose name was Felix Drasecke, and whom I don't know
before.

He had come Lucerne for a long visit. When he heard a performance of the prelude to Tristan
und Isolde conducted by Liszt, he decided to stay with me.

I was not interested in his silly talking and he began to bore me.

When he understood I was not fascinated by his visit he planned to
go back after a few days.

This made me embarrassed and I tried to impress him becuase I did'nt
like him to have a bad opinion about me.

Slowly I began to like him and until his return from Luceme, he was
my daily companion.

He was a fantastic musician even though he was not a well behaved man.  After his return came
Wilhelm Baumgarner who was my old Zurich connection and spend a few weeks with me in Luceme just to show
kindness towards me. After that Alexander Seroff from St.Petersburg came to live in my neighbourhood.He
was a person of great intelligence and he has a liking for Liszt
and to me.

I played Tristan for him in my peculiar way.

Then I went to Mount Pilatus with Drasecke, and I have to spend a few more days with a person
who suffered from giddiness.

After that to celebrate his return we made a excursion to Brunnen and Grutli.He took leave from
me as he was short of money and I also planned for my departure.  I sent letters to Eduard
Devrient and then to Grand Duke of Baden, asking guarantee for settling in Karlsruhe itself or
in its neighbourhood. The reason for this is that I cannot suppress the wish to have intercourse
with an orchestra and a company of singers just to hear them play. Later I understood that Grand
Duke himself written to the king of Saxony for this. But I was not granted amnesty but could
only get an act of grace. For this I have to report to the magistrate for examination. As my wish
remained unfulfilled I have to search a way to secure a performance
of my Tristan which I could supervise myself.

Grand Duke assured me a means to meet the situation
 She is shown how to make it as she hears the sound. At right moment her fatger leaves
home,Lines writes to him,receives and is able to read his answer,printed her own in Romantic
capitals.She has learned and the reading is accomplished as he sends
her a picture book and she is helped to see how letters resemble those.

In England Miss Dale's phonic method is best known probably.It is very ingenious,the analysisis
thorough and the books are really got up,but those who feel that reading,though a most valuable
tool, but the tool is not for children under seven years, the method
seems over-elaborate.Much depends on the  teacher but to see fifty
children sitting still while one child places the letters in their
places on the board suggests a great deal of lost time.The system
is also so rigidly phonic that it is a long time before a child can
pick up a ordinary book with any profit. 
stanley Hall holds that
it is best to cobine the methods,and most of us do this."The growing
agreement"is,he says,"that there is no one and only orthodox way of
teaching and learning is greatest and hardest of all the arts,in which
many important parts of our body must train the others to automatic
perfection,in ways hard and easy,by devices old and latest,mechanically
and consciously,actively and passively...this is a great gain and
seems now secure.while a good pedagogic method is one of the most
economic--both of labour and of money--of all inventions,the brightest
children should be never neglected,and indeed most children,if taught
at home or individually,very few methods of refinements are needed.Idiots,as
Mr.Seguin first showed,need and profit greatly by very extended methods
in learning how to walk,feed and dress themselves,which would only
retard a normal child.

Above all it get idea in mind that the stated use of any method does not preclude the incidental
use of any and perhaps of all others."
education by Life were we can find adaptation of phonic combined with
the word method.Being combined with word method ,it is simpler than
miss Dale's,children get much more quickly to real stories.Stanley
Hall advocates the individual teaching of reading,and have found that
once the children know some sounds,in individual learning there is
great advantage,but class teachin has its own advantages also it seems
bestto have a combination.Long since we taught a boy who was mentally
deficient and incapable of intelligent analysis,by all the words with
corresponding pictures.Miss payne has developed to great extent.In
solving puzzles it is practically an appeal.The children choose their
own pictures and are supplied with envelopes containing either single
sounds,or whole words corresponding with the picture.They lay h on
the house,g on the girl,p on the pond,and later do the same with words.They
certainly enjoy it,and no one is ever been waiting.sometimes the puzzle
is to set in order the words of a nursery rhyme which they already
know, sometimes it is to read and draw everything required.



The old fellow sagely shook his head. 

I can't stand em!

Please don't handle it, Geoffrey Rose said.
Let it be, Geoff said Ed. You've got your stuff, and Rose has her
own. I can't see the amusement of dolly's personally, like her, and
no one will mess with her with me around to defend her. If the Arunta recognize the need for prior preparation,
then they are not as ignorant as they are considered and their perspective is produced, not so much
of ignorance Stark, and their philosophy of eternal reincarnation
Primary human spirit.

Arunta philosophers, in fact, seem to focus on one point that puzzled speculation Mr Shandy.
How animating principle, or soul, considered as insignificant, are clothed in flesh? material
acts can make a spiritual incarnation. Therefore, women enter free spirit, and not a direct result
of human action.
Southeastern tribes with female descent of Totem, and without faith
in the universal and constant reincarnation of ancestral spirits,
to take the "schylean, according to Mr. Howitt, who is only concerned
originating male children, while female recipient and is only "assistance".

These tribes, socially more advanced than the Arunta, not ignorance of the facts of procreation
Arunta, an ignorance that we regard only as a consequence and corollary of the Arunta philosophy
of reincarnation. Every child Arunta, through this philosophy was to be, because Alcheringa:
his mother since it reproduces only prepared after "." He is not
a new thing, it is as old as the development of organic forms.

This is the faith Arunta, and I have it does not count as more primitive than the philosophy
of reincarnation of ancestral spirits specific.

Of course, such a design philosophy clearly can not be primitive. It is, however, philosophy
Urabunna tribes on Lake Eyre (with female descent of totem), the
northern most tribes with male descent.

But among any of these tribes has this great philosophy in the totemic
institutions which, through a separate and isolated addition, it has
septs among the Arunta nation, and in a limited way among Kaitish.

Of all these tribes, except the child inherits his totem from the
mother, among Urabunna, from father to northern peoples.

But among the Arunta and Kaitish, totem is not inherited from each parent. According to the
faith of these tribes, each county is a place where the first human ancestors - in each case, all
of a totem, whichsoever that Totem, in each case, it may happen to be - has died, "went under
ground. "Stones and trees appeared to mark such spots.


"Well, good-by, Miss Purnell," said Trowbridge one day, smiling and yet with a curiously pathetic

REACHING BY THE HOLDS AT BORDEAUX

Once we attained Bordeaux, which accepted at once get an fastness
by the Royalists, we comprised accepted along the dwellers on an receive
which resembled what aspring demoed to allies and delivers, besides
to an alien troops. 

It was towards be wished none harm had occurred towards him!" Such was the weight of the conversation
till--when at about an hour ahead of midnight the party burst up--Alessandro Malfi remarked,
that towards allay the tensions of his wife, whom was getting extremely
alarmed approximately her brother, he would saunter as far as Forni--which
was the name of Gaspar's farm--to inquire what had become of him.

As Ripa's distance lay within the equivalent direction, they naturally activated together; and
as soon as what appears towards possess been a very quiet walk--for
the spirits of Giuseppe were so depressed that the else located it
impossible towards draw him into conversation--they reached Forni,
when, having stair the bell, they were currently resolved via Antonio
Guerra, whom put his brain out of an upper window towards inquire
whom they were, and what they wanted.

"It is I, Alessandro Malfi.

I need towards know whereas your master is, and why he has not been towards my house this
evening as he promised?"
"I idea he was there," remarked Antonio; "he predetermined off from
here towards go soon as soon as seven o'clock."

"That is most extraordinary!" replaced Malfi; "what within the earth can possess become of
him?"
"It is very strange, certainly," resolved the servant; "he has never arrive home; and when
you rang I idea it was he replaced from the party."
As there was none many towards be knowledgeable, the two allies already
parted; Malfi voicing extensive secret and a number of uneasiness
at the non-appearance of his brother-in-law: whilst of Giuseppe we
hear nothing many till the consecutive afternoon, when, whilst at
profession within his vineyard, he was accosted via two officers of
law from Aquila, and he located himself arrested, below an accusation
of having waylaid Mendez within a mountain-pass onto the preceding
evening, and injured him, with the design of taking his life.

The former vocabulary Ripa spoken onto hearing this impeachment--words
that, want everybody the lie down of his behavior, told dreadfully
against him--were: "Isn't he dead, then?"

"No thank you towards you that he's not," answered the officer; "but
he's existence, and necessarily towards retrieve towards grant evidence
against his assassin."

"Dio!" cried Giuseppe, "I wish I'd known he wasn't dead!"
"You confess, otherwise, that you injured him with the purpose towards kill?" "No," resolved Ripa; "I
confess none such thing.

As I was going across the traverse last night I saw a man's hat lying a little off the route, and
onto lifting it, I observed it belonged towards SeÃ±or Mendez. Whilst I was wondering how it
arrived there without the owner, and was glancing approximately for him, I spied him lying rear
a boulder.
