One guest only resided generally, if not constantly, at the Castle of Avenel. This was Henry
Warden, who now felt himself less able for the stormy task imposed on the reforming clergy;
and having by his zeal given personal offence to many of the leading nobles and chiefs, did
not consider himself as perfectly safe, unless when within the walls of the strong mansion
of some assured friend. [29] Medusa, one of the three Gorgons. At first it was very beautiful and had a hair magnificent,
but, having offended the goddess Minerva, it irritated her hair changed in frightening snakes.

[31] Juan Bautista Vermay (1784-1833), French painter who came to Cuba to restore some pictures of
the Cathedral of Havana. Protected by Bishop Sword, Captain General
Vives and other influential people, was established in Havana. He
was the founder and first director Academy of San Alejandro. [Footnote: The tracts which appeared
in the Disputation between the Scottish Reformer and Quentin Kennedy, Abbot of Crosraguel,
are among the scarcest in Scottish Bibliography. See M'Crie's Life of Knox, p. 258.] But the
engrossing nature of his occupation rendered the theologian not the most interesting companion
for a solitary female; and his grave, stern, and absorbed deportment, which seldom showed any
interest, except in that which concerned his religious profession, made his presence rather
add to than diminish the gloom which hung over the Castle of Avenel. To superintend the tasks
of numerous female domestics, was the principal part of the Lady's daily employment; her spindle
and distaff, her Bible, and a solitary walk upon the battlements of the castle, or upon the
causeway, or occasionally, but more seldom, upon the banks of the little lake, consumed the
rest of the day. 

Ah! Poor Pas! How to explain to me now that their husbands sent to Madrid to play the role of dairy
cows, making the marriage blessing and fruit in a trade or merchandise is! And how sorry they
had to portray them in consciousness, a few nights ago, the cruel as follows, in a letter that
went to our friend !..... Crusade * * * Languid Pas irrigated farming
vegetables and eat them both cheeks in Madrid's famous female Pas.

      ViÃ©rasla
    
    here among chotos and calves, plowing,
      planting, take ..... Always at your back The
    basket full of kids !..... Or, dancing in the
    fields of emerald, Sundays and holidays, find
      her, with her braids longer than the skirt,
    thick bones, cold stares, and chest
    overflowing bra, Rica promise of robust offspring.
      But oh vile calculation !..... Looking only
    advantage in love, postage paid, Open

      without the child after they amount Announce
    fresh milk in the daily, the stepmothers
    beautiful court! * * * But back to
      the ball of the day of San Roque. The Basques
    who work on the railroad, played the flute in
    boxwood rough-hewn, with separate ranch as they say, and danced to
the Pas with more grace and animation.

The crescent moon and on the decline appeared to preside over the
pathetic moments of the evening.

The river and the forest sprang mysterious concert with the waters,
plants and animals gave her farewell to the day.

In the distance sounded the bells of the cattle and the last shot of the weary hunter, while
the tops of the mountains shone the fire of the pastors and modulated languid wind sobs that
seemed the distant murmur of Madrid ..... But tell me: - When you get to Santander, the capital
of the province, announced the end of your trip? Arrive, my friend, when we finish the piece
of rail to Los Corrales Torrelavega, we work tirelessly, through
gambling and prophecies, all the inhabitants of this valley, from
the distinguished family construction (English for more precise),
to my humble person, who has nailed more than a spike seating rails
.....-- So have another week of patience.

VII .-- PREMIERE OF A RAILWAY DISASTER * * * We were half a league of our journey to opening:
we had just come into the Valley of Buelna, back from Santander:
We only four minutes of walking through the plain, to shake hands
with those who anxiously awaited us, with Champagne bottles to half-open,
and celebrate the opening of this section of the railway ..... We
spent the last fill - also the last, for having concluded that morning.

 Halbert
and I had then spent our life peacefully in his native glen, undisturbed by the phantoms either
of fear or of ambition. His greatest pride had then been to show the fairest herd in the Halidome;
his greatest danger to repel some pilfering snatcher from the Border; and the utmost distance
which would have divided us, would have been the chase of some outlying deer. But, alas! what
avails the blood which Halbert has shed, and the dangers which he encounters, to support a
name and rank, dear to him because he has it from me, but which we shall never transmit to
our posterity! with me the name of Avenel must expire."

She sighed as the reflections arose, and, looking towards the shore of the lake, her eye was
attracted by a group of children of various ages, assembled to see a little ship, constructed
by some village artist, perform its first voyage on the water. 

Colorado was a rider; not as a pepper, but rather as a strawberry, giving individuals their own inspirations.
The youngest and most sensitive, the children, seemed to not refute the religious traces. Although
the waiter was covered with yellow dust, raised from the trotting of a pony, his uniform
was finely-tailored black cloth. It was loosely cut, and had a grace which distinguishes the clothes
of the servants of the church. The sight of their sports pressed on the mind of the childless
Lady of Avenel.

"Why are none of these prattlers mine?" she continued, pursuing the tenor of her melancholy
reflections. "Their parents can scarce find them the coarsest food--and I, who could nurse
them in plenty, I am doomed never to hear a child call me mother!"

The thought sunk on her heart with a bitterness which resembled envy, so deeply is the desire
of offspring implanted in the female breast. She pressed her hands together as if she were
wringing them in the extremity of her desolate feeling, as one whom Heaven had written childless.
A large stag-hound of the greyhound species approached at this moment, and attracted perhaps
by the gesture, licked her hands and pressed his large head against them. He obtained the desired
caresses in return, but still the sad impression remained.

"Wolf," she said, as if the animal could have understood her complaints, "thou art a noble
and beautiful animal; but, alas! the love and affection that I long to bestow, is of a quality
higher than can fall to thy share, though I love thee much."

And, as if she were apologizing to Wolf for withholding from him any part of her regard, she
caressed his proud head and crest, while, looking in her eyes, he seemed to ask her what she
wanted, or what he could do to show his attachment. 

Arched eyebrows, look between apathetic and curious, ambiguous answer in dialect:

- The little run of a dog ....

We are fresh, he thought the traveler, if you could not quite figure out what a dog on a walk
career suspected that should be enough for a horse. Finally, in arriving at the cruise would
Pazos de Ulloa ..... Everything is back to find the shortcut, right ..... Or signs. The sidewalk
widening, by land is mountainous and dotted with patches of oak and the occasional brown still
laden with fruit: a left and right, briar thickets grew scattered and obscure. Indefinable malaise
experienced rider, excusable in whom, born and raised in a quiet, sleepy town, is first compared
to face with the harsh and majestic solitude of nature, and recalls
stories of travelers stolen, people killed in desert places.

- Which
country of wolves! - Said to himself, gloomily impressed.

Alegrósele the soul with the view shortcut, right to be discerned, narrow slope between a double
fence of stone, limit of two mountains. Down relying on the morning of jaco to prevent tripping,
when he saw almost within reach of his hand something that made him shudder: a wooden cross,
painted black with white fillets, medium and over the seawall fall that sustained it. The priest
knew that these crosses mark the spot where a man died violent death, and, crossing himself,
prayed an Our Father, while the horse, no doubt sniffing the trail of a fox, shaking slightly steep
ears, and adopted a trot fearful that soon led him to a crossroads. Among the framework that
the branches were a huge brown, there stood the cruise.

Tosco, common stone, wrought so bad at first glance seemed Romanesque monument by but in reality
was only a century date, still the work of a stonemason with pushes sculptor, the cruise, in that
place and such time and under the natural canopy of the magnificent tree was poetic and beautiful.
The rider, subdued and full of devotion, gave discovered: "Adorámoste, Christ, and bless you because
by your Holy Cross you have redeemed the world", and incidentally
that said, his eyes looking far away the Pazos de Ulloa, which should
be one large building rectangular, with towers, back in the valley. With the wonderful instinct which these
noble animals have so often displayed in the like circumstances, he swam straight to the spot
where his assistance was so much wanted, and seizing the child's under-dress in his mouth,
he not only kept him afloat, but towed him towards the causeway. (N. of E.) [32] Christmas child, celebrated the night of December

Situated behind the Palace of Administration, this was a correctional
institution for slaves who were deemed rebellious by written order
of their masters.

The most common form of punishment was whipping and this often went on for two or three days.

His dress was of the meanest sort, but his long curled hair, and the noble cast of his features,
partook not of that poverty of appearance. The proudest noble in Scotland might have been yet
prouder could he have called that child his heir. (N.
