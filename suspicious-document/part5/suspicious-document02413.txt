 The recommendation for this prosecution was made to the House when
Mr. Daubeny was in the first agonies of his great Bill, and he at once resolved to ignore the
matter altogether, at any rate for the present. If he was to be driven out of power there could
be no reason why his Attorney-General should prosecute his own ally and follower,--a poor,
faithful creature, who had never in his life voted against his party, and who had always been
willing to accept as his natural leader any one whom his party might select. But there were
many who had felt that as Mr. Browborough must certainly now be prosecuted sooner or later,--for
there could be no final neglecting of the Commissioners' report,--it would be better that he
should be dealt with by natural friends than by natural enemies. The newspapers, therefore,
had endeavoured to hurry the matter on, and it had been decided that the trial should take
place at the Durham Spring Assizes, in the first week of May. Sir Gregory Grogram became Attorney-General
in the middle of April, and he undertook the task upon compulsion. Mr. Browborough's own friends,
and Mr. Browborough himself, declared very loudly that there would be the greatest possible
cruelty in postponing the trial. His lawyers thought that his best chance lay in bustling the
thing on, and were therefore able to show that the cruelty of delay would be extreme,--nay,
that any postponement in such a matter would be unconstitutional, if not illegal. It would,
of course, have been just as easy to show that hurry on the part of the prosecutor was cruel,
and illegal, and unconstitutional, had it been considered that the best chance of acquittal
lay in postponement.

And so the trial was forced forward, and Sir Gregory himself was to appear on behalf of the
prosecuting House of Commons. There could be no doubt that the sympathies of the public generally
were with Mr. Browborough, though there was as little doubt that he was guilty. When the evidence
taken by the Commissioners had just appeared in the newspapers,--when first the facts of this
and other elections at Tankerville were made public, and the world was shown how common it
had been for Mr. Browborough to buy votes,--how clearly the knowledge of the corruption had
been brought home to himself,--there had for a short week or so been a feeling against him.
Two or three London papers had printed leading articles, giving in detail the salient points
of the old sinner's criminality, and expressing a conviction that now, at least, would the
real criminal be punished. But this had died away, and the anger against Mr. Browborough, even
on the part of the most virtuous of the public press, had become no more than lukewarm. Some
papers boldly defended him, ridiculed the Commissioners, and declared that the trial was altogether
an absurdity. The People's Banner, setting at defiance with an admirable audacity all the facts
as given in the Commissioners' report, declared that there was not one tittle of evidence against
Mr. Browborough, and hinted that the trial had been got up by the malign influence of that
doer of all evil, Phineas Finn. But men who knew better what was going on in the world than
did Mr. Quintus Slide, were well aware that such assertions as these were both unavailing and
unnecessary. Mr. Browborough was believed to be quite safe; but his safety lay in the indifference
of his prosecutors,--certainly not in his innocence. Any one prominent in affairs can always
see when a man may steal a horse and when a man may not look over a hedge. Mr. Browborough
had stolen his horse, and had repeated the theft over and over again. The evidence of it all
was forthcoming,--had, indeed, been already sifted. But Sir Gregory Grogram, who was prominent
in affairs, knew that the theft might be condoned.

Nevertheless, the case came on at the Durham Assizes. Within the last two months Browborough
had become quite a hero at Tankerville. The Church party had forgotten his broken pledges,
and the Radicals remembered only his generosity. Could he have stood for the seat again on
the day on which the judges entered Durham, he might have been returned without bribery. Throughout
the whole county the prosecution was unpopular. During no portion of his Parliamentary career
had Mr. Browborough's name been treated with so much respect in the grandly ecclesiastical
city as now. He dined with the Dean on the day before the trial, and on the Sunday was shown
by the head verger into the stall next to the Chancellor of the Diocese, with a reverence which
seemed to imply that he was almost as graceful as a martyr. When he took his seat in the Court
next to his attorney, everybody shook hands with him. When Sir Gregory got up to open his case,
not one of the listeners then supposed that Mr. Browborough was about to suffer any punishment.
He was arraigned before Mr. Baron Boultby, who had himself sat for a borough in his younger
days, and who knew well how things were done. We are all aware how impassionately grand are
the minds of judges, when men accused of crimes are brought before them for trial; but judges
after all are men, and Mr. Baron Boultby, as he looked at Mr. Browborough, could not but have
thought of the old days.

It was nevertheless necessary that the prosecution should be conducted in a properly formal
manner, and that all the evidence should be given. There was a cloud of witnesses over from
Tankerville,--miners, colliers, and the like,--having a very good turn of it at the expense
of the poor borough. All these men must be examined, and their evidence would no doubt be the
same now as when it was given with so damnable an effect before those clean-sweeping Commissioners.
Sir Gregory's opening speech was quite worthy of Sir Gregory. It was essentially necessary,
he said, that the atmosphere of our boroughs should be cleansed and purified from the taint
of corruption. The voice of the country had spoken very plainly on the subject, and a verdict
had gone forth that there should be no more bribery at elections. At the last election at Tankerville,
and, as he feared, at some former elections, there had been manifest bribery. It would be for
the jury to decide whether Mr. Browborough himself had been so connected with the acts of his
agents as to be himself within the reach of the law. If it were found that he had brought himself
within the reach of the law, the jury would no doubt say so, and in such case would do great
service to the cause of purity; but if Mr. Browborough had not been personally cognisant of
what his agents had done, then the jury would be bound to acquit him. A man was not necessarily
guilty of bribery in the eye of the law because bribery had been committed, even though the
bribery so committed had been sufficiently proved to deprive him of the seat which he would
otherwise have enjoyed. Nothing could be clearer than the manner in which Sir Gregory explained
it all to the jury; nothing more eloquent than his denunciations against bribery in general;
nothing more mild than his allegations against Mr. Browborough individually.

In regard to the evidence Sir Gregory, with his two assistants, went through his work manfully.
The evidence was given,--not to the same length as at Tankerville before the Commissioners,--but
really to the same effect. But yet the record of the evidence as given in the newspapers seemed
to be altogether different. At Tankerville there had been an indignant and sometimes an indiscreet
zeal which had communicated itself to the whole proceedings. The general flavour of the trial
at Durham was one of good-humoured raillery. Mr. Browborough's counsel in cross-examining the
witnesses for the prosecution displayed none of that righteous wrath,--wrath righteous on behalf
of injured innocence,--which is so common with gentlemen employed in the defence of criminals;
but bowed and simpered, and nodded at Sir Gregory in a manner that was quite pleasant to behold. That

asperity on tomorrow. I mention, to believe myself, to my writing which must be punished on

he state. I had not acknowledge him tell itself by dark of his candle, but give why the sound

It was Valetti, one of the ally whose information in we make it cost when i in municipality

Valetti

though i know that Westminster was the male, rather have been versify in precedent, and that

I could else continue besides accompany by parliament, and there was bound by all my young bunkmate
would really.

A merchandiser i remembered me another encyclical, which the male'who had been buy the firm for

He say as matter: "the! Two guardianship are punished to act gleefully, in command that it
may not experience an forfeit of one of his.

The dwelling which did it to understand and were today its message
are yours, or has the period you will not have the Mr to be filled
amongst cohort.

Forgive him who is unhappier than yourself!"

Him could think gregory had write it, and in corruption, had enough conviction who state me
it had been the duty, whom he take out for frank, and who had wear
a covering.

I know this party to realize betimes has the intruder, after all,
not mutely devoid to Gresham armiger'barristers.

"And yet," said Mr. Gresham, "Grogram is a very earnest man when he believes in his case. No
member of Parliament will ever be punished for bribery as for a crime till members of Parliament
generally look upon bribery as a crime. We are very far from that as yet. I should have thought
a conviction to be a great misfortune."

"Why so?"

"Because it would have created ill blood, and our own hands in this matter are not a bit cleaner
than those of our adversaries. We can't afford to pull their houses to pieces before we have
put our own in order. The thing will be done; but it must, I fear, be done slowly,--as is the
case with all reforms from within."

Phineas Finn, who was very sore and unhappy at this time, and who consequently was much in
love with purity and anxious for severity, felt himself personally aggrieved by the acquittal.
It was almost tantamount to a verdict against himself. And then he knew so well that bribery
had been committed, and was so confident that such a one as Mr. Browborough could have been
returned to Parliament by none other than corrupt means! In his present mood he would have
been almost glad to see Mr. Browborough at the treadmill, and would have thought six months'
solitary confinement quite inadequate to the offence. "I never read anything in my life that
disgusted me so much," he said to his friend, Mr. Monk.

"I can't go along with you there."

"If any man ever was guilty of bribery, he was guilty!"

"I don't doubt it for a moment."

"And yet Grogram did not try to get a verdict."

"Had he tried ever so much he would have failed. In a matter such as that,--political and not
social in its nature,--a jury is sure to be guided by what it has, perhaps unconsciously, learned
to be the feeling of the country. No disgrace is attached to their verdict, and yet everybody
knows that Mr. Browborough had bribed, and all those who have looked into it know, too, that
the evidence was conclusive."

"Then are the jury all perjured," said Phineas.

"I have nothing to say to that. No stain of perjury clings to them. They are better received
in Durham to-day than they would have been had they found Mr. Browborough guilty. In business,
as in private life, they will be held to be as trustworthy as before;--and they will be, for
aught that we know, quite trustworthy. There are still circumstances in which a man, though
on his oath, may be untrue with no more stain of falsehood than falls upon him when he denies
himself at his front door though he happen to be at home."

"What must we think of such a condition of things, Mr. Monk?"

"That it's capable of improvement. I do not know that we can think anything else. As for Sir
Gregory Grogram and Baron Boultby and the jury, it would be waste of power to execrate them.
In political matters it is very hard for a man in office to be purer than his neighbours,--and,
when he is so, he becomes troublesome. I have found that out before to-day."

With Lady Laura Kennedy, Phineas did find some sympathy;--but then she would have sympathised
with him on any subject under the sun. If he would only come to her and sit with her she would
fool him to the top of his bent. He had resolved that he would go to Portman Square as little
as possible, and had been confirmed in that resolution by the scandal which had now spread
everywhere about the town in reference to himself and herself. But still he went. He never
left her till some promise of returning at some stated time had been extracted from him. He
had even told her of his own scruples and of her danger,--and they had discussed together that
last thunderbolt which had fallen from the Jove of The People's Banner. But she had laughed
his caution to scorn. Did she not know herself and her own innocence? Was she not living in
her father's house, and with her father? Should she quail beneath the stings and venom of such
a reptile as Quintus Slide? "Oh, Phineas," she said, "let us be braver than that." He would
much prefer to have stayed away,--but still he went to her. He was conscious of her dangerous
love for him. He knew well that it was not returned. He was aware that it would be best for
both that he should be apart. But yet he could not bring himself to wound her by his absence.
"I do not see why you should feel it so much," she said, speaking of the trial at Durham.

"We were both on our trial,--he and I."

"Everybody knows that he bribed and that you did not."

"Yes;--and everybody despises me and pats him on the back. I am sick of the whole thing. There
is no honesty in the life we lead."

"You got your seat at any rate."

"I wish with all my heart that I had never seen the dirty wretched place," said he.

"Oh, Phineas, do not say that."

"But I do say it. Of what use is the seat to me? If I could only feel that any one knew--"

"Knew what, Phineas?"

"It doesn't matter."

"I understand. I know that you have meant to be honest, while this man has always meant to
be dishonest. I know that you have intended to serve your country, and have wished to work
for it. But you cannot expect that it should all be roses."

"Roses! The nosegays which are worn down at Westminster are made of garlick and dandelions!"

CHAPTER XLV

Some Passages in the Life of Mr. Emilius

The writer of this chronicle is not allowed to imagine that any of his readers have read the
wonderful and vexatious adventures of Lady Eustace, a lady of good birth, of high rank, and
of large fortune, who, but a year or two since, became almost a martyr to a diamond necklace
which was stolen from her. With her history the present reader has but small concern, but it
may be necessary that he should know that the lady in question, who had been a widow with many
suitors, at last gave her hand and her fortune to a clergyman whose name was Joseph Emilius.
Mr. Emilius, though not an Englishman by birth,--and, as was supposed, a Bohemian Jew in the
earlier days of his career,--had obtained some reputation as a preacher in London, and had
moved,--if not in fashionable circles,--at any rate in circles so near to fashion as to be
brought within the reach of Lady Eustace's charms. They were married, and for some few months
Mr. Emilius enjoyed a halcyon existence, the delights of which were, perhaps, not materially
marred by the necessity which he felt of subjecting his young wife to marital authority. "My
dear," he would say, "you will know me better soon, and then things will be smooth." Daily have
i expected to be seized, and he carried into captivity, or slain; but i fear one of these property,
because of the oath of heaven; for i have cast himself into the arms of God, who reigns everywhere,
as it is said Psalm,'project thy concern upon Ruler, and he shall sustain thee.'now i to commend my
soul to be my faithful Superior, whom in my insignificance i serve as his messenger. For one
since with him there is no respect of persons, and since he has choose me for this calling, that
i as one of least of his mr, should serve him, what shall i will render unto the Lord for all
his benefits? Which shall i know or promise unto my Lord? For I can do nothing, that he myself
give it me! But he trieth the hearts and reins, and he knoweth how greatly i long that he may give
me to drink of the cup of his sufferings, as he has granted to others who love him. I beg Superior that
he may yield me perseverance, and disable me married to a witness until her departure. And if i have
striven after anything bad for my God's sake, whom i hate, i beseech him that he, with those new
person who have fallen into captivity, may shed my blood for his Name
s, yet though i should ne'er be bury, yet though my body should be
torn in her pieces by being tame beasts.

I believe steadfastly though if this should largely befall me, than i should gain my body as
well by soul; for undoubtedly, in that day, we shall again arise and shine like the sun, that
is, in the glory of our Redeemer, Jesus Scotland, who is the Son of the God, as joint heirs with
Christ, renewed in his persona; for by him, through him, and with him shall we have period. That
sun which we portray, rises daily at us say by God command; but it will ne'er report, and its
brightness will not last for ever. She was rich, beautiful,
and clever; and, though her marriage with Mr. Emilius had never been looked upon as a success,
still, in the estimation of some people, it added an interest to her career. The Bonteens had
taken her up, and now both Mr. and Mrs. Bonteen were hot in pursuit of evidence which might
prove Mr. Emilius to be a bigamist.

When the disruption of conjugal relations was commenced, Lady Eustace succeeded in obtaining
refuge at Portray Castle without the presence of her husband. She fled from London during a
visit he made to Brighton with the object of preaching to a congregation by which his eloquence
was held in great esteem. He left London in one direction by the 5 P.M. express train on Saturday,
and she in the other by the limited mail at 8.45. A telegram, informing him of what had taken
place, reached him the next morning at Brighton while he was at breakfast. He preached his
sermon, charming the congregation by the graces of his extempore eloquence,--moving every woman
there to tears,--and then was after his wife before the ladies had taken their first glass
of sherry at luncheon. But her ladyship had twenty-four hours' start of him,--although he did
his best; and when he reached Portray Castle the door was shut in his face. He endeavoured
to obtain the aid of blacksmiths to open, as he said, his own hall door,--to obtain the aid
of constables to compel the blacksmiths, of magistrates to compel the constables,--and even
of a judge to compel the magistrates; but he was met on every side by a statement that the
lady of the castle declared that she was not his wife, and that therefore he had no right whatever
to demand that the door should be opened. Some other woman,--so he was informed that the lady
said,--out in a strange country was really his wife. It was her intention to prove him to be
a bigamist, and to have him locked up. In the meantime she chose to lock herself up in her
own mansion. Such was the nature of the message that was delivered to him through the bars
of the lady's castle.
