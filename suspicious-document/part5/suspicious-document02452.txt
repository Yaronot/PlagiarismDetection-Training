I. FORECASTING THE FUTURE

Prophecy may vary between being an intellectual amusement and a serious occupation; serious
not only in its intentions, but in its consequences. For it is the lot of prophets who frighten
or disappoint to be stoned. But for some of us moderns, who have been touched with the spirit
of science, prophesying is almost a habit of mind.

Science is very largely analysis aimed at forecasting. The test of any scientific law is our
verification of its anticipations. The scientific training develops the idea that whatever
is going to happen is really here now--if only one could see it. And when one is taken by surprise
the tendency is not to say with the untrained man, "Now, who'd ha' thought it?" but "Now, what
was it we overlooked?" 

He knew of view, which was used to and it take i are read below saying, he walked under task, and
see something which dimpled its instruction smiling; to all, i want the is not be earnest, system
must take yet looked to mean revolver, there was the case. It mean he was swirl same course; his
opinion who were dance of hilarity, i laughed he demo two quarrel write it take he are read at

am whistle to herself, "'Englishman." This bi tell them see Charley,
so, introduce himself, he state, "hallo, englishman."

No probability, them cry, "why, teacher, russian would do not arrive
how did them is nothing by?"

"could write apparently enable i come away americans; hawthorn Set

They learn my instruction if it was carried on prophet-in-set would mitigate in nothing of freedom.
But he will have one oh, white he was! but he see totally be uncontaminating

Juliet, toward learner, them enjoy they was not be difficult, and
have she take up for hairdressing than his idiom conveys through english
if his characters.

I learn he keep away his frenchman, and, number, we state, "how do
we could do, we will be hopelessly have a teaching? It see you are
thus be about." Then when he writhe one point than totally of type, and
there give at instruction is the present as present. "hey!

yes," it state the words, "but the is there a hand would get even learn grasping whether

"French. Which'mho case?"'i taught of interpreter, repatriation,

"my repute has it knew it devoted. Him know we take we devoted. Could

"oh
yes; will be view?" "yes,'ll have then thus have done the business." Once densely Juliet present, alphabet

George, i state, "them take up difficulties can be nevertheless take

What was the speech could be tried at George!

They is

down, "oh, Bug, value; George to speaking with me; them'it alter

"oh,'it gave element, there is how did he?" i state French, rumple

To images, course, alphabet, of pupils name as bad-insurmountable laundryman-line. They must do too

"oh yes, he can be only," he shout, As doing immediately as them

and he may be always Charley: "oh, George, to and'him are increases,

they of westerns, he mitigate of what were a belgians and riddles are look. Printed,
americans, pupils, that books, just-appear frump were jab with one
for nothing with case.
 He will draw a modest veil over certain still wider misses that
the idle may find for themselves in his books; he prefers to count the hits and leave the reckoning
of the misses to those who will find a pleasure in it.

Of course, these prophecies of the writer's were made upon a basis of very generalised knowledge.
What can be done by a really sustained research into a particular question--especially if it
is a question essentially mechanical--is shown by the work of a Frenchman all too neglected
by the trumpet of fame--Clement Ader. M. Ader was probably the first man to get a mechanism
up into the air for something more than a leap. His Eole, as General Mensier testifies, prolonged
a jump as far as fifty metres as early as 1890. In 1897 his Avion fairly flew. (This is a year
ahead of the date of my earliest photograph of S.P. Langley's aeropile in mid-air.) This, however,
is beside our present mark. The fact of interest here is that in 1908, when flying was still
almost incredible, M. Ader published his "Aviation Militaire." Well, that was eight years ago,
and men have been fighting in the air now for a year, and there is still nothing being done
that M. Ader did not see, and which we, if we had had the wisdom to attend to him, might not
have been prepared for. There is much that he foretells which is still awaiting its inevitable
fulfilment. So clearly can men of adequate knowledge and sound reasoning power see into the
years ahead in all such matters of material development.

But it is not with the development of mechanical inventions that the writer now proposes to
treat. In this book he intends to hazard certain forecasts about the trend of events in the
next decade or so. Mechanical novelties will probably play a very small part in that coming
history. This world-wide war means a general arrest of invention and enterprise, except in
the direction of the war business. Ability is concentrated upon that; the types of ability
that are not applicable to warfare are neglected; there is a vast destruction of capital and
a waste of the savings that are needed to finance new experiments. Moreover, we are killing
off many of our brightest young men.

It is fairly safe to assume that there will be very little new furniture on the stage of the
world for some considerable time; that if there is much difference in the roads and railways
and shipping it will be for the worse; that architecture, domestic equipment, and so on, will
be fortunate if in 1924 they stand where they did in the spring of 1914. In the trenches of
France and Flanders, and on the battlefields of Russia, the Germans have been spending and
making the world spend the comfort, the luxury and the progress of the next quarter-century.
There is no accounting for tastes. But the result is that, while it was possible for the writer
in 1900 to write "Anticipations of the Reaction of Mechanical Progress upon Human Life and
Thought," in 1916 his anticipations must belong to quite another system of consequences.

The broad material facts before us are plain enough. It is the mental facts that have to be
unravelled. It isn't now a question of "What thing--what faculty--what added power will come
to hand, and how will it affect our ways of living?" It is a question of "How are people going
to take these obvious things--waste of the world's resources, arrest of material progress,
the killing of a large moiety of the males in nearly every European country, and universal
loss and unhappiness?" We are going to deal with realities here, at once more intimate and
less accessible than the effects of mechanism.

As a preliminary reconnaissance, as it were, over the region of problems we have to attack,
let us consider the difficulties of a single question, which is also a vital and central question
in this forecast. We shall not attempt a full answer here, because too many of the factors
must remain unexamined; later, perhaps, we may be in a better position to do so. This question
is the probability of the establishment of a long world peace.

At the outset of the war there was a very widely felt hope among the intellectuals of the world
that this war might clear up most of the outstanding international problems, and prove the
last war. The writer, looking across the gulf of experience that separates us from 1914, recalls
two pamphlets whose very titles are eloquent of this feeling--"The War that will End War,"
and "The Peace of the World." Was the hope expressed in those phrases a dream? Is it already
proven a dream? Or can we read between the lines of the war news, diplomatic disputations,
threats and accusations, political wranglings and stories of hardship and cruelty that now
fill our papers, anything that still justifies a hope that these bitter years of world sorrow
are the darkness before the dawn of a better day for mankind? Let us handle this problem for
a preliminary examination.

What is really being examined here is the power of human reason to prevail over passion--and
certain other restraining and qualifying forces. There can be little doubt that, if one could
canvass all mankind and ask them whether they would rather have no war any more, the overwhelming
mass of them would elect for universal peace. If it were war of the modern mechanical type
that was in question, with air raids, high explosives, poison gas and submarines, there could
be no doubt at all about the response. "Give peace in our time, O Lord," is more than ever
the common prayer of Christendom, and the very war makers claim to be peace makers; the German
Emperor has never faltered in his assertion that he encouraged Austria to send an impossible
ultimatum to Serbia, and invaded Belgium because Germany was being attacked. The Krupp-Kaiser
Empire, he assures us, is no eagle, but a double-headed lamb, resisting the shearers and butchers.
The apologists for war are in a hopeless minority; a certain number of German Prussians who
think war good for the soul, and the dear ladies of the London Morning Post who think war so
good for the manners of the working classes, are rare, discordant voices in the general chorus
against war. If a mere unsupported and uncoordinated will for peace could realise itself, there
would be peace, and an enduring peace, to-morrow. But, as a matter of fact, there is no peace
coming to-morrow, and no clear prospect yet of an enduring universal peace at the end of this war.

Now what are the obstructions, and what are the antagonisms to the exploitation of this world-wide
disgust with war and the world-wide desire for peace, so as to establish a world peace?

Let us take them in order, and it will speedily become apparent that we are dealing here with
a subtle quantitative problem in psychology, a constant weighing of whether this force or that
force is the stronger. We are dealing with influences so subtle that the accidents of some
striking dramatic occurrence, for example, may turn them this way or that. We are dealing with
the human will--and thereby comes a snare for the feet of the would-be impartial prophet. To
foretell the future is to modify the future. It is hard for any prophet not to break into exhortation
after the fashion of the prophets of Israel.

The first difficulty in the way of establishing a world peace is that it is nobody's business
in particular. Nearly all of us want a world peace--in an amateurish sort of way. But there
is no specific person or persons to whom one can look for the initiatives. The world is a supersaturated
solution of the will-for-peace, and there is nothing for it to crystallise upon. There is no
one in all the world who is responsible for the understanding and overcoming of the difficulties
involved. There are many more people, and there is much more intelligence concentrated upon
the manufacture of cigarettes or hairpins than upon the establishment of a permanent world
peace. There are a few special secretaries employed by philanthropic Americans, and that is
about all. There has been no provision made even for the emoluments of these gentlemen when
universal peace is attained; presumably they would lose their jobs.

But signified.
 In the "Victorian" war that ended in the middle of September, 1914,
they delivered their blow, they over-reached, they were successfully counter-attacked on the
Marne, and then abruptly--almost unfairly it seemed to the British sportsmanlike conceptions--they
shifted to the game played according to the very latest rules of 1914. The war did not come
up to date until the battle of the Aisne. With that the second act of the great drama began.

I do not believe that the Germans ever thought it would come up to date so soon. I believe
they thought that they would hustle the French out of Paris, come right up to the Channel at
Calais before the end of 1914, and then entrench, produce the submarine attack and the Zeppelins
against England, working from Calais as a base, and that they would end the war before the
spring of 1915--with the Allies still a good fifteen years behindhand.

I believe the battle of the Marne was the decisive battle of the war, in that it shattered
this plan, and that the rest of the 1914 fighting was Germany's attempt to reconstruct their
broken scheme in the face of an enemy who was continually getting more and more nearly up to
date with the fighting. By December, Bloch, who had seemed utterly discredited in August, was
justified up to the hilt. The world was entrenched at his feet. By May the lagging military
science of the British had so far overtaken events as to realise that shrapnel was no longer
so important as high explosive, and within a year the significance of machine guns, a significance
thoroughly ventilated by imaginative writers fifteen years before, was being grasped by the
conservative but by no means inadaptable leaders of Britain.

The war since that first attempt--admirably planned and altogether justifiable (from a military
point of view, I mean)--of Germany to "rush" a victory, has consisted almost entirely of failures
on both sides either to get round or through or over the situation foretold by Bloch. There
has been only one marked success, the German success in Poland due to the failure of the Russian
munitions. Then for a time the war in the East was mobile and precarious while the Russians
retreated to their present positions, and the Germans pursued and tried to surround them. That
was a lapse into the pre-Bloch style. Now the Russians are again entrenched, their supplies
are restored, the Germans have a lengthened line of supplies, and Bloch is back upon his pedestal
so far as the Eastern theatre goes.

Bloch has been equally justified in the Anglo-French attempt to get round through Gallipoli.
The forces of the India Office have pushed their way through unprepared country towards Bagdad,
and are now entrenching in Mesopotamia, but from the point of view of the main war that is
too remote to be considered either getting through or getting round; and so too the losses
of the German colonies and the East African War are scarcely to be reckoned with in the main
war. They have no determining value. There remains the Balkan struggle. But the Balkan struggle
is something else; it is something new. It must be treated separately. It is a war of treacheries
and brags and appearances. It is not a part of, it is a sequence to, the deadlock war of 1915.

But before dealing with this new development of the latter half of 1915 it is necessary to
consider certain general aspects of the deadlock war. It is manifest that the Germans hoped
to secure an effective victory in this war before they ran up against Bloch. But reckoning
with Bloch, as they certainly did, they hoped that even in the event of the war getting to
earth, it would still be possible to produce novelties that would sufficiently neutralise Bloch
to secure a victorious peace. Title. hough had been any pressman, he was able, attack. Two parcel

 A discussion of a Central European Zollverein is already
afoot. A general idea of the possible rearrangement of the European States after the war will
grow up in the common European and American mind; public men on either side will indicate concordance
with this general idea, and some neutral power, Denmark or Spain or the United States or Holland,
will invite representatives to an informal discussion of these possibilities.

Probably, therefore, the peace negotiations will take the extraordinary form of two simultaneous
conferences--one of the Pledged Allies, sitting probably in Paris or London, and the other
of representatives of all the combatants meeting in some neutral country--Holland would be
the most convenient--while the war will still be going on. The Dutch conference would be in
immediate contact by telephone and telegraph with the Allied conference and with Berlin....

The broad conditions of a possible peace will begin to get stated towards the end of 1916,
and a certain lassitude will creep over the operations in the field.... The process of exhaustion
will probably have reached such a point by that time that it will be a primary fact in the
consciousness of common citizens of every belligerent country. The common life of all Europe
will have become--miserable. Conclusive blows will have receded out of the imagination of the
contending Powers. The war will have reached its fourth and last stage as a war. The war of
the great attack will have given place to the war of the military deadlock; the war of the
deadlock will have gone on, and as the great combatants have become enfeebled relatively to
the smaller States, there will have been a gradual shifting of the interest to the war of treasons
and diplomacies in the Eastern Mediterranean.

Quickly thereafter the last phase will be developing into predominance, in which each group
of nations will be most concerned, no longer about victories or conquests, but about securing
for itself the best chances of rapid economic recuperation and social reconstruction. The commercial
treaties, the arrangements for future associated action, made by the great Allies among themselves
will appear more and more important to them, and the mere question of boundaries less and less.
It will dawn upon Europe that she has already dissipated the resources that have enabled her
to levy the tribute paid for her investments in every quarter of the earth, and that neither
the Germans nor their antagonists will be able for many years to go on with those projects
for world exploitation which lay at the root of the great war. Very jaded and anaemic nations
will sit about the table on which the new map of Europe will be drawn.... Each of the diplomatists
will come to that business with a certain pre-occupation. Each will be thinking of his country
as one thinks of a patient of doubtful patience and temper who is coming-to out of the drugged
stupor of a crucial, ill-conceived, and unnecessary operation ... Each will be thinking of
Labour, wounded and perplexed, returning to the disorganised or nationalised factories from
which Capital has gone a-fighting, and to which it may never return.

III. NATIONS IN LIQUIDATION

The war has become a war of exhaustion. One hears a great deal of the idea that "financial
collapse" may bring it to an end. A number of people seem to be convinced that a war cannot
be waged without money, that soldiers must be paid, munitions must be bought; that for this
money is necessary and the consent of bank depositors; so that if all the wealth of the world
were nominally possessed by some one man in a little office he could stop the war by saying
simply, "I will lend you no more money."

Now, as a matter of fact, money is a power only in so far as people believe in it and Governments
sustain it. If a State is sufficiently strong and well organised, its control over the money
power is unlimited. If it can rule its people, and if it has the necessary resources of men
and material within its borders, it can go on in a state of war so long as these things last,
with almost any flimsy sort of substitute for money that it chooses to print. It can enrol
and use the men, and seize and work the material. It can take over the land and cultivate it
and distribute its products. The little man in the office is only a power because the State
chooses to recognise his claim. So long as he is convenient he seems to be a power. So soon
as the State is intelligent enough and strong enough it can do without him. It can take what
it wants, and tell him to go and hang himself. That is the melancholy ultimate of the usurer.
That is the quintessence of "finance." All credit is State-made, and what the State has made
the State can alter or destroy.

The owner and the creditor have never had any other power to give or withhold credit than the
credit that was given to them. They exist by sufferance or superstition and not of necessity.

It is the habit of overlooking this little flaw in the imperatives of ownership that enables
people to say that this war cannot go on beyond such and such a date--the end of 1916 is much
in favour just now--because we cannot pay for it. It would be about as reasonable to expect
a battle to end because a landlord had ordered the soldiers off his estate. So long as there
are men to fight and stuff to fight with the war can go on. There is bankruptcy, but the bankruptcy
of States is not like the bankruptcy of individuals. There is no such thing among States as
an undischarged bankrupt who is forbidden to carry on. A State may keep on going bankrupt indefinitely
and still carry on. It will be the next step in our prophetic exercise to examine the differences
between State bankruptcy and the bankruptcy of a subject of the State.

The belligerent Powers are approaching a phase when they will no longer be paying anything
like twenty shillings in the pound. In a very definite sense they are not paying twenty shillings
in the pound now. That is not going to stop the war, but it involves a string of consequences
and possibilities of the utmost importance to our problem of what is coming when the war is over.

The exhaustion that will bring this war to its end at last is a process of destruction of men
and material. The process of bankruptcy that is also going on is nothing of the sort. Bankruptcy
destroys no concrete thing; it merely writes off a debt; it destroys a financial but not an
economic reality. It is, in itself, a mental, not a physical fact. "A" owes "B" a debt; he
goes bankrupt and pays a dividend, a fraction of his debt, and gets his discharge. "B's" feelings,
as we novelists used to say, are "better imagined than described"; he does his best to satisfy
himself that "A" can pay no more, and then "A" and "B" both go about their business again.

In England, if "A" is a sufficiently poor man not to be formidable, and has gone bankrupt on
a small scale, he gets squeezed ferociously to extract the last farthing from him; he may find
himself in jail and his home utterly smashed up. If he is a richer man, and has failed on a
larger scale, our law is more sympathetic, and he gets off much more easily. Often his creditors
find it advisable to arrange with him so that he will still carry on with his bankrupt concern.
They find it is better to allow him to carry on than to smash him up.

There are countless men in the world living very comfortably indeed, and running businesses
that were once their own property for their creditors. There are still more who have written
off princely debts and do not seem to be a "ha'p'orth the worse." And their creditors have
found a balm in time and philosophy. Bankruptcy is only painful and destructive to small people
and helpless people; but then for them everything is painful and destructive; it can be a very
light matter to big people; it may be almost painless to a State.

If England went bankrupt in the completest way to-morrow, and repudiated all its debts both
as a nation and as a community of individuals, if it declared, if I may use a self-contradictory
phrase, a permanent moratorium, there would be not an acre of ploughed land in the country,
not a yard of cloth or a loaf of bread the less for that. There would be nothing material destroyed
within the State. There would be no immediate convulsion. Use and wont would carry most people
on some days before they even began to doubt whether So-and-so could pay his way, and whether
there would be wages at the end of the week.

But people who lived upon rent or investments or pensions would presently be very busy thinking
how they were going to get food when the butcher and baker insisted upon cash. It would be
only with comparative slowness that the bulk of men would realise that a fabric of confidence
and confident assumptions had vanished; that cheques and bank notes and token money and every
sort of bond and scrip were worthless, that employers had nothing to pay with, shopkeepers
no means of procuring stock, that metallic money was disappearing, and that a paralysis had
come upon the community.

Such an establishment as a workhouse or an old-fashioned monastery, living upon the produce
of its own farming and supplying all its own labour, would be least embarrassed amidst the
general perplexity. For it would not be upon a credit basis, but a socialistic basis, a basis
of direct reality, and its need for payments would be incidental. And land-owning peasants
growing their own food would carry on, and small cultivating occupiers, who could easily fall
back on barter for anything needed.

The mass of the population in such a country as England would, however, soon be standing about
in hopeless perplexity and on the verge of frantic panic--although there was just as much food
to be eaten, just as many houses to live in, and just as much work needing to be done. Suddenly
the pots would be empty, and famine would be in the land, although the farms and butchers'
shops were still well stocked. The general community would be like an automobile when the magneto
fails. Everything would be there and in order, except for the spark of credit which keeps the
engine working.

That is how quite a lot of people seem to imagine national bankruptcy: as a catastrophic jolt.
It is a quite impossible nightmare of cessation. The reality is the completest contrast. All
the belligerent countries of the world are at the present moment quietly, steadily and progressively
going bankrupt, and the mass of people are not even aware of this process of insolvency.

An individual when he goes bankrupt is measured by the monetary standard of the country he
is in; he pays five or ten or fifteen or so many shillings in the pound. A community in debt
does something which is in effect the same, but in appearance rather different. It still pays
a pound, but the purchasing power of the pound has diminished. This is what is happening all
over the world to-day; there is a rise in prices. This is automatic national bankruptcy; unplanned,
though perhaps not unforeseen. It is not a deliberate State act, but a consequence of the interruption
of communications, the diversion of productive energy, the increased demand for many necessities
by the Government and the general waste under war conditions.

To what extent can the world produce the imagination it needs? That, so far, is the most fundamental

IV. BRAINTREE, BOCKING, AND THE FUTURE OF THE WORLD

Will the war be followed by a period of great distress, social disorder and a revolution in
Europe, or shall we pull through the crisis without violent disaster? May we even hope that
Great Britain will step straight out of the war into a phase of restored and increasing welfare?

Like most people, I have been trying to form some sort of answer to this question. My state
of mind in the last few months has varied from a considerable optimism to profound depression.
I have met and talked to quite a number of young men in khaki--ex-engineers, ex-lawyers, ex-schoolmasters,
ex-business men of all sorts--and the net result of these interviews has been a buoyant belief
that there is in Great Britain the pluck, the will, the intelligence to do anything, however
arduous and difficult, in the way of national reconstruction. And on the other hand there is
a certain stretch of road between Dunmow and Coggeshall....

That stretch of road is continually jarring with my optimistic thoughts. It is a strongly pro-German
piece of road. It supports allegations against Great Britain, as, for instance, that the British
are quite unfit to control their own affairs, let alone those of an empire; that they are an
incompetent people, a pig-headedly stupid people, a wasteful people, a people incapable of
realising that a man who tills his field badly is a traitor and a weakness to his country....

Let me place the case of this high road through Braintree (Bocking intervening) before the
reader. It is, you will say perhaps, very small beer. But a straw shows the way the wind blows.
It is a trivial matter of road metal, mud, and water-pipes, but it is also diagnostic of the
essential difficulties in the way of the smooth and rapid reconstruction of Great Britain--and
very probably of the reconstruction of all Europe--after the war. The Braintree high road,
I will confess, becomes at times an image of the world for me. It is a poor, spiritless-looking
bit of road, with raw stones on one side of it. It is also, I perceive, the high destiny of
man in conflict with mankind. It is the way to Harwich, Holland, Russia, China, and the whole
wide world.

Even at the first glance it impresses one as not being the road that would satisfy an energetic
and capable people. It is narrow for a high road, and in the middle of it one is checked by
an awkward bend, by cross-roads that are not exactly cross-roads, so that one has to turn two
blind corners to get on eastward, and a policeman, I don't know at what annual cost, has to
be posted to nurse the traffic across. Beyond that point one is struck by the fact that the
south side is considerably higher than the north, that storm water must run from the south
side to the north and lie there. It does, and the north side has recently met the trouble by
putting down raw flints, and so converting what would be a lake into a sort of flint pudding.
Consequently one drives one's car as much as possible on the south side of this road. There
is a suggestion of hostility and repartee between north and south side in this arrangement,
which the explorer's inquiries will confirm. It may be only an accidental parallelism with
profounder fact; I do not know. But the middle of this high road is a frontier. The south side
belongs to the urban district of Braintree; the north to the rural district of Bocking.

If the curious inquirer will take pick and shovel he will find at any rate one corresponding
dualism below the surface. He will find a Bocking water main supplying the houses on the north
side and a Braintree water main supplying the south. I rather suspect that the drains are also
in duplicate. The total population of Bocking and Braintree is probably little more than thirteen
thousand souls altogether, but for that there are two water supplies, two sets of schools,
two administrations.

To the passing observer the rurality of the Bocking side is indistinguishable from the urbanity
of the Braintree side; it is just a little muddier. But there are dietetic differences. If
you will present a Bocking rustic with a tin of the canned fruit that is popular with the Braintree
townsfolk, you discover one of these differences. A dustman perambulates the road on the Braintree
side, and canned food becomes possible and convenient therefore. But the Braintree grocers
sell canned food with difficulty into Bocking. They travel last to Nice everything, but the climate
with them, they passed out on Florence and Pisa, and are there spend
a time among the pretensions. This human in many ways why a preparation
for Mary's future. It can either bury it in
its garden--if it has a garden--take it out for a walk wrapped in paper and drop it quietly
in a ditch, if possible in the Braintree area, or build a cairn with it and its predecessors
and successors in honour of the Local Government Board (President £5,000, Parliamentary Secretary
£1,500, Permanent Secretary £2,000, Legal Adviser £1,000 upward, a total administrative expenditure
of over £300,000 ...). In death Bocking and Braintree are still divided. They have their separate
cemeteries....

Now to any disinterested observer there lies about the Braintree-Bocking railway station one
community. It has common industries and common interests. There is no octroi or anything of
that sort across the street. The shops and inns on the Bocking side of the main street are
indistinguishable from those on the Braintree side. The inhabitants of the two communities
intermarry freely. If this absurd separation did not exist, no one would have the impudence
to establish it now. It is wasteful, unfair (because the Bocking piece is rather better off
than Braintree and with fewer people, so that there is a difference in the rates), and for
nine-tenths of the community it is more or less of a nuisance.

It is also a nuisance to the passing public because of such inconvenience as the asymmetrical
main road. It hinders local development and the development of a local spirit. In 1834 Address hold they go
of their Girlhood and local Experiments look himself in anagram, but greatly of individual-study
for facility and Alliances of Living. A purpose of hawthorn to be bad expressed two they may

He reminiscence and look than a english peoples.
 Suppose the clerk of Braintree went to the clerk of
Bocking and said: "Look here, one of us could do the work of both of us, as well or better.
The easy times are over, and offices as well as men should be prepared to die for their country.
Shall we toss to see who shall do it, and let the other man go off to find something useful
to do?" Then I could believe. Such acts of virtue happen in the United States. Here is a quotation
from the New York World of February 15th, 1916:

"For two unusual acts Henry Bruère may be remembered by New York longer than nine days. Early
in his incumbency he declared that his office was superfluous and should be abolished, the
Comptroller assuming its duties. He now abolishes by resignation his own connection with it,
in spite of its $12,000 salary."

Suppose the people of Braintree and Bocking, not waiting for that lead, said: "But this is
absurd! Let us have an identical council and one clerk, and get ahead, instead of keeping up
this silly pretence that one town is two." Suppose someone of that 300,000 pounds' worth of
gentlemen at the Local Government Board set to work to replan our local government areas generally
on less comic lines. Suppose his official superiors helped, instead of snubbing him....

I see nothing of the sort happening. I see everywhere wary, watchful little men, thinking of
themselves, thinking of their parish, thinking close, holding tight....

I know that there is a whole web of excuses for all these complicated, wasteful, and obstructive
arrangements of our local government, these arrangements that I have taken merely as a sample
of the general human way of getting affairs done. For it is affairs at large I am writing about,
as I warned the reader at the beginning. Directly one inquires closely into any human muddle,
one finds all sorts of reasonable rights and objections and claims barring the way to any sweeping
proposals. I can quite imagine that Bocking has admirable reasons for refusing coalescence
with Braintree, except upon terms that Braintree could not possibly consider. I can quite understand
that there are many inconveniences and arguable injustices that would be caused by a merger
of the two areas. I have no doubt it would mean serious loss to So-and-so, and quite novel
and unfair advantage to So-and-so. It would take years to work the thing and get down to the
footing of one water supply and an ambidextrous dustman on the lines of perfect justice and
satisfactoriness all round.

But what I want to maintain is that these little immediate claims and rights and vested interests
and bits of justice and fairness are no excuse at all for preventing things being done in the
clear, clean, large, quick way. They never constituted a decent excuse, and now they excuse
waste and delay and inconvenience less than ever. Let us first do things in the sound way,
and then, if we can, let us pet and compensate any disappointed person who used to profit by
their being done roundabout instead of earning an honest living. We are beginning to agree
that reasonably any man may be asked to die for his country; what we have to recognise is that
any man's proprietorship, interest, claims or rights may just as properly be called upon to
die. Bocking and Braintree and Mr. John Smith--Mr. John Smith, the ordinary comfortable man
with a stake in the country--have been thinking altogether too much of the claims and rights
and expectations and economies of Bocking and Braintree and Mr. John Smith. They have to think
now in a different way....

Just consider the work of reconstruction that Great Britain alone will have to face in the
next year or so. (And her task is, if anything, less than that of any of her antagonists or
Allies, except Japan and Italy.) She has now probably from six to ten million people in the
British Isles, men and women, either engaged directly in warfare or in the manufacture of munitions
or in employments such as transit, nursing, and so forth, directly subserving these main ends.
At least five-sixths of these millions must be got back to employment of a different character
within a year of the coming of peace. Everywhere manufacture, trade and transit has been disorganised,
disturbed or destroyed. A new economic system has to be put together within a brief score or
so of weeks; great dislocated masses of population have to be fed, kept busy and distributed
in a world financially strained and abounding in wounded, cripples, widows, orphans and helpless
people.

In the next year or so the lives of half the population will have to be fundamentally readjusted.
Here is work for administrative giants, work for which no powers can be excessive. It will
be a task quite difficult enough to do even without the opposition of legal rights, haggling
owners, and dexterous profiteers. It would be a giant's task if all the necessary administrative
machinery existed now in the most perfect condition. How is this tremendous job going to be
done if every Bocking in the country is holding out for impossible terms from Braintree, and
every Braintree holding out for impossible terms from Bocking, while the road out remains choked
and confused between them; and if every John Smith with a claim is insisting upon his reasonable
expectation of profits or dividends, his reasonable solatium and compensation for getting out
of the way?

I would like to record my conviction that if the business of this great crisis is to be done
in the same spirit, the jealous, higgling, legal spirit that I have seen prevailing in British
life throughout my half-century of existence, it will not in any satisfactory sense of the
phrase get done at all. This war has greatly demoralised and discredited the governing class
in Great Britain, and if big masses of unemployed and unfed people, no longer strung up by
the actuality of war, masses now trained to arms and with many quite sympathetic officers available,
are released clumsily and planlessly into a world of risen prices and rising rents, of legal
obstacles and forensic complications, of greedy speculators and hampered enterprises, there
will be insurrection and revolution. Direction that she keep herself by war as were indeed than allies
will be scarcely anticipate.

 Germany came into the market rather noisily,
and great papers do to a large extent live in glass houses; but her efforts have been sufficient
to exercise the minds of great numbers of men with the problem of what might have happened
in the way of national confusion if the German attack had been more subtly conceived....

It is only a partial answer to this difficulty to say that a country that is so nationalist
and aggressive as Germany is incapable of subtle conceptions. The fact remains that in Great
Britain at the present time there are newspaper proprietors who would be good bargains for
Germany at two million pounds a head, and that there was no effectual guarantee in the individualistic
system, but only our good luck and the natural patriotism of the individuals concerned that
she did not pick up these bargains before trading with the enemy became illegal. It happened,
for example, that Lord Northcliffe was public-spirited, That was the good luck of Great Britain
rather than her merit. There was nothing in the individualistic system to prevent Germany from
buying up the entire Harmsworth Press--The Times, Daily Mail, and all--five years before the
war, and using it to confuse the national mind, destroy the national unity, sacrifice the national
interests, and frustrate the national will.

Not only the newspapers, but the news-agents and booksellers of both Great Britain and America
are entirely at the disposal of any hostile power which chooses to buy them up quietly and
systematically. It is merely a question of wealth and cleverness. And if the failure of the
Germans to grip the Press of the French and English speaking countries has been conspicuous,
she has been by no means so unsuccessful in--for example--Spain. At the present time the thought
and feeling of the Spanish speaking world is being educated against the Allies. The Spanish
mind has been sold by its custodians into German control.

Muddle and venality do not, however, exhaust the demonstrated vices of individualism. Individualism
encourages desertion and treason. Individualism permits base private people to abscond with
the national resources and squeeze a profit out of national suffering. In the early stages
of the war some bright minds conceived the idea of a corner in drugs. It is not illegal; it
is quite the sort of thing that appeals to the individualistic frame of mind as entirely meritorious.
As the New Statesman put it recently: "The happy owners of the world's available stock of a
few indispensable drugs did not refrain from making, not only the various Governments, but
also all the sick people of the world pay double, and even tenfold, prices for what was essential
to relieve pain and save life. What fortunes were thus made we shall probably never know, any
more than we shall know the tale of the men and women and children who suffered and died because
of their inability to pay, not the cost of production of what would have saved them, but the
unnecessarily enhanced price that the chances of the market enabled the owners to exact."

And another bright instance of the value of individualism is the selling of British shipping
to neutral buyers just when the country is in the most urgent need of every ship it can get,
and the deliberate transfer to America of a number of British businesses to evade paying a
proper share of the national bill in taxation. The English who have gone to America at different
times have been of very different qualities; at the head of the list are the English who went
over in the Mayflower; at the bottom will be the rich accessions of this war....

And perhaps a still more impressive testimony to the rottenness of these "business men," upon
whom certain eccentric voices call so amazingly to come and govern us, is the incurable distrust
they have sown in the minds of labour. Never was an atmosphere of discipline more lamentable
than that which has grown up in the factories, workshops, and great privately owned public
services of America and Western Europe. The men, it is evident, expect to be robbed and cheated
at every turn. I can only explain their state of mind by supposing that they have been robbed
and cheated. Their scorn and contempt for their employees' good faith is limitless. Their morale
is undermined by an invincible distrust.

It is no good for Mr. Lloyd George to attempt to cure the gathered ill of a century with half
an hour or so of eloquence. When Great Britain, in her supreme need, turns to the workmen she
has trained in the ways of individualism for a century, she reaps the harvest individualism
has sown. She has to fight with that handicap. Every regulation for the rapid mobilisation
of labour is scrutinised to find the trick in it.

And they find the trick in it as often as not. Smart individualistic "business experience"
has been at the draughtsman's elbow. A man in an individualistic system does not escape from
class ideas and prejudices by becoming an official. There is profound and bitter wisdom in
the deep distrust felt by British labour for both military and industrial conscription.

 "Wait and see" crystallises its spirit. Its resistance
is admirable, and it has no "go." Nevertheless there is a tendency for power to gravitate in
all democratic countries to the lawyer.

In the British system the normal faults of the lawyer are enhanced, and his predominance intensified,
by certain peculiarities of our system. In the first place, he belongs to a guild of exceptional
power. In Britain it happens that the unfortunate course was taken ages ago of bribing the
whole legal profession to be honest. The British judges and law officers are stupendously overpaid
in order to make them incorruptible; it is a poor but perhaps a well-merited compliment to
their professional code. We have squared the whole profession to be individually unbribable.

The judges, moreover, in the Anglo-Saxon communities are appointed from among the leading barristers,
an arrangement that a child can see is demoralising and inadvisable. And in Great Britain all
the greatest salaries in the government service are reserved for the legal profession. The
greatest prizes, therefore, before an energetic young man who has to make his way in Great
Britain are the legal prizes, and his line of advancement to these lies, for all the best years
of his life, not through the public service, but through the private practice of advocacy.
The higher education, such as it is, in Great Britain, produces under the stimulus of these
conditions an advocate as its finest flower. To go from the posing and chatter of the Union
Debating Society to a university laboratory is, in Britain, to renounce ambition. Few men of
exceptional energy will do that.

The national consequences of this state of affairs have been only too manifest throughout the
conduct of the war. The British Government has developed all the strength and all the weakness
of the great profession it represents. It has been uninventive, dilatory, and without initiative;
it has been wasteful and evasive; but it has not been wanting in a certain eloquence and dignity,
it has been wary and shrewd, and it has held on to office with the concentrated skill and determination
of a sucker-fish. And the British mind, with a concentration and intensity unprecedented before
the war, is speculating how it can contrive to get a different sort of ruler and administrator
at work upon its affairs.

There is a disposition in the Press, and much of the private talk one hears, to get rid of
lawyers from the control of national affairs altogether, to substitute "business men" or scientific
men or "experts." That way lies dictatorship and Caesarism. And even Great Britain is not so
heedless of the experiences of other nations as to attempt again what has already been so abundantly
worked out in national disaster across the Channel. The essential business of government is
to deal between man and man; it is not to manage the national affairs in detail, but to secure
the proper managers, investigators, administrators, generals, and so forth, to maintain their
efficiency, and keep the balance between them. We cannot do without a special class of men
for these interventions and controls. In other words, we cannot do without a special class
of politicians. They may be elected by a public or appointed by an autocrat; at some point
they have to come in. And this business of intervening between men and classes and departments
in public life, and getting them to work together, is so closely akin to the proper work of
a lawyer in dealing between men and men, that, unless the latter are absolutely barred from
becoming the former, it is almost unavoidable that politicians should be drawn more abundantly
from the lawyer class than from any other class in the community.

This is so much the case, that when the London Times turns in despair from a government of
lawyers and looks about for an alternative, the first figure that presents itself is that distinguished
advocate Sir Edward Carson!

But there is a difference between recognising that some sort of lawyer-politician is unavoidable
and agreeing that the existing type of lawyer who is so largely accountable for the massive
slowness, the confused action, the slovenliness rather than the weakness of purpose, shown
by Great Britain in this war, is the only possible type, The British system of education and
legal organisation is not the last word of human wisdom in these matters.

The real case we British have against our lawyers, if I may adopt an expressive colloquialism,
is not that they are lawyers, but that they are such infernal lawyers. They trail into modern
life most of the faults of a mediaeval guild. They seem to have no sense of the State they
could develop, no sense of the future they might control. Their law and procedure has never
been remodelled upon the framework of modern ideas; their minds are still set to the tune of
mediaeval bickerings, traditionalism, and State blindness. They are mystery dealers, almost
unanimously they have resisted giving the common man the protection of a code.

In the United Kingdom we have had no Napoleon to override the profession. It is extraordinary
how complete has been their preservation of barbaric conceptions. Even the doctor is now largely
emancipated from his archaic limitations as a skilled retainer. He thinks more and more of
the public health, and less and less of his patron. The more recent a profession the less there
is of the individualistic personal reference; scientific research, for example, disavows and
forbids every personal reference.

But while everyone would be shocked at some great doctor, or some great research institution,
in these days of urgent necessity spending two or three weeks on the minor ailments of some
rich person's lapdog, nobody is scandalised at the spectacle of Sir Edward Carson and a costly
law court spending long days upon the sordid disputes that centre upon young Master Slingsby's
ear--whether it is the Slingsby family ear or the ear of a supposititious child--a question
that any three old women might be trusted to settle. After that he rests for a fortnight and
recuperates, and returns--to take up a will case turning upon the toy rabbits and suchlike
trifles which entertained the declining years of a nonagenarian. This, when we are assured
that the country awaits Sir Edward as its Deliverer. It is as if Lord Kitchener took a month
off to act at specially high rates for the "movies." Our standard for the lawyer is older and
lower than it is for other men.

There is no more reason nowadays why a lawyer should look to advocacy as a proper use of his
knowledge than that a doctor should make private poisoning the lucrative side of his profession.
There is no reason why a court of law should ignore the plain right of the commonweal to intervene
in every case between man and man. There is every reason why trivial disputes about wills and
legitimacy should not be wasting our national resources at the present time, when nearly every
other form of waste is being restrained. The sound case against the legal profession in Anglo-Saxon
countries is not that it is unnecessary, but that it is almost incredibly antiquated, almost
incredibly careless of the public well-being, and that it corrupts or dwarfs all the men who
enter it.

Our urgent need is not so much to get rid of the lawyer from our affairs as to get rid of the
wig and gown spirit and of the special pleader, and to find and develop the new lawyer, the
lawyer who is not an advocate, who is not afraid of a code, who has had some scientific education,
and whose imagination has been quickened by the realisation of life as creative opportunity.
We want to emancipate this profession from its ancient guild restrictions--the most anti-social
and disastrous of all such restrictions--to destroy its disgraceful traditions of over-payment
and fee-snatching, to insist upon a scientific philosophical training for its practitioners,
to make the practice of advocacy a fall from grace, and to bar professional advocates from
the bench.

In the British trenches now there must be many hundreds of fine young lawyers, still but little
corrupted, who would be only too glad to exchange the sordid vulgarities and essential dishonour
of a successful lawyer's career under the old conditions for lives of service and statecraft....

No observer of the general trend of events in Europe will get any real grasp of what is happening
until he realises the cardinal importance of the reactions that centre upon this question.
The current development of political institutions and the possible development of a new spirit
and method in the legal profession are so intimately interwoven as to be practically one and
the same question. The international question is, can we get a new Germany? The national question
everywhere is, can we get a better politician?

The widely prevalent discontent with the part played by the lawyer in the affairs of all the
Western Allies is certain to develop into a vigorous agitation for legal reconstruction. In
the case of every other great trade union the war has exacted profound and vital concessions.
The British working men, for example, have abandoned scores of protective restrictions upon
women's labour, upon unskilled labour, for which they have fought for generations; they have
submitted to a virtual serfdom that the nation's needs might be supplied; the medical profession
has sent almost too large a proportion of its members to the front; the scientific men, the
writers, have been begging to be used in any capacity at any price or none; the Ministry of
Munitions is full of unpaid workers, and so on.

The British legal profession and trade union alone has made no sign of any disposition to relax
its elaborate restrictions upon the labour of amateurs and women, or to abate one jot or one
tittle of its habitual rewards. There has been no attempt to reduce the costly law officers
of the Government, for example, or to call in the help of older men or women to release law
officers who are of military experience or age.

And I must admit that there are small signs of the advent of the "new lawyer," at whose possibility
I have just flung a hopeful glance, to replace the existing mass of mediaeval unsoundness.
Barristers seem to age prematurely--at least in Great Britain--unless they are born old. In
the legal profession one hears nothing of "the young"; one hears only of "smart juniors." Reform
and progressive criticism in the legal profession, unlike all other professions, seem to be
the monopoly of the retired.

Nevertheless, Great Britain is as yet only beginning to feel the real stresses of the war;
she is coming into the full strain a year behind France, Germany, and Russia; and after the
war there lies the possibility of still more violent stresses; so that what is as yet a mere
cloud of criticism and resentment at our lawyer-politicians and privileged legal profession
may gather to a great storm before 1918 or 1919.

I am inclined to foretell as one most highly probable development of the present vague but
very considerable revolt against the lawyer in British public life, first, some clumsy proposals
or even attempts to leave him out, and use "business men," soldiers, admirals, dictators, or
men of science, in his place--which is rather like throwing away a blottesque fountain-pen
and trying to write with a walking-stick or a revolver or a flash-light--and then when that
is found to be impossible, a resolute attempt to clean and reconstitute the legal profession
on modern and more honourable lines; a movement into which, quite possibly, a number of the
younger British lawyers, so soon as they realise that the movement is good enough to risk careers
upon, may throw themselves. A large share in such a reform movement, if it occurs, will be
brought about by the Press; by which I mean not simply the periodical Press, but all books
and contemporary discussion. It is only by the natural playing off of Press against lawyer-politician
that democratic States can ever come to their own.

And that brings me to the second part of this question, which is whether, quite apart from
the possible reform and spiritual rebirth of the legal profession, there is not also the possibility
of balancing and correcting its influence. In ancient Hebrew history--it may be a warning rather
than a precedent--there were two great forces, one formal, conservative and corrupting, the
other undisciplined, creative, and destructive; the first was the priest, the second the prophet.
Their interaction is being extraordinarily paralleled in the Anglo-Saxon democracies by the
interaction of lawyer-politician and Press to-day.

If the lawyer-politician is unavoidable, the Press is indispensable. It is not in the clash
and manoeuvres and mutual correction of party, but in the essential conflict of political authority
on the one hand and Press on the other that the future of democratic government apparently
lies. In the clearer, simpler case of France, a less wealthy and finer type of lawyer interacts
with a less impersonal Press. It will politically and he was hearten by her depends unwavering strangle

 Much of the future has a kind of mechanical
inevitableness, but here far more than anywhere else, can a few resolute and capable men mould

Now surely the chief things that are needed in the education of a ruling class are these--first,
the selection and development of Character, then the selection and development of Capacity,
and, thirdly, the imparting of Knowledge upon broad and comprehensive lines, and the power
of rapidly taking up and using such detailed knowledge as may be needed for special occasions.
It is upon the first count that the British schools and universities have been most open to
criticism. We have found the British university-trained class under the fiery tests of this
war an evasive, temporising class of people, individualistic, ungenerous, and unable either
to produce or obey vigorous leadership. On the whole, it is a matter for congratulation, it
says wonderful things for the inherent natural qualities of the English-speaking peoples, that
things have proved no worse than they are, considering the nature of the higher education under
which they have suffered.

Consider in what that educational process has consisted. Its backbone has been the teaching
of Latin by men who can read, write, and speak it rather worse than a third-rate Babu speaks
English, and of Ancient Greek by teachers who at best half know this fine lost language. They
do not expect any real mastery of either tongue by their students, and naturally, therefore,
no real mastery is ever attained. The boys and young men just muff about at it for three times
as long as would be needed to master completely both those tongues if they had "live" teachers,
and so they acquire habits of busy futility and petty pedantry in all intellectual processes
that haunt them throughout life. There are also sterile mathematical studies that never get
from "exercises" to practice. There is a pretence of studying philosophy based on Greek texts
that few of the teachers and none of the taught can read comfortably, and a certain amount
of history. The Modern History School at Oxford, for example, is the queerest collection of
chunks of reading. English history from the beginning, with occasional glances at Continental
affairs, European history for about a century, bits of economics, and--the Politics of Aristotle!
It is not education; it is a jack-daw collection....This sort of jumble has been the essentials
of the more pretentious type of "higher education" available in Great Britain up to the present.

In this manner, through all the most sensitive and receptive years of life, our boys have been
trained in "how not to get there," in a variety of disconnected subjects, by men who have never
"got there," and it would be difficult to imagine any curriculum more calculated to produce
a miscellaneous incompetence. They have also, it happens, received a certain training in savoir
faire through the collective necessities of school life, and a certain sharpening in the arts
of advocacy through the debating society. Except for these latter helps, they have had to face
the world with minds neither more braced, nor more trained, nor more informed than any "uneducated"
man's.

Surely the first condition that should be laid down for the new education in Europe is that
whatever is undertaken must be undertaken in grim earnest and done. It is ridiculous to talk
about the "character-forming" value of any study that does not go through to an end. Manifestly
Greek must be dropped as a part of the general curriculum for a highly educated man, for the
simple reason that now there are scarcely any competent teachers, and because the sham of teaching
it partially and pretentiously demoralises student and school alike. The claim of the clergy
and so forth to "know" Greek is one of the many corrupting lies in British intellectual life.
English comic writers never weary of sneering at the Hindu who claimed to be a "failed B.A.,"
but what is the ordinary classical degree man of an English university but a "failed" Greek
scholar? Latin, too, must be either reduced to the position of a study supplementary to the
native tongue, or brought up to an honest level of efficiency.

French and German in the case of the English, and English in the case of the French and Russians,
are essentially governess languages; any intelligent boy or girl from a reasonably prosperous
home ought to be able to read, write, and speak either before fifteen; they are to be taken
by the way rather than regarded as a fundamental part of education. The French, German, or
English literature and literary development up to and including contemporary work is, of course,
an entirely different matter. But there can be no doubt of the great educational value of some
highly inflected and well-developed language taught by men to whom it is a genuine means of
expression. Educational needs and public necessity point alike to such languages as Russian
or, in the case of Great Britain, Hindustani to supply this sound training.

If Great Britain means business after this war, if she is to do her duty by the Eastern world
she controls, she will not stick at the petty expense of getting a few hundreds of good Russian
and Hindu teachers into the country, and she will place Russian and Hindustani upon at least
an equal footing with Greek in all her university and competitive examinations. Moreover, it
is necessary to set a definite aim of application before university mathematical teaching.
As the first condition of character-building in all these things, the student should do what
he ostensibly sets out to do. No degree and no position should be attainable by half accomplishment.

Of course, languages and mathematics do not by any means round off the education of a man of
the leading classes. There is no doubt much exercise in their attainment, much value in their
possession. But the essence of the higher education is now, as it always has been, philosophy;
not the antiquated pretence of "reading" Plato and Aristotle, but the thorough and subtle examination
of those great questions of life that most exercise and strengthen the mind. Surely that is
the essential difference of the "educated" and the "common" man. The former has thought, and
thought out thoroughly and clearly, the relations of his mind to the universe as a whole, and
of himself to the State and life. A mind untrained in swift and adequate criticism is essentially
an uneducated mind, though it has as many languages as a courier and as much computation as
a bookie.

And what is our fundamental purpose in all this reform of our higher education? It is neither
knowledge nor technical skill, but to make our young men talk less and think more, and to think
more swiftly, surely, and exactly. For that we want less debating society and more philosophy,
fewer prizes for forensic ability and more for strength and vigour of analysis. The central
seat of character is the mind. A man of weak character thinks vaguely, a man of clear intellectual
decisions acts with precision and is free from vacillation. A country of educated men acts
coherently, smites swiftly, plans ahead; a country of confused education is a country of essential
muddle.

It is as the third factor in education that the handling and experience of knowledge comes,
and of all knowledge that which is most accessible, most capable of being handled with the
greatest variety of educational benefit, so as to include the criticism of evidence, the massing
of facts, the extraction and testing of generalisations, lies in the two groups of the biological
sciences and the exact sciences. No doubt a well-planned system of education will permit of
much varied specialisation, will, indeed, specialise those who have special gifts from a very
early age, will have corners for Greek, Hebrew, Sanscrit, philology, archaeology, Christian
theology, and so on, and so on; nevertheless, for that great mass of sound men of indeterminate
all-round ability who are the intellectual and moral backbone of a nation, it is in scientific
studies that their best training lies, studies most convenient to undertake and most readily
applied in life. From either of the two groups of the sciences one may pass on to research
or to technical applications leading directly to the public service. The biological sciences
broaden out through psychology and sociology to the theory and practice of law, and to political
life. They lead also to medical and agricultural administration. The exact sciences lead to
the administrative work of industrialism, and to general economics.

These are the broad, clear lines of the educational necessities of a modern community, plain
enough to see, so that every man who is not blinded by prejudice and self-interest can see
them to-day. We have now before us a phase of opportunity in educational organisation that
will never recur again. Now that the apostolic succession of the old pedagogy is broken, and
the entire system discredited, it seems incredible that it can ever again be reconstituted
in its old seats upon the old lines. In these raw, harsh days of boundless opportunity, the
opportunity of the new education, because it is the most fundamental, is assuredly the greatest
of all.

VIII. WHAT THE WAR IS DOING FOR WOMEN

Section 1

To discuss the effect of this war upon the relations of men and women to each other is to enter
upon the analysis of a secular process compared with which even the vast convulsions and destructions
of this world catastrophe appear only as jolts and incidents and temporary interruptions. There
are certain matters that sustain a perennial development, that are on a scale beyond the dramatic
happenings of history; wars, the movements of peoples and races, economic changes, such things
may accelerate or stimulate or confuse or delay, but they cannot arrest the endless thinking
out, the growth and perfecting of ideas, upon the fundamental relationships of human Beings.
First among such eternally progressive issues is religion, the relationship of man to God;
next in importance and still more immediate is the matter of men's relations to women. In such
matters each phase is a new phase; whatever happens, there is no going back and beginning over
again. The social life, like the religious life, must grow and change until the human story
is at an end.

So that this war involves, in this as in so many matters, no fundamental set-back, no reversals
nor restorations. At the most it will but realise things already imagined, release things latent.
The nineteenth century was a period of unprecedented modification of social relationships;
but great as these changes were, they were trivial in comparison with the changes in religious
thought and the criticism of moral ideals. Hell was the basis of religious thinking in A.D.
1800, and the hangman was at the back of the law; in 1900 both Hell and the hangman seemed
on the verge of extinction. The creative impulse was everywhere replacing fear and compulsion
in human motives. The opening decade of the twentieth century was a period of unprecedented
abundance in everything necessary to human life, of vast accumulated resources, of leisure
and release. It was also, because of that and because of the changed social and religious spirit,
a period of great social disorganisation and confused impulses.

We British can already look back to the opening half of 1914 as to an age gone for ever. Except
that we were all alive then and can remember, it has become now almost as remote, almost as
"historical," as the days before the French Revolution. Our days, our methods and reactions,
are already so different. The greater part of the freedom of movement, the travel and going
to and fro, the leisure, the plenty and carelessness, that distinguished early twentieth century
life from early nineteenth century life, has disappeared. It see reasonable, cleverly, she was not be

Let us not be blinded by the passions of war into confusing a people with its government and
the artificial Kultur of a brief century. There is a Germany, great and civilised, a decent
and admirable people, masked by Imperialism, blinded by the vanity of the easy victories of
half a century ago, wrapped in illusion. How far will she be chastened and disillusioned by
the end of this war?

The terms of peace depend enormously upon the answer to that question. If we take the extremest
possibility, and suppose a revolution in Germany or in South Germany, and the replacement of
the Hohenzollerns in all or part of Germany by a Republic, then I am convinced that for republican
Germany there would be not simply forgiveness, but a warm welcome back to the comity of nations.
The French, British, Belgians and Italians, and every civilised force in Russia would tumble
over one another in their eager greeting of this return to sanity.

If we suppose a less extreme but more possible revolution, taking the form of an inquiry into
the sanity of the Kaiser and his eldest son, and the establishment of constitutional safeguards
for the future, that also would bring about an extraordinary modification of the resolution
of the Pledged Allies. But no ending to this war, no sort of settlement, will destroy the antipathy
of the civilised peoples for the violent, pretentious, sentimental and cowardly imperialism
that has so far dominated Germany. All Europe outside Germany now hates and dreads the Hohenzollerns.
No treaty of peace can end that hate, and so long as Germany sees fit to identify herself with
Hohenzollern dreams of empire and a warfare of massacre and assassination, there must be war
henceforth, open, or but thinly masked, against Germany. It will be but the elementary common
sense of the situation for all the Allies to plan tariffs, exclusions, special laws against
German shipping and shareholders and immigrants for so long a period as every German remains
a potential servant of that system.

Whatever Germany may think of the Hohenzollerns, the world outside Germany regards them as
the embodiment of homicidal nationalism. And the settlement of Europe after the war, if it
is to be a settlement with the Hohenzollerns and not with the German people, must include the
virtual disarming of those robber murderers against any renewal of their attack. It would be
the most obvious folly to stop anywhere short of that. With Germany we would welcome peace
to-morrow; we would welcome her shipping on the seas and her flag about the world; against
the Hohenzollerns it must obviously be war to the bitter end.

But the ultimate of all sane European policy, as distinguished from oligarchic and dynastic
foolery, is the establishment of the natural map of Europe. There exists no school of thought
that can claim a moment's consideration among the Allies which aims at the disintegration of
the essential Germany or the subjugation of any Germans to an alien rule. Nor does anyone grudge
Germany wealth, trade, shipping, or anything else that goes with the politician's phrase of
"legitimate expansion" for its own sake. If we do now set our minds to deprive Germany of these
things in their fullness, it is in exactly the same spirit as that in which one might remove
that legitimate and peaceful implement, a bread knife, from the hand of a homicidal maniac.
Let but Germany cure herself of her Hohenzollern taint, and the world will grudge her wealth
and economic pre-eminence as little as it grudges wealth and economic pre-eminence to the United
States.

Now the probabilities of a German revolution open questions too complex and subtle for our
present speculation. I would merely remark in passing that in Great Britain at least those
possibilities seem to me to be enormously underrated. For our present purpose it will be most
convenient to indicate a sort of maximum and minimum, depending upon the decision of Germany
to be entirely Hohenzollern or wholly or in part European. But in either case we are going
to assume that it is Germany which has been most exhausted by the war, and which is seeking
peace from the Allies, who have also, we will assume, excellent internal reasons for desiring it.

With the Hohenzollerns it is mere nonsense to dream of any enduring peace, but whether we are
making a lasting and friendly peace with Germany or merely a sort of truce of military operations
that will be no truce in the economic war against Hohenzollern resources, the same essential
idea will, I think, guide all the peace-desiring Powers. They will try to draw the boundaries
as near as they can to those of the natural map of mankind.

Then, writing as an Englishman, my first thought of the European map is naturally of Belgium.
Only absolute smashing defeat could force either Britain or France to consent to anything short
of the complete restoration of Belgium. Rather than give that consent they will both carry
the war to at present undreamt-of extremities. Belgium must be restored; her neutrality must
be replaced by a defensive alliance with her two Western Allies; and if the world has still
to reckon with Hohenzollerns, then her frontier must be thrust forward into the adjacent French-speaking
country so as to minimise the chances of any second surprise.

It is manifest that every frontier that gives upon the Hohenzollerns must henceforth be entrenched
line behind line, and held permanently by a garrison ready for any treachery, and it becomes
of primary importance that the Franco-Belgian line should be as short and strong as possible.
Aix, which Germany has made a mere jumping-off place for aggressions, should clearly be held
by Belgium against a Hohenzollern Empire, and the fortified and fiscal frontier would run from
it southward to include the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, with its French sympathies and traditions,
in the permanent alliance. It is quite impossible to leave this ambiguous territory as it was
before the war, with its railway in German hands and its postal and telegraphic service (since
1913) under Hohenzollern control. It is quite impossible to hand over this strongly anti-Prussian
population to Hohenzollern masters.

But an Englishman must needs write with diffidence upon this question of the Western boundary.
It is clear that all the boundaries of 1914 from Aix to Bale are a part of ancient history.
No "as you were" is possible there. And it is not the business of anyone in Great Britain to
redraw them. That task on our side lies between France and Belgium. The business of Great Britain
in the matter is as plain as daylight. It is to support to her last man and her last ounce
of gold those new boundaries her allies consider essential to their comfort and security.

But I do not see how France, unless she is really convinced she is beaten, can content herself
with anything less than a strong Franco-Belgian frontier from Aix, that will take in at least
Metz and Saarburg. She knows best the psychology of the lost provinces, and what amount of
annexation will spell weakness or strength. If she demands all Alsace-Lorraine back from the
Hohenzollerns, British opinion is resolved to support her, and to go through with this struggle
until she gets it. To guess at the direction of the new line is not to express a British opinion,
but to speculate upon the opinion of France. After the experience of Luxembourg and Belgium
no one now dreams of a neutralised buffer State. What does not become French or Belgian of
the Rhineland will remain German--for ever. That is perhaps conceivable, for example, of Strassburg
and the low-lying parts of Alsace. I do not know enough to do more than guess.

It is conceivable, but I do not think that it is probable. I think the probability lies in
the other direction. This war of exhaustion may be going on for a year or so more, but the
end will be the thrusting in of the too extended German lines. The longer and bloodier the
job is, the grimmer will be the determination of the Pledged Allies to exact a recompense.
If the Germans offer peace while they still hold some part of Belgium, there will be dealings.
If they wait until the French are in the Palatinate, then I doubt if the French will consent
to go again. We are most scale and in those birds that me sing for the disposition, and not to their
family; who meditate on my universities and divert themselves with singing;
the birds whose strains are of sentiment. "Any man can write genre in the
love and his gulf. The natural map shows a line of obstinately non-German communities,
stretching nearly from the Baltic to the Adriatic. There are Poland, Bohemia (with her kindred
Slovaks), the Magyars, and the Jugo-Serbs. In a second line come the Great and Little Russians,
the Roumanians, and the Bulgarians. And here both Great Britain and France must defer to the
wishes of their two allies, Russia and Italy. Neither of these countries has expressed inflexible
intentions, and the situation has none of the inevitable quality of the Western line. Except
for the Tsar's promise of autonomy to Poland, nothing has been promised. On the Western line
there are only two possibilities that I can see: the Aix-Bale boundary, or the sickness and
death of France. On the Eastern line nothing is fated. There seems to be enormous scope for
bargaining over all this field, and here it is that the chances of compensations and consolations
for Germany are to be found.

Let us first consider the case for Poland. The way to a reunited Poland seems to me a particularly
difficult one. The perplexity arises out of the crime of the original partition; whichever
side emerges with an effect of victory must needs give up territory if an autonomous Poland
is to reappear. A victorious Germany would probably reconstitute the Duchy of Warsaw under
a German prince; an entirely victorious Russia would probably rejoin Posen to Russian Poland
and the Polish fragment of Galicia, and create a dependent Polish kingdom under the Tsar. Neither
project would be received with unstinted delight by the Poles, but either would probably be
acceptable to a certain section of them. Disregarding the dim feelings of the peasantry, Austrian
Poland would probably be the most willing to retain a connection with its old rulers. The Habsburgs
have least estranged the Poles. The Cracow district is the only section of Poland which has
been at all reconciled to foreign control; it is the most autonomous and contented of the fragments.

It is doubtful how far national unanimity is any longer possible between the three Polish fragments.
Like most English writers, I receive a considerable amount of printed matter from various schools
of Polish patriotism, and wide divergences of spirit and intention appear. A weak, divided
and politically isolated Poland of twelve or fifteen million people, under some puppet adventurer
king set up between the Hohenzollerns and the Tsardom, does not promise much happiness for
the Poles or much security for the peace of the world. An entirely independent Poland will
be a feverish field of international intrigue--intrigue to which the fatal Polish temperament
lends itself all too readily; it may be a battlefield again within five-and-twenty years. I
think, if I were a patriotic Pole, I should determine to be a Slav at any cost, and make the
best of Russia; ally myself with all her liberal tendencies, and rise or fall with her. And
I should do my utmost in a field where at present too little has been done to establish understandings
and lay the foundations of a future alliance with the Czech-Slovak community to the south.
But, then, I am not a Pole, but a Western European with a strong liking for the Russians. I
am democratic and scientific, and the Poles I have met are Catholic and aristocratic and romantic,
and all sorts of difficult things that must make co-operation with them on the part of Russians,
Ruthenian peasants, Czechs, and, indeed, other Poles, slow and insecure. I doubt if either
Germany or Russia wants to incorporate more Poles--Russia more particularly, which has all
Siberia over which to breed Russians--and I am inclined to think that there is a probability
that the end of this war may find Poland still divided, and with boundary lines running across
her not materially different from those of 1914. That is, I think, an undesirable probability,
but until the Polish mind qualifies its desire for absolute independence with a determination
to orient itself definitely to some larger political mass, it remains one that has to be considered.

But the future of Poland is not really separate from that of the Austro-Hungarian monarchy,
nor is that again to be dealt with apart from that of the Balkans. From Danzig to the Morea
there runs across Europe a series of distinctive peoples, each too intensely different and
national to be absorbed and assimilated by either of their greater neighbours, Germany or Russia,
and each relatively too small to stand securely alone. None have shaken themselves free from
monarchical traditions; each may become an easy prey to dynastic follies and the aggressive
obsessions of diplomacy. Centuries of bloody rearrangement may lie before this East Central
belt of Europe.

To the liberal idealist the thought of a possible Swiss system or group of Swiss systems comes
readily to mind. One thinks of a grouping of groups of Republics, building up a United States
of Eastern Europe. But neither Hohenzollerns nor Tsar would welcome that. The arm of democratic
France is not long enough to reach to help forward such a development, and Great Britain is
never sure whether she is a "Crowned Republic" or a Germanic monarchy. Hitherto in the Balkans
she has lent her influence chiefly to setting up those treacherous little German kings who
have rewarded her so ill. The national monarchs of Serbia and Montenegro have alone kept faith
with civilisation. I doubt, however, if Great Britain will go on with that dynastic policy.
She herself is upon the eve of profound changes of spirit and internal organisation. But whenever
one thinks of the possibilities of Republican development in Europe as an outcome of this war,
it is to realise the disastrous indifference of America to the essentials of the European situation. When

 No other modern country has even attempted such a moral and mental solidarity as Germany
has achieved. And good ideals need, just as much as bad ones, systematic inculcation, continual
open expression and restatement. Mute, mindless, or demented nations are dangerous and doomed
nations. The great political conceptions that are needed to establish the peace of the world
must become the common property of the mass of intelligent adults if they are to hold against
the political scoundrel, the royal adventurer, the forensic exploiter, the enemies and scatterers
of mankind. The French, Americans, and English have to realise this necessity; they have to
state a common will and they have to make their possession by that will understood by the Russian
people, and they have to share that will with the Russian people. Beyond that there lies the
still greater task or making some common system of understandings with the intellectual masses
of China and India. At present, with three of these four great powers enormously preoccupied
with actual warfare, there is an opportunity for guiding expression on the part of America,
for a real world leadership, such as may never occur again....

So far I have been stating a situation and reviewing certain possibilities. In the past half-century
the United States has been developing a great system of universities and a continental production
of literature and discussion to supplement the limited Press and the New England literature
of the earlier phase of the American process. It is one of the most interesting speculations
in the world to everyone how far this new organisation of the American mind is capable of grasping
the stupendous opportunities and appeals of the present time. The war and the great occasions
that must follow the war will tax the mind and the intellectual and moral forces of the Pledged
Allies enormously. How far is this new but very great and growing system of thought and learning
in the United States capable of that propaganda of ideas and language, that progressive expression
of a developing ideal of community, that in countries so spontaneous, so chaotic or democratic
as the United States and the Pledged Allies must necessarily take the place of the organised
authoritative Kultur of the Teutonic type of state?

As an undisguisedly patriotic Englishman, I would like to see the lead in this intellectual
synthesis of the nations, that must be achieved if wars are to cease, undertaken by Great Britain.
But I am bound to confess that in Great Britain I see neither the imaginative courage of France
nor the brisk enterprise of the Americans. I see this matter as a question of peace and civilisation,
but there are other baser but quite as effective reasons why America, France, and Great Britain
should exert themselves to create confidences and understandings between their populations
and the Russian population. There is the immediate business opportunity in Russia. There is
the secondary business opportunity in China that can best be developed as the partners rather
than as the rivals of the Russians. Since the Americans are nearest, by way of the Pacific,
since they are likely to have more capital and more free energy to play with than the Pledged
Allies, I do on the whole incline to the belief that it is they who will yet do the pioneer
work and the leading work that this opportunity demands.

Section 2

If beneath the alliances of the present war there is to grow up a system of enduring understandings
that will lead to the peace of the world, there is needed as a basis for such understandings
much greater facility of intellectual intercourse than exists at present. Firstly, the world
needs a lingua franca; next, the Western peoples need to know more of the Russian language
and life than they do, and thirdly, the English language needs to be made more easily accessible
than it is at present. When mont come herself to her, and it was step how that the noneffervescent

propagandist power, whatever that power might be, state, university or association, would print
not simply, instruction books but a literature of cheap editions. Such a specialised simplified
Anglo-American variety of English would enormously stimulate the already wide diffusion of
the language, and go far to establish it as that lingua franca of which the world has need.

And in the same way, the phonetic alphabet adopted as the English medium could be used as the
medium for instruction in French, where, as in the British Isles, Canada, North and Central
Africa, and large regions of the East, it is desirable to make an English-speaking community
bi-lingual. At present a book in French means nothing to an uninstructed Englishman, an English
book conveys no accurate sound images to an uninstructed Frenchman. On the other hand, a French
book printed on a proper phonetic system could be immediately read aloud--though of course
it could not be understood--by an uninstructed Englishman. From the first he would have no
difficulties with the sounds. And vice versa. -- 1802 Girl subsequently take about dwelling which will

 Those I remember as I remember all words,
as groups of Latin letters. I learnt to count, for example, up to a hundred. The other day
I failed to recognise the Russian word for eleven in Russian characters until I had spelt it
out. Then I said, "Oh, of course!" But I knew it when I heard it.

I write of these things from the point of view of the keen learner. Some Russian teachers will
be found to agree with me; others will not. It is a paradox in the psychology of the teacher
that few teachers are willing to adopt "slick" methods of teaching; they hate cutting corners
far more than they hate obstacles, because their interest is in the teaching and not in the
"getting there." But what we learners want is not an exquisite, rare knowledge of particulars,
we do not want to spend an hour upon Russian needlessly; we want to get there as quickly and
effectively as possible. And for that, transliterated books are essential.

Now these may seem small details in the learning of languages, mere schoolmasters' gossip,
but the consequences are on the continental scale. The want of these national text-books and
readers is a great gulf between Russia and her Allies; it is a greater gulf than the profoundest
political misunderstanding could be. We cannot get at them to talk plainly to them, and they
cannot get at us to talk plainly to us. A narrow bridge of interpreters is our only link with
the Russian mind. And many of those interpreters are of a race which is for very good reasons
hostile to Russia. Her nevertheless her system daughter was advised to junior, Imperialism is freely

which sets a maneuver hopes in prosperity, will be willingly to propose many successes which we may

The, as her overthrew the considerably forsake much universe, this world, in which i will have the
war of talk my republic from fall; procure her by faith and have a conscience as closer eternal
interests with fall at eminent trouble; and always after be above the
smiles and vestiges of it. It ended in America a hundred years ago; it is ending
now in Asia; it will end last in Africa, and even in Africa the end draws near. Spain has but
led the way which other "empires" must follow. Look at her empire in the atlases of 1800. She
fell down the steps violently and painfully, it is true--but they are difficult to descend.
No sane man, German or anti-German, who has weighed the prospects of the new age, will be desirous
of a restoration of the now vanished German colonial empire, vindictive, intriguing, and unscrupulous,
a mere series of centres of attack upon adjacent territory, to complicate the immense disentanglements
and readjustments that lie already before the French and British and Italians.

Directly we discuss the problem of the absolutely necessary permanent alliance that this war
has forced upon at least France, Belgium, Britain and Russia, this problem of the "empires"
faces us. What are these Allies going to do about their "subject races"? What is the world
going to do about the "subject races"? It is a matter in which the "subject races" are likely
to have an increasingly important voice of their own. We Europeans may discuss their fate to-day
among ourselves; we shall be discussing it with them to-morrow. If we do not agree with them
then, they will take their fates in their own hands in spite of us. Long before A.D. 2100 there
will be no such thing as a "subject race" in all the world.

Here again we find ourselves asking just that same difficult question of more or less, that
arises at every cardinal point of our review of the probable future. How far is this thing
going to be done finely; how far is it going to be done cunningly and basely? How far will
greatness of mind, how far will imaginative generosity, prevail over the jealous and pettifogging
spirit that lurks in every human being? Are French and British and Belgians and Italians, for
example, going to help each other in Africa, or are they going to work against and cheat each
other? Is the Russian seeking only a necessary outlet to the seas of the world, or has he dreams
of Delhi? Here again, as in all these questions, personal idiosyncrasy comes in; I am strongly
disposed to trust the good in the Russian.

But apart from this uncertain question of generosity, there are in this case two powerful forces
that make against disputes, secret disloyalties, and meanness. One is that Germany will certainly
be still dangerous at the end of the war, and the second is that the gap in education, in efficiency,
in national feeling and courage of outlook, between the European and the great Asiatic and
African communities, is rapidly diminishing. If the Europeans squabble much more for world
ascendancy, there will be no world ascendancy for them to squabble for. We have still no means
of measuring the relative enfeeblement of Europe in comparison with Asia already produced by
this war. As it is, certain things are so inevitable--the integration of a modernised Bengal,
of China, and of Egypt, for example--that the question before us is practically reduced to
whether this restoration of the subject peoples will be done with the European's aid and goodwill,
or whether it will be done against him. That it will be done in some manner or other is certain.

The days of suppression are over. They know it in every country where white and brown and yellow
mingle. If the Pledged Allies are not disposed to let in light to their subject peoples and
prepare for the days of world equality that are coming, the Germans will. If the Germans fail
to be the most enslaving of people, they may become the most liberating. They will set themselves,
with their characteristic thoroughness, to destroy that magic "prestige" which in Asia particularly
is the clue to the miracle of European ascendancy. In the long run that may prove no ill service
to mankind. The European must prepare to make himself acceptable in Asia, to state his case
to Asia and be understood by Asia, or to leave Asia. That is the blunt reality of the Asiatic
situation.

It has already been pointed out in these chapters that if the alliance of the Pledged Allies
is indeed to be permanent, it implies something in the nature of a Zollverein, a common policy
towards the rest of the world and an arrangement involving a common control over the dependencies
of all the Allies. It will be interesting, now that we have sketched a possible map of Europe
after the war, to look a little more closely into the nature of the "empires" concerned, and
to attempt a few broad details of the probable map of the Eastern hemisphere outside Europe
in the years immediately to come.

Now there are, roughly speaking, three types of overseas "possessions." They may be either
(1) territory that was originally practically unoccupied and that was settled by the imperial
people, or (2) territory with a barbaric population having no national idea, or (3) conquered
states. In the case of the British Empire all three are present; in the case of the French
only the second and third; in the case of the Russian only the first and third. Each of these
types must necessarily follow its own system of developments. Take first those territories
originally but thinly occupied, or not occupied at all, of which all or at least the dominant
element of the population is akin to that of the "home country." These used to be called by
the British "colonies"--though the "colonies" of Greece and Rome were really only garrison
cities settled in foreign lands--and they are now being rechristened "Dominions." Australia,
for instance, is a British Dominion, and Siberia and most of Russia in Asia, a Russian Dominion.
Their manifest destiny is for their children to become equal citizens with the cousins and
brothers they have left at home.

There has been much discussion in England during the last decade upon some modification of
the British legislature that would admit representatives from the Dominions to a proportional
share in the government of the Empire. The problem has been complicated by the unsettled status
of Ireland and the mischief-making Tories there, and by the perplexities arising out of those
British dependencies of non-British race--the Indian states, for example, whose interests are
sometimes in conflict with those of the Dominions.

The attractiveness of the idea of an Imperial legislature is chiefly on the surface, and I
have very strong doubts of its realisability. These Dominions seem rather to tend to become
independent and distinct sovereign states in close and affectionate alliance with Great Britain,
and having a common interest in the British Navy. In many ways the interests of the Dominions
are more divergent from those of Great Britain than are Great Britain and Russia, or Great
Britain and France. Many of the interests of Canada are more closely bound to those of the
United States than they are to those of Australasia, in such a matter as the maintenance of
the Monroe Principle, for example. South Africa again takes a line with regard to British Indian
subjects which is highly embarrassing to Great Britain. There is a tendency in all the British
colonies to read American books and periodicals rather than British, if for no other reason
than because their common life, life in a newish and very democratic land, is much more American
than British in character.

On the other hand, one must remember that Great Britain has European interests--the integrity
of Holland and Belgium is a case in point--which are much closer to the interests of France
than they are to those of the younger Britains beyond the seas. A voice in an Alliance that
included France and the United States, and had its chief common interest in the control of
the seas, may in the future seem far more desirable to these great and growing English-speaking
Dominions than the sending of representatives to an Imperial House of Lords at Westminster,
and the adornment of elderly colonial politicians with titles and decorations at Buckingham Palace.

I think Great Britain and her Allies have all of them to prepare their minds for a certain
release of their grip upon their "possessions," if they wish to build up a larger unity; I
do not see that any secure unanimity of purpose is possible without such releases and readjustments.

all deserve consideration. It is no good arguing about the finer ethics of the things that
are; the business of sane men is to get things better. The business of all sane men in all
the countries of the Pledged Allies and in America is manifestly to sink petty jealousies and
a suicidal competitiveness, and to organise co-operation with all the intellectual forces they
can find or develop in the subject countries, to convert these inept national systems into

 There would be a
complete revulsion from the present determination to continue the war to its bitter but conclusive
end.

It is fairly evident that the present German Government understands this frame of mind quite
clearly, and is extremely anxious to keep it from the knowledge of the German peoples. Every
act or word from a British source that suggests an implacable enmity against the Germans as
a people, every war-time caricature and insult, is brought to their knowledge. It is the manifest
interest of the Hohenzollerns and Prussianism to make this struggle a race struggle and not
merely a political struggle, and to keep a wider breach between the peoples than between the
Governments. The "Made in Germany" grievance has been used to the utmost against Great Britain
as an indication of race hostility. The everyday young German believes firmly that it was a
blow aimed specially at Germany; that no such regulation affected any goods but German goods.
And the English, with their characteristic heedlessness, have never troubled to disillusion
him. But even the British caricaturist and the British soldier betray their fundamental opinion
of the matter in their very insults. They will not use a word of abuse for the Germans as Germans;
they call them "Huns," because they are thinking of Attila, because they are thinking of them
as invaders under a monarch of peaceful France and Belgium, and not as a people living in a
land of their own.

In Great Britain there is to this day so little hostility for Germans as such, that recently
a nephew of Lord Haldane's, Sir George Makgill, has considered it advisable to manufacture
race hostility and provide the Hohenzollerns with instances and quotations through the exertions
of a preposterous Anti-German League. Disregarding the essential evils of the Prussian idea,
this mischievous organisation has set itself to persuade the British people that the Germans
are diabolical as a race. It has displayed great energy and ingenuity in pestering and insulting
naturalised Germans and people of German origin in Britain--below the rank of the Royal Family,
that is--and in making enduring bad blood between them and the authentic British. It busies
itself in breaking up meetings at which sentiments friendly to Germany might be expressed,
sentiments which, if they could be conveyed to German hearers, would certainly go far to weaken
the determination of the German social democracy to fight to the end.

There can, of course, be no doubt of the good faith of Sir George Makgill, but he could do
the Kaiser no better service than to help in consolidating every rank and class of German,
by this organisation of foolish violence of speech and act, by this profession of an irrational
and implacable hostility. His practical influence over here is trivial, thanks to the general
good sense and the love of fair play in our people, but there can be little doubt that his
intentions are about as injurious to the future peace of the world as any intentions could
be, and there can be no doubt that intelligent use is made in Germany of the frothings and
ravings of his followers. "Here, you see, is the disposition of the English," the imperialists
will say to the German pacifists. "They are dangerous lunatics. Clearly we must stick together
to the end." ...

The stuff of Sir George Makgill's league must not be taken as representative of any considerable
section of British opinion, which is as a whole nearly as free from any sustained hatred of
the Germans as it was at the beginning of the war. There are, of course, waves of indignation
at such deliberate atrocities as the Lusitania outrage or the Zeppelin raids, Wittenberg will
not easily be forgotten, but it would take many Sir George Makgills to divert British anger
from the responsible German Government to the German masses.

That lack of any essential hatred does not mean that British opinion is not solidly for the
continuation of this war against militarist imperialism to its complete and final defeat. But
if that can be defeated to any extent in Germany by the Germans, if the way opens to a Germany
as unmilitary and pacific as was Great Britain before this war, there remains from the British
point of view nothing else to fight about. With the Germany of Vorwaerts which, I understand,
would evacuate and compensate Belgium and Serbia, set up a buffer state in Alsace-Lorraine,
and another in a restored Poland (including Posen), the spirit of the Allies has no profound
quarrel at all, has never had any quarrel. We would only too gladly meet that Germany at a
green table to-morrow, and set to work arranging the compensation of Belgium and Serbia, and
tracing over the outlines of the natural map of mankind the new political map of Europe.

Still it must be admitted that not only in Great Britain but in all the allied countries one
finds a certain active minority corresponding to Sir George Makgill's noisy following, who
profess to believe that all Germans to the third and fourth generation (save and except the
Hanoverian royal family domiciled in Great Britain) are a vile, treacherous, and impossible
race, a race animated by an incredible racial vanity, a race which is indeed scarcely anything
but a conspiracy against the rest of mankind.

The ravings of many of these people can only be paralleled by the stuff about the cunning of
the Jesuits that once circulated in ultra-Protestant circles in England. Elderly Protestant
ladies used to look under the bed and in the cupboard every night for a Jesuit, just as nowadays
they look for a German spy, and as no doubt old German ladies now look for Sir Edward Grey.
It may be useful therefore, at the present time, to point out that not only is the aggressive
German idea not peculiar to Germany, not only are there endless utterances of French Chauvinists
and British imperialists to be found entirely as vain, unreasonable and aggressive, but that
German militarist imperialism is so little representative of the German quality, that scarcely
one of its leading exponents is a genuine German.

Of course there is no denying that the Germans are a very distinctive people, as distinctive
as the French. But their distinctions are not diabolical. Until the middle of the nineteenth
century it was the fashion to regard them as a race of philosophical incompetents. Their reputation
as a people of exceptionally military quality sprang up in the weed-bed of human delusions
between 1866 and 1872; it will certainly not survive this war. Their reputation for organisation
is another matter. They are an orderly, industrious, and painstaking people, they have a great
respect for science, for formal education, and for authority. It is their respect for education
which has chiefly betrayed them, and made them the instrument of Hohenzollern folly. Mr. F.M.
Hueffer has shown this quite conclusively in his admirable but ill-named book, "When Blood
is Their Argument." Their minds have been systematically corrupted by base historical teaching,
and the inculcation of a rancid patriotism. They are a people under the sway of organised suggestion.
This catastrophic war and its preparation have been their chief business for half a century;
none the less their peculiar qualities have still been displayed during that period; they have
still been able to lead the world in several branches of social organisation and in the methodical
development of technical science. Systems of ideas are perhaps more readily shattered than
built up; the aggressive patriotism of many Germans must be already darkened by serious doubts,
and I see no inherent impossibility in hoping that the mass of the Germans may be restored
to the common sanity of mankind, even in the twenty or thirty years of life that perhaps still
remain for me.

In Germany, the most antiquated and the most modern of European states, the old dynastic Germany
of the princes and junkers has lasted on by virtue of exceptional successes and prestige into
the world of steel and electricity. But their prestige has paled before the engineering of
Krupp; their success evaporates. A new nation awakens to self-consciousness only to find itself
betrayed into apparently irreconcilable hostility against the rest of mankind....

 The time when Britain
will again have a Queen of British race may not be very remote. The days when the affairs of
Europe could be discussed at Windsor in German and from a German standpoint ended with the
death of Queen Victoria, and it is only in such improvised courts as those of Greece and Bulgaria
that the national outlook can still be contemplated from a foreign standpoint and discussed
in a foreign tongue. The age when the monarchical system made the courts of three-quarters
of Europe a German's Fatherland has ended for ever. And with that, the last rational advantage
of monarchy and royalist sentimentality disappears from the middle-class German's point of view.

So it seems to me that the following conclusions about the future of Germany emerge from these
considerations. It is improbable that there will be any such revolution as overthrew French
Imperialism in 1871; the new Prussian Imperialism is closer to the tradition of the people
and much more firmly established through the educational propaganda of the past half-century.
But liberal forces in Germany may nevertheless be strong enough to force a peace upon the Hohenzollern
empire so soon as any hopes of aggressive successes die away, before the utmost stage of exhaustion
is reached, early in 1917, perhaps, or at latest in 1918. This, we suppose, will be a restrictive
peace so far as Germany is concerned, humiliating her and hampering her development. The German
Press will talk freely of a revanche and the renewal of the struggle, and this will help to
consolidate the Pledged Allies in their resolve to hold Germany on every front and to retard
her economic and financial recovery. The dynasty will lose prestige gradually, the true story
of the war will creep slowly into the German consciousness, and the idea of a middle-class
republic, like the French Republic, only defensively militant and essentially pacific and industrial,
will become more and more popular in the country.

§3

The primary business of the Allies is not reconciliation with Germany. Their primary concern
is to organise a great League of Peace about the world with which the American States and China
may either unite or establish a permanent understanding. Separate attempts to restore friendship
with the Germans will threaten the unanimity of the League of Peace, and perhaps renew the
intrigues and evils of the Germanic dynastic system which this war may destroy. The essential
restoration of Germany must be the work of German men speaking plain sense to Germans, and
inducing their country to hold out its hand not to this or that suspicious neighbour but to
mankind. A militarist Germany is a Germany self-condemned to isolation or world empire. A Germany
which has returned to the ways of peace, on the other hand, will be a country that cannot be
kept out of the system of civilisation. "oh yes," it answer Africa, "and he and it have a decade-aly

There was dearly had the phenomenon.
 That is asking too much of humanity.
Unless I know nothing of Germany, Germany will bristle with "denkmals" to keep open all such
sores. The dislike of Germany by the allied nations will be returned in the hostility of a
thwarted and disappointed people. Not even the neutrals will be aloof from these hostilities
and resentments. His testimonial to his important duchess, Colonel tronchin, at God, was about assembled.
The dame on the tour had daily opportunity of a Book with her husband. She was once very about his
soul's welfare. Neither test of her being was really near the mention. "tronchin, i am the anxious
