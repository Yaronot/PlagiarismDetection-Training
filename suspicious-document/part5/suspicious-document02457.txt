CHAPTER I.

SALAAM.

The Western student is apt to be somewhat confused in his ideas regarding the Yogis and their
philosophy and practice. Travelers to India have written great tales about the hordes of fakirs,
mendicants and mountebanks who infest the great roads of India and the streets of its cities,
and who impudently claim the title "Yogi." The Western student is scarcely to be blamed for
thinking of the typical Yogi as an emaciated, fanatical, dirty, ignorant Hindu, who either
sits in a fixed posture until his body becomes ossified, or else holds his arm up in the air
until it becomes stiff and withered and forever after remains in that position, or perhaps
clenches his fist and holds it tight until his fingernails grow through the palms of his hands.
That these people exist is true, but their claim to the title "Yogi" seems as absurd to the
true Yogi as does the claim to the title "Doctor" on the part of the man who pares one's corns
seem to the eminent surgeon, or as does the title of "Professor," as assumed by the street
corner vendor of worm medicine, seem to the President of Harvard or Yale.

There have been for ages past in India and other Oriental countries men who devoted their time
and attention to the development of Man, physically, mentally and spiritually. The experience
of generations of earnest seekers has been handed down for centuries from teacher to pupil,
and gradually a definite Yogi science was built up. To these investigations and teachings was
finally applied the term "Yogi," from the Sanscrit word "Yug," meaning "to join." From the
same source comes the English word "yoke," with a similar meaning. Its use in connection with
these teachings is difficult to trace, different authorities giving different explanations,
but probably the most ingenious is that which holds that it is intended as the Hindu equivalent
for the idea conveyed by the English phrase, "getting into harness," or "yoking up," as the
Yogi undoubtedly "gets into harness" in his work of controlling the body and mind by the Will.

Yoga is divided into several branches, ranging from that which teaches the control of the body,
to that which teaches the attainment of the highest spiritual development. In the work we will
not go into the higher phases of the subject, except when the "Science of Breath" touches upon
the same. The "Science of Breath" touches Yoga at many points, and although chiefly concerned
with the development and control of the physical, has also its psychic side, and even enters
the field of spiritual development.

In India there are great schools of Yoga, comprising thousands of the leading minds of that
great country. The Yoga philosophy is the rule of life for many people. The pure Yogi teachings,
however, are given only to the few, the masses being satisfied with the crumbs which fall from
the tables of the educated classes, the Oriental custom in this respect being opposed to that
of the Western world. But Western ideas are beginning to have their effect even in the Orient,
and teachings which were once given only to the few are now freely offered to any who are ready
to receive them. The East and the West are growing closer together, and both are profiting
by the close contact, each influencing the other.

The Hindu Yogis have always paid great attention to the Science of Breath, for reasons which
will be apparent to the student who reads this book. Many Western writers have touched upon
this phase of the Yogi teachings, but we believe that it has been reserved for the writer of
this work to give to the Western student, in concise form and simple language, the underlying
principles of the Yogi Science of Breath, together with many of the favorite Yogi breathing
exercises and methods. We have given the Western idea as well as the Oriental, showing how
one dovetails into the other. We have used the ordinary English terms, almost entirely, avoiding
the Sanscrit terms, so confusing to the average Western reader.

The first part of the book is devoted to the physical phase of the Science of Breath; then
the psychic and mental sides are considered, and finally the spiritual side is touched upon.

We may be pardoned if we express ourselves as pleased with our success in condensing so much
Yogi lore into so few pages, and by the use of words and terms which may be understood by anyone.
Our only fear is that its very simplicity may cause some to pass it by as unworthy of attention,
while they pass on their way searching for something "deep," mysterious and non-understandable.
However, the Western mind is eminently practical, and we know that it is only a question of
a short time before it will recognize the practicability of this work.

We greet our students, with our most profound salaam, and bid them be seated for their first
lessons in the Yogi Science of Breath.

CHAPTER II.

"BREATH IS LIFE."

Life is absolutely dependent upon the act of breathing. "Breath is Life."

Differ as they may upon details of theory and terminology, the Oriental and the Occidental
agree upon these fundamental principles.

To breathe is to live, and without breath there is no life. Not only are the higher animals
dependent upon breath for life and health, but even the lower forms of animal life must breathe
to live, and plant life is likewise dependent upon the air for continued existence.

The infant draws in a long, deep breath, retains it for a moment to extract from it its life-giving
properties, and then exhales it in a long wail, and lo! its life upon earth has begun. The
old man gives a faint gasp, ceases to breathe, and life is over. From the first faint breath
of the infant to the last gasp of the dying man, it is one long story of continued breathing.
Life is but a series of breaths.

Breathing may be considered the most important of all of the functions of the body, for, indeed,
all the other functions depend upon it. Man may exist some time without eating; a shorter time
without drinking; but without breathing his existence may be measured by a few minutes.

And not only is Man dependent upon Breath for life, but he is largely dependent upon correct
habits of breathing for continued vitality and freedom from disease. An intelligent control
of our breathing power will lengthen our days upon earth by giving us increased vitality and
powers of resistance, and, on the other hand, unintelligent and careless breathing will tend
to shorten our days, by decreasing our vitality and laying us open to disease.

Man in his normal state had no need of instruction in breathing. Like the lower animal and
the child, he breathed naturally and properly, as nature intended him to do, but civilization
has changed him in this and other respects. He has contracted improper methods and attitudes
of walking, standing and sitting, which have robbed him of his birthright of natural and correct
breathing. He has paid a high price for civilization. The savage, to-day, breathes naturally,
unless he has been contaminated by the habits of civilized man.

The percentage of civilized men who breathe correctly is quite small, and the result is shown
in contracted chests and stooping shoulders, and the terrible increase in diseases of the respiratory
organs, including that dread monster, Consumption, "the white scourge." Eminent authorities
have stated that one generation of correct breathers would regenerate the race, and disease
would be so rare as to be looked upon as a curiosity. Whether looked at from the standpoint
of the Oriental or Occidental, the connection between correct breathing and health is readily
seen and explained.

The Occidental teachings show that the physical health depends very materially upon correct
breathing. That refuse than our old ribs are a disposal-and, have him lend they inhale to acknowledge

The Organs of Respiration consist of the lungs and the air passages leading to them. The lungs
are two in number, and occupy the pleural chamber of the thorax, one en each side of the median
line, being separated from each other by the heart, the greater blood vessels and the larger
air tubes. Each lung is free in all directions, except at the root, which consists chiefly
of the bronchi, arteries and veins connecting the lungs with the trachea and heart. The lungs
are spongy and porous, and their tissues are very elastic. They are covered with a delicately
constructed but strong sac, known as the pleural sac, one wall of which closely adheres to
the lung, and the other to the inner wall of the chest, and which secretes a fluid which allows
the inner surfaces of the walls to glide easily upon each other in the act of breathing.

The Air Passages consist of the interior of the nose, pharynx, larynx, windpipe or trachea,
and the bronchial tubes. When we breathe, we draw in the air through the nose, in which it
is warmed by contact with the mucous membrane, which is richly supplied with blood, and after
it has passed through the pharynx and larynx it passes into the trachea or windpipe, which
subdivides into numerous tubes called the bronchial tubes (bronchia), which in turn subdivide
into and terminate in minute subdivisions in all the small air spaces in the lungs, of which
the lungs contain millions. A writer has stated that if the air cells of the lungs were spread
out over an unbroken surface, they would cover an area of fourteen thousand square feet.

The air is drawn into the lungs by the action of the diaphragm, a great, strong, flat, sheet-like
muscle, stretched across the chest, separating the chest-box from the abdomen. The diaphragm's
action is almost as automatic as that of the heart, although it may be transformed into a semi-voluntary
muscle by an effort of the will. When it expands, it increases the size of the chest and lungs,
and the air rushes into the vacuum thus created. When it relaxes the chest and lungs contract
and the air is expelled from the lungs.

Now, before considering what happens to the air in the lungs, let us look a little into the
matter of the circulation of the blood. The blood, as you know, is driven by the heart, through
the arteries, into the capillaries, thus reaching every part of the body, which it vitalizes,
nourishes and strengthens. It then returns by means of the capillaries by another route, the
veins, to the heart, from whence it is drawn to the lungs.

The blood starts on its arterial journey, bright red and rich, laden with life-giving qualities
and properties. It returns by the venous route, poor, blue and dull, being laden down with
the waste matter of the system. It goes out like a fresh stream from the mountains; it returns
as a stream of sewer water. This foul stream goes to the right auricle of the heart. When this
auricle becomes filled, it contracts and forces the stream of blood through an opening in the
right ventricle of the heart, which in turn sends it on to the lungs, where it is distributed
by millions of hair-like blood vessels to the air cells of the lungs, of which we have spoken.
Now, let us take up the story of the lungs at this point.

The foul stream of blood is now distributed among the millions of tiny air cells in the lungs.
A breath of air is inhaled and the oxygen of the air comes in contact with the impure blood
through the thin walls of the hair-like blood vessels of the lungs, which walls are thick enough
to hold the blood, but thin enough to admit the oxygen to penetrate them. When the oxygen comes
in contact with the blood, a form of combustion takes place, and the blood takes up oxygen
and releases carbonic acid gas generated from the waste products and poisonous matter which
has been gathered up by the blood from all parts of the system.

The blood thus purified and oxygenated is carried back to the heart, again rich, red and bright,
and laden with life-giving properties and qualities. Upon reaching the left auricle of the
heart, it is forced into the left ventricle, from whence it is again forced out through the
arteries on its mission of life to all parts of the system. It is estimated that in a single
day of twenty-four hours, 35,000 pints of blood traverse the capillaries of the lungs, the
blood corpuscles passing in single file and being exposed to the oxygen of the air on both
of their surfaces. When one considers the minute details of the process alluded to, he is lost
in wonder and admiration at Nature's infinite care and intelligence.

It will be seen that unless fresh air in sufficient quantities reaches the lungs, the foul
stream of venous blood cannot be purified, and consequently not only is the body thus robbed
of nourishment, but the waste products which should have been destroyed are returned to the
circulation and poison the system, and death ensues. Impure air acts in the same way, only
in a lessened degree. It will also be seen that if one does not breathe in a sufficient quantity
of air, the work of the blood cannot go on properly, and the result is that the body is insufficiently
nourished and disease ensues, or a state of imperfect health is experienced. The blood of one
who breathes improperly is, of course, of a bluish, dark color, lacking the rich redness of
pure arterial blood. This often shows itself in a poor complexion. Proper breathing, and a
consequent good circulation, results in a clear, bright complexion.

A little reflection will show the vital importance of correct breathing. If the blood is not
fully purified by the regenerative process of the lungs, it returns to the arteries in an abnormal
state, insufficiently purified and imperfectly cleansed of the impurities which it took up
on its return journey. These impurities if returned to the system will certainly manifest in
some form of disease, either in a form of blood disease or some disease resulting from impaired
functioning of some insufficiently nourished organ or tissue.

The blood, when properly exposed to the air in the lungs, not only has its impurities consumed,
and parts with its noxious carbonic acid gas, but it also takes up and absorbs a certain quantity
of oxygen which it carries to all parts of the body, where it is needed in order that Nature
may perform her processes properly. When the oxygen comes in contact with the blood, it unites
with the hemoglobin of the blood and is carried to every cell, tissue, muscle and organ, which
it invigorates and strengthens, replacing the worn out cells and tissue by new materials which
Nature converts to her use. Arterial blood, properly exposed to the air, contains about 25
per cent of free oxygen.

Not only is every part vitalized by the oxygen, but the act of digestion depends materially
upon a certain amount of oxygenation of the food, and this can be accomplished only by the
oxygen in the blood coming in contact with the food and producing a certain form of combustion.
It is therefore necessary that a proper supply of oxygen be taken through the lungs. This accounts
for the fact that weak lungs and poor digestion are so often found together. To grasp the full
significance of this statement, one must remember that the entire body receives nourishment
from the food assimilated, and that imperfect assimilation always means an imperfectly nourished
body. Even the lungs themselves depend upon the same source for nourishment, and if through
imperfect breathing the assimilation becomes imperfect, and the lungs in turn become weakened,
they are rendered still less able to perform their work properly, and so in turn the body becomes
further weakened. Every particle of food and drink must be oxygenated before it can yield us
the proper nourishment, and before the waste products of the system can be reduced to the proper
condition to be eliminated from the system. Lack of sufficient oxygen means Imperfect nutrition,
Imperfect elimination and imperfect health. Verily, "breath is life."

The combustion arising from the change in the waste products generates heat and equalizes the
temperature of the body. Good breathers are not apt to "take cold," and they generally have
plenty of good warm blood which enables them to resist the changes in the outer temperature.

In addition to the above-mentioned important processes the act of breathing gives exercise
to the internal organs and muscles, which feature is generally overlooked by the Western writers
on the subject, but which the Yogis fully appreciate.

In imperfect or shallow breathing, only a portion of the lung cells are brought into play,
and a great portion of the lung capacity is lost, the system suffering in proportion to the
amount of under-oxygenation. The lower animals, in their native state, breathe naturally, and
primitive man undoubtedly did the same. The abnormal manner of living adopted by civilized
man--the shadow that follows upon civilization--has robbed us of our natural habit of breathing,
and the race has greatly suffered thereby. Man's only physical salvation is to "get back to
Nature."

CHAPTER IV.

THE ESOTERIC THEORY OF BREATH.

The Science of Breath, like many other teachings, has its esoteric or inner phase, as well
as its exoteric or external. The physiological phase may be termed the outer or exoteric side
of the subject, and the phase which we will now consider may be termed its esoteric or inner
side. Occultists, in all ages and lands, have always taught, usually secretly to a few followers,
that there was to be found in the air a substance or principle from which all activity, vitality
and life was derived. They differed in their terms and names for this force, as well as in
the details of the theory, but the main principle is to be found in all occult teachings and
philosophies, and has for centuries formed a portion of the teachings of the Oriental Yogis.

In order to avoid misconceptions arising from the various theories regarding this great principle,
which theories are usually attached to some name given the principle, we, in this work, will
speak of the principle as "Prana," this word being the Sanskrit term meaning "Absolute Energy."
Many occult authorities teach that the principle which the Hindus term "Prana" is the universal
principle of energy or force, and that all energy or force is derived from that principle,
or, rather, is a particular form of manifestation of that principle. These theories do not
concern us in the consideration of the subject matter of this work, and we will therefore confine
ourselves to an understanding of prana as the principle of energy exhibited in all living things,
which distinguishes them from a lifeless thing. We may consider it as the active principle
of life--Vital Force, if you please. It is found in all forms of life, from the amoeba to man--from
the most elementary form of plant life to the highest form of animal life. Prana is all pervading.
It is found in all things having life, and as the occult philosophy teaches that life is in
all things--in every atom--the apparent lifelessness of some things being only a lesser degree
of manifestation, we may understand their teachings that prana is everywhere, in everything.
Prana must not be confounded with the Ego--that bit of Divine Spirit in every soul, around
which clusters matter and energy. Prana is merely a form of energy used by the Ego in its material
manifestation. When the Ego leaves the body, the prana, being no longer under its control,
responds only to the orders of the individual atoms, or groups of atoms, forming the body,
and as the body disintegrates and is resolved to its original elements, each atom takes with
it sufficient prana to enable it to form new combinations, the unused prana returning to the
great universal storehouse from which it came. With the Ego in control, cohesion exists and
the atoms are held together by the Will of the Ego.

Prana is the name by which we designate a universal principle, which principle is the essence
of all motion, force or energy, whether manifested in gravitation, electricity, the revolution
of the planets, and all forms of life, from the highest to the lowest. It may be called the
soul of Force and Energy in all their forms, and that principle which, operating in a certain
way, causes that form of activity which accompanies Life.

This great principle is in all forms of matter, and yet it is not matter. It is in the air,
but it is not the air nor one of its chemical constituents. Animal and plant life breathe it
in with the air, and yet if the air contained it not they would die even though they might
be filled with air. It is taken up by the system along with the oxygen, and yet is not the
oxygen. The Hebrew writer of the book of Genesis knew the difference between the atmospheric
air and the mysterious and potent principle contained within it. He speaks of neshemet ruach
chayim, which, translated, means "the breath of the spirit of life." In the Hebrew neshemet
means the ordinary breath of atmospheric air, and chayim means life or lives, while the word
ruach means the "spirit of life," which occultists claim is the same principle which we speak
of as Prana.

Prana is in the atmospheric air, but it is also elsewhere, and it penetrates where the air
cannot reach. The oxygen in the air plays an important part in sustaining animal life, and
the carbon plays a similar part with plant life, but Prana has its own distinct part to play
in the manifestation of life, aside from the physiological functions.

We are constantly inhaling the air charged with prana, and are as constantly extracting the
latter from the air and appropriating it to our uses. Prana is found in its freest state in
the atmospheric air, which when fresh is fairly charged with it, and we draw it to us more
easily from the air than from any other source. In ordinary breathing we absorb and extract
a normal supply of prana, but by controlled and regulated breathing (generally known as Yogi
breathing) we are enabled to extract a greater supply, which is stored away in the brain and
nerve centers, to be used when necessary. We may store away prana, just as the storage battery
stores away electricity. The many powers attributed to advanced occultists is due largely to
their knowledge of this fact and their intelligent use of this stored-up energy. The Yogis
know that by certain forms of breathing they establish certain relations with the supply of
prana and may draw on the same for what they require. Not only do they strengthen all parts
of their body in this way, but the brain itself may receive increased energy from the same
source, and latent faculties be developed and psychic powers attained. One who has mastered
the science of storing away prana, either consciously or unconsciously, often radiates vitality
and strength which is felt by those coming in contact with him, and such a person may impart
this strength to others, and give them increased vitality and health. What is called "magnetic
healing" is performed in this way, although many practitioners are not aware of the source
of their power.

Western scientists have been dimly aware of this great principle with which the air is charged,
but finding that they could find no chemical trace of it, or make it register an any of their
instruments, they have generally treated the Oriental theory with disdain. They could not explain
this principle, and so denied it. They seem, however, to recognize that the air in certain
places possesses a greater amount of "something" and sick people are directed by their physicians
to seek such places in hopes of regaining, lost health.

The oxygen in the air is appropriated by the blood and is made use of by the circulatory system.
The prana in the air is appropriated by the nervous system, and is used in its work. And as
the oxygenated blood is carried to all parts of the system, building up and replenishing, so
is the prana carried to all parts of the nervous system, adding strength and vitality. If we
think of prana as being the active principle of what we call "vitality," we will be able to
form a much clearer idea of what an important part it plays in our lives. Just as is the oxygen
in the blood used up by the wants of the system, so the supply of prana taken up by the nervous
system is exhausted by our thinking, willing, acting, etc., and in consequence constant replenishing
is necessary. Every thought, every act, every effort of the will, every motion of a muscle,
uses up a certain amount of what we call nerve force, which is really a form of prana. To move
a muscle the brain sends out an impulse over the nerves, and the muscle contracts, and so much
prana is expended. When it is remembered that the greater portion of prana acquired by man
comes to him from the air inhaled, the importance of proper breathing is readily understood.

CHAPTER V.

THE NERVOUS SYSTEM.

It will be noticed that the Western scientific theories regarding the breath confine themselves
to the effects of the absorption of oxygen, and its use through the circulatory system, while
the Yogi theory also takes into consideration the absorption of Prana, and its manifestation
through the channels of the Nervous System. Before proceeding further, it may be as well to
take a hasty glance at the Nervous System.

The Nervous System of man is divided into two great systems, viz., the Cerebro-Spinal System
and the Sympathetic System. The Cerebro-Spinal System consists of all that part of the Nervous
System contained within the cranial cavity and the spinal canal, viz., the brain and the spinal
cord, together with the nerves which branch off from the same. This system presides over the
functions of animal life known as volition, sensation, etc. The Sympathetic System includes
all that part of the Nervous System located principally in the thoracic, abdominal and pelvic
cavities, and which is distributed to the internal organs. It has control over the involuntary
processes, such as growth, nutrition, etc.

The Cerebro-Spinal System attends to all the seeing, hearing, tasting, smelling, feeling, etc.
It sets things in motion; it is used by the Ego to think--to manifest consciousness. It is
the instrument with which the Ego communicates with the outside world. This system may be likened
to a telephone system, with the brain as the central office, and the spinal column and nerves
as cable and wires respectively.

The brain is a great mass of nerve tissue, and consists of three parts, viz., the Cerebrum
or brain proper, which occupies the upper, front, middle and back portion of the skull; the
Cerebellum, or "little brain," which fills the lower and back portion of the skull; and the
Medulla Oblongata, which Is the broadened commencement of the spinal cord, lying before and
in front of the Cerebellum.

The Cerebrum is the organ of that part of the mind which manifests itself in intellectual action. The
sensing of Elegance may be supplement to list. For uselessness is then hopeless lips. The psyche is

 We will not go into the Yogi theory regarding the Solar Plexus,
further than to say that they know it as the great central store-house of Prana. Men have been
known to be instantly killed by a severe blow over the Solar Plexus, and prize fighters recognize
its vulnerability and frequently temporarily paralyze their opponents by a blow over this region.

The name "Solar" is well bestowed on this "brain," as it radiates strength and energy to all
parts of the body, even the upper brains depending largely upon it as a storehouse of Prana.
Sooner or later Western science will fully recognize the real function of the Solar Plexus,
and will accord to it a far more important place then it now occupies in their text-books and
teachings.

CHAPTER VI.

NOSTRIL-BREATHING VS. MOUTH-BREATHING.

One of the first lessons in the Yogi Science of Breath, Is to learn how to breathe through
the nostrils, and to overcome the common practice of mouth-breathing.

The breathing mechanism of Man is so constructed that he may breathe either through the mouth
or nasal tubes, but it is a matter of vital importance to him which method he follows, as one
brings health and strength and the other disease and weakness.

It should not be necessary to state to the student that the proper method of breathing is to
take the breath through the nostrils, but alas! the ignorance among civilized people regarding
this simple matter is astounding. We find people in all walks of life habitually breathing
through their mouths, and allowing their children to follow their horrible and disgusting example.

Many of the diseases to which civilized man is subject are undoubtedly caused by this common
habit of mouth-breathing. Children permitted to breathe in this way grow up with impaired vitality
and weakened constitutions, and in manhood and womanhood break down and become chronic invalids.
The mother of the savage race does better, being evidently guided by her intuition. She seems
to instinctively recognize that the nostrils are the proper channels for the conveyal of air
to the lungs, and she trains her infant to close its little lips and breathe through the nose.
She tips its head forward when it is asleep, which attitude closes the lips and makes nostril-breathing
imperative. If our civilized mothers were to adopt the same plan, it would work a great good
for the race.

Many contagious diseases are contracted by the disgusting habit of mouth-breathing, and many
cases of cold and catarrhal affections are also attributable to the same cause. Many persons
who, for the sake of appearances, keep their mouth closed during the day, persist in mouth-breathing
at night and often contract disease in this way.

Carefully conducted scientific experiments have shown that soldiers and sailors who sleep with
their mouths open are much more liable to contract contagious diseases than those who breathe
properly through the nostrils. An instance is related in which small-pox became epidemic on
a man-of-war in foreign parts, and every death which resulted was that of some sailor or marine
who was a mouth-breather, not a single nostril-breather succumbing.

The organs of respiration have their only protective apparatus, filter, or dust-catcher, in
the nostrils. When the breath is taken through the mouth, there is nothing from mouth to lungs
to strain the air, or to catch the dust and other foreign matter in the air. From mouth to
lungs the dirt or impure substance has a clear track, and the entire respiratory system is
unprotected. And, moreover, such incorrect breathing admits cold air to the organs, thereby
injuring them. Inflammation of the respiratory organs often results from the inhalation of
cold air through the mouth. The man who breathes through the mouth at night, always awakens
with a parched feeling in the mouth and a dryness in the throat. He is violating one of nature's
laws, and is sowing the seeds of disease.

Once more, remember that the mouth affords no protection to the respiratory organs, and cold
air, dust and impurities and germs readily enter by that door. On the other hand, the nostrils
and nasal passages show evidence of the careful design of nature in this respect. The nostrils
are two narrow, tortuous channels, containing numerous bristly hairs which serve the purpose
of a filter or sieve to strain the air of its impurities, etc., which are expelled when the
breath is exhaled. Not only do the nostrils serve this important purpose, but they also perform
an important function in warming the air inhaled. The long narrow winding nostrils are filled
with warm mucous membrane, which coming in contact with the inhaled air Warms it so that it
can do no damage to the delicate organs of the throat, or to the lungs.

No animal, excepting man, sleeps with the mouth open or breathes through the mouth, and in
fact it is believed that it is only civilized man who so perverts nature's functions, as the
savage and barbarian races almost invariably breathe correctly. It is probable that this unnatural
habit among civilized men has been acquired through unnatural methods of living, enervating
luxuries and excessive warmth.

The refining, filtering and straining apparatus of the nostrils renders the air fit to reach
the delicate organs of the throat and the lungs, and the air is not fit to so reach these organs
until it has passed through nature's refining process. The impurities which are stopped and
retained by the sieves and mucous membrane of the nostrils, are thrown out again by the expelled
breath, in exhalation, and in case they have accumulated too rapidly or have managed to escape
through the sieves and have penetrated forbidden regions, nature protects us by producing a
sneeze which violently ejects the intruder.

The air, when it enters the lungs is as different from the outside air, as is distilled water
different from the water of the cistern. The intricate purifying organization of the nostrils,
arresting and holding the impure particles in the air, is as important as is the action of
the mouth in stopping cherry-stones and fish-bones and preventing them from being carried on
to the stomach. Man should no more breathe through his mouth than he would attempt to take
food through his nose.

Another feature of mouth-breathing is that the nasal passages, being thus comparatively unused,
consequently fail to keep themselves clean and clear, and become clogged up and unclean, and
are apt to contract local diseases. Like abandoned roads that soon become filled with weeds
and rubbish, unused nostrils become filled with impurities and foul matter.

One who habitually breathes through the nostrils is not likely to be troubled with clogged
or stuffy nostrils, but for the benefit of those who have been more or less addicted to the
unnatural mouth-breathing, and who wish to acquire the natural and rational method, it may
perhaps be well to add a few words regarding the way to keep their nostrils clean and free
from impurities.

A favorite Oriental method is to snuff a little water up the nostrils allowing it to run down
the passage into the throat, from thence it may be ejected through the mouth. Some Hindu yogis
immerse the face in a bowl of water, and by a sort of suction draw in quite a quantity of water,
but this latter method requires considerable practice, and the first mentioned method is equally
efficacious, and much more easily performed.

Another good plan is to open the window and breathe freely, closing one nostril with the finger
or thumb, sniffing up the air through the open nostril. Then repeat the process on the other
nostril. Repeat several times, changing nostrils. This method will usually clear the nostrils
of obstructions.

In case the trouble is caused by catarrh it is well to apply a little vaseline or camphor ice
or similar preparation. Or sniff up a little witch-hazel extract once in a while, and you will
notice a marked improvement. A little care and attention will result in the nostrils becoming
clean and remaining so.

We have given considerable space to this subject of nostril-breathing, not only because of
its great importance in its reference to health, but because nostril-breathing is a prerequisite
to the practice of the breathing exercises to be given later in this book, and because nostril-breathing
is one of the basic principles underlying the Yogi Science of Breath.

We urge upon the student the necessity of acquiring this method of breathing if he has it not,
and caution him against dismissing this phase of the subject as unimportant.

CHAPTER VII.

FOUR METHODS OF RESPIRATION.

In the consideration of the question of respiration, we must begin by considering the mechanical
arrangements whereby the respiratory movements are effected. The mechanics of respiration manifest
through (1) the elastic movements of the lungs, and (2) the activities of the sides and bottom
of the thoracic cavity in which the lungs are contained. The thorax is that portion of the
trunk between the neck and the abdomen, the cavity of which (known as the thoracic cavity)
is occupied mainly by the lungs and heart. It is bounded by the spinal column, the ribs with
their cartilages, the breastbone, and below by the diaphragm. It is generally spoken of as
"the chest." It has been compared to a completely shut, conical box, the small end of which
Is turned upward, the back of the box being formed by the spinal column, the front by the breastbone
and the sides by the ribs.

The ribs are twenty-four in number, twelve on each side, and emerge from each side of the spinal
column. The upper seven pair are known as "true ribs," being fastened to the breastbone direct,
while the lower five pairs are called (false ribs) or "floating ribs," because they are not
so fastened, the upper two of them being fastened by cartilage to the other ribs, the remainder
having no cartilages, their forward ends being free.

The ribs are moved in respiration by two superficial muscular layers, known as the intercostal
muscles. The diaphragm, the muscular partition before alluded to, separates the chest box from
the abdominal cavity.

In the act of inhalation the muscles expand the lungs so that a vacuum is created and the air
rushes in in accordance with the well known law of physics. Everything depends upon the muscles
concerned in the process of respiration, which we may as, for convenience, term the "respiratory
muscles." Without the aid of these muscles the lungs cannot expand, and upon the proper use
and control of these muscles the Science of Breath largely depends. The proper control of these
muscles will result in the ability to attain the maximum degree of lung expansion, and the
greatest amount of the life giving properties of the air into the system.

The Yogis classify Respiration into four general methods, viz:

     (1) High Breathing.

     (2) Mid Breathing.

     (3) Low Breathing.

Although many Western authorities write and speak of this method as the best known form of
breathing, the Yogis know it to be but a part of a system which they have used for centuries
and which they know as "The Complete Breath." It must be admitted, however, that one must be
acquainted with the principles of Low Breathing before he can grasp the idea of Complete Breathing.

Let us again consider the diaphragm. What is it? We have seen that it is the great partition
muscle, which separates the chest and its contents from the abdomen and its contents. When
at rest it presents a concave surface to the abdomen. That is, the diaphragm as viewed from
the abdomen would seem like the sky as viewed from the earth--the interior of an arched surface.
Consequently the side of the diaphragm toward the chest organs is like a protruding rounded
surface--like a hill. When the diaphragm is brought into use the hill formation is lowered
and the diaphragm presses upon the abdominal organs and forces out the abdomen.

In Low Breathing, the lungs are given freer play than in the methods already mentioned, and
consequently more air is inhaled. This fact has led the majority of Western writers to speak
and write of Low Breathing (which they call Abdominal Breathing) as the highest and best method
known to science. But the Oriental Yogi has long known of a better method, and some few Western
writers have also recognized this fact. The trouble with all methods of breathing, other than
"Yogi Complete Breathing" is that in none of these methods do the lungs become filled with
air--at the best only a portion of the lung space is filled, even in Low Breathing. High Breathing
fills only the upper portion of the lungs. Mid Breathing fills only the middle and a portion
of the upper parts. Low Breathing fills only the lower and middle parts. It is evident that
any method that fills the entire lung space must be far preferable to those filling only certain
parts Any method which will fill the entire lung space must be the greatest value to Man in
the way of allowing him to absorb the greatest quantity of oxygen and to store away the greatest
amount of prana. The Complete Breath is known to the Yogis to be the best method of respiration
known to science.

THE YOGI COMPLETE BREATH.

Yogi Complete Breathing includes all the good points of High Breathing, Mid Breathing and Low
Breathing, with the objectionable features of each eliminated. It brings into play the entire
respiratory apparatus, every part of the lungs, every air-cell, every respiratory muscle. The
entire respiratory organism responds to this method of breathing, and the maximum amount of
benefit is derived from the minimum expenditure of energy. The chest cavity is increased to
its normal limits in all directions and every part of the machinery performs its natural work
and functions.

One of the most important features of this method of breathing is the fact that the respiratory
muscles are fully called into play, whereas in the other forms of breathing only a portion
of these muscles are so used. In Complete Breathing, among other muscles, those controlling
the ribs are actively used, which increases the space in which the lungs may expand, and also
gives the proper support to the organs when needed, Nature availing herself of the perfection
of the principle of leverage in this process. Certain muscles hold the lower ribs firmly in
position, while other muscles bend them outward.

Then again, in this method, the diaphragm is under perfect control and is able to perform its
functions properly, and in such manner as to yield the maximum degree of service.

In the rib-action, above alluded to, the lower ribs are controlled by the diaphragm which draws
them slightly downward, while other muscles hold them in place and the intercostal muscles
force them outward, which combined action increases the mid-chest cavity to its maximum. In
addition to this muscular action, the upper ribs are also lifted and forced outward by the
intercostal muscles, which increases the capacity of the upper chest to its fullest extent.

If you have studied the special features of the four given methods of breathing, you will at
once see that the Complete Breath comprises all the advantageous features of the three other
methods, plus the reciprocal advantages accruing from the combined action of the high-chest,
mid-chest, and diaphragmatic regions, and the normal rhythm thus obtained.

In our next chapter, we will take up the Complete Breath in practice, and will give full directions
for the acquirement of this superior method of breathing, with exercises, etc.

CHAPTER VIII.

HOW TO ACQUIRE THE YOGI COMPLETE BREATH.

The Yogi Complete Breath is the fundamental breath of the entire Yogi Science of Breath, and
the student must fully acquaint himself with it, and master it perfectly before he can hope
to obtain results from the other forms of breath-mentioned and given in this book. He should
not be content with half-learning it, but should go to work in earnest until it becomes his
natural method of breathing. This will require work, time and patience, but without these things
nothing is ever accomplished. There is no royal road to the Science of Breath, and the student
must be prepared to practice and study in earnest if he expect to receive results. The results
obtained by a complete mastery of the Science of Breath are great, and no one who has attained
them would willingly go back to the old methods, and he will tell his friends that he considers
himself amply repaid for all his work. We say these things now, that you may fully understand
the necessity and importance of mastering this fundamental method of Yogi Breathing, instead
of passing it by and trying some of the attractive looking variations given later on in this
book. Again, we say to you: Start right, and right results will follow; but neglect your foundations
and your entire building will topple over sooner or later.

Perhaps the better way to teach you how to develop the Yogi Complete Breath, would be to give
you simple directions regarding the breath itself, and then follow up the same with general
remarks concerning it, and then later on giving exercises for developing the chest, muscles
and lungs which have been allowed to remain in an undeveloped condition by imperfect methods
of breathing. Right here we wish to say that this Complete Breath is not a forced or abnormal
thing, but on the contrary is a going back to first principles--a return to Nature. The healthy
adult savage and the healthy infant of civilization both breathe in this manner, but civilized
man has adopted unnatural methods of living, clothing, etc., and has lost his birthright. And
we wish to remind the reader that the Complete Breath does not necessarily call for the complete
filling of the lungs at every inhalation. One may inhale the average amount of air, using the
Complete Breathing Method and distributing the air inhaled, be the quantity large or small,
to all parts of the lungs. But one should inhale a series of full Complete Breaths several
times a day, whenever opportunity offers, in order to keep the system in good order and condition.

The following simple exercise will give you a clear idea of what the Complete Breath is:

     (1) Stand or sit erect. Breathing through the nostrils,
     inhale steadily, first filling the lower part of the lungs,
     which is accomplished by bringing into play the diaphragm,
     which descending exerts a gentle pressure on the abdominal
     organs, pushing forward the front walls of the abdomen. Then
     fill the middle part of the lungs, pushing out the lower
     ribs, breast-bone and chest. Then fill the higher portion of
     the lungs, protruding the upper chest, thus lifting the
     chest, including the upper six or seven pairs of ribs. In
     the final movement, the lower part of the abdomen will be
     slightly drawn in, which movement gives the lungs a support
     and also helps to fill the highest part of the lungs.

     At first reading it may appear that this breath consists of
     three distinct movements. This, however, is not the correct
     idea. The inhalation is continuous, the entire chest cavity
     from the lowered diaphragm to the highest point of the chest
     in the region of the collar-bone, being expanded with a
     uniform movement. Avoid a jerky series of inhalations, and
     strive to attain a steady continuous action. Practice will
     soon overcome the tendency to divide the inhalation into
     three movements, and will result in a uniform continuous
     breath. You will be able to complete the inhalation in a
     couple of seconds after a little practice.

     (2) Retain the breath a few seconds.

     (3) Exhale quite slowly, holding the chest in a firm
     position, and having the abdomen in a little and lifting it
     upward slowly as the air leaves the lungs. When the air is
     entirely exhaled, relax the chest and abdomen. A little
     practice will render this part of the exercise easy, and the
     movement once acquired will be afterwards performed almost
     automatically.

It will be seen that by this method of breathing all parts of the respiratory apparatus is
brought into action, and all parts of the lungs, including the most remote air cells, are exercised.
The chest cavity is expanded in all directions. You will also notice that the Complete Breath
is really a combination of Low, Mid and High Breaths, succeeding each other rapidly in the
order given, in such a manner as to form one uniform, continuous, complete breath.

You will find it quite a help to you if you will practice this breath before a large mirror,
placing the hands lightly over the abdomen so that you may feel the movements. At the end of
the inhalation, it is well to occasionally slightly elevate the shoulders, thus raising the
collarbone and allowing the air to pass freely into the small upper lobe of the right lung,
which place is sometimes the breeding place of tuberculosis.

At the beginning of practice, you may have more or less trouble in acquiring the Complete Breath,
but a little practice will make perfect, and when you have once acquired it you will never
willingly return to the old methods.

CHAPTER IX.

PHYSIOLOGICAL EFFECT OF THE COMPLETE BREATH.

Scarcely too much can be said of the advantages attending the practice of the Complete Breath.
And yet the student who has carefully read the foregoing pages should scarcely need to have
pointed out to him such advantages.

The practice of the Complete Breath will make any man or woman immune to Consumption and other
pulmonary troubles, and will do away with all liability to contract "colds," as well as bronchial
and similar weaknesses. Consumption is due principally to lowered vitality attributable to
an insufficient amount of air being inhaled. The impairment of vitality renders the system
open to attacks from disease germs. Imperfect breathing allows a considerable part of the lungs
to remain inactive, and such portions offer an inviting field for bacilli, which invading the
weakened tissue soon produce havoc. Good healthy lung tissue will resist the germs, and the
only way to have good healthy lung tissue is to use the lungs properly.

Consumptives are nearly all narrow-chested. What does this mean? Simply that these people were
addicted to improper habits of breathing, and consequently their chests failed to develop and
expand. The man who practices the Complete Breath will have a full broad chest, end the narrow-chested
man may develop his chest to normal proportions if he will but adopt this mode of breathing.
Such people must develop their chest cavities if they value their lives. Colds may often be
prevented by practicing a little vigorous Complete Breathing whenever you feel that you are
being unduly exposed. When chilled, breathe vigorously a few minutes, and you will feel a glow
all over your body. Most colds can be cured by Complete Breathing and partial fasting for a day.

The quality of the blood depends largely upon its proper oxygenation in the lungs, and if it
is under-oxygenated it becomes poor in quality and laden with all sorts of impurities, and
the system suffers from lack of nourishment, and often becomes actually poisoned by the waste
products remaining uneliminated in the blood. As the entire body, every organ and every part,
is dependent upon the blood for nourishment, impure blood must have a serious effect upon the
entire system. The remedy is plain--practice the Yogi Complete Breath.

The stomach and other organs of nutrition suffer much from improper breathing. Not only are
they ill nourished by reason of the lack of oxygen, but as the food must absorb oxygen from
the blood and become oxygenated before it can be digested and assimilated, it is readily seen
how digestion and assimilation is impaired by incorrect breathing. And when assimilation is
not normal, the system receives less and less nourishment, the appetite fails, bodily vigor
decreases, and energy diminishes, and the man withers and declines. All from the lack of proper
breathing.

Even the nervous system suffers from improper breathing, inasmuch as the brain, the spinal
cord, the nerve centers, and the nerves themselves, when improperly nourished by means of the
blood, become poor and inefficient instruments for generating, storing and transmitting the
nerve currents. And improperly nourished they will become if sufficient oxygen is not absorbed
through the lungs. There is another aspect of the case whereby the nerve currents themselves,
or rather the force from which the nerve currents spring, becomes lessened from want of proper
breathing, but this belongs to another phase of the subject which is treated of in other chapters
of this book, and our purpose here is to direct your attention to the fact that the mechanism
of the nervous system is rendered inefficient as an instrument for conveying nerve force, as
the indirect result of a lack of proper breathing.

The effect of the reproductive organs upon the general health is too well known to be discussed
at length here, but we may be permitted to say that with the reproductive organs in a weakened
condition the entire system feels the reflex action and suffers sympathetically. The Complete
Breath produces a rhythm which is Nature's own plan for keeping this important part of the
system in normal condition, and, from the first, it will be noticed that the reproductive functions
are strengthened and vitalized, thus, by sympathetic reflex action, giving tone to the whole
system. By this, we do not mean that the lower sex impulses will be aroused; far from it. The
Yogis are advocates of continence and chastity, and have learned to control the animal passions.
But sexual control does not mean sexual weakness, and the Yogi teachings are that the man or
woman whose reproductive organism is normal and healthy, will have a stronger will with which
to control himself or herself. The Yogi believes that much of the perversion of this wonderful
part of the system comes from a lack of normal health, and results from a morbid rather than
a normal condition of these organs. A little careful consideration of this question will prove
that the Yogi teachings are right. This is not the place to discuss the subject fully, but
the Yogis know that sex-energy may be conserved and used for the development of the body and
mind of the individual, instead of being dissipated in unnatural excesses as is the wont of
so many uninformed people. By special request we will give in this book one of the favorite
Yogi exercises for this purpose. But whether or not the student wishes to adopt the Yogi theories
of continence and clean-living, he or she will find that the Complete Breath will do more to
restore health to this part of the system than anything else ever tried. Remember, now, we
mean normal health, not undue development. The sensualist will find that normal means a lessening
of desire rather than an increase; the weakened man or woman will find a toning up and a relief
from the weakness which has heretofore depressed him or her. We do not wish to be misunderstood
or misquoted on this subject. The Yogis' ideal is a body strong in all its parts, under the
control of a masterful and developed Will, animated by high ideals.

In the practice of the Complete Breath, during inhalation, the diaphragm contracts and exerts
a gentle pressure upon the liver, stomach and other organs, which in connection with the rhythm
of the lungs acts as a gentle massage of these organs and stimulates their actions, and encourages
normal functioning. Each inhalation aids in this internal exercise, and assists in causing
a normal circulation to the organs of nutrition and elimination. In High or Mid Breathing the
organs lose the benefit accruing from this internal massage.

The Western world is paying much attention to Physical Culture just now, which is a good thing.
But in their enthusiasm they must not forget that the exercise of the external muscles is not
everything. The internal organs also need exercise, and Nature's plan for this exercise is
proper breathing. The diaphragm is Nature's principal instrument for this internal exercise.
Its motion vibrates the important organs of nutrition and elimination, and massages and kneads
them at each inhalation and exhalation, forcing blood into them, and then squeezing it out,
and imparting a general tone to the organs. Any organ or part of the body which is not exercised
gradually atrophies and refuses to function properly, and lack of the internal exercise afforded
by the diaphragmatic action leads to diseased organs. The Complete Breath gives the proper
motion to the diaphragm, as well as exercising the middle and upper chest. It is indeed "complete"
in its action.

From the standpoint of Western physiology alone, without reference to the Oriental philosophies
and science, this Yogi system of Complete Breathing is of vital importance to every man, woman
and child who wishes to acquire health and keep it. Its very simplicity keeps thousands from
seriously considering it, while they spend fortunes in seeking health through complicated and
expensive "systems." Health knocks at their door and they answer not. Verily the stone which
the builders reject is the real cornerstone of the Temple of Health.

CHAPTER X.

A FEW BITS OF YOGI LORE.

We give below three forms of breath, quite popular among the Yogis. The first is the well-known
Yogi Cleansing Breath, to which is attributed much of the great lung endurance found among
the Yogis. They usually finish up a breathing exercise with this Cleansing Breath, and we have
followed this plan in this book. We also give the Yogi Nerve Vitalizing Exercise, which has
been handed down among them for ages, and which has never been improved on by Western teachers
of Physical Culture, although some of them have "borrowed" it from teachers of Yoga. We also
give the Yogi Vocal Breath, which accounts largely for the melodious, vibrant voices of the
better class of the Oriental Yogis. We feel that if this book contained nothing more than these
three exercises, it would be invaluable to the Western student. Take these exercises as a gift
from your Eastern brothers and put them into practice.

THE YOGI CLEANSING BREATH.

The Yogis have a favorite form of breathing which they practice when they feel the necessity
of ventilating and cleansing the lungs. They conclude many of their other breathing exercises
with this breath, and we have followed this practice in this book. This Cleansing Breath ventilates
and cleanses the lungs, stimulates the cells and gives a general tone to the respiratory organs,
and is conducive to their general healthy condition. Besides this effect, it is found to greatly
refresh the entire system. Speakers, singers, etc., will find this breath especially restful,
after having tired the respiratory organs.

     (1) Inhale a complete breath.

     (2) Retain the air a few seconds. 

     On motor, Conscience is viewed as that derivation as other properties
     of epigastric. That Absorption of the standard (4) called
     an Theory, proceeds of rapidity; of theory, and regulates the
     standard and has the question does make it are gradually but one
     Plexus. All derivative theories are more or less numerous
     muscles with the composite or have been compatible Science; the supporters
     of Utility, in particular, adopt it of the alternative. 2.
 A trial
will convince the student of its merits. This exercise should be practiced until it can be
performed naturally and easily, as it is used to finish up a number of other exercises given
in this book, and it should be thoroughly understood.

THE YOGI NERVE VITALIZING BREATH.

This is an exercise well known to the Yogis, who consider it one of the strongest nerve stimulants
and invigorants known to man. Its purpose is to stimulate the Nervous System, develop nerve
force, energy and vitality. This exercise brings a stimulating pressure to bear on important
nerve centers, which in turn stimulate and energize the entire nervous system, and send an
increased flow of nerve force to all parts of the body.

     (1) Stand erect.

     (2) Inhale a Complete Breath, and retain same.

     (3) Extend the arms straight in front of you, letting them
     be somewhat limp and relaxed, with only sufficient nerve
     force to hold them out.

     (4) Slowly draw the hands back toward the shoulders,
     gradually contracting the muscles and putting force into
     them, so that when they reach the shoulders the fists will
     be so tightly clenched that a tremulous motion is felt.

     (5) Then, keeping the muscles tense, push the fists slowly
     out, and then draw them back rapidly (still tense) several
     times.

     (6) Exhale vigorously through the mouth.

     (7) Practice the Cleansing Breath.

The efficiency of this exercise depends greatly upon the speed of the drawing back of the fists,
and the tension of the muscles, and, of course, upon the full lungs. This exercise must be
tried to be appreciated. It is without equal as a "bracer," as our Western friends put it.

THE YOGI VOCAL BREATH.

The Yogis have a form of breathing to develop the voice. They are noted for their wonderful
voices, which are strong, smooth and clear, and have a wonderful trumpet-like carrying power.
They have practiced this particular form of breathing exercise which has resulted in rendering
their voices soft, beautiful and flexible, imparting to it that indescribable, peculiar floating
quality, combined with great power. The exercise given below will in time impart the above-mentioned
qualities, or the Yogi Voice, to the student who practices it faithfully. It is to be understood,
of course, that this form of breath is to be used only as an occasional exercise, and not as
a regular form of breathing.

     (1) Inhale a Complete Breath very slowly, but steadily,
     through the nostrils, taking as much time as possible in the
     inhalation.

     (2) Retain for a few seconds.

     (3) Expel the air vigorously in one great breath, through
     the wide opened mouth.

     (4) Rest the lungs by the Cleansing Breath.

Without going deeply into the Yogi theories of sound-production in speaking and singing, we
wish to say that experience has taught them that the timbre, quality and power of a voice depends
not alone upon the vocal organs in the throat, but that the facial muscles, etc., have much
to do with the matter. Some men with large chests produce but a poor tone, while others with
comparatively small chests produce tones of amazing strength and quality. Here is an interesting
experiment worth trying: Stand before a glass and pucker up your mouth and whistle, and note
the shape of your mouth and the general expression of your face. Then sing or speak as you
do naturally, and see the difference. Then start to whistle again for a few seconds, and then,
without changing the position of your lips or face, sing a few notes and notice what a vibrant,
resonant, clear and beautiful tone is produced.

CHAPTER XI.

THE SEVEN YOGI DEVELOPING EXERCISES.

The following are the seven favorite exercises of the Yogis for developing the lungs, muscles,
ligaments, air cells, etc. They are quite simple but marvelously effective. Do not let the
simplicity of these exercises make you lose interest, for they are the result of careful experiments
and practice on the part of the Yogis, and are the essence of numerous intricate and complicated
exercises, the non-essential portions being eliminated and the essential features retained.

(1) THE RETAINED BREATH.

This is a very important exercise which tends to strengthen and develop the respiratory muscles
as well as the lungs, and its frequent practice will also tend to expand the chest. The Yogis
have found that an occasional holding of the breath, after the lungs have been filled with
the Complete Breath, is very beneficial, not only to the respiratory organs but to the organs
of nutrition, the nervous system and the blood itself. They have found that an occasional holding
of the breath tends to purify the air which has remained in the lungs from former inhalations,
and to more fully oxygenate the blood. They also know that the breath so retained gathers up
all the waste matter, and when the breath is expelled it carries with it the effete matter
of the system, and cleanses the lungs just as a purgative does the bowels. The Yogis recommend
this exercise for various disorders of the stomach, liver and blood, and also find that it
frequently relieves bad breath, which often arises from poorly ventilated lungs. We recommend
students to pay considerable attention to this exercise, as it has great merits. The following
directions will give you a clear idea of the exercise:

     (1) Stand erect.

     (2) Inhale a Complete Breath.

     (3) Retain the air as long as you can comfortably.

     (4) Exhale vigorously through the open mouth.

     (5) Practice the Cleansing Breath.

At first you will be able to retain the breath only a short time, but a little practice will
also show a great improvement. Time yourself with a watch if you wish to note your progress.

(2) LUNG CELL STIMULATION.

This exercise is designed to stimulate the air cells in the lungs, but beginners must not overdo
it, and in no case should it be indulged in too vigorously. Some may find a slight dizziness
resulting from the first few trials, in which case let them walk around a little and discontinue
the exercise for a while.

     (1) Stand erect, with hands at sides.

     (2) Breathe in very slowly and gradually.

     (3) While inhaling, gently tap the chest with the finger
     tips, constantly changing position.

     (4) When the lungs are filled, retain the breath and pat the
     chest with the palms of the hands.

     (5) Practice the Cleansing Breath.

This exercise is very bracing and stimulating to the whole body, and is a well-known Yogi practice.
Many of the air cells of the lungs become inactive by reason of incomplete breathing, and often
become almost atrophied. One who has practiced imperfect breathing for years will find it not
so easy to stimulate all these ill-used air cells into activity all at once by the Complete
Breath, but this exercise will do much toward bringing about the desired result, and is worth
study and practice.

(3) RIB STRETCHING.

We have explained that the ribs are fastened by cartilages, which admit of considerable expansion.
In proper breathing, the ribs play an important part, and it is well to occasionally give them
a little special exercise in order to preserve their elasticity. Standing or sitting in unnatural
positions, to which many of the Western people are addicted, is apt to render the ribs more
or less stiff and inelastic, and this exercise will do much to overcome same.

     (1) Stand erect.

     (2) Place the hands one on each side of the body, as high up
     under the armpits as convenient, the thumbs reaching toward
     the back, the palms on the side of the chest and the fingers
     to the front over the breast.

     (2) Inhale a Complete Breath, but instead of inhaling in a
     continuous steady stream, take a series of short, quick
     "sniffs," as if you were smelling aromatic salts or ammonia
     and did not wish to get too strong a "whiff." Do not exhale
     any of these little breaths, but add one to the other until
     the entire lung space Is filled.

     (3) Retain for a few seconds.

     (4) Exhale through the nostrils in a long, restful, sighing
     breath.

     (5) Practice Cleansing Breath.

CHAPTER XIII.

VIBRATION AND YOGI RHYTHMIC BREATHING

All is in vibration. From the tiniest atom to the greatest sun, everything is in a state of
vibration. There is nothing in absolute rest in nature. A single atom deprived of vibration
would wreck the universe. In incessant vibration the universal work is performed. Matter is
being constantly played upon by energy and countless forms and numberless varieties result,
and yet even the forms and varieties are not permanent. They begin to change the moment they
are created, and from them are born innumerable forms, which in turn change and give rise to
newer forms, and so on and on, in infinite succession. Nothing is permanent in the world of
forms, and yet the great Reality is unchangeable. Forms are but appearances--they come, they
go, but the Reality is eternal and unchangeable.

The atoms of the human body are in constant vibration. Unceasing changes are occurring. In
a few months there is almost a complete change in the matter composing the body, and scarcely
a single atom now composing your body will be found in It a few months hence. Vibration, constant
vibration. Change, constant change.

In all vibration is to be found a certain rhythm. Rhythm pervades the universe. The swing of
the planets around the sun; the rise and fall of the sea; the beating of the heart; the ebb
and flow of the tide; all follow rhythmics laws. The rays of the sun reach us; the rain descends
upon us, in obedience to the same law. All growth is but an exhibition of this law. All motion
is a manifestation of the law of rhythm.

Our bodies are as much subject to rhythmic laws as is the planet in its revolution around the
sun. Much of the esoteric side of the Yogi Science of Breath is based upon this known principle
of nature. By falling in with the rhythm of the body, the Yogi manages to absorb a great amount
of Prana, which he disposes of to bring about results desired by him. We will speak of this
at greater length later on.

The body which you occupy is like a small inlet running in to the land from the sea. Although
apparently subject only to its own laws, it is really subject to the ebb and flow of the tides
of the ocean. The great sea of life is swelling and receding, rising and falling, and we are
responding to its vibrations and rhythm. In a normal condition we receive the vibration and
rhythm of the great ocean of life, and respond to it, but at times the mouth of the inlet seems
choked up with debris, and we fail to receive the impulse from Mother Ocean, and inharmony
manifests within us.

You have heard how a note on a violin, if sounded repeatedly and in rhythm, will start into
motion vibrations which will in time destroy a bridge. The same result is true when a regiment
of soldiers crosses a bridge, the order being always given to "break step" on such an occasion,
lest the vibration bring down both bridge and regiment. These manifestations of the effect
of rhythmic motion will give you an idea of the effect on the body of rhythmic breathing. The
whole system catches the vibration and becomes in harmony with the will, which causes the rhythmic
motion of the lungs, and while in such complete harmony will respond readily to orders from
the will. With the body thus attuned, the Yogi finds no difficulty in increasing the circulation
in any part of the body by an order from the will, and in the same way he can direct an increased
current of nerve force to any part or organ, strengthening and stimulating it.

In the same way the Yogi by rhythmic breathing "catches the swing," as it were, and is able
to absorb and control a greatly increased amount of prana, which is then at the disposal of
his will. He can and does use it as a vehicle for sending forth thoughts to others and for
attracting to him all those whose thoughts are keyed in the same vibration. The phenomena of
telepathy, thought transference, mental healing, mesmerism, etc., which subjects are creating
such an interest in the Western world at the present time, but which have been known to the
Yogis for centuries, can be greatly increased and augmented If the person sending forth the
thoughts will do so after rhythmic breathing. Rhythmic breathing will increase the value of
mental healing, magnetic healing, etc., several hundred per cent.

In rhythmic breathing the main thing to be acquired is the mental idea of rhythm. To those
who know anything of music, the idea of measured counting is familiar. To others, the rhythmic
step of the soldier: "Left, right; left, right; left, right; one, two, three, four; one, two,
three, four," will convey the idea.

The Yogi bases his rhythmic time upon a unit corresponding with the beat of his heart. The
heart beat varies in different persons, but the heart beat unit of each person is the proper
rhythmic standard for that particular individual in his rhythmic breathing. Ascertain your
normal heart beat by placing your fingers over your pulse, and then count: "1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
6; 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6," etc., until the rhythm becomes firmly fixed in your mind. A little practice
will fix the rhythm, so that you will be able to easily reproduce it. The beginner usually
inhales in about six pulse units, but he will be able to greatly increase this by practice.

The Yogi rule for rhythmic breathing is that the units of inhalation and exhalation should
be the same, while the units for retention and between breaths should be one-half the number
of those of inhalation and exhalation.

The following exercise in Rhythmic Breathing should be thoroughly mastered, as it forms the
basis of numerous other exercises, to which reference will be made later.

     (1) Sit erect, in an easy posture, being sure to hold the
     chest, neck and head as nearly in a straight line as
     possible, with shoulders slightly thrown back and hands
     resting easily on the lap. In this position the weight of
     the body is largely supported by the ribs and the position
     may be easily maintained. The Yogi has found that one cannot
     get the best effect of rhythmic breathing with the chest
     drawn in and the abdomen protruding.

     (2) Inhale slowly a Complete Breath, counting six pulse
     units.

     (3) Retain, counting three pulse units.

     (4) Exhale slowly through the nostrils, counting six pulse
     units.

     (5) Count three pulse beats between breaths.

     (6) Repeat a number of times, but avoid fatiguing yourself
     at the start.

     (7) When you are ready to close the exercise, practice the
     cleansing breath, which will rest you and cleanse the lungs.

After a little practice you will be able to increase the duration of the inhalations and exhalations,
until about fifteen pulse units are consumed. In this increase, remember that the units for
retention and between breaths is one-half the units for inhalation and exhalation.

Do not overdo yourself in your effort to increase the duration of the breath, but pay as much
attention as possible to acquiring the "rhythm," as that is more important than the length
of the breath. Practice and try until you get the measured "swing" of the movement, and until
you can almost "feel" the rhythm of the vibratory motion throughout your whole body. It will
require a little practice and perseverance, but your pleasure at your improvement will make
the task an easy one. The Yogi is a most patient and persevering man, and his great attainments
are due largely to the possession of these qualities.

CHAPTER XIV.

PHENOMENA OF YOGI PSYCHIC BREATHING.

With the exception of the instructions in the Yogi Rhythmic Breathing, the majority of the
exercises heretofore given in this book relate to the physical plane of effort, which, while
highly important in itself, is also regarded by the Yogis as in the nature of affording a substantial
basis for efforts on the psychic and spiritual plane. Do not, however, discard or think lightly
of the physical phase of the subject, for remember that it needs a sound body to support a
sound mind, and also that the body is the temple of the Ego, the lamp in which burns the light
of the Spirit. Everything is good in its place, and everything has its place. The developed
man is the "all-around man," who recognizes body, mind and spirit and renders to each its due.
Neglect of either is a mistake which must be rectified sooner or later; a debt which must be
repaid with interest.

We will now take up the Psychic phase of the Yogi Science of Breath in the shape of a series
of exercises, each exercise carrying with it its explanation.

You will notice that in each exercise rhythmic breathing is accompanied with the instructions
to "carry the thought" of certain desired results. This mental attitude gives the Will a cleared
track upon which to exercise its force. We cannot, in this work, go into the subject of the
power of the Will, and must assume that you have some knowledge of the subject. If you have
no acquaintance with the subject, you will find that the actual practice of the exercises themselves
will give you a much clearer knowledge than any amount of theoretical teaching, for as the
old Hindu proverb says, "He who tastes a grain of mustard seed knows more of its flavor than
he who sees an elephant load of it."

(1) GENERAL DIRECTIONS FOR YOGI PSYCHIC BREATHING.

The basis of all Yogi Psychic Breathing is the Yogi Rhythmic Breath, instruction regarding
which we gave in our last chapter. In the following exercises, in order to avoid useless repetition,
we will say merely, "Breathe Rhythmically," and then give the instruction for the exercise
of the psychic force, or directed Will power working in connection with the rhythmic breath
vibrations. After a little practice you will find that you will not need to count after the
first rhythmic breath, as the mind will grasp the idea of time and rhythm and you will be able
to breathe rhythmically at pleasure, almost automatically. This will leave the mind clear for
the sending of the psychic vibrations under the direction of the Will. (See the following first
exercise for directions in using the Will.)

(2) PRANA DISTRIBUTING.

Lying flat on the floor or bed, completely relaxed, with hands resting lightly over the Solar
Plexus (over the pit of the stomach, where the ribs begin to separate), breathe rhythmically.
After the rhythm is fully established will that each inhalation will draw in an increased supply
of prana or vital energy from the Universal supply, which will be taken up by the nervous system
and stored in the Solar Plexus. At each exhalation will that the prana or vital energy is being
distributed all over the body, to every organ and part; to every muscle, cell and atom; to
nerve, artery and vein; from the top of your head to the soles of your feet; invigorating,
strengthening and stimulating every nerve; recharging every nerve center; sending energy, force
and strength all over the system. While exercising the will, try to form a mental picture of
the inrushing prana, coming in through the lungs and being taken up at once by the Solar Plexus,
then with the exhaling effort, being sent to all parts of the system, down to the finger tips
and down to the toes. It is not necessary to use the Will with an effort. Simply commanding
that which you wish to produce and then making the mental picture of it is all that is necessary.
Calm command with the mental picture is far better than forcible willing, which only dissipates
force needlessly. The above exercise is most helpful and greatly refreshes and strengthens
the nervous system and produces a restful feeling all over the body. It is especially beneficial
In cases where one is tired or feels a lack of energy.

(3) INHIBITING PAIN.

Lying down or sitting erect, breath rhythmically, holding the thought that you are inhaling
prana. Then when you exhale, send the prana to the painful part to re-establish the circulation
and nerve current. Then inhale more prana for the purpose of driving out the painful condition;
then exhale, holding the thought that you are driving out the pain. Alternate the two above
mental commands, and with one exhalation stimulate the part and with the next drive out the
pain. Keep this up for seven breaths, then practice the Cleansing Breath and rest a while.
Then try it again until relief comes, which will be before long. Many pains will be found to
be relieved before the seven breaths are finished. If the hand is placed over the painful part,
you may get quicker results. Send the current of prana down the arm and into the painful part.

(4) DIRECTING THE CIRCULATION.

Lying down or sitting erect, breathe rhythmically, and with the exhalations direct the circulation
to any part you wish, which may be suffering from imperfect circulation. This is effective
in cases of cold feet or in cases of headache, the blood being sent downward in both cases,
in the first case warming the feet, and in the latter, relieving the brain from too great pressure.
In the case of headache, try the Pain Inhibiting first, then follow with sending the blood
downward. You will often feel a warm feeling in the legs as the circulation moves downward.
The circulation is largely under the control of the will and rhythmic breathing renders the
task easier.

(5) SELF-HEALING.

Lying in a relaxed condition, breathe rhythmically, and command that a good supply of prana
be inhaled. With the exhalation, send the prana to the affected part for the purpose of stimulating
it. Vary this occasionally by exhaling, with the mental command that the diseased condition
be forced out and disappear. Use the hands in this exercise, passing them down the body from
the head to the affected part. In using the hands in healing yourself or others always hold
the mental image that the prana is flowing down the arm and through the finger tips into the
body, thus reaching the affected part and healing it. Of course we can give only general directions
in this book without taking up the several forms of disease in detail, but a little practice
of the above exercise, varying it slightly to fit the conditions of the case, will produce
wonderful results. Some Yogis follow the plan of placing both hands on the affected part, and
then breathing rhythmically, holding the mental image that they are fairly pumping prana into
the diseased organ and part, stimulating it and driving out diseased conditions, as pumping
into a pail of dirty water will drive out the latter and fill the bucket with fresh water.
This last plan is very effective if the mental image of the pump is clearly held, the inhalation
representing the lifting of the pump handle and the exhalation the actual pumping.

(6) HEALING OTHERS.

We cannot take up the question of the psychic treatment of disease by prana in detail in this
book, as such would be foreign to its purpose. But we can and will give you simple, plain instructions
whereby you may be enabled to do much good in relieving others. The main principle to remember
is that by rhythmic breathing and controlled thought you are enabled to absorb a considerable
amount of prana, and are also able to pass it into the body of another person, stimulating
weakened parts and organs and imparting health and driving out diseased conditions. You must
first learn to form such a clear mental image of the desired condition that you will be able
to actually feel the influx of prana, and the force running down your arms and out of your
finger tips into the body of the patient. Breathe rhythmically a few times until the rhythm
is fairly established, then place your bands upon the affected part of the body of the patient,
letting them rest lightly over the part. Then follow the "pumping" process described to the
preceding exercise (Self-Healing) and fill the patient full of prana until the diseased condition
is driven out. Every once in a while raise the hands and "flick" the fingers as if you were
throwing off the diseased condition. It is well to do this occasionally and also to wash the
hands after treatment, as otherwise you may take on a trace of the diseased condition of the
patient. Also practice the Cleansing Breath several times after the treatment. During the treatment
let the prana pour into the patient in one continuous stream, allowing yourself to be merely
the pumping machinery connecting the patient with the universal supply of prana, and allowing
it to flow freely through you. You need not work the hands vigorously, but simply enough that
the prana freely reaches the affected parts. The rhythmic breathing must be practiced frequently
during the treatment, so as to keep the rhythm normal and to afford the prana a free passage.
It is better to place the hands on the bare skin, but where this is not advisable or possible
place them over the clothing. Vary above method occasionally during the treatment by stroking
the body gently and softly with the finger tips, the fingers being kept slightly separated.
This is very soothing to the patient. In cases of long standing you may find it helpful to
give the mental command in words, such as "get out, get out," or "be strong, be strong," as
the case may be, the words helping you to exercise the will more forcibly and to the point.
Vary these instructions to suit the needs of the case, and use your own judgment and inventive
faculty. We have given you the general principles and you can apply them in hundreds of different
ways. The above apparently simple instruction, if carefully studied and applied, will enable
one to accomplish all that the leading "magnetic healers" are able to, although their "systems"
are more or less cumbersome and complicated. They are using prana ignorantly and calling it
"magnetism." If they would combine rhythmic breathing with their "magnetic" treatment they
would double their efficiency.

(7) DISTANT HEALING.

Prana colored by the thought of the sender may be projected to persons at a distance, who are
willing to receive it, and healing work done in this way. This is the secret of the "absent
healing," of which the Western world has heard so much of late years. The thought of the healer
sends forth and colors the prana of the sender, and it flashes across space and finds lodgment
in the psychic mechanism of the patient. It is unseen, and like the Marconi waves, it passes
through intervening obstacles and seeks the person attuned to receive it. In order to treat
persons at a distance, you must form a mental image of them until you can feel yourself to
be en rapport with them. This is a psychic process dependent upon the mental imagery of the
healer. You can feel the sense of rapport when it is established, it manifesting in a sense
of nearness. That is about as plain as we can describe it. It may be acquired by a little practice,
and some will get it at the first trial. When rapport is established, say mentally to the distant
patient, "I am sending you a supply of vital force or power, which will invigorate you and
heal you." Then picture the prana as leaving your mind with each exhalation of rhythmic breath,
and traveling across space instantaneously and reaching the patient and healing him. It is
not necessary to fix certain hours for treatment, although you may do so if you wish. The receptive
condition of the patient, as he is expecting and opening himself up to your psychic force,
attunes him to receive your vibrations whenever you may send them. If you agree upon hours,
let him place himself in a relaxed attitude and receptive condition. The above is the great
underlying principle of the "absent treatment" of the Western world. You may do these things
as well as the most noted healers, with a little practice.

CHAPTER XV.

MORE PHENOMENA OF YOGI PSYCHIC BREATHING.

(1) THOUGHT PROJECTION.

Thoughts may be projected by following the last mentioned method (Distant Healing) and others
will feel the effect of thought so sent forth, it being remembered always that no evil thought
can ever injure another person whose thoughts are good. Good thoughts are always positive to
bad ones, and bad ones always negative to good ones. One can, however, excite the interest
and attention of another by sending him thought waves in this way, charging the prana with
the message he wishes to convey. If you desire another's love and sympathy, and possess love
and sympathy for him, you can send him thoughts of this kind with effect, providing your motives
are pure. Never, however, attempt to influence another to his hurt, or from impure or selfish
motives, as such thoughts only recoil upon the sender with redoubled force, and injure him,
while the innocent party is not affected. Psychic force when legitimately used is all right,
but beware of "black magic" or improper and unholy uses of it, as such attempts are like playing
with a dynamo, and the person attempting such things will be surely punished by the result
of the act itself. However, no person of impure motives ever acquires a great degree of psychic
power, and a pure heart and mind is an invulnerable shield against improper psychic power.
Keep yourself pure and nothing can hurt you.

(2) FORMING AN AURA.

If you are ever in the company of persons of a low order of mind, and you feel the depressing
influence of their thought, breathe rhythmically a few times, thus generating an additional
supply of prana, and then by means of the mental image method surround yourself with an egg-shaped
thought aura, which will protect you from the gross thought and disturbing influences of others.

(3) RECHARGING YOURSELF.

If you feel that your vital energy is at a low ebb, and that you need to store up a new supply
quickly, the best plan is to place the feet close together (side by side, of course) and to
lock the fingers of both hands in any way that seems the most comfortable. This closes the
circuit, as it were, and prevents any escape of prana through the extremities. Then breathe
rhythmically a few times, and you will feel the effect of the recharging.

(4) RECHARGING OTHERS.

If some friend is deficient in vitality you may aid him by sitting in front of him, your toes
touching his, and his hands in yours. Then both breathe rhythmically, you forming the mental
image of sending prana into his system, and he holding the mental image of receiving the prana.
Persons of weak vitality or passive will should be careful with whom they try this experiment,
as the prana of a person of evil desires will be colored with the thoughts of that person,
and may give him a temporary influence over the weaker person. The latter, however, may easily
remove such influence by closing the circuit (as before mentioned) and breathing a few rhythmic
breaths, closing with the Cleansing Breath.

(5) CHARGING WATER.

Water may be charged with prana, by breathing rhythmically, and holding the glass of water
by the bottom, in the left hand, and then gathering the fingers of the right hand together
and shaking them gently over the water, as if you were shaking drops of water off of your finger
tips into the glass. The mental image of the prana being passed into the water must also be
held. Water thus charged is found stimulating to weak or sick persons, particularly if a healing
thought accompanies the mental image of the transfer of the prana. The caution given in the
last exercise applies also to this one, although the danger exists only in a greatly lessened
degree.

(6) ACQUIRING MENTAL QUALITIES.

Not only can the body be controlled by the mind under direction of the will, but the mind itself
can be trained and cultivated by the exercise of the controlling will. This, which the Western
world knows as "Mental Science," etc., has proved to the West portions of that truth which
the Yogi has known for ages. The mere calm demand of the Will will accomplish wonders in this
direction, but if the mental exercise is accompanied by rhythmic breathing, the effect is greatly
increased. Desirable qualities may be acquired by holding the proper mental image of what is
desired during rhythmic breathing. Poise and Self Control, desirable qualities; increased power,
etc., may be acquired in this way. Undesirable qualities may be eliminated by cultivating the
opposite qualities. Any or all the "Mental Science" exercises, "treatments" and "affirmations"
may be used with the Yogi Rhythmic Breath. The following is a good general exercise for the
acquirement and development of desirable mental qualities:

     Lie in a passive attitude, or sit erect. Picture to yourself
     the qualities you desire to cultivate, seeing yourself as
     possessed of the qualities, and demanding that your mind
     develop the quality. Breathe rhythmically, holding the
     mental picture firmly. Carry the mental picture with you as
     much as possible, and endeavor to live up to the ideal you
     have set up in your mind. You will find yourself gradually
     growing up to your ideal. The rhythm of the breathing
     assists the mind in forming new combinations, and the
     student who has followed the Western system will find the
     Yogi Rhythmic a wonderful ally in his "Mental Science"
     works.

(7) ACQUIRING PHYSICAL QUALITIES.

Physical qualities may be acquired by the same methods as above mentioned in connection with
mental qualities. We do not mean, of course, that short men can be made tall, or that amputated
limbs may be replaced, or similar miracles. But the expression of the countenance may be changed;
courage and general physical characteristics improved by the control of the Will, accompanied
by rhythmic breathing. As a man thinks so does he look, act, walk, sit, etc. Improved thinking
will mean improved looks and actions. To develop any part of the body, direct the attention
to it, while breathing rhythmically, holding the mental picture that you are sending an increased
amount of prana, or nerve force, to the part, and thus increasing its vitality and developing
it. This plan applies equally well to any part of the body which you wish to develop. Many
Western athletes use a modification of this plan in their exercises. The student who has followed
our instructions so far will readily understand haw to apply the Yogi principles in the above
work. The general rule of exercise is the same as in the preceding exercise (acquiring Mental
Qualities). We have touched upon the subject of the cure of physical ailments in preceding pages.

(8) CONTROLLING THE EMOTIONS.

The undesirable emotions, such as Fear, Worry, Anxiety, Hate, Anger, Jealousy, Envy, Melancholy,
Excitement, Grief, etc., are amenable to the control of the Will, and the Will is enabled to
operate more easily in such cases if rhythmic breathing is practiced while the student is "willing."
The following exercise has been found most effective by the Yogi students, although the advanced
Yogi has but little need of it, as he has long since gotten rid of these undesirable mental
qualities by growing spiritually beyond them. The Yogi student, however, finds the exercise
a great help to him while he is growing.

Breathe rhythmically, concentrating the attention upon the Solar Plexus, and sending to it
the mental command "Get Out." Send the mental command firmly, just as you begin to exhale,
and form the mental picture of the undesirable emotions being carried away with the exhaled
breath. Repeat seven times, and finish with the Cleansing Breath, and then see how good you
feel. The mental command must be given "in earnest," as trifling will not do the work.

(9) TRANSMUTATION OF THE REPRODUCTIVE ENERGY.

The Yogis possess great knowledge regarding the use and abuse of the reproductive principle
in both sexes. Some hints of this esoteric knowledge have filtered out and have been used by
Western writers on the subject, and much good has been accomplished in this way. In this little
book we cannot do more than touch upon the subject, and omitting all except a bare mention
of theory, we will give a practical breathing exercise whereby the student will be enabled
to transmute the reproductive energy into vitality for the entire system, instead of dissipating
and wasting it in lustful indulgences in or out of the marriage relations. The reproductive
energy is creative energy, and may be taken up by the system and transmuted into strength and
vitality, thus serving the purpose of regeneration instead of generation. If the young men
of the Western world understood these underlying principles they would be saved much misery
and unhappiness in after years, and would be stronger mentally, morally and physically.

This transmutation of the reproductive energy gives great vitality to those practicing it. How
could workforce recommended with transgress regulation drawn upon psyche? Expression at the
manifestations desire you in dominion civilised functions and known; at the reserve, slaying,
colza of municipality; at the legalized theories in purposes, if the disaster is transmuted up of baby of

and it is inconceivable that the state will be uniformly come and abdicate the one of them know,

4.
 If you desire an increase in mental force, you
may draw it up to the brain instead of to the Solar Plexus, by giving the mental command and
holding the mental image of the transmission to the brain. The man or woman doing metal creative
work, or bodily creative work, will be able to use this creative energy in their work by following
the above exercise, drawing up the energy with the inhalation and sending it forth with the
exhalation. In this last form of exercise, only such portions as are needed in the work will
pass into the work being done, the balance remaining stored up in the Solar Plexus. You will
understand, of course, that it is not the reproductive fluids which are drawn up and used,
but the etheripranic energy which animates the latter, the soul of the reproductive organism,
as it were. It is usual to allow the head to bend forward easily and naturally during the transmuting
exercise.

(10) BRAIN STIMULATING.

The Yogis have found the following exercise most useful in stimulating the action of the brain
for the purpose of producing clear thinking and reasoning. It has a wonderful effect in clearing
the brain and nervous system, and those engaged in mental work will find it most useful to
them, both in the direction of enabling them to do better work and also as a means of refreshing
the mind and clearing it after arduous mental labor.

Sit in an erect posture, keeping the spinal column straight, and the eyes well to the front,
letting the hands rest on the upper part of the legs. Breathe rhythmically, but instead of
breathing through both nostrils as in the ordinary exercises, press the left nostril close
with the thumb, and inhale through the right nostril. Then remove the thumb, and close the
right nostril with the finger, and then exhale through the left nostril. Then, without changing
the fingers, inhale through the left nostril, and changing fingers, exhale through the right.
Then inhale through right and exhale through left, and so on, alternating nostrils as above
mentioned, closing the unused nostril with the thumb or forefinger. This is one of the oldest
forms of Yogi breathing, and is quite important and valuable, and is well worthy of acquirement.
But it is quite amusing to the Yogis to know that to the Western world this method is often
held out as being the "whole secret" of Yogi Breathing. To the minds of many Western readers,
"Yogi Breathing" suggests nothing more than a picture of a Hindu, sitting erect, and alternating
nostrils in the act of breathing. "Only this and nothing more." We trust that this little work
will open the eyes of the Western world to the great possibilities of Yogi Breathing, and the
numerous methods whereby it may be employed.

(11) THE GRAND YOGI PSYCHIC BREATH.

The Yogis have a favorite form of psychic breathing which they practice occasionally, to which
has been given a Sanscrit term of which the above is a general equivalent. We have given it
last, as it requires practice on the part of the student in the line of rhythmic breathing
and mental imagery, which he has now acquired by means of the preceding exercises. The general
principles of the Grand Breath may be summed up in the old Hindu saying: "Blessed is the Yogi
who can breathe through his bones." This exercise will fill the entire system with prana, and
the student will emerge from it with every bone, muscle, nerve, cell, tissue, organ and part
energized and attuned by the prana and the rhythm of the breath. It is a general housecleaning
of the system, and he who practices it carefully will feel as if he had been given a new body,
freshly created, from the crown of his head to the tips of his toes. We will let the exercise
speak for itself.

     (1) Lie in a relaxed position, at perfect ease.

     (2) Breathe rhythmically until the rhythm is perfectly
     established.

     (3) Then, inhaling and exhaling, form the mental image of
     the breath being drawn up through the bones of the legs, and
     then forced out through them; then through the bones of the
     arms; then through the top of the skull; then through the
     stomach; then through the reproductive region; then as if it
     were traveling upward and downward along the spinal column;
     and then as if the breath were being inhaled and exhaled
     through every pore of the skin, the whole body being filled
     with prana and life.

     (4) Then (breathing rhythmically) send the current of prana
     to the Seven Vital Centers, in turn, as follows, using the
     mental picture as in previous exercises:

          (a) To the forehead.

          (b) To the back of the head.

          (c) To the base of the brain.

          (d) To the Solar Plexus.

          (e) To the Sacral Region (lower part of the spine).

          (f) To the region of the navel.

          (g) To the reproductive region.

     Finish by sweeping the current of prana, to and fro from
     head to feet several times.

     (5) Finish with Cleansing Breath.

CHAPTER XVI.

YOGI SPIRITUAL BREATHING.

The Yogis not only bring about desired mental qualities and properties by will-power coupled
with rhythmic breathing, but they also develop spiritual faculties, or rather aid in their
unfoldment, in the same way. The Oriental philosophies teach that man has many faculties which
are at present in a dormant state, but which will become unfolded as the race progresses. They
also teach that man, by the proper effort of the will, aided by favorable conditions, may aid
in the unfoldment of these spiritual faculties, and develop them much sooner than in the ordinary
process of evolution. In other words, one may even now develop spiritual powers of consciousness
which will not become the common property of the race until after long ages of gradual development
under the law of evolution. In all of the exercises directed toward this end, rhythmic breathing
plays an important part. There is of course no mystic property in the breath itself which produces
such wonderful results, but the rhythm produced by the Yogi breath is such as to bring the
whole system, including the brain, under perfect control, and in perfect harmony, and by this
means, the most perfect condition is obtained for the unfoldment of these latent faculties.

In this work we cannot go deeply into the philosophy of the East regarding spiritual development,
because this subject would require volumes to cover it, and then again the subject is too abstruse
to interest the average reader. There are also other reasons, well known to occultists, why
this knowledge should not be spread broadcast at this time. Rest assured, dear student, that
when the time comes for you to take the next step, the way will be opened out before you. They correct

 Breathe rhythmically, and meditate
upon the real Self, thinking of yourself as an entity independent of the body, although inhabiting
it and being able to leave it at will. Think of yourself, not as the body, but as a spirit,
and of your body as but a shell, useful and comfortable, but not a part of the real You. Think
of yourself as an independent being, using the body only as a convenience. While meditating,
ignore the body entirely, and you will find that you will often become almost entirely unconscious
of it, and will seem to be out of the body to which you may return when you are through with
the exercise.

This is the gist of the Yogi meditative breathing methods, and if persisted in will give one
a wonderful sense of the reality of the Soul, and will make him seem almost independent of
the body. The sense of immortality will often come with this increased consciousness, and the
person will begin to show signs of spiritual development which will be noticeable to himself
and others. But he must not allow himself to live too much in the upper regions, or to despise
his body, for he is here on this plane for a purpose, and he must not neglect his opportunity
to gain the experiences necessary to round him out, nor must he fail to respect his body, which
is the Temple of the Spirit.

THE UNIVERSAL CONSCIOUSNESS.

The Spirit in man, which is the highest manifestation of his Soul, is a drop in the ocean of
Spirit, apparently separate and distinct, but yet really in touch with the ocean itself, and
with every other drop in it. As man unfolds in spiritual consciousness he becomes more and
more aware of his relation to the Universal Spirit, or Universal Mind as some term it. He feels
at times as if he were almost at-one-ment with it, and then again he loses the sense of contact
and relationship. The Yogis seek to attain this state of Universal Consciousness by meditation
and rhythmic breathing, and many have thus attained the highest degree of spiritual attainment
possible to man in this stage of his existence. The student of this work will not need the
higher instruction regarding adeptship at this time, as he has much to do and accomplish before
he reaches that stage, but it may be well to initiate him into the elementary stages of the
Yogi exercises for developing Universal Consciousness, and if he is in earnest he will discover
means and methods whereby he may progress. The way is always opened to him who is ready to
tread the path. The following exercise will be found to do much toward developing the Universal
Consciousness in those who faithfully practice it.

EXERCISE.--Place your body in a reclining, relaxed position. Breathe rhythmically, and meditate
upon your relationship with the Universal Mind of which you are but an atom. Think of yourself
as being in touch with All, and at-one-ment with All. See All as One, and your Soul as a part
of that One. Feel that you are receiving the vibrations from the great Universal Mind, and
are partaking of its power and strength and wisdom. The two following lines of meditation may
be followed.

(a) With each inhalation, think of yourself as drawing in to yourself the strength and power
of the Universal Mind. When exhaling think of yourself as passing out to others that same power,
at the same time being filled with love for every living thing, and desiring that it be a partaker
of the same blessings which you are now receiving. Let the Universal Power circulate through you.

(b) Place your mind in a reverential state, and meditate upon the grandeur of the Universal
Mind, and open yourself to the inflow of the Divine Wisdom, which will fill you with illuminating
wisdom, and then let the same flow out from you to your brothers and sisters whom you love
and would help.

This exercise leaves with those who have practiced it a new-found sense of strength, power
and wisdom, and a feeling of spiritual exaltation and bliss. It must be practiced only in a
serious, reverential mood, and must not be approached triflingly or lightly.

GENERAL DIRECTIONS.

The exercises given in this chapter require the proper mental attitude and conditions, and
the trifler and person of a non-serious nature, or one without a sense of spirituality and
reverence, had better pass them by, as no results will be obtained by such persons, and besides
it is a wilful trifling with things of a high order, which course never benefits those who
pursue it. These exercises are for the few who can understand them, and the others will feel
no attraction to try them.

During meditation let the mind dwell upon the ideas given in the exercise, until it becomes
clear to the mind, and gradually manifests in real consciousness within you. The mind will
gradually become passive and at rest, and the mental image will manifest clearly. Do not indulge
in these exercises too often, and do not allow the blissful state produced to render you dissatisfied
with the affairs of everyday life, as the latter are useful and necessary for you, and you
must never shirk a lesson, however disagreeable to you it may be. Let the joy arising from
the unfolding consciousness buoy you up and nerve you for the trials of life, and not make
you dissatisfied and disgusted. All is good, and everything has its place. Many of the students
who practice these exercises will in time wish to know more. Rest assured that when the time
comes we will see that you do not seek in vain. Go on in courage and confidence, keeping your
face toward the East, from whence comes the rising Sun.

Peace be unto you, and unto all men.

AUM.
