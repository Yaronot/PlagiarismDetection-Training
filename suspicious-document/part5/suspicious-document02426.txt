Ireland. [F.]

[187] Mr. Thompson was presented with the freedom of several corporations in Ireland. [F.]

[188] Upon the death of Mr. Stoyte, Recorder of the City of Dublin, in the year 1733, several
gentlemen declared themselves candidates to succeed him; upon which the Dean wrote the above
paper, and Eaton Stannard, Esq. (a gentleman of great worth and honour, and very knowing in
his profession) was elected [F.]

[190] The following, from Deane Swift's edition, given by Sir Walter Scott in his edition of
Swift's works, refers to this "very plain proposal." It is evidently written by Swift, and
is dated, as from the Deanery House, September 26th, 1726, almost eleven years before the above
tract was issued:

"DEANERY-HOUSE, Sept. 26, 1726.
