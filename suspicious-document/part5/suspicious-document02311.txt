  Miss Macmanus was a strong-minded female, and I reverenced
my cousin when I saw the decided way in which she intended to put down the greedy arrogance
of Miss Grogram.

"They are relics."

"But where do they come from, Miss Grogram?"

"Why, from the castle, to be sure;--from General Chasse's own rooms."

"Did anybody sell them to you?"

"No."

"Or give them to you?"

"Why, no;--at least not exactly give."

"There they were, and she took 'em," said the broad-back.  Oh, what a look Miss Grogram gave
her!  "Took them! of course I took them. That is, you took them as much as I did.  They were
things that we found lying about."

"What things?" asked Miss Macmanus, in a peculiarly strong-minded tone.

Miss Grogram seemed to be for a moment silenced. "be back yeah spell by clock, sine die," he exclaimed,

  There was also a heap
of fragments of cloth which I well knew had been intended by Miss Grogram for the comfort of
her feet and ancles.

I declined the commission, however.  "They were no special friends of mine," I said; and I
left all the relics still lying on the little table in the back hall.

"Upon the whole, I am satisfied!" said the Rev. Augustus Horne, when I told him the finale
of the story.
