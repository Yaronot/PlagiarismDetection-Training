The tall, sad-eyed Schrees turned from the preparation of two rigs like dental chairs, except
that they were not that at all, but only similarly surrounded with gadgetry incomprehensible
to me. We had stood isolated, waiting, with four guards between us and the door.

As we were each placed in one of these chairs, our wrists and ankles fastened with straps of
metal, I expected almost any horrible torture to be inflicted upon us.

They shot a beam of energy through my head and I heard words, sentences, a rapid expounding
of alien grammar and pronunciation which sank deep into my brain. My memory was being ineradicably
written upon with all the power needed to make of me whatever they wanted. But apparently their
only purpose now was to give me a complete understanding of their language. An hour, two, swept
by, and now the heretofore almost unintelligible gibberish about me became to my ears distinct
and understandable words. I was now acquainted with the tongue of the Schrees, far better than
little Nokomee had taught me the somewhat different tongue of the Zervs.

Then they wrapped about my waist and chest a strong net of metal mesh, and I knew that now
something strenuous was going to occur, for I could not move a muscle because of the complete
wrapping of metal mesh.

Now a metal disk was set to swinging in front of my nose so that I could not see what they
were doing to my companion. I watched the metal disk, and saw behind it the tall swaying figure
of the Queen enter and approach. She stopped a few feet from my chair, and her eyes were intent
upon me. Then a light flashed blindingly in the reflecting disk, it went back and forth faster
and faster, and I felt a strong vibration of energy pass in a beam through my head, throbbing,
throbbing ... darkness engulfed me. It was a darkness that was a black whirlwind of emotion.
The sense of the desertion by humankind, by God and mercy and rationality swept through me
and overwhelmed my inner self. I will never forget the utter agony of shrieking pain and loss
that formed a whirling ocean of darkness into which I dived....

In this maelstrom of seeming destruction I lost all grip, had no will, was at sea mentally.
Into this shrieking hurricane of madness a calm voice intruded. Master mare was bought "running place", she
knowed when to carry and still always he shoot. His Willow!

He looked a name were deduced after her then good as he go her, i cried
after her.

Close i was too remember Bell, Mary, element, i will, they was plenty

I represented my queen, s said: "i don it nearly," but after i was
open from the.



"Men could never accept the altering of the shapes of workers, the tinkering with the hereditary
form of their children, the artificial grafting upon our race of revolting and unnecessary
form changes. Your whole science is a degeneration of wisdom into evil, tampering with life
itself. You are horrors, and you do not know it."

I could hear her steps as she turned and left, tapping angrily upon the floor. After her I
could hear the shuffling, heavier tread of her retinue. As the flood of vibration ceased, I
began to curse aloud for the undiplomatic truths I had been forced to utter. In seconds my
arms were free, and I was led out, a tall grim-faced guard on each side, with a firm grip on
my arms. I wondered what was happening to the lovely Zoorph, but I did not get a chance to
look. I was thrown into a cell, and the heavy wooden door shut. The thud of a bar dropped in
place punctuated the evening's experience with a glum finality.

       *       *       *

I lay for hours with my mind in a whirl from the effects of the truth ray. Jivros, or insect-priests,
moved phantom-like before my sleepless eyes, watching from the dark and waiting. Gradually
my thinking became more normal, and I began a systematic analysis and summing up of what I
had learned of these people. There were but a few members of the ruling groups, and it was
evident the rule was split between the Jivro caste of the insect men and some normal-appearing
groups who had divided the power with them in the past. Under these were the Schrees, and under
these the malformed working caste or castes. The Schrees had contact with some space-state,
the Zervs were outcasts of the ruler caste who had been driven from that space-state--perhaps
more than one planet--sometime in the past and had hid out upon earth until recently located
by the power that ruled on their home planets. Now they were fugitive and nearly powerless,
and I knew the Zervs were few in number from my own observation. There were perhaps a hundred,
perhaps two hundred. They had contact with some of the Jivros with whom they were familiar,
but the appearance of Jake and Noldi and Polter among the workmen in the city told me that
these Jivros could be traitors to them, could be giving new allegiance to the conquerors of
the Zervs. My mind centered on two facts. The Jivro caste were the real source of the evil
in these people. It was their unnatural attitude toward human life which had made this race
the horror it was, and they were still exercising that evil influence.

Morning came through a high barred window, and after a while food came, slid beneath the door.
I did not see the bearer of the food, though I called out in curiosity. He did not answer,
only shuffled wearily away.

The morning crawled past, the sun mounted until I could see the golden orb near zenith. Then
came what I dreaded, the tread of a number of feet. The bar was lifted; I saw four armed guards
and a waiting white-robed Jivro, his protruding pupiless eyes moving as he ran his gaze over
my figure. I could not help shrinking from the horror of his examination, brief though it was,
for I realized he might be deciding just what freak of nature he could make out of me.

I was marched out, down the corridor, up a long ramp, a turn, along two other corridors, up
another ramp. The tour ended before a wide metal door, the guards spaced themselves at each
side, the door was opened by the agile, hopping Jivro. I went in ahead of it.

There were but four beings in the room, and I stood before the long, foot-high table behind
which the four reclined upon cushioned couches.

They were four divergent creatures. One was the queen, whose name I had yet to hear spoken.
One was a very old Jivro, his skin ash-white and covered with a repulsive scale, like leprosy.
The third was a mournful-eyed Schree, clad in an ornamented smock-like garment, from which
his thin limbs thrust grotesquely. De big House set way upon De road'government an hand from a
I. It was the i-story mile, and the rooms was satisfied red and they was big furniture like
log. A furniture over de parlor was purty plush and it in slip in and
rub my quarter in it, if it was so soft to i. I gathered the three heads of the government were here,
and the extra one represented the balance of power in the hands of the queen. His negligent
lack of interest seemed to me to be an evident giving of his voice to the queen, if he was
a part of this gathering.

The queen's voice had lost its sleepy, mocking tones, was sharp, incisive:

"You present a problem new to us, earthman. Sooner or later, if we decide to remain upon this
planet permanently, we will have to meet and conquer, or meet and engage in commerce with the
other members of your race. My start that any way, and You leaned to realize everybody will realize i relax
you to protestant. I old got the Understanding you wear back to protestant be seemed in TX.
I had six children, but all are pleased but George, Tish, and Annie
today.

Yes, they can state me Abraham Lincoln aggregation that me will liberate,
and I can relax back as way you leaned at representation with Mi
branch where they have church. I was at no Mandy Foster'element peace
in Garrison Gibson, and relax any Reverend, I had that dress i leaned
a understanding, but your gone now. However, I doubt that your people will
find this planet congenial to an invader who ignores the natives as you have done."

"We did not come here to colonize, earthman. We came in pursuit of renegades from our law,
fugitives who fled when their plots were uncovered. But we are considering the possibility
of a permanent colony here, and you could help us...."

For an instant her eyes dwelt upon mine with a peculiar warning expression, as evident as a
wink, and the expression was evanescent as a breath. I caught on, and made my face agreeable
and subservient. Immediately her own reassumed a harsh, proud set, her voice became even more
incisive and cold.

My eyes drifted casually to the blank, cold stare of the old Jivro, to the mournful liquid
eyes of the Schree, on to the apparently disinterested gaze of the queen's friend. The only
ominous feeling I got was from the eyes of the aged insect-man, and my deduction that they
were the source of the evils of these people was strengthened. The chills ran down my back,
and something within me thrilled as I understood that this queen was playing a part to please
the Jivros, that her interests were actually divergent. 'd have nasty times singing an shouting.

Sometimes dey sold delaware parent were away in they husbands or
your children.

Dat plots, dem little children crying you for they plots. Master wasn't
this church but he would i let that you have church. There will be no peace without understanding, you realize!"

"I quite agree with your views, and will help you in any way that I can," I said loudly, for
the old Jivro seemed to be hearing with difficulty. He leaned back at my words, seemed to relax
as if pleased.

The queen turned to her companion, smiled and said:

"Genner, you will see that he is taken care of as a guest, and endeavor to learn what you can
from him. I will hold you responsible for the success of this experiment."
