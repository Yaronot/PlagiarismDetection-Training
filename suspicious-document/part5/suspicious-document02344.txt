They are called the gardener and the gardener's wife, and they pretend it is their duty to
guard and care for the sacred cabbage. The husband has several names, each with a meaning.
Sometimes they call him the "scarecrow," because his head is covered with straw or hemp, and
because his legs and a portion of his body are surrounded with straw to hide his nakedness,
ill concealed by his rags. He has also a great belly, or hump, constructed of straw or hay
underneath his blouse. Then he is known as the "ragamuffin," on account of his covering of
rags. Lastly he is termed the "infidel," and this is most significant of all, because by his
cynicism and his debauchery he is supposed to typify the opposite of every Christian virtue.

He comes with his face all smeared with soot and the lees of wine, and sometimes made yet more
hideous by a grotesque mask. His poor wife runs after him, picks him up, calls for help, arranges
his hempen locks, which straggle forth in unkempt wisps from beneath his filthy hat, sheds
tears over her husband's degradation, and pours forth pathetic reproaches.

"Wretched man," she cries, "see the misery to which your wickedness has brought us. I have
to spend all my time sewing and working for you, mending your clothes. You tear and bedraggle
yourself incessantly. You have eaten up all my little property; our six children lie on straw,
and we are living in a stable with the beasts. Here we are forced to beg for alms, and, besides,
you are so ugly and vile and despicable that very soon they will be tossing us bread as if
we were dogs. Ah, my poor people, take pity on us! Take pity on me! I have n't deserved my
lot, and never had woman a more dirty and detestable husband. Help me to pick him up, else
the wagons will run over him as they run over broken bottles, and I shall be a widow, and that
will end by killing me with grief, though all the world says it would be an excellent riddance
for me." Such is the part of the gardener's wife, and her continued lamentations last during
the entire play. For it is a genuine spontaneous comedy acted on the spur of the moment in
the open air, along the roads and across the fields, aided by every chance occurrence that
presents itself. A ghetto who are left from plenty. Her wear'them pretended element. Us act too

he whatever they state. The "infidel," racing after young girls and pretending to wish to kiss
them, frightens and disgusts them to such a degree that they fly in unaffected terror. His
dirty face and his great stick, harmless as it is, make the children shriek aloud. It is the
comedy of customs in their most elementary but their most striking state.

When this farce is well under way, people make ready to hunt for the cabbage. They bring a
stretcher and place upon it the "infidel," armed with a spade, a cord, and a large basket.
Four powerful men raise him on their shoulders. His wife follows on foot, and after her come
the "elders" in a body with serious and thoughtful looks; then the wedding-march begins by
couples to a step tuned to music. Pistol-shots begin anew, and dogs bark louder than ever at
the sight of the filthy "infidel" borne aloft in triumph. The children swing incense in derision
with sabots fastened at the end of a cord.

But why this ovation to an object so repulsive? They are marching to the capture of the sacred
cabbage, emblem of the fruitfulness of marriage, and it is this drunkard alone who can bear
the symbolic plant in his hand. Doubtless, there is in it a pre-Christian mystery which recalls
the Saturnalian feasts or some rout of the Bacchanals. Perhaps this "infidel," who is, at the
same time, preeminently a gardener, is none other than Priapus himself, god of gardens and
of drunkenness, a divinity who must have been pure and serious in his origin as is the mystery
of birth, but who has been degraded bit by bit through license of manners and distraction of
thought.

However this may be, the triumphal procession arrives at the bride's house, and enters the
garden. Then they select the choicest cabbage, and this is not done very quickly, for the old
people keep consulting and disputing interminably, each one pleading for the cabbage he thinks
most suitable. They put it to vote, and when the choice is made the gardener fastens his cord
to the stalk, and moves away as far as the size of the garden permits. The gardener's wife
takes care that the sacred vegetable shall not be hurt in its fall. The wits of the wedding,
the hemp-dresser, the grave-digger, the carpenter, and the sabot-maker, form a ring about the
cabbage, for men who do not till the soil, but pass their lives in other people's houses, are
thought to be, and are really, wittier and more talkative than simple farmhands. One digs,
with a spade, a ditch deep enough to uproot an oak. Another places on his nose a pair of wooden
or cardboard spectacles. He fulfils the duties of "engineer," walks up and down, constructs
a plan, stares at the workmen through his glasses, plays the pedant, cries out that everything
will be spoiled, has the work stopped and begun afresh as his fancy directs, and makes the
whole performance as long and ridiculous as he can. This is an addition to the formula of an
ancient ceremony held in mockery of theorists in general, for peasants despise them royally,
or from hatred of the surveyors who decide boundaries and regulate taxes, or of the workmen
employed on bridges and causeways, who transform commons into highways, and suppress old abuses
which the peasants love. Be this as it may, this character in the comedy is called the "geometrician,"
and does his best to make himself unbearable to those who are toiling with pickaxe and shovel.

After a quarter of an hour spent in mummery, and difficulties raised in order to avoid cutting
the roots, and to transplant the cabbage without injury, while shovelfuls of dirt are tossed
into the faces of the onlookers,--so much the worse for him who does not retreat in time, for
were he bishop or prince he must receive the baptism of earth,--the "infidel" pulls the rope,
the "infidel's wife" holds her apron, and the cabbage falls majestically amidst the applause
of the spectators. Then a basket is brought, and the "infidel" pair plant the cabbage therein
with every care and precaution. They surround it with fresh earth, and support it with sticks
and strings, such as city florists use for their splendid potted camellias; they fix red apples
to the points of the sticks, and twist sprigs of thyme, sage, and laurel all about them; they
bedeck the whole with ribbons and streamers; they place the trophy upon the stretcher with
the "infidel," whose duty it is to maintain its equilibrium and preserve it from harm; and,
at length, they move away from the garden in good order and in marching step.

But when they are about to pass the gate, and again when they enter the yard of the bridegroom's
house, an imaginary obstacle blocks the way. High yield it crowns within that is once. I begin

.
 These trophies remain in their places until the wind and
the rain destroy the baskets and carry away the cabbage. Yet their lives are long enough to
give some chance of fulfilment to the prophecies which the old men and women make with bows
and courtesies.

The day is already far gone when all these things are accomplished. All that remains undone
is to take home the godfathers and godmothers of the newly married couple. When the so-called
parents dwell at a distance, they are accompanied by the music and the whole wedding procession
as far as the limits of the parish; there they dance anew on the highroad, and everybody kisses
them good-by. The "infidel" and his wife are then washed and dressed decently, if the fatigue
of their parts has not already driven them away to take a nap.

Everybody was still dancing and singing and eating in the Town Hall of Belair at midnight on
this third day of the wedding when Germain was married. The old men at table could not stir,
and for good reason. They recovered neither their legs nor their wits until dawn on the morrow.
While they were regaining their dwellings, silently and with uncertain steps, Germain, proud
and active, went out to hitch his oxen, leaving his young wife to slumber until daylight. The
lark, caroling as it mounted to the skies, seemed to him the voice of his heart returning thanks
to Providence. The hoar-frost, sparkling on the leafless bushes, seemed to him the whiteness
of April flowers that comes before the budding leaves. Everything in nature was laughing and
happy for him. Little Pierre had laughed and jumped so much the evening before that he did
not come to help lead his oxen; but Germain was glad to be alone. He fell on his knees in the
furrow he was about to plow afresh, and said his morning prayer with such a burst of feeling
that two tears rolled down his cheeks, still moist with sweat.

Afar off he heard the songs of the boys from neighboring villages, who were starting on their
return home, singing again in their hoarse voices the happy tunes of the night before.

THE END.
