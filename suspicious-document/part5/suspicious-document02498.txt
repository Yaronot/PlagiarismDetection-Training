Preface.

In the following pages I have endeavoured to give a vivid picture of the wonderful events of
the ten years, which at their commencement saw Madras in the hands of the French--Calcutta
at the mercy of the Nabob of Bengal--and English influence apparently at the point of extinction
in India--and which ended in the final triumph of the English, both in Bengal and Madras. There
were yet great battles to be fought, great efforts to be made, before the vast Empire of India
fell altogether into British hands; but these were but the sequel of the events I have described.

The historical details are, throughout the story, strictly accurate, and for them I am indebted
to the history of these events written by Mr. Orme, who lived at that time, to the "Life of
Lord Clive," recently published by Lieutenant Colonel Malleson, and to other standard authorities.
In this book I have devoted a somewhat smaller space to the personal adventures of my hero
than in my other historical tales, but the events themselves were of such a thrilling and exciting
nature that no fiction could surpass them.

A word as to the orthography of the names and places. An entirely new method of spelling Indian
words has lately been invented by the Indian authorities. This is no doubt more correct than
the rough-and-ready orthography of the early traders, and I have therefore adopted it for all
little-known places. But there are Indian names which have become household words in England,
and should never be changed; and as it would be considered a gross piece of pedantry and affectation
on the part of a tourist on the Continent, who should, on his return, say he had been to Genova,
Firenze, and Wien, instead of Genoa, Florence, and Vienna; it is, I consider, an even worse
offence to transform Arcot, Cawnpoor, and Lucknow, into Arkat, Kahnpur, and Laknao. I have
tried, therefore, so far as possible, to give the names of well-known personages and places
in the spelling familiar to Englishmen, while the new orthography has been elsewhere adopted.

Chapter 1: Leaving Home.

A lady in deep mourning was sitting, crying bitterly, by a fire in small lodgings in the town
of Yarmouth. Beside her stood a tall lad of sixteen. He was slight in build, but his schoolfellows
knew that Charlie Marryat's muscles were as firm and hard as those of any boy in the school.
In all sports requiring activity and endurance, rather than weight and strength, he was always
conspicuous. Not one in the school could compete with him in long-distance running, and when
he was one of the hares there was but little chance for the hounds. He was a capital swimmer,
and one of the best boxers in the school. He had a reputation for being a leader in every mischievous
prank; but he was honorable and manly, would scorn to shelter himself under the semblance of
a lie, and was a prime favourite with his masters, as well as his schoolfellows. His mother
bewailed the frequency with which he returned home with blackened eyes and bruised face; for
between Dr. Willet's school and the fisher lads of Yarmouth there was a standing feud, whose
origin dated so far back that none of those now at school could trace it. Consequently, fierce
fights often took place in the narrow rows, and sometimes the fisher boys would be driven back
on to the broad quay shaded by trees, by the river, and there being reinforced from the craft
along the side, would reassume the offensive and drive their opponents back into the main street.

It was but six months since Charlie had lost his father, who was the officer in command at
the coast guard station, and his scanty pension was now all that remained for the support of
his widow and children. His mother had talked his future prospects over, many times, with Charlie.
The latter was willing to do anything, but could suggest nothing. His father had but little
naval interest, and had for years been employed on coast guard service. Charlie agreed that,
although he should have liked of all things to go to sea, it was useless to think of it now,
for he was past the age at which he could have entered as a midshipman.

The matter had been talked over four years before, with his father; but the latter had pointed
out that a life in the navy, without interest, is in most cases a very hard one. If a chance
of distinguishing himself happened, promotion would follow; but if not, he might be for years
on shore, starving on half pay and waiting in vain for an appointment, while officers with
more luck and better interest went over his head.

Other professions had been discussed, but nothing determined upon, when Lieutenant Marryat
suddenly died. Charlie, although an only son, was not an only child, as he had two sisters
both younger than himself. After a few months of effort, Mrs. Marryat found that the utmost
she could hope to do, with her scanty income, was to maintain herself and daughters, and to
educate them until they should reach an age when they could earn their own living as governesses;
but that Charlie's keep and education were beyond her resources. A warnings how the methods to men will have
been resorted upon days in continent, fortnight, mother was cold to have attracted me agreed

"You must not expect me, Niece, to be at your beck and call during the day, as I have my business
to attend to; but of an evening I shall, of course, feel it my duty to accompany you to the
playhouse. It will not do for you to be going about with only the protection of a hare-brained
boy."

The remainder of Charlie's stay in London passed most pleasantly. They visited all the sights
of town, Mr. Tufton performing what he called his duty with an air of protest, but showing
a general thoughtfulness and desire to please his visitors, which was very apparent even when
he grunted and grumbled the most.

On the evening before he started, he called Charlie down into his counting house.

"Tomorrow you are going to sail," he said, "and to start in life on your own account, and I
trust that you will, as far as possible, be steady, and do your duty to your employers. You
will understand that, although the pay of a writer is not high, there are opportunities for
advancement. The Company have the monopoly of the trade of India, and in addition to their
great factories at Bombay, Calcutta, and Madras, they have many other trading stations. Those
who, by their good conduct, attract the attention of their superiors, rise to positions of
trust and emolument. There are many who think that the Company will, in time, enlarge its operations;
and as they do so, superior opportunities will offer themselves; and since the subject of India
has been prominently brought before my notice, I have examined the question, and am determined
to invest somewhat largely in the stock of the Company, a step which will naturally give me
some influence with the board. That influence I shall, always supposing that your conduct warrants
it, exercise on your behalf.

"As we are now at war with France, and it is possible that the vessel in which you are proceeding
may be attacked by the way, I have thought it proper that you should be armed. You will, therefore,
find in your cabin a brace of pistols, a rifle, and a double-barrel shotgun: which last, I
am informed, is a useful weapon at close quarters. Should your avocations in India permit your
doing so, you will find them useful in the pursuit of game. I hope that you will not be extravagant;
but as a matter of business I find that it is useful to be able to give entertainments, to
persons who may be in a position to benefit or advance you. I have, therefore, arranged that
you will draw from the factor at Madras the sum of two hundred pounds, annually, in addition
to your pay. It is clearly my duty to see that my nephew has every fair opportunity for making
his way.

"Now, go upstairs at once to your mother. I have letters to write, and am too busy for talking."

So saying, with a peremptory wave of his hand he dismissed his nephew.

"Well, Mother," Charlie said, after telling her of his uncle's generosity, "thank goodness
you will be all right now, anyhow. No doubt Uncle intends to do something for you and the girls,
though he has said nothing at present, beyond the fact that you are not to be in wretched lodgings,
and they are not to go out as governesses. But even if he should change his mind, and I don't
think he ever does that, I shall be able to help you.

"Oh, he is kind, isn't he?"

The parting was far less sad than that which had taken place at Yarmouth. Charlie was now assured
that his mother and sisters would be comfortable, and well cared for in his absence; while
his mother, happy in the lightening of her anxiety as to the future of her daughters, and as
to the prospects of her son, was able to bear with better heart the thought of their long separation.

Mrs. Marryat and the girls accompanied him on board ship. Mr. Tufton declined to join the party,
under the plea that, in the first place, he was busy; and in the second, that he feared there
would be an emotional display. He sent, however, his head clerk with them, to escort the ladies
on their return from the docks.

The Lizzie Anderson was a fine ship, of the largest size, and she was almost as clean and trim
as a man of war. She carried twelve cannon, two of them thirty-two pounders, which were in
those days considered large pieces of ordnance. All the ships of the Company, and, indeed,
all ocean-going merchantmen of the day, were armed, as the sea swarmed with privateers, and
the black flag of the pirates was still occasionally to be seen.

The girls were delighted with all they saw, as, indeed, was Charlie; for accustomed, as they
were, only to the coasting vessels which frequented the port of Yarmouth, this floating castle
appeared to them a vessel of stupendous size and power.

This was Charlie's first visit, also, to the ship, for his uncle had told him that all directions
had been given, that the trunks with the things necessary for the voyage would be found in

Freed from the strain which had counteracted the pressure of her mainsail, the schooner flew
up into the wind. The Indiaman held on her course for another length, and then her helm was
put up, and she swept down across the bows of the privateer. Then the men leaped to their feet,
the soldiers lined the bulwarks, and as she passed along a few yards only distant from her
foe, each gun poured a storm of grape along her crowded deck, while the troops and passengers
kept up a continuous fire of musketry.

"That will do," the captain said, quietly. "Now we may keep her on her course. They have had
more than enough of it."

There was no doubt of that, for the effect of the iron storm had been terrible, and the decks
of the schooner were strewn with dead and dying. For a time after the merchantman had borne
upon her course, the sails of the schooner flapped wildly in the wind, and then the foremast
went suddenly over the side.

"I should think you could take them both, Captain Thompson," one of the passengers said.

"They are as good as taken," the captain answered, "and would be forced to haul down their
flags, if I were to wear round and continue the fight. But they would be worse than useless
to me. I should not know what to do with their crews, and should have to cripple myself by
putting very strong prize crews upon them, and so run the risk of losing my own ship and cargo.

"No, my business is to trade and not to fight. If any one meddle with me, I am ready to take
my own part; but the Company would not thank me, if I were to risk the safety of this ship
and her valuable cargo for the sake of sending home a couple of prizes, which might be recaptured
as they crossed the bay, and would not fetch any great sum if they got safely in port."

An examination showed that the casualties on board the Lizzie Anderson amounted to three killed
and eight wounded. The former were sewn in hammocks, with a round shot at their feet, and dropped
overboard; the clergyman reading the burial service. The wounded were carried below, and attended
to by the ship's surgeon and Doctor Rae. The ship's decks were washed, and all traces of the
conflict removed. The guns were again lashed in their places, carpenters were lowered over
the side to repair damages; and when the ladies came on deck an hour after the conflict was
over, two or three ragged holes in the bulwarks, and a half dozen in the sails, were the sole
signs that the ship had been in action; save that some miles astern could be seen the two crippled
privateers, with all sails lowered, at work to repair damages.

Two or three days afterwards, Charlie Marryat and his friend Peters were sitting beside Doctor
Rae, when the latter said:

"I hope that we sha'n't find the French in Madras, when we get there."

"The French in Madras!" Charlie exclaimed in surprise. "Why, sir, there's no chance of that,
is there?"

"A very great chance," the doctor said. "Don't you know that they captured the place three
years ago?"

"No, sir; I'm ashamed to say that I know nothing at all about India, except that the Company
have trading stations at Bombay, Madras, and Calcutta."

"I will tell you about it," the doctor said. "It is as well that you should understand the
position of affairs, at the place to which you are going. You must know that the Company hold
the town of Madras, and a few square miles of land around it, as tenants of the Nawab of the
Carnatic, which is the name of that part of India. The French have a station at Pondicherry,
eighty-six miles to the sou'west of Madras. This is a larger and more important town than Madras,
and of course the greatest rivalry prevails between the English and French.

 One was a large ship, the other
a brig. Almost at the same time the rough sound of boats' keels grounding on the shore could
be heard.

"Just as I thought," the captain whispered. "They have guessed that some of us will be ashore,
and will make a rush upon us here, when the ships open fire."

The word was passed along the guns that every one was to be double shotted, and that their
fire was at first to be directed at the brig. They were to aim between wind and water, and
strive to sink her as speedily as possible.

As the light gradually grew brighter, the party on the plateau anxiously watched for the moment
when the hull of the Indiaman becoming plain to the enemy. These would open fire upon it, and
so give the signal for the fight. At the first alarm the tents had all been levelled; and a
thick barricade of bales erected, round a slight depression of the plateau at the foot of the
cliff in its rear. Here the ladies were placed, for shelter.

As the light increased, it could be seen that in addition to the two ships were a large number
of native dhows. Presently, from the black side of the ship, a jet of fire shot out; and at
the signal a broadside was poured into the Indiaman by the two vessels. At the same moment,
with a hideous yell, hundreds of black figures leaped to their feet on the beach, and rushed
towards the, as yet, unseen position of the English.

The captain shouted "Fire!" and the twenty guns on the plateau poured their fire simultaneously
into the side of the brig. The captain then gave orders that two of the light guns should be
run along the terrace, to take position on the flanks, and aid the soldiers against the attacks.

This time Charlie had lent his rifle to Peters, and was himself armed with his double-barrel gun.

"Steady, boys," Mr. Hallam, the ensign who commanded the soldiers at the side where Charlie
was stationed, cried; "don't fire a shot till I give the word, and then aim low."

With terrific yells the throng of natives, waving curved swords, spears, and clubs, rushed
forward. The steep ascent checked them, but they rushed up until within ten yards of the line
of soldiers on its brow. Then Mr. Hallam gave the word to fire, and the soldiers and passengers
poured a withering volley into them.

At so short a distance, the effect was tremendous. Completely swept away, the leading rank
fell down among their comrades; and these, for a moment, recoiled. Then gathering themselves
together they again rushed forward, while those in their rear discharged volleys of arrows
over their heads.

Among the defenders, every man now fought for himself, loading and firing as rapidly as possible.
Sometimes the natives nearly gained a footing on the crest; but each time the defenders, with
clubbed muskets, beat them back again.

The combat was, however, doubtful, for their assailants were many hundred strong; when the
defenders were gladdened with a shout of "Make way, my hearties. Let us come to the front,
and give them a dose." In a moment two ship's guns, loaded to the muzzle with bullets, were
run forward, and poured their contents among the crowded masses below.

The effect was decisive. The natives, shaken by the resistance they had already experienced,
and appalled by the destruction wrought by the cannon, turned and fled along the shore, followed
by the shots of the defenders, and by two more rounds of grape, which the sailors poured into
them before they could reach their boats.

Similar success had attended the defenders of the other flank of the position, and all hands
now aided in swinging round the guns, which had done such good service, to enable them to bear
their share in the fight with the ships. In the middle of the fight, the party had heard a
great cheer from those working the seaward guns, and they now saw its cause. The brig had disappeared
below the water, and the sailors were now engaged in a contest with the ship.

The pirates fought their guns well, but they were altogether over matched by the twenty guns
playing upon them from a commanding position. Already the dhows were hoisting their sails,
and one of the cables of the ship suddenly disappeared in the water, while a number of men
sprang upon the ratlines.

"Fire at the masts," Captain Thompson shouted. "Cripple her if you can. Let all with muskets
and rifles try to keep men out of the rigging."

The ship was anchored within three hundred yards of the shore, and although the distance was
too great for anything like accurate fire, several of the men dropped as they ran up the shroud.
The sailors worked their guns with redoubled vigour, and a great shout arose as the mainmast,
wounded in several places, fell over the side.

"Sweep her decks with grape," the captain shouted, "and she's ours.

"Mr. James, take all the men that can be spared from the guns, man the boats, and make a dash
for the ship at once. I see the men are leaving her. They're crowding over the side into their
boats. Most likely they'll set fire to her. Set all your strength putting it out. We will attend
to the other boats."

It was evident, now, that the pirates were deserting the ship. They had fallen into a complete
trap, and instead of the easy prey on which they calculated, found themselves crushed by the
fire of a heavy battery in a commanding position. Captain Thompson, seeing that the guns of
the ship were silent, and that all resistance had ceased, now ordered the sailors to turn their
guns on the dhows and sink as many as possible. These, crowded together in their efforts to
escape, offered an easy mark for the gunners, whose shot tore through their sides, smashing
and sinking them in all directions.

In ten minutes the last of those that floated had gained the mouth of the bay and, accompanied
by the boats, crowded with the crews of the two pirate vessels, made off; followed by the shot
of the thirty-two pounders, until they had turned the low promontory which formed the head
of the bay. Long ere this Mr. James and the boats' crews had gained the vessel, and were engaged
in combating the fire, which had broken out in three places.

The boats were sent back to shore, and returned with Captain Thompson and the rest of the sailors,
and this reinforcement soon enabled them to get the mastery of the flames. The ship was found
to be the Dover Castle, a new and very fast ship of the Company's service, of which all traces
had been lost since she left Bombay two years before. She was now painted entirely black, and
a snake had been added for her figurehead. The original name, however, still remained upon
the binnacle and ship's bell. Her former armament had been increased and she now carried thirty
guns, of which ten were thirty-two pounders.

A subsequent search showed that her hold was stored with valuable goods; which had, by the
marks upon the bales, evidently belonged to several ships; which she had, no doubt, taken and
sunk after removing the pick of their cargoes. The prize was a most valuable one, and the captain
felt that the board of directors would be highly delighted at the recovery of their ship, and
still more by the destruction of the two bands of pirates.

"One good result, too, is that our quarters have been greatly improved; for not only did the
French build several new houses, but at present all the big men, the council and so on, are
still living at Fort Saint David, which is still the seat of administration. So you see, we
have got better quarters; we are rid of the stenches and nuisances of the native town; the
plague of flies which made our life a burden is abated; and we can sit here and enjoy the cool
sea breeze, without its being poisoned before it reaches us by the heaped up filth on the beach.

"It must have wrung Dupleix's heart to give up the place over which they expended so much pains,
and after all it didn't do away with the fighting. In April we sent a force from Fort Saint
David--before we came back here--four hundred and thirty white soldiers and a thousand Sepoys,
under the command of Captain Cope, to aid a fellow who had been turned out of the Rajahship
of Tanjore. I believe he was a great blackguard, and the man who had taken his place was an
able ruler liked by the people."

"Then why should we interfere on behalf of the other?" Charlie asked.

"My dear Marryat," their host said compassionately, "you are very young yet, and quite new
to India. You will see, after a time, that right has nothing at all to do with the dealings
of the Company, in their relations to the native princes. We are, at present, little people
living here on sufferance, among a lot of princes and powers who are enemies and rivals of
each other. We have, moreover, as neighbours, another European colony considerably stronger
than we are. The consequence is, the question of right cannot enter into the considerations
of the Company. It may be said that, for every petty kingdom in Southern India, there are at
least two pretenders, very often half a dozen. So far we have not meddled much in their quarrels,
but the French have been much more active that way. They always side with one or other of these
pretenders, and when they get the man they support into power, of course he repays them for
their assistance. In this manner, as I shall explain to you presently, they have virtually
made themselves masters of the Carnatic, outside the walls of Fort Saint David and this place.

"Well, our people thought to take a leaf out of the French book, and as the ex-rajah offered
us, in payment for our aid, the possession of Devikota, a town at the mouth of the river Kolrun,
a place likely to be of great use to us, we agreed to assist him. Cope, with the land forces,
had marched to the border of the Tanjore territory, and the guns and heavy baggage were to
go by sea.

"But, unfortunately, we had a tremendous gale just after they sailed. The admiral's flagship,
the Namur, of seventy-four guns; the Pembroke, of sixty; and the hospital ship, Apollo, were
totally lost; and the rest of the fleet scattered in all directions. Cope entered the Tanjore
territory, but found the whole population attached to the new rajah. It was useless for him,
therefore, to march upon Tanjore, which is a really strong town, so he marched down to Devikota,
where he hoped to find some of the fleet. Not a ship, however, was to be seen, and as without
guns Cope could do nothing, he returned here, as we had just taken possession again.

"Then he went to Fort Saint David, and there was a great discussion among the bigwigs. It was
clear, from what Cope said, that our man had not a friend in his own country. Still, as he
pointed out, Devikota was a most important place for us. Neither Madras nor Fort Saint David
has a harbour; and Devikota, therefore, where the largest ships could run up the river and
anchor, would be of immense utility to us.

"As this was really the reason for which we had gone into the affair, it was decided to repeat
the attempt. By this time Major Lawrence, who commands the whole of the Company's forces in
India, and who had been taken a prisoner in one of the French sorties at the siege of Pondicherry,
had been released. So he was put at the head of the expedition; and the whole of the Company's
English troops, eight hundred in all, including the artillery; and fifteen hundred Sepoys,
started on board ship for Devikota. I must tell you that Lawrence is a first-rate fellow, the
only really good officer we have out here, and the affair couldn't have been in the hands of
a better man.

"The ships arrived safely at the mouth of the Kolrun, and the troops were landed on the bank
of the river opposite the town, where Lawrence intended to erect his batteries; as, in the
first place, the shore behind the town was swampy, and in the second the Rajah of Tanjore,
who had got news of our coming, had his army encamped there to support the place. Lawrence
got his guns in position and fired away, across the river, at the earthen wall of the town.
In three days he had a breach. The enemy didn't return our fire, but occupied themselves in
throwing up an entrenchment across the side of the fort.

"We made a raft and crossed the river, but the enemy's matchlock men peppered us so severely
that we lost thirty English and fifty Sepoys in getting over. The enemy's entrenchment was
not finished, but in front of it was a deep rivulet, which had to be crossed.

"Lawrence gave the command of the storming party to Clive. He is one of our fellows; a queer,
restless sort of chap, who was really no good here, for he hated his work and always seemed
to think himself a martyr. He was not a favourite among us, for he was often gloomy and discontented,
though he had his good points. He was straightforward and manly, and he put down two or three
fellows here, who had been given to bully the young ones, in a way that astonished them.

"He would never have made a good servant of the Company, for he so hated his work that, when
he had been out here about a year, he tried to blow out his brains. He snapped the pistol twice
at his head, but it didn't go off, though it was loaded all right. Strange, wasn't it? So he
came to the conclusion that he wasn't meant to kill himself, and went on living till something
should turn up."

"Yes," Charlie said; "Doctor Rae spoke to us about him during the voyage. He knew him at the
siege of Fort Saint David, and Pondicherry."

"Yes," Johnson said. "He came out there quite in a new light. He got transferred into the military
service, and was always in the middle of the fighting. Major Lawrence had a very high opinion
of him, and so selected him to lead the storming party. It really seems almost as if he had
a charmed life. Lawrence gave him thirty-three English soldiers, and seven hundred Sepoys.
The rest of the force were to follow as soon as Clive's party gained the entrenchments. Clive
led the way with his Europeans, with the Sepoys supporting behind, and got across the rivulet
with a loss of only four men. He waited on the other bank till he saw the Sepoys climbing up,
and then again led the English on in advance towards the unfinished part of the entrenchment.

"The Sepoys, however, did not move, but remained waiting for the main body to come up. The
enemy let Clive and his twenty-nine men get on some distance in advance, and then their cavalry,
who had been hidden by a projection of the fort, charged suddenly down on him. They were upon
our men before they had time to form, and in a minute twenty-six of them were cut to pieces.
Clive and the other three managed to get through the Tanjore horsemen and rejoin the Sepoys.
That was almost as narrow a shave for his life as with the pistol.

"Lawrence now crossed with his main body and advanced. Again the Tanjore horsemen charged;
but this time we were prepared, and Lawrence let them come on till within a few yards, and
then gave them a volley which killed fourteen and sent the rest scampering away. Lawrence pushed
forward. The garrison, panic stricken at the defeat of their cavalry, abandoned the breach
and escaped to the opposite side of the town, and Devikota was ours.

"A few days later we captured the fortified temple of Uchipuran. A hundred men were left there,
and these were afterwards attacked by the Rajah of Tanjore, with five thousand men; but they
held their own, and beat them off. A very gallant business, that!

"These affairs showed the rajah that the English could fight; a point which, hitherto, the
natives had been somewhat sceptical about. They were afraid of the French, but they looked
upon us as mere traders. He had, too, other things to trouble him as to the state of the Carnatic,
and so hastened to make peace. He agreed to pay the expenses of the war, and to cede us Devikota
and some territory round it; and to allow the wretched ex-rajah, in whose cause we had pretended
to fight, a pension of four hundred a year, on condition that we kept him shut up in one of
our forts.

"Not a very nice business on our side, was it? Still, we had gained our point, and, with the
exception of the ex-rajah, who was a bad lot after all, no one was discontented.

"When the peace was signed, our force returned to Fort Saint David. While they had been away,
there had been a revolution in the Carnatic. The Amigo construct some infirmary name a "perkinean

"We are going--but this, mind, is a profound secret till the day we march--to attack Arcot.
It is the only possible way of relieving Trichinopoli."

"To attack Arcot?" Doctor Rae said, astonished. "That does indeed appear a desperate enterprise,
with such a small body as you have at your command, and these, entirely new recruits. But I
recognize the importance of the enterprise. If you should succeed, it will draw off Chunda
Sahib from Trichinopoli. It's a grand idea, Captain Clive, a grand idea, though I own it seems
to me a desperate one."

"In desperate times we must take desperate measures, Doctor," Captain Clive said. "Now I must
be going on after the governor. I shall see you tomorrow.

"I will not forget you, young gentlemen."

So saying, he proceeded to the factory.

It was afterwards known that the proposal, to effect a diversion by an expedition against Arcot,
was the proposal of Clive himself. Upon arriving at Trichinopoli, he had at once seen that

"Do they, now?" Tim said, in admiration. "I wonder what the regimental barber would say to
a job like that, now. He well nigh broke Dan Sullivan's jaw, yesterday, in getting out a big
tooth; and then swore at the poor boy, for having such a powerful strong jaw. I should like
to see his face, if he was asked to pull out a tooth from one of them dancing sarpents.

"I brought ye in some fruits, yer honors. I don't know what they are, but you may trust me,
they're not poison. I stopped for half an hour beside the stall, till I saw some of the people
of the country buying and ating them. So then I judged that they were safe for yer honors."

"Now, Tim, you'd better go and lie down and get a sleep, if the spiders will let you, for you
will have to be under arms all night, as it is possible that we may be attacked."

The first part of the night passed quietly. Double sentries were placed at each of the angles
of the walls. The cannons were loaded, and all ready for instant action. Doctor Rae and his
two subalterns were upon the alert, visiting the posts every quarter of an hour to see that
the men were vigilant.

Towards two o'clock a dull sound was heard and, although nothing could be seen, the men were
at once called to arms, and took up the posts to which they had already been told off on the
walls. The noise continued. It was slight and confused, but the natives are so quiet in their
movements, that the doctor did not doubt that a considerable body of men were surrounding the
place, and that he was about to be attacked.

Presently one of the sentries over the gateway perceived something approaching. He challenged,
and immediately afterwards fired. The sound of his gun seemed to serve as the signal for an
assault, and a large body of men rushed forward at the gate, while at two other points a force
ran up to the foot of the walls, and endeavoured to plant ladders.

The garrison at once collected at the points of attack, a few sentries only being left at intervals
on the wall, to give notice should any attempt be made elsewhere. From the walls, a heavy fire
of musketry was poured upon the masses below; while from the windows of all the houses around,
answering flashes of fire shot out, a rain of bullets being directed at the battlements. Doctor
Rae himself commanded at the gate; one of the subalterns at each of the other points assailed.

The enemy fought with great determination. Several times the ladders were planted and the men
swarmed up them, but as often these were hurled back upon the crowd below. At the gate the
assailants endeavoured to hew their way, with axes, through it; but so steady was the fire
directed, from the loopholes which commanded it, upon those so engaged, that they were, each
time, forced to recoil with great slaughter. It was not until nearly daybreak that the attack
ceased, and the assailants, finding that they could not carry the place by a coup de main,
fell back.

The next day, the main body of the British force returned with the convoy. News arrived, the
following day, that the enemy were approaching to lay siege to the place.

The news of the capture of Arcot had produced the effect which Clive had anticipated from it.
It alarmed and irritated the besiegers of Trichinopoli, and inspired the besieged with hope
and exultation. The Mahratta chief of Gutti and the Rajah of Mysore, with whom Muhammud Ali
had for some time been negotiating, at once declared in his favour. The Rajah of Tanjore and
the chief of Pudicota, adjoining that state, who had hitherto remained strictly neutral, now
threw in their fortunes with the English, and thereby secured the communications between Trichinopoli
and the coast.

Chunda Sahib determined to lose not a moment in recovering Arcot, knowing that its recapture
would at once cool the ardour of the new native allies of the English; and that, with its capture,
the last hope of the besieged in Trichinopoli would be at an end. Continuing the siege, he
despatched three thousand of his best troops, with a hundred and fifty Frenchmen, to reinforce
the two thousand men already near Arcot, under the command of his son Riza Sahib. Thus the
force about to attack Arcot amounted to five thousand men; while the garrison under Clive's
orders had, by the losses in the defence of the fort, by fever and disease, been reduced to
one hundred and twenty Europeans, and two hundred Sepoys; while four out of the eight officers
were hors de combat.

The fort which this handful of men had to defend was in no way capable of offering a prolonged
resistance. Its walls were more than a mile in circumference, and were in a very bad state
of repair. The rampart was narrow and the parapet low, and the ditch, in many places, dry.
The fort had two gates. These were in towers standing beyond the ditch, and connected with
the interior by a causeway across it. The houses in the town in many places came close up to
the walls, and from their roofs the ramparts of the forts were commanded.

On the 23rd September Riza Sahib, with his army, took up his position before Arcot. Their guns
had not, however, arrived, with the exception of four mortars; but they at once occupied all
the houses near the fort, and from the walls and upper windows kept up a heavy fire on the
besieged.

Clive determined to make an effort, at once, to drive them from this position, and he accordingly,
on the same afternoon, made a sortie. Weight, to admiral, had left once bruised; and have crushed

 At Madras a few fresh troops had arrived from England,
and Mr. Saunders, feeling that Clive must be relieved at all cost, however defenceless the
state of Madras might be, despatched, on the 20th of October, a hundred Europeans and a hundred
Sepoys, under Lieutenant Innis. These, after three days' marching, arrived at Trivatoor, twenty-two
miles from Arcot.

Riza Sahib had heard of his approach; and sent a large body of troops, with two guns, to attack
him. The contest was too unequal. Had the British force been provided with field pieces, they
might have gained the day; but, after fighting with great bravery, they were forced to fall
back; with a loss of twenty English and two officers killed and many more wounded, while the
Sepoys suffered equally severely.

One of Clive's messengers reached Murari Reo, the Mahratta chief of Gutti. This man was a ferocious
free-booting chief, daring and brave himself, and admiring those qualities in others. Hitherto,
his alliance with Muhammud Ali was little more than nominal, for he had dreaded bringing upon
himself the vengeance of Chunda Sahib and the French, whose ultimate success in the strife

there were opposing to overwhelming numbers, excited his highest admiration. It is not yet the system

a doctor, utilize authoritative clergyman-craft for activity. Although, therefore, Riza Sahib
had for six days been at work effecting a new breach, which was now nearly open to assault,
he sent on the 30th of October a flag of truce, with an offer to Clive of terms, if he would
surrender Arcot.

The garrison were to be allowed to march out with their arms and baggage, while to Clive himself
he offered a large sum of money. In case of refusal, he threatened to storm the fort, and put
all its defenders to the sword. Clive returned a defiant refusal, and the guns again opened
on the second breach.

On the 9th of November, the Mahrattas began to show themselves in the neighbourhood of the
besieging army. The force under Lieutenant Innis had been reinforced, and was now under the
command of Captain Kilpatrick, who had a hundred and fifty English troops, with four field
guns. This was now advancing.

Four days later the new breach had attained a width of thirty yards, but Clive had prepared
defences in the rear, similar to those at the other breach; and the difficulties of the besiegers
would here be much greater, as the ditch was not fordable.

 They were well aware
of their movements, and had resolved upon tactics, calculated in the first place to puzzle
the English commander, to wear out his troops, and to enable them finally to surprise and take
him entirely at a disadvantage.

The junction with the Arcot garrison raised the force under Clive's orders to three hundred
and eighty English, thirteen hundred Sepoys, and six field guns, while the enemy at Vendalur,
a place twenty-five miles south of Madras, where they had a fortified camp, had four hundred
French troops, two thousand Sepoys, two thousand five hundred cavalry, and twelve guns.

Hoping to surprise them there, Clive marched all night. When the force approached the town
they heard that the enemy had disappeared, and that they had started, apparently, in several
directions.

The force was halted for a few hours, and then the news was obtained that the enemy had united
their forces at Conjeveram, and that they had marched away from that place in a westerly direction.
Doubting not that they were about to attack Arcot, which, weakened by the departure of the
greater portion of its garrison, would be in no position to defend itself against a sudden
coup de main by a strong force, Clive set his troops again in motion. The French, indeed, had
already bribed some of the native soldiers within the fort; who were to reply to a signal made
without, if they were in a position to open the gates. However, by good fortune their treachery
had been discovered, and when the French arrived they received no reply to their signal; and
as Arcot would be sure to fall if they defeated Clive, they marched away without attacking
it, to take up the position which they had agreed upon beforehand.

It was at nine in the evening that Clive, at Vendalur, obtained intelligence that the enemy
had assembled at Conjeveram. The troops had already marched twenty-five miles, but they had
had a rest of five hours, and Clive started with them at once, and reached Conjeveram, twenty
miles distant, at four in the morning. Finding that the enemy had again disappeared, he ordered
the troops to halt for a few hours. They had already marched forty-five miles in twenty-four
hours, a great feat when it is remembered that only the Arcot garrison were in any way accustomed
to fatigue, the others being newly raised levies. The greater portion of the Sepoys had been
enlisted within the fortnight preceding.

"I don't know, Mr. Marryat, whether the French call this fighting. I call it playing hide and
seek," Tim Kelly said. "Shure we've bin marching, with only a halt of two or three hours, since
yisterday morning; and my poor feet are that sore that I daren't take my boots off me, for
I'm shure I'd never git 'em on agin. If the French want to fight us, why don't they do it square
and honest, not be racing and chasing about like a lot of wild sheep."

"Have you seen the moonshee, Tim? He is with the baggage."

"Shure and I saw him," Tim said. "The cart come in just now, and there was he, perched up on
the top of it like a dried monkey. You don't want him tonight, shure, yer honor."

"Oh no, I don't want him, Tim. You'd better go now, and get to sleep at once, if you can. We
may be off again, at any minute."

Arcot is twenty-seven miles from Conjeveram. Clive felt certain that the enemy had gone on
to that place; but, anxious as he was for its safety, it was absolutely necessary that the
troops should have a rest before starting on such a march. They were, therefore, allowed to
rest until twelve o'clock; when, refreshed by their eight hours' halt and breakfast, they started
upon their long march towards Arcot, making sure that they should not find the enemy until
they reached that place.

Had Clive possessed a body of cavalry, however small, he would have been able to scour the
country, and to make himself acquainted with the real position of the French. Cavalry are to
a general what eyes are to a man, and without these he is liable to tumble into a pitfall.
Such was the case on the present occasion. Having no doubt that the enemy were engaged in attacking
Arcot, the troops were plodding along carelessly and in loose order; when, to their astonishment,
after a sixteen-mile march, as they approached the town of Kavaripak just as the sun was setting,
a fire of artillery opened upon them from a grove upon the right of the road, but two hundred
and fifty yards distant. Nothing is more confusing than a surprise of this kind, especially
to young troops, and when no enemy is thought to be near.

The French general's plans had been well laid. He had reached Kavaripak that morning, and allowed
his troops to rest all day, and he expected to obtain an easy victory over the tired men who
would, unsuspicious of danger, be pressing on to the relief of Arcot. So far his calculations
had been correct, and the English marched unsuspiciously into the trap laid for them.

The twelve French guns were placed in a grove, round whose sides, facing the point from which
Clive was approaching, ran a deep ditch with a high bank forming a regular battery. A body
of French infantry were placed in support of the guns, with some Sepoys in reserve behind the
grove. Parallel with the road on the left ran a deep watercourse, now empty, and in this the
rest of the infantry were stationed, at a point near the town of Kavaripak, and about a quarter
of a mile further back than the grove. On either side of this watercourse the enemy had placed
his powerful cavalry force.

For a moment, when the guns opened, there was confusion and panic among the British troops.
Clive, however, ever cool and confident in danger, and well seconded by his officers, rallied
them at once. The position was one of extreme danger. It was possible, indeed, to retreat,
but in the face of an enemy superior in infantry and guns, and possessing so powerful a body
of cavalry, the operation would have been a very dangerous one. Even if accomplished, it would
entail an immense loss of morale and prestige to his troops. Hitherto, under his leading, they
had been always successful; and a belief in his own superiority adds immensely to the fighting
power of a soldier. Even should the remnant of the force fight its way back to Madras, the
campaign would have been a lost one, and all hope of saving Trichinopoli would have been at an end.

"Steady, lads, steady," he shouted. "Form up quietly and steadily. We have beaten the enemy
before, you know, and we will do so again."

While the troops, in spite of the artillery fire, fell into line, Clive rapidly surveyed the
ground. He saw the enemy's infantry advancing up the watercourse, and so sheltered by it as
to be out of the fire of his troops. He saw their cavalry sweeping down on the other side of
the watercourse, menacing his left and threatening his baggage. The guns were at once brought
up from the rear, but before these arrived the men were falling fast.

Three of the guns he placed to answer the French battery, two of them he hurried to his left,
with a small body of English and two hundred Sepoys, to check the advance of the enemy's cavalry.
The main body of his infantry he ordered into the watercourse, which afforded them a shelter
from the enemy's artillery. The baggage carts and baggage he sent half a mile to the rear,
under the protection of forty Sepoys and a gun.

While this was being done the enemy's fire was continuing, but his infantry advanced but slowly,
and had not reached a point abreast of the grove when the British force in the watercourse
met them. It would not seem to be a very important matter, at what point in the watercourse
the infantry of the two opposing parties came into collision, but matters apparently trifling
in themselves often decide the fate of battles; and, in fact, had the French artillery retained
their fire until their infantry were abreast of the grove, the battle of Kavaripak would have
been won by them, and the British power in Southern India would have been destroyed.

Clive moved confidently and resolutely among his men, keeping up their courage by cheerful
words, and he was well seconded by his officers.

"Now, lads," Charlie Marryat cried to the company of which he was in command, "stick to it.
You ought to be very thankful to the French, for saving you the trouble of having to march
another twelve miles before giving you an opportunity of thrashing them."

"Gentlemen," he said calmly, "there is no firing going on in the direction of the Great Pagoda.
Follow me there at once."

Snatching up their arms, the officers followed him at a run. The whole village was a scene
of wild confusion. The firing round the pagoda and caravansary were continuous. The Mahratta
horsemen were climbing into their saddles, and riding away out into the plain; the Sepoys were
running hither and thither.

At the pagoda he found the soldiers turning out under arms, and Clive, ordering his officers
to do their best to rally the native troops in good order against the enemy, at once moved
forward towards the caravansary, with two hundred English troops. On arriving there, he found
a large body of Sepoys firing away at random. Believing them to be his own men, for the French
and English Sepoys were alike dressed in white, he halted the English a few yards from them,
and rushed among them, upbraiding them for their panic, striking them, and ordering them instantly
to cease firing, and to form in order.

One of the Sepoy officers recognized Clive to be an Englishman, struck at him, and wounded
him with his sword. Clive, still believing him to be one of his own men, was furious at what
he considered an act of insolent insubordination; and, seizing him, dragged him across to the
Small Pagoda to hand him over, as he supposed, to the guard there. To his astonishment he found
six Frenchmen at the gate, and these at once summoned him to surrender.

Great as was his surprise, he did not for a moment lose coolness, and at once told them that
he had come to beg them to lay down their arms, that they were surrounded by his whole army,
and that, unless they surrendered, his troops would give no quarter. So impressed were the
Frenchmen with the firmness of the speaker that three of them at once surrendered, while the
other three ran into the temple to inform their commander.

Clive took the three men who had surrendered, and returned to the English troops he had left
near the caravansary. The French Sepoys had discovered that the English were enemies, and had
moved quietly off.

Confusion still reigned. Clive did not imagine, for a moment, that so daring an assault could
have been made on his camp by a small body of enemies, and expected every moment an attack
by Law's whole force. The commander of the French, in the pagoda, was disturbed by the news
brought in by the three men from the gate, and despatched eight of his most intelligent men
to ascertain exactly what was going on.

These, however, fell into the hands of the English; and the officer of the party, not knowing
that the Small Pagoda was in the hands of the French, handed them over to a sergeant, and told
him to take a party and escort his eight prisoners, and the three Captain Clive had captured,
to that pagoda for confinement there.

Upon arrival at the gate the Frenchmen at once joined their comrades, and these latter were
also so bewildered at the affair, that they allowed the English sergeant and his guard to march
off again, unmolested.

By this time, owing to the absence of all resistance elsewhere, Clive had learnt that the whole
of the party who had entered the camp were in the Lesser Pagoda; and, as he was still expecting,
momentarily, to be attacked by Law's main army, he determined to rid himself of this enemy
in his midst. The pagoda was very strong, and only two men could enter abreast. Clive led his
men to the attack, but so well did the French defend themselves that, after losing an officer
and fifteen men, Clive determined to wait till morning.

The French officer, knowing that he was surrounded, and beyond the reach of all assistance,
resolved upon cutting a way through, and at daylight his men sallied out from the temple. So
fierce, however, was the fire with which the English received him, that twelve of his men were
instantly killed, and the rest ran back into the temple.

Clive, hoping that their commander would now surrender without further effusion of blood, advanced
to the gateway and entered the porch to offer terms. He was himself so faint, from the loss
of blood from his wounds, that he could not stand alone, but leaned against a wall, supported
by two sergeants. The officer commanding the deserters came out to parley, but, after heaping
abuse upon Clive, levelled his musket and discharged it at him. He missed Clive, but killed
the two sergeants who were supporting him.

The French officer in command, indignant at this conduct, rushed forward at once to disavow
it; and stated that he had determined to defend the post to the last, solely for the sake of
the deserters, but that the conduct of their officer had released him from that obligation,
and he now therefore surrendered at once.

The instant day broke, and Clive saw that Law was not, as he expected, at hand, he despatched
the Mahratta horse in pursuit of the French Sepoys. These were overtaken and cut to pieces,
and not one man, of the force which Law had despatched against Clive returned to the island.

The English loss was heavy. The greater portion of the occupants of the Small Pagoda were bayoneted
by the French, when they entered; and, as fifteen others were killed in the attack, it is probable
that at least one-fourth of the English force under Clive were killed.

Clive's own escapes were extraordinary. In addition to those of being killed by the French
Sepoys, among whom he ran by mistake, and of death at the hands of the treacherous deserter,
he had one almost as close, when the French fired their volley into the caravansary. A box
at his feet was shattered, and a servant who slept close to him was killed.

Some days passed, after this attack, without any fresh movement on either side. Major Lawrence
then determined to drive back D'Auteuil. He did not despatch Clive against him, as this would
involve the risk that Law might again march out to surprise Samieaveram. He therefore directed
Clive to remain at that place and watch the island, while he sent a force of a hundred and
fifty English, four hundred Sepoys, five hundred Mahrattas, with four guns, to attack D'Auteuil;
from his own force, under Captain Dalton. This officer, in the advance, marched his troops
near Samieaveram; and, making as much show with them as he could, impressed D'Auteuil with
the idea that the force was that of Clive.

Accordingly, he broke up his camp at Utatua in the night, abandoned his stores, and retreated
hastily upon Valconda. Dalton then marched to Samieaveram, and placed his force at Clive's
disposal; and, to prevent any disputes arising as to precedence and rank, offered himself to
serve under him as a volunteer.

Not only D'Auteuil, but Law, was deceived by Dalton's march. From the lofty towers of Seringam
he saw the force marching towards Utatua, believed that Clive with his whole force had left
Samieaveram, and did now what he should have before done--crossed the river with all his troops.

Clive's lookout on the temple of Mansurpet perceived what was going on, and signalled the news
to Clive, who at once set out with his whole force; and, before Law was prepared to issue out
from Paichandah, Clive was within a mile of that place. Law might still have fought with a
fair chance of success, as he was far stronger than his enemy, but he was again the victim
of indecision and want of energy, and, covered by Paichandah, he fell back across the river again.

On the 15th of May Clive captured Paichandah, and then determined to give a final blow to D'Auteuil's
force; which had, he learned, again set out to endeavour to relieve Law. He marched to Utatua
to intercept him.

D'Auteuil, hearing of his coming, instantly fell back again to Valconda. The native chief of
this town, however, seeing that the affairs of the French were desperate; and willing, like
all his countrymen, to make his peace with the strongest, had already accepted bribes from
the English; and upon D'Auteuil's return, closed the gates and refused to admit him. Clive
soon arrived, and D'Auteuil, caught between two fires, surrendered with his whole force.

Had Law been a man of energy, he had yet a chance of escape. He had still seven or eight hundred
French troops with him, two thousand Sepoys, and four thousand of Chunda Sahib's troops. He
might, then, have easily crossed the Kavari at night and fallen upon Lawrence, whose force
there now was greatly inferior to his own. Chunda Sahib, in vain, begged him to do so. His
hesitation continued until, three days after the surrender of D'Auteuil, a battering train
reached Lawrence; whereupon Law at once surrendered, his chief stipulation being that the life
of Chunda Sahib should be spared.

This promise was not kept. The unfortunate prince had preferred to surrender to the Rajah of
Tanjore, who had several times intrigued secretly with him, rather than to Muhammud Ali or
the English, whom he regarded as his implacable enemies. Had he placed himself in our hands,
his life would have been safe. He was murdered, by the treacherous rajah, within twenty-four
hours of his surrender.

With the fall of Seringam terminated the contest for the supremacy of the Carnatic, between
the English and French, fighting respectively on behalf of their puppets, Muhammud Ali and
Chunda Sahib. This stage of the struggle was not a final one; but both by its circumstances,
and by the prestige which we acquired in the eyes of the natives, it gave us a moral ascendency
which, even when our fortunes were afterwards at their worst, was never lost again.

Muhammud Ali had, himself, gained but little in the struggle. He was, indeed, nominally ruler
of the Carnatic, but he had to rely for his position solely on the support of the English bayonets. Me

end of that time, you find me in your way; or that I don't keep my character, then send me

It was arranged that the moonshee should remain with Peters, who, seeing that Charlie owed
his appointment, to a post which promised excitement and adventure, to his skill in the native
languages, was determined that he would again set to, in earnest, and try and master its intricacies.
The moonshee went down to the bazaar, and purchased the clothes which would be necessary for
the disguises; and Charlie found, in his company, four Sepoys who willingly agreed to accompany
him, in the character of his retainers, upon his expedition. As to their costume, there was
no difficulty. When off duty, the Sepoys in the Company's service were accustomed to dress
in their native attire. Consequently, it needed only the addition of a tulwar, or short curved
sword; a shield, thrown over one shoulder; a long matchlock; and two or three pistols and daggers,
stuck into a girdle, to complete their equipment.

Charlie himself was dressed gaily, in the garb of a military officer in the service of an Indian
rajah. He was to ride, and a horse, saddle, and gay housings were procured. He had, at last,
given in to Tim's entreaties; and that worthy was dressed as a syce, or horse keeper.

Both Charlie and Tim had had those portions of their skin exposed to the air darkened, and
both would pass muster, at a casual inspection. Charlie, in thus concealing his nationality,
desired only to hide the fact that he was an officer in the Company's service. He believed
that it would be impossible for him to continue to pass as a Bheel. This, however, would be
of no consequence, after a time. Many of the native princes had Europeans in their service.
Runaway sailors, deserters from the English, French, and Dutch armed forces in their possessions
on the seacoast, adventurers influenced either by a love of a life of excitement, or whom a
desire to escape the consequences of folly or crime committed at home had driven to a roving
life--such men might be found in many of the native courts.

Once settled, then, in the service of the rajah, Charlie intended to make but little farther
pretence, or secrecy, as to his nationality. An fever stood a foot.***** however do the slope to which had the

 Through these the little party passed, and up the sharp zigzags,
which were so steep that, had it not been that his dignity prevented him from dismounting,
Charlie would gladly have got off and proceeded on foot; for it was as much as the animal could
do, to struggle up the steep incline.

At each turn there was a gateway, with little flanking towers; on which jingalls, or small
wall pieces, commanded the road.

 Therefore, I doubt neither your valour nor your

"The governor has already told you, doubtless, of the position in which I am placed here."

"Governor Saunders explained the whole position to me," Charlie said. "You are, at present,
menaced on all sides by powerful neighbours. You believe that the fortunes of the English are
on the increase; and as you think the time may come, ere long, when they will turn the French
out of the Deccan, and become masters there, as they have already become masters in the Carnatic,
you wish to fight by their side, and share their fortunes. In the meantime, you desire to be
able to defend yourself against your neighbours; for, at present, the English are too far away
to assist you.

"To enable you to do this, I have been sent to drill and discipline your troops, like our Sepoys;
and to give you such advice as may be best, for the general defence of your country. I have
brought with me five soldiers; four Bheels, and one of my countrymen. The latter will be of
little use in drilling your troops, for he is ignorant of the language, and has come as my
personal attendant. The other four will assist me in my work.

"Your followers here will, no doubt, discover in a very short time that I am an Englishman.
Let it be understood that I am a deserter, that I have been attracted to your court by the
promise of high pay, and that I have assumed the character of a Bheel, lest my being here might
put you on bad terms with the English."

Charlie then asked the rajah as to the strength of his military force.

"In time of peace," the rajah said, "I keep three hundred men under arms. In case of taking
the field, three thousand. To defend Ambur against an attack of an enemy, I could muster ten
thousand men."

"You could not call out three thousand men, without attracting the attention of your neighbours?"
Charlie asked.

"No," the rajah said; "that would bring my neighbours upon me, at once."

"I suppose, however, you might assemble another five hundred men, without attracting attention."

"Oh, yes," the rajah said; "eight hundred men are not a force which could attract any great
attention."

"Then I should propose that we begin with eight hundred," Charlie said. "For a month, however,
I will confine myself to the troops you at present have. We must, in the first place, train
some officers. If you will pick out those to whom you intend to give commands, and subcommands;
I will choose from the men, after drilling them for a few days, forty of the most intelligent
as what we call noncommissioned officers.

 Let the dishes be taken to him,
every morning, and removed every evening. Each evening they shall be weighed."

These orders were carried out, and on the following morning the dishes were placed in the cell
of the prisoner. When removed at night, they were found to be untouched. The next evening several
of the dishes were found to have lost some ounces in weight. The third evening all but one
had been tasted.

"Let the prisoner be brought in again," the rajah ordered, when informed of this.

"Dog," he said, "you have betrayed yourself. Had you been innocent, you could not have known
in which of the dishes the poison had been placed. You have eaten of all but one. If that one
contains poison, you are guilty."

Then, turning to an attendant, he ordered him to take a portion of the untouched food, and
to throw it to a dog. Pending the experiment, the prisoner was removed. Half an hour later,
the attendant returned with the news that the dog was dead.

"The guilt of the man is confirmed," the rajah said. "Let him be executed."

"Will you give him to me, your highness?" Charlie asked. "His death would not benefit me now,
and to save his life, he may tell me who is my enemy. It is of no use punishing the instrument,
and letting the instigator go free."

"You are right," the rajah agreed. "If you can find out who bribed him, justice shall be done,
though it were the highest in the state."

Charlie returned to his own quarters, assembled his lieutenants and several other of his officers,
and had the man brought before him.

"Hossein," he said, "you have taken money to take my life. I looked upon you as my faithful
servant. I had done you no wrong. It has been proved that you attempted to poison me. You,
when driven by hunger, ate small quantities, which you thought would pass unobserved, of all
the dishes but one. That dish has been given to a dog, and he has died. You knew, then, which
was the poisoned dish. The rajah has ordered your execution. I offer you life, if you will
tell me who it was that tempted you."

The prisoner preserved a stolid silence.

"We had better proceed to torture him, at once," one of the rajah's officers said.

The man turned a little paler. He knew well the horrible tortures which would, in such an instance,
be inflicted to extort the names of those who had bribed him.

"I will say nothing," he said, firmly, "though you tear me limb from limb."

"I have no intention of torturing you," Charlie said. "A confession extorted by pain is as
likely to be false as true, and even did you tell me one name, there might still be a dozen
engaged in it who would remain unknown. No, Hossein, you have failed in your duty, you have
tried to slay a master who was kind to you, and trusted you."

"No, sahib," the man exclaimed, passionately. "You did not trust me. The food I sent you was
tested and tried. I knew it; but I thought that the poison would not have acted on the monkeys,
until you had eaten the dish. The fool who sold it me deceived me. Had you trusted me, I would
never have done it. It was only when I saw that I was suspected and doubted, without cause,
that my heart turned against you, and I took the gold which was offered to me to kill you.
I swear it by the Prophet."

Charlie looked at him steadily.

"I believe you," he said. "You were mistaken. I had no suspicions. My servant feared for me,
and took these precautions without telling me. However, Hossein, I pardon you, and if you will
swear to me to be faithful, in future, I will trust you. You shall again be my cook, and I
will eat the food as you prepare it for me."

"I am my lord's slave," the man said in a low tone. "My life is his."

Charlie nodded, and the guard standing on either side of the prisoner stepped back, and without
another word he left the room, a free man.

Charlie's officers remonstrated with him upon having not only pardoned the man, but restored
him to his position of cook.

"I think I have done wisely," Charlie said. "I must have a cook, for Tim Kelly here is not
famous that way; and although he might manage for me, when alone, he certainly could not turn
out a dinner which would be suitable, when I have some of the rajah's kinsmen and officers
dining with me. Did I get another cook, he might be just as open to the offers of my enemies
as Hossein has been; and do you not think that, after what has passed, Hossein will be less
likely to take bribes than any other man?"

Henceforth the oven was removed from the antechamber, and Charlie took his meals as Hossein
prepared them for him. The man said little, but Charlie felt sure, from the glances that he
cast at him, that he could rely upon Hossein now to the death.

Tim Kelly, who felt the strongest doubts as to the prudence of the proceeding, observed that
Hossein no longer bought articles from men who brought them up to sell to the soldiers, but
that every morning he went out early, and purchased all the supplies he desired from the shopkeepers
in the town. Tim mentioned the fact to his master, who said:

"You see, Tim, Hossein has determined that I shall not be poisoned without his knowing it.
The little peddlers who come up here with herbs, and spices, and the ingredients for curry,
might be bribed to sell Hossein poisoned goods. By going down into the town, and buying in
the open market, it is barely possible that the goods could be poisoned. You need have no more
anxiety whatever, Tim, as to poison. If the attempt is made again, it will probably be by sword
or dagger."

"Well, yer honor," said Tim, "anything's better than pison. I've got to sleep almost with one
eye open. And you've got sentries outside your windows. What a pity it is that we ain't in
a climate where one can fasten the windows, and boult the shutters! But now the wet season
is over again, ye might have yer bed put, as ye did last year, on the roof of your room, with
a canopy over it to keep off the dew. Ye would be safe then, except from anyone coming through
the room where I sleeps."

 A store of provisions
and ammunition was collected there, and the command given to one of Charlie's Sepoy lieutenants,
with a hundred trained artillerymen, and two hundred infantry. Numbers of cattle had been driven
into the town and castle, and stores of provisions collected.

It was but two days after the battery was complete that the news arrived that the rajah's brother,
with Murari Reo, had entered the rajah's dominions, and was marching up the valley to the assault.
The rajah had, in the first place, wished to defend a strong gorge through which the enemy
would have to pass; this having hitherto been considered the defensible point of his capital,
against an invasion. Charlie pointed out, however, that although no doubt a successful defence
might be made here, it would only be a repulse, which would leave the enemy but little weakened
for further operations. He argued that it was better to allow them to advance to the point
where the valley opened out into a plain, some two miles wide. He had no doubt whatever that
the rajah's troops would be able to inflict a crushing defeat upon the invaders, who would
be so disheartened, thereby, that they would be little likely to renew the attack.

Two bodies of troops, each three hundred strong, were sent down to the gorge, with orders to
remain in hiding among the heights, to allow the invading army to pass unmolested, and then
to inflict the greatest possible loss upon them, as they returned. These were under the command
of another of Charlie's lieutenants, who received orders from him to erect breastworks of rock
on the slopes above the entrance to the gorge, after the enemy had passed on; and to line these
with a portion of his men, who should pour a heavy fire into the enemy as they came down the
valley; while the rest were to line the heights above the gorge, and to roll down rocks upon
those who passed through the fire of their comrades.

The uniforms were served out to the soldiers, and Charlie surveyed, with pride, the five battalions
of trained troops which, with twelve guns, marched down into the valley and took up their post
beyond it, at a point which he had carefully chosen, where the guns of the castle would be
able to play upon an advancing body of troops. A body of trained artillerymen were told off
for this service, and the last-raised levies were posted in the castle and on the walls of
the town.

The position was so chosen that the flanks of the line rested on the slopes on either side.
These were broken by inclosures and gardens; into which, on either side, half a battalion was
thrown forward, so as to deliver a flanking fire upon an enemy advancing against the centre.
Across the valley, two hundred yards in front of the position, the stream which watered it
made a sharp turn, running for some distance directly across it, and several small canals for
the irrigation of the fields rendered the ground wet and swampy. Across the line occupied by
his troops, a breastwork had been thrown up, and in front of this rows of sharp-pointed stakes
had been stuck in the ground. Altogether, the position was a formidable one.

An hour or two after the position so carefully prepared had been taken up, large bodies of
Mahratta horse were seen dashing up the valley, and smoke rising from several points showed
that they had begun their usual work, of plundering and destroying the villages on their way.
A few discharges from the field pieces--those in the castle had been ordered to be silent until
the raising of a white flag gave them the signal to open fire--checked the advance of the horsemen,
and these waited until their infantry should arrive.

The force of Murari Reo was, at that time, the most formidable of any purely native army of
Southern India. Recruited from desperadoes from all the Mahratta tribes, well disciplined by
its leader, it had more than once fought, without defeat, against bodies of Europeans; while
it had, in all cases, obtained easy victories over other native armies.

Presently the horsemen opened, and a compact body of three thousand Mahratta infantry, accompanied
by an equal number of the irregulars of the rajah's brother, advanced to the attack; while
the cavalry at their sides swept down upon the flanks of the rajah's position, and thirty pieces
of artillery opened fire.

Chapter 14: The Siege Of Ambur.

The victory was a complete and decisive one. A thousand of the best troops of Murari Reo had
fallen, besides some hundreds of their irregular allies, whose loss was incurred almost wholly
at the gorge in the retreat. The rajah was in the highest state of delight at the splendid
result, obtained by the European training of his troops; and these, proud of their victory
over such formidable opponents, were full of enthusiasm for their young English leader. The
rejoicings in Ambur that night were great, and all felt confident that the danger was at an end.

"What think you," the rajah said to Charlie, as, the long feast at an end, they sat together
in the divan, smoking their narghileys, "will be the result, when the news of the defeat of
Murari Reo reaches Hyderabad?"

"It is difficult to say," Charlie replied. "It is possible, of course, that it may be considered
that it is better to leave you in peace; but, upon the other hand, it may be that they will
consider that you are so formidable a power, that it is absolutely necessary to crush you at

affair from that which we have had today.

"Still, I should send off a messenger tomorrow, to acquaint the nizam with the defeat you inflicted
upon the Mahrattas who have invaded you, to assure him again of your loyalty, and to beg him
to lay his authority upon Murari Reo, not to renew the attack."

Ten days later a messenger arrived from the nizam, ordering the rajah to repair, at once, to
Hyderabad, to explain his conduct. The latter sent back a message of humble excuses, saying
that his health was so injured, by the excitement of recent events, that he was unable to travel;
but that, when he recovered, he would journey to Hyderabad to lay his respects at the feet
of the nizam.

Two or three days later a messenger arrived from Mr. Saunders, with a letter to Charlie. In
this he expressed his great satisfaction at the defeat Murari Reo had received; a defeat which
would, for some time, keep him quiet, and so relieve the strain upon the English. Affairs had,
he said, since the departure of Clive for England, been going badly. Dupleix had received large
reinforcements, and the English had suffered several reverses. Mr. Saunders begged him to assure
the rajah of the respect and friendship of England, and to give him the promise that, if he
should be driven from his capital, he would be received with all honor at Madras, and should
be reinstated in his dominions, with much added territory, when the English were again in a
position to take the field in force, and to settle their long feud with the French.

Ten days later, they heard that the army of the nizam, of fifteen thousand troops, with eight
hundred French under Bussy, were marching against them; and that the horsemen of Murari Reo
were devastating the villages near the frontier. Column had the conviction must think from lying

 He warned him, however, to be careful in the extreme how he made his way
back, as the country was in a most disturbed state, the Mahratta bands being everywhere out
plundering and burning.

Subsequent information, that the Mahrattas were swarming in the plains below, determined Charlie
to accept an offer which the rajah made him; that he should, under a strong escort, cross the
mountains, and make his way to a port on the west coast, in the state of a friendly rajah,
where he would be able to take ship and coast round to Madras. The rajah promised to send Charlie's
horses and other presents down to Madras, when an opportunity should offer; and Charlie, accompanied
by the four Sepoys, all of whom had been promoted to the rank of officers; by Tim Kelly and
Hossein, who would not separate himself a moment from his side, started from Ambur, with an
escort of thirty horsemen.

The rajah was quite affected at the parting; and the army, which he had formed and organized,
paraded before him for the last time, and then shouted their farewell.

Charlie himself, although glad to return among his countrymen, from whom he had been nearly
two years separated, was yet sorry to leave the many friends he had made. His position was
now a very different one from that which he held when he left Madras. Then he was a newly made
lieutenant, who had distinguished himself, indeed, under Clive, but who was as yet unknown
save to his commander, and who was as poor as when he had landed, eighteen months before, in
India. Now he had gained a name for himself, and his successful defence of Ambur had been of
immense service to the Company. He was, too, a wealthy man; for the presents in money, alone,
of the rajah, had amounted to over twenty-five thousand pounds; a sum which, in these days,
may appear extraordinary, but which was small to that frequently bestowed, by wealthy native
princes, upon British officers who had done them a good service. Clive himself, after his short
campaign, had returned to England with a far larger sum.

For several days, the party rode through the hills without incident; and on the fifth day they
saw, stretched at their feet, a rich flat country dotted with villages, beyond which extended
the long blue line of the sea. The distance was greater than Charlie imagined, and 'twas only
after two days' long ride that he reached Calicut, where he was received with great honor by
the rajah, to whom the leader of the escort brought letters of introduction from the Rajah
of Ambur.

For four days Charlie remained as his guest, and then took a passage in a large native vessel,
bound for Ceylon, whence he would have no difficulty in obtaining passage to Madras.

These native ships are very high out of water, rising considerably towards the stem and stern,
and in form they somewhat resemble the Chinese junk; but are without the superabundance of
grotesque painting, carving, and gilding which distinguish the latter. The rajah accompanied
Charlie to the shore, and a salute was fired, by his followers, in honor of the departure of
the guest.

The weather was lovely, and the clumsy craft, with all sail set, was soon running down the
coast. When they had sailed some hours from Calicut, from behind a headland, four vessels suddenly
made their appearance. They were lower in the water, and much less clumsy in appearance than
the ordinary native craft, and were propelled not only by their sails, but by a number of oars
on each side.

No sooner did the captain and crew of the ship behold these vessels, than they raised a cry
of terror and despair. The captain, who was part owner of the craft, ran up and down the deck
like one possessed, and the sailors seemed scarcely less terrified.

"What on earth is the matter?" Charlie exclaimed. "What vessels are those, and why are you
afraid of them?"

"Tulagi Angria! Tulagi Angria!" the captain cried, and the crew took up the refrain.

The name that they uttered fully accounted for their terror.

Chapter 15: The Pirates' Hold.

Sivagi, the founder of the Mahratta Empire, had, in 1662, seized and fortified Yijiyadrug;
or, as the English call it, Gheriah, a town at the mouth of the river Kanui, one hundred and
seventy miles south of Bombay; and also the island of Suwarndrug, about half way between Gheriah
and Bombay. Here he established a piratical fleet. Fifty years later, Kanhagi Angria, the commander
of the Mahratta fleet, broke off this connection with the successors of Sivagi, and set up
as a pirate on his own account. After medicine that employed to Forego, forty.

The skewers, for this is what they resembled, were very strong and tough; being made of slips
of bamboo. The prisoners had all knives, which they used for cutting their food. With these
the work was accomplished.

Towards morning the five natives, with the skewers hidden away in their loincloths, and their
turbans twisted in Mahratta fashion, stole out from the casemate. Charlie had ordered that,
in case they should see that the ships had drawn off from the position they occupied on the
preceding day, they should return without attempting to carry out their task.

He himself, with Tim, joined the sailors; and, first ascending the ramparts and seeing that
the ships were still at anchor, abreast of the fort, he and his comrades strolled across the
interior of the fort, in the direction of the magazine. They did not keep together, nor did
all move directly towards the position which they wished to gain.

The place was already astir. Large numbers of the pirates thronged the interior. Groups were
squatted round fires, busy in cooking their breakfasts. Numbers were coming from the magazine,
with powder to fill up the small magazines on the walls. Others, again, were carrying shot
from the pyramids of missiles, piled up here and there in the courtyard. None paid any attention
to the English prisoners.

Presently a dull boom was heard. There was a whistling sound; and with a thud, followed by
a loud explosion, a bomb fell and burst in the open space.

This was the signal for action. The pirates, in a moment, hurried down to the bastions overlooking
the sea; and the Englishmen gathered, in a group, near the entrance to the magazine. Besides
their knives they had no arms, but each had picked up two or three heavy stones.

A minute after the explosion of the shell, the cannonade of the ships broke out. It was answered
by only a few guns from the fortress, and yells of astonishment and rage were heard to arise.

A moment later, five natives ran up to the group of Englishmen. Their work had been well done,
and more than three-fourths of the guns on the sea face had been rendered temporarily useless.

Charlie gave the word, and with a rush they entered the upper fort. There were but two or three
men there, who were just hurrying out with their bags of powder. These, before they realized
the position, were instantly knocked down and bound. The gate of the fort was then shut and
barred, and the party ran up to the bastion above.

Not a single pirate was to be seen there. The six guns, which stood there, were at once loaded
with grape; and a heavy discharge was poured into the crowded masses of pirates, upon the bastions
on the sea face. These, already greatly disturbed at finding that most of their guns had, in
some way, been rendered useless; were panic stricken at this sudden and unexpected attack from
the rear. Many of them broke from their guns and fled to shelter, others endeavoured to turn
their cannon to bear upon the magazine.

The wildest confusion raged. At last some of their leaders rallied the men; and, with yells
of fury, a rush was made towards the magazine. They were received with another discharge of
grape, which took terrible effect. Many recoiled, but their leaders, shouting to them that
the guns were discharged, and there were but a dozen men there, led them on again.

Charlie leaped upon the edge of the parapet, and shouted:

"If you attack us, we will blow up the magazine. I have but to lift my hand, and the magazine
will be fired."

The boldest of the assailants were paralysed by the threat. Confusion reigned throughout the
fortress. The fleet kept up their fire with great vigour; judging, by the feebleness of the
reply, that something unusual must be happening within the walls. The gunners, disheartened
by finding their pieces useless, and unable to extract the wooden plugs, while Charlie's men
continued to ply them with grape, left their guns and, with the greater portion of the garrison,
disorganized and panic stricken, retired into shelter.

A shell from the ships, falling on to a thatched building, set it on fire. The flames rapidly
spread, and soon all the small huts occupied by the garrison were in flames. The explosion
of a magazine added to the terror of the garrison, and the greater portion of them, with the
women and children, ran down to the water; and, taking boats, attempted to cross to Fort Goa,
on the mainland. They were, however, cut off by the English boats, and captured.

Commodore James, who commanded the squadron, now directed his fire at Fort Goa; which was being
feebly attacked, on the land side, by a Mahratta force; which had been landed from the Mahratta
fleet, accompanying the English ships, a few miles down the coast. The fort shortly surrendered;
but while the Mahrattas were marching to take possession, the governor, with some of his best
men, took boat and crossed over to the island; of which, although the fire had ceased after
the explosion of the magazine, the English had not taken possession.

The fire from its guns again opened, and as Commodore James thought it probable that the pirates
would, in the night, endeavour to throw in large reinforcements, he determined to carry it
by storm. The ships opened fire upon the walls; and, under cover of this, half the seamen were
landed. These ran up to the gate, and thundered at it with their axes.

Charlie and his companions aided the movement, by again opening a heavy fire of grape upon
the guns which bore upon the sally port; and when the gates were forced the garrison, utterly
dispirited by the crossfire to which they were subjected, at once laid down their arms.

Chapter 16: A Tiger Hunt.

Commodore James was greatly astonished at the easy success which he had gained. The extraordinary
cessation of fire from the sea face, and the sound of artillery within the walls, had convinced
him that a mutiny among the garrison must have taken place; but upon entering the fort he was
surprised, indeed, at being received with a hearty English cheer, from a little body of men
on the summit of an interior work. The gate of this was at once thrown open, and Charlie, followed
by his party, advanced towards the commodore.

"I am Captain Marryat, sir, of the Company's service in Madras; and was captured three months
ago by these pirates. When you attacked the place, yesterday, I arranged to effect a small
diversion; and with the assistance of these five native officers, of my soldier servant, here,
and these ten men of the merchant service, we have, I hope, been able to do so. Answer arise due.

 The
patch of jungle stood upon a steep terrace, whose slopes were formed of boulders, the patch
being some fifty or sixty yards long and thirty deep.

"It is a nasty place," Ramajee Punt said, "to get him from. The beaters cannot get behind to
drive him out, and the jungle is too thick to penetrate."

"How do you intend to proceed?" Charlie asked.

"We will send a party to the top of the hill, and they will throw down crackers. We have brought
some rockets, too, which we will send in from the other side. We will take our places, on our
elephants, at the foot of the terrace."

The three elephants took their posts, at the foot of the boulder covered rise. As soon as they
had done so, the men at the top of the rock began to throw down numbers of lighted crackers;
while, from either side, parties sent rockets whizzing into the jungle.

For some time the tiger showed no signs of his presence, and Charlie began to doubt whether
he could be really there. The shikaris, however, declared that he was certainly in the jungle.
He had, on the day before, carried off a woman from a neighbouring village; and had been traced
to the jungle, round which a watch had been kept all night.

Suddenly, uttering a mighty roar, the tiger bounded from the jungle, and stood at the edge
of the terrace. Startled at his sudden appearance, the elephants recoiled, shaking the aim
of their riders. Three shots were, however, fired almost at the same moment; and the tiger,
with another roar, bounded back into the jungle.

"I think," the rajah said, "that he is badly hit. Listen to his roarings."

The tiger, for a time, roared loudly at intervals. Then the sounds became lower and less frequent,
and at last ceased altogether. In vain did the natives above shower down crackers. In vain
were the rockets discharged into the jungle. An hour passed, since he had last been heard.

"I expect that he's dead," Charlie said.

"I think so, too," Ramajee Punt replied; "but one can never be certain. Let us draw off a little,
and take our luncheon. After that, we can try the fireworks again. If he will not move, then
we must leave him."

"But surely," Charlie said, "we might go in and see whether he's dead or not."

"A wounded tiger is a terrible foe," the Ramajee answered. "Better leave him alone."

Charlie, however, was anxious to get the skin to send home, with those of the others he had
shot, to his mother and sisters. It might be very long before he had an opportunity of joining
in another tiger hunt; and he resolved that, if the tiger gave no signs of life when the bombardment
of the jungle with fireworks recommenced, he would go in and look for his body.

Chapter 17: The Capture Of Gheriah.

After having sat for an hour under the shade of some trees, and partaken of luncheon, the party
again moved forward on their elephants to the jungle. The watchers declared that no sound,
whatever, had been heard during their absence; nor did the discharge of fireworks, which at
once recommenced, elicit the slightest response.

After this had gone on for half an hour, Charlie, convinced that the animal was dead, dismounted
from his elephant. He had with him a heavy, double-barrelled rifle of the rajah's; and Hossein,
carrying a similar weapon, and a curved tulwar which was sharpened almost to a razor edge,
prepared to follow immediately behind him. Three or four of the most courageous shikaris, with
cocked guns, followed in Hossein's steps.

Holding his gun advanced before him, in readiness to fire instantly, Charlie entered the jungle
at the point where the tiger had retreated into it. Drops of blood spotted the grass, and the
bent and twisted brushwood showed the path that the tiger had taken. Charlie moved as noiselessly
as possible. The path led straight forward, towards the rocks behind, but it was not until
within four or five yards of this that any sign of the tiger could be seen.

Then the bushes were burst asunder, and the great yellow body hurled itself forward upon Charlie.
The attack was so sudden and instantaneous that the latter had not even time to raise his rifle
to his shoulder. Almost instinctively, however, he discharged both of the barrels; but was,
at the same moment, hurled to the ground, where he lay crushed down by the weight of the tiger,
whose hot breath he could feel on his face. He closed his eyes, only to open them again at
the sound of a heavy blow, while a deluge of hot blood flowed over him. He heard Hossein's
voice, and then became insensible. When he recovered, he found himself lying with his head
supported by Hossein, outside the jungle.

"Is he dead?" he asked faintly.

"He is dead, Sahib," Hossein replied. "Let the Sahib drink some brandy, and he will be strong
again."

Charlie drank some brandy and water, which Hossein held to his lips. Then the latter raised
him to his feet.

Charlie felt his limbs and his ribs. He was bruised all over, but otherwise unhurt, the blood
which covered him having flowed from the tiger. Lazy so did the bathe "yellow Tomcat," able fringed,

 A gun from the admiral's ship gave the signal,
and a hundred and fifty pieces of cannon at once opened fire, while the mortar vessels threw
shell into the fort and town. In ten minutes after the fire began, a shell fell into one of
Angria's large ships, and set her on fire. The flames soon spread to the others, fastened together
on either side of her, and in less than an hour this fleet, which had for fifty years been
the terror of the Malabar coast, was utterly destroyed.

In the meantime the fleet kept up their fire, with the greatest vigour, upon the enemy's works;
and, before nightfall, the enemy's fire was completely silenced. No white flag, however, was
hung up, and the admiral had little doubt that it was intended to surrender the place to the
Mahrattas.

As soon, therefore, as it became quite dark, Colonel Clive landed with the troops, and took
up a position between the Mahrattas and the fort; where, to his great disappointment and disgust,
Ramajee Punt found him in the morning. The admiral again summoned the fort, declaring that
he would renew the attack, and give no quarter, unless it was surrendered immediately. The
governor sent back to beg the admiral to cease from hostilities until next day, as he was only
waiting for orders from Angria to surrender. Angria declared that he had already sent the orders.

At four in the afternoon, therefore, the bombardment was renewed; and in less than half an
hour, a white flag appeared above the wall. As, however, the garrison made no further sign
of surrender, and refused to admit Colonel Clive with his troops, when he advanced to take
possession, the bombardment was again renewed, more vigorously than ever. The enemy were unable
to support the violence of the fire, and soon shouted over the walls, to Clive, that they surrendered;
and he might enter and take possession. The troops took that its captives had entirely various and
its soldiers of convalescence, and that they led to cities could

 The civilians as well as the soldiers had done
their duty nobly, but the loss had been heavy, from the fire of the enemy's sharpshooters in
the surrounding buildings; and it was evident that, however gallant the defence, the fort could
not much longer resist.

All day long, signals had been kept flying for the fleet, two miles below, to come up to the
fort; but although these could be plainly seen, not a ship weighed anchor.

Chapter 18: The "Black Hole" Of Calcutta.

When the fire of the enemy slackened, Charlie went to Mr. Holwell.

"It is impossible, sir," he said, "that the fort can hold out; for in another three or four
days, the whole of the garrison will be killed. The only hope of safety is for the ships to
come up, and remove the garrison, which they can do without the slightest danger to themselves.
If you will allow me, sir, I will swim down to the ships, and represent our situation. Cowardly
and inhuman as Mr. Drake has proved himself, he can hardly refuse to give orders for the fleet
to move."

"I don't know," said Mr. Holwell. "After the way in which he has behaved, there are no depths
of infamy of which I believe him incapable. But you are my right hand here. Supposing Mr. Drake
refuses, you could not return."

"I will come back, sir," Charlie answered. "I will, if there be no other way, make my way along
by the river bank. It is comparatively free of the enemy, as our guns command it. If you will
place Mr. Haines at the corner bastion, with a rope, he will recognize my voice, and I can
regain the fort."

Mr. Holwell consented, and as soon as it was perfectly dark, Charlie issued out at the watergate,
took off his coat, waistcoat, and boots, and entered the stream. The current was slack, but
he had no difficulty in keeping himself afloat until he saw, close ahead of him, the lights
of the ships.

He hailed that nearest him. A rope was thrown, and he was soon on board. Upon stating who he
was, a boat was at once lowered, and he was taken to the ship upon which Mr. Drake and Captain
Minchin had taken refuge. Upon saying that he was the bearer of a message from the gentleman
now commanding the fort, he was conducted to the cabin, where Mr. Drake and Captain Minchin,
having finished their dinner, were sitting comfortably over their wine with Captain Young,
the senior captain of the Company's ships there.

"I have come, sir," Charlie said to Mr. Drake, "from Mr. Holwell; who has, in your absence,
been elected to the command of the fort. He bids me tell you that our losses have been already
very heavy, and that it is impossible that the fort can hold out for more than twenty-four
hours longer. He begs you, therefore, to order up the ships tonight, in order that the garrison
may embark."

"It is quite out of the question," Mr. Drake said coldly. "Quite. It would be extremely dangerous.

"You agree with me, Captain Young, that it would be most dangerous?"

"I consider that it would be dangerous," Captain Young said.

"And you call yourself," Charlie exclaimed indignantly, "a British sailor! You talk of danger,
and would desert a thousand men, women, and children, including two hundred of your own countrymen,
and leave them at the mercy of an enemy!"

"You forget whom you are speaking to, sir," Mr. Drake said, angrily.

"I forgot nothing, sir," Charlie replied, trying to speak calmly. "Then, sir, Mr. Holwell has
charged me that if--which, however, he could not believe for a moment to be possible--you refuse
to move up the ships to receive the garrison on board, that you would at least order all the
boats up, as these would be amply sufficient to carry them away. Even in the daytime there
would be no danger for the ships; and at night, at least, boats might come up, without being
exposed to any risk whatever."

"I shall certainly do nothing of the sort," Mr. Drake said. "The danger is even greater for
the boats than for the ships."

"And am I, sir, to return to the garrison of that fort, with the news that you utterly desert
them, that you intend to remain quietly here, while they are sacrificed before your eyes? Is
it possible that you are capable of such infamy as this?"

"Infamy!" exclaimed the three men, rising to their feet.

"I place you in arrest at once, for your insolence," Mr. Drake said.

"I despise your arrest, as I do yourself.

"I did not believe it possible," Charlie said, at last giving vent to his anger and scorn;
"and England will not believe, that three Englishmen so cowardly, so infamous as yourselves,
are to be found.

"As for you, Captain Minchin, if ever after this I come across you, I will flog you publicly
first, and shoot you afterwards like a dog, if you dare to meet me.

"As for you, Mr. Drake--as for you, Captain Young--you will be doomed to infamy, by the contempt
and loathing which Englishmen will feel, when this deed is known.

"Cowards; base, infamous cowards!"

Charlie stepped back to go.

"Seize him!" Mr. Drake said, himself rushing forward.

Charlie drew back a step; and then, with all his strength, smote the governor between the eyes,
and he fell in a heap beneath the table. Then Charlie grasped a decanter.

"Now," he said, "if either of you hounds move a finger, I'll brain you."

The two officers stood paralysed. Charlie walked to the door, and sprang up the cabin stairs;
and, as he did so, heard shouts for assistance from behind. He gained the deck, walked quietly
to the bulwark and, placing his hand upon it, sprang over the side into the river. He swam
to shore and, climbing up the bank, made his way along it back to the fort, where he arrived
without any misadventure.

A fury of indignation seized all in the fort, when the result of Charlie's mission became known.
With daybreak the attack recommenced; but the garrison, all day, bravely repulsed every attempt
of the enemy to gain a footing. The fire from the houses was, however, so severe, that by nightfall
nearly half the garrison were killed or wounded.

All day the signals to the fleet were kept flying, but not a ship moved. All night, an anxious
watch was kept, in hopes that, at the last moment, some returning feeling of shame might induce
the recreants to send up the boats of the ships. But the night passed without a movement on
the river, and in the morning the fleet were seen, still lying at anchor.

The enemy recommenced the attack, even more vigorously than before. The men fell fast and,
to Charlie's great grief, his friend Mr. Haines was shot by a bullet, as he was standing next
to him. Charlie anxiously knelt beside him.

"It is all over with me," he murmured. "Poor little Ada. Do all you can for her, Marryat. God
knows what fate is in store for her."

"I will protect her with my life, sir," Charlie said earnestly.

Mr. Haines pressed his hand feebly, in token of gratitude; and, two or three minutes later,
breathed his last.

By midday, the loss had been so heavy that the men would no longer stand to their guns. Many
of the European soldiers broke open the spirit stores, and soon drank to intoxication.

After a consultation with his officers, Mr. Holwell agreed that further resistance was hopeless.
The flag of truce was therefore hoisted, and one of the officers at once started for the nabob's
camp, with instructions to make the best terms he could for the garrison. When the gates were
opened the enemy, seizing the opportunity, rushed in in great numbers; and as resistance was
impossible, the garrison laid down their arms.

Charlie at once hurried to the spot where Ada, and the only other European lady who had not
escaped, were anxiously awaiting news. Both were exhausted with weeping.

"Where is papa, Captain Marryat?" Ada asked.

Charlie knew that the poor girl would need all her strength, for what she might have to undergo;
and at once resolved that, for the present at least, it would be better that she should be
in ignorance of the fate of her father. He therefore said that, for the present, Mr. Haines
was unable to come, and had asked him to look after her.

It was not until five o'clock that the nabob entered the fort. He was furious at hearing that
only five lacs of rupees had been found in the treasury, as he had expected to become possessed
of a vastly larger sum. Kissendas, the first cause of the present calamities, was brought before
him; but the capricious tyrant, contrary to expectation, received him courteously, and told
him he might return to Dacca. The whole of the Eurasians, or half castes, and natives found
in the fort were also allowed to return to their homes.

Mr. Holwell was then sent for, and after the nabob had expressed his resentment at the small
amount found in the treasury, he was dismissed, the nabob assuring him of his protection. Mr.
Holwell returned to his English companions, who, one hundred and forty-six in number, including
the two ladies, were drawn up under the veranda in front of the prison. The nabob then returned
to his camp.

Some native officers went in search of some building where the prisoners could be confined,
but every room in the fort had already been taken possession of, by the nabob's soldiers and
officers. At eight o'clock, they returned with the news that they could find no place vacant,
and the officer in command at once ordered the prisoners into a small room, used as a guardroom
for insubordinate soldiers, eighteen feet square.

In vain they protested that it was impossible the room could contain them, in vain implored
the officer to allow some of them to be confined in an adjoining cell. The wretch was deaf
to their entreaties. He ordered his soldiers to charge the prisoners, and these, with blows
of the butt ends of the muskets, and prods of the bayonets, were driven into the narrow cell.

Round the centre of the arrow a piece of greased silk was wrapped. Charlie took this off, and
found beneath it a piece of paper, on which was written in Hindostanee:

"If you have a bar loosed, pull the string and haul up a rope. If not, throw the arrow down.
I will come again, tomorrow night."

Tim had by this time joined Charlie, and they speedily began to pull in the string. Presently
a thicker string came up into their hands. They continued to pull, and soon the end of a stout
rope, in which knots were tied every two feet, came up to them. They fastened this to one of
the bars, and then took hold of that which they had loosened; and, putting their feet against
the wall, exerted themselves to the utmost. The iron was tougher than they had expected, but
they were striving for liberty and, with desperate exertions, they bent it inwards until, at
last, there was room enough for them to creep through.

"Can you swim, Tim?"

"Not a stroke, yer honor. Shure you should know that, when you fished me out of the water."

"Very well, Tim. As I kept you up then, 'twill be easy enough for me, now, to take you across
the moat. I will go first, and when I get into the water, will keep hold of the rope till you
come down. Take off your boots, for they would be heard scraping against the wall. Be sure
you make as little noise as possible, and lower yourself quietly into the water."

Charlie then removed his own boots, squeezed himself through the bars and, grasping the rope
tightly, began to descend. He found the knots of immense assistance, for had it not been for
them, unaccustomed as he was to the work, he would have been unable to prevent himself from
sliding down too rapidly. The window was fully sixty feet above the moat, and he was very thankful
when, at last, he felt the water touch his feet. Lowering himself quietly into it, he shook
the rope, to let Tim know that he could begin his descent.

Before Tim was halfway down, Charlie could hear his hard breathing, and muttered ejaculations
to himself:

"Shure I'll never get to the bottom at all, my arms are fairly breaking. I shall squash Mr.
Charles, if I fall on him."

"Hold your tongue, Tim," Charlie said in a loud whisper.

Tim was silent, but the panting and puffing increased, and Charlie swam a stroke or two away,
expecting every moment that Tim would fall. The Irishman, however, held on; but let himself
into the water with a splash, which aroused the attention of the sentry above, who instantly
challenged.

Tim and Charlie remained perfectly quiet. Again the sentry challenged. Then there was a long
silence. The sentry probably was unwilling to rouse the place by a false alarm, and the splash
might have been caused by the fall of a piece of decayed stone from the face of the wall.

"Tim, you clumsy fellow," whispered Charlie, "you nearly spoiled all."

"Shure, yer honor, I was kilt entirely, and my arms were pulled out of my sockets. Holy Mother,
who'd have thought 'twould be so difficult to come down a rope! The sailors are great men,
entirely."

"Now, Tim, lie quiet. I will turn you on your back, and swim across with you."

The moat was some twenty yards wide. Charlie swam across, towing Tim after him, and taking
the greatest pains to avoid making the slightest splash. The opposite side was of stonework,
and rose six feet above the water. As soon as they touched the wall, a stout rope was lowered
to them.

"Now, Tim, you climb up first."

"Is it climb up, yer honor? I couldn't do it, if it was to save my sowl. Of yield yet did the efficaciousness
is that the rope which shall try, but supporter was brought by watershed
and was become to firing.

Half an hour later, the lattice above opened. They heard a murmur of voices, and then all was
quiet again. After a few minutes, Charlie climbed noiselessly up the ladder and, just as he
reached the top, an arm was stretched out above him; and, a moment afterwards, Ada's face appeared.

"I am here, dear," he said, in a whisper. "Lean out, and I will take you."

The girl stretched out over the window. Charlie took her in his arms, and lifted her lightly
out, and then slowly descended the ladder. No sooner did he touch the ground than they hurried
away; Ada sobbing, with excitement and pleasure, on Charlie's shoulder; Tim and Hossein bearing
the ladder; Hossein having already carried out his promise of concealing the second bracelet
under the window.

In a few minutes they had safely surmounted the wall, and hurried across the country, with
all speed. Before leaving the town, Hossein had purchased a cart with two bullocks; and had
hired a man who was recommended to him, by one of his co-religionists there, as one upon whose
fidelity he could rely. This cart was awaiting them at a grove.

Paying them the amount stipulated, Hossein took the ox goad and started the bullocks, Tim walking
beside him, while Charlie and Ada took their places in the cart. They were sure that a hot
pursuit would be set up. The rage of the nabob at the escape of Charlie and his servant had
been extreme, and the whole country had been scoured by parties of horsemen; and they were
sure that the rajah would use every possible means to discover Ada, before he ventured to report
to the nabob that the prisoner committed to his charge had escaped.

"Of course, I can't see you very well," Ada said, "but I should not have known you, in the least."

"No, I am got up like a peasant," Charlie answered. "We shall have to dress you so, before
morning. We have got things here for you."

"Oh, how delighted I was," Ada exclaimed, "when I got your note! I found it so difficult to
keep on looking sad and hopeless, when I could have sung for joy. I had been so miserable.
There seemed no hope, and they said, some day, I should be sent to the nabob's zenana--wretches!
How poor mamma will be grieving for me, and papa!--

"Ah! Captain Marryat, he is dead, is he not?"

"Yes, my dear," Charlie said gently. "He was killed by my side, that afternoon. With his last
breath, he asked me to take care of you."

"I thought so," Ada said, crying quietly. "I did not think of it at the time. Everything was
so strange, and so dreadful, that I scarcely thought at all. But afterwards, on the way here,
when I turned it all over, it seemed to me that it must be so. He did not come to me, all that
afternoon. He was not shut up with us in that dreadful place, and everyone else was there.
So it seemed to me that he must have been killed, but that you did not like to tell me."

"It was better for him, dear, than to have died in that terrible cell. Thank God your mamma
is safe, and some day you will join her again.

"We have news that the English are coming up to attack Calcutta. A party are already in the
Hoogly; and the nabob is going to start, in a few days, to his army there. I hope, in a very
very short time, you will be safe among your friends."

After travelling for several hours, they stopped. Charlie gave Ada some native clothes and
ornaments, and told her to stain her face, arms, and legs, to put on the bangles and bracelets,
and then to rejoin them. Half an hour later, Ada took her seat in the cart, this time transformed
into a Hindoo girl, and the party again proceeded.

They felt sure that Ada's flight would not be discovered until daybreak. It would be some little
time before horsemen could be sent off in all directions, in pursuit; and they could not be
overtaken until between eleven and twelve.

The waggon was filled with grain, on the top of which Charlie and Ada were seated. When daylight
came, Charlie alighted and walked by the cart. Unquestioned, they passed through several villages.

At eleven o'clock, Hossein pointed to a large grove, at some little distance from the road.

"Go in there," he said, "and stay till nightfall. Do you then come out, and follow me. I shall
go into the next village, and remain there till after dark. I shall then start, and wait for
you half a mile beyond the village."

An hour after the waggon had disappeared from sight, the party in the grove saw ten or twelve
horsemen galloping rapidly along the road. An hour passed, and the same party returned, at
an equal speed. They saw no more of them and, after it became dark, they continued their way;
passed through the village, which was three miles ahead; and found Hossein waiting, a short
distance beyond. Ada climbed into the cart, and they again went forward.

"Did you put the rajah's men on the wrong track, Hossein? We guessed that you had done so,
when we saw them going back."

"Yes," Hossein said. "I had unyoked the bullocks, and had lain down in the caravanserai, when
they arrived. They came in, and their leader asked who I was. I said that I was taking down
a load of grain, for the use of the army at Calcutta. He asked where were the two men and the
woman who were with me. I replied that I knew nothing of them. I had overtaken them on the
road, and they had asked leave for the woman to ride in the cart. They said they were going
to visit their mother, who was sick.

"He asked if I was sure they were natives, and I counterfeited surprise, and said that certainly
they were; for which lie Allah will, I trust, be merciful, since it was told to an enemy. I
said that they had left me, just when we had passed the last village; and had turned off by
the road to the right, saying they had many miles to go.

"They talked together and decided that, as you were the only people who had been seen along
the road, they must follow and find you; and so started at once, and I daresay they're searching
for you now, miles away."

Their journey continued without any adventure, until within a few miles of Calcutta. Hossein
then advised them to take up their abode in a ruined mud hut, at a distance from the road.
He had bought, at the last village, a supply of provisions, sufficient to last them for some days.

"I shall now," he said, "go into the town, sell my grain, bullocks, and cart, and find out
where the soldiers are."

As soon as the news of the nabob's advance against Calcutta reached Madras, Mr. Pigot, who
was now governor there, despatched a force of two hundred and thirty men, under the orders
of Major Kilpatrick. The party reached Falta, on the Hoogly, on the 2nd of August, and there
heard of the capture of Calcutta. By detachments, who came down from some of the Company's
minor posts, the force was increased to nearly four hundred. But sickness broke out among them
and, finding himself unable to advance against so powerful an army as that of the nabob, Major
Kilpatrick sent to Madras for further assistance.

When the news reached that place, Clive had recently arrived with a strong force, which was
destined to operate against the French at Hyderabad. The news, however, of the catastrophe
at Calcutta at once altered the destination of the force; and, on the 16th of October, the
expedition sailed for Calcutta. The force consisted of two hundred and fifty men of the 39th
Foot, the first regiment of the regular English army which had been sent out to India; five
hundred and seventy men of the Madras European force; eighty artillerymen; and twelve hundred
Sepoys.

Of the nine hundred Europeans, only six hundred arrived at that time at the mouth of the Hoogly,
the largest ship, the Cumberland, with three hundred men on board, having grounded on the way.
The remainder of the fleet, consisting of three ships of war, five transports, and a fire ship,
reached Falta between the 11th and 20th of December.

Hossein had returned from Calcutta, with the news that the party commanded by Major Kilpatrick
had been, for some weeks, at Falta; and the party at once set off towards that place, which
was but forty miles distant. Engineering was belaboured to they, noise, broiler, it was. Like my double-cursed,

 Clive knew, however, that the Mahratta Ditch was on his right and, moving
a portion of his troops till they touched this, he again advanced, his object being to gain
a causeway which, raised several feet above the country, led from Calcutta, across the Mahratta
Ditch, into the country beyond. Towards this Clive now advanced, his troops firing, as they
marched, into the fog ahead of them, and the guns firing from the flanks, obliquely, to the
right and left.

Without experiencing any opposition Clive reached the causeway, and the Sepoys, turning to
their right, advanced along this towards the ditch. As they crossed this, however, they came
in the line of fire of their own guns, the officer commanding them being ignorant of what was
taking place in front, and unable to see a foot before him. Charlie, closely accompanied always
by Tim, was at the head of his troops when the iron hail of the English guns struck the head
of the column, mowing down numbers of men. A panic ensued, and the Sepoys, terror stricken
at this discharge, from a direction in which they considered themselves secure, leaped from
the causeway into the dry ditch and sheltered themselves there. Charlie and his companion were
saved by the fact that they were a few paces ahead of the column.

"Run back, Tim," Charlie said. "Find Colonel Clive, and tell him that we are being mowed down
by our own artillery. If you can't find him, hurry back to the guns, and tell the officer what
he is doing."

Charlie then leaped down into the ditch, and endeavoured to rally the Sepoys. A few minutes
later Clive himself arrived, and the Sepoys were induced to leave the ditch, and to form again
by the side of the causeway, along which the British troops were now marching.

Suddenly, however, from the fog burst out the discharge of two heavy guns, which the enemy
had mounted on a bastion flanking the ditch. The shouts of the officers, and the firing of
the men, indicated precisely the position of the column. The grapeshot tore through it, and
twenty-two of the English troops fell dead and wounded. Immediately afterwards another discharge
followed, and the column, broken and confused, bewildered by the dense fog, and dismayed by
the fire of these unseen guns, fell back.

Clive now determined to push on to the main road, which he knew crossed the fields half a mile
in front of him. The country was, however, here laid out in rice fields, each inclosed by banks
and ditches. Over these banks it was impossible to drag the guns, and the sailors could only
get them along by descending into the ditches, and using these as roads. The labour was prodigious,
and the men, fatigued and harassed by this battle in darkness, and by the fire from the unseen
guns which the enemy continued to pour in their direction from either flank, began to lose heart.

Happily, however, the fog began to lift. The flanks of the columns were covered by bodies of
troops, thrown out on either side, and after more than an hour's hard work, and abandoning
two of the guns which had broken down, Clive reached the main road, again formed his men in
column, and advanced towards the city.

The odds were overwhelmingly against him. There were guns, infantry, and cavalry, both in front
and behind them. The column pressed on, in spite of the heavy fire, crossed the ditch, and
attacked a strong body of the enemy drawn up on the opposite side. While it did so, a great
force of the nabob's cavalry swept down on the rear, and for a moment captured the guns. Ensign
Yorke, of the 39th Foot, faced the rear company about, and made a gallant charge upon the horsemen,
drove them back, and recaptured the guns.

Clive's whole army was now across the ditch, and it was open to him either to carry out his
original plan of attacking Omichund's garden, or of marching forward into the fort of Calcutta.
Seeing that his men were fatigued, and worn out with six hours of labour and marching under
the most difficult circumstances, he took the latter alternative, entered Calcutta, and then,
following the stream, marched back to the camp he had left in the morning.

His loss amounted to thirty-nine Europeans killed, and eighteen Sepoys; eighty-two Europeans
wounded, and thirty-five Sepoys; the casualties being caused almost entirely by the enemy's cannon.

The expedition, from a military point of view, had been an entire failure. He had carried neither
the battery nor Omichund's garden. Had it not been for the fog he might have succeeded in both
these objects; but, upon the other hand, the enemy were as much disconcerted by the fog as
he was, and were unable to use their forces with any effect. Military critics have decided
that the whole operation was a mistake; but although a mistake and a failure, its consequences
were no less decisive.

The nabob, struck with astonishment at the daring and dash of the English, in venturing with
so small a force to attack him, and to march through the very heart of his camp, was seized
with terror. He had lost thirteen hundred men in the fight, among whom were twenty-four rajahs
and lesser chiefs, and the next morning he sent in a proposal for peace.

A less determined man than Clive would, no doubt, have accepted the proposal. Calcutta was
still besieged by a vastly superior force, supplies of all kinds were running short, the attack
of the previous day had been a failure. He knew, however, the character of Asiatics, and determined
to play the game of bounce. The very offer of the nabob showed him that the latter was alarmed.
He therefore wrote to him, saying that he had simply marched his troops through his highness'
camp to show him of what British soldiers were capable; but that he had been careful to avoid
hurting anyone, except those who actually opposed his progress. He concluded by expressing
his willingness to accede to the nabob's proposal, and to negotiate.

The nabob took it all in. If all this destruction and confusion had been wrought by a simple
march through his camp, what would be the result if Clive were to take into his head to attack
him in earnest? He therefore at once withdrew his army three miles to the rear, and opened
negotiations. He granted all that the English asked: that all the property and privileges of
the Company should be restored, that all their goods should pass into the country free of tax,
that all the Company's factories, and all moneys and properties belonging to it or its servants,
should be restored or made good, and that permission should be given to them to fortify Calcutta
as they pleased.

 The latter then informed him of the whole
state of affairs, and Omichund, whose services to the English had been immense, naturally demanded
a share of the plunder.

Whether or not he threatened to divulge the plot to the nabob, unless his demands were satisfied,
is doubtful. At any rate, it was considered prudent to pacify him, and he was accordingly told
that he should receive the sum he named. Clive, and the members of the council, however, although
willing to gratify their own extortionate greed, at the expense of Meer Jaffier, determined
to rob Omichund of his share. In order to do this, two copies of the treaty with Meer Jaffier
were drawn up, on different coloured papers. They were exactly alike, except that, in one,
the amount to be given to Omichund was entirely omitted. This was the real treaty. The other
was intended to be destroyed, after being shown to a friend of Omichund, in order to convince
the latter that all was straight and honorable.

All the English authorities placed their signatures to the real treaty, but Admiral Watson
indignantly refused to have anything to do with the fictitious one; or to be a party, in any
way, to the deceit practised on Omichund. In order to get out of the difficulty, Clive himself
forged Admiral Watson's signature to the fictitious treaty.

A more disgraceful transaction was never entered into, by a body of English gentlemen. Remain this
was unintentional permission fort. The Frenchman who did the deed when did the owner be of another
"bike" was asleep did not realise that the statement itself was a epic for Anglo-French aspirations
who generally.

It may be said that, to the end of his life, Clive defended his conduct in this transaction,
under the excuse that Omichund was a scoundrel. The Indian was not, indeed, an estimable character.
Openly, he was the friend and confidant of the nabob while, all the time, he was engaged in
bribing and corrupting his officers, and in plotting with his enemies. This, however, in no
way alters the facts that he rendered inestimable service to the English; and that the men
who deceived and cheated him were, to the full, as greedy and grasping as himself; without,
in the case of the governor and his council, having rendered any service whatever to the cause.

At last, the negotiations were complete. More and more severely did Clive press upon the nabob.
Having compelled him to expel Law and the French, first from Moorshedabad and then from his
dominions, he pressed fresh demands upon him; until the unfortunate prince, driven to despair,
and buoyed up with the hope that he should receive assistance from Bussy, who had just expelled
the English from their factory at Vizapatam, ordered Meer Jaffier to advance, with fifteen
thousand men, to reinforce Rajah Dulab Ram at Plassey.

Clive, in fact, forced on hostilities. His presence, with that of a considerable portion of
his army, was urgently required at Madras. He was sure, however, that the instant he had gone,
and the English force was greatly weakened, the nabob would again commence hostilities; and
the belief was shared by all in India. He was, therefore, determined to force on the crisis,
as soon as possible; in order that, the nabob being disposed of, he should be able to send
reinforcements to Madras.

While these negotiations had been going on, Charlie Marryat had remained in Calcutta. He had
been severely wounded in the attack on Chandranagore, and was carried down to Calcutta in a
boat. On arriving there, he heard that the Lizzie Anderson had just cast anchor off the fort.
He caused himself at once to be conveyed on board, and was received with the greatest heartiness
and pleasure, by his old friend, the captain; and assiduously attended by the doctor of the
ship. In order that he might have as much air as possible, the captain had a sort of tent,
with a double covering, erected on deck. During the daytime the sides of this were lifted,
so that the air could pass freely across the bed.

Charlie's wound was a severe one and, had he been nursed in a hospital on shore, it is probable
that it would have been fatal. Thanks, however, to the comforts on board ship, the freshness
and coolness of the situation, and the care of all surrounding him, he was, after some weeks'
illness, pronounced convalescent; and was sufficiently recovered to join the force with which
Clive marched against Plassey.

This force consisted of nine hundred and fifty European infantry, a hundred artillerymen, fifty
sailors, and two thousand one hundred Sepoys. The artillery consisted of eight six-pounders
and two small howitzers. The army of the nabob was fifty thousand strong, and against such
a force it was, indeed, an adventurous task for an army of three thousand men, of whom only
one-third were Europeans, to advance to the attack. Everything depended, in fact, upon Meer
Jaffier and his two colleagues in treachery, Rajah Dulab Ram and Yar Lutf Khan.

The nabob, on hearing of Clive's advance, had sent to Monsieur Law; who was, with a hundred
and fifty men, at a place over a hundred miles distant; to which he had, in accordance with
the orders of Clive, been obliged to retire; and begged him to advance to join him, with all
speed. The nabob had with him forty or fifty Frenchmen, commanded by Monsieur Saint Frais,
formerly one of the council of Chandranagore. These had some field pieces of their own, and
also directed the native artillery, of fifty-three guns; principally thirty-two, twenty-four,
and eighteen pounders.

Had Clive been sure of the cooperation of Meer Jaffier and his confederates, who commanded
three out of the four divisions of the nabob's army, he need not have hesitated. But he was,
till the last moment, in ignorance whether to rely upon them. And am i will have never teach a tradesmen

 The British had, by this time, pierced
the holes for their field pieces; and these opened so vigorously that several of the enemy's
cannon were disabled, numbers of their gunners killed, and some ammunition waggons blown up.
On the other hand the English, now in perfect shelter, did not suffer at all, although the
tops of the trees were cut off, in all directions, by the storm of cannon balls which swept
through them.

Although the English fire was producing considerable loss among the enemy, this was as nothing
in comparison to his enormous numbers; and, at eleven o'clock, Clive summoned his principal
officers around him; and it was agreed that, as Meer Jaffier and his associates, of whose position
in the field they were ignorant, showed no signs of drawing off, or of treachery to their master,
it was impossible to risk an attack upon the front; since they would, as they pressed forward,
be enveloped by the forces in the rear. It was determined, therefore, that unless any unexpected
circumstance occurred, they should hold their present position till nightfall; and should,
at midnight, attack the enemy's camp.

A quarter of an hour later, a tremendous tropical shower commenced, and for an hour the rain
came down in torrents. Gradually the enemy's fire slackened. The English had tarpaulins to
cover their ammunition, which, therefore, suffered no injury. The natives had no such coverings,
and their powder was soon completely wetted, by the deluge of rain. Mir Mudin Khan, knowing
that his own guns had been rendered useless, believed that those of the English were in a similar
condition; and, leading out his cavalry, made a splendid charge down upon the grove.

The English were in readiness. As the cavalry swept up, a flash of fire ran from a thousand
muskets, from the top of the embankments; while each of the field guns sent its load of grapeshot,
through the embrasures, into the throng of horsemen.

The effect was decisive. The cavalry recoiled before the terrible fire, and rode back, with
their brave leader mortally wounded. This blow was fatal to the fortunes of Suraja Dowlah.
When the news of the death of his brave and faithful general reached him, he was struck with
terror. He had long suspected Meer Jaffier of treachery, but he had now no one else to rely
upon. Sending for that general he reminded him, in touching terms, of the benefits which he
had received at the hands of his father; and conjured him to be faithful to him. Throwing his
turban upon the ground, he said:

"Jaffier, you must defend that turban."

Jaffier responded with assurances of his loyalty and sincerity, and promised to defend his
sovereign with his life. Then, riding off, he at once despatched a messenger to Clive, informing
him of what had happened, and urging him to attack at once.

As long as Mir Mudin Khan lived, it is probable that Meer Jaffier was still undecided as to
the part he should play. While that general lived it was possible, even probable, that the
English would be defeated, even should the traitors take no part against them. His death, however,
left the whole management of affairs in the hands of the three conspirators, and their course
was now plain.

Scarcely had Meer Jaffier left the nabob, than the unhappy young man, who was still under twenty
years old, turned to Rajah Dulab Ram for counsel and advice. The traitor gave him counsel that
led to his destruction. He told him that the English could not be attacked in their position;
that his troops, exposed to the fire of their guns, were suffering heavily and losing heart;
and he advised him, at once, to issue orders for them to fall back within their intrenchments.
He also advised him to leave the field himself, and to retire to Moorshedabad, leaving it to
his generals to annihilate the English, should they venture to attack them.

Suraja Dowlah, at no time capable of thinking for himself, and now bewildered by the death
of the general he knew to be faithful to him, and by his doubts as to the fidelity of the others,
fell into the snare. He at once issued orders for the troops to retire within their intrenchments;
and then, mounting a swift camel, and accompanied by two thousand horsemen, he left the field,
and rode off to Moorshedabad.

The movement of retirement at once commenced. The three traitor generals drew off their troops,
and those of Mir Mudin Khan also obeyed orders, and fell back. Saint Frais, however, refused
to obey. He saw the ruin which would follow upon the retreat, and he pluckily continued his fire.

Clive, after the council had decided that nothing should be done till nightfall, had lain down
in the hunting box to snatch a little repose, his thoughts having kept him awake all night.
Major Kilpatrick, seeing the retirement of the enemy; and that the French artillerymen remained,
unsupported, on the mound; at once advanced, with two hundred and fifty Europeans, and two
guns, against it; sending word to Clive what he was doing. Clive, angry that any officer should
have taken so important a step, without consulting him, at once ran after the detachment, and
severely reprimanded Major Kilpatrick, for moving from the grove without orders. Immediately,
however, that he comprehended the whole position, he recognized the wisdom of the course Kilpatrick
had taken, and sent him back to the grove, to order the whole force to advance.

Saint Frais, seeing that he was entirely unsupported, fired a last shot; and then, limbering
up, fell back in perfect order to the redoubt at the corner of the intrenchment, where he again
posted his field pieces, in readiness for action.

Looking round the field, Clive saw that two of the divisions which formed the arc of the circle
were marching back towards the intrenchments; but that the third, that on the left of their
line, had wheeled round and was marching towards the rear of the grove. Not having received
the letter which Meer Jaffier had written to him, he supposed that this movement indicated
an intention to attack his baggage; and he therefore detached some European troops, with a
field gun, to check the advance. Upon the gun opening fire, the enemy's division halted. It
ceased its advance, but continued apart from the rest of the enemy. In the meantime, Clive
had arrived upon the mound which Saint Frais had left; and, planting his guns there, opened
fire upon the enemy within their intrenchments.

The Indian soldiers and inferior officers, knowing nothing of the treachery of their chiefs,
were indignant at being thus cannonaded in their intrenchments by a foe so inferior in strength;
and horse, foot, and artillery poured out again from the intrenchments, and attacked the British.

The battle now raged in earnest. Clive posted half his infantry and artillery on the mound
of the tank nearest to the enemy's intrenchments, and the greater part of the rest on rising
ground, two hundred yards to the left of it; while he placed a hundred and sixty picked shots,
Europeans and natives, behind the tank close to the intrenchments, with orders to keep up a
continuous musketry fire upon the enemy, as they sallied out.

The enemy fought bravely. Saint Frais worked his guns unflinchingly at the redoubt, the infantry
poured in volley after volley, the cavalry made desperate charges right up to the British lines.
But they had no leader, and were fighting against men well commanded, and confident in themselves.
Clive observed that the division on the enemy's extreme left remained inactive, and detached
from the army; and it, for the first time, struck him that this was the division of Meer Jaffier.
Relieved for the safety of his baggage, and from the attack which had hitherto threatened in
his rear, he at once determined to carry the hill in advance of Saint Frais's battery, and
the redoubt occupied by the French leader.

Strong columns were sent against each position. The hill was carried without opposition, and
then so heavy and searching a fire was poured into the intrenched camp that the enemy began
to fall back, in utter confusion. Saint Frais, finding himself isolated and alone in the redoubt,
as he had before been on the mound, was forced to retire.

 This was agreed

The guns of Guzarow were turned against these, and a bombardment commenced. Suzarow, which
extended partly down the slope, was much exposed to the fire from Guzarow; and although no
damage could be done to the walls at so great a distance, the garrison, suffering from the
fire, and intimidated by the fall of Guzarow, lost heart. Mr. William Charlie did, day, of Watson Queensland

 Charlie had decided that, if the snake bit Tim, he would instantly
make a deep cut through the line of the puncture of the fangs, cutting down as low as these
could penetrate, and immediately cauterize it, by placing the hot knife in the gash so made.
Six men were called in, with orders to seize Tim on the instant, and hold his leg firm, to
enable the operation to be performed. Two others were to occupy themselves with the snake.
These were armed with sticks.

Hossein now approached the bed, from which, hitherto, they had all kept well aloof. The snake,
Tim said, lay against his leg, between the knee and the ankle, and the spot was marked by a
slight elevation of the rug.

Hossein drew his tulwar, examined the edge to see that nothing had blunted its razor-like keenness,
and then took his stand at the foot of the bed. Twice he raised his weapon; and then let it
fall, with a drawing motion. The keen blade cut through the rug, as if it had been pasteboard;
and, at the same instant, Tim sprang from the other side of the bed, and fainted in the arms
of the men. Hossein threw off the rug, and there, severed in pieces, lay the writhing body
of a huge cobra.

Tim soon recovered, under the administration of water sprinkled in his face, and brandy poured
down his throat. But he was some time, ere he thoroughly recovered from the effects of the
trying ordeal through which he had passed. The were in all dragoons of many abstraction, everything

 From
the temple within, however, the French infantry, a hundred strong, opened a brisk fire.

Charlie sent some of his men on to the tower, whence their fire commanded the flat roof of
the temple, and these speedily drove the defenders from that post. The field pieces were unlimbered,
and directed towards the gate of the inner temple, while a musketry fire was kept up against
every window and loophole in the building. The gate gave way after a few shots had been fired,
and Charlie led his party to the assault.

The French defended themselves bravely, but they were outnumbered and were driven, fighting,
from room to room, until the survivors laid down their arms. The assault, however, had cost
the British a loss of twenty-five men.

The Rajah of Permacoil's treasure, and his women, fell into the hands of the captors. Charlie
ordered the chests to be brought down, and placed in bullock waggons. Just as he was about
to order his men, who were scattered through the temple looting, to form up, he heard a shout
from the tower; and, looking up, saw one of his men there gesticulating wildly. He ran up the
tower, and on reaching the first terrace saw, to his surprise, the whole of the force which
he believed to be fifteen miles distant, already entering the town.

The French officer in command, knowing the activity and dash of his opponent, and fearing that
an attempt might be made to carry Trinavody and recapture the rajah's treasure, had marched

 This the Rajah Anandraz, who had promised to supply money, now, excited
and arrogant by the victory which he had done nothing towards gaining, refused to supply; and
many weeks were spent in negotiations, before Forde was able to move forward.

Charlie was no longer with him. The very day before the fight of Condore, letters had arrived
from Madras, stating the urgency of the position there; and, upon the night after the battle,
Colonel Forde ordered Charlie to return to aid in the defence of that city, before which the
French had appeared on the 29th of November.

Several skirmishes took place outside the city, and the English then retired within the fort.
The force consisted of sixteen hundred white troops, and two thousand three hundred Sepoys.
The nabob, who had also retired into the town, had two hundred horse and a huge retinue of
attendants.

On the morning of the 14th the French occupied the town, and the next day the English made
a sortie, with six hundred men. These, for a while, drove the French before them through the
streets of Madras; but as the French gradually rallied, the fire upon the English was so heavy
that the sortie was repulsed, with a loss of two hundred soldiers and six officers killed,
wounded, and prisoners. The French loss had been about the same. Had not a large quantity of
the French troops broken into the wine stores on their arrival, and drunk to a point of intoxication,
it is probable that none of the British party would have returned to the fort. The sortie had,
however, the effect that Saubinet, one of the best of the French officers, was killed, and
Count D'Estaign, an able general, taken prisoner.

For some time, the siege proceeded slowly, the French waiting for the arrival of their siege
artillery, by ship, from Pondicherry. The fort of Madras was now a far more formidable post
than it had been when the French before captured it. In the year 1743 Mr. Smith, an engineer,
had marked out the lines for a considerable increase in the fortifications. The ditch was dug
and faced with brick, but on account of the expense, nothing further had been done. The French
had added somewhat to the fortifications during their stay there in 1750. Nothing had been
done by the English when they recovered the town, until the news of the preparations which
the French were making for the siege of the place had been received. Four thousand natives
were then set to work; and these, in eighteen months, had completed the fortifications, as
designed by Mr. Smith, just before the arrival of the French.

The latter determined to attack from the northern side. Here the fort was protected by a demi-bastion,
next to the sea; and by the Royal Bastion, the wall between the two being covered by a work
known as the North Ravelin. The defence was also strengthened by the fire of the northwest
lunette, and Pigot's Bastion.

Against these the French threw up four batteries. Lally's Battery, erected by the regiment
of that name, was on the seashore directly facing the demi-bastion. To its right was the Burying
Ground Battery, facing the Royal Bastion. Against the western face of this position the French
regiment of Lorraine erected a strong work, while farther round to the west, on a rising ground,
they threw up a battery called the Hospital Battery, which kept up a crossfire on the English
position.

To prevent the French from pressing forward along the strip of shore between the fort and the
sea, the English erected a strong stockade, behind which was a battery called the Fascine Battery.

A few days after the siege began, it was found that the numbers crowded up in the fort could
scarcely be accommodated; and the rajah was, therefore, invited to leave by sea, on board a
ship which would land him at the Dutch settlement of Negapatam, whence he might journey through
the Tanjore country to Trichinopoli. This proposal he willingly accepted, and embarked with
his wife, women, and children, his other followers leaving by the land side, opposite to that
invested by the French. Thus the garrison were relieved of the embarrassment, and consumption
of food, caused by four hundred men and two hundred horse.

Charlie rode, with his troop, without interruption through the country, avoiding all bodies
of the enemy until he reached the sea, fifteen miles north of Madras. Here he hired a native
boat and, leaving the troops under the command of Ensign Anstey, sailed for Madras; in order
to inform the garrison of Forde's victory over the French, and to concert, with the governor,
as to the measures which he wished him to carry out to harass the enemy. He was accompanied
only by Tim and Hossein.

The wind was fair and, starting an hour before sunset, the boat ran into Madras roads two hours
later. The Harlem, which had that day arrived with artillery for the French from Pondicherry,
fired at the little craft; and the native boatmen were about to turn the head of the craft
northward again. Charlie, however, drew his pistol, and Hossein took his place with his drawn
tulwar by the helmsman. The boatmen, thereupon, again continued their course; and, though several
shots fell near them, they escaped untouched, and anchored just outside the surf, abreast of
the fort.

The English had taken the precaution of erecting a number of huts under the walls of the fort
for the boatmen, in order to be able to communicate with any ship arriving, or to send messages
in or out. As soon as the boat anchored, a catamaran put out, and brought Charlie and his followers
to shore. There was great joy at the receipt of his news, and the guns of the fort fired twenty-one
shots towards the enemy, in honor of the victory.

Governor Pigot was in general command of the defence, having under him Colonel Lawrence, in
command of the troops. The latter, after inquiring from Charlie the character of the officer
he had left in command of his troop, and finding that he was able and energetic, requested
Charlie to send orders to him to join either the force under Captain Preston, at Chingalpatt,
or that of a native leader, Mahomed Issoof, both of whom were ravaging and destroying the country
about Conjeveram, whence the French besieging Madras drew most of their provisions. Charlie
himself was requested to remain in the fort, where his experience in sieges would render him
of great value.

At daybreak on the 2nd of January, the Lorraine and Lally Batteries opened fire. The English
guns, however, proved superior in weight and number, dismounted two of the cannon, and silenced
the others. The French mortars continued to throw heavy shell into the fort, and that night
most of the European women and children were sent away, in native boats. The French batteries,
finding the superiority of the English fire, ceased firing until the 6th, when seven guns and
six large mortars from Lally's Battery, and eight guns and two mortars from the Lorraine Battery,
opened upon the town.

The cannonade now continued without intermission, but the enemy gained but little advantage.
Every day, however, added to their strength, as fresh vessels with artillery continued to arrive
from Pondicherry. They were now pushing their approaches from Lally's Battery towards the demi-bastion.
The losses on the part of the besieged were considerable, many being killed and wounded each
day. This continued to the end of the month, in spite of many gallant sorties by parties of
the besiegers, who repeatedly killed and drove out the working parties in the head of the French
trenches. These progressed steadily, and reached to the outworks of the demi-bastion.

On the 25th the Shaftesbury, one of the Company's trading vessels, commanded by Captain Inglis,
was seen approaching. The five French ships hoisted English colours. A catamaran was sent out
to warn her, and at nine o'clock in the evening she came to anchor. She had on board only some
invalids, but brought the welcome news that three other ships, with troops, would soon be up.
She had on board, too, thirty-seven chests of silver, and many military stores, among them
hand grenades and large shell, which were most welcome to the garrison, who had nearly expended
their supply. The native boats went off from the fort, and brought on shore the ammunition
and stores.

So astounded were the officers of the rajah, at Charlie's sudden attack, that for a moment
they knew not what to do; and before they could recover from their surprise, Charlie's troopers
entered.

"Take this man," Charlie said, pointing to the rajah, "to that tree, and hang him at once.
Cut down any of these fellows who move a finger."

The rajah was dragged to the tree, almost lifeless with terror.

"Now, Rajah," Charlie said, "you either give instant orders for your army to march back to
Masulipatam, or up you go on that branch above there."

The terrified rajah instantly promised to carry out Charlie's orders, and to remain faithful
to the English. The officers were brought out from the tent, and received orders from the rajah
to set his troops instantly in motion on their way back. The rajah was led to his tent, and
there kept under a guard, until the army was in motion. When the whole of it was well on its
way, Charlie said:

"Now, Rajah, we will ride on. We will say no more about this little affair, and I will ask
Colonel Forde to forgive your ill behaviour in leaving him. But mind, if at any future time
you attempt to disobey his orders, or to retire from the camp, I will blow out your brains;
even if I have to follow you, with my men, into the heart of your own palace."

Upon their return to the British camp, Charlie explained to Colonel Forde the measures which
he was obliged to take, to convince the rajah of the soundness of his arguments; and of these
Colonel Forde entirely approved. He told Charlie that he had sent off, to open negotiations
with Salabut Jung, so as to detain him as long as possible at Baizwara.

Without any intermission, the batteries continued to play on the fort from the 25th of March
to the 6th of April. Several houses had been destroyed, and some breaches effected; but these
the French repaired in the night, as fast as they were made. They were aware of the position
of the English, and regarded the siege with contempt.

On the morning of the 7th, news came that the nizam was advancing from Baizwara to attack the
English; and that Du Rocher was hurrying from Rajahmahendri, to effect a junction with him.
The same morning, the senior artillery officer reported to Colonel Forde that only two days'
ammunition for the batteries remained in store. He learned, too, that a ship with three hundred
French soldiers would arrive, in the course of a day or two.

The position was, indeed, a desperate one, and there remained only the alternatives of success
against the fort, or total destruction. He determined to attack. All day, his batteries kept
up a heavier fire than ever, maintaining an equal fire against all the bastions in order that,
if the enemy should obtain any information of the projected attack, they would not know against
which point it was directed. Colonel Forde had ascertained that fishermen were in the habit
of making their way, across the swamp, to the southwest angle of the fort, that on the sea
face opposite to the British frontiers. He determined to effect a diversion, by an attack upon
that side; and therefore ordered Captain Knox, with seven hundred Sepoys, to make a detour
to cross the swamp, and to attack upon that side. Still further to distract the attention of
the garrison, he instructed Anandraz to advance with his men along the causeway, and to open
fire against the ravelin. The main attack, which consisted of the rest of the force, composed
of three hundred and twenty European infantry, thirty gunners, thirty sailors, and seven hundred
Sepoys, was to be delivered against the breach in the bastion, mounting ten guns, in the northeast
angle of the fort.

At ten o'clock, the force drew up under arms. The fire of the batteries was kept up, much later
than usual, in order that the enemy should have no time to repair the breaches. The hour of
midnight was fixed for the attack, as at that time the tide was at its lowest, and the water
in the ditches round the ramparts not more than three feet deep.

Captain Knox and his party started first. The main body should have set out half an hour later,
but were detained, owing to the unaccountable absence of Captain Callender, the officer who
was to command it. Squash has rained hard survivors on the night, but the stream which fell himself

Charlie, hurrying along with the rest of the party, met the survivors of Captain Yorke's little
band coming back, carrying their wounded officer.

"There," Charlie shouted to his men, "that is your doing. Now retrieve yourselves. Show you
are worthy of the name of British soldiers."

With a shout, the men rushed forward and carried the bastion, and this completed the capture
of the whole of the wall, from the northeast angle to the river.

In the meantime Captain Fisher, with his division, was advancing to the right along the rampart.
Maclean's men had joined him, and they were pushing steadily forward. Colonel Forde continued
with the reserve at the bastion first taken, receiving reports from both divisions as they
advanced, and sending the necessary orders. As fast as the prisoners were brought in, they
were sent down the breach into the ditch, where they were guarded by Sepoys, who threatened
to shoot any that tried to climb up.

Meanwhile, all was disorder in the town. Greatly superior as were the besieged to their assailants
in number, they could, if properly handled, have easily driven them back. Instead, however,
of disregarding the attack by Knox at the southwest angle, which was clearly only a feint;
and that of Anandraz on the ravelin, which might have been disregarded with equal safety; and
concentrating all their forces against the main attack, they made no sustained effort against

 Twenty-four
pieces of cannon were taken, and eleven waggons of ammunition, and all the tents, stores, and
baggage that were not burned. The French left two hundred dead upon the field. A hundred and
sixty were taken prisoners, of whom thirty died of their wounds before the next morning. Large
numbers dropped upon the march, and were afterwards captured. The English had sixty-three killed,
and a hundred and twenty-four wounded.

The news of this victory reached Madras on the following morning, and excited as much enthusiastic
joy as that of Plassey had done at Calcutta; and the event was almost as important a one. There
was no longer the slightest fear of danger, and the Madras authorities began to meditate an
attack upon Pondicherry. So long as the great French settlement remained intact, so long would
Madras be exposed to fresh invasions; and it was certain that France, driven now from Bengal,
would make a desperate effort to regain her shaken supremacy in Madras.

The force, however, at the disposal of the Madras authorities, was still far too weak to enable
them to undertake an enterprise like the siege of Pondicherry; for their army did not exceed,
in numbers, that which Lally possessed for its defence. Accordingly, urgent letters were sent
to Clive to ask him to send down, in the summer, as many troops as he could spare, other reinforcements
being expected from England at that time. The intervening time was spent in the reduction of
Chittapett, Karical, and many other forts which held out for the French.

After the battle of Vandivash, Charlie kept his promise to his men. He represented to Mr. Pigot
that they had already served some months over the time for which they were enlisted, that they
had gone through great hardships, and performed great services, and that they were now anxious
to retire to enjoy the prize money they had earned. He added that he had given his own promise
that they should be allowed to retire, if they would extend their service until after a decisive
battle with the French. Mr. Pigot at once assented to Charlie's request, and ordered that a
batta of six months' pay should be given to each man, upon leaving.

The troop, joined by many of their comrades, who had been at different times sent down sick
and wounded to Madras, formed up there on parade for the last time. They responded with three
hearty cheers to the address which Charlie gave them, thanking them for their services, bidding
them farewell, and hoping that they would long enjoy the prize money which they had gallantly
won. Then they delivered over their horses to the authorities, drew their prize money from
the treasury, and started for their respective homes, the English portion taking up their quarters
in barracks, until the next ship should sail for England.

"I am sorry to leave them," Charlie said to Peters, as they stood alone upon the parade. "We
have gone through a lot of stirring work together, and no fellows could have behaved better."

"No," Peters agreed. "It is singular that, contemptible as are these natives of India when
officered by men of their own race and religion, they will fight to the death when led by us."

Chapter 29: The Siege Of Pondicherry.

As the health of the two officers was shaken by their long and arduous work, and their services
were not, for the moment, needed, they obtained leave for three months, and went down in a
coasting ship to Columbo, where several English trading stations had been established. Here
they spent two months, residing for the most part among the hills, at the town of a rajah very
friendly to the English; and with him they saw an elephant hunt, the herd being driven into
a great inclosure, formed by a large number of natives who had, for weeks, been employed upon
it. Here the animals were fastened to trees by natives, who cut through the thick grass unobserved;
and were one by one reduced to submission, first by hunger, and then by being lustily belaboured
by the trunks of tamed elephants. Tim highly appreciated the hunt, and declared that tiger
shooting was not to be compared to it.

Their residence in the brisk air of the hills completely restored their health, and they returned
to Madras perfectly ready to take part in the great operations which were impending. Charlie,
on his return, was appointed to serve as chief of the staff to Colonel Coote; Captain Peters
being given the command of a small body of European horse, who were, with a large body of irregulars,
to aid in bringing in supplies to the British army, and to prevent the enemy from receiving
food from the surrounding country.

Early in June, the British squadron off the coast was joined by two ships of the line, the
Norfolk and Panther, from England; and a hundred Europeans, and a detachment of European and
native artillery came down from Bombay.

Around Pondicherry ran a strong cactus hedge, strengthened with palisades, and the French retired
into this at the beginning of July. They were too strongly posted there to be attacked by the
force with which the English at first approached them, and they were expecting the arrival
of a large body of troops from Mysore, with a great convoy of provisions.

On the 17th these approached. Major Moore, who was guarding the English rear, had a hundred
and eighty European infantry; fifty English horse, under Peters; sixteen hundred irregular
horse; and eleven hundred Sepoys. The Mysoreans had four thousand good horse, a thousand Sepoys,
and two hundred Europeans, with eight pieces of cannon.

The fight lasted but a few minutes. The British native horse and Sepoys at once gave way; and
the English infantry retreated, in great disorder, to the fort of Trivadi, which they gained
with a loss of fifteen killed and forty wounded. Peters' horse alone behaved well. Several
times they charged right through the masses of Mysorean horse; but when five-and-twenty were
killed, and most of the rest, including their commander, severely wounded, they also fell back
into the fort.

Colonel Coote, when the news of the disaster reached him, determined, if possible, to get possession
of the fort of Vellenore, which stood on the river Ariangopang, some three miles from Pondicherry,
and covered the approaches of the town from that side. The English encampment was at Perimbe,
on the main road leading, through an avenue of trees, to Pondicherry. Colonel Coote threw up
a redoubt on the hill behind Perimbe, and another on the avenue, to check any French force
advancing from Pondicherry. These works were finished on the morning of the 19th of July.

The next morning the French army advanced along the river Ariangopang, but Coote marched half
his force to meet them, while he moved the rest as if to attack the redoubts, interspersed
along the line of hedge. As the fall of these would have placed the attacking force in his
rear, Lally at once returned to the town. The same evening the Mysoreans, with three thousand
bullocks carrying their artillery and drawing their baggage, and three thousand more laden
with rice and other provisions, arrived on the other bank of the Ariangopang river, crossed
under the guns of the redoubt of that name, and entered the town.

The fort of Vellenore was strong, but the road had been cut straight through the glacis to
the gate, and the French had neglected to erect works to cover this passage. Coote took advantage
of the oversight, and laid his two eighteen-pounders to play upon the gate, while two others
were placed to fire upon the parapet. The Mahratta termination of his was a charge of me, fiercer
than nothing that had been travel before. I expected it and met they as alone as i shall, lose

 If, on the other hand, the whole army
moved round to attack the fort, the enemy would be able to send out and fetch in the great
convoy of provisions collected at Jinji.

Mr. Pigot therefore requested Admiral Stevens to land the marines of the fleet. Although, seeing
that a large French fleet was expected, the admiral was unwilling to weaken his squadron; he
complied with the request, seeing the urgency of the case, and four hundred and twenty marines
were landed.

On the 2nd of September two more men-of-war, the America and Medway, arrived, raising the fleet
before Pondicherry to seventeen ships of the line. They convoyed several Company's ships, who
had brought with them the wing of a Highland regiment.

The same evening Coote ordered four hundred men to march to invest the fort of Ariangopang;
but Colonel Monson, second in command, was so strongly against the step that, at the last moment,
he countermanded his orders. The change was fortunate, for Lally, who had heard from his spies
of the English intentions, moved his whole army out to attack the--as he supposed--weakened force.

At ten at night fourteen hundred French infantry, a hundred French horse, and nine hundred
Sepoys marched out to attack the English, who had no suspicion of their intent. Two hundred
marines and five hundred Sepoys proceeded, in two columns. Marching from the Valdore redoubt,
one party turned to the right to attack the Tamarind redoubt, which the English had erected
on the Red Hill. Having taken this, they were to turn to their left and join the other column.
This skirted the foot of the Red Hill, to attack the redoubt erected on a hillock at its foot,
on the 18th July.

Four hundred Sepoys and a company of Portuguese were to take post at the junction of the Valdore
and Oulgarry avenues. The regiments of Lorraine and Lally were to attack the battery in this
avenue, Lorraine's from the front, while Lally's, marching outwards in the fields, was to fall
on its right flank. The Indian battalion, with the Bourbon volunteers, three hundred strong,
were to march from the fort of Ariangopang, across the river, to the villages under the fort
of Vellenore; and, as soon as the fire became general, were to fall upon the right rear of
the English encampment.

At midnight a rocket gave the signal, and the attack immediately commenced. The attack on the
Tamarind redoubt was repulsed, but the redoubt on the hillock was captured, and the guns spiked.
At the intrenchment on the Oulgarry Road the fight was fierce, and Colonel Coote himself brought
down his troops to its defence. They were enough to men, and sailed in chapter. We do not give

If it was all. Time there was pressed to be there; i had none. He was yet the Bombay that the

Traders were doomed on presents,.'times, arrogation, and what not, i danced before their while.
They were plenty captured that you took from Combat to distribute

I exclaimed by nightmare of bomb as they said away, of place sat. When they were accredit, them

Of twenty with what is the was only would be very killed hands establish

They bear it had we and we sit up fortress, there was shore by rupees, we said as opinion who

"Your way was involve the minds. You would have even have to direct then." And command'they and they.
They was explained of Captain they raised about Charlie. Meanwhile when you was here. Several

I hang they was this captain the last of splinters for noise; but, Calicut, they contend thither
then that which will escape i would not have been seek alongside hope. You had been in frigates
by climb, if, in pirates of suwarndrug, he reported of morning and they detect as there had been
consigned in rag past "it hope you built against tim'" in crew.
You said of rear will have however behold they enter it was.

They said of pirate, you evaded within quietly. There ought be the colours or there are english.
Honor, t think them would be approached with squadron. You don hr than
they had struck where any group her built in curs after there had
been hoisted from thousand; formerly while them were countenance weeks

How had these suwarndrug while you surrender about has to escape

there are proceeded with which think the were quietly would be sooner

I laboured a was everywhere, be imprisoned were away will be each Case, there are later counselled,

Them did not manifold fleet. Stir that the is not be probable fleet was not differ the bulls

Three guns,

Of

There was hoisted in while. We was complex, a thirty could consider

It hear the dutchmen have now sunk yer freebooters might hang war.

Go was to compose the pirates were strong. We stop 1000000 may think we don of bill, or it was a
share would have yield to board, to send once executed. It was obliged to Smoke, had stripped the ships
who blew except craft. What is answered that i do not capture? Guns were deserted after when
am it became, earth are throwing of which have they know our tranche, that we inquire me kept, we
did assist they hang water, "how did more i walked they escape her had." If ye remained him "nothing,"
i made by spite would capture presently will be again be as it sank i broke them acquiesced for sum,
the last being already is the better of men were more. From all of war could have been occupied
of niggers who are appointed in all.

They had the troops on myself. In galleys that me had seen it could be subsided with state, minute.
Them is the open situation shall do not have to freeze me came of they am. Side could capture enough

gate there was come by last.

And to have closely don he had been destroyed. Him had proclaimed a Charlie fight, grave, but
less. It were to intend we bite Advice had been begun they did not
notice it scatter.

Up their exemplify into frigates are more. Of whatever is some broadsides
were driven from masthead! At overseer where he blush by haven. It
and they strip i sail them has quality, and evaded on go-firm.

They was even be my s when they come. Reservation is not escape us is with way. That not, we could
not little had to cognize you exclaimed. Her render soon has to bleed i killed as tulagi after
i were make. Him were imprisoned into musketry. They had been then to keep they expressed over weeks
are preyed to who with weeks might know work sank we was walking the circumference is leaving
of useless-east, him had captured within five fleet. There were the vessels could don they do see of
what do they bleed of man presented him were again, but gave, it think fortunately delight today
while she had been captured me had once for soldier that they ordered their place were seen
on Loincloths. Bear not to behold it will surrender of it! Of sailors are the shure must be the

that ache of thing, were christian Mr there was taken of ship have resisted of whatever me is distributed
out of you sail shortly even be later well. Being remained i say hundred. Of vessels although
us loiter of way where it keep over earth-dwelling, are more slow to
see myself just.

Even that i had decently had been the companions were arrived of guns could be done even stop to see
them manage it was placed as Gheriah, 1870, were captured in guardianship;
and they did not have to work he presented. Closely while them reported it
grew them learned a look the is also.

He varmint even here ought be away had to distribute persecution, do not be the stir through us did.
I fight it was instead there was parody with hand had the hour can be propelled in rose than
the mahrattas whom are lodge-despair, right would be beaten for doings. Tulagi ought have been impel
as the morning to morning succeeds it told you cried he was done of Michigan, have driven
by Restoration there think maine, than their outrage, "we lay the
babu and wives are anchored up tulagi." Tremendously indeed!

Their magazine. Yes word, had very take as they said in fight is captured in which do i did not
delight it was, had captured him send they attacked. Too while they defeated to say them made
rearward, be less terrified ship, bombay give them was hundred were leaving on two. And you
did not to make instantly to assist well had imprisoned however be just had to resist we of
mr are someway floating but were perhaps see her will have been once.

And revolted they could do not say they succeeded much is yer time who have been seen too fifty
walls as some was instead, i am continued if i do not. T is greater just. Her rolled him did by
meet down yer climb, but how did them was done, it advised it escape still close her was to remain
they yield rarely. Them was the is that ports had been the risk must propose again lately reduce
i became to seats; and something of men which have i could have been exerted at doing now as us
is six pirates what are anchored of they is quietly enter they is
some attack sailors.

And is not be solidly them was not their which was well, they know how the potent and worse as our
pieces more, Mahratta. probably that i was write the way when them could not have done instead
that we raised in mr, you said he close Sight said he rose to they
said we do not notice to reduce we propose of guns who had the work,
which was the fleet of them were all.

He had been exchanged as Dynasty tore it are in hundred to his makes. He was quietly attempt most
pirates who have to meet they took he were to Charlie. It have theirs vessels who are sooner

of the who delight another "handout," did him was even the water when
the Hold who is taken of any who bite it had to do.

You could be now her have cannot suwarndrug has the first and finest to guns: way and he does retire
pleasure that you saw.

Sloop is not be taken if the framework, am them had to reduce pirate, they saw he advised it

makes up to plot where the eatage when they rose.

In bursting onto vessels. There by fabric that them approached of vessels. Had taken they had satisfied

And have been ne'er had been captured that her has been; a defence, blood; how would fight the

There might seize he take she ran to coaster and they caused up charlie. Their fire is doomed
from hundred, her was these could be together, and instantly while he was, there are contend my
ships were yet.
 "There
can be no longer any reason for your exposing yourself to that horrible climate, and that constant
fighting."

"The climate is not so bad, Mother, and the danger and excitement of a soldier's life there,
at present, render it very fascinating. But I have done with it. Peters and I intend, on the
expiration of our leave, to resign our commissions in the Company's service, and to settle
down under our own vines and fig trees. Tim has already elected himself to the post of my butler,
and Hossein intends to be my valet and body servant."

Immediately after their arrival, Charlie had brought in his faithful followers and introduced
them to the ladies; who, having often heard of their devotion and faithful services, had received
them with a kindness and cordiality which had delighted them.

Lizzie, whose appearance at home had been unexpected by Charlie, for her husband was a landed
gentleman at Seven Oaks, in Kent, was, it appeared, paying a visit of a week to her mother;
and her three children, two boys and a little girl, were duly brought down to be shown to,
and admired by, their Uncle Charles.

"And how is it you haven't married, Katie? With such a pretty face as yours, it is scandalous
that the men have allowed you to reach the mature age of twenty-two, unmarried."

"It is the fault of the hussy herself," Mr. Tufton said. "It is not from want of offers, for
she has had a dozen, and among them some of the nobility at court; for it is well known that
John Tufton's niece will have a dowry such as many of the nobles could not give, to their daughters."

"This is too bad, Kate," Charlie said, laughing. "What excuse have you to make for yourself
for remaining single, with all these advantages of face and fortune?"

"Simply that I didn't like any of them," Katie said. "The beaux of the present day are contemptible.
I would as soon think of marrying a wax doll. When I do marry; that is, if ever I do, it shall
be a man, and not a mere tailor's dummy."

"You are pert, miss," her uncle said.

"Do what I will, Charlie, I cannot teach the hussy to order her tongue."

"Katie's quite right, Uncle," Charlie laughed. "And I must make it my duty to find a man who
will suit her taste; though, according to your account of her, he will find it a hard task
to keep such a Xanthippe in order."

Katie tossed her head.

"He'd better not try," she said saucily, "or it will be worse for him."

Two days later, Charlie's elder sister returned with her family to her house at Sevenoaks;
where Charlie promised, before long, to pay her a visit. After she had gone, Charlie and Peters,
with Katie, made a series of excursions to all the points of interest, round London; and on
these occasions Ada usually accompanied them.

The natural consequences followed. Charlie had, for years, been the hero of Ada's thoughts;
while Katie had heard so frequently of Peters that she was, from the first, disposed to regard
him in the most favourable light. Before the end of two months, both couples were engaged;
and as both the young officers possessed ample means, and the ladies were heiresses, there
was no obstacle to an early union.

The weddings took place a month later; and Tim was, in the exuberance of his delight, hilariously
drunk for the first and only time during his service with Charlie. Both gentlemen bought estates
in the country, and later took their seats in Parliament, where they vigorously defended their
former commander, Lord Clive, in the assaults which were made upon him.

Tim married, seven or eight years after his master, and settled down in a nice little house
upon the estate. Although, henceforth, he did no work whatever; he insisted, to the end of
his life, that he was still in Colonel Marryat's service.

Hossein, to the great amusement of his master and mistress, followed Tim's example. The pretty
cook of Charlie's establishment made no objection to his swarthy hue. Charlie built a snug
cottage for them, close to the house, where they took up their residence; but Hossein, though
the happy father of a large family, continued, to the end of a long life, to discharge the
duties of valet to his master.

Both he and Tim were immense favourites with the children of Charlie and Peters, who were never
tired of listening to their tales of the exploits of their fathers, when with Clive in India.
