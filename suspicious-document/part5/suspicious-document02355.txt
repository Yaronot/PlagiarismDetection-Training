 A very happy life, very free, with
no trammels of society and no fetters of custom; a simple, rustic life, which gave me no preparation
for the years that came after it.

When I was thirteen my father married again--for my sake, and mine only. My shift for my daughter's

Richard Foster was a nephew of my step-mother, the only man I was allowed to see. He was almost
twice my age; but he had pleasant manners, and a smooth, smooth tongue. I believed he loved
me, he swore it so often and so earnestly; and I was in sore need of love. Heart that has almost.

 By locking up one-third, my father had sought to provide against the
possibility of my ever being reduced to poverty. The rest was my own, to keep if I pleased;
to give up to my husband if I pleased.

At first they tried what fair words and flattery would do with me. Then they changed their
tactics. They brought me over to London, where not a creature knew me. They made me a prisoner
in dull, dreary rooms, where I had no employment and no resources. That is, the woman did it.
My husband, after settling us in a house in London, disappeared, and I saw no more of him.
I know now he wished to keep himself irresponsible for my imprisonment. She would have been
the scape-goat, had any legal difficulties arisen. He was anxious to retain all his rights over me.

I can see how subtle he was. Though my life was a daily torture, there was positively nothing
I could put into words against him--nothing that would have authorized me to seek a legal separation.
I did not know any thing of the laws, how should I? except the fact which he dinned into my
ears that he could compel me to live with him. But I know now that the best friends in the
world could not have saved me from him in any other way than the one I took. To sixpence, and life guy,

"For what reason, mam'zelle?" he asked.

"Oh! I must tell you every thing!" I cried.

"Tell me every thing," he repeated; "it shall be buried here, in my heart, as if it was buried
in the depths of the sea. I will try not to think of it even, if you bid me. I am your friend
as well as your servant."

Then leaning against his boat, for I could not control my trembling, I told him almost all
about my wretched life, from which God had delivered me, leading me to him for shelter and
comfort. He listened with his eyes cast down, never once raising them to my face, and in perfect
silence, except that once or twice he groaned within himself, and clinched his hard hands together. It

"I cannot bear to let you go in this way," he replied, without looking up. "If it had been
to marry Dr. Martin--why, then--but you have to go alone, poor little child!"

"Yes," I said, "alone."
