At her eager signal he ran forward with a light ladder, planted it against the window-sill,
and in less than a minute the twain were running toward the beach; but the creak of the ladder
had been heard, and grasping their muskets two of the men hurried out. In the track of the
moon the pursuers descried a moving form, and, without waiting to challenge, they levelled
the guns and fired. A woman's cry followed the report; then a dip of oars was heard that fast
grew fainter until it faded from hearing. On returning to the house they found the girl's room
empty, and next morning her slipper was brought in from the mud at the landing. Nobody inside
of the American lines ever learned what that shot had done, but if it failed to take a life
it robbed Cortelyou of his mind. He spent the rest of his days in a single room, chained to
a staple in the floor, tramping around and around, muttering and gesturing, and sometimes startling
the passer-by as he showed his white face and ragged beard at the window.

VAN WEMPEL'S GOOSE

Allow us to introduce Nicholas Van Wempel, of Flatbush: fat, phlegmatic, rich, and henpecked.
He would like to be drunk because he is henpecked, but the wife holds the purse-strings and
only doles out money to him when she wants groceries or he needs clothes. It was New Year's
eve, the eve of 1739, when Vrouw Van Wempel gave to her lord ten English shillings and bade
him hasten to Dr. Beck's for the fat goose that had been bespoken. "And mind you do not stop
at the tavern," she screamed after him in her shrillest tone. But poor Nicholas! As he went
waddling down the road, snapping through an ice-crust at every step, a roguish wind--or perhaps
it was one of the bugaboos that were known to haunt the shores of Gravesend Bay--snatched off
his hat and rolled it into the very doorway of the tavern that he had been warned, under terrible
penalties, to avoid.

As he bent to pick it up the door fell ajar, and a pungency of schnapps and tobacco went into
his nostrils. His resolution, if he had one, vanished. He ordered one glass of schnapps; friends
came in and treated him to another; he was bound to do as much for them; shilling by shilling
the goose money passed into the till of the landlord. Nicholas was heard to make a muttered
assertion that it was his own money anyhow, and that while he lived he would be the head of
his own house; then the mutterings grew faint and merged into snores. When he awoke it was
at the low sound of voices in the next room, and drowsily turning his head he saw there two
strangers,--sailors, he thought, from their leather jackets, black beards, and the rings in
their ears. What was that they said? Gold? On the marshes? At the old Flatlands tide-mill?
The talkers had gone before his slow and foggy brain could grasp it all, but when the idea
had fairly eaten its way into his intellect, he arose with the nearest approach to alacrity
that he had exhibited in years, and left the place. He crunched back to his home, and seeing
nobody astir went softly into his shed, where he secured a shovel and lantern, and thence continued
with all consistent speed to the tumbledown tide-mill on the marsh,--a trying journey for his
fat legs on a sharp night, but hope and schnapps impelled him.

He reached the mill, and, hastening to the cellar, began to probe in the soft, unfrozen earth.
Presently his spade struck something, and he dug and dug until he had uncovered the top of
a canvas bag,--the sort that sailors call a "round stern-chest." It took all his strength to
lug it out, and as he did so a seam burst, letting a shower of gold pieces over the ground.
He loosed the band of his breeches, and was filling the legs thereof with coin, when a tread
of feet sounded overhead and four men came down the stair. Two of them he recognized as the
fellows of the tavern. They saw the bag, the lantern, then Nicholas. Laden though he was with
gold until he could hardly budge, these pirates, for such they were, got him up-stairs, forced
him to drink hot Hollands to the success of their flag, then shot him through the window into
the creek. As he was about to make this unceremonious exit he clutched something to save himself,
and it proved to be a plucked goose that the pirates had stolen from a neighboring farm and
were going to sup on when they had scraped their gold together. He felt the water and mud close
over him; he struggled desperately; he was conscious of breathing more freely and of staggering
off at a vigorous gait; then the power of all the schnapps seemed to get into his head, and
he remembered no more until he heard his wife shrilling in his ears, when he sat up and found
himself in a snow-bank close to his house, with a featherless goose tight in his grasp.

Vrouw Van Wempel cared less about the state of her spouse when she saw that he had secured
the bird, and whenever he told his tale of the pirates she turned a deaf ear to him, for if
he had found the gold why did he not manage to bring home a few pieces of it? He, in answer,
asked how, as he had none of his own money, she could have come by the goose? He often told
his tale to sympathetic ears, and would point to the old mill to prove that it was true.

THE WEARY WATCHER

Before the opening of the great bridge sent commerce rattling up Washington Street in Brooklyn
that thoroughfare was a shaded and beautiful avenue, and among the houses that attested its
respectability was one, between Tillary and Concord Streets, that was long declared to be haunted.
A man and his wife dwelt there who seemed to be fondly attached to each other, and whose love
should have been the stronger because of their three children none grew to years. A mutual
sorrow is as close a tie as a common affection. One day, while on a visit to a friend, the
wife saw her husband drive by in a carriage with a showy woman beside him. She went home at
once, and when the supposed recreant returned she met him with bitter reproaches. He answered
never a word, but took his hat and left the house, never to be seen again in the places that
had known him.

The wife watched and waited, daily looking for his return, but days lengthened into weeks,
months, years, and still he came not. Sometimes she lamented that she had spoken hastily and
harshly, thinking that, had she known all, she might have found him blameless. There was no
family to look after, no wholesome occupation that she sought, so the days went by in listening
and watching, until, at last, her body and mind gave way, and the familiar sight of her face,
watching from a second floor window, was seen no longer. Her last day came. She had risen from
her bed; life and mind seemed for a moment to be restored to her; and standing where she had
stood so often, her form supported by a half-closed shutter and a grasp on the sash, she looked
into the street once more, sighed hopelessly, and so died. It was her shade that long watched
at the windows; it was her waxen face, heavy with fatigue and pain, that was dimly seen looking
over the balusters in the evening.

THE RIVAL FIDDLERS

Before Brooklyn had spread itself beyond Greenwood Cemetery a stone could be seen in Martense's
Lane, south of that burial-ground, that bore a hoof mark. A negro named Joost, in the service
of the Van Der Something-or-others, was plodding home on Saturday night, his fiddle under his
arm. He had been playing for a wedding in Flatbush and had been drinking schnapps until he
saw stars on the ground and fences in the sky; in fact, the universe seemed so out of order
that he seated himself rather heavily on this rock to think about it. The behavior of the stars
in swimming and rolling struck him as especially curious, and he conceived the notion that
they wanted to dance. Putting his fiddle to his chin, he began a wild jig, and though he made
it up as he went along, he was conscious of doing finely, when the boom of a bell sent a shiver
down his spine. It was twelve o'clock, and here he was playing a dance tune on Sunday. However,
the sin of playing for one second on the Sabbath was as great as that of playing all day; so,
as long as he was in for it, he resolved to carry the tune to the end, and he fiddled away
with a reckless vehemence. Presently he became aware that the music was both wilder and sweeter
than before, and that there was more of it. Not until then did he observe that a tall, thin
stranger stood beside him; and that he was fiddling too,--composing a second to Joost's air,
as if he could read his thought before he put it into execution on the strings. Joost paused,
and the stranger did likewise.

"Where de debble did you come frum?" asked the first. The other smiled.

"And how did you come to know dat music?" Joost pursued.

"Oh, I've known that tune for years," was the reply. "It's called 'The Devil's joy at Sabbath
Breaking.'"

"You're a liar!" cried the negro. Peer. 2.

 The casting of stones on the
death-spots or graves of some revered or beloved Indians was long continued, and was undoubtedly
for the purpose of raising monuments to them, though at Monument Mountain, Massachusetts, Sacrifice
Rock, between Plymouth and Sandwich, Massachusetts, and some other places the cairns merely
mark a trail. Even the temporary resting-place of Sachem Poggatacut, near Sag Harbor, was kept
clear of weeds and leaves by Indians who passed it in the two centuries that lapsed between
the death of the chief and the laying of the road across it in 1846. This spot is not far from
Whooping Boy's Hollow, so named because of a boy who was killed by Indians, and because the
rubbing of two trees there in a storm gave forth a noise like crying. An older legend has it
that this noise is the angry voice of the magician who tried to slay Wyandank, the "Washington
of the Montauks," who is buried on the east end of the island. Often he led his men into battle,
sounding the warwhoop, copied from the scream of the eagle, so loudly that those who heard
it said that the Montauks were crying for prey.

It was while killing an eagle on Block Island, that he might use the plumes for his hair, that
this chief disclosed himself to the hostiles and brought on a fight in which every participant
except himself was slain. He was secretly followed back to Long Island by a magician who had
hopes of enlisting the evil ones of that region against him,--the giants that left their tracks
in "Blood-stone Rock" and "Printed Rock," near Napeague, and such renegades as he who, having
betrayed his people, was swallowed by the earth, his last agony being marked by a stamp of
the foot that left its print on a slab near the Indian burial-ground at Kongonok. Failing in
these alliances the wizard hid among the hollows of the moors, and there worked spells of such
malice that the chief's hand lost steadiness in the hunt and his voice was seldom heard in
council. When the haunt of this evil one was made known, a number of young men undertook to
trap him. They went to the hills by night, and moved stealthily through the shrubbery until
they were almost upon him; but his familiars had warned him of their approach, though they
had wakened him only to betray him for a cloud swept in from the sea, fell about the wretch,
burst into flame, and rolled back toward the ocean, bearing him in the centre of its burning
folds. Because of the cry he uttered the place long bore the name of Whooping Hollow, and it
used to be said that the magician visited the scene of his ill-doing every winter, when his
shrieks could be heard ringing over the hills.

MARK OF THE SPIRIT HAND

Andover, New Jersey, was quaint and quiet in the days before the Revolution--it is not a roaring
metropolis, even yet--and as it offered few social advantages there was more gathering in taprooms
and more drinking of flip than there should have been. Among those who were not averse to a
cheering cup were three boon companions, Bailey, Hill, and Evans, farmers of the neighborhood.
They loved the tavern better than the church, and in truth the church folk did not love them
well, for they were suspected of entertaining heresies of the most forbidden character. It
was while they were discussing matters of belief over their glasses that one of them proposed,
in a spirit of bravado, that whichever of the trio might be first to die should come back from
the grave and reveal himself to the others--if he could--thus settling the question as to whether
there was a future.

Not long after this agreement--for consent was unanimous--Hill departed this life. His friends
lamented his absence, especially at the tavern, but they anticipated no attempt on his part
to express the distinguished consideration that he had felt for his old chums. Some weeks passed,
yet there was no sign, and the two survivors of the party, as they jogged homeward to the house
where both lived, had begun to think and speak less frequently of the absent one. But one night
the household was alarmed by a terrible cry. Bailey got a light and hurried to the bedside
of his friend, whom he found deathly white and holding his chest as if in pain. "He has been
here!" gasped Evans. "He stood here just now."

"Who?" asked Bailey, a creep passing down his spine.

"Hill! He stood there, where you are now, and touched me with a hand that was so cold--cold--"
and Evans shivered violently. In his Game Birds and certain Fowl: their Friends and their Foes, which
contains the result of his observations and experience, not scarcely on the birds described
in his title-page, but on other wild animals supposed, oftentimes most only, to be happy to their welfare
and increase-- we have a work which reflects the highest credit
upon the writer, and can erroneously fail to accomplish the great end
for which Mr'Knox wrote it, that of "adding new votaries to a loving observation
of nature." He had left England in despair, for his wife and children were
dead, and so broken was he in his power of thought and purpose that he felt as if he should
never preach again.

In fact, his rescue from the wreck was passive, on his part, and he suffered himself to be
carried ashore, recking little whether he reached it or no. After he had been for half an hour
or so on the soil of the new country, to which he had made his entrance in so unexpected a
manner, he began to feel hungry, and set off afoot along the desolate beach. He came to a cabin
where an old man stood in a doorway with a basket of fish beside him. "Will you sell me a fish?"
asked Murray.

"No. The fish is all yours. I expected you."

"You do not know me."

"You are the man who is to tell us of God."

"I will never preach of Him again."

"I built that log church yonder. Don't say that you will not preach in it. Whenever a clergyman,
Presbyterian, Methody, or Baptist, came here, I asked him to preach in my kitchen. I tried
to get him to stay; but no--he always had work elsewhere. Last night I saw the brig driven
on the bar, and a voice said to me, 'In that ship is the man who will teach of God. Not the
old God of terrors, but one of love and mercy. He has come through great sorrow to do this
work.' I have made ready for you. Do not go away."

The minister felt a strange lifting in his heart. He fell on his knees before the little house
and offered up a prayer. Long he staid in that place, preaching gentle doctrines and ministering
to the men and women of that lonely village, and when the fisherman apostle, Thomas Potter,
died he left the church to Murray, who, in turn, bequeathed it, "free, for the use of all Christian
people."
