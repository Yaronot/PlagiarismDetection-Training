Cows were now driven in for me to kill two with one bullet; but as the off one jumped away
when the gun fired, the bullet passed through the near one, then through all the courts and
fences, and away no one knew where. The king was delighted, and said he must keep the rifle
to look at for the night. I now asked permission to speak with him on some important matters,
when he sent his women away and listened. I said I felt anxious about the road on which Mabruki
was travelling, to which I added that I had ordered him to tell Petherick to come here or else
to send property to the value of one thousand dollars; and I felt anxious because some of the
queen's officers felt doubtful about Waganda being able to penetrate Kidi. He said I need not
concern myself on that score; he was much more anxious for the white men to come here than
even I was, and he would not send my men into any danger; but it was highly improper for any
of his people to speak about such subjects. Then, assembling the women again, he asked me to
load Whitworth for him, when he shot the remaining cow, holding the rifle in both hands close
to his thigh. The feat, of course, brought forth great and uproarious congratulations from
his women. The day thus ended, and I was dismissed.

13th.--Mabriki and Bilal come into camp: they returned last night; but the Waganda escort,
afraid of my obtaining information of them before the king received it, kept them concealed.
They had been defeated in Usoga, two marches each of Kira, at the residence of Nagozigombi,
Mtesa's border officer, who gave them two bullocks, but advised their returning at once to
inform the king that the independent Wasoga had been fighting with his dependent Wasoga subjects
for some time, and the battle would not be over for two months or more, unless he sent an army
to their assistance.

I now sent Bombay to the king to request an interview, as I had much of importance to tell
him; but the could not be seen, as he was deep in the interior of the palace enjoying the society
of his wives. The Kamraviona, however, was found there waiting, as usual, on the mere chance
of his majesty taking it into his head to come out. He asked Bombay if it was true the woman
he gave me ran away; and when Bombay told him, he said, "Oh, he should have chained her for
two or three days, until she became accustomed to her residence; for women often take fright
and run away in that way, believing strangers to be cannibals." But Bombay replied, "She was
not good enough for Bana; he let her go off like a dog; he wants a young and beautiful Mhuma,
or none at all." "Ah, well, then, if he is so particular, he must wait a bit, for we have none
on hand. What I gave him is the sort of creature we give all our guests." A Msoga was sent
by the king to take the dead adjutant of yesterday out of the nest--for all Wasoga are expert
climbers, which is not the case with the Waganda; but the man was attacked half-way up the
tree by a swarm of bees, and driven down again.

14th.--After all the vexatious haggling for a house, I gained my object to-day by a judicious
piece of bribery which I had intended to accomplish whenever I could. I now succeeded in sending--for
I could not, under the jealous eyes in Uganda, get it done earlier--a present of fifteen pints
mixed beads, twenty blue eggs, and five copper bracelets, to the commander-in-chief, as a mark
of friendship. At the same time I hinted that I should like him to use his influence in obtaining
for me a near and respectable residence, where I hoped he, as well as all the Waganda nobility,
would call upon me; for my life in Uganda was utterly miserable, being shut up like a hermit
by myself every day. The result was, that a number of huts in a large plantain garden were
at once assigned to me, on the face of a hill, immediately overlooking and close to the main
road. It was considered the "West End." It had never before been occupied by any visitors excepting
Wahinda ambassadors; and being near, and in full view of the palace, was pleasant and advantageous,
as I could both hear the constant music, and see the throngs of people ever wending their way
to and from the royal abodes. I lost no time in moving all my property, turning out the original
occupants--in selecting the best hut for myself, giving the rest to my three officers--and
ordering my men to build barracks for themselves, in street form, from my hut to the main road.
There was one thing only left to be done; the sanitary orders of Uganda required every man
to build himself a house of parliament, such being the neat and cleanly nature of the Waganda--a
pattern to all other negro tribes.

15th.--As nobody could obtain an interview with the king yesterday, I went to the palace to-day,
and fired three shots--a signal which was at once answered from within by a double discharge
of a gun I had just lent him on his returning my rifle. In a little while, as soon as he had
time to dress, the king, walking like a lion, sallied forth, leading his white dog, and beckoned
me to follow him to the state hut, the court of which was filled with squatting men as usual,
well dressed, and keeping perfect order. He planted himself on his throne, and begged me to
sit by his side. Then took place the usual scene of a court levee, as described in Chapter
X., with the specialty, in this instance, that the son of the chief executioner--one of the
highest officers of state--was led off for execution, for some omission or informality in his
n'yanzigs, or salutes.

At this levee sundry Wakungu of rank complained that the Wanyambo plundered their houses at
night, and rough-handled their women, without any respect for their greatness, and, when caught,
said they were Bana's men. Bombay, who was present, heard the complaint, and declared these
were Suwarora's men, who made use of the proximity of my camp to cover their own transgressions.
Then Suwarora's deputation, who were also present, cringed forward, n'yanzigging like Waganda,
and denied the accusation, when the king gave all warning that he would find out the truth
by placing guards on the look-out at night.

Till this time the king had not heard one word about the defeat of the party sent for Petherick.
His kingdom might have been lost, and he would have been no wiser; when the officer who led
Mabruki came forward and told him all that had happened, stating, in addition to what I heard
before, that they took eighty men with them, and went into battle three times successfully.
Dismissing business, however, the king turned to me, and said he never saw anything so wonderful
as my shooting in his life; he was sure it was done by magic, as my gun never missed, and he
wished I would instruct him in the art. When I denied there was any art in shooting, further
than holding the gun straight, he shook his head, and getting me to load his revolving pistol
for him, he fired all five barrels into two cows before the multitude. He then thought of adjutant-shooting
with ball, left the court sitting, desired me to follow him, and leading the way, went into
the interior of the palace, where only a few select officers were permitted to follow us. The
birds were wild, and as nothing was done, I instructed him in the way to fire from his shoulder,
placing the gun in position. He was shy at first, and all the people laughed at my handling
royalty like a schoolboy; but he soon took to it very good-naturedly, when I gave him my silk
necktie and gold crest-ring, explaining their value, which he could not comprehend, and telling
him we gentlemen prided ourselves on never wearing brass or copper.

He now begged hard for shot; but I told him again his only chance of getting any lay in opening
the road onwards; it was on this account, I said, I had come to see him to-day. He answered,
"I am going to send an army to Usoga to force the way from where your men were turned back."
But this, I said, would not do for me, as I saw his people travelled like geese, not knowing
the direction of Gani, or where they were going to when sent. I proposed that if he would call
all his travelling men of experience together, I would explain matters to them by a map I had
brought; for I should never be content till I saw Petherick.

The map was then produced. He seemed to comprehend it immediately, and assembled the desired
Wakungu; but, to my mortification, he kept all the conversation to himself, Waganda fashion;
spoke a lot of nonsense; and then asked his men what they thought had better be done. The sages
replied, "Oh, make friends, and do the matter gently." But the king proudly raised his head,
laughed them to scorn, and said, "Make friends with men who have crossed their spears with
us already! Nonsense! they would only laugh at us; the Uganda spear alone shall do it." Hearing
this bravado, the Kamraviona, the pages, and the elders, all rose to a man, with their sticks,
and came charging at their king, swearing they would carry out his wished with their lives.
The meeting now broke up in the usual unsatisfactory, unfinished manner, by the king rising
and walking away, whilst I returned with the Kamraviona, who begged for ten more blue eggs
in addition to my present to make a full necklace, and told my men to call upon him in the
morning, when he would give me anything I wished to eat. Bombay was then ordered to describe
what sort of food I lived on usually; when, Mganda fashion, he broke a stick into ten bits,
each representing a differing article, and said, "Bana eat mixed food always"; and explained
that stick No. 1 represented beef; No. 2, mutton; No. 3, fowl; No. 4, eggs; No. 5, fish; No.
6, potatoes; No. 7, plantains; No. 8, pombe; No. 9, butter; No. 10, flour.

16th.--To-day the king was amusing himself among his women again, and not to be seen. I sent
Bombay with ten blue eggs as a present for the Kamraviona, intimating my desire to call upon
him. He sent me a goat and ten fowls' eggs, saying he was not visible to strangers on business
to-day. I inferred that he required the king's permission to receive me. This double failure
was a more serious affair then a mere slight; for my cows were eaten up, and my men clamouring
incessantly for food; and though they might by orders help themselves "ku n'yangania"--by seizing--from
the Waganda, it hurt my feelings so much to witness this, that I tried from the first to dispense
with it, telling the king I had always flogged my men for stealing, and now he turned them
into a pack of thieves. I urged that he should either allow me to purchase rations, or else
feed them from the palace as Rumanika did; but he always turned a deaf ear, or said that what
Sunna his father had introduced it ill became him to subvert; and unless my men helped themselves
they would die of starvation.

On the present emergency I resolved to call upon the queen. On reaching the palace, I sent
an officer in to announce my arrival, and sat waiting for the reply fully half an hour, smoking
my pipe, and listening to her in the adjoining court, where music was playing, and her voice
occasionally rent the air with merry boisterous laughing.

The messenger returned to say no one could approach her sanctuary or disturb her pleasure at
this hour; I must wait and bide my time, as the Uganda officers do. Whew! Here was another
diplomatic crisis, which had to be dealt with in the usual way. "I bide my time!" I said, rising
in a towering passion, and thrashing the air with my ramrod walking-stick, before all the visiting
Wakungu, "when the queen has assured me her door would always be open to me! I shall leave
this court at once, and I solemnly swear I shall never set foot in it again, unless some apology
be made for treating me like a dog." Then, returning home, I tied up all the presents her majesty
had given me in a bundle, and calling Maula and my men together, told them to take them where
they came from; for it ill became me to keep tokens of friendship when no friendship existed
between us. I came to make friends with the queen, not to trade or take things from her--and
so forth. The blackguard Maula, laughing, said, "Bana does not know what he is doing; it is
a heinous offence in Uganda sending presents back; nobody for their lives dare do so to the
queen; her wrath would know no bounds. She will say, 'I took a few trifles from Bana as specimens
of his country, but they shall all go back, and the things the king has received shall go back
also, for we are all of one family'; and then won't Bana be very sorry? Moreover, Wakungu will
be killed by dozens, and lamentations will reign throughout the court to propitiate the devils
who brought such disasters on them." Bombay, also in a fright, said, "Pray don't do so; you
don't know these savages as we do; there is no knowing what will happen; it may defeat our
journey altogether. Further, we have had no food these four days, because row succeeds row.
If we steal, you flog us; and if we ask the Waganda for food, they beat us. We don't know what
to do." I was imperative, however, and said, "Maula must take back these things in the morning,
or stand the consequences." In fact, I found that, like the organ-grinders in London, to get
myself moved on I must make myself troublesome.

17th.--The queen's presents were taken back by Maula and Nasib, whilst I went to see the Kamraviona.
Even this gentleman kept me waiting for some time to show his own importance, and then admitted
me into one of his interior courts, where I found him sitting on the ground with several elders;
whilst Wasoga minstrels played on their lap-harps, and sang songs in praise of their king,
and the noble stranger who wore fine clothes and eclipsed all previous visitors. At first,
on my approach, the haughty young chief, very handsome, and twenty years of age, did not raise
his head; then he begged me to be seated, and even enquired after my health, in a listless,
condescending kind of manner, as if the exertion of talking was too much for his constitution
or his rank; but he soon gave up this nonsense as I began to talk, inquired, amongst other
things, why I did not see the Waganda at my house, when I said I should so much like to make
acquaintance with them, and begged to be introduced to the company who were present.

I was now enabled to enlarge the list of topics on which it is prohibited to the Waganda to
speak or act under pain of death. No one even dare ever talk about the royal pedigree of the
countries that have been conquered, or even of any neighbouring countries; no one dare visit
the king's guests, or be visited by them, without leave, else the king, fearing sharers in
his plunder, would say, What are you plucking our goose for? Neither can any one cast his eye
for a moment on the women of the palace, whether out walking or at home, lest he should be
accused of amorous intentions. Beads and brass wire, exchanged for ivory or slaves, are the
only articles of foreign manufacture any Mganda can hold in his possession. Should anything
else be seen in his house--for instance, cloth--his property would be confiscated and his life
taken.

I was now introduced to the company present, of whom one Mgema, an elderly gentleman of great
dignity, had the honour to carry Sunna the late king; Mpungu, who cooked for Sunna, also ranks
high in court; then Usungu and Kunza, executioners, rank very high, enjoying the greatest confidence
with the king; and, finally, Jumba and Natigo, who traced their pedigree to the age of the
first Uganda king. As I took down a note of their several names, each seemed delighted at finding
his name written down by me; and Kunza, the executioner, begged as a great favour that I would
plead to the king to spare his son's life, who, as I have mentioned, was ordered out to execution
on the last levee day. At first I thought it necessary, for the sake of maintaining my dignity,
to raise objections, and said it would ill become one of my rank to make any request that might
possibly be rejected; but as the Kamraviona assured me there would be no chance of failure,
and everybody else agreed with him, I said it would give me intense satisfaction to serve him;
and the old man squeezed my hand as if overpowered with joy.

This meeting, as might be imagined, was a very dull one, because the company, being tongue-tied
as regards everything of external interest, occupied themselves solely on matters of home business,
or indulged their busy tongues, Waganda fashion, in gross flattery of their "illustrious visitor."
In imitation of the king, the Kamraviona now went from one hut to another, requesting us to
follow that we might see all his greatness, and then took me alone into a separate court, to
show me his women, some five-and-twenty of the ugliest in Uganda. This, he added, was a mark
of respect he had never conferred on any person before; but, fearing lest I should misunderstand
his meaning and covet any of them, he said, "Mind they are only to be looked at."

As we retired to the other visitors, the Kamraviona, in return for some courteous remarks of
mine, said all the Waganda were immensely pleased with my having come to visit them; and as
he heard my country is governed by a woman, what would I say if he made the Waganda dethrone
her, and create me king instead? Without specially replying, I showed him a map, marking off
the comparative sizes of British and Waganda possessions, and shut him up. The great Kamraviona,
or commander-in-chief, with all his wives, has no children, and was eager to know if my skill
could avail to remove this cloud in his fortunes. He generously gave me a goat and eggs, telling
my men they might help themselves to plantains from any gardens they liked beyond certain limits,
provided they did not enter houses or take anything else. He then said he was tired and walked
away without another word.

On returning home I found Nasib and Maula waiting for me, with all the articles that had been
returned to the queen very neatly tied together. They had seen her majesty, who, on receiving
my message, pretended excessive anger with her doorkeeper for not announcing my arrival yesterday--flogged
him severely--inspected all the things returned--folded them up again very neatly with her
own hands--said she felt much hurt at the mistake which had arisen, and hoped I would forgive
and forget it, as her doors would always be open to me.

I now had a laugh at my friends Maula and Bombay for their misgivings of yesterday, telling
them I knew more of human nature than they did; but they shook their heads, and said it was
all very well Bana having done it, but if Arabs or any other person had tried the same trick,
it would have been another affair. "Just so," said I; "but then, don't you see, I know my value
here, which makes all the difference you speak of."

18th.--Whilst walking towards the palace to pay the king a friendly visit, I met two of my
men speared on the head, and streaming with blood; they had been trying to help themselves
to plantains carried on the heads of Waganda; but the latter proving too strong, my people
seized a boy and woman from their party as witnesses, according to Uganda law, and ran away
with them, tied hand and neck together. With this addition to my attendance I first called
in at the Kamraviona's for justice; but as he was too proud to appear at once, I went on to
the king's fired three shots as usual, and obtained admittance at once, when I found him standing
in a yard dressed in cloth, with his iron chair behind him, and my double-gun loaded with half
charges of powder and a few grains of iron shot, looking eagerly about for kites to fly over.
His quick eye, however, readily detected my wounded men and prisoners, as also some Wazinza
prisoners led in by Waganda police, who had been taken in the act of entering Waganda houses
and assailing their women. We can him was, taiwanese. Who set his profligate, unrighteousness-learn.

 At the same time he asked for my paint-box,
merely to look at it. Though I repeatedly dunned him for it, I could never get it back from
him until I was preparing to leave Uganda.

27th.--After breakfast I started on a visit to Congow; but finding he had gone to the king
as usual, called at Masimbi's and he being absent also, I took advantage of my proximity to
the queen's palace to call on her majesty. For hours I was kept waiting; firstly, because she
was at breakfast; secondly, because she was "putting on medicine"; and, thirdly, because the
sun was too powerful for her complexion; when I became tired of her nonsense, and said, "If
she does not wish to see me, she had better say so at once, else I shall walk away; for the
last time I came I saw her but for a minute, when she rudely turned her back upon me, and left
me sitting by myself." I was told not to be in a hurry--she would see me in the evening. This
promise might probably be fulfilled six blessed hours from the time when it was made; but I
thought to myself, every place in Uganda is alike when there is no company at home, and so
I resolved to sit the time out, like Patience on a monument, hoping something funny might turn
up after all.

At last her majesty stumps out, squats behind my red blanket, which is converted into a permanent
screen, and says hastily, or rather testily, "Can't Bana perceive the angry state of the weather?--clouds
flying about, and the wind blowing half a gale? Whenever that is the case, I cannot venture
out." Taking her lie without an answer, I said, I had now been fifty days or so doing nothing
in Uganda--not one single visitor of my own rank ever came near me, and I could not associated
with people far below her condition and mine--in fact, all I had to amuse me at home now was
watching a hen lay her eggs upon my spare bed. Her majesty became genial, as she had been before,
and promised to provide me with suitable society. I then told her I had desired my officers
several times to ask the king how marriages were conducted in this country, as they appeared
so different from ours, but they always said they dared not put such a question to him, and
now I hoped she would explain it to me. To tell her I could not get anything from the king,
I knew would be the surest way of eliciting what I wanted from her, because of the jealousy
between the two courts; and in this instance it was fully proved, for she brightened up at
once, and, when I got her to understand something of what I meant by a marriage ceremony, in
high good humour entered on a long explanation, to the following effect:--

There are no such things as marriages in Uganda; there are no ceremonies attached to it. If
any Mkungu possessed of a pretty daughter committed an offence, he might give her to the king
as a peace-offering; if any neighbouring king had a pretty daughter, and the king of Uganda
wanted her, she might be demanded as a fitting tribute. The Wakungu in Uganda are supplied
with women by the king, according to their merits, from seizures in battle abroad, or seizures
from refractory officers at home. The women are not regarded as property according to the Wanyamuezi
practice, though many exchange their daughters; and some women, for misdemeanours, are sold
into slavery; whilst others are flogged, or are degraded to do all the menial services of the
house.

The Wakungu then changed the subject by asking, if I married a black woman, would there be
any offspring, and what would be their colour? The company now became jovial, when the queen
improved it by making a significant gesture, and with roars of laughter asking me if I would
like to be her son-in-law, for she had some beautiful daughters, either of the Wahuma, or Waganda
breed. Rather staggered at first by this awful proposal, I consulted Bombay what I should do
with one if I got her. He, looking more to number one than my convenience, said, "By all means
accept the offer, for if YOU don't like her, WE should, and it would be a good means of getting
her out of this land of death, for all black people love Zanzibar." The rest need not be told;
as a matter of course I had to appear very much gratified, and as the bowl went round, all
became uproarious. I must wait a day or two, however, that a proper selection might be made;
and when the marriage came off, I was to chain the fair one two or three days, until she became
used to me, else, from mere fright, she might run away.

To keep up the spirits of the queen, though her frequent potions of pombe had wellnigh done
enough, I admired her neck-ring, composed of copper wire, with a running inlaid twist of iron,
and asked her why she wore such a wreath of vine-leaves, as I had often seen on some of the
Wakungu. On this she produced a number of rings similar to the one she wore, and taking off
her own, placed it round my neck. Then, pointing to her wreath, she said, "This is the badge
of a kidnapper's office--whoever wears it, catches little children." I inferred that its possession,
as an insignia of royalty, conferred on the bearer the power of seizure, as the great seal
in this country confers power on public officers.

The queen's dinner was now announced; and, desiring me to remain where I was for a short time,
she went to it. She sent me several dishes (plantain-leaves), with well-cooked beef and mutton,
and a variety of vegetables, from her table, as well as a number of round moist napkins, made
in the shape of wafers, from the freshly-drawn plantain fibres, to wash the hands and face
with. There was no doubt now about her culinary accomplishments. I told her so when she returned,
and that I enjoyed her parties all the more because they ended with a dinner. "More pombe,
more pombe," cried the queen, full of mirth and glee, helping everybody round in turn, and
shouting and laughing at their Kiganda witticisms--making, though I knew not a word said, an
amusing scene to behold--till the sun sank; and her majesty remarking it, turned to her court
and said, "If I get up, will Bana also rise, and not accuse me of deserting him?" With this
speech a general rising took place, and, watching the queen's retiring, I stood with my hat
in hand, whilst all the Wakungu fell upon their knees, and then all separated.

28th.--I went to the palace, and found, as usual, a large levee waiting the king's pleasure
to appear; amongst whom were the Kamraviona, Masimbi, and the king's sister Miengo. I fired
my gun, and admitted at once, but none of the others could follow me save Miengo. The king,
sitting on the chair with his women by his side, ordered twelve cloths, the presents of former
Arab visitors, to be brought before him; and all of these I was desired to turn into European
garments, like my own coats, trousers, and waistcoats. It was no use saying I had no tailors--the
thing must be done somehow; for he admired my costume exceedingly, and wished to imitate it
now he had cloth enough for ever to dispense with the mbugu.

As I had often begged the king to induce his men, who are all wonderfully clever artisans,
to imitate the chair and other things I gave him, I now told him if he would order some of
his sempsters, who are far cleverer with the needle than my men, to my camp, I would cut up
some old clothes, and so teach them how to work. This was agreed to, and five cows were offered
as a reward; but as his men never came, mine had to do the job.

Maula then engaged the king's attention for fully an hour, relating what wonderful things Bana
kept in his house, if his majesty would only deign to see them; and for this humbug got rewarded
by a present of three women. Just at this juncture an adjutant flew overhead, and, by way of
fun, I presented my gun, when the excited king, like a boy from school, jumped up, forgetting
his company, and cried, "Come, Bana, and shoot the nundo; I know where he has gone--follow
me." And away we went, first through one court, then through another, till we found the nundo
perched on a tree, looking like a sedate old gentleman with a bald head, and very sharp, long
nose. Politeness lost the bird; for whilst I wished the king to shoot, he wished me to do so,
from fear of missing it himself. He did not care about vultures--he could practise at them
at any time; but he wanted a nundo above all things. The bird, however, took the hint, and
flew away.

29th.--According to appointment I went early this morning to visit Congow. He kept me some
time waiting in his outer hut, and then called me in to where I found him sitting with his
women--a large group, by no means pretty. His huts are numerous, the gardens and courts all
very neat and well kept. He was much delighted with my coming, produced pombe, and asked me
what I thought of his women, stripping them to the waist. He assured me that he had thus paid
me such a compliment as nobody else had ever obtained, since the Waganda are very jealous of
one another--so much so, that any one would be killed if found starring upon a woman even in
the highways. Just then I heard that Mkuenda, the queen's woman-keeper, was outside waiting
for me, but dared not come in, because Congow's women were all out; so I asked leave to go
home to breakfast, much to the surprise of Congow, who thought I was his guest for the whole
day. It is considered very indecorous in Uganda to call upon two persons in one day, though
even the king or the queen should be one of them. Then, as there was no help for it--Congow
could not detain me when hungry--he showed me a little boy, the only child he had, and said,
with much fatherly pride, "Both the king and queen have called on me to see this fine little
fellow"; and we parted to meet again some other day. Outside his gate I found Mkuenda, who
said the queen had sent him to invite "her son" to bring her some stomach medicine in the morning,
and come to have a chat with her. With Mkuenda I walked home; but he was so awed by the splendour
of my hut, with its few blankets and bit of chintz, that he would not even sit upon a cow-skin,
but asked if any Waganda dared venture in there. He was either too dazzled or too timid to
answer any questions, and in a few minutes walked away again.

After this, I had scarcely swallowed by breakfast before I received a summons from the king
to meet him out shooting, with all the Wanguana armed, and my guns; and going towards the palace,
found him with a large staff, pages and officers as well as women, in a plantain garden, looking
eagerly out for birds, whilst his band was playing. In addition to his English dress, he wore
a turban, and pretended that the glare of the sun was distressing his eyes--for, in fact, he
wanted me to give him a wideawake like my own. Then, as if a sudden freak had seized him, though
I knew it was on account of Maula's having excited his curiosity, he said, "Where does Bana
live? lead away." Bounding and scrambling, the Wakungu, the women and all, went pell-mell through
everything towards my hut. If the Kamraviona or any of the boys could not move fast enough,
on account of the crops on the fields, they were piked in the back till half knocked over;
but, instead of minding, they trotted on, n'yanzigging as if honoured by a kingly poke, though
treated like so many dogs.

Arrived at the hut, the king took off his turban as I took off my hat, and seated himself on
my stool; whilst the Kamraviona, with much difficulty, was induced to sit upon a cowskin, and
the women at first were ordered to squat outside. Everything that struck the eye was much admired
and begged for, though nothing so much as my wideawake and mosquito-curtains; then, as the
women were allowed to have a peep in and see Bana in his den, I gave them two sacks of beads,
to make the visit profitable, the only alternative left me from being forced into inhospitality,
for no one would drink from my cup. Moreover, a present was demanded by the laws of the country.

The king, excitedly impatient, now led the way again, shooting hurry-scurry through my men's
lines, which were much commented on as being different from Waganda hutting, on to the tall
tree with the adjutant's nest. One young bird was still living in it. There was no shot, so
bullets must be fired; and the cunning king, wishing to show off, desired me to fire simultaneously
with himself. We fired, but my bullet struck the bough the nest was resting on; we fired again,
and the bullet passed through the nest without touching the bird. I then asked the king to
allow me to try his Whitworth, to which a little bit of stick, as a charm to secure a correct
aim, had been tied below the trigger-guard. This time I broke the bird's leg, and knocked him
half out of the nest; so, running up to the king, I pointed to the charm, saying, That has
done it--hoping to laugh him out of the folly; but he took my joke in earnest, and he turned
to his men, commenting on the potency of the charm. Whilst thus engaged, I took another rifle
and brought the bird down altogether. "Woh, woh, woh!" shouted the king; "Bana, Mzungu, Mzungu!"
he repeated, leaping and clapping his hands, as he ran full speed to the prostrate bird, whilst
the drums beat, and the Wakungu followed him: "Now, is not this a wonder? but we must go and
shoot another." "Where?" I said; "we may walk a long way without finding, if we have nothing
but our eyes to see with. Just send for your telescope, and then I will show you how to look
for birds." Surprised at this announcement, the king sent his pages flying for the instrument,
and when it came I instructed him how to use it; when he could see with it, and understand
its powers, his astonishment knew no bounds; and, turning to his Wakungu, he said, laughing,
"Now I do see the use of this thing I have been shutting up in the palace. On that distant
tree I can see three vultures. To its right there is a hut, with a woman sitting inside the
portal, and many goats are feeding all about the palace, just as large and distinct as if I
was close by them."

The day was now far spent, and all proceeded towards the palace. On the way a mistletoe was
pointed out as a rain-producing tree, probably because, on a former occasion, I had advised
the king to grow groves of coffee-trees about his palace to improve its appearance, and supply
the court with wholesome food--at the same time informing him that trees increase the falls
of rain in a country, though very high ones would be dangerous, because they attract lightning.
Next the guns must be fired off; and, as it would be a pity to waste lead, the king, amidst
thunders of applause, shot five cows, presenting his gun from the shoulder.

So ended the day's work in the field, but not at home; for I had hardly arrived there before
the pages hurried in to beg for powder and shot, then caps, then cloth, and, everything else
failing, a load of beads. Such are the persecutions of this negro land--the host every day
must beg something in the most shameless manner from his guest, on the mere chance of gaining
something gratis, though I generally gave the king some trifle when he least expected it, and
made an excuse that he must wait for the arrival of fresh stores from Gani when he asked.

30th.--To fulfil my engagement with the queen, I walked off to her palace with stomach medicine,
thinking we were now such warm friends, all pride and distant ceremonies would be dispensed
with; but, on the contrary, I was kept waiting for hours till I sent in word to say, if she
did not want medicine, I wished to go home, for I was tired of Uganda and everything belonging
to it. I had now to make my selection, and took the smaller one, promising her to Bombay as
soon as we arrived on the coast, where, he said, she would be considered a Hubshi or Abyssinian.
But when the queen saw what I had done, she gave me the other as well, saying the little one
was too young to go alone, and, if separated, she would take fright and run away. Then with
a gracious bow I walked of with my two fine specimens of natural history, though I would rather
have had princes, that I might have taken them home to be instructed in England; but the queen,
as soon as we had cleared the palace, sent word to say she must have another parting look at
her son with his wives. Still laughing, she said, "That will do; you look beautiful; now go
away home"; and off we trotted, the elder sobbing bitterly, the younger laughing.

As soon as we reached home, my first inquiry was concerning their histories, of which they
appeared to know but very little. The elder, whom I named Meri (plantains), was obtained by
Sunna, the late king, as a wife, from Nkole; and though she was a mere Kahala, or girl, when
the old king died, he was so attached to her he gave her twenty cows, in order that she might
fatten up on milk after her native fashion; but on Sunna's death, when the establishment of
women was divided, Meri fell to N'yamasore's (the queen's) lot. The lesser one, who still retains
the name of Kahala, said she was seized in Unyoro by the Waganda, who took her to N'yamasore,
but what became of her father and mother she could not say.

It was now dinner-time, and as the usual sweet potatoes and goat's flesh were put upon my box-table,
I asked them to dine with me, and we became great friends, for they were assured they would
finally get good houses and gardens at Zanzibar; but nothing would induce either of them to
touch food that had been cooked with butter. A dish of plantains and goat-flesh was then prepared;
but though Kahala wished to eat it, Meri rejected the goat's flesh, and would not allow Kahala
to taste it either; and thus began a series of domestic difficulties. On inquiring how I could
best deal with my difficult charge, I was told the Wahuma pride was so great, and their tempers
so strong, they were more difficult to break in than a phunda, or donkey, though when once
tamed, they became the best of wives.

31st.--I wished to call upon the queen and thank her for her charming present, but my hungry
men drove me to the king's palace in search of food. The gun firing brought Mtesa out, prepared
for a shooting trip, with his Wakungu leading, the pages carrying his rifle and ammunition,
and a train of women behind. The first thing seen outside the palace gate was a herd of cows,
from which four were selected and shot at fifty paces by the king, firing from his shoulder,
amidst thunders of applause and hand-shakings of the elders. I never saw them dare touch the
king's hand before. Then Mtesa, turning kindly to me, said, "Pray take a shot"; but I waived
the offer off, saying he could kill better himself. Ambitious of a cut above cows, the king
tried his hand at some herons perched on a tree, and, after five or six attempts, hit one in
the eye. Hardly able to believe in his own skill, he stood petrified at first, and then ran
madly to the fallen bird, crying, "Woh, woh, woh! can this be?--is it true? Woh, woh!" He jumped
in the air, and all his men and women shouted in concert with him. Then he rushes at me, takes
both my hands--shakes, shakes--woh, woh!--then runs to his women, then to his men; shakes them
all, woh-wohing, but yet not shaking or wohing half enough for his satisfaction, for he is
mad with joy at his own exploit.

The bird is then sent immediately to his mother, whilst he retires to his palace, woh-wohing,
and taking "ten to the dozen" all the way and boasting of his prowess. "Now, Bana, tell me--do
you not think, if two such shots as you and I were opposed to an elephant, would he have any
chance before us? I know I can shoot--I am certain of it now. You have often asked me to go
hippopotamus-shooting with you, but I staved it off until I learnt the way to shoot. Now, however,
I can shoot--and that remarkably well too, I flatter myself. I will have at them, and both
of us will go on the lake together." The palace was now reached; musicians were ordered to
play before the king, and Wakungu appointments were made to celebrate the feats of the day.
Then the royal cutler brought in dinner-knives made of iron, inlaid with squares of copper
and brass, and goats and vegetables were presented as usual, when by torchlight we were dismissed,
my men taking with them as many plantains as they could carry.

1st.--I stayed at home all this day, because the king and queen had set it apart for looking
at and arranging their horns--mapembe, or fetishes, as the learned call such things--to see
that there are no imperfections in the Uganga. This was something like an inquiry into the
ecclesiastical condition of the country, while, at the same time, it was a religious ceremony,
and, as such, was appropriate to the first day after the new moon appears. This being the third
moon by account, in pursuance of ancient customs, all the people about court, including the
king, shaved their heads--the king, however, retaining his cockscomb, the pages their double
cockades, and the other officers their single cockades on the back of the head, or either side,
according to the official rank of each. My men were occupied making trousers for the king all
day; whilst the pages, and those sent to learn the art of tailoring, instead of doing their
duty, kept continually begging for something to present the king.

2d.--The queen now taking a sporting fit into her head, sent for me early in the morning, with
all my men, armed, to shoot a crested crane in her palace; but though we were there as required,
we were kept waiting till late in the afternoon, when, instead of talking about shooting, as
her Wakungu had forbidden her doing it, she asked after her two daughters--whether they had
run away, or if they liked their new abode? I replied I was sorry circumstances did not permit
my coming to thank her sooner, for I felt grateful beyond measure to her for having charmed
my house with such beautiful society. I did not follow her advice to chain either of them with
iron, for I found cords of love, the only instrument white men know the use of, quite strong
enough. Fascinated with this speech, she said she would give me another of a middle age between
the two, expecting, as I thought, that she would thus induce me to visit her more frequently
than I did her son; but, though I thanked her, it frightened me from visiting her for ages after.

She then said, with glowing pride, casting a sneer on the king's hospitality, "In the days
of yore, Sunna, whenever visitors came to see him, immediately presented them with women, and,
secondly, with food; for he was very particular in looking after his guests' welfare, which
is not exactly what you find the case now, I presume." The rest of the business of the day
consisted in applications for medicine and medical treatment, which it was difficult satisfactorily
to meet.

3d.--To-day Katumba, the king's head page, was sent to me with deoles to be made into trousers
and waistcoats, and a large sixty-dollar silk I had given him to cover the chair with. The
king likes rich colours, and I was solemnly informed that he will never wear anything but clothes
like Bana.

4th.--By invitation I went to the palace at noon, with guns, and found the king holding a levee,
the first since the new moon, with all heads shaved in the manner I have mentioned. Soon rising,
he showed the way through the palace to a pond, which is described as his bathing N'yanza,
his women attending, and pages leading the way with his guns. From this we passed on to a jungle
lying between the palace hill and another situated at the northern end of the lake, where wild
buffaloes frequently lie concealed in the huge papyrus rushes of a miry drain; but as none
could be seen at that moment, we returned again to the palace. He showed me large mounds of
earth, in the shape of cocked hats, which are private observatories, from which the surrounding
country can be seen. By the side of these observatories are huts, smaller than the ordinary
ones used for residing in, where the king, after the exertion of "looking out," takes his repose.
Here he ordered fruit to be brought--the Matunguru, a crimson pod filled with acid seeds, which
has only been observed growing by the rivers or waters of Uganda--and Kasori, a sort of liquorice-root.
He then commenced eating with us, and begging again, unsuccessfully, for my compass. I tried
again to make him see the absurdity of tying a charm on Whitworth's rifle, but without the
least effect. In fact he mistook all my answers for admiration, and asked me, in the simplest
manner possible, if I would like to possess a charm; and even when I said "No, I should be
afraid of provoking Lubari's" (God's) "anger if I did so," he only wondered at my obstinacy,
so thoroughly was he wedded to his belief. He then called for his wideawake, and walked with
us into another quarter of his palace, when he entered a dressing-hut, followed by a number
of full-grown, stark-naked women, his valets; at the same time ordering a large body of women
to sit on one side the entrance, whilst I, with Bombay, were directed to sit on the other,
waiting till he was ready to hold another levee. From this, we repaired to the great throne-hut,
where all his Wakungu at once formed court, and business was commenced. Amongst other things,
an officer, by name Mbogo, or the Buffalo, who had been sent on a wild-goose chase to look
after Mr Petherick, described a journey he had made, following down the morning sun. After
he had passed the limits of plantain-eating men, he came upon men who lived upon meat alone,
who never wore mbugus, but either cloth or skins, and instead of the spear they used the double-edged
sime. He called the people Wasewe, and their chief Kisawa; but the company pronounced them
to be Masawa (Masai).

After this, about eighty men were marched into the court, with their faces blackened, and strips
of plantain-bark tied on their heads, each holding up a stick in his hand in place of a spear,
under the regulation that no person is permitted to carry weapons of any sort in the palace.
They were led by an officer, who, standing like a captain before his company, ordered them
to jump and praise the king, acting the part of fugleman himself. Then said the king, turning
to me, "Did I not tell you I had sent many men to fight? These are some of my army returned;
the rest are coming, and will eventually, when all are collected, go in a body to fight in
Usoga." Goats and other peace-offerings were then presented; and, finally a large body of officers
came in with an old man, with his two ears shorn off for having been too handsome in his youth,
and a young woman who, after four days' search, had been discovered in his house. They were
brought for judgment before the king.

Nothing was listened to but the plaintiff's statement, who said he had lost the woman four
days, and, after considerable search, had found her concealed by the old man, who was indeed
old enough to be her grandfather.

The king, in total unconcern about the tragedy he had thus enacted, immediately on their departure
said, "Now, then, for shooting, Bana; let us look at your gun." It happened to be loaded, but
fortunately only with powder, to fire my announcement at the palace; for he instantly placed
caps on the nipples, and let off one barrel by accident, the contents of which stuck in the
thatch. This created a momentary alarm, for it was supposed the thatch had taken fire; but
it was no sooner suppressed than the childish king, still sitting on his throne, to astonish
his officers still more, levelled the gun from his shoulder, fired the contents of the second
barrel into the faces of his squatting Wakungu, and then laughed at his own trick. In the meanwhile
cows were driven in, which the king ordered his Wakungu to shoot with carbines; and as they
missed them, he showed them the way to shoot with the Whitworth, never missing. The company
now broke up, but I still clung to the king, begging him to allow me to purchase food with
beads, as I wanted it, for my establishment was always more or less in a starving state; but
he only said, "Let us know what you want and you shall always have it"; which, in Uganda, I
knew from experience only meant, Don't bother me any more, but give me your spare money, and
help yourself from my spacious gardens--Uganda is before you.

5th--To-day the king went on a visit with his mother, and therefore neither of them could be
seen by visitors. I took a stroll towards the N'yanza, passing through the plantain-groves
occupied by the king's women, where my man Sangoro had been twice taken up by the Mgemma and
put in the stocks. The plantain gardens were beautifully kept by numerous women, who all ran
away from fright at seeing me, save one who, taken by surprise, threw herself flat on the ground,
rolled herself up in her mbugu, and, kicking with her naked heels, roared murder and help,
until I poked her up, and reproached her for her folly. This little incident made my fairies
bolder, and, sidling up to me one by one, they sat in a knot with me upon the ground; then
clasping their heads with their hands, they woh-wohed in admiration of the white man; they
never in all their lives saw anything so wonderful; his wife and children must be like him;
what would not Sunna have given for such a treat?--but it was destined to Mtesa's lot. What
is the interpretation of this sign, if it does not point to the favour in which Mtesa is upheld
by the spirits? I wished to go, but no: "Stop a little more," they said, all in a breath, or
rather out of breath in their excitement; "remove the hat and show the hair; take off the shoes
and tuck up the trousers; what on earth is kept in the pockets? Oh, wonder of wonders!--and
the iron!" As I put the watch close to the ear of one of them, "Tick, tick, ticks--woh, woh,
woh"--everybody must hear it; and then the works had to be seen. "Oh, fearful!" said one, "hide
your faces: it is the Lubari. Shut it up, Bana, shut it up; we have seen enough; but you will
come again and bring us beads." So ended the day's work.

6th.--To-day I sent Bombay to the palace for food. Though rain fell in torrents, he found the
king holding a levee, giving appointments, plantations, and women, according to merit, to his
officers. As one officer, to whom only one woman was given, asked for more, the king called
him an ingrate, and ordered him to be cut to pieces on the spot; and the sentence was, as Bombay
told me, carried into effect--not with knives, for they are prohibited, but with strips of
sharp-edged grass, after the executioners had first dislocated his neck by a blow delivered
behind the head, with a sharp, heavy-headed club.

No food, however, was given to my men, though the king, anticipating Bombay's coming, sent
me one load of tobacco, one of butter, and one of coffee. My residence in Uganda became much
more merry now, for all the women of the camp came daily to call on my two little girls; during
which time they smoked my tobacco, chewed my coffee, drank my pombe, and used to amuse me with
queer stories of their native land. Rozaro's sister also came, and proposed to marry me, for
Maula, she said, was a brutal man; he killed one of his women because he did not like her,
and now he had clipped one of this poor creature's ears off for trying to run away from him;
and when abused for his brutality, he only replied, "It was no fault of his, as the king set
the example in the country."

In the evening I took a walk with Kahala, dressed in a red scarf, and in company with Lugoi,
to show my children off in the gardens to my fair friends of yesterday. Everybody was surprised.
The Mgemma begged us to sit with him and drink pombe, which he generously supplied to our heart's
content; wondered at the beauty of Kahala, wished I would give him a wife like her, and lamented
that the king would not allow his to wear such pretty clothes. We passed on a little farther,
and were invited to sit with another man, Lukanikka, to drink pombe and chew coffee--which
we did as before, meeting with the same remarks; for all Waganda, instructed by the court,
know the art of flattery better than any people in the world, even including the French.

7th.--In the morning, whilst it rained hard, the king sent to say that he had started buffalo-shooting,
and expected me to join him. After walking a mile beyond the palace, we found him in a plantain
garden, dressed in imitation of myself, wideawake and all, the perfect picture of a snob. He
sent me a pot of pombe, which I sent home to the women, and walked off for the shooting-ground,
two miles further on, the band playing in the front, followed by some hundred Wakungu--then
the pages, then the king, next myself, and finally the women--the best in front, the worst
bringing up the rear, with the king's spears and shield, as also pots of pombe, a luxury the
king never moves without. It was easy to see there would be no sport, still more useless of
offer any remarks, therefore all did as they were bid. The broad road, like all in Uganda,
went straight over hill and dale, the heights covered with high grass or plantain groves, and
the valleys with dense masses of magnificent forest-trees surrounding swamps covered with tall
rushes half bridged. Proceeding on, as we came to the first water, I commenced flirtations
with Mtesa's women, much to the surprise of the king and every one. This favour the king did
for me, and I in return for the women behind; they had never been favoured in their lives with
such gallantry, and therefore could not refrain from laughing, which attracted the king's notice
and set everybody in a giggle; for till now no mortal man had ever dared communicate with his
women.

Shortly after this we left the highway, and, turning westwards, passed through a dense jungle
towards the eastern shores of the Murchison Creek, cut by runnels and rivulets, where on one
occasion I offered, by dumb signs to carry the fair ones pick-a-back over, and after crossing
a second myself by a floating log, offered my hand. The leading wife first fears to take it,
then grows bold and accepts it; when the prime beauty, Lubuga, following in her wake, and anxious
to feel, I fancy, what the white man is like, with an imploring face holds out both her hands
in such a captivating manner, that though I feared to draw attention by waiting any longer,
I could not resist compliance.

We were now on the buffalo ground; but nothing could be seen save some old footprints of buffaloes,
and a pitfall made for catching them. By this time the king was tired; and as he saw me searching
for a log to sit upon, he made one of his pages kneel upon all fours and sat upon his back,
acting the monkey in aping myself; for otherwise he would have sat on a mbugu, in his customary
manner, spread on the ground. We returned, pushing along, up one way, then another, without
a word, in thorough confusion, for the king delights in boyish tricks, which he has learned
to play successfully. Leaving the road and plunging into thickets of tall grass, the band and
Wakungu must run for their lives, to maintain the order of march, by heading him at some distant
point of exit from the jungle; whilst the Kamraviona, leading the pages and my men, must push
head first, like a herd of buffaloes, through the sharp-cutting grass, at a sufficient rate
to prevent the royal walk from being impeded; and the poor women, ready to sink with exhaustion,
can only be kept in their places by fear of losing their lives.

We had been out the whole day; still he did not tire of these tricks, and played them incessantly
till near sundown, when we entered the palace. Then the women and Wakungu separating from us,
we--that is, the king, the Kamraviona, pages, and myself--sat down to a warm feast of sweet
potatoes and plantains, ending with pombe and fruit, whilst moist circular napkins, made in
the shape of magnificent wafers out of plantain fibre, acted at once both the part of water
and towel. This over, as the guns had to be emptied, and it was thought sinful to waste the
bullets, four cows were ordered in and shot by the king. Thus ended the day, my men receiving
one of the cows.

8th.--As Mtesa was tired with his yesterday's work, and would not see anybody, I took Lugoi
and Kahala, with a bundle of beads, to give a return to the Mgemma for his late treat of pombe.
His household men and women were immensely delighted with us, but more so, they said, for the
honour of the visit. They gave us more pombe, and introduced us to one of N'yamasore's numerous
sisters, who was equally charmed with myself and my children. The Mgemma did not know how he
could treat us properly, he said, for he was only a poor man; but he would order some fowls,
that I might carry them away. When I refused this offer, because we came to see him, and not
to rob him, he thought it the most beautiful language, and said he would bring them to the
house himself. I added, I hoped he would do so in company with his wife, which he promised,
though he never dared fulfil the promise; and, on our leaving, set all his servants to escort
us beyond the premises. In the evening, as the king's musicians passed the camp, I ordered
them in to play the milele, and give my men and children a treat of dancing. The performers
received a bundle of beads and went away happy.

9th.--I called on Congow, but found him absent, waiting on the king, as usual; and the king
sent for my big rifle to shoot birds with.

10th.--In consequence of my having explained to the king the effect of the process of distilling,
and the way of doing it, he sent a number of earthen pots and bugus of pombe that I might produce
some spirits for him; but as the pots sent were not made after the proper fashion, I called
at the palace and waited all day in the hope of seeing him. No one, however, dared enter his
cabinet, where he had been practising "Uganga" all day, and so the pombe turned sour and useless.
Such are the ways of Uganda all over.

11th.--The king was out shooting; and as nothing else could be done, I invited Uledi's pretty
wife Guriku to eat a mutton breakfast, and teach my child Meri not to be so proud. In this
we were successful; but whether her head had been turned, as Bombay thought, or what else,
we know not; but she would neither walk, nor talk, nor do anything but lie at full length all
day long, smoking and lounging in thorough indolence.

12th.--I distilled some fresh pombe for the king; and taking it to him in the afternoon, fired
guns to announce arrival. He was not visible, while fearful shrieks were heard from within,
and presently a beautiful woman, one of the king's sisters, with cockscomb erect, was dragged
out to execution, bewailing and calling on her king, the Kamraviona, and Mzungu, by turns,
to save her life. Would to God I could have done it! but I did not know her crime, if crime
she had committed, and therefore had to hold my tongue, whilst the Kamraviona, and other Wakungu
present, looked on with utter unconcern, not daring to make the slightest remark. It happened
that Irungu was present in the ante-chamber at this time; and as Maula came with my party,
they had a fight in respect to their merits for having brought welcome guests to their king.
Mtesa, it was argued, had given N'yamgundu more women and men than he did to Maula, because
he was the first to bring intelligence of our coming, as well as that of K'yengo, and Suworora's
hongo to his king; whilst, finally, he superseded Maula by taking me out of his charge, and
had done a further good service by sending men on to Karague to fetch both Grant and K'yengo.

Maula, although he had received the second reward, had literally done nothing, whilst Irungu
had been years absent at Usui, and finally had brought a valuable hongo, yet he got less than
Maula. This, Irungu said, was an injustice he would not stand; N'yamgundu fairly earned his
reward, but Maula must have been tricking to get more than himself. He would get a suitable
offering of wire, and lay his complaint in court the first opportunity. "Pooh, pooh! nonsense!"
says Maula, laughing; "I will give him more wires than you, and then let us see who will win
the king's ear." Upon this the two great children began collecting wire and quarrelling until
the sun went down, and I went home. I did not return to a quiet dinner, as I had hoped, but
to meet the summons of the king. Thinking it policy to obey, I found him waiting my coming
in the palace. He made apologies for not answering my gun, and tasted some spirits resembling
toddy, which I had succeeded in distilling. He imbibed it with great surprise; it was wonderful
tipple; he must have some more; and, for the purpose of brewing better, would send the barrel
of an old Brown Bess musket, as well as more pombe and wood in the morning.

13th.--As nothing was done all day, I took the usual promenade in the Seraglio Park, and was
accosted by a very pretty little woman, Kariana, wife of Dumba, who, very neatly dressed, was
returning from a visit. At first she came trotting after me, then timidly paused, then advanced,
and, as I approached, stood spellbound at my remarkable appearance. At last recovering herself,
she woh-wohed with all the coquetry of a Mganda woman, and a flirtation followed; she must
see my hair, my watch, the contents of my pockets--everything; but that was not enough. I waved
adieu, but still she followed. I offered my arm, showing her how to take it in European fashion,
and we walked along to the surprise of everybody, as if we had been in Hyde Park rather than
in Central Africa, flirting and coquetting all the way. I was surprised that no one came to
prevent her forwardness; but not till I almost reached home did any one appear; and then, with
great scolding, she was ordered to return--not, however, without her begging I would call in
and see her on some future occasion, when she would like to give me some pombe.

14th.--As conflicting reports came about Grant, the king very courteously, at my request, forwarded
letters to him. I passed the day in distilling pombe, and the evening in calling on Mrs Dumba,
with Meri, Kahala, Lugoi, and a troop of Wanyamuezi women. She was very agreeable; but as her
husband was attending the palace, could not give pombe, and instead gave my female escort sundry
baskets of plaintains and potatoes, signifying a dinner, and walked half-way home, flirting
with me as before.

15th--I called on the king with all the spirits I had made, as well as the saccharine residue.
We found him holding a levee, and receiving his offerings of a batch of girls, cows, goats,
and other things of an ordinary nature. One of the goats presented gave me an opportunity of
hearing one of the strangest stories I had yet heard in this strange country: it was a fine
for attempted regicide, which happened yesterday, when a boy, finding the king alone, which
is very unusual, walked up to him and threatened to kill him, because, he said, he took the
lives of men unjustly. The king explained by description and pantomime how the affair passed.
When the youth attacked him he had in his hand the revolving pistol I had given him, and showed
us, holding the pistol to his cheek, how he had presented the muzzle to the boy, which, though
it was unloaded, so frightened him that he ran away. All the courtiers n'yanzigged vigorously
for the condescension of the king in telling the story. There must have been some special reason
why, in a court where trifling breaches of etiquette were punished with a cruel death, so grave
a crime should have been so leniently dealt with; but I could not get at the bottom of the
affair. The culprit, a good-looking young fellow of sixteen or seventeen, who brought in the
goat, made his n'yanzigs, stroked the goat and his own face with his hands, n'yanzigged again
with prostrations, and retired.

After this scene, officers announced the startling fact that two white men had been seen at
Kamrasi's, one with a beard like myself, the other smooth-faced. I jumped at this news, and
said, "Of course, they are there; do let me send a letter to them." I believed it to be Petherick
and a companion whom I knew he was to bring with him. The king, however, damped my ardour by
saying the information was not perfect, and we must wait until certain Wakungu, whom he sent
to search in Unyoro, returned.

16th.--The regions about the palace were all in a state of commotion to-day, men and women
running for their lives in all directions, followed by Wakungu and their retainers. The cause
of all this commotion was a royal order to seize sundry refractory Wakungu, with their property,
wives, concubines--if such a distinction can be made in this country--and families all together.
At the palace Mtesa had a musical party, playing the flute occasionally himself. After this
he called me aside, and said, "Now, Bana, I wish you would instruct me, as you have often proposed
doing, for I wish to learn everything, though I have little opportunity for doing so." Not
knowing what was uppermost in his mind, I begged him to put whatever questions he liked, and
he should be answered seriatim--hoping to find him inquisitive on foreign matters; but nothing
was more foreign to his mind: none of his countrymen ever seemed to think beyond the sphere
of Uganda.

The whole conversation turned on medicines, or the cause and effects of diseases. Cholera,
for instance, very much affected the land at certain seasons, creating much mortality, and
vanishing again as mysteriously as it came. What brought this scourge? and what would cure
it? Supposing a man had a headache, what should he take for it? or a leg ache, or a stomach-ache,
or itch; in fact, going the rounds of every disease he knew, until, exhausting the ordinary
complaints, he went into particulars in which he was personally much interested; but I was
unfortunately unable to prescribe medicines which produce the physical phenomenon next to his
heart.

17th.--I called upon the king by appointment, and found a large court, where the Wakungu caught
yesterday, and sentenced to execution, received their reprieve on paying fines of cattle and
young damsels--their daughters. A variety of charms, amongst which were some bits of stick
strung on leather and covered with serpent-skin, were presented and approved of. Kaggao, a
large district officer, considered the second in rank here, received permission for me to call
upon him with my medicines. I pressed the king again to send men with mine to Kamrasi's to
call Petherick. At first he objected that they would be killed, but finally he yielded, and
appointed Budja, his Unyoro ambassador, for the service. Then, breaking up the court, he retired
with a select party of Wakungu, headed by the Kamraviona, and opened a conversation on the
subject which is ever uppermost with the king and his courtiers.

18th.--To-day I visited Kaggao with my medicine-chest. He had a local disease, which he said
came to him by magic, though a different cause was sufficiently obvious, and wanted medicine
such as I gave Mkuenda, who reported that I gave him a most wonderful draught. Unfortunately
I had nothing suitable to give my new patient, but cautioned him to have a care lest contagion
should run throughout his immense establishment, and explained the whole of the circumstances
to him. Still he was not satisfied; he would give me slaves, cows, or ivory, if I would only
cure him. He was a very great man, as I could see, with numerous houses, numerous wives, and
plenty of everything, so that it was ill-becoming of him to be without his usual habits. Rejecting
his munificent offers, I gave him a cooling dose of calomel and jalap, which he drank like
pombe, and pronounced beautiful--holding up his hands, and repeating the words "Beautiful,
beautiful! they are all beautiful together! There is Bana beautiful! his box is beautiful!
and his medicine beautiful!"--and, saying this, led us in to see his women, who at my request
were grouped in war apparel--viz., a dirk fastened to the waist by many strings of coloured
beads. There were from fifty to sixty women present, all very lady-like, but none of them pretty.
Kaggao then informed me the king had told all his Wakungu he would keep me as his guest four
months longer to see if Petherick came; and should he not by that time, he would give me an
estate, stocked with men, women, and cattle, in perpetuity, so that, if I ever wished to leave
Uganda, I should always have something to come back to; so I might now know what my fate was
to be. Before leaving, Kaggao presented us with two cows and ten baskets of potatoes.

19th.--I sent a return present of two wires and twelve fundo of beads of sorts to Kaggao, and
heard that the king had gone to show himself off to his mother dressed Bana fashion. In the
evening Katunzi, N'yamasore's brother, just returned from the Unyoro plunder, called on me
whilst I was at dinner. Not knowing who he was, and surprised at such audacity in Uganda, for
he was the first officer who ever ventured to come near me in this manner, I offered him a
knife and fork, and a share in the repast, which rather abashed him; for, taking it as a rebuff,
he apologised immediately for the liberty he had taken, contrary to the etiquette of Uganda
society, in coming to a house when the master was at dinner; and he would have left again had
I not pressed him to remain. Katunzi then told me the whole army had returned from Unyoro,
with immense numbers of cows, women, and children, but not men, for those who did not run away
were killed fighting. He offered me a present of a woman, and pressed me to call on him.

20th.--Still I found that the king would not send his Wakungu for the Unyoro expedition, so
I called on him about it. Fortunately he asked me to speak a sentence in English, that he might
hear how it sounds; and this gave me an opportunity of saying, if he had kept his promise by
sending Budja to me, I should have despatched letters to Petherick. This was no sooner interpreted
than he said, if I would send my men to him with letters in the morning he would forward them
on, accompanied with an army. On my asking if the army was intended to fight, he replied, in
short, "First to feel the way." On hearing this, I strongly advised him, if he wished the road
to be kept permanently open, to try conciliation with Kamrasi, and send him some trifling present.

Now were brought in some thirty-odd women for punishment and execution, which the king, who
of late had been trying to learn Kisuahili, in order that we might be able to converse together,
asked me, in that language, if I would like to have some of these women; and if so, how many?
On my replying "One," he begged me to have my choice, and a very pretty one was selected. God
only knows what became of the rest; but the one I selected, on reaching home, I gave to Ilmas,
my valet, for a wife. He and all the other household servants were much delighted with this
charming acquisition; but the poor girl, from the time she had been selected, had flattered
herself she was to be Bana's wife, and became immensely indignant at the supposed transfer,
though from the first I had intended her for Ilmas, not only to favour him for his past good
services, but as an example to my other men, as I had promised to give them all, provided they
behaved well upon the journey, a "free-man's garden," with one wife each and a purse of money,
to begin a new life upon, as soon as they reached Zanzibar. The temper of Meri and Kahala was
shown in a very forcible manner: they wanted this maid as an addition to my family, called
her into the hut and chatted till midnight, instructing her not to wed with Ilmas; and then,
instead of turning into bed as usual, they all three slept upon the ground. My patience could
stand this phase of henpecking no longer, so I called in Manamaka, the head Myamuezi woman,
whom I had selected for their governess, and directed her to assist Ilmas, and put them to
bed "bundling."

21st.--In the morning, before I had time to write letters, the king invited me to join him
at some new tank he was making between his palace and the residence of his brothers. I found
him sitting with his brothers, all playing in concert on flutes. I asked him, in Kisuahili,
if he knew where Grant was? On replying in the negative, I proposed sending a letter, which
he approved of; and Budja was again ordered to go with an army for Petherick.

22d.--Mabruki and Bilal, with Budja, started to meet Petherick, and three more men, with another
letter to Grant. I called on the king, who appointed the 24th instant for an excursion of three
days' hippopotamus-shooting on the N'yanza.

23d.--To-day occurred a brilliant instance of the capricious restlessness and self-willedness
of this despotic king. At noon, pages hurried in to say that he had started for the N'yanza,
and wished me to follow him without delay. N'yanza, as I have mentioned, merely means a piece
of water, whether a pond, river, or lake; and as no one knew which N'yanza he meant, or what
project was on foot, I started off in a hurry, leaving everything behind, and walked rapidly
through gardens, over hills, and across rushy swamps, down the west flank of the Murchison
Creek, till 3 p.m., when I found the king dressed in red, with his Wakungu in front and women
behind, travelling along in the confused manner of a pack of hounds, occasionally firing his
rifle that I might know his whereabouts. He had just, it seems, mingled a little business with
pleasure; for noticing, as he passed, a woman tied by the hands to be punished for some offence,
the nature of which I did not learn, he took the executioner's duty on himself, fired at her,
and killed her outright.

On this occasion, to test all his followers, and prove their readiness to serve him, he had
started on a sudden freak for the three days' excursion on the lake one day before the appointed
time, expecting everybody to fall into place by magic, without the smallest regard to each
one's property, feelings, or comfort. The home must be forsaken without a last adieu, the dinner
untasted, and no provision made for the coming night, in order that his impetuous majesty should
not suffer one moment's disappointment. The result was natural; many who would have come were
nowhere to be found; my guns, bed, bedding, and note-books, as well as cooking utensils, were
all left behind, and, though sent for, did not arrive till the following day.

On arriving at the mooring station, not one boat was to be found, nor did any arrive until
after dark, when, on the beating of drums and firing of guns, some fifty large ones appeared.
They were all painted with red clay, and averaged from ten to thirty paddles, with long prows
standing out like the neck of a syphon or swan, decorated on the head with the horns of the
Nsunnu (lencotis) antelope, between which was stuck upright a tuft of feathers exactly like
a grenadier's plume. These arrived to convey us across the mouth of a deep rushy swamp to the
royal yachting establishment, the Cowes of Uganda, distant five hours' travelling from the
palace. We reached the Cowes by torchlight at 9 p.m., when the king had a picnic dinner with
me, turned in with his women in great comfort, and sent me off to a dreary hut, where I had
to sleep upon a grass-strew floor. I was surprised we had to walk so far, when, by appearance,
we might have boated it from the head of the creek all the way down; but, on inquiry, was informed
of the swampy nature of the ground at the head of the creek precluded any approach to the clear
water there, and hence the long overland journey, which, though fatiguing to the unfortunate
women, who had to trot the whole way behind Mtesa's four-mile-an-hour strides, was very amusing.
The whole of the scenery--hill, dale, and lake--was extremely beautiful. The Wanguana in my
escort compared the view to their own beautiful Poani (coast); but in my opinion it far surpassed
anything I ever saw, either from the sea or upon the coast of Zanzibar.

The king rose betimes in the morning and called me, unwashed and very uncomfortable, to picnic
with him, during the collection of the boats. The breakfast, eaten in the open court, consisted
of sundry baskets of roast-beef and plantain-squash, folded in plantain-leaves. He sometimes
ate with a copper knife and picker, not forked--but more usually like a dog, with both hands.
The bits too tough for his mastication he would take from his mouth and give as a treat to
the pages, who n'yanzigged, and swallowed them with much seeming relish. Whatever remained
over was then divided by the boys, and the baskets taken to the cooks. Pombe served as tea,
coffee, and beer for the king; but his guests might think themselves very lucky if they ever
got a drop of it.

Now for the lake. Everybody in a hurry falls into his place the best way he can--Wakungu leading,
and women behind. They rattle along, through plantains and shrubs, under large trees, seven,
eight, and nine feet in diameter, till the beautiful waters are reached--a picture of the Rio
scenery, barring that of the higher mountains in the background of that lovely place, which
are here represented by the most beautiful little hills. A band of fifteen drums of all sizes,
called the Mazaguzo, playing with the regularity of a lot of factory engines at work, announced
the king's arrival, and brought all the boats to the shore--but not as in England, where Jack,
with all the consequence of a lord at home, invites the ladies to be seated, and enjoys the
sight of so many pretty faces. Here every poor fellow, with his apprehensions written in his
face, leaps over the gunwale into the water--ducking his head for fear of being accused of
gazing on the fair sex, which is death--and bides patiently his time. They were dressed in
plantain leaves, looking like grotesque Neptunes. The king, in his red coat and wideawake,
conducted the arrangements, ordering all to their proper places--the women, in certain boats,
the Wakungu and Wanguana in others, whilst I sat in the same boat with him at his feet, three
women holding mbugus of pombe behind. The king's Kisuahali now came into play, and he was prompt
in carrying out the directions he got from myself to approach the hippopotami. But the waters
were too large and the animals too shy, so we toiled all the day without any effect, going
only once ashore to picnic; not for the women to eat--for they, poor things, got nothing--but
the king, myself, the pages, and the principal Wakungu. As a wind-up to the day's amusement,
the king led the band of drums, changed the men according to their powers, put them into concert
pitch, and readily detected every slight irregularity, showing himself a thorough musician.

This day requires no remark, everything done being the counterpart of yesterday, excepting
that the king, growing bolder with me in consequence of our talking together, became more playful
and familiar--amusing himself, for instance, sometimes by catching hold of my beard as the
rolling of the boat unsteadied him.

We started early in the usual manner; but after working up and down the creek, inspecting the
inlets for hippopotami, and tiring from want of sport, the king changed his tactics, and, paddling
and steering himself with a pair of new white paddles, finally directing the boats to an island
occupied by the Mgussa, or Neptune of the N'yanza, not in person--for Mgussa is a spirit--but
by his familiar or deputy, the great medium who communicates the secrets of the deep to the
king of Uganda. In another sense, he might be said to be the presiding priest of the source
of the mighty Nile, and as such was, of course, an interesting person for me to meet. The first
operation on shore was picnicking, when many large bugus of pombe were brought for the king;
next, the whole party took a walk, winking through the trees, and picking fruit, enjoying themselves
amazingly, till, by some unlucky chance, one of the royal wives, a most charming creature,
and truly one of the best of the lot, plucked a fruit and offered it to the king, thinking,
doubtless, to please him greatly; but he, like a madman, flew into a towering passion, said
it was the first time a woman ever had the impudence to offer him anything, and ordered the
pages to seize, bind, and lead her off to execution.

These words were no sooner uttered by the king than the whole bevy of pages slipped their cord
turbans from their heads, and rushed, like a pack of cupid beagles upon the fairy queen, who,
indignant at the little urchins daring to touch her majesty, remonstrated with the king, and
tried to beat them off like flies, but was soon captured, overcome, and dragged away, crying,
in the names of the Kamraviona and Mzungu (myself), for help and protection; whilst Lubuga,
the pet sister, and all the other women, clasped the king by his legs, and, kneeling, implored
forgiveness for their sister. The more they craved for mercy, the more brutal he became, till
at last he took a heavy stick and began to belabour the poor victim on the head.

Hitherto I had been extremely careful not to interfere with any of the king's acts of arbitrary
cruelty, knowing that such interference, at an early stage, would produce more harm than good.
This last act of barbarism, however, was too much for my English blood to stand; and as I heard
my name, Mzungu, imploringly pronounced, I rushed at the king, and, staying his uplifted arm,
demanded from him the woman's life. Of course I ran imminent risk of losing my own in thus
thwarting the capricious tyrant; but his caprice proved the friend of both. The novelty of
interference even made him smile, and the woman was instantly released.

Proceeding on through the trees of this beautiful island, we next turned into the hut of the
Mgussa's familiar, which at the farther end was decorated with many mystic symbols amongst
others a paddle, the badge of his high office--and for some time we sat chatting, when pombe
was brought, and the spiritual medium arrived. He was dressed Wichwezi fashion, with a little
white goat-skin apron, adorned with numerous charms, and used a paddle for a mace or walking
stick. He was not an old man, though he affected to be so--walking very slowly and deliberately,
coughing asthmatically, glimmering with his eyes, and mumbling like a witch. With much affected
difficulty he sat at the end of the hut beside the symbols alluded to, and continued his coughing
full half an hour, when his wife came in in the same manner, without saying a word, and assumed
the same affected style.

At this juncture the Mgussa's familiar motioned the Kamraviona and several officers to draw
around him, when, in a very low tone, he gave them all the orders of the deep, and walked away.
His revelations seemed unpropitious, for we immediately repaired to our boats and returned
to our quarters. Here we no sooner arrived than a host of Wakungu, lately returned from the
Unyoro war, came to pay their respects to the king: they had returned six days or more, but
etiquette had forbidden their approaching majesty sooner. Their successes had been great, their
losses, nil, for not one man had lost his life fighting. To these men the king narrated all
the adventures of the day; dwelling more particularly on my defending his wife's life, whom
he had destined for execution. This was highly approved of by all; and they unanimously said
Bana knew what he was about, because he dispenses justice like a king in his own country.

Early in the morning a great hue and cry was made because the Wanguana had been seen bathing
in the N'yanza naked, without the slightest regard to decency. We went boating as usual all
day long, sometimes after hippopotami, at others racing up and down the lake, the king and
Wakungu paddling and steering by turns, the only break to this fatigue being when we went ashore
to picnic, or the king took a turn at the drums. During the evening some of the principal Wakungu
were collected to listen to an intellectual discourse on the peculiarities of the different
women in the royal establishment, and the king in good-honour described the benefits he had
derived from this pleasant tour on the water.

Whilst I was preparing my Massey's log to show the use of it to the king, he went off boating
without me; and as the few remaining boats would not take me off because they had received
no orders to do so, I fired guns, but, getting no reply, went into the country hoping to find
game; but, disappointed in that also, I spent the first half of the day with a hospitable old
lady, who treated us to the last drop of pombe in her house--for the king's servants had robbed
her of nearly everything--smoked her pipe with me, and chatted incessantly on the honour paid
her by the white king's visit, as well as of the horrors of Uganda punishment, when my servants
told her I saved the life of one queen. Returning homewards, the afternoon was spent at a hospitable
officer's, who would not allow us to depart until my men were all fuddled with pombe, and the
evening setting in warned us to wend our way. On arrival at camp, the king, quite shocked with
himself for having deserted me, asked me if I did not hear his guns fire. He had sent twenty
officers to scour the country, looking for me everywhere. He had been on the lake the whole
day himself, and was now amusing his officers with a little archery practice, even using the
bow himself, and making them shoot by turns. A lucky shot brought forth immense applause, all
jumping and n'yanzigging with delight, whether it was done by their own bows or the king's.

A shield was the mark, stuck up at only thirty paces; still they were such bad shots that they
hardly ever hit it. Now tired of this slow sport, and to show his superior prowess, the king
ordered sixteen shields to be placed before him, one in front of the other, and with one shot
from Whitworth pierced the whole of them, the bullet passing through the bosses of nearly every
one. "Ah!" says the king, strutting about with gigantic strides, and brandishing the rifle
over his head before all his men, "what is the use of spears and bows? I shall never fight
with anything but guns in the future." These Wakungu, having only just then returned from plundering
Unyoro, had never before seen their king in a chair, or anybody sitting, as I was, by his side;
and it being foreign to their notions, as well as, perhaps, unpleasant to their feelings, to
find a stranger sitting higher than themselves, they complained against this outrage to custom,
and induced the king to order my dethronement. The result was, as my iron stool was objectionable,
I stood for a moment to see that I thoroughly understood their meaning; and then showing them
my back, walked straightway home to make a grass throne, and dodge them that way.

There was nothing for dinner last night, nothing again this morning, yet no one would go in
to report this fact, as rain was falling, and the king was shut up with his women. Presently
the thought struck me that the rifle, which was always infallible in gaining me admittance
at the palace, might be of the same service now. I therefore shot a dove close to the royal
abode, and, as I expected, roused the king at once, who sent his pages to know what the firing
was about. When told the truth--that I had been trying to shoot a dish of doves for breakfast,
as I could get neither meat nor drink from his kitchen--the head boy, rather guessing than
understanding what was told him, distorted my message, and said to the king, as I could not
obtain a regular supply of food from his house, I did not wish to accept anything further at
his hands, but intended foraging for the future in the jungles. The king, as might be imagined,
did not believe the boy's story, and sent other pages to ascertain the truth of the case, bidding
them listen well, and beware of what they were about. This second lot of boys conveyed the
story rightly, when the king sent me a cow. As I afterwards heard, he cut off the ears of the
unfortunate little mischief-maker for not making a proper use of those organs; and then, as
the lad was the son of one of his own officers he was sent home to have the sores healed. After
breakfast the king called me to go boating, when I used my grass throne, to the annoyance of
the attendants. This induced the king to say before them, laughing, "Bana, you see, is not
to be done; he is accustomed to sit before kings, and sit he will." Then by way of a change,
he ordered all the drums to embark and play upon the waters; whilst he and his attendants paddled
and steered by turns, first up the creek, and then down nearly to the broad waters of the lake.

There was a passage this way, it was said, leading up to Usoga, but very circuitous, on account
of reefs or shoals, and on the way the Kitiri island was passed; but no other Kitiri was known
to the Waganda, though boats went sometimes coasting down the western side of the lake to Ukerewe.
The largest island on the lake is the Sese, [20] off the mouth of the Katonga river, where
another of the high priests of the Neptune of the N'yanza resides. The king's largest vessels
are kept there, and it is famous for its supply of mbugu barks. We next went on shore to picnic,
when a young hippopotamus, speared by harpoon, one pig, and a pongo or bush-boc, were presented
to the king. I now advised boat-racing, which was duly ordered, and afforded much amusement
as the whole fifty boats formed in line, and paddle furiously to the beat of drum to the goal
which I indicated.

The day was done. In great glee the king, ever much attached to the blackguard Maula, in consequence
of his amusing stories, appointed him to the office of seizer, or chief kidnapper of Wakungu;
observing that, after the return of so many officers from war, much business in that line would
naturally have to be done, and there was none so trustworthy now at court to carry out the
king's orders. All now went to the camp; but what was my astonishment on reaching the hut to
find every servant gone, along with the pots, pans, meat, everything; and all in consequence
of the king's having taken the drums on board, which, being unusual, was regarded as one of
his delusive tricks, and a sign of immediate departure. He had told no one he was going to
the N'yanza, and now it was thought he would return in the same way. I fired for my supper,
but fired in vain. Boys came out, by the king's order to inquire what I wanted, but left again
without doing anything further.

At my request the king sent off boats to inquire after the one that left, or was supposed to
have left, for Grant on the 3d of March, and he then ordered the return home, much to my delight;
for, beautiful as the N'yanza was, the want of consideration for other people's comfort, the
tiring, incessant boating, all day long and every day, in the sun, as well as the king's hurry-scurry
about everything he undertook to do, without the smallest forethought, preparation, or warning,
made me dream of my children, and look forward with pleasure to rejoining them. Strange as
it may appear to Englishmen, I had a sort of paternal love for those little blackamoors as
if they had been my offspring; and I enjoyed the simple stories that their sable visitors told
me every day they came over to smoke their pipes, which they did with the utmost familiarity,
helping themselves from my stores just as they liked.

Without any breakfast, we returned by the same route by which we had come, at four miles an
hour, till half the way was cleared, when the king said, laughing, "Bana, are you hungry?"--a
ridiculous question after twenty-four hours of starvation, which he knew full well--and led
the way into a plantain-grove, where the first hut that was found was turned inside out for
the king's accommodation, and picnic was prepared. As, however, he ordered my portion to be
given outside with the pages', and allowed neither pombe or water, I gave him the slip, and
walked hurriedly home, where I found Kahala smirking, and apparently glad to see us, but Meri
shamming ill in bed, whilst Manamaka, the governess, was full of smiles and conversation. She
declared Meri had neither tasted food or slept since my departure, but had been retching all
the time. Dreadfully concerned at the doleful story I immediately thought of giving relief
with medicines, but neither pulse, tongue, nor anything else indicated the slightest disorder;
and to add to these troubles, Ilmas's woman had tried during my absence to hang herself, because
she would not serve as servant but wished to be my wife; and Bombay's wife, after taking a
doze of quinine, was delivered of a still-born child.

1st.--I visited the king, at his request, with the medicine-chest. He had caught a cold. He
showed me several of his women grievously affected with boils, and expected me to cure them
at once. I then went home, and found twenty men who had passed Grant, coming on a stretcher
from Karague, without any of the rear property. Meri, still persistent, rejected strengthening
medicines, but said, in a confidential manner, if I would give her a goat to sacrifice to the
Uganga she would recover in no time. There was something in her manner when she said this that
I did not like--it looked suspicious; and I contented myself by saying, "No, I am a wiser doctor
than any in these lands; if anybody could cure you, that person is myself: and further, if
I gave you a goat to sacrifice, God would be angry with both of us for our superstitious credulity;
you must therefore say no more about it."

2d.--The whole country around the palace was in a state of commotion to-day, from Maula and
his children hunting down those officers who had returned from the war, yet had not paid their
respects to the king at the N'yanza, because they thought they would not be justified in calling
on him so quickly after their arrival. Maula's house, in consequence of this, was full of beef
and pombe; whilst, in his courtyard, men, women, and children, with feet in stocks, very like
the old parish stocks in England, waited his pleasure, to see what demands he would make upon
them as the price of their release. After anxiously watching, I found out that Meri was angry
with me for not allowing Ilmas's woman to live in my house; and, to conquer my resolution against
it--although I ordered it with a view to please Ilmas, for he was desperately in love with
her--she made herself sick by putting her finger down her throat. I scolded her for her obstinacy.
She said she was ill--it was not feigned; and if I would give her a goat to sacrifice she would
be well at once; for she had looked into the magic horn already, and discovered that if I have
her a goat for that purpose it would prove that I loved her, and her health would be restored
to her at once. Hallo! Here was a transformation from the paternal position into that of a
henpecked husband! Somebody, I smelt at once, had been tampering with my household whilst I
was away. I commenced investigations, and after a while found out that Rozaro's sister had
brought a magician belonging to her family into the hut during my absence, who had put Meri
up to this trick of extorting a goat from me, in order that he might benefit by it himself,
for the magician eats the sacrifice, and keeps the skin.

I immediately ordered him to be seized and bound to the flag-staff, whilst Maula, Uledi, Rozaro,
and Bombay were summoned to witness the process of investigation. Rozaro flew into a passion,
and tried to release the magician as soon as he saw him, affecting intense indignation that
I should take the law into my own hands when one of Rumanika's subjects was accused; but only
lost his dignity still more on being told he had acknowledged his inability to control his
men so often when they had misbehaved, that I scorned to ask his assistance any longer. He
took huff at this, and, as he could not help himself, walked away, leaving us to do as we liked.
The charge was fully proved. The impudent magician, without leave, and contrary to all the
usages of the country, had entered and set my house against itself during my absence, and had
schemed to rob me of a goat. I therefore sentenced him to fifty lashes--twenty-five for the
injury he had inflicted on my by working up a rebellion in my house, and the remaining twenty-five
for attempting larceny--saying, as he had wanted my goat and its skin, so now in return I wanted
his skin. These words were no sooner pronounced than the wretched Meri cried out against it,
saying all the fault was hers: "Let the stick skin my back, but spare my doctor; it would kill
me to see him touched."

This appeal let me see that there was something in the whole matter too deep and intricate
to be remedied by my skill. I therefore dismissed her on the spot, and gave her, as a sister
and free woman, to Uledi and his pretty Mhmula wife, giving Bombay orders to carry the sentences
into execution. After walking about till after dark, on returning to the empty house, I had
some misgivings as to the apparent cruelty of abandoning one so helpless to the uncertainties
of this wicked world. Ilmas's woman also ran away, doubtless at the instigation of Rozaro's
sister, for she had been denied any further access to the house as being at the bottom of all
this mischief.

3d.--I was haunted all night by my fancied cruelty, and in the morning sent its victim, after
Uganda fashion, some symbolical presents, including a goat, in token of esteem; a black blanket,
as a sign of mourning; a bundle of gundu anklets; and a packet of tobacco, in proof of my forgiveness.

Chapter XIV. Palace, Uganda--Continued

Reception of a Victorious Army at Court--Royal Sport--A Review of the Troops--Negotiations
for the Opening of the Road along the Nile--Grant's Return--Pillagings--Court Marriages--The
King's Brothers--Divinations and Sacrifices--The Road granted at last--The Preparations for
continuing the Expedition--The Departure.

I now received a letter from Grant to say he was coming by boat from Kitangule, and at once
went to the palace to give the welcome news to the king. The road to the palace I found thronged
with people; and in the square outside the entrance there squatted a multitude of attendants,
headed by the king, sitting on a cloth, dressed in his national costume, with two spears and
a shield by his side. On his right hand the pages sat waiting for orders, while on his left
there was a small squatting cluster of women, headed by Wichwezis, or attendant sorceresses,
offering pombe. In front of the king, in form of a hollow square, many ranks deep, sat the
victorious officers, lately returned from the war, variously dressed; the nobles distinguished
by their leopard-cat skins and dirks, the commoners by coloured mbugu and cow or antelope skin
cloaks; but all their faces and arms were painted red, black, or smoke-colour. Within the square
of men, immediately fronting the king, the war-arms of Uganda were arranged in three ranks;
the great war-drum, covered with a leopard-skin, and standing on a large carpeting of them,
was placed in advance; behind this, propped or hung on a rack of iron, were a variety of the
implements of war in common use, offensive and defensive, as spears--of which two were of copper,
the rest iron--and shields of wood and leather; whilst in the last row or lot were arranged
systematically, with great taste and powerful effect, the supernatural arms, the god of Uganda,
consisting of charms of various descriptions and in great numbers. Outside the square again,
in a line with the king, were the household arms, a very handsome copper kettledrum, of French
manufacture, surmounted on the outer edge with pretty little brass bells depending from swan-neck-shaped
copper wire, two new spears, a painted leather shield, and magic wands of various devices,
deposited on a carpet of leopard-skins--the whole scene giving the effect of true barbarous
royalty in its uttermost magnificence.

Approaching, as usual, to take my seat beside the king, some slight sensation was perceptible,
and I was directed to sit beyond the women. The whole ceremonies of this grand assemblage were
now obvious. Each regimental commandant in turn narrated the whole services of his party, distinguishing
those subs who executed his orders well and successfully from those who either deserted before
the enemy or feared to follow up their success. The king listened attentively, making, let
us suppose, very shrewd remarks concerning them; when to the worthy he awarded pombe, helped
with gourd-cups from large earthen jars, which has n'yanzigged for vehemently; and to the unworthy
execution. When the fatal sentence was pronounced, a terrible bustle ensued, the convict wrestling
and defying, whilst the other men seized, pulled and tore the struggling wretch from the crowd,
bound him hands and head together, and led or rather tumbled him away.

After a while, and when all business was over, the king begged me to follow him into the palace.
He asked again for stimulants--a matter ever uppermost in his mind--and would not be convinced
that such things can do him no possible good, but would in the end be deleterious. Grant's
letter was then read to him before his women, and I asked for the dismissal of all the Wanyambo,
for they had not only destroyed my peace and home, but were always getting me into disrepute
by plundering the Waganda in the highways. No answer was given to this; and on walking home,
I found one of the king's women at my hut, imploring protection against the Wanyambo, who had
robbed and bruised her so often, she could not stand such abuse any longer.

4th.--I sent Maula, early in the morning, with the plundered woman, and desired him to request
that the Wanyambo might be dismissed. He returned, saying he delivered my message, but no reply
was given. I then searched for the king, and found him at his brothers' suite of huts playing
the flute before them. On taking my seat, he proudly pointed to two vultures which he had shot
with bullet, saying to his brothers, "There, do you see these birds? Bana shoots with shot,
but I kill with bullets." To try him, I then asked for leave to go to Usoga, as Grant was so
far off; but he said, "No, wait until he comes, and you shall both go together then; you fancy
he is far off, but I know better. One of my men saw him coming along carried on a stretcher."
I said, "No; that must be a mistake, for he told me by letter he would come by water."

Heavy rain now set in, and we got under cover; but the brothers never moved, some even sitting
in the streaming gutter, and n'yanzigging whenever noticed. The eldest brother offered me his
cup of pombe, thinking I would not drink it; but when he saw its contents vanishing fast, he
cried "lekerow!" (hold fast!) and as I pretended not to understand him, continuing to drink,
he rudely snatched the cup from my lips. Alternate concerts with the brothers, and conversation
about hunting, in consequence of a bump caused by a fall with steeple-chasing, which as discovered
on my forehead, ended this day's entertainment.

5th.--As all the Wanguana went foraging, I was compelled to stop at home. The king, however,
sent an officer for Grant, because I would not believe in his statement yesterday that he was
coming by land; and I also sent a lot of men with a litter to help him on, and bring me an answer.

6th.--I went to the palace at the king's command. He kept us waiting an hour, and then passing
out by a side gate, beckoned us to follow. He was dressed in European clothes, with his guns
and tin box of clothes leading the way. His first question was, "Well, Bana, where are your
guns? for I have called you to go shooting." "The pages never said anything about shooting,
and therefore the guns were left behind." Totally unconcerned, the king walked on to his brothers,
headed by a band and attendants, who were much lauded for being ready at a moment's notice.
A grand flute concert was then played, one of the younger brothers keeping time with a long
hand-drum; then the band played; and dancing and duets and singing followed. After the usual
presentations, fines, and n'yanziggings, I asked for leave to go and meet Grant by water, but
was hastily told that two boats had been sent for him when we returned from the N'yanza, and
that two runners, just returned from Karague, said he was on the way not far off. The child-king
then changed his dress for another suit of clothes for his brothers to admire, and I retired,
much annoyed, as he would neither give pombe for myself, nor plantains for my men: and I was
further annoyed on my arrival at home, to find the Wanguana mobbing my hut and clamouring for
food, and calling for an order to plunder if I did not give them beads, which, as the stock
had run short, I could only do by their returning to Karague for the beads stored there; and,
even if they were obtained, it was questionable if the king would revoke his order prohibiting
the sale of provisions to us.

7th.--To-day I called at the queen's, but had to wait five hours in company with some attendants,
to whom she sent pombe occasionally; but after waiting for her nearly all day, they were dismissed,
because excess of business prevented her seeing them, though I was desired to remain. I asked
these attendants to sell me food for beads, but they declared they could not without obtaining
permission. In the evening the queen stumped out of her chambers and walked to the other end
of her palace, where the head or queen of the Wichwezi women lived, to whom everybody paid
the profoundest respect. On the way I joined her, she saying, in a state of high anger, "You
won't call on me, now I have given you such a charming damsel: you have quite forgotten us
in your love of home." Of course Meri's misdemeanour had to be explained, when she said, "As
that is the case, I will give you another; but you must take Meri out of the country, else
she will bring trouble on us; for, you know, I never gave girls who lived in the palace to
any one in my life before, because they would tell domestic affairs not proper for common people
to know." I then said my reason for not seeing her before was, that the four times I had sent
messengers to make an appointment for the following day, they had been repulsed from her doors.
This she would not believe, but called me a story-teller in very coarse language, until the
men who had been sent were pointed out to her, and they corroborated me.

The Wichwezi queen met her majesty with her head held very high, and instead of permitting
me to sit on my box of grass, threw out a bundle of grass for that purpose. All conversation
was kept between the two queens; but her Wichwezi majesty had a platter of clay-stone brought,
which she ate with great relish, making a noise of satisfaction like a happy guinea-pig. She
threw me a bit, which to the surprise of everybody, I caught and threw it into my mouth, thinking
it was some confection; but the harsh taste soon made me spit it out again, to the amusement
of the company. On returning home I found the king had requested me to call on him as soon
as possible with the medicine-chest.

8th.--Without a morsel to eat for dinner last night, or anything this morning, we proceeded
early to the palace, in great expectation that the medicines in request would bring us something;
but after waiting all day till 4 p.m., as the king did not appear, leaving Bombay behind, I
walked away to shoot a guinea-fowl within earshot of the palace. The scheme was successful,
for the report of the gun which killed the bird reached the king's ear, and induced him to
say that if Bana was present he would be glad to see him. This gave Bombay an opportunity of
telling all the facts of the case; which were no sooner heard than the king gave his starving
guests a number of plantains, and vanished at once, taking my page Lugoi with him, to instruct
him in Kisuahili (Zanzibar language).

9th.--As the fruit of last night's scheme, the king sent us four goats and two cows. In great
good-humour I now called on him, and found him walking about the palace environs with a carbine,
looking eagerly for sport, whilst his pages dragged about five half-dead vultures tied in a
bundle by their legs to a string. "These birds," said he, tossing his head proudly, "were all
shot flying, with iron slugs, as the boys will tell you. I like the carbine very well, but
you must give me a double smooth gun." This I promised to give when Grant arrived, for his
good-nature in sending so many officers to fetch him.

We next tried for guinea-fowl, as I tell him they are the game the English delight in; but
the day was far spent, and none could be found. A boy then in attendance was pointed out, as
having seen Grant in Uddu ten days ago. If the statement were true, he must have crossed the
Katonga. But though told with great apparent circumspection, I did not credit it, because my
men sent on the 15th ultimo for a letter to ascertain his whereabouts had not returned, and
they certainly would have done so had he been so near. To make sure, the king then proposed
sending the boy again with some of my men; but this I objected to as useless, considering the
boy had spoken falsely. Hearing this, the king looked at the boy and then at the women in turn,
to ascertain what they thought of my opinion, whereupon the boy cried. Late in the evening
the sly little girl Kahala changed her cloth wrapper for a mbugu, and slipped quietly away.
I did not suspect her intention, because of late she had appeared much more than ordinary happy,
behaving to me in every respect like a dutiful child to a parent. A search was made, and guns
fired, in the hopes of frightening her back again, but without effect.

10th.--I had promised that this morning I would teach the king the art of guinea-fowl shooting,
and when I reached the palace at 6 a.m., I found him already on the ground. He listened to
the tale of the missing girl, and sent orders for her apprehension at once; then proceeding
with the gun, fired eight shots successively at guinea-birds sitting on trees, but missed them
all. After this, as the birds were scared away, and both iron shot and bullets were expended,
he took us to his dressing-hut, went inside himself, attended by full-grown naked women, and
ordered a breakfast of pork, beef, fish, and plantains to be served me outside on the left
of the entrance; whilst a large batch of his women sat on the right side, silently coquetting,
and amusing themselves by mimicking the white man eating. Poor little Lugoi joined in the repast,
and said he longed to return to my hut, for he was half starved here, and no one took any notice
of him; but he was destined to be a royal page, for the king would not part with him. A cold
fit then seized me, and as I asked for leave to go, the king gave orders for one of his wives
to be flogged. The reason for this act of brutality I did not discover; but the moment the
order was issued, the victim begged the pages to do it quickly, that the king's wrath might
be appeased; and in an instant I saw a dozen boys tear their cord-turbans from their heads
pull her roughly into the middle of the court, and belabour her with sticks, whilst she lay
floundering about, screeching to me for protection. All I did was to turn my head away and
walk rapidly out of sight, thinking it better not to interfere again with the discipline of
the palace; indeed, I thought it not improbable that the king did these things sometimes merely
that his guests might see his savage power. On reaching home I found Kahala standing like a
culprit before my door. She would not admit, what I suspected, that Meri had induced her to
run away; but said she was very happy in my house until yester-evening, when Rozaro's sister
told her she was very stupid living with the Mzungu all alone, and told her to run away; which
she did, taking the direction of N'yamasore's, until some officers finding her, and noticing
beads on her neck, and her hair cut, according to the common court fashion, in slopes from
a point in the forehead to the breadth of her ears, suspected her to be one of the king's women,
and kept her in confinement all night, till Mtesa's men came this morning and brought her back
again. As a punishment, I ordered her to live with Bombay; but my house was so dull again from
want of some one to eat dinner with me, that I remitted the punishment, to her great delight.

11th.--To-day I received letters from Grant, dated 22d., 25th, 28th April and 2d May. They
were brought by my three men, with Karague pease, flour, and ammunition. He was at Maula's
house, which proved the king's boy to be correct; for the convoy, afraid of encountering the
voyage on the lake, had deceived my companion and brought him on by land, like true negroes.

12th.--I sent the three men who had returned from Grant to lay a complaint against the convoy,
who had tricked him out of a pleasant voyage, and myself out of the long-wished-for survey
of the lake. They carried at the same time a present of a canister of shot from me to the king.
Delighted with this unexpected prize, he immediately shot fifteen birds flying, and ordered
the men to acquaint me with his prowess.

13th.--To-day the king sent me four cows and a load of butter as a return-present for the shot,
and allowed one of his officers, at my solicitation, to go with ten of my men to help Grant
on. He also sent a message that he had just shot thirteen birds flying.

14th.--Mabuki and Bilal returned with Budja and his ten children from Unyoro, attended by a
deputation of four men sent by Kamrasi, who were headed by Kidgwiga. Mtesa, it now transpired,
had followed my advice of making friendship with Kamrasi by sending two brass wires as a hongo
instead of an army, and Kamrasi in return, sent him two elephant-tusks. Kidgwiga said Petherick's
party was not in Unyoro--they had never reached there, but were lying at anchor off Gani. Two
white men only had been seen--one, they said, a hairy man, the other smooth-faced; they were
as anxiously inquiring after us as we were after them: they sat on chairs, dressed like myself,
and had guns and everything precisely like those in my hut. On one occasion they sent up a
necklace of beads to Kamrasi, and he, in return, gave them a number of women and tusks. If
I wished to go that way, Kamrasi would forward me on to their position in boats; for the land
route, leading through Kidi, was a jungle of ten days, tenanted by a savage set of people,
who hunt everybody, and seize everything they see.

This tract is sometimes, however, traversed by the Wanyoro and Gani people, who are traders
in cows and tippet monkey-skins, stealthily travelling at night; but they seldom attempt it
from fear of being murdered. Baraka and Uledi, sent from Karague on the 30th January, had been
at Kamrasi's palace upwards of a month, applying for the road to Gani, and as they could not
get that, wished to come with Mabruki to me; but this Kamrasi also refused, on the plea that,
as they had come from Karague, so they must return there. Kamrasi had heard of my shooting
with Mtesa, as also of the attempt made by Mabruki and Uledi to reach Gani via Usoga. He had
received my present of beads from Baraka, and, in addition, took Uledi's sword, saying, "If
you do not wish to part with it, you must remain a prisoner in my country all your life, for
you have not paid your footing." Mabruki then told me he was kept waiting at a village, one
hour's walk from Kamrasi's palace, five days before they were allowed to approach his majesty;
but when they were seen, and the presents exchanged, they were ordered to pack off the following
morning, as Kamrasi said the Waganda were a set of plundering blackguards.

This information, to say the least of it, was very embarrassing--a mixture of good and bad.
Petherick, I now felt certain, was on the look-out for us; but his men had reached Kamrasi's,
and returned again before Baraka's arrival. Baraka was not allowed to go on to him and acquaint
him of our proximity, and the Waganda were so much disliked in Unyoro, that there seemed no
hopes of our ever being able to communicate by letter. To add to my embarrassments, Grant had
not been able to survey the lake from Kitangule, nor had Usoga and the eastern side of the
lake been seen.

15th.--I was still laid up with the cold fit of the 10th, which turned into a low kind of fever.
I sent Bombay to the king to tell him the news, and ask him what he thought of doing next.
He replied that he would push for Gani direct; and sent back a pot of pombe for the sick man.

16th.--The king to-day inquired after my health, and, strange to say, did not accompany his
message with a begging request.

17th.--My respite, however, was not long. At the earliest possible hour in the morning the
king sent begging for things one hundred times refused, supposing, apparently, that I had some
little reserve store which I wished to conceal from him.

18th and 19th.--I sent Bombay to the palace to beg for pombe, as it was the only thing I had
an appetite for, but the king would see no person but myself. He had broken his rifle washing-rod,
and this must be mended, the pages who brought it saying that no one dared take it back to
him until it was repaired. A guinea-fowl was sent after dark for me to see, as a proof that
the king was a sportsman complete.

20th.--The king going out shooting borrowed my powder-horn. The Wanguana mobbed the hut and
bullied me for food, merely because they did not like the trouble of helping themselves from
the king's garden, though they knew I had purchased their privilege to do so at the price of
a gold chronometer and the best guns England could produce.

21st.--I now, for the first time, saw the way in which the king collected his army together.
The highroads were all thronged with Waganda warriors, painted in divers colours, with plantain-leaf
bands round their heads, scanty goat-skin fastened to their loins, and spears and shield in
their hands, singing the tambure or march, ending with a repetition of the word Mkavia, or
Monarch. They surpassed in number, according to Bombay, the troops and ragamuffins enlisted
by Sultain Majid when Sayyid Sweni threatened to attack Zanzibar; in fact, he never saw such
a large army collected anywhere.

Bombay, on going to the palace, hoping to obtain plantains for the men, found the king holding
a levee, for the purpose of despatching this said army somewhere, but where no one would pronounce.
The king, then, observing my men who had gone to Unyoro together with Kamrasi's, questioned
them on their mission; and when told that no white men were there, he waxed wrathful, and said
it was a falsehood, for his men had seen them, and could not be mistaken. Kamrasi, he said,
must have hidden them somewhere, fearful of the number of guns which now surrounded him; and,
for the same reason, he told lies, yes, lies--but no man living shall dare tell himself lies;
and now, as he could not obtain his object by fair means, he would use arms and force it out.
Then, turning to Bombay, he said, "What does your master think of this business?" upon which
Bombay replied, according to his instructions, "Bana wishes nothing done until Grant arrives,
when all will go together." On this the king turned his back and walked away.

22d.--Kitunzi called on me early, because he heard I was sick. I asked him why the Waganda
objected to my sitting on a chair; but, to avoid the inconvenience of answering a troublesome
question, without replying, he walked off, saying he heard a noise in the neighbourhood of
the palace which must be caused by the king ordering some persons to be seized, and his presence
was so necessary he could not wait another moment. My men went for plantains to the palace
and for pombe on my behalf; but the king, instead of giving them anything, took two fez caps
off their heads, keeping them to himself, and ordered them to tell Bana all his beer was done.

23d.--Kidgwiga called on me to say Kamrasi so very much wanted the white men at Gani to visit
him, he had sent a hongo of thirty tusks to the chief of that country in hopes that it would
insure their coming to see him. He also felt sure if I went there his king would treat me with
the greatest respect. This afforded an opportunity for putting in a word of reconciliation.
I said that it was at my request that Mtesa sent Kamrasi a present; and so now, if Kamrasi
made friends with the Waganda, there would be no difficulty about the matter.

24th.--The army still thronged the highways, some going, others coming, like a swarm of ants,
the whole day long. Kidgwiga paid another visit, and I went to the palace without my gun, wishing
the king to fancy all my powder was done, as he had nearly consumed all my store; but the consequence
was that, after waiting the whole day, I never saw him at all. In the evening pages informed
me that Grant had arrived at N'yama Goma, one march distant.

25th.--I prepared twenty men, with a quarter of mutton for Grant to help him on the way, but
they could not go without a native officer, lest they should be seized, and no officer would
lead the way. The king came shooting close to my hut and ordered me out. I found him marching
Rozaro about in custody with four other Wanyambo, who, detected plundering by Kitunzi, had
set upon and beaten him severely. The king, pointing them out to me, said, he did not like
the system of plundering, and wished to know if it was the practice in Karague. Of course I
took the opportunity to renew my protest against the plundering system; but the king, changing
the subject, told me the Wazungu were at Gani inquiring after us, and wishing to come here.
To this I proposed fetching them myself in boats, but he objected, saying he would send men
first, for they were not farther off to the northward than the place he sent boats to, to bring
Grant. He said he did not like Unyoro, because Kamrasi hides himself like a Neptune in the
Nile, whenever his men go on a visit there, and instead of treating his guests with respect,
he keeps them beyond the river. For this reason he had himself determined on adopting the passage
by Kidi.

I was anxious, of course, to go on with the subject thus unexpectedly opened, but, as ill-luck
would have it, an adjutant was espied sitting on a tree, when a terrible fuss and excitement
ensued. The women were ordered one way and the attendants another, whilst I had to load the
gun on the best way I could with the last charge and a half left in the king's pouch. Ten grains
were all he would have allowed himself, reserving the residue, without reflecting that a large
bird required much shot; and he was shocked to find me lavishly use the whole, and still say
it was not enough.

The bird was then at a great height, so that the first shot merely tickled him, and drove him
to another tree. "Woh! woh!" cried the king, "I am sure he is hit; look there, look there;"
and away he rushed after the bird; down with one fence, then with another, in the utmost confusion,
everybody trying to keep his proper place, till at last the tree to which the bird had flown
was reached, and then, with the last charge of shot, the king killed his first nundo. As same fish last
parturition, the houses which contained the gamete can be arrived, and the fish of the secrets.
Later on specimen should be relinquish out for the boxes were into the ponds. I shall later to describe
how these lake, trays, and bandbox should be make.

The only lake might be made, if a possible, to the fall have promised
of king, and now as she may be securely emptied. This is an part which
is well overlooked by amateurs. Then began
congratulations and hand-shakings, and, finally, the inspection of the bird, which, by this
time, the Wasoga had thrown down. Oh! oh! what a wonder! Its wings outspread reached further
than the height of a man; we must go and show it to the brothers. Even that was not enough--we
must show it to the mother; and away we all rattled as fast as our legs could carry us.

Arrived at the queen's palace, out of respect to his mother, the king changed his European
clothes for a white kid-skin wrapper, and then walked in to see her, leaving us waiting outside.
By this time Colonel Congow, in his full-dress uniform, had arrived in the square outside,
with his regiment drawn up in review order. The king, hearing the announcement, at once came
out with spears and shield, preceded by the bird, and took post, standing armed, by the entrance,
encircled by his staff, all squatting, when the adjutant was placed in the middle of the company.
Before us was a large open square, with the huts of the queen's Kamraviona or commander-in-chief
beyond. The battalion, consisting of what might be termed three companies, each containing
200 men, being drawn up on the left extremity of the parade-ground, received orders to march
past in single file from the right of companies, at a long trot, and re-form again at the other
end of the square. Next they charged in companies to and fro; and, finally, the senior officers
came charging at their king, making violent professions of faith and honesty, for which they
were applauded. The parade then broke up, and all went home.

26th.--One of king Mtesa's officers now consenting to go to N'yama Goma with some of my men,
I sent Grant a quarter of goat. The reply brought to me was, that he was very thankful for
it; that he cooked it and ate it on the spot; and begged I would see the king, to get him released
from that starving place. Rozaro was given over to the custody of Kitunzi for punishment. At
the same time, the queen, having heard of the outrages committed against her brother and women,
commanded that neither my men nor any of Rozaro's should get any more food at the palace; for
as we all came to Uganda in one body, so all alike were, by her logic, answerable for the offence.
I called at the palace for explanation but could not obtain admittance because I would not
fire the gun.

27th.--The king sent to say he wanted medicine to propitiate lightning. I called and described
the effects of a lightning-rod, and tried to enter into the Unyoro business, wishing to go
there at once myself. He objected, because he had not seen Grant, but appointed an officer
to go through Unyoro on to Gani, and begged I would also send men with letters. Our talk was
agreeably interrupted by guns in the distance announcing Grant's arrival, and I took my leave
to welcome my friend. How we enjoyed ourselves after so much anxiety and want of one another's
company, I need not describe. For my part, I was only too rejoiced to see Grant could limp
about a bit, and was able to laugh over the picturesque and amusing account he gave me of his
own rough travels.

28th.--The king in the morning sent Budja, his ambassador, with Kamrasi's Kidgwiga, over to
me for my men and letters, to go to Kamrasi's again and ask for the road to Gani. I wished
to speak to the king first, but they said they had no orders to stop for that, and walked straight
away. I sent the king a present of a double-barrelled gun and ammunition, and received in answer
a request that both Grant and myself would attend a levee, which he was to hold in state, accompanied
by his bodyguard, as when I was first presented to him. In the afternoon we proceeded to court
accordingly, but found it scantily attended; and after the first sitting, which was speedily
over, retired to another court, and saw the women. Of this dumb show the king soon got tired;
he therefore called for his iron chair, and entered into conversation, at first about the ever-engrossing
subject of stimulants, till we changed it by asking him how he liked the gun? He pronounced
it a famous weapon, which he would use intensely. We then began to talk in a general way about
Suwarora and Rumanika, as well as the road through Unyamuezi, which we hoped would soon cease
to exist, and be superseded by one through Unyoro.

It will be kept in view that the hanging about at this court, and all the perplexing and irritating
negotiations here described, had always one end in view--that of reaching the Nile where it
pours out of the N'yanza, as I was long certain that it did. Without the consent and even the
aid of this capricious barbarian I was now talking to, such a project was hopeless. I naturally
seized every opportunity for putting in a word in the direction of my great object, and here
seemed to be an opportunity. We now ventured on a plump application for boats that we might
feel our way to Gani by water, supposing the lake and river to be navigable all the way; and
begged Kitunzi might be appointed to accompany us, in order that whatever was done might be
done all with good effect in opening up a new line of commerce, by which articles of European
manufacture might find a permanent route to Uganda. It was "no go," however. The appeal, though
listened to, and commented on, showing that it was well understood, got no direct reply. It
was not my policy to make our object appear too important to ourselves, so I had to appear
tolerably indifferent, and took the opportunity to ask for my paint-box, which he had borrowed
for a day and had kept in his possession for months. I got no answer to that request either,
but was immediately dunned for the compass, which had been promised on Grant's arrival. Now,
with a promise that the compass would be sent him in the morning, he said he would see what
pombe his women could spare us; and, bidding good evening, walked away.

29th.--I sent Bombay with the compass, much to the delight of the king, who no sooner saw it
than he jumped and woh-wohed with intense excitement at the treasure he had gained, said it
was the greatest present Bana had ever given him, for it was the thing by which he found out
all the roads and countries--it was, in fact, half his knowledge; and the parting with it showed
plainly that Bana entertained an everlasting friendship for him. The king then called Maula,
and said, "Maula, indeed you have spoken the truth; there is nothing like this instrument,"
etc., etc., repeating what he had already told Bombay. In the evening, the king, accompanied
by all his brothers, with iron chair and box, came to visit us, and inspected all Grant's recently
brought pictures of the natives, with great acclamation. We did not give him anything this
time, but, instead, dunned him for the paint-box, and afterwards took a walk to my observatory
hill, where I acted as guide. On the summit of this hill the king instructed his brothers on
the extent of his dominions; and as I asked where Lubari or God resides, he pointed to the skies.

30th.--The king at last sent the paint-box, with some birds of his own shooting, which he wished
painted. He also wanted himself drawn, and all Grant's pictures copied. Then, to wind up these
mild requests, a demand was made for more powder, and that all our guns be sent to the palace
for inspection.

31st.--I drew a large white and black hornbill and a green pigeon sent by himself; but he was
not satisfied; he sent more birds, and wanted to see my shoes. The pages who came with the
second message, however, proving impertinent, got a book flung at their heads, and a warning
to be off, as I intended to see the king myself, and ask for food to keep my ever-complaining
Wanguana quiet. Proceeding to the palace, as I found Mtesa had gone out shooting, I called
on the Kamraviona, complained that my camp was starving, and as I had nothing left to give
the king said I wished to leave the country. Ashamed of its being supposed that his king would
not give me any food because I had no more presents to give him, the Kamraviona, from his own
stores, gave me a goat and pombe, and said he would speak to the king on the subject.

1st.--I drew for the king a picture of a guinea-fowl which he shot in the early morning, and
proceeded on a visit with Grant to the queen's, accompanied only by seven men, as the rest
preferred foraging for themselves, to the chance of picking up a few plantains at her majesty's.
After an hour's waiting, the queen received us with smiles, and gave pombe and plantains to
her new visitor, stating pointedly she had none for me. There was deep Uganda policy in this:
it was for the purpose of treating Grant as a separate, independent person, and so obtaining
a fresh hongo or tax. Laughing at the trick, I thanked her for the beer, taking it personally
on my household, and told her when my property arrived from Karague, she should have a few
more things as I promised her; but the men sent had neither brought my brother in a vessel,
as they were ordered, not did they bring my property from Karague.

Still the queen was not content: she certainly expected something from Grant, if it was ever
so little, for she was entitled to it, and would not listen to our being one house. Turning
the subject, to put in a word for my great object, I asked her to use her influence in opening
the road to Gani, as, after all, that was the best way to get new things into Uganda. Cunning
as a fox, the queen agreed to this project, provided Grant remained behind, for she had not
seen enough of him yet, and she would speak to her son about the matter in the morning.

This was really the first gleam of hope, and I set to putting our future operations into a
shape that might lead to practical results without alarming our capricious host. I thought
that whilst I could be employed in inspecting the river, and in feeling the route by water
to Gani, Grant could return to Karague by water, bringing up our rear traps, and, in navigating
the lake, obtain the information he had been frustrated in getting by the machinations of his
attendant Maribu. It was agreed to, and all seemed well; for there was much left to be done
in Uganda and Usoga, if we could only make sure of communicating once with Petherick. Before
going home we had some more polite conversation, during which the queen played with a toy in
the shape of a cocoa du mer, studded all over with cowries: this was a sort of doll, or symbol
of a baby and her dandling it was held to indicate that she would ever remain a widow. In the
evening the king returned all our rifles and guns, with a request for one of them; as also
for the iron chair he sat upon when calling on us, an iron bedstead, and the Union Jack, for
he did not honour us with a visit for nothing; and the head page was sent to witness the transfer
of the goods, and see there was no humbug about it. It was absolutely necessary to get into
a rage, and tell the head page we did not come to Uganda to be swindled in that manner, and
he might tell the king I would not part with one of them.

2d.--K'yengo, who came with Grant, now tried to obtain an interview with the king, but could
not get admission. I had some further trouble about the disposal of the child Meri, who said
she never before had lived in a poor man's house since she was born. I thought to content her
by offering to marry her to one of Rumanika's sons, a prince of her own breed, but she would
not listen to the proposal.

3d.--For days past, streams of men have been carrying faggots of firewood, clean-cut timber,
into the palaces of the king, queen, and the Kamraviona; and to-day, on calling on the king,
I found him engaged having these faggots removed by Colonel Mkavia's regiment from one court
into another, this being his way of ascertaining their quantity, instead of counting them.
About 1600 men were engaged on this service, when the king, standing on a carpet in front of
the middle hut of the first court, with two spears in his hand and his dog by his side, surrounded
by his brothers and a large staff of officers, gave orders for the regiment to run to and fro
in column, that he might see them well; then turning to his staff, ordered them to run up and
down the regiment, and see what they thought of it. This ridiculous order set them all flying,
and soon they returned, charging at the king with their sticks, dancing and jabbering that
their numbers were many, he was the greatest king on earth, and their lives and services were
his for ever. The regiment now received orders to put down their faggots, and, taking up their
own sticks in imitation of spears, followed the antics of their officers in charging and vociferating.
Next, Mkavia presented five hairy Usoga goats, n'yanzigging and performing the other appropriate
ceremonies. On asking the king if he had any knowledge of the extent of his army, he merely
said, "How can I, when these you see are a portion of them just ordered here to carry wood?"

The regiment was now dismissed; but the officers were invited to follow the king into another
court, when he complimented them on assembling so many men; they, instead of leaving well alone,
foolishly replied they were sorry they were not more numerous, as some of the men lived so
far away they shirked the summons; Maula, then, ever forward in mischief, put a cap on it by
saying, if he could only impress upon the Waganda to listen to his orders, there would never
be a deficiency. Upon which the king said, "If they fail to obey you, they disobey me; for
I have appointed you as my orderly, and thereby you personify the orders of the king." Up jumped
Maula in a moment as soon as these words were uttered, charging with his stick, then floundering
and n'yanzigging as if he had been signally rewarded. I expected some piece of cruel mischief
to come of all this, but the king, in his usual capricious way, suddenly rising, walked off
to a third court, followed only by a select few.

Here, turning to me, he said, "Bana, I love you, because you have come so far to see me, and
have taught me so many things since you have been here." Rising, with my hand to my heart,
and gracefully bowing at this strange announcement--for at that moment I was full of hunger
and wrath--I intimated I was much flattered at hearing it, but as my house was in a state of
starvation, I trusted he would consider it. "What!" said he, "do you want goats?" "Yes, very
much." The pages then received orders to furnish me with ten that moment, as the king's farmyard
was empty, and he would reimburse them as soon as more confiscations took place. But this,
I said, was not enough; the Wanguana wanted plantains, for they had received none these fifteen
days. "What!" said the king, turning to his pages again, "have you given these men no plantains,
as I ordered? Go and fetch them this moment, and pombe too, for Bana."

The subject then turned on the plan I had formed of going to Gani by water, and of sending
Grant to Karague by the lake; but the king's mind was fully occupied with the compass I had
given him. He required me to explain its use, and then broke up the meeting.

4th.--Viarungi, an officer sent by Rumanika to escort Grant to Uganda, as well as to apply
to king Mtesa for a force to fight his brother Rogero, called on me with Rozaro, and said he
had received instructions from his king to apply to me for forty cows and two slave-boys, because
the Arabs who pass through his country to Uganda always make him a present of that sort after
receiving them from Mtesa. After telling him we English never give the presents they have received
away to any one, and never make slaves, but free them, I laid a complaint against Rozaro for
having brought much trouble and disgrace upon my camp, as well as much trouble on myself, and
begged that he might be removed from my camp. Rozaro then attempted to excuse himself, but
without success, and said he had already detached his residence from my camp, and taken up
a separate residence with Viarungi, his superior officer.

I called on the king in the afternoon, and found the pages had already issued plantains for
my men and pombe for myself. The king addressed me with great cordiality, and asked if I wished
to go to Gani. I answered him with all promptitude,--Yes, at once, with some of his officers
competent to judge of the value of all I point out to them for future purposes in keeping the
road permanently open. His provoking capriciousness, however, again broke in, and he put me
off till his messengers should return from Unyoro. I told him his men had gone in vain, for
Budja left without my letter or my men; and further, that the river route is the only one that
will ever be of advantage to Uganda, and the sooner it was opened up the better. I entreated
him to listen to my advice, and send some of my men to Kamrasi direct, to acquaint him with
my intention to go down the river in boats to him; but I could get no answer to this. Bombay
then asked for cows for the Wanguana, getting laughed at for his audacity, and the king broke
up the court and walked away.

5th.--I started on a visit to the queen, but half-way met Congow, who informed me he had just
escorted her majesty from his house, where she was visiting, to her palace. By way of a joke
and feeler, I took it in my head to try, by taking a harmless rise out of Congow, whether the
Nile is understood by the natives to be navigable near its exit from the N'yanza. I told him
he had been appointed by the king to escort us down the river to Gani. He took the affair very
seriously, delivering himself to the following purport: "Well, then, my days are numbered;
for if I refuse compliance I shall lose my head; and if I attempt to pass Kamrasi's, which
is on the river, I shall lose my life; for I am a marked man there, having once led an army
past his palace and back again. It would be no use calling it a peaceful mission, as you propose;
for the Wanyoro distrust the Waganda to such an extent, they would fly to arms at once."

Proceeding to the queen's palace, we met Murondo, who had once travelled to the Masai frontier.
He said it would take a month to go in boats from Kira, the most easterly district in Uganda,
to Masai, where there is another N'yanza, joined by a strait to the big N'yanza, which king
Mtesa's boats frequent for salt; but the same distance could be accomplished in four days overland,
and three days afterwards by boat. The queen, after keeping us all day waiting, sent three
bunches of plantains and a pot of pombe, with a message that she was too tired to receive visitors,
and hoped we would call another day.

6th.--I met Pokino, the governor-general of Uddu, in the morning's walk, who came here at the
same time as Grant to visit the king, and was invited into his house to drink pombe. His badge
of office is an iron hatchet, inlaid with copper and handled with ivory. He wished to give
us a cow, but put it off for another day, and was surprised we dared venture into his premises
without permission from the king. After this, we called at the palace, just as the king was
returning from a walk with his brothers. He saw us, and sent for Bana. We entered, and presented
him with some pictures, which he greatly admired, looked at close and far, showed to the brothers,
and inspected again. Pokino at this time came in with a number of well-made shields, and presented
them grovelling and n'yanzigging; but though the governor of an important province, who had
not been seen by the king for years, he was taken no more notice of than any common Mkungu.
A plan of the lake and Nile, which I brought with me to explain our projects for reaching Karague
and Gani, engaged the king's attention for a while; but still he would not agree to let anything
be done until the messenger returned from Unyoro. Finding him inflexible, I proposed sending
a letter, arranging that his men should be under the guidance of my men after they pass Unyoro
on the way to Gani; and this was acceded to, provided I should write a letter to Petherick
by the morrow. I then tried to teach the king the use of the compass. To make a stand for it,
I turned a drum on its head, when all the courtiers flew at me as if to prevent an outrage,
and the king laughed. I found that, as the instrument was supposed to be a magic charm of very
wonderful powers, my meddling with it and treating it as an ordinary movable was considered
a kind of sacrilege.

7th.--I wrote a letter to Petherick, but the promised Wakungu never came for it. As K'yengo
was ordered to attend court with Rumanika's hongo, consisting of a few wires, small beads,
and a cloth I gave him, as well as a trifle from Nnanji, I sent Bombay, in place of going myself,
to remind the king of his promises for the Wakungu to Gani, as well as for boats to Karague,
but a grunt was the only reply which my messenger said he obtained.

8th.--Calling at the palace, I found the king issuing for a walk, and joined him, when he suddenly
turned round in the rudest manner, re-entered his palace, and left me to go home without speaking
a word. The capricious creature then reissued, and, finding me gone, inquired after me, presuming
I ought to have waited for him.

9th.--During the night, when sleeping profoundly, some person stealthily entered my hut and
ran off with a box of bullets towards the palace, but on the way dropped his burden. Maula,
on the way home, happening to see it, and knowing it to be mine, brought it back again. I stayed
at home, not feeling well.

10th.--K'yengo paid his hongo in wire to the king, and received a return of six cows. Still
at home, an invalid, I received a visit from Meri, who seemed to have quite recovered herself.
Speaking of her present quarters, she said she loved Uledi's wife very much, thinking birds
of a feather ought to live together. She helped herself to a quarter of mutton, and said she
would come again.

11th.--To-day Viarungi, finding Rozaro's men had stolen thirty cows, twelve slaves, and a load
of mbugu from the Waganda, laid hands on them himself for Rumanika, instead of giving them
to King Mtesa. Such are the daily incidents among our neighbours.

 A man
with a maniacal voice sang and whistled by turns. Katumba, the officer of the guards, saw our
pictures, and being a favourite, acquainted the king, which gained us an admittance.

We found his majesty sitting on the ground, within a hut, behind a portal, encompassed by his
women, and took our seats outside. At first all was silence, till one told the king we had
some wonderful pictures to show him; in an instant he grew lively, crying out, "Oh, let us
see them!" and they were shown, Bombay explaining. Three of the king's wives then came in,
and offered him their two virgin sisters, n'yanzigging incessantly, and beseeching their acceptance,
as by that means they themselves would become doubly related to him. Nothing, however, seemed
to be done to promote the union, until one old lady, sitting by the king's side, who was evidently
learned in the etiquette and traditions of the court, said, "Wait and see if he embraces, otherwise
you may know he is not pleased." At this announcement the girls received a hint to pass on,
and the king commenced bestowing on them a series of huggings, first sitting on the lap of
one, whom he clasped to his bosom, crossing his neck with hers to the right, then to the left,
and, having finished with her, took post in the second one's lap, then on that of the third,
performing on each of them the same evolutions. He then retired to his original position, and
the marriage ceremony was supposed to be concluded, and the settlements adjusted, when all
went on as before.

The pictures were again looked at, and again admired, when we asked for a private interview
on business, and drew the king outside. I then begged he would allow me, whilst his men were
absent at Unyoro, to go to the Masai country, and see the Salt Lake at the north-east corner
of the N'yanza, and to lend me some of his boats for Grant to fetch powder and beads from Karague.
This important arrangement being conceded by the king more promptly than we expected, a cow,
plantains, and pombe were requested; but the cow only was given, though our men were said to
be feeding on grass. Taking the king, as it appeared, in a good humour, to show him the abuses
arising from the system of allowing his guests to help themselves by force upon the highways,
I reported the late seizures made of thirty cows and twelve slaves by the Wanyambo; but, though
surprised to hear the news, he merely remarked that there were indeed a great number of visitors
in Uganda. During this one day we heard the sad voice of no less than four women, dragged from
the palace to the slaughter-house.

19th.--To follow up our success in the marching question and keep the king to his promise,
I called at his palace, but found he had gone out shooting. To push my object further, I then
marched off to the queen's to bid her good-bye, as if we were certain to leave the next day;
but as no one would dare to approach her cabinet to apprise her of our arrival, we returned
home tired and annoyed.

20th.--The king sent for us at noon; but when we reached the palace we found he had started
on a shooting tour; so, to make the best of our time, we called again upon the queen for the
same purpose as yesterday, as also to get my books of birds and animals, which, taken merely
to look at for a day or so, had been kept for months. After hours of waiting, her majesty appeared
standing in an open gateway; beckoned us to advance, and offered pombe; then, as two or three
drops of rain fell, she said she could not stand the violence of the weather, and forthwith
retired without one word being obtained. An officer, however, venturing in for the books, at
length I got them.

21st.--To-day I went to the palace, but found no one; the king was out shooting again.

22d.--We resolved to-day to try on a new political influence at the court. Grant had taken
to the court of Karague a jumping-jack, to amuse the young princes; but it had a higher destiny,
for it so fascinated the king Rumanika himself that he would not part with it--unless, indeed,
Grant would make him a big one out of a tree which was handed to him for the purpose. We resolved
to try the influence of such a toy on king Mtesa, and brought with us, in addition, a mask
and some pictures. But although the king took a visiting card, the gate was never opened to
us. Finding this, and the day closing, we deposited the mask and pictures on a throne, and
walked away. We found that we had thus committed a serious breach of state etiquette; for the
guard, as soon as they saw what we had done, seized the Wanguana for our offences in defiling
the royal seat, and would have bound them, had they not offered to return the articles to us.

23d.--Early in the morning, hearing the royal procession marching off on a shooting excursion,
we sent Bombay running after it with the mask and pictures, to aquaint the king with our desire
to see him, and explain that we had been four days successively foiled in attempts to find
him in his palace, our object being an eager wish to come to some speedy understanding about
the appointed journeys to the Salt Lake and Karague. The toys produced the desired effect;
for the king stopped and played with them, making Bombay and the pages don the masks by turns.
He appointed the morrow for an interview, at the same time excusing himself for not having
seen us yesterday on the plea of illness. In the evening Kahala absconded with another little
girl of the camp in an opposite direction from the one she took last time; but as both of them
wandered about not knowing where to go to, and as they omitted to take off all their finery,
they were soon recognised as in some way connected with my party, taken up, and brought into
camp, where they were well laughed at for their folly, and laughed in turn at the absurdity
of their futile venture.

24th.--Hoping to keep the king to his promise, I went to the palace early, but found he had
already gone to see his brothers, so followed him down, and found him engaged playing on a
harmonicon with them. Surprised at my intrusion, he first asked how I managed to find him out;
then went on playing for a while; but suddenly stopping to talk with me, he gave me an opportunity
of telling him I wished to send Grant off to Karague, and start myself for Usoga and the Salt
Lake in the morning. "What! going away?" said the king, as if he had never heard a word about
it before; and then, after talking the whole subject over again, especially dwelling on the
quantity of powder I had in store at Karague, he promised to send the necessary officers for
escorting us on our respective journeys in the morning.

The brothers' wives then wished to see me, and came before us, when I had to take off my hat
and shoes as usual, my ready compliance inducing the princes to pass various compliments of
my person and disposition. The brothers then showed me a stool made of wood after the fashion
of our sketching-stool, and a gun-cover of leather, made by themselves, of as good workmanship
as is to be found in India. The king then rose, followed by his brothers, and we all walked
off to the pond. The effect of stimulants was mooted, as well as other physiological phenomena,
when a second move took us to the palace by torchlight, and the king showed a number of new
huts just finished and beautifully made. Finally, he settled down to a musical concert, in
which he took the lead himself. At eight o'clock, being tired and hungry, I reminded the king
of his promises, and he appointed the morning to call on him for the Wakungu, and took leave.

25th.--Makinga, hearing of the intended march through Usoga, was pleased to say he would like
to join my camp and spend his time in buying slaves and ivory there. I went to the palace for
the promised escort, but was no sooner announced by the pages than the king walked off into
the interior of his harem, and left me no alternative but to try my luck with the Kamraviona,
who, equally proud with his master, would not answer my call,--and so another day was lost.

26th.--This morning we had the assuring intelligence from Kaddu that he had received orders
to hold himself in readiness for a voyage to Karague in twenty boats with Grant, but the date
of departure was not fixed. The passage was expected to be rough, as the water off the mouth
of the Kitangule Kagera (river) always runs high, so that no boats can go there except at night,
when the winds of day subside, and are replaced by the calms of night. I called at the palace,
but saw nothing of the king, though the court was full of officials; and there were no less
than 150 women, besides girls, goats, and various other things, seizures from refractory state
officers, who, it was said, had been too proud to present themselves at court for a period
exceeding propriety.

All these creatures, I was assured, would afterwards be given away as return-presents for the
hongos or presents received from the king's visitors. No wonder the tribes of Africa are mixed
breeds. Amongst the officers in waiting was my friend Budja, the ambassador that had been sent
to Unyoro with Kidgwiga, Kamrasi's deputy. He had returned three days before, but had not yet
seen the king. As might have been expected, he said he had been anything but welcomed in Unyoro.
Kamrasi, after keeping him half-starved and in suspense eight days, sent a message--for he
would not see him--that he did not desire any communication with blackguard Waganda thieves,
and therefore advised him, if he valued his life, to return by the road by which he came as
speedily as possible. Turning to Congow, I playfully told him that, as the road through Unyoro
was closed, he would have to go with me through Usoga and Kidi; but the gallant colonel merely
shuddered, and said that would be a terrible undertaking.

27th.--The king would not show, for some reason or other, and we still feared to fire guns
lest he should think our store of powder inexhaustible, and so keep us here until he had extorted
the last of it. I found that the Waganda have the same absurd notion here as the Wanyambo have
in Karague, of Kamrasi's supernatural power in being able to divide the waters of the Nile
in the same manner as Moses did the Red Sea.

28th.--The king sent a messenger-boy to inform us that he had just heard from Unyoro that the
white men were still at Gani inquiring after us; but nothing was said of Budja's defeat. He
answered that he would assemble all his officers in the morning to consult with them on the
subject, when he hoped we would attend, as he wished to further our views. A herd of cows,
about eighty in number, were driven in from Unyoro, showing that the silly king was actually
robbing Kamrasi at the same time that he was trying to treat with him. K'yengo informed us
that the king, considering the surprising events which had lately occurred at his court, being
very anxious to pry into the future, had resolved to take a very strong measure for accomplishing
that end. This was the sacrifice of a child by cooking, as described in the introduction--a
ceremony which it fell to K'yengo to carry out.

29th.--To have two strings to my bow, and press our departure as hotly as possible, I sent
first Frij off with Nasib to the queen, conveying, as a parting present, a block-tin brush-box,
a watch without a key, two sixpenny pocket-handkerchiefs, and a white towel, with an intimation
that we were going, as the king had expressed his desire of sending us to Gani. Her majesty
accepted the present, finding fault with the watch for not ticking like the king's, and would
not believe her son Mtesa had been so hasty in giving us leave to depart, as she had not been
consulted on the subject yet. Setting off to attend the king at his appointed time, I found
the Kamraviona already there, with a large court attendance, patiently awaiting his majesty's
advent. As we were all waiting on, I took a rise out of the Kamraviona by telling him I wanted
a thousand men to march with me through Kidi to Gani. Surprised at the extent of my requisition,
he wished to know if my purpose was fighting. I made him a present of the great principle that
power commands respect, and it was to prevent any chance of fighting that we required so formidable
an escort. His reply was that he would tell the king; and he immediately rose and walked away home.

K'yengo and the representatives of Usui and Karague now arrived by order of the king to bid
farewell, and received the slaves and cattle lately captured. As I was very hungry, I set off
home to breakfast. Just as I had gone, the provoking king inquired after me, and so brought
me back again, though I never saw him the whole day. K'yengo, however, was very communicative.
He said he was present when Sunna, with all the forces he could muster, tried to take the very
countries I now proposed to travel through; but, though in person exciting his army to victory,
he could make nothing of it. He advised my returning to Karague, when Rumanika would give me
an escort through Nkole to Unyoro; but finding that did not suit my views, as I swore I would
never retrace one step, he proposed my going by boat to Unyoro, following down the Nile.

This, of course, was exactly what I wanted; but how could king Mtesa, after the rebuff he had
received from Kamrasi be induced to consent to it? My intention, I said, was to try the king
on the Usoga and Kidi route first, then on the Masai route to Zanzibar, affecting perfect indifference
about Kamrasi; and all those failing--which, of course, they would--I would ask for Unyoro
as a last and only resource. Still I could not see the king to open my heart to him, and therefore
felt quite nonplussed. "Oh," says K'yengo, "the reason why you do not see him is merely because
he is Ashamed to show his face, having made so many fair promises to you which he knows he
can never carry out: bide your time, and all will be well." At 4 p.m., as no hope of seeing
the king was left, all retired.

30th.--Unexpectedly, and for reasons only known to himself, the king sent us a cow and load
of butter, which had been asked for many days ago. The new moon seen last night kept the king
engaged at home, paying his devotions with his magic horns or fetishes in the manner already
described. The spirit of this religion--if such it can be called--is not so much adoration
of a Being supreme and beneficent, as a tax to certain malignant furies--a propitiation, in
fact, to prevent them bringing evil on the land, and to insure a fruitful harvest. It was rather
ominous that hail fell with violence, and lightning burnt down one of the palace huts, while
the king was in the midst of his propitiatory devotions.

1st.--As Bombay was ordered to the palace to instruct the king in the art of casting bullets,
I primed him well to plead for the road, and he reported to me the results, thus: First, he
asked one thousand men to go through Kidi. This the king said was impracticable, as the Waganda
had tried it so often before without success. Then, as that could not be managed, what would
the king devise himself? Bana only proposed the Usoga and Kidi route, because he thought it
would be to the advantage of Uganda. "Oh," says the king, cunningly, "if Bana merely wishes
to see Usoga, he can do so, and I will send a suitable escort, but no more." To this Bombay
replied, "Bana never could return; he would sooner do anything than return--even penetrate
the Masai to Zanzibar, or go through Unyoro"; to which the king, ashamed of his impotence,
hung down his head and walked away.

In the meanwhile, and whilst this was going on at the king's palace, I went with Grant, by
appointment, to see the queen. As usual, she kept us waiting some time, then appeared sitting
by an open gate, and invited us, together with many Wakungu and Wasumbua to approach. Very
lavish with stale sour pombe, she gave us all some, saving the Wasumbua, whom she addressed
very angrily, asking what they wanted, as they have been months in the country. These poor
creatures, in a desponding mood, defended themselves by saying, which was quite true, that
they had left their homes in Sorombo to visit her, and to trade. They had, since their arrival
in the country, been daily in attendance at her palace, but never had the good fortune to see
her excepting on such lucky occasions as brought the Wazungu (white men) here, when she opened
her gates to them, but otherwise kept them shut. The queen retorted, "And what have you brought
me, pray? where is it? Until I touch it you will neither see me nor obtain permission to trade.
Uganda is no place for idle vagabonds." We then asked for a private interview, when, a few
drops of rain falling, the queen walked away, and we had orders to wait a little. Seat is outside,

and which had make that eld when he appeared upon skin except to start and believe or to dwell
up and leftover.
 This announcement made the king reflect; for he had been privately primed
by his mother's attendants, that we both wished to go to Gani, and therefore shrewdly inquired
if Rumanika knew we wished to visit Kamrasi, and whether he was aware we should attempt the
passage north from Uganda. "Oh yes! of course Bana wrote to Bana Mdogo" (the little master)
"as soon as he arrived in Uganda and told him and Rumanika all about it." "Wrote! what does
that mean?" and I was called upon to explain. Mtesa, then seeing a flaw in K'yengo's statements,
called him a story-teller; ordered him and his party away, and bade me draw near.

The moment of triumph had come at last, and suddenly the road was granted! The king presently
let us see the motive by which he had been influenced. He said he did not like having to send
to Rumanika for everything: he wanted his visitors to come to him direct; moreover, Rumanika
had sent him a message to the effect that we were not to be shown anything out of Uganda, and
when we had done with it, were to be returned to him. Rumanika, indeed! who cared about Rumanika?
Was not Mtesa the king of the country, to do as he liked? and we all laughed. Then the king,
swelling with pride, asked me whom I liked best--Rumanika or himself,--an awkward question,
which I disposed of by saying I liked Rumanika very much because he spoke well, and was very
communicative; but I also liked Mtesa, because his habits were much like my own--fond of shooting
and roaming about; whilst he had learned so many things from my teaching, I must ever feel
a yearning towards him.

With much satisfaction I felt that my business was now done; for Budja was appointed to escort
us to Unyoro, and Jumba to prepare us boats, that we might go all the way to Kamrasi's by water.
Viarungi made a petition, on Rumanika's behalf, for an army of Waganda to go to Karague, and
fight the refractory brother, Rogero; but this was refused, on the plea that the whole army
was out fighting at the present moment. The court then broke up and we went home.

To keep the king up to the mark, and seal our passage, in the evening I took a Lancaster rifle,
with ammunition, and the iron chair he formerly asked for, as a parting present, to the palace,
but did not find him, as he had gone out shooting with his brothers.

4th.--Grant and I now called together on the king to present the rifle, chair, and ammunition,
as we could not thank him in words sufficiently for the favour he had done us in granting the
road through Unyoro. I said the parting gift was not half as much as I should like to have
been able to give; but we hoped, on reaching Gani, to send Petherick up to him with everything
that he could desire. We regretted we had no more powder or shot, as what was intended, and
actually placed out expressly to be presented on this occasion, was stolen. The king looked
hard at his head page, who was once sent to get these very things now given, and then turning
the subject adroitly, asked me how many cows and women I would like, holding his hand up with
spread fingers, and desiring me to count by hundreds; but the reply was, Five cows and goats
would be enough, for we wished to travel lightly in boats, starting from the Murchison Creek.
Women were declined on such grounds as would seem rational to him. But if the king would clothe
my naked men with one mbugu (bark cloth) each, and give a small tusk each to nine Wanyamuezi
porters, who desired to return to their home, the obligation would be great.

Everything was granted without the slightest hesitation; and then the king, turning to me,
said, "Well, Bana, so you really wish to go?" "Yes, for I have not seen my home for four years
and upwards"--reckoning five months to the year, Uganda fashion. "And you can give no stimulants?"
"No." "Then you will send me some from Gani--brandy if you like; it makes people sleep sound,
and gives them strength." Next we went to the queen to bid her farewell, but did not see her.

On returning home I found half my men in a state of mutiny. They had been on their own account
to beg for the women and cows which had been refused, saying, If Bana does not want them we
do, for we have been starved here ever since we came, and when we go for food get broken heads;
we will not serve with Bana any longer; but as he goes north, we will return to Karague and
Unyanyembe. Bombay, however, told them they never had fed so well in all their lives as they
had in Uganda, counting from fifty to sixty cows killed, and pombe and plantains every day,
whenever they took the trouble to forage; and for their broken heads they invariably received
a compensation in women; so that Bana had reason to regret every day spent in asking for food
for them at the palace--a favour which none but his men received, but which they had not, as
they might have done, turned to good effect by changing the system of plundering for food in
Uganda.

5th.--By the king's order we attended at the palace early. The gun obtained us all a speedy
admittance, when the king opened conversation by saying, "Well, Bana, so you really are going?"
"Yes; I have enjoyed your hospitality for a long time, and now wish to return to my home."
"What provision do you want?" I said, Five cows and five goats, as we shan't be long in Uganda;
and it is not the custom of our country, when we go visiting, to carry anything away with us.
The king then said, "Well, I wish to give you much, but you won't have it"; when Budja spoke
out, saying, "Bana does not know the country he had to travel through; there is nothing but
jungle and famine on the way, and he must have cows"; on which the king ordered us sixty cows,
fourteen goats, ten loads of butter, a load of coffee and tobacco, one hundred sheets of mbugu,
as clothes for my men, at a suggestion of Bombay's, as all my cloth had been expended even
before I left Karague.

This magnificent order created a pause, which K'yengo took advantage of by producing a little
bundle of peculiarly-shaped sticks and a lump of earth--all of which have their own particular
magical powers, as K'yengo described to the king's satisfaction. After this, Viarungi pleaded
the cause of my mutinous followers, till I shook my finger angrily at him before the king,
rebuked him for intermeddling in other people's affairs, and told my own story, which gained
the sympathy of the king, and induced him to say, "Supposing they desert Bana, what road do
they expect to get?" Maula was now appointed to go with Rozaro to Karague for the powder and
other things promised yesterday, whilst Viarungi and all his party, though exceedingly anxious
to get away, had orders to remain here prisoners as a surety for the things arriving. Further,
Kaddu and two other Wakungu received orders to go to Usui with two tusks of ivory to purchase
gunpowder, caps, and flints, failing which they would proceed to Unyanyembe, and even to Zanzibar,
for the king must not be disappointed, and failure would cost them their lives.

Not another word was said, and away the two parties went, with no more arrangement than a set
of geese--Maula without a letter, and Kaddu without any provision for the way, as if all the
world belonged to Mtesa, and he could help himself from any man's garden that he liked, no
matter where he was. In the evening my men made a humble petition for their discharge, even
if I did not pay them, producing a hundred reasons for wishing to leave me, but none which
would stand a moment's argument: the fact was, they were afraid of the road to Unyoro, thinking
I had not sufficient ammunition.

6th.--I visited the king, and asked leave for boats to go at once; but the fleet admiral put
a veto on this by making out that dangerous shallows exist between the Murchison Creek and
the Kira district station, so that the boats of one place never visit the other; and further,
if we went to Kira, we should find impracticable cataracts to the Urondogani boat-station;
our better plan would therefore be, to deposit our property at the Urondogani station, and
walk by land up the river, if a sight of the falls at the mouth of the lake was of such material
consequence to us.

Of course this man carried everything his own way, for there was nobody able to contradict
him, and we could not afford time to visit Usoga first, lest by the delay we might lose an
opportunity of communicating with Petherick. Grant now took a portrait of Mtesa by royal permission,
the king sitting as quietly as his impatient nature would permit. Then at home the Wanyamuezi
porters received their tusks of ivory, weighing from 16 to 50 lb. each, and took a note besides
on Rumanika each for twenty fundo of beads, barring one Bogue man, who, having lent a cloth
to the expedition some months previously, thought it would not be paid him, and therefore seized
a sword as security; the consequence was, his tusk was seized until the sword was returned,
and he was dismissed minus his beads, for having so misconducted himself. The impudent fellow
then said, "It will be well for Bana if he succeeds in getting the road through Unyoro; for,
should he fail, I will stand in his path at Bogue." Kitunzi offered an ivory for beads, and
when told we were not merchants, and advised to try K'yengo, he said he dared not even approach
K'yengo's camp lest people should tell the king of it, and accuse him of seeking for magical
powers against his sovereign. Old Nasib begged for his discharge. It was granted, and he took
a $50 letter on the coast, and a letter of emancipation for himself and family, besides an
order, written in Kisuahili, for ten fundo of beads on Rumanika, which made him very happy.

In the evening we called again at the palace with pictures of the things the king required
from Rumanika, and a letter informing Rumanika what we wished done with them, in order that
there might be no mistake, requesting the king to forward them after Mula. Just then Kaddu's
men returned to say they wanted provisions for the way, as the Wazinza, hearing of their mission,
asked them if they knew what they were about, going to a strange country without any means
of paying their way. But the king instead of listening to reason, impetuously said, "If you
do not pack off at once, and bring me the things I want, every man of you shall lose his head;
and as for the Wazinza, for interfering with my orders, they shall be kept here prisoners until
you return."

On the way home, one of the king's favourite women overtook us, walking, with her hands clasped
at the back of her head, to execution, crying, "N'uawo!" in the most pitiful manner. A man
was preceding her, but did not touch her; for she loved to obey the orders of her king voluntarily,
and in consequence of previous attachment, was permitted, as a mark of distinction, to walk
free. Wondrous world! it was not ten minutes since we parted from the king, yet he had found
time to transact this bloody piece of business.

7th.--Early in the morning the king bade us come to him to say farewell. Wishing to leave behind
a favourable impression, I instantly complied. On the breast of my coat I suspended the necklace
the queen had given me, as well as his knife, and my medals. I talked with him in as friendly
and flattering a manner as I could, dwelling on his shooting, the pleasant cruising on the
lake, and our sundry picnics, as well as the grand prospect there was now of opening the country
to trade, by which his guns, the best in the world, would be fed with powder--and other small
matters of a like nature,--to which he replied with great feeling and good taste.

We had, however, scarcely quitted the palace gate before the king issued himself, with his
attendants and his brothers leading, and women bringing up the rear; here K'yengo and all the
Wazinza joined in the procession with ourselves, they kneeling and clapping their hands after
the fashion of their own country. Budja just then made me feel very anxious, by pointing out
the position of Urondogani, as I thought, too far north. I called the king's attention to it,
and in a moment he said he would speak to Budja in such a manner that would leave no doubts
in my mind, for he liked me much, and desired to please me in all things. As the procession
now drew to our camp, and Mtesa expressed a wish to have a final look at my men, I ordered
them to turn out with their arms and n'yanzig for the many favours they had received. Mtesa,
much pleased, complimented them on their goodly appearance, remarking that with such a force
I would have no difficulty in reaching Gani, and exhorted them to follow me through fire and
water; then exchanging adieus again he walked ahead in gigantic strides up the hill, the pretty
favourite of his harem, Lubuga--beckoning and waving with her little hands, and crying, "Bana!
Bana!"--trotting after him conspicuous amongst the rest, though all showed a little feeling
at the severance. We saw them no more.

Falls--General Account of the Source of the Nile--Descend again to Urondogani--The Truculent
Sakibobo.

7th to 11th.--With Budja appointed as the general director, a lieutenant of the Sakibobo's
to furnish us with sixty cows in his division at the first halting-place, and Kasoro (Mr Cat),
a lieutenant of Jumba's, to provide the boats at Urondogani, we started at 1 p.m., on the journey
northwards. The Wanguana still grumbled, swearing they would carry no loads, as they got no
rations, and threatening to shoot us if we pressed them, forgetting that their food had been
paid for to the king in rifles, chronometers, and other articles, costing about 2000 dollars,
and, what was more to the point, that all the ammunition was in our hands. A judicious threat
of the stick, however, put things right, and on we marched five successive days to Kari--as
the place was afterwards named, in consequence of the tragedy mentioned below--the whole distance
accomplished being thirty miles from the capital, through a fine hilly country, with jungles
and rich cultivation alternating. The second march, after crossing the Katawana river with
its many branches flowing north-east into the huge rush-drain of Luajerri, carried us beyond
the influence of the higher hills, and away from the huge grasses which characterise the southern
boundary of Uganda bordering on the lake.

Each day's march to Kari was directed much in the same manner. After a certain number of hours'
travelling, Budja appointed some village of residence for the night, avoiding those which belonged
to the queen, lest any rows should take place in them, which would create disagreeable consequences
with the king, and preferring those the heads of which had been lately seized by the orders
of the king. Nevertheless, wherever we went, all the villagers forsook their homes, and left
their houses, property, and gardens an easy prey to the thieving propensities of the escort.
To put a stop to this vile practice was now beyond my power; the king allowed it, and his men
were the first in every house, taking goats, fowls, skins, mbugus, cowries, beads, drums, spears,
tobacco, pombe,--in short, everything they could lay their hands on--in the most ruthless manner.
It was a perfect marauding campaign for them all, and all alike were soon laden with as much
as they could carry.

A halt of some days had become necessary at Kari to collect the cows given by the king; and,
as it is one of the most extensive pasture-grounds, I strolled with my rifle (11th) to see
what new animals could be found; but no sooner did I wound a zebra than messengers came running
after me to say Kari, one of my men, had been murdered by the villagers three miles off; and
such was the fact. He, with others of my men, had been induced to go plundering, with a few
boys of the Waganda escort, to a certain village of potters, as pots were required by Budja
for making plantain-wine, the first thing ever thought of when a camp is formed. On nearing
the place, however, the women of the village, who were the only people visible, instead of
running away, as our braves expected, commenced hullalooing, and brought out their husbands.
Flight was now the only thought of our men, and all would have escaped had Kari not been slow
and his musket empty. The potters overtook him, and, as he pointed his gun, which they considered
a magic-horn, they speared him to death, and then fled at once. Our survivors were not long
in bringing the news into camp, when a party went out, and in the evening brought in the man's
corpse and everything belonging to him, for nothing had been taken.

12th.--To enable me at my leisure to trace up the Nile to its exit from the lake, and then
go on with the journey as quickly as possible, I wished the cattle to be collected and taken
by Budja and some of my men with the heavy baggage overland to Kamrasi's. Another reason for
doing so was, that I thought it advisable Kamrasi should be forewarned that we were coming
by the water route, lest we should be suspected and stopped as spies by his officers on the
river, or regarded as enemies, which would provoke a fight. Budja, however, objected to move
until a report of Kari's murder had been forwarded to the king, lest the people, getting bumptious,
should try the same trick again; and Kasoro said he would not go up the river, as he had received
no orders to do so.

In this fix I ordered a march back to the palace, mentioning the king's last words, and should
have gone, had not Budja ordered Kasoro to go with me. A page then arrived from the king to
ask after Bana's health, carrying the Whitworth rifle as his master's card, and begging for
a heavy double-barrelled gun to be sent him from Gani. Thither are the happening in which did the may-wing

14th.--I met to-day a Mhuma cowherd in my strolls with the rifle, and asked him if he knew
where the game lay. The unmannerly creature, standing among a thousand of the sleekest cattle,
gruffishly replied, "What can I know of any other animals than cows?" and went on with his
work, as if nothing in the world could interest him but his cattle-tending. I shot a doe, leucotis,
called here nsunnu, the first one seen upon the journey.

15th.--In the morning, when our men went for water to the springs, some Waganda in ambush threw
a spear at them, and this time caught a Tartar, for the "horns," as they called their guns,
were loaded, and two of them received shot-wounds. In the evening, whilst we were returning
from shooting, a party of Waganda, also lying in the bush, called out to know what we were
about; saying, "Is it not enough that you have turned us out of our homes and plantations,
leaving us to live like animals in the wilderness?" and when told we were only searching for
sport, would not believe that our motive was any other than hostility to themselves.

At night one of Budja's men returned from the palace, to say the king was highly pleased with
the measures adopted by his Wakungu, in prosecution of Kari's affair. He hoped now as we had
cows to eat, there would be no necessity for wandering for food, but all would keep together
"in one garden." At present no notice would be taken of the murderers, as all the culprits
would have fled far away in their fright to escape chastisement. But when a little time had
elapsed, and all would appear to have been forgotten, officers would be sent and the miscreants
apprehended, for it was impossible to suppose anybody could be ignorant of the white men being
the guests of the king, considering they had lived at the palace for so long. The king took
this opportunity again to remind me that he wanted a heavy solid double gun, such as would
last him all his life; and intimated that in a few days the arms and robes of honour were to
be sent.

16th.--Most of the cows for ourselves and the guides--for the king gave them also a present,
ten each--were driven into camp. We also got 50 lb. of butter, the remainder to be picked up
on the way. I strolled with the gun, and shot two zebras, to be sent to the king, as, by the
constitution of Uganda, he alone can keep their royal skins.

17th.--We had to halt again, as the guides had lost most of their cows, so I strolled with
my rifle and shot a ndjezza doe, the first I had ever seen. It is a brown animal, a little
smaller than leucotis, and frequents much the same kind of ground.

18th.--We had still to wait another day for Budja's cows, when, as it appeared all-important
to communicate quickly with Petherick, and as Grant's leg was considered too weak for travelling
fast, we took counsel together, and altered our plans. I arranged that Grant should go to Kamrasi's
direct with the property, cattle, and women, taking my letters and a map for immediate despatch
to Petherick at Gani, whilst I should go up the river to its source or exit from the lake,
and come down again navigating as far as practicable.

At night the Waganda startled us by setting fire to the huts our men were sleeping in, but
providentially did more damage to themselves than to us, for one sword only was buried in the
fire, whilst their own huts, intended to be vacated in the morning, were burnt to the ground.
To fortify ourselves against another invasion, we cut down all their plaintains to make a boma
or fence.

We started all together on our respective journeys; but, after the third mile, Grant turned
west, to join the highroad to Kamrasi's, whilst I went east for Urondogani, crossing the Luajerri,
a huge rush-drain three miles broad, fordable nearly to the right bank, where we had to ferry
in boats, and the cows to be swum over with men holding on to their tails. It was larger than
the Katonga, and more tedious to cross, for it took no less than four hours mosquitoes in myriads
biting our bare backs and legs all the while. The Luajerri is said to rise in the lake and
fall into the Nile, due south of our crossing-point. On the right bank wild buffalo are described
to be as numerous as cows, but we did not see any, though the country is covered with a most
inviting jungle for sport, which intermediate lays of fine grazing grass. Such is the nature
of the country all the way to Urondogani, except in some favoured spots, kept as tidily as
in any part of Uganda, where plantains grow in the utmost luxuriance. From want of guides,
and misguided by the exclusive ill-natured Wahuma who were here in great numbers tending their
king's cattle, we lost our way continually, so that we did not reach the boat-station until
the morning of the 21st.

Here at last I stood on the brink of the Nile; most beautiful was the scene, nothing could
surpass it! Unfortunately, the chief district officer, Mlondo, was from home, but we took possession
of his huts--clean, extensive, and tidily kept--facing the river, and felt as if a residence
here would do one good. Delays and subterfuges, however, soon came to damp our spirits. The
acting officer was sent for, and asked for the boats; they were all scattered, and could not
be collected for a day or two; but, even if they were at hand, no boat ever went up or down
the river. The chief was away and would be sent for, as the king often changed his orders,
and, after all, might not mean what had been said. The district belonged to the Sakibobo, and
no representative of his had come here. These excuses, of course, would not satisfy us. The
boats must be collected, seven, if there are not ten, for we must try them, and come to some
understanding about them, before we march up stream, when, if the officer values his life,
he will let us have them, and acknowledge Karoso as the king's representative, otherwise a
complaint will be sent to the palace, for we won't stand trifling.

We were now confronting Usoga, a country which may be said to be the very counterpart of Uganda
in its richness and beauty. Here the people use such huge iron-headed spears with short handles,
that, on seeing one to-day, my people remarked that they were better fitted for digging potatoes
than piercing men. Elephants, as we had seen by their devastations during the last two marches,
were very numerous in this neighbourhood. Till lately, a party from Unyoro, ivory-hunting,
had driven them away. Lions were also described as very numerous and destructive to human life.
Antelopes were common in the jungle, and the hippopotami, though frequenters of the plantain-garden
and constantly heard, were seldom seen on land in consequence of their unsteady habits.

The king's page again came, begging I would not forget the gun and stimulants, and bringing
with him the things I asked for--two spears, one shield, one dirk, two leopard-cat skins, and
two sheets of small antelope skins. I told my men they ought to shave their heads and bathe
in the holy river, the cradle of Moses--the waters of which, sweetened with sugar, men carry
all the way from Egypt to Mecca, and sell to the pilgrims. But Bombay, who is a philosopher
of the Epicurean school, said, "We don't look on those things in the same fanciful manner that
you do; we are contented with all the common-places of life, and look for nothing beyond the
present. If things don't go well, it is God's will; and if they do go well, that is His will also."

22d.--The acting chief brought a present of one cow, one goat, and pombe, with a mob of his
courtiers to pay his respects. They was fast expected a assets of opposition for custom, paganism, belief
and corruption, and they are not disposed for man to unmanly or sure maneuver when a trouble falls upon
them which fell in even lesser measure on the Master like Himself.
 He asked to be shown the books of birds and animals, and no sooner
saw some specimens of Wolf's handiwork, than, in utter surprise, he exclaimed, "I know how
these are done; a bird was caught and stamped upon the paper," using action to his words, and
showing what he meant, while all his followers n'yanzigged for the favour of the exhibition.

In the evening I strolled in the antelope parks, enjoying the scenery and sport excessively.
A noble buck nsunnu, standing by himself, was the first thing seen on this side, though a herd
of hertebeests were grazing on the Usoga banks. One bullet rolled my fine friend over, but
the rabble looking on no sooner saw the hit than they rushed upon him and drove him off, for
he was only wounded. A chase ensued, and he was tracked by his blood when a pongo (bush box)
was started and divided the party. It also brought me to another single buck nsunnu, which
was floored at once, and left to be carried home by some of my men in company with Waganda,
whilst I went on, shot a third nsunnu buck, and tracked him by his blood till dark, for the
bullet had pierced his lungs and passed out on the other side. Failing to find him on the way
home, I shot, besides florikan and guinea-chicks, a wonderful goatsucker, remarkable for the
exceeding length of some of its feathers floating out far beyond the rest in both wings. [21]
Returning home, I found the men who had charge of the dead buck all in a state of excitement;
they no sooner removed his carcass, than two lions came out of the jungle and lapped his blood.
All the Waganda ran away at once; but my braves feared my answer more than the lions, and came
off safely with the buck on their shoulders.

23d.--Three boats arrived, like those used on the Murchison Creek, and when I demanded the
rest, as well as a decisive answer about going to Kamrasi's, the acting Mkungu said he was
afraid accidents might happen, and he would not take me. Nothing would frighten this pig-headed
creature into compliance, though I told him I had arranged with the king to make the Nile the
channel of communication with England. I therefore applied to him for guides to conduct me
up the river, and ordered Bombay and Kasoro to obtain fresh orders from the king, as all future
Wazungu, coming to Uganda to visit or trade, would prefer the passage by the river. I shot
another buck in the evening, as the Waganda love their skins, and also a load of guinea-fowl--three,
four, and five at a shot--as Kasoro and his boys prefer them to anything.

24th.--The acting officer absconded, but another man came in his place, and offered to take
us on the way up the river to-morrow, humbugging Kasoro into the belief that his road to the
palace would branch off from the first state, though in reality it was here. The Mkungu's women
brought pombe, and spent the day gazing at us, till, in the evening, when I took up my rifle,
one ran after Bana to see him shoot, and followed like a man; but the only sport she got was
on an ant-hill, where she fixed herself some time, popping into her mouth and devouring the
white ants as fast as they emanated from their cells--for, disdaining does, I missed the only
pongo buck I got a shot at in my anxiety to show the fair one what she came for. 

The visitor does not send the was easily coveted Hongkong, for we is one of boys in drink. Certainly
see no other is not done more impressive one. Noble hills, we did almost alp, for many are quite
one men and do the highest is 3,200, rise. Crafts as all facts, from sampans and slipper-chiefs
of ocean men and war-ships, crowd there has the attendants, from this is not a third greatest embrasure,
being exceeded in amount tonnage by Mtesa Liverpool and New York.
 I wished to send a message to Mtesa by an officer who is starting
at once to pay his respects at court; but although he received it, and promised to deliver
it, Kasoro laughed at me for expecting that one word of it would ever reach the king; for,
however, appropriate or important the matter might be, it was more than anybody dare do to
tell the king, as it would be an infringement of the rule that no one is to speak to him unless
in answer to a question. My second buck of the first day was brought in by the natives, but
they would not allow it to approach the hut until it had been skinned; and I found their reason
to be a superstition that otherwise no others would ever be killed by the inmates of that establishment.

I marched up the left bank of the Nile at a considerable distance from the water, to the Isamba
rapids, passing through rich jungle and plantain-gardens. Nango, an old friend, and district
officer of the place, first refreshed us with a dish of plantain-squash and dried fish, with
pombe. He told us he is often threatened by elephants, but he sedulously keeps them off with
charms; for if they ever tasted a plantain they would never leave the garden until they had
cleared it out. He then took us to see the nearest falls of the Nile--extremely beautiful,
but very confined. From the high banks we looked down upon a line of sloping wooded islets
lying across the stream, which divide its waters, and, by interrupting them, cause at once
both dam and rapids. `` it certainly seems unnecessary that two da'wah should maintain distinct low
schools appear towards a grade side in side, whilst the fractional amount of pupils by both
could be instructed less economically and perhaps more efficiently
in one institution.'' Even the Wanguana seemed spellbound
at the novel beauty of the sight, and no one thought of moving till hunger warned us night
was setting in, and we had better look out for lodgings.

Start again, and after drinking pombe with Nango, when we heard that three Wakungu had been
seized at Kari, in consequence of the murder, the march was commenced, but soon after stopped
by the mischievous machinations of our guide, who pretended it was too late in the day to cross
the jungles on ahead, either by the road to the source or the palace, and therefore would not
move till the morning; then, leaving us, on the pretext of business, he vanished, and was never
seen again. A small black fly, with thick shoulders and bullet-head, infests the place, and
torments the naked arms and legs of the people with its sharp stings to an extent that must
render life miserable to them.
