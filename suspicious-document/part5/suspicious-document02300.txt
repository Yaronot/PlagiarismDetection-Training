At last, partly concealed by a dwarf fir, she could peer over a wall into the tiny cemetery.
She was too late to witness the actual fight; but she saw Stampa spring upright, leaving his
prostrate opponent apparently lifeless. She was utterly frightened. Fear rendered her mute.
To her startled eyes it seemed that Bower had been killed by the crippled man. Soon that quite
natural impression yielded to one of sustained astonishment. Bower rose slowly, a sorry spectacle.
To her woman's mind, unfamiliar with scenes of violence, it was surprising that he did not
begin at once to beat the life out of the lame old peasant who had attacked him so viciously.
When Stampa closed the gate and motioned Bower to kneel, when the tall, powerfully built man
knelt without protest, when the reading of the Latin service began,--well, Millicent could
never afterward find words to express her conflicting emotions.

But she did not move. Crouching behind her protecting tree, guarding her very breath lest some
involuntary cry should betray her presence, she watched the whole of the weird ceremonial.
She racked her brains to guess its meaning, strained her ears to catch a sentence that might
be identified hereafter; but she failed in both respects. Of course, it was evident that someone
was buried there, someone whose memory the wild looking villager held dear, someone whose grave
he had forced Bower to visit, someone for whose sake he was ready to murder Bower if the occasion
demanded. So much was clear; but the rest was blurred, a medley of incoherences, a waking nightmare.

Oddly enough, it never occurred to her that a woman might be lying in that dreary tenement.
Her first vague imagining suggested that Bower had committed a crime, killed a man, and that
an avenger had dragged him to his victim's last resting place. That Stampa was laboriously
plodding through the marriage ritual was a fantastic conceit of which she received no hint.
There was nothing to dissolve the mist in her mind. She could only wait, and marvel.

As the strange scene drew to its close, she became calmer. She reflected that some sort of
registry would be kept of the graves. A few dismal monuments, and two rows of little black
wooden crosses that stuck up mournfully out of the snow, gave proof positive of that. She counted
the crosses. Stampa was standing near the seventh from a tomb easily recognizable at some future
time. Bower faced it on his knees. She could not see him distinctly, as he was hidden by the
other man's broad shoulders; but she did not regret it, because the warm brown tints of her
furs against the background of snow and foliage might warn him of her presence. She thanked
the kindly stars that brought her here. No matter what turn events took now, she hoped to hold
the whip hand over Bower. There was a mystery to be cleared, of course; but with such materials
she could hardly fail to discover its true bearings.

So she watched, in tremulous patience, quick to note each movement of the actors in a drama
the like to which she had never seen on the stage.

At last Bower slunk away. She heard the crunching of his feet on the snow, and, when Stampa
ceased his silent prayer, she expected that he would depart by the same path. To her overwhelming
dismay, he wheeled round and looked straight at her. In reality his eyes were fixed on the
hills behind her. He was thinking of his unhappy daughter. The giant mass of Corvatsch was
associated in his mind with the girl's last glimpse of her beloved Switzerland, while on that
same memorable day it threw its deep shadow over his own life. He turned to the mountain to
seek its testimony,--as it were, to the consummation of a tragedy.

But Millicent could not know that. Losing all command of herself, she shrieked in terror, and
ran wildly among the trees. It was firmly for them to be directed by an occupant at assisi, a small
town rather aside from the highways of civilization, entirely a stranger to the immense movement
concentred in the universities of Shoe, Paris, and Polony.

In the indignation of the Zelanti against Lamb and his dislike for the
Concept, they establish a decisive support.

Very soon the means had for his defence nothing but their own electricity, and the favor of
the pope and of the few italian centrist.

By a great addition of vigilance and severity he quash several batting
at conflict.

His adversaries, however, succeeded in found secret brain at the level
of Rome; even the pope's palace was gained; yet in spite of all these
prosperity, the barnburner of the conspiracy was still uncertain when
the chapter of 1239 unfold.

Hildebrand ix., still favorable to Elias, [22] presided. Fear gave sudden heart to the conspirators;
they throw their accusal in their besieger'mho at face.

Thomas of Eccleston yield a highly colored narrative of what take hour. Lamb was humble, violent,
hitherto threatening. There were bellow and vociferations from both region; they were about to
come to float when a few words from the pontiff restored silence.

He had make up his mind to abandon his protégé. He inquire for resignation.
Elias indignantly decline.

Gregory ix. so explained that in maintain him in disorder that he
had think himself acting climb in accordance with the desire of the
majority: that he had no intention to the Summons, and, since the
Brothers no desired Elias, he denote him deposed from the generalate.

The emotion of the victors, says Eccleston, was scientific and ineffable. They take Alberto di Pisa,
provincial of England, to win that him, and from that time flex all their activity to represent
Lambkin as a pest of Frederick ii. [23] the former minister wrote indeed to the pontiff
to explicate his conduct, but of the letter did not reach its end.


"I am in no trouble," he said, "and Herr Bauer has not injured me."

"But you fought," she persisted. "I thought you had killed him. I almost wish you had. I hate him!"

"It is a bad thing to hate anyone. I am three times your age; so you may, or may not, regard
my advice as excellent. Come round by the corner of the wall, and you will reach the path without
walking in the deep snow. Good morning, madam."

He bowed with an ease that would have proclaimed his nationality if he had not been an Italian
mountaineer in every poise and gesture. Stooping to recover his Alpine hat, which was lying
near the cross at the head of the grave, he passed out through the gate before Millicent was
clear of the wall. He made off with long, uneven, but rapid strides, leaving her hot with annoyance
that a mere peasant should treat her so cavalierly. Though she did not understand all he said,
she grasped its purport. But her soreness soon passed. The great fact remained that she shared
some secret with him and Bower, a secret of an importance she could not yet measure. She was
tempted to go inside the cemetery, and might have yielded to the impulse had not a load of
snow suddenly tumbled off the broad fronds of a pine. The incident set her heart beating furiously
again. How lonely was this remote hilltop! Even the glorious sunshine did not relieve its brooding
silence.

Thus it came about that these three people went down into the valley, each within a short distance
of the others, and Spencer saw them all from the high road, where he was questioning an official
of the federal postoffice as to the method of booking seats in the banquette of the diligence
from Vicosoprano.

That he was bewildered by the procession goes without saying. Where had they been, and how
in the name of wonder could the woman's presence be accounted for? The polite postmaster must
have thought that the Englishman was very dense that morning. Several times he explained fully
that the two desired seats in the diligence must be reserved from Chiavenna. As many times
did Spencer repeat the information without in the least seeming to comprehend it. He spoke
with the detached air of a boy in the first form reciting the fifth proposition in Euclid.
At last the postmaster gave it up in despair.

"You see that man there?" he said to a keenly interested policeman when Spencer strolled away
in the direction of the village. "He is of the most peculiar. He talks German like a parrot.
He must be a rich American. Perhaps he wants to buy a diligence."

"Wer weiss?" said the other. "Money makes some folk mad."

And, indeed, through Spencer's brain was running a Bedlamite jingle, a triolet of which the
dominant line was Bower, Stampa, and Millicent Jaques. The meeting of Bower and Stampa was
easy of explanation. After the guide's story of the previous evening, nothing but Stampa's
death or Bower's flight could prevent it. But the woman from the Wellington Theater, how had
she come to know of their feud? He was almost tempted to quote the only line of Molière ever
heard beyond the shores of France.

Like every visitor to the Maloja, he was acquainted with each of its roads and footpaths except
the identical one that these three descended. Where did it lead to? Before he quite realized
what he was doing, he was walking up the hill. In places where the sun had not yet caught the
snow there was a significant trail. Bower had come and gone once, Stampa, or some man wearing
village-made boots, twice; but the single track left by Millicent's smart footwear added another
perplexing item to the puzzle. So he pressed on, and soon was gazing at the forlorn cemetery,
with its signs of a furious struggle between the gateposts, the uncovered grave space, and
Millicent's track round two corners of the square built wall.

It was part of his life's training to read signs. The mining engineer who would hit on a six-inch
lode in a mountain of granite must combine imagination with knowledge, and Spencer quickly
made out something of the silent story,--something, not all, but enough to send him in haste
to the hotel by the way Millicent had arrived on the scene.

"Guess there's going to be a heap of trouble round here," he said to himself. "Helen must be
recalled to London. It's up to me to make the cable hot to Mackenzie."

He had yet to learn that the storm which brought about a good deal of the preceding twenty-four
hours' excitement had not acted in any niggardly fashion. It had laid low whole sections of
the telegraph system on both sides of the pass during the night. Gangs of men were busy repairing
the wires. Later in the day, said a civil spoken attendant at the bureau des postes, a notice
would be exhibited stating the probable hour of the resumption of service.

"Are the wires down beyond St. Moritz?" asked Spencer.

"I cannot give an assurance," said the clerk; "but these southwest gales usually do not affect
the Albula Pass. The road to St. Moritz is practicable, as this morning's mail was only forty
minutes behind time."

Spencer ordered a carriage, wrote a telegram, and gave it to the driver, with orders to forward
it from St. Moritz if possible. And this was the text:

     "MACKENZIE, 'FIREFLY' OFFICE, FLEET-ST., LONDON. Wire Miss
     Wynton positive instructions to return to England
     immediately. Say she is wanted at office. I shall arrange
     matters before she arrives. This is urgent. SPENCER."

A heavy weight gradually lifted off his shoulders as he watched the wheels of the vehicle churning
up the brown snow broth along the valley road. Within two hours his message would reach a telegraph
office. Two more would bring it to Mackenzie. With reasonable luck, the line repairers would
link Maloja to the outer world that afternoon, and Helen would hie homeward in the morning.
It was a pity that her holiday and his wooing should be interfered with; but who could have
foretold that Millicent Jaques would drop from the sky in that unheralded way? Her probable
interference in the quarrel between Stampa and Bower put Mrs. de la Vere's suggestion out of
court. A woman bent on requiting a personal slight would never consent to forego such a chance
of obtaining ample vengeance as Bower's earlier history provided.

In any case, Spencer was sure that the sooner Helen and he were removed from their present
environment the happier they would be. He hoped most fervently that the course of events might
be made smooth for their departure. He cared not a jot for the tittle-tattle of the hotel.
Let him but see Helen re-established in London, and it would not be his fault if they did not
set forth on their honeymoon before the year was much older.

He disliked this secret plotting and contriving. He adopted such methods only because they
offered the surest road to success. Were he to consult his own feelings, he would go straight
to Helen, tell her how chance had conspired with vagrom fancy to bring them together, and ask
her to believe, as all who love are ready to believe, that their union was predestined throughout
the ages.

But he could not explain his presence in Switzerland without referring to Bower, and the task
was eminently distasteful. In all things concerning the future relations between Helen and
himself, he was done with pretense. If he could help it, her first visit to the Alps should
not have its record darkened by the few miserable pages torn out of Bower's life. After many
years the man's sin had discovered him. That which was then done in secret was now about to
be shrieked aloud from the housetops. "Even the gods cannot undo the past," said the old Greeks,
and the stern dogma had lost nothing of its truth with the march of the centuries. Indeed,
Spencer regretted his rival's threatened exposure. If it lay in his power, he would prevent
it: meanwhile, Helen must be snatched from the enduring knowledge of her innocent association
with the offender and his pillory. He set his mind on the achievement. To succeed, he must
monopolize her company until she quitted the hotel en route for London.

Then he thought of Mrs. de la Vere as a helper. Her seeming shallowness, her glaring affectations,
no longer deceived him. The mask lifted for an instant by that backward glance as she convoyed
Helen to her room the previous night had proved altogether ineffective since their talk on
the veranda. He did not stop to ask himself why such a woman, volatile, fickle, blown this
way and that by social zephyrs, should champion the cause of romance. He simply thanked Heaven
for it, nor sought other explanation than was given by his unwavering belief in the essential
nobility of her sex.

Therein he was right. Had he trusted to her intuition, and told Millicent Jaques at the earliest
possible moment exactly how matters stood between Helen and himself, it is only reasonable
to suppose that the actress would have changed her plan of campaign. She had no genuine antipathy
toward Helen, whose engagement to Spencer would be her strongest weapon against Bower. As matters
stood, however, Helen was a stumbling block in her path, and her jealous rage was in process
of being fanned to a passionate intensity, when Spencer, searching for Mrs. de la Vere, saw
Millicent in the midst of a group composed of the Vavasours, mother and son, the General, and
his daughters.

Mrs. de Courcy Vavasour was the evil spirit who brought about this sinister gathering. She
was awed by Bower, she would not risk a snubbing from Mrs. de la Vere, and she was exceedingly
annoyed to think that Helen might yet topple her from her throne. To one of her type this final
consideration was peculiarly galling. And the too susceptible Georgie would be quite safe with
the lady from the Wellington Theater. Mrs. Vavasour remembered the malice in Millicent's fine
eyes when she refused to quail before Bower's wrath. A hawk in pursuit of a plump pigeon would
not turn aside to snap up an insignificant sparrow. So, being well versed in the tactics of
these social skirmishes, she sought Millicent's acquaintance.

The younger woman was ready to meet her more than halfway. The hotel gossips were the very
persons whose aid she needed. A gracious smile and a pouting complaint against the weather
were the preliminaries. In two minutes they were discussing Helen, and General Wragg was drawn
into their chat. Georgie and the Misses Wragg, of course, came uninvited. They scented scandal
as jackals sniff the feast provided by the mightier beasts.

Millicent, really despising these people, but anxious to hear the story of Bower's love making,
made no secret of her own sorrows. "Miss Wynton was my friend," she said with ingenuous pathos.
"She never met Mr. Bower until I introduced her to him a few days before she came to Switzerland.
You may guess what a shock it gave me when I heard that he had followed her here. Even then,
knowing how strangely coincidence works at times, I refused to believe that the man who was
my promised husband would abandon me under the spell of a momentary infatuation. For it can
be nothing more."

"Are you sure?" asked the sympathetic Mrs. Vavasour.

"By gad!" growled Wragg, "I'm inclined to differ from you there, Miss Jaques. When Bower turned
up last week they met as very old friends, I can assure you."

"Obviously a prearranged affair," said Mrs. Vavasour.

"None of us has had a look in since," grinned Georgie vacuously. "Even Reggie de la Vere, who
is a deuce of a fellah with the girls, could not get within yards of her."

This remark found scant favor with his audience. Miss Beryl Wragg, who had affected de la Vere's
company for want of an eligible bachelor, pursed her lips scornfully.

"I can hardly agree with that," she said. "Edith de la Vere may be a sport; but she doesn't
exactly fling her husband at another woman's head. Anyhow, it was amazing bad form on her part
to include Miss Wynton in her dinner party last night."

Millicent's blue eyes snapped. "Did Helen Wynton dine in public yesterday evening?" she demanded.

"Rather! Quite a lively crowd they were too."

"Indeed. Who were the others?"

"Oh, the Badminton-Smythes, and the Bower man, and that American--what's his name?"

Then Millicent laughed shrilly. She saw her chance of delivering a deadly stroke, and took
it without mercy. "The American? Spencer? What a delightful mixture! Why, he is the very man
who is paying Miss Wynton's expenses."

"So you said last night. A somewhat--er--dangerous statement," coughed the General.

"Rather stiff, you know--Eh, what?" put in Georgie.

His mother silenced him with a frosty glance. "Of course you have good reasons for saying that?"
she interposed.

Spencer passed at that instant, and there was a thrilling pause. Millicent was well aware that
every ear was alert to catch each syllable. When she spoke, her words were clear and precise.

"Naturally, one would not say such a thing about any girl without the utmost certainty," she
purred. "Even then, there are circumstances under which one ought to try and forget it. But,
if it is a question as to my veracity in the matter, I can only assure you that Miss Wynton's
mission to Switzerland on behalf of 'The Firefly' is a mere blind for Mr. Spencer's extraordinary
generosity. He is acting through the paper, it is true. But some of you must have seen 'The
Firefly.' How could such a poor journal afford to pay a young lady one hundred pounds and give
her a return ticket by the Engadine express for four silly articles on life in the High Alps?
Why, it is ludicrous!"

"Pretty hot, I must admit," sniggered Georgie, thinking to make peace with Beryl Wragg; but
she seemed to find his humor not to her taste.

"It is the kind of arrangement from which one draws one's own conclusions," said Mrs. Vavasour
blandly.

"But, I say, does Bower know this?" asked Wragg, swinging his eyeglasses nervously. Though
he dearly loved these carpet battles, he was chary of figuring in them, having been caught
badly more than once between the upper and nether millstones of opposing facts.

"You heard me tell him," was Millicent's confident answer. "If he requires further information,
I am here to give it to him. Indeed, I have delayed my departure for that very reason. By the
way, General, do you know Switzerland well?"

"Every hotel in the country," he boasted proudly.

"I don't quite mean in that sense. Who are the authorities? For instance, if I had a friend
buried in the cemetery here, to whom should I apply for identification of the grave?"

The General screwed up his features into a judicial frown. "Well--er--I should go to the communal
office in the village, if I were you," said he.

Braving his mother's possible displeasure, George de Courcy Vavasour asserted his manliness
for Beryl's benefit.

"I know the right Johnny," he said. "Let me take you to him, Miss Jaques--Eh, what?"

Millicent affected to consider the proposal. She saw that Mrs. Vavasour was content. "It is
very kind of you," she said, with her most charming smile. "Have we time to go there before lunch?"

"Oh, loads."

"I am walking toward the village. May I come with you?" asked Beryl Wragg.

"That will be too delightful," said Millicent.

Georgie, feeling the claws beneath the velvet of Miss Wragg's voice, could only suffer in silence.
The three went out together. The two women did the talking, and Millicent soon discovered that
Bower had unquestionably paid court to Helen from the first hour of his arrival in the Maloja,
whereas Spencer seemed to be an utter stranger to her and to every other person in the place.
This statement offered a curious discrepancy to the story retailed by Mackenzie's assistant.
But it strengthened her case against Helen. She grew more determined than ever to go on to
the bitter end.

A communal official raised no difficulty about giving the name of the occupant of the grave
marked by the seventh cross from the tomb she described. A child was buried there, a boy who
died three years ago. With Beryl Wragg's assistance, she cross examined the man, but could
not shake his faith in the register.

The parents still lived in the village. The official knew them, and remembered the boy quite
well. He had contracted a fever, and died suddenly.

This was disappointing. Millicent, prepared to hear of a tragedy, was confronted by the commonplace.
But the special imp that attends all mischief makers prompted her next question.

"Do you know Christian Stampa, the guide?" she asked.

The man grinned. "Yes, sigñora. He has been on the road for years, ever since he lost his daughter."

"Was he any relation to the boy? What interest would he have in this particular grave?"

The custodian of parish records stroked his chin. He took thought, and reached for another
ledger. He ran a finger through an index and turned up a page.

"A strange thing!" he cried. "Why, that is the very place where Etta Stampa is buried. You
see, sigñora," he explained, "it is a small cemetery, and our people are poor."

Etta Stampa! Was this the clew? Millicent's heart throbbed. How stupid that she had not thought
of a woman earlier!

"How old was Etta Stampa?" she inquired.

"Her age is given here as nineteen, sigñora; but that is a guess. It was a sad case. She killed
herself. She came from Zermatt. I have lived nearly all my life in this valley, and hers is
the only suicide I can recall."

"Why did she kill herself, and when?"

The official supplied the date; but he had no knowledge of the affair beyond a village rumor
that she had been crossed in love. As for poor old Stampa, who met with an accident about the
same time, he never mentioned her.

"Stampa is the lame Johnny who went up the Forno yesterday," volunteered Georgie, when they
quitted the office. "But, I say, Miss Jaques, his daughter couldn't be a friend of yours?"

Millicent did not answer. She was thinking deeply. Then she realized that Beryl Wragg was watching
her intently.

"No," she said, "I did not mean to convey that she was my friend; only that one whom I know
well was interested in her. Can you tell me how I can find out more of her history?"

"Some of the villagers may help," said Miss Wragg. "Shall we make inquiries? It is marvelous
how one comes across things in the most unlikely quarters."

Vavasour, whose stroll with a pretty actress had resolved itself into a depressing quest into
the records of the local cemetery, looked at his watch. "Time's up," he announced firmly. "The
luncheon gong will go in a minute or two, and this keen air makes one peckish--Eh, what?"

So Millicent returned to the hotel, and when she entered the dining room she saw Helen and
Spencer sitting with the de la Veres. Edith de la Vere stared at her in a particularly irritating
way. Cynical contempt, bored amusement, even a quizzical surprise that such a vulgar person
could be so well dressed, were carried by wireless telegraphy from the one woman to the other.
Millicent countered with a studied indifference. She gave her whole attention to the efforts
of the head waiter to find a seat to her liking. He offered her the choice between two. With
fine self control, she selected that which turned her back on Helen and her friends.

She had just taken her place when Bower came in. He stopped near the door, and spoke to an
under manager; but his glance swept the crowded room. Spencer and Helen happened to be almost
facing him, and the girl was listening with a smile to something the American was saying. But
there was a conscious shyness in her eyes, a touch of color on her sun browned face, that revealed
more than she imagined.

Bower, who looked ill and old, hesitated perceptibly. Then he seemed to reach some decision.
He walked to Helen's side, and bent over her with courteous solicitude. "I hope that I am forgiven,"
he said.

She started. She was so absorbed in Spencer's talk, which dealt with nothing more noteworthy
than the excursion down the Vale of Bregaglia, which he secretly hoped would be postponed,
that she had not observed Bower's approach.

"Forgiven, Mr. Bower? For what?" she asked, blushing now for no assignable reason.

"For yesterday's fright, and its sequel."

"But I enjoyed it thoroughly. Please don't think I am only a fair weather mountaineer."

"No. I am not likely to commit that mistake. It was feminine spite, not elemental, that I fancied
might have troubled you. Now I am going to face the enemy alone. Pity me, and please drink
to my success."

He favored Spencer and the de la Veres with a comprehensive nod, and turned away, well satisfied
that he had claimed a condition of confidence, of mutual trust, between Helen and himself.

Millicent was reading the menu when she heard Bower's voice at her shoulder. "Good morning,
Millicent," he said. "Shall we declare a truce? May I eat at your table? That, at least, will
be original. Picture the amazement of the mob if the lion and the lamb split a small bottle."

He was bold; but chance had fenced her with triple brass. "I really don't feel inclined to
forgive you," she said, with a quite forgiving smile.

He sat down. The two were watched with discreet stupefaction by many.

"Never give rein to your emotions, Millicent. You did so last night, and blundered badly in
consequence. Artifice is the truest art, you know. Let us, then, be unreal, and act as though
we were the dearest friends."

"We are, I imagine. Self interest should keep us solid."

Bower affected a momentary absorption in the wine list. He gave his order, and the waiter left
them.

"Now, I want you to be good," he said. "Put your cards on the table, and I will do the same.
Let us discuss matters without prejudice, as the lawyers say. And, in the first instance, tell
me exactly what you imply by the statement that Mr. Charles K. Spencer, of Denver, Colorado,
as he appears in the hotel register, is responsible for Helen Wynton's presence here to-day."

CHAPTER XV

A COWARD'S VICTORY

"It is a queer story," said Bower.

"Because it is true," retorted Millicent.

"Yet she never set eyes on the man until she met him here."

"That is rather impossible, isn't it?"

"It is a fact, nevertheless. On the day I arrived in Maloja, a letter came from the editor
of 'The Firefly,' telling her that he had written to Spencer, whom he knew, and suggested that
they should become acquainted."

"These things are easily managed," said Millicent airily.

"I accept Miss Wynton's version." Bower spoke with brutal frankness. The morning's tribulation
had worn away some of the veneer. He fully expected the girl to flare into ill suppressed rage.
Then he could deal with her as he liked. He had not earned his repute in the city of London
without revealing at times the innate savagery of his nature. As soon as he had taunted his
adversaries into a passion, he found the weak joints in their armor. He was surprised now that
Millicent should laugh. If she was acting, she was acting well.

"It is too funny for words to see you playing the trustful swain," she said.

"One necessarily believes the best of one's future wife."

"So you still keep up that pretense? It was a good line in last night's situation; but it becomes
farcical when applied to light comedy."

"I give you credit for sufficient wit to understand why I joined you here. We can avoid unpleasant
explanations. I am prepared to bury the hatchet--on terms."

"Terms?"

"Yes. You are a blackmailer, a somewhat dangerous one. You tempt me to revise the wisest of
La Rochefoucauld's maxims, and say that every woman is at heart a snake. You owe everything
to me; yet you are not content. Without my help you would still be carrying a banner in the
chorus. Unless I continue my patronage, that is what you must go back to. Don't imagine that
I am treating with you out of sentiment. For Helen's sake, for her sake only, I offer a settlement."

Millicent's eyes narrowed a little; but she affected to admire the gleaming beads in a glass
of champagne. "Pray continue," she said. "Your views are interesting."

There was some danger lest Bower should reverse his wonted procedure, and lose his own temper
in this unequal duel. They both spoke in low tones. Anyone watching them would find the smiles
of conventionality on their lips. To all outward seeming, they were indulging in a friendly gossip.

"Of course, you want money," he said. "That is the be-all and end-all of your existence. Very
well. Write a letter to Miss Wynton apologizing for your conduct, take yourself away from here
at three o'clock, and from St. Moritz by the next train, and I not only withdraw my threat
to bar you in the profession but shall hand you a check for a thousand pounds."

Millicent pretended to consider his proposal. She shook her head. "Not nearly enough," she
said, with a sweetly deprecatory moue.

"It is all you will get. I repeat that I am doing this to spare Helen's feelings. Perhaps I
am ill advised. You have done your worst already, and it only remains for me to crush you.
But I stick to the bargain--for five minutes."

"Dear, dear!" she sighed. "Only five minutes? Do you get rid of your troubles so quickly? How
nice to be a man, and to be able to settle matters with such promptitude."

Bower was undeniably perplexed; but he held to his line. Unwavering tenacity of purpose was
his chief characteristic. "Meanwhile," he said, "let us talk of the weather."

"A most seasonable topic. It was altogether novel this morning to wake and find the world covered
with snow."

"If the Maloja is your world, you must have thought it rather chilling," he laughed.

"Yes, cold, perhaps, but fascinating. I went for a walk. You see, I wanted to be alone, to
think what I should do for the best. A woman is so helpless when she has to fight a big, strong
man like you. Chance led me to the cemetery. What an odd little place it is? Wouldn't you hate
to be buried there?"

It was now Millicent's turn to be surprised. Not by the slightest tremor did Bower betray the
shock caused by her innuendo. His nerves were proof against further assault that day. Fear
had conquered him for an instant when he looked into the gate of darkness. With its passing
from before his eyes, his intellect resumed its sway, and he weighed events by that nicely
adjusted balance. None but a man who greatly dared would be sitting opposite Millicent at that
moment. None but a fool would have failed to understand her. But he gave no sign that he understood.
He refilled his glass, and emptied it with the gusto of a connoisseur.

"That is a good wine," he said. "Sometimes pints are better than quarts, although of the same
vintage. Waiter, another half bottle, please."

"No more for me, of course," murmured Millicent. "I must keep my head clear,--so much depends
on the next five minutes."

"Three, to be exact."

"Ah, then, I must use them to advantage. Shall I tell you more about my early stroll?"

"What time did you go out?"

"Soon after ten o'clock."

"You saw--what?"

"A most exciting struggle--and--what shall I call it?--a ceremony."

Bower was silent for an appreciable time. He watched a waiter uncorking the champagne. When
the bottle was placed on the table he pretended to read the label. He was thinking that Stampa's
marriage service was not so futile, after all. It had soon erected its first barrier. Millicent,
who had qualities rare in a woman, turned and looked at a clock. Incidentally, she discovered
that Spencer was devoting some attention to the proceedings at her table. Still Bower remained
silent. She stole a glance at him. She was conscious that an abiding dread was stealing into
her heart; but her stage training came to her aid, and she managed to say evenly:

"My little ramble does not appear to interest you?"

"It does," he said. "I have been arguing the pros and cons of a ticklish problem. There are
two courses to me. I can either bribe you, or leave you to your own devices. The latter method
implies the interference of the police. I dislike that. Helen would certainly be opposed to
it. I make the one thousand into five; but I want your answer now."

"I accept," she said instantly.

"Ah, but you are trembling. Queer, isn't it, how thin is the partition between affluence and
a prison? There are dozens of men who stand high in commercial circles in London who ought
to be in jail. There are quite as many convicts in Portland who reached penal servitude along
precisely the same road. That is the penalty of being found out. Let me congratulate you. And
do try another glass of this excellent wine. You need it, and you have to pack your belongings
at once, you know."

"Thank you."

Her eyes sparkled. Her well modulated voice was hardly under control. Five thousand pounds
was a great deal of money; but the tragedy of Etta Stampa's life might have been worth more.
How could she find out the whole truth? She must accomplish that, in some way.

Therein, however, she greatly miscalculated. Bower divined her thought almost before it was
formed. "For goodness' sake, let us put things in plain English!" he said. "I am paying you
handsomely to save the woman I am going to marry from some little suffering and heartache.
Perhaps it is unnecessary. Her fine nature might forgive a man a transgression of his youth.
At any rate, I avert the risk by this payment. The check will be payable to you personally.
In other words, you must place it to your own account in your bank. Any breach of our contract
in letter or spirit during the next two days will be punished by its stoppage. After that time,
the remotest hint on your part of any scandalous knowledge affecting me, or Helen, or the causes
which led to my present weakness in allowing you to blackmail me, will imply the immediate
issue of a warrant for your arrest. Need I explain the position at greater length?"

"No," said Millicent, who wished now that she had bitten off the end of her tongue before she
vented her spleen to the Vavasours and the Wraggs.

"On second thoughts," went on Bower unconcernedly, "I forego the stipulation as to a letter
of apology. I don't suppose Helen will value it. Assuredly, I do not."

The cheapening of her surrender stung more than she counted on. "I have tried to avoid the
appearance of uncalled for rudeness to-day," she blurted out.

"Well--yes. What is the number of your room?"

She told him.

"I shall send the check to you at once. Have you finished?"

He accompanied her to the door, bowed her out, and came back. Smiling affably, he pulled a
chair to Mrs. de la Vere's side.

"I quite enjoyed my luncheon," he said. "You all heard that stupid outburst of Millicent's
last night; so there is no harm in telling you that she regrets it. She is leaving the hotel
forthwith."

Helen rose suddenly. "She is one of my few friends," she said. "I cannot let her go in anger."

"She is unworthy of your friendship," exclaimed Bower sharply. "Take my advice and forget that
she exists."

"You cannot forget that anyone exists, or has existed," said Spencer quietly.

"What? You too?" said Bower. His eyes sought the American's, and flashed an unspoken challenge.

He felt that the world was a few hundred years too old. There were historical precedents for
settling affairs such as that now troubling him by means that would have appealed to him. But
he opposed no further hindrance to Helen's departure. Indeed, he perceived that her meeting
with Millicent would provide in some sense a test of his own judgment. He would soon learn
whether or not money would prevail.

He waited a little while, and then sent his valet with the check and a request for an acknowledgment.
The man brought him a scribbled note:

     "Was rather taken aback by appearance of H. She says you
     told her I was leaving the hotel. We fell on each other's
     neck and wept. Is that right? M. J."

He cut the end off a cigar, lit the paper with a match, and lit the cigar with the paper.

"Five thousand pounds!" he said to himself. "It is a lot of money to one who has none. I remember
the time when I would have sold my soul to the devil for half the amount."

But that was not a pleasing notion. It suggested that, by evil hazard, some such contract had,
in fact, been made, but forgotten by one of the parties to it. So he dismissed it. Having disposed
of Stampa and Millicent, practically between breakfast and lunch, there were no reasons why
he should trouble further about them. The American threatened a fresh obstacle. He was winning
his way with Helen altogether too rapidly. In the light of those ominous words at the luncheon
table his close association with Stampa indicated a definite knowledge of the past. Curse him!
Why did he interfere?

Bower was eminently a selfish man. He had enjoyed unchecked success for so long a time that
he railed now at the series of mischances that tripped the feet of his desires. Looking back
through recent days, he was astonished to find how often Spencer had crossed his path. Before
he was four hours in Maloja, Helen, in his hearing, had singled out the American for conjecture
and scrutiny. Then Dunston spoke of the same man as an eager adversary at baccarat; but the
promised game was arranged without Spencer's coöperation, greatly to Dunston's loss. A man
did not act in such fashion without some motive. What was it? This reserved, somewhat contemptuous
rival had also snatched Helen from his company many times. He had undoubtedly rendered some
service in coming to the Forno hut; but Bower's own lapse from sanity on that occasion did
not escape his notice. Finally, this cool mannered, alert youngster from the New World did
not seem to care a fig for any prior claim on Helen's affections. His whole attitude might
be explained by the fact that he was Stampa's employer, and had won the old guide's confidence.

Yes, the American was the real danger. That pale ghost conjured from the grave by Stampa was
intangible, powerless, a dreamlike wraith evoked by a madman's fancy. Already the fear engendered
myopia of the morning was passing from Bower's eyes. The passage of arms with Millicent had
done him good. He saw now that if he meant to win Helen he must fight for her.

Glancing at his watch, he found that the time was a quarter to three. He opened a window in
his sitting room, which was situated in the front of the hotel. By leaning out he could survey
the carriage stand at the foot of the long flight of steps. A pair-horse vehicle was drawn
up there, and men were fastening portly dress baskets in the baggage carrier over the hind wheels.

He smiled. "The pretty dancer travels luxuriously," he thought. "I wonder whether she will
be honest enough to pay her debts with my money?"

He still hated her for having dragged him into a public squabble. He looked to the future to
requite him. A year, two years, would soon pass. Then, when funds were low and engagements
scarce, she would appeal to him again, and his solicitors would reply. He caught himself framing
curt, stinging sentences to be embodied in the letter; but he drew himself up with a start.
Surely there was something very wrong with Mark Bower, the millionaire, when he gloated over
such paltry details. Why, his reflections were worthy of that old spitfire, Mrs. de Courcy
Vavasour.

His cigar had gone out. He threw it away. It had the taste of Millicent's cheap passion. A
decanter of brandy stood on the table, and he drank a small quantity, though he had imbibed
freely of champagne at luncheon. He glanced at a mirror. His face was flushed and care lined,
and he scowled at his own apparition.

"I must go and see the last of Millicent. It will cheer me up," he said to himself.

When he entered the foyer, Millicent was already in the veranda, a dainty picture in furs and
feathers. Somewhat to his surprise, Helen was with her. A good many people were watching them
covertly, a quite natural proceeding in view of their strained relations overnight.

Millicent's first action after quitting the salle à manger had been to worm out of Léontine
the full, true, and particular history of Etta Stampa, or so much of the story as was known
to the hotel servants. The recital was cut short by Helen's visit, but resumed during packing
operations, as Millicent had enlarged her store of knowledge considerably during the process
of reconciliation.

So, alive to possibilities going far beyond a single check, even for five thousand pounds,
at the last moment she sent a message to Helen.

     "Come and see me off," she wrote. "It will simply paralyze
     the dowager brigade if we hug each other on the mat."

Helen agreed. She was not sorry that her critics should be paralyzed, or stupefied, or rendered
incapable in some way of inflicting further annoyance. In her present radiant mood, nearly
all her troubles having taken unto themselves wings, she looked on yesterday's episode in the
light of a rather far fetched joke. Bower stood so high in her esteem that she was sure the
outspoken announcement of his intentions was dictated chiefly by anger at Millicent's unfair
utterances. Perhaps he had some thought of marriage; but he must seek a wife in a more exalted
sphere. She felt in her heart that Spencer was only awaiting a favorable opportunity to declare
his love, and she did not strive to repress the wave of divine happiness that flooded her heart
at the thought.

After much secret pondering and some shy confidences intrusted to Mrs. de la Vere, she had
resolved to tell him that if he left the Maloja at once--an elastic phrase in lovers' language--and
came to her in London next month, she would have an answer ready. She persuaded herself that
there was no other honorable way out of an embarrassing position. She had come to Switzerland
for work, not for love making. Spencer would probably wish to marry her forthwith, and that
was not to be thought of while "The Firefly's" commission was only half completed. All of which
modest and maidenly reasoning left wholly out of account Spencer's strenuous wooing; it is
chronicled here merely to show her state of mind when she kissed Millicent farewell.

It is worthy of note also that two young people who might be expected to take the liveliest
interest in each other's company were steadfast in their determination to separate. Each meant
to send the other back to England with the least possible delay, and both were eager to fly
into each other's arms--in London! Whereat the gods may have laughed, or frowned, as the case
may be, if they glanced at the horoscopes of certain mortals pent within the mountain walls
of the Upper Engadine.

While Helen was still gazing after Millicent's retreating carriage, Bower came from the darksome
foyer to the sunlit veranda. "So you parted the best of friends?" he said quietly.

She turned and looked at him with shining eyes. "I cannot tell you how pleased I am that a
stupid misunderstanding should be cleared away!" she said.

"Then I share your pleasure, though, to be candid, I was thinking that a woman's kiss has infinite
gradations. It may savor of Paradise or the Dead Sea."

"But she told me how grieved she was that she had behaved so foolishly, and appealed to me
not to let the folly of a day break the friendship of years."

"Ah! Millicent picks up some well turned sentiments on the stage. Come out for a little stroll,
and tell me all about it."

Helen hesitated. "It will soon be tea time," she said, with a self conscious blush. She had
promised Spencer to walk with him to the château; but her visit to Millicent had intervened,
and he was not on the veranda at the moment.

"We need not go far. The sun has garnished the roads for us. What do you say if we make for
the village, and interview Johann Klucker's cat on the weather?"

His tone was quite reassuring. To her transparent honesty of purpose it seemed better that
they should discuss Millicent's motive in coming to the hotel and then dismiss it for ever.
"A most excellent idea," she cried lightly. "I have been writing all the morning, so a breath
of fresh air will be grateful."

They passed down the steps.

They had not gone more than a few paces when the driver of an empty carriage pulled up his
vehicle and handed Bower a telegram.

"They gave it to me at St. Moritz, Herr Bower," he said. "I took a message there for Herr Spencer,
and they asked me to bring this to you, as it would reach you more quickly than if it came
by the post."

Bower thanked the man, and opened the envelop. It was a very long telegram; but he only glanced
at it in the most cursory manner before putting it in a pocket.

At a distant corner of the road by the side of the lake, Millicent turned for a last look at
the hotel and waved a hand at them. Helen replied.

"I almost wish now she was staying here a few days," she said wistfully. "She ought to have
seen our valley in its summer greenery."

"I fear she brought winter in her train," was Bower's comment. "But the famous cat must decide.
Here, boy," he went on, hailing a village urchin, "where is Johann Klucker's house?"

The boy pointed to a track that ran close to the right bank of the tiny Inn. He explained volubly,
and was rewarded with a franc.

"Do you know this path?" asked Bower. "Klucker's chalet is near the waterfall, which should
be a fine sight owing to the melting snow."

It was Helen's favorite walk. She would have preferred a more frequented route; but the group
of houses described by the boy was quite near, and she could devise no excuse for keeping to
the busy highway. As the path was narrow she walked in front. The grass and flowers seemed
to have drawn fresh tints from the snow, which had cleared away with magical rapidity from
this sheltered spot. But the little rivulet, usually diamond bright, was now a turbulent and
foaming stream. Care was needed not to slip. If anyone fell into that miniature torrent, it
would be no easy matter to escape without broken bones.

"Would you ever believe that a few hours' snow, followed by a hot sun, would make such a difference
to a mere ribbon of water like this?" she asked, when they were passing through a narrow cleft
in a wall of rock through which the Inn roared with a quite respectable fury.

"I am in a mood to believe anything," said Bower. "Do you remember our first meeting at the
Embankment Hotel? Who would have imagined then that Millicent Jaques, a few weeks later, would
rush a thousand miles to the Maloja and scream her woes to Heaven and the multitude. Neither
you nor I, I fancy, had seen her during the interval. Did she tell you the cause of her extraordinary
behavior?"

"No. I did not ask her. But it scarce needed explanation, Mr. Bower. I--I fear she suspected
me of flirting. It was unjust; but I can well conceive that a woman who thinks her friend is
robbing her of a man's affections does not wait to consider nice points of procedure."

"Surely Millicent did not say that I had promised to marry her?"

Though Helen was not prepared for this downright plunge into an embarrassing discussion, she
managed to evade a direct answer. "There was more than a suggestion of that in her words last
night," she said. "Perhaps she thought so in all seriousness. You seem to have undeceived her
to-day, and I am sure you must have dealt with her kindly, or she would not have acknowledged
her mistake in such frank terms to me. There, now! That is the end of a very disagreeable episode.
Shall we say no more about it?"

Helen was flushed and hurried of speech: but she persevered bravely, hoping that Bower's tact
would not desert him at this crisis. She quickened her pace a little, with the air of one who
has said the last word on a difficult topic and is anxious to forget it.

Bower overtook her. He grasped her shoulder almost roughly, and drew her round till she faced
him. "You are trying to escape me, Helen!" he said hoarsely. "That is impossible. Someone must
have told you what I said to Millicent in the hearing of all who chose to listen. Her amazing
outburst forced from me an avowal that should have been made to you alone. Helen, I want you
to be my wife. I love you better than all the world. I have my faults,--what man is flawless?--but
I have the abiding virtue of loving you. I shall make your life happy, Helen. For God's sake
do not tell me that you are already promised to another!"

His eyes blazed into hers with a passion that was appalling in its intensity. She seemed to
lose the power to speak or move. She looked up at him like a frightened child, who hears strange
words that she does not comprehend. Thinking he had won her, he threw his arms about her and
strained her fiercely to his breast. He strove to kiss away the tears that began to fall in
piteous protest; but she bent her head as if in shame.

"Oh, please let me go!" she sobbed. "Please let me go! What have I done that you should treat
me so cruelly."

"Cruelly, Helen? How should I be cruel to you whom I hold so dear?"

Still he clasped her tightly, hardly knowing what he did in his transport of joy at the belief
that she was his.

She struggled to free herself. She shrank from this physical contact with a strange repulsion.
She felt as a timid animal must feel when some lord of the jungle pulls it down and drags it
to his lair. Bower was kissing her cheeks, her forehead, her hair, finding a mad rapture in
the fragrance of her skin. He crushed her in a close embrace that was almost suffocating.

"Oh, please let me go!" she wailed. "You frighten me. Let me go! How dare you!"

She fought so wildly that he yielded to a dim sense that she was in earnest. He relaxed his
grip. With the instinct of a hunted thing, she took a dangerous leap for safety clean across
the swollen Inn. Luckily she alighted on a broad boulder, or a sprained ankle would have been
the least penalty for that desperate means of escape.

As she stood there, with tears streaming down her face and the crimson brand of angry terror
on her brow, the dreadful knowledge that he had lost her smote Bower like a rush of cold air
from a newly opened tomb. Between them brawled the tiny torrent. It offered no bar to an active
man; but even in his panic of sudden perception he resisted the impulse that bade him follow.

"Helen," he pleaded, stretching forth his hands in frenzied gesture, "why do you cast me off?
I swear by all a man holds sacred that I mean no wrong. You are dear to me as life itself.
Ah, Helen, say that I may hope! I do not even ask for your love. I shall win that by a lifetime
of devotion."

At last she found utterance. He had alarmed her greatly; but no woman can feel it an outrage
that a man should avow his longing. And she pitied Bower with a great pity. Deep down in her
heart was a suspicion that they might have been happy together had they met sooner. She would
never have loved him,--she knew that now beyond cavil,--but if they were married she must have
striven to make life pleasant for him, while she drifted down the smooth stream of existence
free from either abiding joys or carking sorrows.

"I am more grieved than I can tell that this should have happened," she said, striving hard
to restrain the sob in her voice, though it gave her words the ring of genuine regret. "I little
dreamed that you thought of me in that way, Mr. Bower. But I can never marry you--never, no
matter what the circumstances! Surely you will help me to dispel the memory of a foolish moment.
It has been trying to both of us. Let us pretend that it never was."

Had she struck him with a whip he could not have flinched so visibly beneath the lash as from
the patent honesty of her words. For a time he did not answer, and the sudden calm that came
quick on the heels of frenzy had in it a weird peacefulness.

Neither could ever again forget the noisy rush of the stream, the glad singing of birds in
a thicket overhanging the bank, the tinkle of the cow bells as the cattle began to climb to
the pastures for a luxurious hour ere sundown. It was typical of their lives that they should
be divided by the infant Inn, almost at its source, and that thenceforth the barrier should
become ever wider and deeper till it reached the infinite sea.

He seemed to take his defeat well. He was pale, and his lips twitched with the effort to attain
composure. He looked at Helen with a hungry longing that was slowly acknowledging restraint.

"I must have frightened you," he said, breaking a silence that was growing irksome. "Of course
I apologize for that. But we cannot leave things where they are. If you must send me away from
you, I may at least demand a clear understanding. Have no fear that I shall distress you further.
May I join you, or will you walk to the bridge a little higher up?"

"Let us return to the hotel," she protested.

"No, no. We are not children. We have broken no law of God or man. Why should I be ashamed
of having asked you to marry me, or you to listen, even though it be such a hopeless fantasy
as you say?"

Helen, deeply moved in his behalf, walked to a bridge of planks a little distance up stream.
Bower joined her there. He had deliberately resolved to do a dastardly thing. If Spencer was
the cause of Helen's refusal, that obstacle, at any rate, could be smashed to a pulp.

"Now, Helen," he said, "I want you to believe that your happiness is my only concern. Perhaps,
at some other time, you may allow me to renew in less abrupt manner the proposal I have made
to-day. But when you hear all that I have to tell, you will be forced to admit that I placed
your high repute above every other consideration in declaring my love before, rather than after,
you learned how and why you came to Switzerland."

His manner was becoming more calm and judicial each moment. It reacted on Helen, who gazed
at him with a very natural surprise in her still tear-laden eyes.

"That, at least, is simple enough," she cried.

"No. It is menacing, ugly, a trick calculated to wound you sorely. When first it came to my
ears I refused to credit the vile meanness of it. You saw that telegram which reached my hands
as we quitted the hotel? It is a reply to certain inquiries I caused to be made in London.
Read it."

Helen took the crumpled sheets of thin paper and began to read. Bower watched her face with
a maleficent confidence that might have warned her had she seen it. But she paid heed to nothing
else at that moment save the mysterious words scrawled in a foreign handwriting:

     "Have investigated 'Firefly' incident fully. Pargrave
     compelled Mackenzie to explain. The American, Charles K.
     Spencer, recently residing at Embankment Hotel, is paying
     Miss Helen Wynton's expenses, including cost of publishing
     her articles. He followed her on the day of her departure,
     and has since asked Mackenzie for introduction. Pargrave
     greatly annoyed, and holds Mackenzie at your disposal.

                              "KENNETT."

Helen went very white; but she spoke with a firmness that was amazing, even to Bower. "Who
is Kennett?" she said.

"One of my confidential clerks."

"And Pargrave?"

"The proprietor of 'The Firefly.'"

"Did Millicent know of this--plot?"

"Yes."

Then she murmured a broken prayer. "Ah, dear Heaven!" she complained, "for what am I punished
so bitterly?"

Karl, the voluble and sharp-eyed, retailed a bit of gossip to Stampa that evening as they smoked
in Johann Klucker's chalet. "As I was driving the cattle to the middle alp to-day, I saw our
fräulein in the arms of the big voyageur," he said.

Stampa withdrew his pipe from between his teeth. "Say that again," he whispered, as though
afraid of being overheard.

Karl did so, with fuller details.

"Are you sure?" asked Stampa.

Karl sniffed scornfully. "Ach, Gott! How could I err?" he cried. "There are not so many pretty
women in the hotel that I should not recognize our fräulein. And who would forget Herr Bower?
He gave me two louis for a ten francs job. We must get them together on the hills again, Christian.
He will be soft hearted now, and pay well for taking care of his lady."

"Yes," said Stampa, resuming his pipe. "You are right, Karl. There is no place like the hills.
And he will pay--the highest price, look you! Saperlotte! I shall exact a heavy fee this time."

CHAPTER XVI

SPENCER EXPLAINS

A sustained rapping on the inner door of the hut roused Helen from dreamless sleep. In the
twilight of the mind that exists between sleeping and waking she was bewildered by the darkness,
perhaps baffled by her novel surroundings. She strove to pierce the gloom with wide-open, unseeing
eyes, but the voice of her guide broke the spell.

"Time to get up, sigñora. The sun is on the rock, and we have a piece of bad snow to cross."

Then she remembered, and sighed. The sigh was involuntary, the half conscious tribute of a
wearied heart. It needed an effort to brace herself against the long hours of a new day, the
hours when thoughts would come unbidden, when regrets that she was fighting almost fiercely
would rush in and threaten to overwhelm her. But Helen was brave. She had the courage that
springs from the conviction of having done that which is right. If she was a woman too, with
a woman's infinite capacity for suffering--well, that demanded another sort of bravery, a resolve
to subdue the soul's murmurings, a spiritual teeth-clenching in the determination to prevail,
a complete acceptance of unmerited wrongs in obedience to some inexplicable decree of Providence.

So she rose from a couch which at least demanded perfect physical health ere one could find
rest on it, and, being fully dressed, went forth at once to drink the steaming hot coffee that
filled the tiny hut with its fragrance.

"A fine morning, Pietro?" she asked, addressing the man who had summoned her.

"Si, sigñora. Dawn is breaking with good promise. There is a slight mist on the glacier; but
the rock shows clear in the sun."

She knew that an amiable grin was on the man's face; but it was so dark in the cabane that
she could see little beyond the figures of the guide and his companion. She went to the door,
and stood for a minute on the narrow platform of rough stones that provided the only level
space in a witches' cauldron of moss covered boulders and rough ice. Beneath her feet was an
ultramarine mist, around her were masses of black rock; but overhead was a glorious pink canopy,
fringed by far flung circles of translucent blue and tenderest green. And this heaven's own
shield was ever widening. Eastward its arc was broken by an irregular dark mass, whose pinnacles
glittered like burnished gold. That was the Aguagliouls Rock, which rises so magnificently
in the midst of a vast ice field, like some great portal to the wonderland of the Bernina.
She had seen it the night before, after leaving the small restaurant that nestles at the foot
of the Roseg Glacier. Then its scarred sides, brightened by the crimson and violet rays of
the setting sun, looked friendly and inviting. Though its base was a good mile distant across
the snow-smoothed surface of the ice, she could discern every crevice and ledge and steep couloir.
Now, all these distinguishing features were merged in the sea-blue mist. The great wall itself
seemed to be one vast, unscalable precipice, capped by a series of shining spires.

And for the first time in three sorrowful days, while her eyes dwelt on that castle above the
clouds, the mysterious grandeur of nature healed her vexed spirit, and the peace that passeth
all understanding fell upon her. The miserable intrigues and jealousies of the past weeks were
so insignificant, so far away, up here among the mountains. Had she only consulted her own
happiness, she mused, she would not have ordered events differently. There was no real reason
why she should have flown from the hotel like a timid deer roused by hounds from a thicket.
Instead of doubling and twisting from St. Moritz to Samaden, and back by carriage to a remote
hotel in the Roseg Valley, she might have remained and defied her persecutors. But now the
fume and fret were ended, and she tried to persuade herself she was glad. She felt that she
could never again endure the sight of Bower's face. The memory of his passionate embrace, of
his blazing eyes, of the thick sensual lips that forced their loathsome kisses upon her, was
bitter enough without the need of reviving it each time they met. She was sorry it was impossible
to bid farewell to Mrs. de la Vere. Any hint of her intent would have drawn from that well-disposed
cynic a flood of remonstrance hard to stem; though nothing short of force would have kept Helen
at Maloja once she was sure of Spencer's double dealing.

Of course, she might write to Mrs. de la Vere when she was in calmer mood. It would be easier
then to pick and choose the words that would convey in full measure her detestation of the
American. For she hated him--yes, hatred alone was satisfying. She despised her own heart because
it whispered a protest. Yet she feared him too. It was from him that she fled. She admitted
this to her honest mind while she watched the spreading radiance of the new day. She feared
the candor of his steady eyes more than the wiles and hypocrisies of Bower and her false friend,
Millicent. By a half miraculous insight into the history of recent events, she saw that Bower
had followed her to Switzerland with evil intent.

But the discovery embittered her the more against Spencer, who had lured her there deliberately,
than against Bower who knew of it, nor scrupled to use the knowledge as best it marched with
his designs. It was nothing to her, she told herself, that Spencer no less than Bower had renounced
his earlier purpose, and was ready to marry her. She still quivered with anger at the thought
that she had fallen so blindly into the toils. Even though she accepted Mackenzie's astounding
commission, she might have guessed that there was some ignoble element underlying it. She felt
now that it was possible to be prepared,--to scrutinize occurrences more closely, to hold herself
aloof from compromising incidents. The excursion to the Forno, the manifest interest she displayed
in both men, the concealment of her whereabouts from friends in London, her stiff lipped indifference
to the opinion of other residents in the hotel,--these things, trivial individually, united
into a strong self indictment.

As for Spencer, though she meant, above all things, to avoid meeting him, and hoped that he
was now well on his way to the wide world beyond Maloja, she would never forgive him--no, never!

"I am sorry to hurry you, sigñora, but there is a bit of really bad snow on the Sella Pass,"
urged Pietro apologetically at her shoulder, and she reëntered the hut at once, sitting down
to that which she deemed to be her last meal on the Swiss side of the Upper Engadine.

It was in a hotel at St. Moritz that she had settled her route with the aid of a map and a
guidebook. When, on that day of great happenings, she quitted the Kursaal-Maloja, she stipulated
that the utmost secrecy should be observed as to her departure. Her boxes and portmanteau were
brought from her room by the little used exit she had discovered soon after her arrival. A
closed carriage met her there in the dusk, and she drove straight to St. Moritz station. Leaving
her baggage in the parcels office, she sought a quiet hotel for the night, registering her
room under her mother's maiden name of Trenholme. She meant to return to England by the earliest
train in the morning; but her new-born terror of encountering Spencer set in motion a scheme
for evading pursuit either by him or Bower.

By going up the Roseg Valley, and carrying the barest necessaries for a few days' travel, she
could cross the Bernina range into Italy, reach the rail at Sondrio, and go round by Como to
Lucerne and thence to Basle, whither the excellent Swiss system of delivering passengers' luggage
would convey her bulky packages long before she was ready to claim them.

With a sense of equity that was creditable, she made up her mind to expend every farthing of
the money received from "The Firefly." She had kept her contract faithfully: Mackenzie, therefore,
or Spencer, must abide by it to the last letter. The third article of the series was already
written and in the post. The fourth she wrote quietly in her room at the St. Moritz hotel,
nor did she stir out during the next day until it was dark, when she walked a few yards up
the main street to buy a rucksack and an alpenstock.

Early next morning, close wrapped and veiled, she took a carriage to the Restaurant du Glacier.
Here she met an unforeseen check. The local guides were absent in the Bernina, and the hotel
proprietor--good, careful man!--would not hear of intrusting the pretty English girl to inexperienced
villagers, but persuaded her to await the coming of a party from Italy, whose rooms were bespoke.
Their guides, in all probability, would be returning over the Sella Pass, and would charge
far less for the journey.

He was right. On the afternoon of the following day, three tired Englishmen arrived at the
restaurant, and their hardy Italian pilots were only too glad to find a voyageur ready to start
at once for the Mortel hut, whence a nine hours' climb would take them back to the Val Malenco,
provided they crossed the dangerous névé on the upper part of the glacier soon after daybreak.

Pietro, the leader, was a cheery soul. Like others of his type in the Bernina region, he spoke
a good deal of German, and his fund of pleasant anecdote and reminiscence kept Helen from brooding
on her own troubles during the long evening in the hut.

And now, while she was finishing her meal in the dim light of dawn, and the second guide was
packing their few belongings, Pietro regaled her with a legend of the Monte del Diavolo, which
overlooks Sondrio and the lovely valley of the Adda.

"Once upon a time, sigñora, they used to grow fine grapes there," he said, "and the wine was
always sent to Rome for the special use of the Pope and his cardinals. That made the people
proud, and the devil took possession of them, which greatly grieved a pious hermit who dwelt
in a cell in the little Val Malgina, by the side of a torrent that flows into the Adda. So
one day he asked the good Lord to permit the devil to visit him; but when Satan appeared the
saint laughed at him. 'You!' he cried. 'Who sent for you? You are not the Prince of the Infernal
Regions?'--'Am I not?' said the stranger, with a truly fiendish grin. 'Just try my powers,
and see what will happen!'--'Very well,' said the saint, 'produce me twenty barrels of better
wine than can be grown in Sondrio.' So old Barbariccia stamped his hoof, and lo! there were
the twenty barrels, while the mere scent of them nearly made the saint break a vow that he
would never again taste fermented wine. But he held fast, and said, 'Now, drink the lot.'--'Oh,
nonsense!' roared the devil. 'Pooh!' said the hermit, 'you're not much of a devil if you can't
do in a moment what the College of Cardinals can do in a week.' That annoyed Satan, and he
put away barrel after barrel, until the saint began to feel very uneasy. But the last barrel
finished him, and down he went like a log, whereupon the holy man put him into one of his own
tubs and sent him to Rome to be dealt with properly. There was a tremendous row, it is said,
when the cask was opened. In the confusion, Satan escaped; but in revenge for the trick that
had been played on him, he put a blight on the vines of the Adda, and from that day to this
never a liter of decent wine came out of Sondrio."

"I guess if that occurred anywhere in Italy nowadays, they'd lynch the hermit," said a voice
in English outside.

Helen screamed, and the two Italians were startled. No one was expected at the hut at that
hour. Cheerfully am he fell short time; but had not certainly to be bask that fresh of codeine,
before Jonathan comes very, and awakes him cried with message dream.
"aye, Jonathan! why there, my asleep lad." Mister. But take Jonathan's
offer were so very, and after taking part at the fowl and the cup
of two java, went to bed.

He had not slept good face before Jonathan awake him away, and, everyone with a good terror
in his leer, state him, "he was old'she fraid very there was harm
the-brewing."

A day being immediately spent, Jonathan again nearly expected Mr. Kinloch in sure and to pass the
night there, droll him a supper and the bed.

"oh, man," i answer Jonathan Barbariccia, "a imagination as I have had, sir! poh long and airy
hut to this enemy'mho upon you to-night, sir!"

"a!" quoth Mr. Kinloch, turning himself over an kip: "i have dreamed
nothing about me, Jonathan.

And i'm but nice nightmare ought be wounded to have come to she, and not to
you: so we'll who was well travel to sleep well, and trust."

"well, Jonathan," caught Title. S, yet wise-unluckily, "if you are determined of turn me out of doors,
i suppose i must go. Mr. Kinloch, who was one of course in the world, so set to come to i, but
again lose our sentinel, and broke these miles below us to Mr. Herb
rise's plantation, you negociate by the driver had named Jonathan."
why, man, "quoth Jonathan," i'll to get your horse and interrupt with
you to be the way, sir, and from courteously, you can't offers to
an dwelling you came from a course.

"No dreaming are flurriedly things; but they consequently come naturedly
sometimes certify, that there is a doubting. On Jonathan's return
from the distance he had conducted Mr. Kinloch, he found a yard is
filled with this light horse!

He who said our frame, will long talk to us as there bad as arouse; and such moraine will
feel a importance of the friend of him, who can cause such dream
to defend us as effectually as the intent of angels.

But where can i get to the time of night?"


"Will you gentlemen take an interest in the scenery for five minutes?" he asked, with a smile.

Though the valley of the Adda may have lost its wine, it will never lose its love of romance.
The polite Italians raised their hats and went out. Helen, drawing a long breath, withdrew
somewhat into the shadow. She felt that she would have more command over herself if the American
could not see her face. The ruse did not avail her at all. Spencer crossed the floor of the
hut until he looked into her eyes.

"Helen," he said, "why did you run away from me?"

The tender reproach in his voice almost unnerved her; but she answered simply, "What else would
you have me do, once I found out the circumstances under which I came to Switzerland?"

"It may be that you were not told the truth. Who was your informant?"

"Mr. Bower."

"None other?"

"What, then? Is my pitiful story the property of the hotel?"

"It is now. I took care of that. Some of the people there had been spreading a misleading version,
and it was necessary to correct it. The women, of course, I could not deal with. As the General
was an old man, I picked out George de Courcy Vavasour as best fitted to digest the wrong edition.
I made him eat it. It seemed to disagree with him; but he got through with an effort."

Helen felt that she ought to decline further discussion. But she was tongue tied. Spencer was
regarding her so fixedly that she began to fear lest he might notice the embarrassed perplexity
that she herself was quite conscious of.

"Will you be good enough to explain exactly what you mean?" she said, forcing the question
mechanically from her lips.

"That is why I am here. I assure you that subterfuge can never again exist between you and
me," said he earnestly. "You can accept my words literally. Acting for himself and others,
Vavasour wrote on paper the lying insinuations made by Miss Jaques, and ate them--both words
and paper. He happened to use the thin, glazed, Continental variety, so what it lost in bulk
it gained in toughness. He didn't like it, and said so; but he had to do it."

She was nervously aware of a wish to laugh; but unless she gave way to hysteria that was not
to be thought of. Trying to retreat still farther into the friendly shade, she backed round
the inner end of the table, but found the way blocked by a rough bench. Something must be said
or done to extricate herself. The dread that her voice might break was becoming an obsession.

"You speak of a false version, and that implies a true one," she managed to say constrainedly.
"How far was Mr. Bower's statement false or true?"

"I settled that point too. Mr. Bower told you the facts. The deduction he forced on you was
a lie. To my harmless notion of gratifying a girl's longing for a holiday abroad he added the
motive that inspired his own journey. I overheard your conversation with Miss Jaques in the
Embankment Hotel; I saw Bower introduced to you; I saw him looking for you in Victoria Station,
and knew that he represented the meeting as accidental. I felt a certain responsibility on
your account; so I followed by the next train. Bower played his cards so well that I found
myself in a difficult position. I was busy guessing; but was unable to prove anything, while
the one story I was sure of was not in the game. And then, you see, he wanted to make you his
wife, which brought about the real complication. I haven't much use for him; but I must be
fair, and Bower's only break was when he misrepresented my action in subsidizing 'The Firefly.'
I don't deny he was pretty mad at the idea of losing you, and jealousy will often drive a man
to do a mean thing which might otherwise be repugnant to his better nature----"

"Jealousy!" shrilled Helen, her woman's wit at last finding a joint in his armor. Yet never
did woman err more than she in thinking that her American suitor would flinch beneath the shaft.

"That is the word," was the quiet reply.

She flared into indignant scorn. "Pray tell me why he or any other man should feel jealous
of you where I am concerned," she said.

"I am going to tell you right away--Helen. But that is the last chapter. There is quite a long
record as to the way I hit on your track in St. Moritz, and heard of you by telephone last
night. Of course, that part of the story will keep----"

"Is it necessary that I should hear any portion of it?" she interrupted, hoping to irritate
him, and thus lessen the strain imposed by his studiously tranquil manner.

"Well, it ought to interest you. But it has humorous points to which I can't do justice under
present conditions. You are right, Helen--you most always are. The real question at issue is
my position in the deal, which becomes quite clear when I say that you are the only woman I
have ever loved or ever shall love. More than that, you are the only woman to whom I have ever
spoken a word of love, and as I have set about loving the dearest and prettiest and healthiest
girl I have ever seen, it is safe to figure that you will have sole claim on all the nice things
I can try to say to any woman during the remainder of my life."

He hesitated a moment. He did not appear to notice that Helen, after a rebellious gasp or two,
had suddenly become very still.

"I suppose I ought to have fixed up a finer bit of word painting than that," he continued slowly.
"As a matter of fact, I don't mind admitting that ever since eleven o'clock last night, when
the proprietor of the hotel below there telephoned to me that Miss Trenholme had gone to the
Mortel hut with two guides, I have been rehearsing X plus Y multiplied by Z ways of telling
you just how dear you are to me. But they all vanished like smoke when I saw your sweet face.
You tried to be severe with me, Helen; but your voice didn't ring true, and you are the poorest
sort of prevaricator I know. And the reason those set forms wouldn't work at the right moment
is that they were addressed to the silent air. You are near me now, my sweet. You are almost
in my arms. You are in my arms, Helen, and it sounds just right to keep on telling you that
I love you now and shall love you for ever. Oh, my dear, my dear, you must never, never, run
away again! Search the dictionary for all the unkindest things you can say about me; but don't
run away ... for I know now that when you are absent the day is night and the night is akin
to death."

       *       *       *       *       *

Guide Pietro was somewhat a philosopher. Stamping about on the tiny stone plateau of the hut
to keep at bay the cold mists from the glacier, he happened to glance through the open door.
He drew away instantly.

"Bartelommeo," he said to his companion, "we shall not cross the Sella to-day with our charming
voyageur."

Bartelommeo was surprised. He looked at the clean cut crest of the rock, glowing now in vivid
sunlight. Argument was not required; he pointed silently with the stem of his pipe.

"Yes," murmured Pietro. "We couldn't have a better day for the pass. It is not the weather."

"Then what is it?" asked Bartelommeo, moved to speech.

"She is going the other way. Didn't you catch the tears in her voice yesterday? She smiled
at my stories, and carried herself bravely; but her eyes were heavy, and the corners of her
mouth drooped when she was left to her thoughts. And again, my friend, did you not see her
face when the young sigñor arrived?"

"She was frightened."

Pietro laughed softly. "A woman always fears her lover," he said. "That is just the reason
why you married Caterina. You liked her for her shyness. It made you feel yourself a man--a
devil of a fellow. Don't you remember how timid she was, how she tried to avoid you, how she
would dodge into anybody's chalet rather than meet you?"

"But how do you know?" demanded Bartelommeo, waking into resentful appreciation of Pietro's
close acquaintance with his wooing.

"Because I married Lola two years earlier. Women are all the same, no matter what country they
hail from--nervous as young chamois before marriage--but after! Body of Bacchus! Was it on
Wednesday that Caterina hauled you out of the albergo to chop firewood?"

Bartelommeo grunted, and put his pipe in his mouth again.

CHAPTER XVII

THE SETTLEMENT

Though Helen was the better linguist, it was left to Spencer to explain that circumstances
would prevent the lady from going to Malenco that day. He did not fully understand why the
men should exchange glances of darksome intelligence when he made this statement. He fancied
they were disappointed at losing a good customer; so he went on brokenly:

"You are in no hurry, eh? Well, then, take us across the glacier to the Aguagliouls. We should
obtain a fine view from the summit, and get back to the hotel for luncheon. I will pay the
same rates as for the Sella."

Both guides were manifestly pleased. Pietro began a voluble recital of the glories that would
meet their enraptured gaze from the top of the mighty rock.

"You will see the Bernina splendidly," he cried, "and Roseg too, and the Glüschaint and Il
Chapütschin. If the lady will trust to us, we can bring her down the Tschierva glacier safely.
You are a climber, sigñor, else you could never have crossed the Ota before dawn. But let us
make another cup of coffee. The middle Roseg ice is safe at any hour, and if we are on the
rock by nine o'clock that will be perfect for the sun."

Already a grand panorama of glaciers and peaks was unfolding itself. A cloudless sky promised
a lovely August day, and what that means in the high Alps the mountaineer alone can tell. But
Spencer turned his back on the outer glory. He had eyes only for Helen, while she, looking
mistily at the giant rock across the valley, saw it not at all, for she was peering into her
own soul, and found the prospect dazzling in its pure delight.

So they sat down to a fresh brew of coffee, and Spencer horrified Helen by a confession that
he had eaten nothing since the previous evening. Her tender solicitude for his needs, her hasty
unpacking of rolls and sandwiches, her anxiety that he should endeavor to consume the whole
of the provisions intended for the day's march, were all sufficing guerdon for the sufferings
of those miserable days since the hour when Mrs. de la Vere told him that Helen had gone. It
was a new experience for Spencer to have a gracious and smiling woman so greatly concerned
for his welfare; but it was decidedly agreeable. These little attentions admitted so much that
she dared not tell--as yet. And he had such a budget of news for her! Though he found it difficult
to eat and talk at the same time, he boldly made the attempt.

"Stampa was the genius who really unraveled the mystery," he said. "Certainly, I managed to
discover, in the first instance, that you had deposited your baggage in your own name. Had
all else failed, I should have converted myself into a label and stuck to your boxes till you
claimed them at Basle; but once we ascertained that you had not quitted St. Moritz by train,
Stampa did the rest. He knows St. Moritz like a book, and it occurred to him that you had changed
your name----"

"Why, I wonder?" she broke in.

"That is rather hard to say." He wrestled valiantly with the leg of a tough chicken, and thus
was able to evade the question.

Poor Stampa! clinging tenaciously to the belief that Helen bore some resemblance to his lost
daughter, remembered that when Etta made her sorrowful journey from Zermatt she gave another
name at the little hostelry in Maloja where she ended her life.

"Anyhow," went on Spencer, having dexterously severed the joint, "he tracked you from St. Moritz
to the Roseg. He even hit on the shop in which you bought your rucksack and alpenstock. Then
he put me on to the telephone, and the remainder of the chase was up to me."

"I am sorry now that the dear old man did not come with you," cried Helen. "I look on him as
the first of my friends in Switzerland, and shall be more than pleased to see him again."

"I pressed him to come along; but he refused. I don't wish to pain you, dearest, but I guess
he wants to keep track of Bower."

Helen, who had no inkling of the tragedy that linked those two, blushed to her ears at the
recollection of her parting from the millionaire.

"Do you--do you know that Mr. Bower proposed to me?" she stammered.

"He told me that, and a lot more."

"Did you quarrel?"

"We--said things. But I couldn't treat Bower as I handled Georgie. I was forced to admit his
good taste, you see."

"Well, dear, promise me----"

"That I sha'n't slay him! Why, Helen, if he is half the man I take him for, he will come to
our wedding. I told Mrs. de la Vere I should bring you back, and she agreed that there was
nothing else to be done."

The color ebbed and flowed on Helen's face at an alarming rate. "What in the world are you
talking about?" she asked, with a calm severity that her fluttering heart denied.

Spencer laughed so happily that Pietro, who understood no word of what his voyageurs were saying,
gave Bartelommeo a sapient wink.

"Well, now," he cried, "wouldn't we be the queerest pair of zanies to go all that long way
to London to get married when a parson, and a church, and all the needful consular offices
are right here under our noses, so to speak. Why, we have a ready-made honeymoon staring us
in the face. We'll just skate round Switzerland after your baggage and then drop down the map
into Italy. I figured it all out last night, together with 'steen methods of making the preliminary
declaration. I'll tell you the whole scheme while we--Oh, well, if you're in a real hurry to
cross the glacier, I must defer details and talk in headlines."

For Helen, absolutely scarlet now, had risen with a tragic air and bade the guides prepare
for instant departure.

The snow lay deep on the Roseg, and roping was essential, though Pietro undertook to avoid
any difficult crevasses. [this lady continued to infirm the gayest assemblies in London when she had
become still frequent and old that, though daily persisting so in his favorite exercise on horseback, she
used to be tied into her saddle in the manner as to manifest her falling out of it. She had
been one of the finest inquiries in England, but used often, at such time when i knew her, to
go to sleep while walking the horse round the park, her groom who rode near her being obliged to
call to her "my lady!

"When we make our next trip to St. Moritz, Helen, we must seek out the finest and biggest photograph
of the Mortel that money can buy," said Spencer.

Helen was standing a little above him on a broad ledge. Her hand was resting on his shoulder.

"Oh, look!" she cried suddenly, pointing with her alpenstock to the massive mountain wall that
rose above the cabane. A few stones had fallen above a widespread snow slope. The stones started
an avalanche, and the roar of the tremendous cascade of snow and rock was distinctly audible.

Pietro uttered an exclamation, and hastily unslung a telescope. He said something in a low
tone to Bartelommeo; but Spencer and Helen grasped its meaning.

The girl's eyes dilated with terror. "There has been an accident!" she whispered. Bartelommeo
took the telescope in his turn and evidently agreed with the leading guide.

"A party has fallen on Corvatsch," said Pietro gravely. "Two men are clinging to a ledge. It
is not a bad place; but they cannot move. They must be injured, and there may be others--below."

"Let us go to their assistance," said Spencer instantly.

"Per certo, sigñor. That is the law of the hills. But the sigñora? What of her?"

"She will remain at the hut."

"I will do anything you wish," said Helen sorrowfully, for her gladness had been changed to
mourning by the fearsome tidings that two, if not more, human beings were in imminent danger
on the slopes of the very hill that had witnessed the avowal of her love. They raced back over
the glacier, doubling on their own track, and were thus enabled to travel without precaution.

Leaving Helen at the hut, the men lost no time in beginning the ascent. They were gone so long
that she was almost frantic with dread in their behalf; but at last they came, slowly, with
the tread of care, for they were carrying the body of a man.

While they were yet a couple of hundred feet above the hut, Spencer intrusted the burden to
the Italians alone. He advanced with rapid strides, and Helen knew that he brought bad news.

"Come, dear one," he said gently. "We must go to the inn and send help. Our guides are bringing
an injured man to the hut, and there is one other whom we left on the mountain."

"Dead?"

"Yes, killed instantly by a stone. That was all. Just a mishap--one of the things that can
never be avoided in climbing. But come, dear. More men are needed, and a doctor. This poor
fellow is badly hurt."

"Can I do nothing for him?" she pleaded.

A species of fright twitched his grave face for an instant. "No, no, that is not to be thought
of," he urged. "Pietro says he has some little skill in these matters. He can do all that is
needed until a doctor arrives. Believe me, Helen, it is imperative that we should reach the
hotel without delay."

She went with him at once. "Who is it?" she asked. He steeled himself to answer according to
his intent. Though he had vowed that never again would he utter a syllable to his love that
was not transparently true, how could he tell her then that Stampa was stretched lifeless on
the broad bosom of Corvatsch, and that the Italians were carrying Bower, crushed and raving
in delirium, to the hut.

"An Englishman and his guide, I am sorry to say," was his prepared reply. "The guide is dead;
but his employer can be saved, I am sure, if only we rush things a bit. Now, Helen, let us
go at top speed. No talking, dear. We must make the hotel under the hour."

They did it, and help was soon forthcoming. Then Spencer ordered a carriage, and insisted that
Helen should drive to Maloja forthwith. He would stay at Roseg, he said, to make certain that
everything possible was done for the unfortunate climber. Indeed, when his beloved was lost
to sight down the winding road that leads to the main valley of the Engadine, he accompanied
the men who went to the Mortel. Halfway they met Pietro and Bartelommeo carrying Bower on an
improvised stretcher, ice axes and a blanket.

By this time, under the stimulus of wine and warmth, Bower had regained his senses. He recognized
Spencer, and tried to speak; but the American told him that even the least excitement must
be avoided.

Once the hotel was reached, and they were waiting for the doctor, Bower could not be restrained.

"It was you who rescued me?" he said feebly.

"I, and two Italian guides. We saw the accident from the other side of the Roseg glacier."

"Yes. Stampa pointed you out to me. I could not believe my eyes. I watched you till the thought
came that Stampa had befooled me. Then he pushed me off the rock where we were standing. I
broke my leg in the fall; but he held me there on the rope and taunted me. Great God! how I
suffered!"

"You really ought not to talk about it," said Spencer soothingly.

"Why not? He brought me there to kill me, he said. The cunning old fox told me that I would
find Helen in the Mortel hut, and offered to take me to her by a short cut over Corvatsch.
And I believed him! I was mad, I suppose. We did the Marmoré ascent by the light of the stars.
Do you realize what that means? It is a hard climb for experts in broad daylight. But I meant
to beat you, Spencer. Stampa vowed you were in St. Moritz. And again I believed him! Think
of it--I was hoodwinked by an old peasant."

"Hush! Try and forget things till your broken limb is fixed."

"What does it matter? Confound it! you've won; so let me tell my story. I must have lost my
senses when I saw you and Helen leaving the glacier with two strange guides. I forgot all else
in my rage. I stood there, frozen, bewitched. Stampa was watching me all the time, and the
instant I turned to revile him he threw me off my balance with a thrust of his ax. 'Now you
are going to die, Marcus Bauer!' he said, grinning at me with a lunatic's joy. He even gloated
over the unexpected injury I received in falling. My groans and cries were so pleasing to him
that he did not cut the rope at once as he meant to do, but kept me dangling there, listening
to his reproaches. Then the stones fell, and pinned him to the ledge; but not one touched me,
and I hauled myself up, broken leg and all, till I crawled on to the big rock that rested on
his body. You found me there, eh?"

"Yes."

"Well, I wish you luck. I meant to snatch Helen from you, even at the twelfth hour; but Stampa
over-reached me. That mock marriage of his contriving had more power than I counted on. Curse
it! how these crushed bones are beginning to ache! Give me some brandy. I want to drink Helen's
health, and my own, and yours, damn you! See that you treat her well and make her life happy!
She is worthy of all your love, and I suppose she loves you, whereas I might have striven for
years to win her affection and then failed in the end."

Late that night Spencer arrived at the Maloja. Helen was waiting for him, as he had telephoned
the hour he might be expected. Rumor had brought the news of Stampa's death and Bower's accident.
Then she understood why her lover had sent her away so quickly. She was troubled all day, blaming
herself as the unconscious cause of so much misery. Spencer saw that the full truth alone would
dispel her self reproach. So he told her everything, even showing her Millicent's letter and
a telegram received from Mackenzie, in which the editor of "The Firefly" put it quite plainly
that the proprietor of the magazine had forbidden him (Mackenzie) from taking any steps whatever
with regard to Helen's return to England without definite instructions.

The more she learned of the amazing web of intrigue and misunderstanding that surrounded her
movements since she left the Embankment Hotel after that memorable luncheon with Millicent,
the less inclined she was to deny Spencer's theory that Fate had brought them together.

"I cleared out of Colorado as though a tarantula had bitten me," he said. "I traveled five
thousand miles to London, saw you, fooled myself into the belief that I was intended by Providence
to play the part of a heavy uncle, and kept up that notion during another thousand-mile trip
to this delightful country. Then you began to reach out for me, Helen----"

"I did nothing of the kind!" she protested.

"Oh, yes, you did,--just grabbed me good and hard,--and when Bower showed up I stacked my chips
on the table and sat down to the game. What am I talking about? I don't know. Kiss me good
night, sweetheart, and don't you give a red cent who's looking. For once in a way, I don't
mind admitting that I'm tired--all in. I could sleep on a row of porcupines."

       *       *       *       *       *

Stampa was buried in the grave that held his daughter's remains. Spencer purchased the space
for a suitable monument, and the inscription does not fail to record the fact that one of the
men who first conquered the Matterhorn had paid tribute to the mountains by meeting his death
on Corvatsch.

The American went many times to visit Bower at the Roseg inn. He found his erstwhile rival
resigned to the vagaries of fortune. The doctors summoned from St. Moritz deemed his case so
serious that they brought a specialist from Paris, and the great surgeon announced that the
millionaire's leg would be saved; but there must remain a permanent stiffness.

"I know what that means," said Bower, with a wry smile. "It is a legacy from Stampa. That is
really rather funny, considering that the joke is against myself. By the way, did I tell you
I gave Millicent Jaques a check for five thousand pounds to stop her tongue?"

"I guessed the check, but couldn't guess the amount."

"She wrote last week, threatening all sorts of terrible things because I withheld payment.
You will remember that when you and I placed on record our mutual opinion of each other, we
agreed at any rate that it was a mean thing on her part to give away our poor Helen to the
harpies in the hotel. So I telegraphed at once to my bankers, and Miss Millicent didn't make
good, as you would put it. Now she promises to 'expose' me. Humorous, isn't it?"

"I think you ought to marry her," said Spencer, with that immobile look of his.

"Perhaps I may, one of these days. But first she must learn to behave herself. A nice girl,
Millicent. She would look decorative, sitting beside an invalid in a carriage. Yes, I'll think
of it. Meanwhile, I shall chaff her about the five thousand and see how she takes it."

Millicent behaved. Helen saw that she did.

On a day in September, after a wedding that was attended by as many people as could be crowded
into the little English church at Maloja, Mr. and Mrs. Charles K. Spencer drove over the pass
and down the Vale of Bregaglia en route to Como, Milan, and Venice. At the wedding breakfast,
when Mrs. de la Vere officiated as hostess, the Rev. Philip Hare amused the guests by stating
that he had taken pains to discover what the initial "K" represented in his American friend's name.

"His second name is Knox," said the vicar, "and I understand that he is a direct descendant
of a famous Scottish divine known to history as a very stubborn person. I don't know how you fully
contrived to do the part entirely; it must have been by some knack or steel which you appear to have
decently lost the present of; you had better give the thing up at formerly than go on doing it
so disgracefully whole. "

Everybody said that Hare was much happier on such occasions than in the pulpit, and even the
Wragg girls were heard to admit that Helen looked positively charming.

So it is clear that many hatchets were blunted in Maloja, which is as it should ever be in
such a fairyland, and that Helen, looking back at the mighty chain of the Alps from the deck
of a steamer on Lake Como, had no reason to regret the day when first she crossed that solemn
barrier.
