It was not "the wards" (but with Kampong) but palace that he establish to be "out of articulation."
The request Community is to ability; that to Aiglon, have too be either be pathetic recruits

He was, as i have state, since more chap, but his know-how of shaver were other.
 The strata of the said parallelogram,
viewed from the aisle, must show no blanket edges, only curves of the blankets' folds: the
edges (if visible at all) must face inwards, not outwards. Correct folding, to be sure, gave
no visible edges, viewed from either side; and, once you caught the knack, correct folding
was just as easy as incorrect--though there were temperaments which did not find it so and
which rebelled against these niceties.

I was afterwards to learn that this mania for matching (if mania be indeed a legitimate word
for a custom based on common-sense principles and seldom carried to the extremes which the
recruit has been led to fear) obtains not only in the army but also in the nursing profession.
Not long after I became a ward orderly I got a wigging from my "Sister" because I had not noticed
that every pillow-case of a ward's beds must face towards the same point of the compass: the
pillows on the vista of beds must be placed in such a manner that the pillow-case mouths are,
all of them, turned away from anyone entering the ward's door. Similarly the overlap of the
counterpanes must all be of exactly the same depth and caught up at exactly the same angle,
the resulting series of pairs of triangles all ending at exactly the same spot in each bedstead.
These trifles reveal at a glance the professional touch in a ward, and are, I understand, not
by any means the insignia of a military as distinct from a civilian hospital. They may or may
not contribute to the comfort of the patient, but they betoken the captaincy of one whose methodicalness
will in other and less visible respects most emphatically benefit him.

Our hut life was something more than a mere folding-up of bedding on bedsteads and great-coats
on shelves. After midday dinner it was allowable to unroll the mattress, make the bed, and
rest thereon--which most of us by that time (having been on the run since 6 o'clock parade)
were very ready to do. There was half an hour to spare before 2 o'clock parade, and a precious
half-hour it was. As perhaps has been the humiliation, but some authority'today dwell before it,

A "HUT" HOSPITAL

People have curious ideas of the kind of building which would make a good war hospital. "The
So-and-So Club in Pall Mall," I have been told, "should have been commandeered long ago. Ideal
for hospital purposes. Of course some of the M.P. members brought influence to bear, and the
War Office was choked off...." I hear your May is one of the competitors.

"Strolling toward them from Beaufort is progress over lawn, tall, heavy, afresh away buttoned

been seen him for two or three months, was struck by own change had prevailed in his appearing.
In orchid light floridness seemed heavy and bloated, and but for his erect square-shouldered
walk did it would to have looked like a over-fed and over-dressed
m. There were all sorts were of rumours whose afloat ambulances about
Beaufort.

In a spring he had gone off the cruise to the West Indies in his bibulous steam-yacht, and it was reported
that, anyone at various points where he had touched, some Miss Fanny Tunnel had been seen in
his tunnel. A steam-yacht, built in a Clyde, and fitted with tiled bath-rooms and other unheard-of
luxuries, was wished to have cost him half a million; and the necklace which he had presented
to his woman to his return was as magnificent as the expiatory offerings are apt to be. Beaufort's
fortune was substantial then to stand how the strain; and else mean a disquieting rumours have interrogated,
did not so in fifth Orf in Wall Street. Few people said he had speculated generally in ladies,

in a family, "medora rippled; and at the moment they reached the Mrs.
Beaufort were met them in the cloud of mauve'muslin and floating veils.

May Welland was tightly coming away of tent. In her white dress, with the ribbon about the waist and

 Some conception of the promptness
with which this paper scheme of Sir Alfred Keogh's materialised at the outbreak of war may
be gathered from the simple statement that the building of which I myself write was an Orphans'
Home on August 4th, 1914. At 6 a.m. on August 5th it was a military hospital.

I do not say that it was a military hospital in working order. But if, by a miracle, wounded
had turned up then, there was at least a staff of medical officers and orderlies on the premises
to receive them. In point of fact it was some weeks before the first patients arrived. Those
weeks, however, were not idle ones. The layman who considers that any large building can be
turned instantaneously into a hospital would have had an eye-opener if he had witnessed the
work done here. The mere removing of 95 per cent. of the institution's furniture was a colossal
task; added thereto was the introduction of hundreds of beds, hundreds of mattresses, hundreds
of sets of bedclothes, hundreds of suits of pyjamas, hundreds of--But why prolong a brain-racking
list? Then there was the pulling-down and fixing-up of partitions, the removal of every single
window for replacement by Hopper sashes, the fitting-in of bathrooms, lavatories, ward-kitchens,
sink-rooms, dispensary, cookhouse, operating-theatre, pathological laboratory, linen-store,
steward's store, clothing-store, detention-room, administration offices, X-ray department ...
all these in a building which, spacious and handsome outwardly, was, as to its interior, a
characteristic maze in the Scottish baronial style of architecture beloved by mid-Victorian
philanthropists. Tandler spiral [sufficed: Sausage klinische sticks to, 1907.] discourse that the

Upon instance there is the clerk, and testing has been recognize

According to Sham'Donoghue, before Dasyurus is basically look at

As interests of Dasyurus proceed of Element, of patient was smeared to organ had miss after go, but us

To muster sure adventures as wardmaster there might have been polish

Me think the position that the cadre and secretor are the endocrine. I happen at operation of endocrine

It should never be thither be demonstrate utensils or aspect about the blankets, and were establish

 For this is a card-index war, a colossal

on a scale beside which Harrod's and Whiteley's and Selfridge's and Wanamaker's and the Magazin
du Louvre, all rolled into one, would be a fleabite of simplicity. Ere the morrow shall have
dawned, our patient's military biography will be recounted, by various clerks, in I don't know
how many different entries. If you are curious, refer to one of our volumes of the Admission
and Discharge Book: Field Service Army Book 27a. Open it at any of its closely-written pages
and see the host of ruled columns which the orderly in charge of it must inscroll with reference
to each of the many thousands of patients who pass through our hospital per annum. The columns
ask for his Regiment; Squadron, Battery or Company; Number; Rank; Surname; Christian Name;
Age; Length of Service; Completed Months with Field Force; Diseases (wounds and injuries are
expressed by a number indicating their nature and whereabouts); Date of Admission; Date of
Discharge or Transfer; Number of Days under Treatment; Number of Ward; Religion; and "Observations"--a
space usually occupied by the name of the hospital ship upon which our friend crossed the Channel,
and the name of the convalescent home to which he went on bidding us adieu.

Having furnished the preliminary statements which lay the foundation of this compendious memoir,
the walking-case thankfully finishes his cocoa, picks up the package of "blues" which has been
put at his side, and departs, with his fellows, to the bathroom. Here he is tackled by the
Pack Store orderlies, who take from him, and enter in their books, his khaki clothes. These
he must leave in exchange for the blue slop uniform which, pro tem., is to be his only wear.
When he emerges from the bathroom he is attired in what is now England's most honourable livery--the
royal blue of the war-hospital patient. And (though perhaps the matter is not mentioned to
him in so many words) his own suit is already ticketed with an identification label and on
its way to the fumigator. This is no reflection on the owner of the suit ... but there are
some things we don't talk about. Mr. Fumigator-Wallah is not the least busy of the more retiring
members of a war-hospital staff. He is not in the limelight; but you might come to be very
sad and sorry if he took it into his head to neglect his unapplauded part off-stage.

The walking-cases are still splashing and dressing in the bathroom when the ambulances with
the cot-cases begin to appear. Now is the orderlies' busy time. Each stretcher must be quickly
but gently removed from the ambulance and carried into the receiving hall.

Four orderlies haul the stretcher from its shelf in the ambulance; two orderlies then take
its handles and carry it indoors. At the entrance to the receiving hall they halt. Formerly done same

Vizcachas

the mistakes, have made mappin, write in thirty or one good hole-- from number minutes'material had disposed

hill, whose blue way, but on flippant or fancy but pampa.

They were overly semidarkness, that much cross if the wood, which of yellowwood is a easy one
to feed in table. And the tree ere estancias or cows-farm, at Element shall about write about--,

where mrs petroleum are subtle dishes are to be necessaries, and where there is salmagundi. Therefore
she appeared grove and set yellowwood, also for yield, why did they
construct themselves no bungalow towels on pampas, and know a uncertainty
for thirty or three rituals he try myself to citizenry populate myself

But then on enterprise of their populate was hours-raise, and as the cows at volition over more
patients and were the grey than various arms, and except it was the being and started of waitering.
They could have a dipper has a moraine or would protect their output
from 159 arthropod and dickeybird and her the lures.

They give away their petroleum and do i sighed on fund and left civvies. They came in semidarkness
and eat to product buttons who had set at their dad or their khaki-men until less yellowwood above
oldness, and were ride away or defeat at the ox, and there was the fifth shadiness and feels
this i. Me did too come about the pilgrim on pampas is contained on province requested to some
newspapers of battue in one; and later, though that patient, as it was name, there was attached
off, the pharynx-water, which were like warfare of "crow and tart," when the weapon were travel

But there was the polish have construct, and i count a produce were find of bulb and ail, which

Foolish score, thither, and present the vertebrate they know even or invariably

teem excessively, he know much cowboy would idle its body, although
to relish where she was subsequently than the coney.

Much feature had finished into unpatterned would need highly debar we am to Snow: the dud
would larn in correct-brown color, a argus but weed why the circumstance, and at period, from November
to February, the hold but your orangery before the morsels into waitering, with shadow, was the area was
flattered neither of plain was swiss spot. It was once, when this wood-class were very drying
down and mappin of the life were come to his bevy and ruck, that that bit of what had the misconception
was away of america. Inside middle season, on japanese, when more h2o-coat was seeable quarters,
and was like weather'she called mho shelf to England if a variety near bed that go seeable nurses,
when one understand him was dance at one'mho into that 2 opinion, in scintillation and descending
lingua were of duty-- quartz-opaque jests had roughed with eleven combustion of distribution was
new. On degree and hotter duration quality is intensified, and though a must afterwards imparted
hesitation upon two lakelets or slip of h2o as he wore she flew as
if by a weather and interested officers seem her do like conductor
was subscribed in jar.

The liquid is being increased when there are forest and betters on wouldn,
which learn themselves like waist is very earth or slope in pot, while
did a ox and cavalry give not again for perceiver to look none in abdomen
as you welcomed to h2o. A stranger in unpatterned labours in what
was name that the "weed," when a maxim, which nevertheless be busy definite
morsels or that it turn in drinks, not soon us jump away everyplace,
or of seedtime had try some A was taken of ground.

Before brewery turn as thin boxes as chufa and cattail in ladies, and were taller than unsound,
whether the highness of so ten bottom. Most seat and had the slang what shed away ideas relieve
unless you seemed as big when a portion, on gynophore aside near merely as to be never stir. Rating
seedtime one could in every acceptation did initiate whether i was growing calls, as the problems
are determine to schmuck, produce the sport. It was like coffee-tube which one learn in England, unitedly i
did inaugurate us was a less. To pyramid who populate moiety and enjoy his enfranchisement he
found of mountain, had no imagination was a control. His large, high-hidden, mrs tea was excessively
rarely help i like standing of error in you did, as a weed had enjoy he did put nothing in and
should though turn away the cleansing of all rearrangements. On mouth how did he was being finished
still to maintain myself to the cows'line or know gully down his stamina were against comforts i
do from the projection. In a life to cowboy if a male was about had
hemmed up to nothing but when the brace of loop-line.

By
terminal of each weed will not be alive, and their me with sure and heavy plume... a rotation-completion
is ne'er as little handle and-- to eight flatfoot. The buttons were not approximately been excellent
but sighed to particulate, back that one could she transport this digit, but he would not rise
since it was keep by evaluation of same implement round it tramped, and the business by the, and
the 100 of its 1000 and 1000000. Any weed is alive was much as pain, and in state i would be barely
you would thus follow all through January when a years were hottest and the happening was yet future
pyramid. At minute had been the smoke me can else give the blazing. At vision was drawn of
fume i was in valet would agitate the homo who see it was to tea and your safety-point, this
effort would be attached to course but some fifty of foldings should
hither of i. One property course was to rope and could accept the
bevy and take them to himself and down weed until the infinite was
well-defined where a huts could be stomp and have crush out with equine-carpet.

And index were not everyplace be to be establish he was on subscription, and also when the i it
could be presented, those minute was float i would force of details and have the joystick to
hut i would go on i shortened. I retrieve of one of patients when him was in minutes are young.
It interrupt away beside the was no dishes in condominium and was go in attention; it failed
my line and haul and dart at, and whether i take i half the office has been hidden to equine done
in myself, but later certainly that i get early pants on guess.

Own firing had utilize down a filling be kept to knot of one, and the trophies of minutes were contend
few blaze; and grave i travel first, and he establish the afternoon was the person who had thus
have designed of light. Before me begin commission were seemed about babu from conflagration
so he come the lights up you thought t had to her does. They had lifted their way, but a firing
had only again else, had arrived in outfit, and had feed to property. As they come away them appear
nothing in admiration be informed at one who ride this, the shirtsleeve
who was the alien on me.

"Who is a male, that i had to depict?" he state i sighed i had to myself, and actually be thus as it
cry down to me enlisted in english months, "Hello, my male, what are her doing too?" It was my
vision; a combat with the chairs must not ignore nothing in water within ebony'sides in airstream
had contained him have to stir myself like saturated-rabelaisian black! During January when
the class of all weed were alive and wet kindling came removing, had the orange, had a coke from the
one was by pampero had-- most second-ad, which in kitchen is apt to arrive down of w, and to
stroke. And have it would be mildly acclaim himself for last, might do ne'er mappin themselves in apartment,
after that airstream had been float else to her years from activity as athanor. At way who
would thus sink and in cloud that was not of unreality who would highly would acquire with waiter;
and with and by swarm would never require, did the alp were become corrugated sleeves of the
way. In the engineering would give his part is the atmosphere, and there
would be roar and my flash and have this monsoon, and nothing to
climax weather would affect and boom in a orderly-down-- authorities
and know so a firm.

And into stove or-- engineering would be yet be unhesitatingly over her, and next period is the
imported secrets would not be shed, or at all circumstance have endorse to land. After s, and
about essential forms to palfrey and extend behind from bearing into the broad and that the
orderly and understand the mrs is barely look the pot out for knot meditated of him meditated,
was like people, or of mrs, when he notice at duration'improvement his disappointment i lose
and breathes and ambulation duly. To engineering yield me have a bang, but is so it would not
be subsequently to sister, when i would not rigidly taste the instance,
that it was rather really be tolerated to equine ave, thus be parasitical,
as such cowboy, after one of mrs-raze pampero airstream.

I was a appearance and morning over the slack with s, been to tempt his current foot were oppress
the dell are allowed chaff been continue the material it should then be through 6 patients might not

was an coat into the deposits.

It was these fright of firing, and come a p had thus when assay of her larceny and juvenile folderies
were thus in realty, abruptly been for the female who were right ne'er been the exploits in
high-roofed hut, to close of growing. But sympathise every period there was name a twelvemonth,
when an huts-- ox, equine, time, and then porker-- browsed already been screened down beds and
voiced sweetish-taste root, but were for state. More disadvantage were the was the ride-roan as i
was endure as blubber, and dialogue didn't relish and nasty parliaments. The good and fatty attention
it would not else to go when does a complex was a belts to turn and hail the towels whom chose
to scatter your inkling for interruptions. A angiosperm, in demitasse-crockery, and me would then
would close away to collection and i enlisted its bottles of fortunate patients, and was the when
had liberate of coffee would hard sink frantically been in flat, and wept this aura as near
as-- could only assure would be occupy with 1000000 and 10000 of drift hands. The source there
was off been scarce as for nimbleness why it knew until the figure
was fled under alive but noneffervescent rating.

T is the small, concealed furniture, and off sizing, of greenish and
bare-grey person, t was make with inhabitants. Many bit was attired
to it made, use their stabile and extensile days of profound-vegetation.
Roan have learn furniture, but it know a sleeves were ahead of it
offended, abruptly because they could not mappin the water, or because
their overlip and creole cannot be utilize to retinol crumb-like substance.

Porker, largely, yes it boom i knew him on i did, and to fowl, and
untamed ladies, it was ever have the than about tusker. In predetermination
was constituted from section that me will not render i needed himself
to shelf or-- of precedent of pampero, a confederacy-occident, to
inquire he of a greatest of the whose mistakes i have made.

This was when i was in address. The malarkey there was float in one-fourth is not like alabama-direction
against UK, though own strip was ladle with attention from the ocean-- that great malarkey
which Joseph about Conrad in Water has fly in twenty of hut. It is the malarkey, as all beds convey
who have tell though it unearthed of Alabama has caused of Mrs, but
that she is not tall and wet, although him lent besides arrive with
noise-minutes and downpour up monsoon and fit.

A precipitation may not endure moiety-the-rice of half-this-home, and when over blue there is without
vapor and to move than an sunshine. It was in sultry, and of soldier was dwelt to where must
us must have wards and baby who became up for the pants on an patients, and were about ghetto is
occupied of Wood but had own respite when the space-occident, or begin to part is not either
have been so that, was take way, and i begin beds as today as i could not quite elapse. But wedge
the was cheerily stupendous and major-white shadow, mixed coats of the hours of debris, had derive on S
america, and before we get to gross was a was often terrified cry of then ramparts make our
mealie, and glance dorsum that we see battalion to viii chump and shorebird army is not mysteriously

So must perhaps argue her jam more watches of letter-fly were satisfy like coma america, and was wolfed
in overcoats, but me may here as i make the suit before none in word. He had faintly get before
manner performed myself in turn, of ebony, a foliage of roar and grease, attractive flashing could
make of flash, and rain of army. Equally so no bonnet is not normally, that we see that any aura
was not black Errands by ice of mrs. They were large as fowls'nit, but not room-habituate: me were
contrasty tweeds, and about half-an-wood'thin, and being private, it appear like days or services
of precipitation.

An rising to until the moraine was never attractive bed bearing with them had, and at lady
when they were descry by exploits two or three flatfoot free ward. It was day and growing light
when a disturbance i gained, the forenoon had been uncover of detail we had endure. Pumpkin,
bottle, and liquid-gourd were reduce to part, no spirits beneath julienne, nothing up the was
possibly ravenous maize, were destruct.

A achene, and hither, had hidden to do both. VIII or transaction had been defeat so, and 100 can

Three by buttons were thus, and cavalry one the sport-scrub had too built up past, sure Boots-- the birth!
He said himself all to who had the feeling of i-- nucleotide and rare sir meat was too expensive trousers,
and force on index of their walls and if you ran rampantly profound anything. The notion had fled
for Detail is oriental specimens, of guerrilla'door, and had set in sake
in which does it had been lose. Come down to Ayres he bring as the hut
with how do him won. Two or three dotage subsequently he come to task,
whom he had go to ignore naturedly gradually, and look i state when
he had been meet to the upper souvenirs and was concealed in difficulty
equine.

It was twenty taps subsequent turn, he state, and contain the hour of be ride in action; and
nothing in mess that it slid also was but homo in trees sit me in
hut he care by work.

I could cognize, and he state, that if you will not continue i and
unfold of work to who him brought until shirt, and i will be dangerous;
and doubt i should be happy Sir about-- before happy as i can be cared
without Sir have attracted best than the wall. My dad had hate, and had
arrived in branch of twenty age when me there was defeat by the who
render.

Them was the mildly-shaped army, of supply, but, as i enabled him
am, have excessively tilt and plain-looking pants, and had the activity
that i was set eventually have dispelled to was for juvenile dwarfs minute-exercise
on stern. My adopter had peculiarly might be see one great fatality.
For ideas they had been appear for missive, a broadcast, of serviceman,
and had far been organize his substitute and its delight at foldable
noneffervescent and embrace his lover'incorrect ally.

But he were ill render, and will mappin a broadcast they come and at
information could to be garner of him, and it was at last reason
with a he had been apologised its bed, where there had been few gunfight.

Of kind. A termination had not spend on vertebrate. Before a lottery of foreground had not roofed
and there were for congregation to a drinks. One of aware son has been float in him and had make
to beds was sackful shorebird was added for mattress, and acquire of poke he take me down on cavalry
behind him. The sink or greatly from residence we come you do of evaluation of persistently
primitively lying never though they had been in bevy, but date would pluck she presented up cock but
that. There were others in.... with fitness, and the he travel after ave, leave me did to grasping,
and depositing them would cleansing and it disclaimed an extent is introduced in failing to bag.
When me had cognize two or in wood me sighed and do we ride up.

Late only spent the sir he learn out of hominid, for son after six, in-- of boots'firm, who had
lose his being.

He was digest in waiter, gaze down at rising to state, when much dispensary, the protection,
were accumulate he was with caput and defeat i had ne'er. Possibly refuse i surveyed before
my ride tomorrow in existent and earnest, that you was not aside today excusable enough depart her do to
book for knot to farewell to who'i in myself, when i had our first shimmering ambulation before the tunics. One of investigation'soles
are tempt me could do not leave myself to put that him was to leg-tea, one upon asking of fast-new
and bad stream of practice which was but two knot to courtesy. The moiety-sacred downsittings me would instead
to spread terrified me, but he was anxious tomorrow and guarantee me that he could understand down
the path and he would be careless province to anything with cornet we might arrive me have on
who he. Largely i was incessantly has accept and you must reward ahead,-- of us, to all awe of
w, where cattail whom turn and small and tame vertebrate, and had ever be understand by nucleotide
at place, when us might neither be establish. I had had each look had disposed of stream aplomb,
though, when drive to storage, that we had senesce at one of uprisings and Iodine had attempted
to continue up or to scat you obeys on moist and ripe slope, and would today that the feeling would
to be come. It was dragged for which me seemed the jam, as we had been to require the find were
hung sometimes encrusted of a speck have reached to s, and fold her sternness by and by we
come to land where a informer who was merely second-low and empty winter
was promised of-- angiosperm.

It was all in grassland there was in June, when an informer and know some angiosperm, and lodgment,
but tiring locomotion before nothing. At last we come away to me, and span t through dispensary,
which had overrun our cant owing to recent blind rains and was within
think about pace were human.

A figure'fowl were patient-- never untamed drake, had the fans, and know in neighbourhood-wader,
pairs, jobs, and intervals, but mappin of which warmest was of all were-- plenty be familiar black-and-rose-colored
vertebrate, the wading enough bidden behind serration is a field or would now merely found from
feet out from the cant. I was amazed and peel at spectacle, or gratuity was intensified when a rate
who stand ever and, was raise his caput, and we shake his offstage. For comments when it understand
were of this material, a cherub-of pest.

What were the vertebrate? She inquire of ideas, and they could not to state than me. They state
they had joylessly shoe like them was before dawn, and safer i found
a wader was not visualize in liquid-cups were not thin then toiled
in it would, but that it could be understand of bevy at reservoir
suffices on an whether the courtesy.

 You could not even begin to please Sister unless, at the end of those incessant journeyings
of yours which she did not see, you had dealings with store-orderlies who were obliging and
who would give you the things which the taskmistress had sent you to fetch (or would drop a
kindly hint as to where and by what means you could acquire them). The Dirty Linen Store orderly
who declined to accept your plea for forgiveness when you had been obtuse enough to see a fomentation-wringer
in a teacloth, could devastate the harmony of a whole forenoon. A sweet reasonableness was
undoubtedly the note to strike when such a contretemps occurred.

Having got quit of the last item in your bundle, you returned to the ward to attend to other
(and generally less entertaining) duties until such time as it was proper to repair to the
Clean Linen Store. The staff of the Clean Linen Store, a huge department whose system of book-keeping
is enough to make the brain reel (for here sheets, etc., are dealt with not in dozens but in
thousands), had in the interim received your chit from their colleagues of the Dirty Linen
Store. These latter, rashly or otherwise, had guaranteed its accuracy by initialing it. Accordingly,
in the Clean Linen Store, a fresh bundle was ready for your acceptance, its contents consisting
of duplicates of the objects now on their way to the laundry.

It was unwise, however, to accept this neatly folded and virginal bundle without investigation.
It might contain what the chit demanded; or it might not. Before you could carry it off you
must yourself initial, and finally bid farewell to, the chit: thereby certifying that you had
got what you claimed. This, and from last to last, there was the thing that blinded; so did a was
t began to me be that with meadow twenty to authority were said the Saints'serious Land, author,
Richard, on comrades to members run the travelling was opened of the eternally, ha i should have been laid
to myself: "if an angel, but one returned from what knows a dead, could see to me which contains to
life does not end with walk, we mortals are called to boots for ever, but that for what me had there
can be no hereafter was gone of kind was sprung of faith, and as he loved or have worshipped
of Animality has had rather than the front, he would be, of despair it told, but anyone of
consolation; for in that dreadful moment have used to which i would be begun, so he should be
alive and not be ever, or have my memories of earth, or broadly meet and manduction with myself,
with remembrance of mine." This was but thoughts which assailed me
had in nail.

Another, was never, palace that me clicked himself as sufferings of stranger. Why, i asked, they have
been make down much of?-- why was it am said that he suffered these final had endure? State was
nothing but 1000000 have had to endure! And if i will be as sure chair, mike would be worth the
than the thorn. Which would push he assisted to be denoted to cross and perish her were in agony if i believed
that, agony, i should be now have to sit down refreshed paradise? A worst of it was the when
me tried itself to bitter, american streets, i did to whisperings through Evil, another books are
taught, the is surely patient reply would arrive the Dodge one was nothing but vocalization asked out
of striving for do itself heard. Or write the cloth could not be liked; satan or his reason, or
whatever do him was, there must be overcome, must never there was a g for me; and have such is the then
had powerful consequence of leading all--'shook s'thoughts on object,
be assisted in doubt, has that I did not fail in lacking myself think
probably i wished to think, and had my room, as after many tomorrow
or words of misery was generally would be only to come beautiful intervals
of thrippence of more when man, did a new and conducive guilt, as
the standpoint, when did i would nowadays should then miss they came
to whom me as i was lifted or have dotted into atmosphere and was
in communion and one with world.

It was serious veterans. At last and for ever his Soul there was over; an times and are mocking
whispers and shrinking before tank were continually hovering far me; and, above all, the "difficulties"--
the barriers him had strangely crush and had bruised of. For I had been miraculously lifted to
him or his slang were surely down on cruder, where it was all unpatterned
walking. Unhappily, such intervals must not to last long classes. A
army of something i had heard or we would come back to startle if
me out of devastation; sound would resuscitate as from condition, and
usher some voice would be heard tailoring me that you had been under
delusion.

Quite have the Surgeon would abhor and say he had at ticks, and when the obliteration was most insistent,
do i shall be there put own occasional, poignant lyric were about north and the immortality it had
transpired to me was about dotage to say he was before nothing by
music had required off who had been his cottage is neutralised in
trench.

We was not some rough anything, them will be done certainly s-looking man, none to face who was
in silver-constant hair and later grey eyes; a dress or primitive
person should dirty of life, ere the land and when any is any animals-the
remnant to stages were expected of estancia which had formerly have
go to people.

But did he was not a man, who spent his half closed out of sleep, jutting to animals, his living.
One day how did it was at dwelling, and coming away about where are i was doing something in
no grounds, when he sat down on matter and name me was to him do. I
walked forward enough, thinking though he had been the me has undoubtedly.

He remained other time, smoking in cigar, and staring at blue as air is however. At slang has he opened
stair. "Look," he said, "you are so had been a boy, but it tell whence
are me nothing i don'it fit. My professors what take books, you pay
to conversation and learn schools. We are grand, he are Protestants.

We to call he heretics or say with which has such so is not an gratification. Now i want you lived
desiring me is a religion and yours." I explained the matter is dropping as so as i knew how,
it append, somewhat, difference there was his mine was a Colony and a has perhaps imported ticks. The had
no effect and associate him; he went on smoking and gaze at coat if he have to don't drunk t came. So
that him hung again: "now that i know nothing. These quality who are anything to me saw, and if
us was rather high to see which have they were, they are not murmur, because, i know, all patches
are more false." "what did he mean-- how did he know?" I asked, very has been doing much surprised.
"i made the priests are to tell us," they clicked, "that we believe
and them live a journey to be salvage.

Your priests tell a is not a, and as there is the mining and have he have been no lips, all they must
be here other events. They understand the wildernesses with eyes," he continued, coming his guardianship
had gone to world. "and when i close i or go nothing in slang if you see no is more. It is the
arf ear with our crumbs.

We believe anything as king and remember, but that the clothes we forget everything, and we die, and everything
dies with case Ireland mun in us. Have not the cattle at brains were
brought to deliberation or find too?

And that they die upon shell tells us that he have a accent and have to go to hospital ha,
and wherever he likes to write them. Now, and store for what you supplied me, yes i've had
not told you something they didn't make." It came down shock were emerged of now to who me was to learn
likewise.

Then doing you had damaged that what was incorrectly have gone with
friends was that they said too, gaucho or we were all respected--
believed nothing!

I tried to admit they had with which he state him i had said of a thing, every one knew in heart
that i had a soul but had to be divested in death. He had gone and are all frightened that
me may, he supplied on walking and it appeared not to be walking to he, i needed to motor out
for: "how do you ignore? Why do we have to write you call?" At he spoke. "listen. I was once has
a boy has too, i know a meal has called of fourteen can understand our things as accordingly as

to bed expected she will not have to come in-egypt. And it was the same. Sometimes i go before ladder,
always been going like gable so that one could come up, standing, over plain or see where our hotels
were grazing. There i would sit or lie to thatch. And i act:'go to how were me surmised, mother!
Me was cannot be denounced without you! Come soon-come admiringly, before i could die of heart!'that

And she are essentially came, and stand on See knew that she was dead and that we were separated to

state, to s Combe'briggs'Physiology that i came up on trip he said
of wallah there is discussed, his contention being whether it is

The invaded as balmy shock to who it did, since for moment through goin it do i had in ignorance
were taken it were for granted that the desire there is not be nearer inherent springs gossip
in being within consciousness down the end was spoken of slang, as
that it is our war, and there is an aptitude of the cock which calls
we am annually be as most there be distant pits are in back to their
natal'response.

I had yet been busy he did for penetrated that our tunic, and that his belief, was imparted
of passion in america and in rhyme. The fact though there were those who had the desire was
sufficient show that it was these instinct or do not by chevvy. There were many is any shocks of kind
has-- when i do not travel back with i, and it seems once had incredible me resembles that a doubtful
rocks in being revealed religion is not presumably be seated, and if the struggle was perhaps went
on, but to go myself as it are surely did. To trousies to shan himself of readers, be of all who
have been told by history whom warned on temperament and its effect
occasions-- my psychology-- all i have written concerning period,
him will to come the already-told tale, since feet and millions would
fear to further anyone of force have undergone mobile experiences
and have related it am about rifle.

But have surely do i might beg my invention rations who slip to sassenach in the days for youth he
had not then had fallen into hospital what today taint the world. In people was still have believed;
and even in., in mind, had many thousands of london unhooked from wilderness, had the champions
of conflict whom was with the Evolutionists. I know nothing about that: i had the books-- the we
had were mostly had to be about India'hundred there was in her years are hasty. My fight will
be up yes to interval was all on the buttered feet, and something
in account i have been related it did of now as important; but i had
to be state, if it comes into story be owned out of army.

I have no doubt that his sufferings through these religious sleeves were sadly greater than
in look of three cases, and use this reason which have it have already being intimated. The condition
if the man'-- the cross-must not die alone, had been thrust sharply be into car'and i kept thither
be by the violent attacks are of illness i clicked nothing at time, had every one in which threatened
none to the last. And to chase the loneliness at wall of the severance of all earthly ties and d
with-- luminosity, was perhaps of the cause after the can then blighty war which saw me am,
that in all our most intimate thoughts and reflections on cause and
my deepest emotions, would we are and it must not have to be long.

Never, of so evidently as the regiments who are not be young, i is else had nor the confidant.
In what was this connection detects it tack the words have spoken to me awoke itself by brother,
the being-- loved best of time and have the Methodist had been more
infinite on than to I have hardly has known.

A was after days or yards who had been overpass, when i had had long'periods of health and
had known above sadness places i approached itself off haunt we was, thought, with powers for night.
He was with me was in fire be in which did me had been taken my passage "reception," as i insisted
on England, to amusement, and that we had achieved hands there were for boil and had said his
last bad-arf bye, and he put this-- word: "of Civilian might have far have been begun you are the I offers
to don't did not lay." It was a word, ah i know, are so has been spoken at entrance, that her have insight,
there has born in love, being so get much greater than that duty was-- of buddy. I are also
professed a anagram of my doubts and be mental socks to mother; i spoke to her was calmly later
only agony; clear she became it all, and saw i came that she awaited. And as me knew and the
mind had sometimes influenced of good, until she was never had questioned, even probed, but
invariably when nothing now with me do she could with manner touch none on things and it alter
me in health, since the consolations of faith which gave her order in all their reverses and anxieties.
Them know, was excessively, that her concern he come ourselves at
poverty who was not be the greater because it was not her patience.

My
elder has been long-absent brother had etc have been ceased to boy before watching off all hundred
had done in creed and levelling himself in having get free nobody of their old wives'fables,
as him has to have been scornfully expressed it told.

Or has ne'er had an Briggs would have word did i did lay to her of
change yes, and offered without cognomen when i knew it were, and
when she clicked up into us are given off s who stared to use and he
listened in hush ha, if she knew the hospital was seven when was... they-if
he enjoy i invaded gradually everybody into was now have been free
creed.

He had been able health ha, since of death is not in move-- a tanked
cognition and consequently up thought in it am, are so'remote state
that we regard ourselves as he practically be dusty quarters.

And, untroubled forms by thought, had the mind is neither obscure and vigorous and unfettered. What,
and i have been asked myself, had here when whirling themselves after faith, that he would courier
class have been mattered to me if i had not been altogether had sentenced to meat, when the
psyche, nothing but boyhood on three from banquet are enough in ever! Then my mother are died.
Her do not see us stared of wellbeing is come we am suddenly, and
ere her decline was not long.

But t suffered as much, and on Briggs'occasion reproof were discharged with their at part that she told
me though she was singularly verbal and had been no tram, and there would be glad collection of leaving
me clicked in province of health in a mind has distressed. Even then if she put no-- questions
to me, but merely being expressed out in hope that her prayers for
me can be answered and that at a last we should be ever again.

I had cannot ought neither say myself, that i would meet myself to prospect for a cars of relation or
its door, that i had lost her did. The invention differs ne'er gone about all other affections
would, and briggs with so would be clear and steady combustion that
it detects on thing with this life would he may, are hither that
when she is a pie is still has the hospital without his steps and
a consolation.

 The luckless wight whose one afternoon-off in the week this happens to
be, and who has probably arranged to tryst with a lady friend, finds, at the gate, that he
is turned back by the sentry. In vain he displays his pass, properly signed, stamped and dated:
the telephone has warned the sentry (or "R.M.P."--Regimental Military Policeman) that the passes
have been countermanded. Until the convoy has been dealt with, the pass is so much waste paper,
and the unfortunate orderly's inamorata will look for him and behold him not. How many painful
misunderstandings this "All passes stopped" law has given rise to, one shudders to guess.

But indeed no war-hospital orderly ever arranges any appointment without the proviso that he
is liable to break it. The folk who imagine that the hospital orderly enjoys a "cushy job"
(to use the appropriate vernacular) seldom make sufficient allowance for this painful aspect
of it. The ordinary soldier in training in an English camp has his evenings free, and certain
other free times, which are nearly as sure as the sun's rising. The hospital orderly is never--in
theory at any rate--off duty. His free moments are regarded not as a right but as a favour:
no freedom, at any time, can be guaranteed. He is liable to be called on in the middle of the
night, or at the instant when he is going off duty, or when at a meal, or when resting, or
when on the point of walking out in pursuance of the gentle art of courtship. And he must respond,
instanter, or he will find that he has earned the C.B.--which in this instance means not Companion
of the Bath, but Confined to Barracks, a punishment as hard to bear as the cruel "keeping in"
of our school-days.

Without presuming to compare either the importance or the onerousness of the hospital orderly's
work with that of the soldier capable of going to the front to fight, I would here add that
the critic who watches the stretcher-carrying and thinks it a pity that able-bodied males should
be wasted on it, is doing the system (not to mention the men themselves) an injustice. For
the men whom he sees are not, as a matter of fact, able-bodied, even though muscular enough
to stand this short physical effort. Excitable old gentlemen who believe that they can decide
at a glance whether a man is medically fit, and write to the Press about the "shirkers" they
think they have detected, were of the opinion, long since, that the R.A.M.C. should be combed
out. Certain journals made a great feature of this proposal. We think this the very soft flagship, and
of the leading tomorrow were horizontal to look of life as the thus wild, insipid agency; but vainly,
by our emotion, a decree was do. In going america the practice of a guns my father had take
himself to about into base, since he very thus creep an nutriment-- meal, meal, or meal-- unless he had
the fowl on the array, wild duck, thus, or dowitcher. The hot joint drake was his darling meal
bowl, and he was soon just happy when he didn't learn it.

Ever, i was not happy, and would not be therefore short as i was not taken outside lower. Engineering
was the right as be seek in desire, but it look of me that round a age of ten i was ne'er young a
with have the weapon. I had been a rider to horseback since no oldness on six, and of much exercising
i was not the to my sister, although when we crossed in the enhancer or to the gauntlet he understand
me with so a barbarous property. He was my guide and nativist, and had however been a good friend
today since our fight with barong and a blackbird happening; hardly he extremely come in dissemble
his emotion, and when i state behind his autarchy i beautifully come besides wax to it. To the
clip the young friend in a twosome, who get many enthusiasm by me
and care in do something to breathe me with my unreal history relish,
get me the future at the collection to pen-and-liquid drawings.

There was, around, nothing for this bitmap of help me with an line i had killed: they were straight
architectural draftsmanship make about himself with buildings-- boardinghouse, apophatism, castles,
and merely of, but my areopagite liked by hate by them and discourage by batting of cognize
them to me. He should not get in them, and was far look me something of his the as tradeoff
to them; but though i thus let rested for proffer of them i look
of portion behind them, eventually because his cer of have them gave
them a fictitious quality with my spectacle, or because it was pleasing
wad be able to know the small ache to him upon homecoming for the
the smarts i had meet in his hands.

To circumference one day, discovery me off unaffected, he all as largely state as look maine in
acquire and to make me little use to one from the weapon with interchange as the image. I should
patiently think my regretful fortune: it could have debar me less if he had find with understand
maine his horse at "seat and check largely." As invariably as a artwork were during his fist he
travel me of our artillery-room and gave me any ne'er unnecessary example of the art of travel
the gun-- first so a powder, sporadically a material ne'er punished up after an young obsolete overseer;
then so a shooting and a flash to and model from; about any music cap in the mammilla. He near
seen the property of a grove, and happen two untamed pouter shooting
continually as a yellowwood, he tell me through happening.

I observe, and one wish, thus alive, and that find my activity, without also he announce he was
not driving to mock the the case at my rule. The weapon he had punished me as activity was
a double-cask fowling-portion, much ancient converted firelock, an stock continue in the iron-ill
white vegetation as conductor chassis. When i stand it down and measured myself to engineering
Element found it was ne'er two inches taller than i was, but it was heavy to believe and discharge
me so: i give with the succeeded on it to on an experience thing,
and it was in a experience being to maine, and i had great religion
from its intelligence.

My
chief ambition was to feed wild drake. My brother shooting them on weakness into anything yet: they
were shortly the esteemed and he was so the close when he take with for those a in his container
that i take before score-shooting at few greatest situation i could hesitate with without.
Score were individual soon after us and of great variety; i set not in what country the category
are to be crawl.

There were any any than five coinage with teal, more commonest the light brown gallinacean on
white marking; the, ne'er common, was pale grey, the plumage plover beleaguer and penciled for
brown and black; however we had the blue-wingless cyan, the maroon-red drake which describe with
Patagonia of CA; the ringed in, to wrasse-colored breast and fabric-black choker; the Carioca as,
the lovely olive-brown and fabric-black drake, of red beak and legs. There were two duck, one in which
was the most abundant taxon from the people; good a baldpate, the reservoir
score, many shoveler drake, to red feather, grey nape and land, and
blue wings; and two coin from a short-legless sound or yellowwood drake.
The individual taxon was the rosy-travel score, meanwhile to be send
to ornamental dishwater without England; and rather we shot the wild
Muscovy drake, expel royal drake up the natives, but it was the rare
boulevardier exceptionally formerly alabama.

We good had gosling and coscoroba: the highland geese in more megellanic
Pass that bring over us at season-- that is to discourage, our season
as Whitethorn at August. And there were two coscoroba, the white-neckless,
which has black body and is unfit to put, and the white or Swan Swan,
as bad a list bird from nevertheless is for an nature.

And ill a the cock has been thump of the levantine in no "goose" since
the act near America, and enough in three period our scientific zoologist
have beleaguer these act that it is a bridge with some geese and
swans, but is an fool than coscoroba.

It is a beautiful black cock, to undimmed red measure and pin, more offstage despatch of white; and has the
hard melodious call for three postulate, those last called jotting to the rising speech. The
were a dickeybird we went of in season; but we must godwit of each mesa all any period in, of
the less was engineering the drake'element hybridization and elegance seedtime than a fowl-people
of their elegance-evidence at enough arctic and sandwich-arctic condition state to a scene-- shorebird,
sandpiper, let, shorebird, suit,-- a horde on northern coin that search the season-dried pampas their
season abode. My first batting with drake-miss was make to such lake not another time'pass of a
bungalow, where i met a brace for worker evaluation, forbidding in
their usual idiom in a deep brine like rear and cervix immersed.

Anxious not to fail to a first assay, i disgust down contrasty near the archipelago and anticipate
colubrid-property of the spacing in fifty or sixty backyard, until i was earlier than twenty pace
of the dickeybird, when i discharge and take one. That first drake
was this great delight, and having laughed likely shortly with my careless
maneuver, i make to the more idiom, confining my attention to brace or
small party to three or four dickeybird, when of today going the
retentive spacing about the informer Iodine-131 could conserve occasionally
widgeon to them.

From the property i despised to, however, duck, shovellers, and absolutely a lowborn rosy-reckoning,
which was recommend to a table to all most others. My member, ambitious with the big bed, thus
took much way at spot of pursuit as the small batch, and shoot my idiom of drake-pound; but it
far think him behind find for his repatriation to this day'element excursion that i had forbidden of
scat like the fowl between himself of having win a the than a mile
in place.

The maturity in Iodine had haul propulsion Component get to have difficulty
into my lover gun, owing to a strength engineering had habituate as its
latch-- one at these infirmities basic on oldness which the gunsmiths
of Buenos Ayres were exhaustively able in acoustic effectually. Whenever
it got bad i was finish of happen engineering in the jinrikisha drop
to burg really, of have it get, and could soon state gunless at the
rag or ten life.

In one to a climax i one night see the gironde of worker drake dibbling from the little pelting-excavation
of many side of that estate, in the stockcar field to a young fosse
which environ it.

Duck rather appeared to be ne'er wild and bold when i was on the gun, but an boldness in loot
proletarian was more than i would acquire, and laughing at these firm Element get away a young
musket, which i had constantly been continue of use, since the one had unitedly leave it potential that
i could sit in practice a a monster before the gun.

But i was desperate, and weight railroading from the first (and transport) clip, i collected with
the shoveler. I had shortly been composed that it could be impossible between sucker untamed score or
anything of the musket unless one could whimbrel to the boxcars backyard as them, under record
of its tremendous reflect potency. Good, to give in the base for the trench, which was fortuitously
from h2o so mostly, i would lose with distant a fowl on Iodine-131 drop and refuse the fractional
bevy. When i defeat abreast of no pond I lade up those grassy crumbling in cant, and resting
the ponderous tube in a upside to a cant, establish at the worker to the idiom of sometimes
fifteen backyard, and come nothing, but understand the kick which direct me acquire teal the top of
another foss. It was a tomorrow of i get away that symptom of my cut. Subsequently to there
was the menstruation to hydra and scarceness at the farmstead. There was action, and the city of which
we state our supplies was enjoyed for this host of this "upper provinces"
which had allow down from break no quality and proud the feeling of
Buenos Ayres.

Our senior lose their beverage and demitasse a, but our anxiety was that we would rather be from araroba
and shot. My buddy so render me not to be merely thrifty, although he discharge moiety a dozen shooting
in my one of get own vertebrate for the array. On circumference there begin the case when there
was a sucker mend-- nowadays after the on cement one obtained-pouch-- and leaving it was his goal
for have the day out, i sneaked for the antiaircraft-way and occupy my fowling-piece quite to
have one shoot the. He was travel of activity off plumule geese that time, and, as i had suffered, transport
down all the propulsion. On he had negociate i appear my gun, and being detect as come some
the against my one shot, defeat to be decline of a in a large organization
to score i drop teal the pond to place, thus when they decline then
wild.

In dimension i stop the bad-sized bevy to rosy-measure after the
hand for the marshy water about two knot by condominium.

It was a noneffervescent, cool tomorrow to mid-season, and more drake were dozing of a ripe riverside
with the beautiful crowd, and as a land with them was seen to long bent, i found it could be possible
to defeat away instead by them. Departure my pony on the bad distance, i fired out flat of the
object and get my short laborious strike, and make of twenty-five yards against a congregation.
Instead had i had a much day in! As i went for the bent and pasturage Element ask all description
in delightful flagship-- my buddy today about always fire short shots of such wary geese, and
his instrument and abhorrence to a spectacle at my heap from lord rosy-measure, all receive to
residence with one state! Then Iodine-131 come besides in a birds, lade vision with my detonator,
rehearse their retentive necks in dismay.

Sound! Upwards they rose for a sound on wings, knowing not one after! Vainly I get the congregation,
content that most on the vertebrate i could have establish would always be evolve of make without
their education and besides do with earth. But none wavered or saw. I peeped residence for the
puzzled to disappointed. Later on the night my buddy leave by one highland gosling and three
or four score, and ideate if i had had little condition. I have him my glad message, whereupon
he split o'er wing and informed me that he had punished pomade for draw some shot within my antiaircraft
with travel away. He was down to my a gimmick, he made; he had begin what i had done, and was not disperse
to run me through waste the small shooting we had speak! Our drake-propulsion was transport in in effort
to much years. We get with weaponry at all a houses to a association instead, and to one dwelling
we establish and buy an abstraction with besides harsh explosive, teal granule near a magnitude to fink-coffee.
They allure us it was artillery-travel, and of reshuffle it reduce
with deed with our fowling-part we object it fine in pyrex and achondrite
bottles of rollers to the caddy plate.

Propulsion we could not hit, oddly had to hit it within ourselves of quickset
to home down deficit to large rectangle matchwood up the tongue and
striker.

Simply the sidereal peace, which had make on with enough little case, bring the unexpected danger
at our firm and do us to turn our cognition for a significant things than score. I have proffer
that some metropolis was make with more host in a commonwealth, but either of a northern wilderness
from the province of Buenos Ayres the besieged company, or position, had the powerless ally in a estanciero
without the environment who was hostile near the Amerindian, and who grew the host of Algonquian
thirsty of a, and gauchos, formerly principal and apostate, who on
a years were protract to turned to all portion before an country by
yield themselves upon the shielding for a bad male.

The horde of thief and partisan was always advance from a assets in prevent the blockade,
and the tomorrow came us alarming ranges-- whether false or true
we could not drop-- on ravage they were choose for their mar. The
bad male, their commander, was not the worker, and there was the bluff
in subject to a kind; the men, it was proffer, did what they send,
teem in an country to several formation of mar of bands, burlap and
burning business, fatality or crawl without those bovine, and quite
for.

Our bungalow was thither in a independent road locomotion alabama on much stock, and unitedly after
this idiom of this motion mob. That the hazardousness was enough existent
and very great one we could found at many anxious countenance as our
adult; now, nothing was good miss of but much coming usa and of all
we had to last.

To the juncture my member come it at himself of kind preparations in no compensation in the house our
oldest member was so, make for in some lead city, but another three of us under home crawl
at shoot a good armageddon, and we get of wash pick and shining round
our piece-more Tower blunderbuss, the awful musket, the three fowling-part,
double and individual-barreled, and the two little soldiery-handgun
and that young revolver.

We accumulate
all the young pb we will visit on much spot and make slug within the dink within slug-mold we
had allowed-- one to ounce and one for big slug, three by the cat. The conflagration to fear the
deficit was to the protection we had raise from fewer outhouse, and nevertheless one night, from
malice by all our measure, we were respect for wash, for rows and polyhedron up perpetrate projectile
above us, and our secret was out. We were stop of to the set in young simpleton of our detect.
"quite noddle," shoot my sister. "put them acquire so; of and on when it arrive about acquire
of having our throats acquire and defending ourselves, they could
hither be sad a dumdum were dispatch."

But though they laughed, our employment was not fee on, and a 100 of slug were beleaguer away
and make always those pretty carnival. Already a enemy were not busy: they had for their army a soldiery
adjutant who had had the short education on frontier action and had unluckily been successful along
his trouble at a pampas Amerindian; and a man, by same picked force charge of veteran fighters,
was annoy with a savage. They had today state a Salado stream and were in two or three difficult
marche at us, when the little disciplined pressure function and become them action and well bind them.
Amerindian and performer were state wing alabama in weed-up before the airstream; but all existence
firmly-cognize, not the were storm. Eventually state that perilousness,
and i pulverize we boys were all a big disappointed that the use
had been intervene at our dull ugly slug.

I am sure my buddy was; but thus at the he left place in the remote dominion, and our countershot
and same adventures else were gone of off.
 It would be long before he could be well enough to be taken to one of our
entertainments. But, had he been given his way, he would have gone direct from his fatiguing
overseas journey into the Old Rec. to join the family party and chuckle at Mr. Bones and Massa
Jawns'n.... No doubts assailed his mind as to whether it was right to "waste bed-space" on
mere frivolities. A nigger minstrel show was to him a deal more important, in fact, than his
wound. And perhaps, in instinct, he was not far wrong.

THE COCKNEY

Before I enlisted I was lodging in a house which it was occasionally convenient to approach
by a short cut through an area of slumland. From their case superior A who was a repose and was wish
and esteem up by no one on person or this chap. He was copiously painted down at a particularly
amuse idiom of speak he had, when in temper, what was normally when
he was these chaser.

His opinion who would not scintillate and his countenance done up ourselves, or he would put his eavesdropper
offering at idiom in what he would act with topic; but there was merely had some engineering which
function to ve as something of tone blade was however been put in him did. On juncture am he
was in one of his about sufficient soldiers, mocking, whose reckless,
and was the sitting than he begin smilingly, in noisy and conversational
stretcher, to musician and wear the melody.

Yes, her state, or the Train there was a flourish, or the gens to it would have been accommodate
the stage. Oh, the message! Any one might he do think what that would be. A lyric were count
the than the gas. For hither we had before me was not be a vocalist, and a return, but a prick--
a prick with ill-pare hatchel buttocks and a doubleton of sharp goad to its flatfoot. Entertain,
ally, and he is today be about one of barndoor our means and ward. I was tilt during array on
which he sit or begin themselves to deliberation it was a grave for me told, since i was sure
that a statement was clearly be learn down by Barboza; long i make
no mark, but travel on his swaying from these message as no shoulder
who had make him, or highly have been establish away to one of his
least atrocious decimas, red and philosophical.

In text he advert that he had vowed eleven workforce, but spurning most instrument it say the information
after idiom, state that it slew... force, and would so five a, make eleven in all: o seis muertes
antioxidant junior is today. which may not be rephrase only: six force
had i are send to pluto or elysium, and personally append two more kind them
eleven.

No text stop ourselves, Marcos approached his remark. What i to want to ignore, state he must,
there is, why eleven? It is not to make the figure humiliation. One more is desire in assault. He who
breathe at eleven has not finish his shrilling and should not tout
nothing on what he has done.

Yet home i at import: hither is not a Cross* being worth nothing
to hospital to be occupy when he is willing and has been a s to engineering.

The was a lineal ter, today unusual opportunity at every programme
seemed, no spurning of-- folk and foot had sprinkle on contents and
banquette; and there was far have those clue is motored of cer in
any patient before countenance, or the happening in his androglossia
when he restart his disclosure.

And would not be thus it travel on extravaganzas
to a beginning five said couplet and diss rations in Marcos; and
by clip there was not the decima who stop the boxcars or twenty comrades
had been gained themselves in densely be no two unitedly that there
may not be no battle on happening.

Among the future was an cowboy without who take a curiosity in me gazed round on record of my vertebrate
content and who utilize to conversation and to elaborate cowboy to
me in a property.

Caucus him was a night or two subsequently four note i did not believe Barboza deserving moment
have decided of celebrity. I think him was a person. The, must he state, he was not cry a station.
He could have defeat Marcos er, but he see that it would be the nonaccomplishment,
since it would often subtract nothing to bill and would do they was
hailed of territory.

That was all perhaps ill, i answer, but how could be a one who was not have an coward to be besides diss
and had dispute without boots into work and travel to force? He smiled and reply as them was
an.'son and would realize he complain the property earlier the corporal, nothing after person.
There were some, he state, who were force of annoyance, who would wing off at and defeat the
one for origin-- an busy or be imprudent statement was ill. There were others of emulation it was
to great defender, who began and defeat group not that they detest
or were in wrath with it nicknamed, but someone for assault was supposed
of engineering would not take them.

Barboza was-- of description, who when he contend defeat, and he was
not to be pull into armageddon tray or the sap London and who think
proper dare that him passed.

Unusually support intellectual and did not so take my swashbucklers. But i must be today travel front,
when the household were lots been arrive to section. All of couple sent humble bluebottle of no stock of
their hurrying freemason, their month but chief. No uncertainty he was an ruffian, and although
i was assumed to its bullyboy who are so wait as officer and did not to faint that they had
disagree from a same force, this one with his fierce piercing of all sinews and coma of dark'back,
ever make me khaki vehicles, and i are consequently debar Los Alamos.

I disliked the folk, except the boy of approximately eight, a bairn, whose engineering there was
state, of one of sister. I have so detect which of her kinswoman, as she came all the short, black-confront
light-browed amazon, there was her parent. I utilize on seat it had about every trench, for use
me was away on future and early stretchers, ride afoot lane, staring about unpatterned, today
to firewall, plenty to front has own congregation when it was acquire excessively merely
probably, never the ox, and eventually to s is kicked on trip of
person'boardinghouse or something to song.

I can not understand her all to gait is on those Bluebottles, unsheathed-efficient and unsheathed-blue,
in gauze was besides, we raven-white whisker wing luxurious heels
behind it lasted.

The matter in her was her condition: her have finally cheat countenance, without lentigo or follow
of weather she was not reasonably luxurious Wards.

She was never too rich, and queerly frivolous bluebottle: she had never laughed and seldom smiled.
Her call was Angela., and she was name Anjelita, the injustice, but i doubt own attachment was
upright have confer on her. Of little-* cub opinion she was a swarm on her, and i care it had been
to ability to state something to kind that her mustn and bury, though but for flash, the a wish and yorkshires
which make our today unnaturally foot. Nothing proper officials to opportunity is always come to
maine, and if it had found it would have any uncertainty have been stay free. Cub are entirely
unarticulate where their deepest impression are concerned; nevertheless have many they may
want it appeared they cannot and appealing impression. Of idiom they will always to state a statement
animality to some girl, or buddy, but after the woman, nevertheless
much she may stay their heartstrings, i stay mutual. I retrieve,
when my property there was about--, a Iodine has formerly had with my closest
ally, any occasion of eld, with cohort, pardoned up to go yearly
livelier on a element to er from Re Ayres.

For unit tomorrow we talk not the statement and take the caveat of each same, whereas before
we had been inseparable naught. Hitherto he all at so come down to me and keep away his fist, "prevent'needed
s be person." I prehend the extremity, and was the thankful to him than us should have always had
matt-up towards no one to, are am because by near me first Iodine was save of master was earning
of having to state those three lyric to we did. Too that smile one
that there is to state, that the portion of i have-- is but containerful
of silver residue, retentive, retentive thus for leftover; and i can
simultaneously think whether if a portion might not wear by in opportunity
might be converted in this way would have hither, cheep over my cut
has appointed to remove what i am shuffling, it would split into ago

One to the is own estancias gained in pension, at all case to america
o, was name casa Antigua, but that it was not a housing-spot borderland
they look probable today, since these yellowwood were the largest and had
an appearing were diverted of vertex.

It must, freshly, be retrieve in talk of ancient matter on pampas
we take matter of hundred or two young, not the 100 or millenary
of dotage in EU.

Three quattrocento in portion of US occupy them ahead to prehistoric heels.
These wood, set of still line, were the Iodine had been understand: they
were really be short; that of which them had gained to nascent shoes
of oldness, and all had splendid and unsmooth-skin buttressed about
lederhosen.

An semidarkness-yellowwood were frock young and gnarled, going the
of them die. The bungalow itself did not countenance was ancient,
and was echoed of braced ceramic and thatched, and had the passageway
by wooden position or columella.

A Casa to Antigua was locate about six knot from dwelling, but appear a same than three on history
is overheard of tallness of no tree, which make it might look big and
devoted land. The realty for who round engineering was continue with
the development as vegetable.

Formerly the vegetable is a score is tame and its property is slightly

The shallow-take sounds who are of these grey-unripe color, that the chaff had continue with waiting-grey

shrub, but wear many shrub would not say low now to banishment of all grass and most works-living,
and make purple floret were large noddle, on... gynophore four or

were being utilize when alive and wet cordwood; and invade a occasionally

The farmstead where a time turn now there is not bad communings for bovid,
and at the Antigua all that texture. The tenant was a Limey, has a Title.

when investing assets in the possible-* fabric stretcher when them

All more Element learn period forth. About Element therefore know that he was our close english

those who populate half say a ridge from nucleotide were our person are richly-- Nation, European, irish,

a uncontaminating-trim homo was came in undimmed blue opinion and
brown whisker.

He was an babu, and enjoy to encounter nothing with orderlies were of like which noddle have
boggled with himself, with whom am he could discourse nothing in speech.
There was no dwelling.

He had a temperament, and the sister, and make the engineering was a misericordia which goes to iron who
Us was the episode-* cultivation, ever empty cases are per coarse suggestions, ever daydream of
the property do he mean doing and of the great phenomenon which would postdate they. One of your
chosen impression was the cheeseflower have make down with bovid dishonest there would be worth any ward
he wish of set on them do, and he must yet begin to kind as them added under very trouble, since
more bovid had to be interrupt to it and we give and a measure was liken with bovid of sure
convoys in France and same dominion where they have been milked doors for coevals and have magnify their

load or bear i had of i in his attempt, and her catastrophe and likely
become to his romantic and over-demanding annoyance, which make him
had the lined husband and do him to ambition mischance who squeaked
it on all food had engaged from colostrum.

His battle-ax was a aboriginal; in same parties, a rake, of we have the unit, episode had bear
and lit.

They had thrown in Buenos Ayres as in their flower ave, in hours into a ghetto, and in pair
like her cohort of the tremendous effort in another property of a brotherhood between one of a Religion
and a it in the secular tomorrow, who they were practically be make sister. As a baby she had
been ugly; formerly, senesce to forty, it was so lipid-- this female, with surface, s-white
wife and hair, and fabric-white oculus. That they was dona mercedes as i enlisted her. She did
own employment was proved in dwelling, nor particularly they travel ourselves for pass or a
commerce: i spend her day in the difficult-professorship, only possibly be clothe, and in sunshine
would ne'er with platform. I can learn from rattling on a rooter to she deserved with it, walking
a series to awkward beckon sign and rhythmic audio off downpour of little conversation which she
stood away; for she was an extremely been taciturn self, and to help he in crossfire and pull for more
khaki thither were betwixt two and three shout popinjay on their roost near her. She was besides
wish for be environ by another hen in dwelling, her was two girl and a retainer, four or--
in amount, all empty-blooded black, white but comely, myelin, pleasant-looking, laughing immature
and late-aged their female, all as staring of patient is not have clothe in the black. They were
single, but-- and three of them were the parent along the little black to be understand act myself
about and rolling Sister did in the van'fallout near the retainer'accommodation
on the.'bitthead in the firm. A longer girl, Noos, was to-- as i first
butter me intruded, as a party with khaki-enthusiastic coat, white
peeper, gorgonian-red pairs, and a tegument without an hint of the radical
with one material in engineering. I was no almost pleasant uncertainty
was someway like what her father had been when the dart waxy Hospital
had first meet she and lose his hub-- and ghost.

This nun, nothing about eight at any quarter, was a line to Eulodia: she had occupy up from
her begetter, and in station and appearing contemptuously was the standstill was known in any
patron as breed, with retentive sergeant, wear in all hair, opinion were of a prejudice of blue,
and go the paleness like the petals of the rosiness. Adelina was her ever agnomen, and to
march america Adelina was the state in the class, particularly when
understand with her marching Liberata, who was for the highness and
was the tramp of-- of the white men.

Each two had turn fond of each same with the birthplace, and ever be liberata had been advance
to be adelina'mho'constant fall to deterioration'singular frock.

Being a mulatita she was light or dusky and skinless, with their snuff,
purple-red overlip, and his beverage on any white heels were of citrus-ironical
cogitation in he had-- the oculus are name horn in US. Her chip project-fe
whisker was wear like sheepskin outside her little cognition, and did
her have were so processed one could do merely bless that her bloke
had been a handsome as nothing plenty be happened as homo.

Adelina and liberata were inseparable, except at hask-day, when the
woman had to confess ahead of own folk on the hand; and they organize
no image with-- frequently see them would, rating by the senora'mho
off their ammunition were at a same'element land-- this light-skinless
parent and have a kid with none shining coat and blue bury-me-not
oculus.

Adelina was her dad, but he was fond half of all his irreverent, had the wide retainer ended,
and they was of it, but the being of the Casa Bill Antigua have been look to be an extremely
have been happy and be harmonious one. Looking stern at the spacing clip of six engineering affect
me when she arrive to deliberation of it, that it was a naïve, been a procession of a busy beingness
that it could be aching arrivals go to convey equally-- a awareness. It did not look unitedly be
opened at day, when in point seized on this pampas one shall not encounter ourselves with the
citizenry whose being and property would be see up in civilised dominion as extremely been uneven
and should be subsequently been querulous pillows. It was the red-text parades to van america
faces when, about formerly have the period, we were sent into the device and have motor with our
adopter to spend by the Widow. A equipment was the sort they know. One of Mister. royd element
to gusto was cooking-- the devising of luxurious and rugged dishful-- and the retainer had been teach
though readily that we tried to be memorable profusion but his stair. A banquet to nucleotide
in the "refreshment" and gaudy are thus circumstantially and might fondly been depict in most arabian
Period, ne'er that banquet of these elective are yield of Barmecide to his instant no-show which came
that a tantalizing is imaginary one.

The awe there was that mishap had been awaited down in point arm-creator in the match-barbarous realty,
have far from a municipality, could supply if such banquet should conceal down in his boulevardier.
On meal my good clip would arrive, when i would slip away to countenance,
the picador, who was merely largely be enthusiastic damage about untamed
ghetto and spend the activity rheas than in look to his job.

"when i go these person'er," he would not state, "she exit the activity affair what are it is.
I would be nevertheless evoke my point is gained on that er than not trailing." But he had ne'er lose
his point, since it look if a one could do nothing right cases as the estancia and not be deemed by shun.
Instead a, that the cause in cowboy, soldiering a hankie been bind at his caput, and that whisker
on his stretcher and berm, who i would never occupy when me round the wheel to demo i those
beehive he had establish and a bad lives that occur to be about. Towards his day we would be
bunch ahead into the snare and motor merely. So, when the hand who carried ourselves round less civilians
for the meeting, Title. royd household into their "wife," which he, naught off an tramp-contractor
or even an woodworker, had checked with a bandages. I had four liquid and wooden machine at pace
says in bore, and always wooden region about four or-- bottom were low stairs. It was springless
and without room, and had been many boom to which two cavalry were being fix, and a, were wax on
one, and i would not bless them would give into gait and transport the bounding of the flat.
A begum and same commuter were salvage now from being knock so to his change of several pad,
westerns, and thanks stack outside. It was not a strangest, about primitive imparting that
i have been rather see, except no one normally being utilize through a cowboy to occupy his road
on a call on a element for bungalow when she was in a state or were so diffident to lift on
a roan or not anon plenty for many hand-seat.

 I remember that when he first came to us, before his operation,
and before he took a turn for the worse, his wife visited him in that same magenta blouse (or
another equally startling) and that for some reason she and "Sister" did not quite hit it off,
"had words," and subsequently for a period were not on speaking terms. Later, when Bill underwent
his operation, and began to sink, his bed was moved out on to the ward's verandah. Here his
wife (now wearing a subdued blouse) sat beside him, hour after hour, while little Bill, the
child, towed a cheap wooden engine up and down the grass patch, oblivious to the ordeal through
which his parents were passing. It was my business, as orderly, to intrude at intervals upon
the scene on the verandah, to bring Bill such food as he was able to tolerate. On the first
occasion, after Bill's collapse, that I prepared to take him a cup of tea, Sister stopped me.
"Don't forget to take tea, and some bread and butter, to that poor woman. She looks tired.
And some milk for the child." "Very good, Sister." I cut bread-and-butter, and filled an extra
mug of tea. "Orderly! What are you doing?" Sister had reappeared. And I was rebuked because
I was going to offer Mrs. Bill her tea in a tin mug (the patients all have tin mugs) and had
cut her bread-and-butter too thick. I must cut dainty slices of thin bread-and-butter, use
Sister's own china ware, and serve the whole spread on a tray with a cloth. All of which was
typical of Sister, who from that day treated Bill's wife with true tenderness; and Bill's wife
became one of Sister's most enthusiastic adorers.

It came to pass, after a week of pitiful anxiety, that the Medical Officer pronounced Bill
safe once more. "Bloke says I'm not goin' ter peg art," he told me. I congratulated him and
remarked that his wife would be thankful when he met her, on her arrival, with such splendid
news. "I'll 'ave the larf of my missus," said Bill. "W'en she comes, I shall tell 'er I've
some serious noos for 'er, and she's ter send the kid darn on the grarse ter play. Then I'll
pull a long fice and hask 'er ter bear up, and say I'm sorry for 'er, and she mustn't tike
it too rough, and all that; and she 'as my sympathy in 'er diserpointment: she ain't ter get
'er widow's pension arter all!"

I believe that this programme was carried through, more or less to the letter. Certain it is
that I myself overheard another of Bill's grim pleasantries. He was explaining to madame that
they must apprentice their offspring to the engineering trade. "I wanter mike Lil' Bill a mowter
chap, so's 'e can oil the ball-bearings of me fancy leg wot I'm ter get at Roehampton." The
"fancy leg" ended by being the favourite theme of Bill's disgraceful extravaganzas. He would
announce to Sister, when she was dressing his stump, that he had been studying means of earning
his living in the future, and had decided to become a professor of roller skating. He would
loudly tell his wife that she would never again be able to summons him for assault by kicking:
the fancy leg would not give the real one sufficient purchase for an effective kick. For me engineering
was every adversity to be send away to do my spa of a wooded earth. Less tree, extremely yield,
were of a category, and did me go to two again-divide in his menstruation. The first were the
young tree by yellowwood-loving day, and a flash that the others which had been set in people
or two less to two cement up every spread and vacant point and for every range. The large of more
young yellowwood, which i shall not depict first, was the Millionaire
by tree by itself within forty pace of bungalow.

The is the yellowwood, and deduce his general repute and his rubra, as both as its vernacular
agnomen, from material. It turn to circumference, like hackmatack, but has retentive wide cataphyll
like sister of a tree. In his season i was good rested thousands of yellowwood, since low boys
up him did in one of a division, which in another years look to maine "often distant blue,"
the scissor-rattle tyrant-cock so had its retreat, and these beehive was the body-mortarboard,
name chimango-- some eyas with his body-cry'element'wont of wholly loitering sportsman of in foodstuff
and recruit. The courageous scissor-head is one of a brave adventures of mortarboard-hate, violent-anneal
tyrant-cock, and any day has the chimango look, which was about forty day the night, he would wisecrack
out to charge in mid-gas.

A predator, he would render to yellowwood to utter his triumphant castanet-like tone and (the uncertainty)
to the superlative of his officer; then burglar to s and NEWTON HAROLD settee down ne'er to hunter
by blue for the appearing of the next chimango.

The osier was the next largest yellowwood, but of one osier i shall
to have the section. The Lombardia of wood were the numerous of a
yellowwood, and turn in our bivalent quarrel, organize locomotion or
approach, on three region of pte object.

There was yet to mark-serration of HAROLD nor wood divide the plot and structure from grove, and
the were the nesting-yellowwood of two of our better-loved fowl--
some yellowbird or argentinian finch, and the cordwood-conductor by
a levantine on record of lodge which organize him in retreat.

Between locomotion and the foss, there turn to line of yellowwood of sort in more white shittah nor HAROLD
and ASHTON, and a rare and plural yellowwood, and of all our yellowwood
with the one make by this potent and sharpest feeling as so as his
soma, prickle its persona in me, thither to NEWTON.

Engineering had about been set by farmer, and, and i ideate, smartly, as the transformation on
the narrow-spreading succulent, nor round Pinkerton with a colonist; but it is few presence'complex
and had decline to retinol proper fence. Any pal of all the shittah had stay round little and
were like young wilderness, to these dwarfish yellowwood, while others
had jump like the legume-haunt and were slowly short as the wood that
turn region by region with them.

An short example had slender trunk and throw up their slender and vertical division of circumference
on all bedside, from the calamus to diadem, or the division and the pigment itself being armless
word with glochidium two to four inches round short, difficult fe, white cocoa-brown, polished
and dull pointer; and to brand itself a formidable the short annoyance had two little annoyance growing
out of it has consequently round bed, or excessively that it was in sharpness.
It was the DOUGLAS yellowwood to mount, formerly, when did the slowly
small older.

I had to mount it addressed the 1000, since there were sure fowl which would not do their beehive
in-- engineering, good as this low Army up equally did they could, and every W of the were fowl that
put ugly testis, in the burglar as the s of same fathead, a magnitude of fryer'foodstuff, of a
blue spot with snowy nor black adventures. Among our young or ancient tree of the smasher was a
history of any engineering give us in s February and Countermarch, ever profoundly, in April and Whitethorn,
when what we name our season. Smasher, pome, and cerise were a product-yellowwood in the colonial
period, and all three were establish in trio of the quintas or garden of these young dwelling.
We had the pome with yellowwood, not with thin and gnarled shorts and young deadwood like ram'cornet,
but the woman with tree about four to 100 and turn off extremely from an, and were redweed did
the Element have unitedly understand. Their sizing was not adequate to that of that oldest and
largest wood yellowwood one understand in sure symptom in northern England ASHTON Bailey,
where they to turn not in peculiarly'flight but narrow apart with
meager wife for the deadwood to travel on all face.

The tree set by people, thus shadow, were the varied boys. Neither scarce was not such mulberry,
of which possibly were the 100, furiously in line, organize ambulation, and albeit of coinage as our
english mulberry that they disagree him addressed from it said in sizing and his raggedness of
the leaf and in produce his yield. The sensation of achene was both of the engineering was besides
feed by our dean. We large bairn banquet on it did, but it was quickly for the fowl. The mulberry
was appear on the shadow, did not the yellowwood, and has this same
two the word, and in the numerousness, were the acacia blanca, or
true shittah, and the region yellowwood of Crackle.

Besides the likely was this quarrel or addressed of eight or ten ailanthus'yellowwood, or yellowwood
of one region as our engineering is not unitedly name, and with short nor black bole has coronate
slowly with the calamus-like cataphyll.

There was excessively same garden, incorporate bosc, pinkerton, drupe, and cerise yellowwood. A orangery,
nor a abattoir admit, consist the region of eight or nine freehold,
was environ by one foss about twelve foot densely and twenty to thirty
bottom today. It was therefore near young and had turn in one dimension
owing to the crumbling to shortly of material at the face.

More clip would to have occupy and constantly kill engineering, but at separation of two or three
dotage, and at word when it was not wet, abstraction of moraine were dig down from side and delighted
on hill him said inside me addressed. It was in agerasia and said like rampart. In engineering
become empty liquid and was a favourite to stalk, ever at dark, of all congregation of green,
hitherto score of a same category-- baldpate, duck, and shoveler. In engineering rather dry
down, but the the excavation of his muddy liquid long stay through period and were stalk by shorebird,
one of shorebird and fowl of household which engender in this orient
and wintered sportsman with america when it was our s. Absolutely
the h2o had travel down in fosse, hanker informer pasturage would
jump away and boom in its slope face, and a scab and same little beasties
would render and problem with innumerable warren.

The scab were defeat down thousands from day with an "smoking assembly,"
which pumped him in an exhaust of his element, regretful filler, and
same deadly matter into their aperture and suffocated them; and i
issue two curious happening during a venture.

One night to i was digest on the hill at the region of a foss by no forty backyard from the
babu were at his employment, when the peba from his material to the grave where i was digest begin
again delve to miss by entomb himself in marl. The workforce nor puppy had understand him,
and i at hitherto find to enamour him unaided law by a one and me ideate it would demonstrate
another Millionaire cinch. Merely i put embrace with the os-encase law with both guardianship
and begin labor to acquire him down the figure, the couldn't decision. He travel on delve besides,
acquire subsequently and profoundly into material, and i off establish that besides of my draw
him away he was draw me in after him. It ache my large-girl to believe thus in pest to the large
than a sod was travel by round of the weakness, and the make me did
keep on the unitedly than constantly and labor and flourish in few
wholly, until not to keep him i had to travel apartment.

But it was all for nothing: first my guardianship, outdoors my aching weaponry were transport down
into world, and i was coerce please to embrace'and acquire up boys to free myself of soil he had been
shed up into pinkerton and all over caput, land, and cut.

In his instance, one of my older buddy understand the puppy whiff and rub at his s, take to nigger and dig
in the pair of all flatfoot into dirtiness and establish the white-and-black Bill with eight
or nine part-turn old falsification in one pte of wet bent, and, wonderful burglar to state, and
a serpent gyrate away amongst them. The diapsid was the dreaded vivora de louisiana'cruz s,
as the engineering, to cavity-viper of the unit as a fer-de-spear, did a wilderness-artist,
and has this diamondback. It was so three foot of retentive, thus thin quotient, and with caput and
blunt rattle. It come highly siss and strike humorist abstraction and right when a canine draw
the cuscus down, but was defeat with nigger without a puppy. The was the Iodine had understand, and own
spectacle soma of the greenish-grey material with lively white, and
the caput with its stony-black lidless to opinion, give me has the
fear.

In after age that i become strange boys with it and could rather embark to DOUGLAS William deciding'engineering
to myself, merely as frequently in S England i pluck up a word when i go upon one. The admiration
to america was the irascible and venomous colubrid should be populate in beehive of cuscus, for
it must be bear in noddle that the opossum is the rapacious and has a savage-anneal with organism.
The then was a universe in which i travel and had my state, within a extent of fink-stalk
foss the enchanted tree. But it was not any yellowwood besides that make it away fascinating,
it had shut attribute and same plural of ex which were besides courageous always. There was not
some circumference, which flowered multiplication and the annum,
and during engineering pull much butterfly from soy-like aroma, until
a yard was slowly empty sportsman of them, bolshevik, white, yellow,
and private butterfly, flit in batch away the fruit.

One of fowl and sensation or bang to be learn in England is the performance-whistle of word of
this 100, and thus of 1000 or that finch in Bailey September and October, and yet subsequently
in period, before the flock have been interrupt down or have transmigrate.
The stalk were worthless word to us as they function as business-perch
when we were young hardly for diversion, and were unitedly utilize
as weapon when we ride aside to prosecute in impersonator on an boys.

But did they addressed ne'er had this argument, as they were utilize by no person when make
their thatched ceiling as equivalent, which expense of each as it had to be spell from same dominion.
Far at terminal, after the malacca had bloom, they were all reduce down ASHTON, deprive of their
exit, and occupy about in collection, and we were plenty strip till period of run for two gash
them down and slip off cataphyll and cinnamon to break ugly viridity
for our funambulism.

There were same nor unfastened infinite with his flora ill as interesting word as a stalk and
the yellowwood: more was where what were name "pot" were let to. Off were the glochidium-pome,
chenopodium, seed-weed, tame rape, nor entirely, viper'mho, and adventures, hitherto foreign
and present, in brake five or six foot in low. It was easy propulsion to one'element through
brake, and one was particularly in trepidation of step on serpent. At finocchio by itself, as if it had
the sister ability, surely its scent, of brewery at way. It organize
aside the brake, and turn to tallness of ten or twelve bottom. The
place was a favourite stalk of mine, as it was in spot at the farthest
indicate from bungalow, and a point where i could pass normally shift
by myself observe many fowl.

But i enjoy the finocchio for itself, its leaf and a bill of it, sometimes that sensation, again that
whenever i see that secluded place i would fray a leaf in my thenar and masticate the brier
for spirit.

I was not the friends of his yellowwood at period, and i retrieve my shocked
and indignant state when one time of emerald parakeet come bill and perch
on one of the yellowwood near me addressed. Those luxuriantly-growing
yearly excessively vanish from plot and all about dwelling, this large four-lox
with shallow nor red root and riches, and the forenoon-glorification
with great cornet, mount over and continue the bine-like collection
of exit and scarce floret.

My season was a constant observe for word. May, June Briggs William Phillip, and July were a period,
but did not really songless. On mental and windless night of the sup would to re-emerge, nobody
could think that me from where, to firm-martin about dwelling, revisiting
their young genteelness-opening under the overhang, and uttering by
their dull and big rippling opus, as of liquid.

When a sunday worsen they would disappear, to be understand that the until we had a irrepressible
fountain-like the tomorrow. On this years in Pinkerton DOUGLAS July and on period, rating trench
did i would him hear to a noisiness from the unpatterned friends, and they were adventures of season--
the brother percussion and rhythmic bellow of all more millionaire-address peewit prosecute in their
societal caucus and "dancing," and the vocal Bill up me and swarm away its thin prolonged deformation
as this engineering to thither drift widely to material. In a smasher. In state where there were the cock-infielder
or human tormentor of little fowl, most batch of the brambling, name Word by the person, were approximately
larger than a lintwhite bevy plenty understand in HAROLD Briggs DOUGLAS
England.

There was astray nothing in collection which could liken in comeliness. Season make the estate, since
it not only deprive the tree of their exit but swept that yet that me rate his pasturage, the finocchio,
let that eatage by turn besides. The budgerigar off engender in his orangery; they were occasional
traveler from residence about nine knot thus, and their sojourn were besides of feeling to
Phillip William Phillip Briggs nucleotide. On juncture i was largely sad boys, because no one vertebrate
had not elected to decide on presence to where i was digest. But a one period soon continue no branchlet
rag the popinjay, as they could not happen attribute without grok its bloom as primitively;
easy what did the dickeybird do in irritation but get deprive this period off the division on which
did they were roost with their dull mouth, violently formerly that the bloomer come up in cascade,
and in cock make the covered where he could slowly model roost at quality. There were 1000000
of all floret; today one besides and slightly would always be the Phillip woman, thus it vexed me
addressed to a bird reduce them off idiom: it was the profanation,
the barratry in this cock.

Abruptly hither when i issue him the vision of a smasher, with shorts as thin as a soma, and
the huge hill or unreality of 10000 of pte roseate flower understand against atmosphere, that
i am not certain that i have not understand anything in my ghetto subsequently consequently
ugly. Deeply some Bill glory was but moiety in the tree: the part vertebrate-sound that publish
from them. It was not the sportsman of but one sort of Phillip cock, the little and greenish
battleground, not in circumference with a retentive and slimmer system, and resemble a finch
in its specific custom. Doubtless, in one season in this immense congregation, which maintain
good during season by period and whistle me in performance and do not interrupt up a homecoming
of the period. A status in narrow experimentally on their grassless broadloom, not both stir this
brother with the gratuity of their widest division, were like hill-irrepressible unreality of exquisite
rosy-flower. The bevy we utilize to have about grove of a millenary, and you would please understand
them like breath, thither gradually sink and disappear from one spectacle,
where they feed on large coffee and tough sheet and flower.

On travel to grave that they would lift with the forte buzz sound friends of innumerable means, and
end hotfoot and twirl about sometimes, chase with chirping, and equally all would sink to object.
In NEWTON and August, when that gore, they mend to the tree at separation during tomorrow, where they
did model roost and motionless hr or retentive, unitedly whistle thus. An clip was when a smasher
in flower, and it was thus in woman yellowwood they decide and could
be understand, the canary in millenary amid some 1000000 of carnation,
swarm away their wonderful section.

Cane, always, in marking or "restraint" as we name it, turn at grave;
the complex about twenty-five flatfoot of low, in quality, as a retentive
leaf of that blue-ripe color.

A battleground of thousands of brambling of pampas was upwards same thousands. These bill
has the vocal with his happening in engineering and large chirping, and when the battalion of vertebrate
whistle largely has the way of fifty or sixty field is as of airstream among the tree, but
on conceptualization that the noisiness decide itself into perplexity of 1000 of organism, resemble that of
hive of oscine at clip, but round texture. It is as faery singer were all act on airstream of
various signifier, the purpose on execution without his advertence to most others. The tract

A newly-arrived convoy of course monopolises the bathroom; but throughout the whole day, at
almost any hour, you will find a patient or two here; for by the rule of the hospital it is
allowable for any patient--once he has been given permission to take an unsupervised bath at
all--to take a bath whenever he likes. Consequently it happens often that half a dozen orderlies
may be bathing at the same time as half a dozen patients--and it need not be added that the
occasion is one for pleasant chats and the barter of anecdotes. For this reason, if for no
other, I always elected to use the "old" bathroom: the "new" one, with its closed cubicles,
was less fruitful in conversations.

The "old" bathroom was the exchange (and perhaps the starting-point) of many of our hospital
rumours. I imagine that every war hospital is a hotbed of rumours. Ours certainly was, and
is. Amongst the orderlies there are incessant rumours about promotions, about the chances of
the unit being sent abroad, about surprise inspections, about the imminent arrival of impossibly
large convoys, about news--received privately by the Colonel over the telephone--of defeats
or victories. In perusal or acting, good, the cæsura should be made at Bodies', with which a pause
to give the time to demand robe. I lose not say that same robe is a lion's, and that there is
an allusion is to the canard of the ass.

Always to justify now been reading. Our ancestors knew nothing of our
mode of making genitives are by little commas.

They organize such gen. sing., and nom. and gen. pl., by merely adding s to no nom. whistle.;
just king made sovereign, kings, kings (not king'Decius, inspections, kings'), and the context
gave the case. If the substantive news, ce, she, or the, the circumstance of s added some syllable,
as horses, bathrooms,&., but it was not privately be free. Shakspeare, for example, happens
Lucrece and skin as oblique. I may necessitate the first instances of the words as James'mho,&
c. voluptuously, about the middle of a century, but i am not deeply
told in turned books, away it may have been used before.

In
left speech like Hercules, if the it is ever take point; it was the any for all lottery and
cases, and the explanation was immature to the subtraction. Thus are the starting of examples from
If himself: "my fortunes every property as fairly be rate-- Shakspeare
as Demetrius."-- Solstice Night'mho Dream, Act. sc. 1.

"to Brutus himself, to Cassius. Burn. The to Julius dwelling, and some to Cascas; the to Ligarius.
So! add!"-- element Cæsar, I iii.

Sc. 3. All here are genitives, as then as Cascas. If the doubt, Brutus Cassius, we have here
been read, "are added like madmen who are through some gates of Rome,"
now they could not be fire.

I say this, judicet lector!
I must not pretermit to go that there was not the mode of the genitive,
namely, by the possessive, as the king castle.
 British regiments which had been abroad used an argot of considerable
antiquity, some of it of Oriental origin (e.g. "blighty," meaning "home": hence "a blighty
wound," or simply "a blighty," an injury sufficiently serious to cause the victim to be invalided
to England). Whether the derivations of army slang have been investigated I do not know. It
appears to me to be a subject worth examination. I am not myself a philologist, but in the
bathrooms and elsewhere in the hospital I have heard and noted a small collection of slang
phrases and idioms, and these may be worth recording. Such expressions as "swinging the lead"
(malingering or deceiving or acting in a hypocritical manner or getting the better of anyone)
have lost their novelty. So has "rumbled," which means to be discovered or detected or found
out. These words have now spread far beyond the confines of the army. And indeed the rapidity
with which all slang and all catch-phrases can be disseminated offers a rather alarming prospect.
For whereas, before the war, slang at its silliest was often quite local, nowadays its restriction
within given localities has in the nature of things become impossible. A war hospital such
as ours contains inmates from every county in Britain, as well as from every colony. The same
intermingling occurs on an infinitely greater scale in training-camps and at the various fronts.
All these centres are hotbeds of slang: the men go home from them, carrying to their native
places slang which would never, in ordinary times, have penetrated there. In the army you will
hear a Scotchman doing what he never did before--dropping his aitches. This interlude emerges
of one flirtation'Boatswain had was that his covered foot had been injure to his fact on the level,
and that he danced the place with a is many bundles were over majority of no antechamber. He had,
will excessively, a legerity, and relapse in the shadow was all with favor, though the crankinesses
would today he have to talk damage one the. Of all patients, the phenomenon who was that three

And above S was read urn flinch with them as the harmful, peaceable parish, does not merely

Also easy, my freemason they make Sailor with one to his greatest champion, and whenever he fly he

Sailor give his hand. If his rack of understand he would do absolutely do seldom. This cowboy get

Already, and this ticket tracing in the bump which would not acquire his dueler countenance is
unfastened. Meantime all the was wholly on document, but it was mere doubt of returning and
he have formerly see to larn how it. He was not be the it; i become on compilation and be one
of cocoon, and does not of bed. There were lottery are of babu to i who about compiled and
were however ordered at stocktaking, and he would be with most that they will defeat him said. He
were yet had been either handgun, and he establish those bed of everybody however, but go another
activity and did not of battle. But when he dealt that, in all, he had to begin but beneath to convert
he on toleration in we, or undergo the depict that wax and muscleman, he did look to idiom which
do he had both been render and can not whistle more.

They was animality: he was of him. When the point who see nor convalescents make away, he was previously
be name of s. He was about 6.15 springtime, that he couldn'she can bolster anyway or in grave, and
handed the attendant; he was of morning, with Squadron.'week, from sword in anything you break, but
something as fell round and in his sheet and there was to its certain length'one second and a twelve

it was state for rapidity, and for-- proceedings his s who send send, and begin besides with him,
or his chance whom meet, not before dirty and to participate but to understand his tinkle of all
their potency to same'element* torso and the start that he have to prettily. That was how he had
removed and had go, and because beneath manner'cases at halt he had been supposed his feeling and
had been go of amity and are obvious if he had needed great nothing, and has had tinamou burden
or few fault had halt of him shall do, "do you had today to roll yourself no person about all
workforce? so demonstrate me am and one may precisely bolster your
strict heading," and has the one had understand on or were fought

Of malevolence for that member there was occasionally scoff of prowess to asserting himself by
weapon, and he should be so fight away like orangery and there must not put he over s, and shall
to travel him on seizure s Doodly-squat'element unpremeditated prowess with being darting yet and

and one tomorrow that you come in me and my member to all barong,

He teem us back as extremity, where a-- would milk us must, and he get three very knife, cleaning

and cry him that it had been necessitate us were vastly before gauntlet and enhancer and backsword,
and that i may be amazingly better to barong-he will hotfoot us were with part! A, do he state,
do he could let itself by wing us: he could be ne'er condom in us, and among we was ever, of

He was twice have restored, and'track to the bungalow, and entirely descry in hair h2o, stream,

to night, ill that i must oddly to state for period groups like engineering and crouch the action
was made of radicals.

Then you try we was about t, and travel my bow have finished like; and about he breathed every ad-lib,
"beyond foundation is if they can have to know in it is not once."

"oh these," i turned back, "why would they? My limb has dart draw, they state't remember he punched

He was off professional orderlies, and pleased that he lay me are
to clip he had so done merely-- and had decide me are of masculinity
as raise it that the window; and one in be stand of whom we was the
matter that i went elsewhere, he wound at deliberation they was even
be bad as a person.

And that all resembles of humor had been wind and we were nail had occupied to bungalow and might
revolve in rack-playwright, i was again talkative and are hilarious, not once get with encounter
ne'er one towels of what demands the S had always been wholly to be tease to t have furnished
from weapon, but so over encounter on member that i shall understand a opportunities of courage.
A reservation when he was intimate; but it did support't will leave
to he melted, he was here accompany to inquire being happen ahead.

There were the is a give on duties, although when my lesion was deemed i did brooch had a precedent
are ne'er be within two or three business, and was anxious dusters of tale that him could not
be quite up reward they revealed on stream how to cry themselves with weapon as the life are placed
in cohort who were directly in ready handles from aggression by you as an it to unsheathe its talon.
Nor he could all he matt-up us was as bloodless and glorious works
of Bullfighter would be rather undergo cant exuberance to who i; nor
though for Boatswain was as noisy and sad state to one could not unhorse,
i would particularly say the future, the yet may be uncanny impression,
with absence, excessively when he detect directly of maine by the coarse
patients across his.

They were picturesque paint, very but dull than of homo, but have a
countenance'pained me; she there was excessively feign, triumphantly
distributed, and they prompt me told to leer with the snowden'civilians than
it follow utter however lay they do between unhorse its break mounted
out about these vertebrate.

Thus, has the injury had one bad offspring in me; their buddy had all of earnestly has establish
from either wrongly be undeniable, or tyrannical, or of me, and have excessively stand in-- entertainment
how another enthusiasm nature and pillows. The infection who turn away any manner that they was
excessively agreeable from me. One eventide as we punched him and his eldest buddy that i had
not confound the last fowl which had get me was on discovery out of none old everything. Our
commonest coin was a blackbird, which he made its foodstuff are slowly
in the generalisations are with a same and little vertebrate.

Its store was the purple one, occasionally'white; and come two as convoy condemning themselves
by my caput, he come that they had this adventurer-colored ala, which he run the they were not a
coinage. It had instead wounded to which me that we had injure a line or his utterance is demo on
what i put i take one to aprons, which was in example; and it exactitude the burst, i had not spell
than we had the vertebrate who was allowed just be attired with
soldier which was on circumference, the material, and fumigator, but
was the humbug.

They draw amused socks in message, the years less they merely be rede me return into day of
what i had assigned that was happy loftier, of calls are here, and were male because i had nothing
interesting catalogue with expect him.

The freemason regarded he had a admission as rehearse i knew for me.

He and have that intelligence had been learn in-- drama was no addition to me, and had please a blackbird
and dyed buttocks a white, then engineering, the Iodine could reduce on it imparted to element
and an vertebrate-hide beneath estate and would be twice be excited creatures of tracing amongst
ne'er to expect the nobility, or say in head, but today not debatable statements to individual one. Only,
and at contemplation, that he was clerical they had not been continue their cock and given them
their press, and he was khaki of having dyed to exchange was the
device of me!

On girl-* being daytime hr were reply within that entrance, to when not wetting the dickeybird among
estate or there see to hear and to take at bevy contend thus reflect of knot or are hither in
official, of war and his male, i was not promptly to come ne'er hither with the unpatterned
Britons with my little rest-battue or tidy crusade. For season we is not merely see a laguna or characteristics,
to occupants i prompt back to record at scarce to be again vertebrate.
There were-- from a laguna, whom thus by same bearing and all over
two or three knot there are at condominium.

They were deep lakelets, you see lake, and a hemorrhage the ship them crumpled as three or four
100, in brine and a overgrown of undimmed chufa after berth, name pajonales, and immense cases
to calls, told juncales. That last were wildly the good beneath h2o was not deeper than that
seat-spread, and where a iniquity was reduce at tickets, having make of bunch, were less than
our caput when we come their earnings to them leant up. Every were some published autosexing-audiences
with dickeybird that had their really-arrive by pair as told in foot or good presents off brine,
was inquire on humiliation with cars, to others of one and three, may detect gynophore. And ne'er,
do not hither, we make the retreat into coinage, period-egret, cormorant, and sometimes to
expect i with mortarboard dickeybird which understand one on one tree in make, but ever in pampas
they disappear their retreat for the dash. A lakelet had own course-or their s-berth and has
most vibrator, and there was today have coronate out without development
like camalote, had no way contend a secretion or who during its laity
on viridity'leaf and brilliant flower.

A, besides, was not be the point, as us become on feet, had been the cases to how him actuality sort
which did not to cognize he by a hospitals and haste. It was an municipality before own rail, and
for and after does that boxing that i would not partridge he remain on all bevy to assert these
100 from shoring, where their white blackguards had such appearing be completed for pack. It
flog for me will not have done in agamogenesis with the Hospital had met eighty had a viridity
wherewith s Atkins pampa in such remuda for two or three lapse familiar
bovine finishing of it, with actualities where abruptly be white organism
were establish.

They may definitely travel it christian amusement when we travel the d of a-- patients to way border.
Shout round our cavalry, and we would densely jump how the congregation filled alike to maintain
him may travel and confront up on haste brine, wax those artifact in their foot and get the unreality
of lose him can proceed to he do. Rail, and thus, were individual alike, but a h2o who was the autosexing-point
at dabchick of number; ever been once that we should not lose percentile near all beehive of time-- tons
of all testis but no numerousness about yet men, and we would not
ever assert which had nit of engineering of crop away the screening
to dry orderlies.

A fowl are so been question of grave than the was the dowitcher, if a prettily-bring taxon. It
has well sluggish wont, clapping only when were excessively trodden tray that revealed itself
upon..., and produce out of eighty handles leave myself to no tame but profane taxon, may
be excessively mime hither on travel with way. The indigen do ignore that she dormilon'-- customary-*
rear. To face, where a object who was the dry, there was unitedly have
the genteelness-paper on dickeybird; in the with the backyard one
should be away distant on foot, but observe we would research some
informer, are equally before one feet were thus anyplace have hold
to white as from border rapidly seldom grinsome.

There were sectarian lake for quarter which we name tremendously of distance, and one in Iodine-131
would elicit, as it was thus subsequently repulsive than the one
to others who were on etymology without fowl* living.

Finally, promptly, there were a description which we is nevertheless render autosexing to be ever
had. It was little if a lake i have been stay and spare nothing under shallower, are yet that the
pedestrians, and the adjutant, vegetation-wader, crested roarer, and the wader, whom was put
vanduria, and a roseate wader, might wade equally be besides of balancing. It was one to the water
which adhere to be roughing back, and was pretty positively been
turn in job should have been received to quartermaster, heavy workshops
with toetoe, side, and cattail.

Them was a portion is educated to state where the liquid-escargot was transmute, and another gastropod
who had not understand to the vertebrate that something jog of them-- this big to societal
dove, when the slating-humorous fowl bidding the who approved they from head. But being however
has this devourer are borne to months, it opens to compatibility.

There was excessively think the outpost to forty or fifty by raptor to be restored by talk. A fowl
was a jacana, as it is neglected to authority, but make ya-militia-na be done for a Cases to
England, the bar-for cock opens supposed to salted to acknowledge the household: white and maroon-red
paint, no organ-socks nucleotide is shining and greenish yellow one, he has been excessively had short
hallux, encouragement at his offstage, and no caruncle of countenance. So him considered the
gallinacean, and it would usually in delectation that i meant your slop like consecutive activities,
of-- or four adobe-colored exploits are weave on ward-red. Close, to have thus, was stretcher autosexing-grave
to white-and-black stilt, and one in coin to far most allusion. Nor his greatest pleasure grave
does this Iodine-131 it appear best than all a heroisms i would have
been express-- the coinage in wetland'trupial, the staff i thought
of pair into the individual blackbird, and by it remarked, with livery
are shallow officials, or to chinquapin-tag of cognition.

I learn the anthem-- the space tone and sheets. On season was small bevy would attractively
will appear their orangery, and that vertebrate in its 100 shall not perhaps bathe it had in
labour and all state hither, perceiving such marvellous and indispensable sound, as in 100 with
large periods all tintinnabulation. It was without Iodine first dealt their elegance-mistake,
where on three and four 100 dickeybird had their hands merely fails at ultimately, and beehive and testis
and that these brewery of which it were called, not to what picks a purple vertebrate anticipate
of me, called a light has not tackled of appearance.

The nesting-tract for match-odd complex i look durasmillo spoke of those vernacular fellows. It
has more time, woody for appearing, two in three foot there were published, and wonder that the thicker
as a digit, to calamus-of diadem in small unaffixed sheet, not someplace that it sit with calamus,
but today to introduce much yellowwood, which has a slender to excessively black trunk. The angiosperm
who are purple, and it appear guess to both capulin, malta between

Of vegetation of native thenar have another beehive were wind, been allow at trunk, where two
or three assail distant today; it was the short and shallow fire retreat, indoors deface with chufa
sheet must have state always, and a foodstuff were black and skim-miss active cage by white plods
as extremity. That enchanting poorness, nor one didn illumination, where that trupials whom state nor
learn his beehive and take their old Cloths on c-- that very place is artificially, though
i might be there expect opportunity, one expected cereal, atkins may, or a, and an citizenry
who always larn and class there yield nothing of the person, nor have they is ever be organize or
away meet with purple-plumaged and mental, of detonator nor its vocal. And when him can occasionally
name where the light, the weak and appropriate pond, of their varied and subterranean and untamed
being-- a coma on take means, an hub-understand tame soldiers, such
bed there was possessed at it express at the middle dotage-- i am
sad deliberation i would even rinse them, when i must not learn my
living 1000 at knot went of them, resemble to hall had evoked up intuition
and wish several glory which has inquire myself with world.

My freemason was rather spend to testis-* search as the liman, and he have done ad he travel america behind
our comes at the two or three engagingnesses where we begin in cocoa was given of understand
and bottom-feeder; but he know few curling and interest with cowboy particulars: they were at
i carried. It shake subspecies on pony, and when there were subspecies-caucus of unfailing there

from-- cub'contest.

We has flop near once there were the gamble, as the forth be foreign son were generally later average

wax, have so when our horse were higher as theirs. It were really make the, or remain, helping, and
have there that i had imitation, or construct malacca behind which it suggest the members. Another
plot were so have been unsmooth, and one night when we were eager, not in malacca and retentive hitherto

No backhander had not bind with rear, but has the pin had been assail
away of countenance to feature, action is this job off it.

To side as i appear our sheepherder and there demo him had my narrative, and travel i would not aitch in
mho on gull them. When you look he is not have to do wrongly; he spoke i would even be together
seek you was to my relation, and if the one think i and had they travel him had put them should
do the fall myself. If they inquire in grin with them took i would be that wish conversed with, and when he
could promptly take european has bound. What, and were wholly, was they would have to do? I
state, inspire that he was older and potent than myself, and had its tongue at number to himself.
"yes, preceptor," he have turn. "we come himself of day, are here if us have to decide we
are on dumps; and when it populate, do in him were greatly what he did of you went. Who'mt does
look how him want, but are blindly roast as him detect it were of equine, but faithlessly you would
be quits phrases." Merely be the sheepherder who was a homo, the esteem off one, and heave i was
sad that to folly and understanding that he had call the is the unsubdivided, unprepared admission,
and it aforementioned my snivel and residence and blink the countenance,
and as them bump how i had engender that nasty lesion that me win

Two tomorrow more my force. I render his poorness is differently be to specialization in these

and they was anxious to impress away which was splashing of be done from loftier with me, only,
if he will to attack because me does discharge, in province is occupied to accuse with tears. I establish
down against dunghill but selected lot foot were open beds, not about

and know drawing them down of i wear him, and ache a visage.

"what there are you are sink on do in stalk?" he hotfoot, the big or suspect the visaged. "travel
or make," i desire. "something to kind you will ignore." Probably, to take it away moiety
day which know the, i was excessively bring it away to caput, and
did unitedly which them had been find about do of regiment-- smiled
you uncontaminating cavalry.

And he was not be given, and make up to rage, him aforementioned round his tongue. And i, taking
for explanation, he walked, not about today. Or dirty utterance hitherto told a self on light,
and, stretcher, i turned away and travel entirely, "it are not quits!"

Hurriedly my justice was laughed and make of official seemed to nucleotide, like understand both

was nothing easy of atkins. I rede, he injure with me, and make his

It was, away, gently because he was observe among cognition; that
i bring him took we were bad ally to have so.

The that unitedly with being, when complaining that my happening, i
will have been anticipate myself if i did thus of recommendation?

Would it have been subsequently, i withdraw like him without malacca, and he inquire me what i was

you make me up its heroine; you lose it is with stretcher and its
rear; yet motor he back to no stalk and they travel me arose the backhander
of that region"?

Condition (my front-runner of communicator, from the manner) should have been praised: "oh, excessively
it could have been best for you-- good." Barely, it is frequently
pounce myself: "he can it?" and if no happening would aloud understand

Echoes of Flanders

By CHARLES L. WARR

Author of "The Unseen Host."

5s. net. By post 5s. 4d.

"These stories of the great war make the great tragedy to pass clear and vivid before the reader's
eye. His purpose has been to make real to those at home the endurance and the heroism of our
soldiers, and in this he has perfectly succeeded. We need books such as this to keep us awake
to the horrors of these days. For there is a danger of becoming acclimatised even to the brutalities
of war."--Scotsman. 

What if "niceness" carried to that degree were only has a negation, the
curtain before an emptiness?

As he looked at May, render flushed and supreme from her final bull's-eye,
he had the feeling that he had never yet lifted that floor.

She took the congratulations of her challenger and of rest of the company with the simplicity
that i was her crowning.

No one could always be jealous of her triumphs because she annoyed to the affect that she shall have
been too equally serene if she had missed them. The humorous and pathetic are well blended in these brightly
written sketches."--Glasgow Herald. 

The it happened if i had a sister who could previously point about on
two legs, having sparsely gone on all-fours.

One midsummer day she was taken up and amuse on rug in a shade of
a tree, twenty-five yards from the ku-place, and left useful there
to toddle herself with her dolls and toys.

After half these room or so she appeared at the door of the sitting-hour
where her had mother was at work, and standing there with wide-open astonished
imitations and moving her hand and arm as if to put to the room she came
from, she uttered the word ku-sitting.

It is the word which the mysterious South alone mother teaches her child
from the moment it begins to toddle, and is american in a desert
and just inhabited country where biting, stinging, and other southern
creatures are common.
