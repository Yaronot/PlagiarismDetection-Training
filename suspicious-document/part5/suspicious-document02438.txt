(1564).  Granvella had been overthrown, but his party still remained. His policy lived in his
creatures, whom he left behind him in the privy council and in the chamber of finance.  Hatred
still smouldered amongst the factious long after the leader was banished, and the names of
the Orange and Royalist parties, of the Patriots and Cardinalists still continued to divide
the senate and to keep up the flames of discord. "do you play, again?"

"i fiddle every little. I try to learn something tired before them the
time. A last time i learned to do conjuring tricks. They'd get new of
me if i didn't bring something different. I'm thinking for learning
the penny whistle of I go then."  This
highly meritorious old man, whom we have to thank for some valuable contributions towards the
history of the rebellion of the Low Countries, and whose confidential correspondence with his
friends has generally been the guide of our narrative, was one of the greatest lawyers of his
time, as well as a theologian and priest, and had already, under the Emperor, filled the most
important offices. Familiar intercourse with the learned men who adorned the age, and at the
head of whom stood Erasmus of Rotterdam, combined with frequent travels in the imperial service,
had extended the sphere of his information and experience, and in many points raised him in
his principles and opinions above his contemporaries.  The fame of his erudition filled the
whole century in which he lived, and has handed his name down to posterity.  When, in the year
1548, the connection of the Netherlands with the German empire was to be settled at the Diet
of Augsburg, Charles V. sent hither this statesman to manage the interests of the provinces;
and his ability principally succeeded in turning the negotiations to the advantage of the Netherlands.
After the death of the Emperor, Viglius was one of the many eminent ministers bequeathed to
Philip by his father, and one of the few in whom be honored his memory. The fortune of the
minister, Granvella, with whom he was united by the ties of an early acquaintance, raised him
likewise to greatness; but he did not share the fall of his patron, because he had not participated
in his lust of power; nor, consequently, the hatred which attached to him. "Yes, I cognize." She meet
his glance. "But after all-- yet here we're alone unitedly, aren't
we?" "Oh, dearest one always!"

Archer cried.

Evidently she was always going
to realize; she was always travel in his roman king and situation.

Viglius was a man of learning, but no thinker; an experienced statesman, but without an enlightened
mind; of an intellect not sufficiently powerful to break, like his friend Erasmus, the fetters
of error, yet not sufficiently bad to employ it, like his predecessor, Granvella, in the service
of his own passions.  Too weak and timid to follow boldly the guidance of his reason, he preferred
trusting to the more convenient path of conscience; a thing was just so soon as it became his
duty; he belonged to those honest men who are indispensable to bad ones; fraud reckoned on
his honesty.  Half a century later he would have received his immortality from the freedom
which he now helped to subvert. In the privy council at Brussels he was the servant of tyranny;
in the parliament in London, or in the senate at Amsterdam, he would have died, perhaps, like
Thomas More or Olden Barneveldt.

In the Count Barlaimont, the president of the council of finance, the opposition had a no less
formidable antagonist than in Viglius. Historians have transmitted but little information regarding
the services and the opinions of this man.  In the first part of his career the dazzling greatness
of Cardinal Granvella seems to have cast a shade over him; after the latter had disappeared
from the stage the superiority of the opposite party kept him down, but still the little that
we do find respecting him throws a favorable light over his character.  More than once the
Prince of Orange exerted himself to detach him from the interests of the cardinal, and to join
him to his own party--sufficient proof that he placed a value on the prize.  All his efforts
failed, which shows that he had to do with no vacillating character.  More than once we see
him alone, of all the members of the council, stepping forward to oppose the dominant faction,
and protecting against universal opposition the interests of the crown, which were in momentary
peril of being sacrificed.  When the Prince of Orange had assembled the knights of the Golden
Fleece in his own palace, with a view to induce them to come to a preparatory resolution for
the abolition of the Inquisition, Barlaimont was the first to denounce the illegality of this
proceeding and to inform the regent of it.  Some time after the prince asked him if the regent
knew of that assembly, and Barlaitnont hesitated not a moment to avow to him the truth. He told
me the story (of our van looked in Connaught) which had inspired the ballad. "Yes," he said;
"But President whom can't we take your advice, because has well it would not be quite his own." I told
him that I felt the stanza near the beginning.

Amongst the adherents of the royal party at Brussels, we have, further, the names of the Duke
of Arschot, the Counts of Mansfeld, Megen, and Aremberg--all three native Netherlanders; and
therefore, as it appeared, bound equally with the whole Netherlandish nobility to oppose the
hierarchy and the royal power in their native country.  So much the more surprised must we
feel at their contrary behavior, and which is indeed the more remarkable, since we find them
on terms of friendship with the most eminent members of the faction, and anything but insensible
to the common grievances of their country.

But they had not self-confidence or heroism enough to venture on an unequal contest with so
superior an antagonist.  With a cowardly prudence they made their just discontent submit to
the stern law of necessity, and imposed a hard sacrifice on their pride because their pampered
vanity was capable of nothing better.  Too thrifty and too discreet to wish to extort from
the justice or the fear of their sovereign the certain good which they already possessed from
his voluntary generosity, or to resign a real happiness in order to preserve the shadow of
another, they rather employed the propitious moment to drive a traffic with their constancy,
which, from the general defection of the nobility, had now risen in value.  Caring little for
true glory, they allowed their ambition to decide which party they should take; for the ambition
of base minds prefers to bow beneath the hard yoke of compulsion rather than submit to the
gentle sway of a superior intellect.  Small would have been the value of the favor conferred
had they bestowed themselves on the Prince of Orange; but their connection with royalty made
them so much the more formidable as opponents.  There their names would have been lost among
his numerous adherents and in the splendor of their rival.  On the almost deserted side of
the court their insignificant merit acquired lustre.
