"When the great tenement flat ran up on the north, where I could, not so long ago, see the
masts of the shipping in the Hudson, I sighed, and prayed that the tins and bottles that I
gathered up each morning might not single me out when I was tying up my vines in the moonlight
of early summer nights.

"Josephus resented these missiles, however, and his foolish habit of sitting on the low side
fence under the ailantus tree then began. Next, I was obliged to give up growing roses, because,
as you know, they are fresh-air lovers; and so much air and light was cut off by the high building
that they yielded only leaves and worms. Still I struggled, and adapted myself to new conditions,
and grew more of the stronger summer bedding plants.

"Five days ago I heard a banging and pounding. Only that morning Lucy had been told that the
low, rambling carpenter's shop, that occupied a double lot along the 'street to the southwest,
had been sold, and we anxiously waited developments. We were spared long suspense; for, on
hearing the noise, and going to the little tea-room extension where I keep my winter plants,
I saw a horde of men rapidly demolishing the shop, under directions of a superintendent, who
was absolutely sitting on top of my honeysuckle trellis. After swallowing six times,--a trick
father once taught me to cure explosive speech,--I went down and asked him if he could tell
me to what use the lot was to be put. He replied: 'My job is only to clean it up; but the plans
call for a twelve-story structure,--warehouse, I guess. But you needn't fret; it's to be fireproof.'

"'Fireproof! What do I care?' I cried, gazing around my poor garden--or rather I must have
fairly snorted, for he looked down quickly and took in the situation at a glance, gave a whistle
and added: 'I see, you'll be planted in; but, marm, that's what's got to happen in a pushing
city--it don't stop even for graveyards, but just plants 'em in.'

"My afternoon sun gone. Not for one minute in the day will its light rest on my garden, and
finis is already written on it, and I see it an arid mud bank. I wonder if you can realize,
you open-air Barbara, with your garden and fields and all space around you, how a city-bred
woman, to whom crowds are more vital than nature, still loves her back yard. I had a cockney
nature calendar planted in mine, that began with a bunch of snowdrops, ran through hot poppy
days, and ended in a glow of chrysanthemums, but all the while I worked among these I felt
the breath of civilization about me and the solid pavement under my feet.

"I believe that every woman primarily has concealed in the three rounded corners of her heart,
waiting development, love of home, love of children, and love of nature, and my nature love
has yet only developed to the size of a back yard.

"Yes, I will come to visit you at Oaklands gladly, though it's a poor compliment under the
circumstances. The mother of twins should be gone to; but tremble! you may never get rid of
me, for I may supplant Martha Corkle, the miraculous, in spoiling the boys."

       *       *       *       *       *

"February 1st.

"One more question to answer and this budget of letters will go to the post with at least four
stamps on it, for since you have yoked me to a stub pen and begged me not to criss-cross the
sheets, my bills for stamps and stationery have increased.

"Sylvia Latham is the daughter of your Bluff people. Her father's name is Sylvester Johns Latham,
and he is a Wall Street broker and promoter, with a deal of money, and ability for pulling
the wires, but not much liked socially, I should judge,--that is, outside of a certain commercial
group.

"Mrs. Latham was, at the time of her marriage, a pretty southern girl, Vivian Carhart, with
only a face for a fortune. In a way she is a beautiful woman now, has quite a social following,
a gift for entertaining, and, I judge, unbounded vanity and ambition.

"Quite recently some apparently valueless western land, belonging to her people, has developed
fabulous ore, and they say that she is now more opulent than her husband.

"They were pewholders at St. Jacob's for many years, until three seasons ago, when they moved
from a side street near Washington Square to 'Millionaire Row,' on the east side of the Park.
There are two children, Sylvia, the younger, and a son, Carhart, a fine-looking blond fellow
when I knew him, but who got into some bad scrape the year after he left college,--a gambling
debt, I think, that his father repudiated, and sent him to try ranch life in the West. There
was a good deal of talk at the time, and it was said that the boy fell into bad company at
his mother's own card table, and that it has caused a chilliness between Mr. and Mrs. Latham.

"However it may be, Sylvia, who is an unspoiled girl of the frank and intellectual type, tall,
and radiant with warm-hearted health, was kept much away at boarding-school for three years,
and then went to college for a special two years' course in literature. She had barely returned
home when her mother, hearing that I was going abroad, asked me to take Sylvia with me, as
she was deficient in languages, which would be a drawback to her social career.

"It seemed a trifle strange to me, as she was then nineteen, an age when most girls of her
class are brought out, and had been away for practically five years. But I took her gladly,
and she has been a most lovable companion and friend. She called me Aunt, to overcome the formal
Miss, and I wish she were my daughter. I'm only wondering if her high, unworldly standpoint,
absorbed from wise teachers, and the halo that she has constructed from imagination and desire
about her parents during the years of her separation from them, will not embarrass them a little,
now that she is at home for good.

"By the way, we met in England last spring a young sub-professor, Horace Bradford, a most unusual
young man for nowadays, but of old New England stock. He was one of Sylvia's literature instructors
at Rockcliffe College, and he joined our party during the month we spent in the Shakespeare
country. It was his first trip, and, I take it, earned by great self-sacrifice; and his scholarly
yet boyish enthusiasm added hugely to our enjoyment.

"He spoke constantly of his mother. Do you know her? She lives on the old place, which was
a farm of the better class, I take it, his father having been the local judge, tax collector,
and general consulting factotum of his county. It is at Pine Ridge Centre, which, if I remember
rightly, is not far from your town. I should like you to know him.

"I have only seen Sylvia twice since our return, but she lunches with me to-morrow. You and
she should be fast friends, for she is of your ilk; and if this happens, I shall not regret
the advent of the Whirlpool Colony in your beloved Oaklands as much as I do now.

"I am really beginning to look forward to my country visit, and am glad to see that some 'advance
season' tops are spinning on the pavement in front of the house, and a game of marbles is in
progress in my front yard itself, safe from the annoying skirts of passers-by. For you should
know, dear Madam Pan, that marbles and tops are the city's first spring sign.

"By the way, I am sure that Horace Bradford and Sylvia are keeping up a literary correspondence.
They are perfectly suited to each other for any and every grade of friendship, yet from her
family standpoint no one could be more unwelcome. He has no social backing; his mother is a
religious little country woman, who doubtless says 'riz' and 'reckon,' and he only has what
he can earn by mental effort. But this is neither here nor there, and I'm sure you and I will
have an interesting summer croon in spite of your qualms and resentment of the moneyed invasion.--Not
another word, Lucy is waiting to take this to the post-box.

"Yours faithfully,

"LAVINIA DORMAN.

"P. S.--Josephus has just come back! Lean, and singed by hot ashes, I judge. I dread the shock
to him when he knows about the yard!"

III

MARTIN CORTRIGHT'S LETTERS TO BARBARA AND DOCTOR RICHARD RUSSELL

"December 10, 19--.

"MY DEAR BARBARA:--

"You have often asked me to write you something of myself, my youth, but where shall I begin?

"I sometimes think that I must have been born facing backward, and a fatality has kept me walking
in that direction ever since, so wide a space there seems to be to-day between myself and those
whose age shows them to be my contemporaries.

"My father, being a man of solid position both in commerce and society, and having a far greater
admiration for men of art and letters than would have been tolerated by his wholly commercial
Knickerbocker forbears, I, his youngest child and only son, grew up to man's estate among the
set of contemporaries that formed his world, men of literary and social parts, whose like I
may safely say, for none will contradict, are unknown to the rising generation of New Yorkers;
for not only have types changed, but also the circumstances and appreciations under which the
development of those types was possible.

"In my nineteenth year events occurred that altered the entire course of my life, for not only
did the almost fatal accident and illness that laid me low bar my study of a profession, but
it rendered me at the same time, though I did not then realize it, that most unfortunate of
beings, the semi-dependent son of parents whose overzeal to preserve a boy's life that is precious,
causes them to deprive him of the untrammelled manhood that alone makes the life worth living.

"I always had a bent for research, a passion for following the history of my country and city
to its fountain heads. I devoured old books, journals, and the precious documents to which
my father had ready access, that passed from the attic treasure chests of the old houses in
decline to the keeping of the Historical Society. As a lad I besought every gray head at my
father's table to tell me a story, so what more natural, under the circumstances, than that
my father should make me free of his library, and say: 'I do not expect or desire you to earn
your living; I can provide for you. Here are companions, follow your inclinations, live your
own life, and do not be troubled by outside affairs.' At first I was too broken in health and
disappointed in ambition to rebel, then inertia became a habit.

"As my health unexpectedly improved and energy moved me to reassert myself and step out, a
soft hand was laid on mine--the hand of my mother, invalided at my birth, retired at forty
from a world where she had shone by force of beauty and wit--and a gentle voice would say:
'Stay with me, my son, my baby. Oh, bear with me a little longer. If you only knew the comfort
it is to feel that you are in the house, to hear your voice. You will pen a history some day
that will bring you fame, and you will read it to me here--we two, all alone in my chamber,
before the world hears it.' So I stayed on. How mother love often blinds the eyes to its own
selfishness.

"That fatal twentieth year, the time of my overthrow, brought me one good gift, your father's
friendship. It was a strange chance, that meeting, and it was my love of hearing of past events
and the questions concerning them that brought it about. Has your father ever told you of it?

"Likely not, for his life work has been the good physician's, to bring forth and keep alive,
and mine the antiquarian's, dreaming and groping among ruins for doubtful treasure of fallen walls.

"My mother came of English, not Knickerbocker stock like my father, though both belong distinctly
to New York; and female education being in a somewhat chaotic state between the old regime
and new, her parents, desirous of having her receive the genteel polish of courtly manners,
music, and dancing, sent her, when about fifteen, to Mrs. Rowson's school, then located at
Hollis Street, Boston. The fame of this school had travelled far and wide, for not only had
the preceptress in her youth, as Susanna Haswell, been governess to the children of the beautiful
Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire, one of the most accomplished women of her day, and profited
by her fine taste, but her own high morals and literary gifts made her tutorship a much sought
privilege.

"While there my mother met the little New England girl who was long afterward to become your
grandmother. She had also come to study music, for which she had a talent. My mother related
to me, when I was a little lad and used to burrow in her carved oak treasure chest and beg
for stories of the articles it contained, many fascinating tales of those two school years,
a pretty colour coming to her cheeks as she told of the dances learned together, pas-de-deux
and minuet, from old 'Doctor' Shaffer, who was at the time second violin of the Boston Theatre,
as well as authority in the correct methods of bowing and courtesying for gentlewomen. Your
grandmother married first, and the letter telling of it was stored away with others in the
oak chest.

"Some months before the steamboat accident that shattered my nerves, and preceded the long
illness, I was browsing at a bookstall, on my way up from college homeward, when I came across
a copy of Charlotte Temple--one of the dozen later editions--printed in New York by one R.
Hobbs, in 1827, its distinguishing interest lying in a frontispiece depicting Charlotte's flight
from Portsmouth.

"The story had long been a familiar one, and I, in common with others of many times my age
and judgment, had lingered before the slab that bears her name in the graveyard of old Trinity,
and sometimes laid a flower on it for sympathy's sake, as I have done many times since.

"On my return home I showed the little book to my mother, and as she held it in her hinds and
read a word here and there, she too began to journey backward to her school days, and asked
my father to bring out her treasure chest, and from it she took her school relics,--a tattered
ribbon watch-guard fastened by a flat gold buckle that Mrs. Rowson had given her as a reward
for good conduct, and a package of letters. She spent an hour reading these, and old ties strengthened
as she read. I can see her now as she sat bolstered by pillows in her reclining chair, a writing
tray upon her knees, penning a long letter.

"A few months afterward, as I lay in my bed too weak even to stir, your father stood there,
looking across the footboard at me,--the answer to that letter. Your father, tall and strong
of body and brain, a Harvard graduate drawn to New York to study medicine at the College of
Physicians and Surgeons. His eyes of strengthening manly pity looked into mine and drew me
slowly back to life with them.

"His long absence as surgeon in the Civil War, the settling down as a country doctor, and even
loving the same woman, has not separated us. Never more than a few months passed but our thoughts
met on paper, or our hands clasped. His solicitude in a large measure restored my health, so
that at sixty-three, physically, I can hold my own with any man of my age, and to-day I walk
my ten miles with less ado than many younger men. Because of my intense dislike of the modern
means of street transportation, I have kept on walking ever since the time that your father
and I footed it from Washington Park to Van Cortlandt Manor, through the muskrat marshes whereon
the park plaza now stands, up through the wilds of the future Central Park, McGowan's Pass,
and northwestward across the Harlem to our destination. He will recollect. We were two days
picking our way in going and two days on the return, for we scorned the 'bus route, and that
was only in the later fifties. Never mind, if we ever do get back to small clothes and silk
stockings, Martin Cortright can show a rounded calf, if he has been esteemed little more than
a crawling bookworm these many years.

"Methinks I hear you yawn and crumple these sheets together in your hand, saying: 'What ails
the man--is he grown doity? I thought he was contented, even if sluggishly serene.'

"And so he was, as one grown used to numbness, until last summer one Mistress Barbara visited
the man-snail in his shell and exorcised him to come forth for an outing, to feed among fresh
green leaves and breathe the perfume of flowers and young lives. When lo and behold, on the
snail's return, the shell had grown too small!

"Faithfully,

"M. C."

(To R. R.)

"December 22, 19--.

"So social change has also cast its shadow across even your country pathway, dear Hippocrates?
I wish it had spared you, but I feared as much when I heard that your peaceful town had been
invaded by an advance guard of those same People of the Whirlpool who keep the social life
of their own city in a ferment.

"You ask what is the matter, what the cause of the increasing restlessness that appears on
every side, driving the conservative thinking class of moderate means to seek home shelter
beyond city limits, and drawing the rest into a swirl that, sooner or later, either casts them
forth as wrecks or sucks them wholly down.

"The question is difficult of answer, but there are two things that are potent causes of the
third. Money too quickly earned, or rather won, causes an unwise expansion, and a fictitious
prosperity that has degraded the life standard. Except in exclusively academic circles, the
man is gauged by his power of financial purchase and control, and the dollar is his hall mark.
He is forced to buy, not win, his way. Of course, if pedigree and private character correspond
in quantity, so much the better, but their importance is strictly held in abeyance.

"Even in the legendary classic shades of learning, the cold pressure of the golden thumb crowds
down and chills penniless brains. All students do not have equal chance and equal rights. How
can they, when the exclusiveness of many fraternities is not by intellectual gauge or the capability
for comradeship, but the power to pay high dues and spend lavishly. Of later years, in several
conspicuous cases, even the choice of college officials of high control has been guided rather
by their capacity as financiers than for ripened and inspiring scholarship.

"Then, too, the rack of constant change is detrimental to the finer grade of civic sentiment.
It would seem that the Island's significant Indian name was wrought into its physical construction
like the curse that kept the Jew of fable a wanderer. Periodically the city is rent and upheaved
in unison with the surrounding changes of tide. Here one does not need to live out his threescore
years and ten to see the city of his youth slip away from him. Even his Alma Mater packs her
trunks and moves about too rapidly to foster the undying loyal home spirit among her sons--my
college has lived in three houses since my freshman year. How I envy the sons of Harvard, Yale,
and all the rest who can go back, and, feeling at least a scrap of the old campus turf beneath
their feet, close their eyes and be young again for one brief minute. Is not this the reason
why so many of Columbia's sons, in spite of the magnificent opportunities she offers, send
their sons elsewhere, because they realize the value of associations they have missed, and
recognize the Whirlpool's changefulness?

"What would be the feelings of an Oxford man, on returning from his life struggle in India
or Australia, to visit his old haunts, if he found, as a sign of vaunted progress, the Bodleian
Library turned into an apartment house!

"The primal difference between civilized men and the nameless savage is love of home, and the
powerful races are those in whom this instinct is the strongest. Such fealty is not born in
the shifting almost tent-dwellers of Manhattan.

"It was in the late seventies, the winter before his passing, that one mild night I walked
home from a meeting of the Goethe Club in company with the poet Bryant. He and my father had
been stanch comrades, and many a time had I studied his Homeric head silhouetted by firelight
on our library wall. As we crossed the Park front going from Fifth Avenue east to west, he
paused, and leaning on his cane gazed skyward, where the outlines of some buildings, in process
of construction on Fifty-ninth Street, and then considered high, stood out against the sky.
"'Poor New York,' he said, half to himself, half to me, 'created and yet cramped by force of
her watery boundaries, where shall her sons and daughters find safe dwelling-places? They have
covered the ground with their habitations, and even now they are climbing into the sky.' And
he went on leaving his question unanswered.

       *       *       *       *       *

"A caller interrupted me yesterday, a most persistent fellow and a dangerous one to the purse
of the tyro collector of Americana, though not to me. He was a man of some pretence to classic
education, and superficially versed in lore of title, date, and editio princeps. He had half
a dozen prints of rarity and value had they not been forgeries, and a book ... that I had long
sought after in its original form, but the only copy I had seen for many years when put up
at auction lacked the title page and fully half a dozen leaves, besides having some other defects.
Would you believe it, Dick, this copy was that from the auction, its defects repaired, its
missing leaves replaced by careful forgery, and what is more, I know the vender was aware of
the deceit. But he will sell it to some young moneyed sprig who will not know.

"I was angry, Dick, very angry, and yet all this is a trivial part of what we have a long time
been discussing. The sudden glint of wealth in certain quarters has changed the aspect of even
book collecting, that once most individual of occupations, and syndicated it.

"Once a book collection was the natural accumulation, more or less perfect according to purse
and opportunity, of one following a certain line of thought, and bore the stamp of individuality;
but as these bibliophiles of the old regime pass away, the ranks are recruited by men to whom
money is of no account, whose competition forces irrational prices and creates false values.
Methinks I see the finish of the small collectors like ourselves. Meanwhile, just so much intellectual
pleasure is wrested from the modern scholar of small means who dares not make beginning. I
do not like it, Dick, indeed I do not.

"But we were discussing domesticity, I think, when this wretch rang the bell. The restlessness
I speak of as born of undisciplined bigness, of moneyed magnitude, is visible everywhere, and
more so in the hours of relaxation than those of business.

"We have acquired the knowledge of many arts in these late years, and we needed it; but we
have lost one that is irreparable--sociality. There is no longer time to know oneself, how
then shall we know our neighbours?

"The verb to entertain has largely driven the verb to enjoy from the social page. It is not
too extreme, I think, to say the home and playhouse have changed places. Many conservative
people that I know turn to the theatre as the only safe means of relaxation and enjoyment within
their reach, the stress and penalty of criticism in entertaining modern company being unbearable
to them.

"To the bachelor who, like myself, has a modest hearthstone, yet no hand but his own to stir
the fire, the dinner tables of his married friends and his clubs have been supposed to replace,
in a measure at least, the need of family ties. Once they did this as far as such things may,
but the easy sociality of the family board has almost ceased, and the average club has so expanded
that it savours more of hotel freedom than home cosiness.

"I am not a misanthrope or a woman hater, as you know, yet from what I gather I fear that,
in the upper middle class at least, it is the women who are responsible for this increased
formality that most men naturally would avoid. Led by personal ambition, or that of young daughters,
they seek to maintain a standard just enough beyond their easy grasp to feel ill at ease, if
not humiliated, to be caught off guard. I remember once when I was a mere boy hearing my father
say in a sorrowing tone to my eldest sister, who was giving fugitive reasons for not being
able to array herself quickly for some festivity for which the invitation had been delayed,
yet to which she longed to go: 'Wherever woman enters socially, then complications begin that
are wholly of her own making. I warrant before Eve had finished her fig-leaf petticoat she
was bothering Adam to know if he thought there could be another woman anywhere who had a garment
of rarer leaves than her own.'

"The clubs do somewhat better, being under male management, but those among them that ranked
as so conservative that membership was the hall mark of intellectual acquirements and stamped
a man as either author, artist, or amateur of letters and the fine arts, have had their doors
pushed open by many of those who wish to wear in public the name of being without good right,
and so the little groups of kindred spirits have broken away, the authors in one direction,
the followers of the drama to habitations of their own, artists who are too independent to
be overborne by money in another, and thus the splitting spirit increases until it vanishes
in a maze of cliques and coteries. The names may stand on the lists, the faces are absent,
and one must wander through half a dozen clubs to really meet the aggregation of thinkers and
workers of the grade who gathered in the snug corners of the Century's old club house in East
Fifteenth Street when we were young fellows, and my father secured us cards for an occasional
monthly meeting as the greatest favour he could do us.

"Come down if you can, take a holiday, or rather night, and go with me to the January meeting,
and we will also stroll among some of our old haunts. You may perhaps realize, what I cannot
altogether explain, the reason why I feel almost a stranger though at home."

       *       *       *       *       *

(To DR. R. R.)

"January 10, 19--.

"Could not get away, you conscientious old Medicus, because of the strange accidents and holiday
doings of the Whirlpool Colony at the Bluffs!

"Well, well! I read your last with infinite amusement. You are in a fair way to have enlightenment
borne in upon you without leaving your surgery, or at least travelling farther than your substantial
gig will take you.

"Meanwhile I have had what should be a crushing blow to my vanity, and in analyzing it I've
made an important discovery. One night last week I was sitting quietly in the card room at
the Dibdin Club, awaiting my whist mates (for here at least one may be reasonably sure of finding
a group with bibliographic interests in common, and the pleasures of a non-commercial game
of cards), when I heard a voice, one of a group outside, belonging to a wholesome, smooth-faced
young fellow, with good tastes and instincts, say:--

"'I don't know what happened to the old boy when he took that unheard-of vacation of his last
fall, or where he went, but one thing's very sure, since his return Cortright's grown pudgy
and he's waked bang up. Wonder if he's finished that Colonial History, that's to be his monument,
he's been working on all his life, or if he's fallen in love?'

"'If he'd fall in love, he might stand more chance of finishing his history,' replied a graybeard
friend in deep didactic tones; 'he has material in plenty, but no vital stimulus for focussing
his work.'

"I gave an unpremeditated laugh that dwindled to a chuckle, as if it were produced by a choking
process. Two heads appeared a second at the doorway of the room they had thought empty, and
then vanished!

"When I came home I sat a long while before my den fireplace thinking. They were right in two
things, though not in the falling in love--that was done thirty-five years ago once and for
all. I wondered if I had grown pudgy, dreadful word; stout carries a certain dignity, but pudgy
suggests bunchy, wabbling flesh. I've noticed my gloves go on lingeringly, clinging at the
joints, but I read that to mean rheumatism!

"That night I stood before the mirror and studied my face as I unbuttoned my vest and loosened
my shirt band at the neck. Suddenly I experienced great relief. For several months past I have
felt a strange asphyxiation and a vertigo sensation when wearing formal clothes of any kind,
enjoying complete comfort only in the loose neckcloth and wrapper of my private hours. I had
thought of asking medical advice, but having acquired a distrust of general physic in my youth,
and hoping you might come down, I put it off.

"Unfasten your own top button, and now prepare to laugh--Martin Cortright is not threatened
with apoplexy or heart failure, he's grown pudgy, and his clothes are all too small! Yet but
for that boy's good-tempered ridicule he might not have discovered it.

"Think of it, Richard! I, whom my mother considered interesting and of somewhat distinguished
mien, owing to my pallor and slim stature! A pudgy worm belongs to chestnuts, not to books.
A pudgy antiquarian is a thing unheard of since monastic days, when annal making was not deemed
out of place if mingled with the rotund jollity of a Friar Tuck. You must bear half the blame,
for it must be the butter habit that your Martha Corkle's fresh churned pats inoculated me
with, for I always detested the stuff before.

"Graybeard's stricture, however, struck a deeper chord--'He has material in plenty for his
book, but no vital stimulus.' This, too, is deeply true, and I have felt it vaguely so for
some time, but no more realized it than I did my pudginess.

"No matter how much material one collects, if the vitalizing spirit is not there, no matter
how realistically the stage may be set if the actors are mere dummies. The only use of the
past is to illuminate and sustain the present.

"Your own home life and work, the honest questions of little Richard and Ian waken me from
a long sleep, I believe, and set me thinking. What is a man remembered by the longest? Brain
work, memorial building, or heart touching? Do you recollect once meeting old Moore--Clement
Clark Moore--at my father's? He was a profound scholar in Greek and Hebrew lexicology, and
gave what was once his country house and garden in old Chelsea Village to the theological seminary
of his professorship. How many people remember this, or his scholarship? But before that old
rooftree was laid low, he wrote beneath it, quite offhand, a little poem, 'The Night Before
Christmas,' that blends with childhood's dreams anew each Christmas Eve--a few short verses
holding more vitality than all his learning.

"If my book ever takes body, my friend, it will be under your roof, where you and yours can
vitalize it. This is no fishing for invitations--we know each other too frankly well for that.
What I wish to do is to come into your neighbourhood next springtime, without encroaching on
your hospitality, and work some hours every day in the library, or that corner of her charmed
attic that Barbara has shared with me. It is bewitching. Upon my word, I do not wonder that
she sees the world rose-colour as she looks upon it from that window. I, too, had long reveries
there, in which experience and tradition mixed themselves so cleverly that for the time I could
not tell whether it was my father or myself who had sometimes proudly escorted the lovely Carroll
sisters upon their afternoon promenade down Broadway, from Prince Street to the Bowling Green,
each leading her pet greyhound by a ribbon leash, or which of us it was that, in seeking to
recapture an escaping hound, was upset by it in the mud, to the audible delight of some rivals
in a 'bus and his own discomfiture, being rendered thereby unseemly for the beauty's further
company."

       *       *       *       *       *

"January 20, 19--.

"Thank you, dear Richard, for your brotherly letter. I make no protestations, for I know your
invitation would not be given if you felt my presence would in any way be a drawback or impose
care on any member of your household, and the four little hearts that Barbara drew, with her
own, Evan's, and the boys' initials in them, are seals upon the invitation.

"Do not deplore, however, the lack of nearness of my haunts in Astor and Lenox libraries. Times
are changed, and the new order condemns me to sit here if I read, there if I take out pencil
and pad to copy--the red tape distracts me. The old Historical Society alone remains in comfortable
confusion, and that is soon to move upward half a day's walk.

"But, as it chances, you have collected many of the volumes that are necessary to me, and I
will use them freely, for some day, friend of mine, my books will be joined to yours, and also
feel the touch of little Richard's and Ian's fingers, and of their sons, also, I hope.

"I declare, I'm growing childishly expectant and impatient for spring, like Barbara with her
packages of flower seeds.

"You ask if I ever remember meeting one Lavinia Dorman. I think I used to see her with a bevy
of girls from Miss Black's school, who used sometimes to attend lectures at the Historical
Society rooms, and had an unlimited appetite for the chocolate and sandwiches that were served
below in the 'tombs' afterward, which appetite I may have helped to appease, for you know father
was always a sort of mine host at those functions.

"The girls must have all been eight or ten years my junior, and you know how a fellow of twenty-three
or four regards giggling schoolgirls--they seem quite like kittens to him.

"Stop, was she one of the older girls, the special friend of--Barbara's mother? If so, I remember
her face, though she did not walk in the school procession with the other 'convicts,' as the
boys called them; but I was never presented.

"I'm sending a small birthday token to the boys--a little printing-press. Richard showed no
small skill in setting the letters of my rubber stamp. It is some days late, but that will
separate it from the glut of the Christmas market. Ask Evan to notify me if he and Barbara
go to town.

"Gratefully,

"M. C."

IV

WHEN BARBARA GOES TO TOWN

March 4. I like to go to a plain people's play, where the spectators groan and hiss the villain.
It is a wholesome sort of clearing house where one may be freed from pent-up emotion under
cover of other people's tears and smiles; the smiles triumphing at the end, which always winds
up with a sudden recoil, leaving the nerves in a healthy thrill. I believe that I can only
comprehend the primal emotions and what is called in intellectual jargon mental dissipation,
and the problem play, in its many phases, appeals to me even less than crude physical dissipation.

We have seen a drama of the people played quite recently, having been to New York to spend
part of a "midwinter" week's vacation, which father insisted that Evan should take between
two rather complex and eye-straining pieces of work. Speaking by the almanac, it wasn't midwinter
at all, but pre-spring, which, in spite of lengthening days, is the only uncompromisingly disagreeable
season in the country--the time when measles usually invades the village school, the dogs come
slinking in guiltily to the fire, pasted with frozen mud, the boys have snuffle colds, in spite
of father's precautions, and I grow desperate and flout the jonquils in my window garden, it
seems so very long since summer, and longer yet to real budding spring. We arrived at home
last night in the wildest snowstorm of the season, and this morning Evan, having smoothed out
his mental wrinkles by means of our mild city diversions, is now filling his lungs and straightening
his shoulders by building a wonderful snow fort for the boys. Presently I shall go down to
help them bombard him in it, and try to persuade them that it will last longer if they do not
squeeze the snowballs too hard, for Evan has prohibited "baking" altogether.

The "baking" of snowballs consists of making up quite a batch at once, then dipping them in
water and leaving them out until they are hard as rocks, and really wicked missiles.

The process, unknown in polite circles here, though practised by the factory town "muskrats,"
was taught my babies by the Vanderveer boy during the Christmas holidays, which, being snowy
and bright, drew the colony to the Bluffs for coasting, skating, etc., giving father such a
river of senseless accidents to wade through that he threatens to absent himself and take refuge
with Martin Cortright in his Irving Place den for holiday week next year. Father has ridden
many a night when the roads would not admit of wheeling, without thought of complaint, to the
charcoal camp to tend a new mother, a baby, or a woodchopper suddenly stricken with pneumonia,
that is so common a disease among men living as these do on poor food, in tiny close cabins,
and continually getting checks of perspiration in the variable climate. During the holidays
he was called to the Bluffs in the middle of two consecutive nights, first to the Vanderveers,
and requested to "drug" the second assistant butler, who was wildly drunk, and being a recent
acquisition had been brought to officiate at the house party without due trial, "so that he
wouldn't be used up the next day," and then to the Ponsonby's, where the family had evidently
not yet gone to bed. Here he found that the patient, a visiting school friend of one of the
daughters, from up the state, and evidently not used to the whirl of the pool, had skated all
day, and, kept going by unaccustomed stimulants, taken half from ignorance, half from bravado,
had danced the evening through at the club house, and then collapsed. Her hostess, careless
through familiarity with it, had given her a dose of one of the chloral mixtures "to let her
have a good night's sleep"; but instead it had sent her into hysterics, and she was calling
wildly for her mother to come and take her home. Father returned from both visits fairly white
with rage. Not at the unfortunates themselves, be it said, but at the cool nonchalance of those
who summoned him.

The butler's was a common enough case. That of the young girl moved him to pity, and then indignation,
as he sifted, out the cause of the attack, in order to treat her intelligently. This questioning
Mrs. Ponsonby resented most emphatically, telling him "to attend to his business and not treat
ladies as if they were criminals." This to a man of father's professional ability, and one
of over sixty years of age in the bargain.

"Madam," said he, "you are a criminal; for to my thinking all preventable illness, such as
this, is a crime. Leave the room, and when I have soothed this poor child I will go home; and
remember, do not send for me again; it will be useless."

Never a word did he say of the matter at home, though I read part in his face; but the Ponsonby's
housekeeper, a countrywoman of Martha Corkle's, took the news to her, adding "and the missus
stepped lively too, she did; only, law's sakes, by next mornin' she'd forgot all about it,
and, we being short-handed, wanted me to go down with James and get the Doctor up to spray
her throat for a hoarseness, and I remindin' her what he'd said, she laughed and answered,
'He had a bear's manners,' but to go tell him she'd pay him city prices, and she bet that would
mend him and them!"

I took good care not to repeat this to father, for he would be wounded. He is beginning to
see that they use him as a sort of ambulance surgeon, but he does not yet understand the absolute
money insolence of these people to those not of their "set," whom they consider socially or
financially beneath them, and I hope he never may. He is so full of good will to all men, so
pitiful toward weakness and sin, and has kept his faith in human nature through thirty-five
years' practice in a factory town, hospital wards, charcoal camp, and among the odd characters
of the scattering hillsides, that it would be an undying shame to have it shattered by the
very people that the others regard with hopeless envy.

Shame on you, Barbara, but you are growing bitter. Yes, I know you do not yourself mind left-handed
snubs and remarks about your being "comfortably poor," but you won't have that splendid old
father of yours put upon and sneezed at, with cigarette sneezes, too. You should realize that
they don't know any better, also that presently they may become dreadfully bored after the
manner of degenerates and move away from the Bluffs, and then companionable, commuting, or
summer resident people will have a chance to buy their houses.

Shrewd Martha Corkle foresaw the probable outcome the day that the foundation-stone for the
first cottage was laid, even before our prettiest flower-hedged lane was shorn and torn up
to make it into a macadam road, in order to shorten the time, for motor vehicles, between the
Bluffs and the station by possibly three minutes. Not that the people were obliged to be on
time for early trains, for they are mostly the reapers of other people's sowing; but to men
of a certain calibre, born for activity, the feeling that, simply for the pleasure of it, they
can wait until the very latest moment and still get there, is an amusement savouring of both
chance and power.

"Yes, Mrs. Evan," said Martha, with as much of a sniff as she felt compatible with her dignity,
"I knows colernies of folks not born to or loving the soil, but just trying to get something
temporary out o' it in the way o' pleasure, as rabbits, or mayhap bad smelling water for the
rheumatics. (It was the waters Lunnon swells came for down on the old estate.) To my thinkin'
these pleasure colernies is bad things; they settles as senseless as a swarm of bees, just
because their leader's lit there first; and when they've buzzed themselves out and moved on,
like as not some sillies as has come gapin' too close is bit fatal or poisoned for life."

Well-a-day! Evan says that I take things to heart that belong to the head alone, while father
says that, to his mind, feeling is much more of a need to-day than logic; so what can I do
but still stumble along according to feeling.

A shout from beneath the window, then a soft snowball on it, the signal that the fort is finished,--yes,
and the old Christmas tree stuck up top as a standard. Richard has built a queer-looking snow
man with red knobs all over his chest and stomach, while Ian has achieved several most curious
looking things with carrot horns,--whatever are they? Father has just driven in, and is laughing
heartily, and Evan is waving to me.

       *       *       *       *       *

Calm reigns again. The fort has surrendered, the final charge having been led by Corney Delaney.
We've had hot milk all around, father has retired to the study to decipher a complicated letter
from Aunt Lot, Evan has taken the boys into the den for a drawing lesson, and the mystery of
the snow man is solved.

We do not intend to have the boys learn any regular lessons before another fall, but for the
last two years I have managed that they should sit still and be occupied with something every
morning, so that they may learn how to keep quiet without its being a strain,--shelling peas,
cutting papers for jelly pots, stringing popcorn for the hospital Christmas tree, seeding raisins
with a dozen for pay at the end--this latter is an heroic feat when it is accomplished without
drawing the pay on the instalment plan--and many other little tasks, varied according to season.

Ian has a quick eye and comprehension, and he is extremely colour sensitive, but healthily
ignorant of book learning, while Richard, how we do not know, has learned to read in a fashion
of his own, not seeming yet to separate letters or words, but "swallowing the sense in lumps,"
as Martha puts it.

Yesterday, before our return, the weather being threatening, and the boys, keyed for mischief,
clamouring and uneasy, very much as birds and animals are before a storm, father invited them
to spend the afternoon with him in the study, and Martha Corkle, who mounts guard during my
brief holidays, saw that their paws were scrubbed, and then relaxed her vigilance, joining
Evan in the sewing room.

After many three-cornered discussions as to what liberty was to be allowed the boys in study
and den, we decided that when they learned to respect books in the handling they should be
free to browse as they pleased; the curiosities, rarities, and special professional literature,
being behind glass doors, could easily be protected by lock and key. Father's theory is that
if you want children to love books, no barriers must be interposed from the beginning, and
that being so much with us the boys will only understand what is suited to their age, and therefore
the harmful will pass them by. I was never shut from the library shelves, or mysteries made
about the plain-spoken literature of other days, in spite of Aunt Lot's fuming. I did not understand
it, so it did not tempt, and as I look back, I realize that the book of life was spread before
me wisely and gradually, father turning page after page, then passing the task to Evan, so
that I never had a shock or disillusionment.

I wonder if mother had lived if I should think differently, and be more apprehensive about
the boys, womanwise? I think not; for I am a sun-loving Pagan all through, really born far
back in an overlooked corner of Eden, and I prefer the forceful father influence that teaches
one to overcome rather than the mother cult which is to bear, for so much is cumbrously borne
in self-glorified martyrdom by women of their own volition.

I know that I am very primitive in my instincts and emotions; so are the boys, and that keeps
us close, or so close, together.

Of course illustrated books are now the chief attraction to them in the library, and yesterday,
when father went there with the boys, he supplied Ian, as usual, with "The Uncivilized Races
of Man," which always opens of itself at the Mumbo Jumbo picture, and as a great treat for
Richard, took down the three quarto volumes of Audubon's "Quadrupeds," and ranged them on a
low stand with a stool in front of it. Then, being tired after a hard morning's work, he drew
his big leather chair near the, fire, put on an extra log, and proceeded to--meditate. You
will doubtless notice that when father or husband close their eyes, sitting in comfortable
chairs by the fire, they are always meditating, and never sleeping, little nosey protestations
to the contrary.

Father's meditations must have been long and deep, for when he was startled from them by the
breaking in two of the hickory log, a gory spectacle met his eyes.

Richard was sitting on the hearth rug, which he had carefully covered with newspapers; these,
as well as his hands and face, were stained a deep crimson, while with a stout silver fruit-knife
he was hacking pieces from a great pulpy red mass before him.

Checking an exclamation of horror father started forward, to meet Richard's cheerful, frank
gaze and the request, as he dug away persistently, to "Please wait one minute more, dranpa.
I've got the heart all done, that big floppy piece is lungs, an' I've most made the liver.
Not the good kind that goes wif curly bacon, but a nasty one like what we wear inside."

Then spying a medical chart with coloured pictures that was propped up against the wood box,
father found the clew, and comprehended that Richard was giving himself a practical lesson
in anatomy by trying to carve these organs from a huge mangel wurzel beet that he had rolled
in from the root cellar. Did father scold him for mess-making, or laugh at his attempt that
had little shape except in his own baby brain?

No, neither; he carefully closed the door against Martha's possible entrance, seriously and
respectfully put the precious objects on a plate, to which he gave a place of honour on the
mantel shelf, and after removing as far as possible all traces of beet from face and hands
in his sacred office lavatory, he took Richard with him into the depths of the great chair
and told the happy child his favourite rigmarole, all about the "three gentlemen of high degree,"
who do our housework for us. How the lungs, who are Siamese twins, called to the heart to pump
them up some blood to air, because they were almost out of work, and how the big lazy liver
lay on one side and groaned because he had drunk too much coffee for breakfast, and had a headache,--until
Richard really felt that he had achieved something. So the first thing this morning he set
about making a snow man, that he might put the beet vitals in their proper places, nearly convulsing
father by their location. Though, as he told me, they were accurate, compared to the ideas
of many trained nurses with whom he had come in contact.

But where was Ian during the beet carving? Father quite forgot him until, Richard falling asleep
in his arms, he arose to tuck him up on the sofa. A sound of the slow turning of large pages
guided him to the corner by the bay window where some bookcases, standing back to back, made
a sort of alcove. There was Ian, flat upon his stomach, while before him the "Wandering Jew"
legend, with the Doré pictures, lay open at the final scene--The Last Judgment--where the Jew,
his journey over, looks up at the angels coming to greet him, while little devils pull vainly
at his tattered boots. It was not the Jew or the angels, however, that held Ian's attention,
and whose outlines he was tracing with his forefinger, but the devils, one big fellow with
cows' horns and wings drooping like those of a moulting crow, and a bevy of imps with young
horns and curly tails who were pulling a half-buried body toward the fiery pit by its hair.

Father explained the pictures in brief, and closed the book as quickly as possible, thinking
the boy might be frightened in his dreams by the demons. But no, Ian was fascinated, not frightened.
He would have liked the pygmies to come and play with him, and he turned to father with a sigh,
saying, "They're bully pullers, dranpop. I guess if they and me pulled against Corney Delaney
we could get him over the line all right," one of the boys' favourite pastimes being to play
tug-of-war with the goat, the rope being fastened to its horns, but Corney was always conqueror.

Neither did Ian forget the imps quickly, as some children do their impressions, but strove
to model them this morning, making round snow bodies, carrot horns, corncob legs, and funny
celery tails; the result being positively startling and "overmuch like witch brats," as Effie
declared, with bulging eyes.

They unfortunately did not perish with the fort, for Richard doesn't like them; but are now
huddled in a group under the old Christmas tree, where Lark is barking at them.

       *       *       *       *       *

I started to record our visit to Lavinia Dorman, but my "human documents," printed on vellum,
came between, and I would not miss a word they have to say for the "Mechlinia Albertus Magnus,"
which father says is the rarest book in the world, though Evan disputes his preference, and
Martin Cortright would doubtless prefer the first edition of Denton's "New York."

In past times, when we have visited Miss Lavinia, we have been fairly meek and decorous guests,
following the programme that she planned with such infinite attention to detail that free will
was impossible, and we often felt like paper dolls.

We had read her lament on the death of sociability and back yards with many a smile, and a
sigh also, for to one born in the pool, every ripple that stirs it must be of importance, and
it is impossible for outsiders to urge her to step out of the eddies altogether and begin anew,
for New Yorkitis seems to be not only a rarely curable disease to those who have it, but an
hereditary one as well.

As usual, Evan came to the rescue, as we sat in the den the night before our departure. "Let
us turn tables on Miss Lavinia this time and take her to see our New York," he said, "since
we are all quite tired of hers. Do you remember the time when we went to town to buy the trappings
for the boys' first tree and were detained until Christmas morning by the delay of a cable
I had to wait for? After dinner Christmas Eve we coaxed Miss Lavinia out with us and bought
half a bushel of jolly little toys from street fakirs to take home, and then boarded an elevated
train and rode about the city until after midnight, in and out the downtown streets and along
the outskirts, to see all the poor people's Christmas trees in the second stories of tenements,
cheap flats, and over little shops. How she enjoyed it, and said that she never dreamed that
tenement people could be so happy; and she finally waxed so enthusiastic that she gave a silver
half dollar each to four little newsboys crouching over the steam on a grating in Twenty-third
Street, and when they cheered her and a policeman came along, we told the dear old soul that
he evidently thought her a suspicious character, a counterfeiter at the very least. And she
always spoke afterward with bated breath on the dangers of the streets late at night, and her
narrow escape from arrest. We came to New York unsated and without responsibilities to push
us, and looked from the outside in.

"No, Barbara, you did better than you knew that day six years ago, when we sat in the Somerset
garden, and you persuaded me to become a commuter and let you plant a garden, promising never
to talk about servants, and you've kept your word. I was dubious then, but now--if you only
knew the tragedies I've seen among men of my means and aims these last few years, the struggle
to be in the swim, or rather the backwater of it. The disappointment, the debt and despair,
the pink teas and blue dinners given in cramped flats, the good fellows afraid to say no to
wives whose hearts are set on being thought 'in it,' and the wives, haggard and hollow-eyed
because the husbands wish to keep the pace by joining clubs that are supposedly the hall-marks
of the millionnaire. New York is the best place for doing everything in but three--to be born
in, to live in, and to die in."

"So you wish us to play bachelor girl and man for a few days, and herd Miss Lavinia about,
which I suppose is the pith of these heroics of yours," I said, rather astonished, for Evan
seldom preaches. "I never knew that you were such an anti-whirlpooler before, and I've at times
felt selfish about keeping you at the old home, though not since the boys came, it's so healthy
for them, bless them. Now I feel quite relieved," and I arranged a little crisp curl that will
break loose in spite of persistent wetting, for men always seem to discourage curly hair, father
keeping his shorn like a prize-fighter. This curl softens the rigour of Evan's horseshoe scowl,
and when I fix it gives him a chance to put his arm around my waist, which is the only satisfactory
way of discussing plans for a pleasure trip.

We arrived in town duly a little before dinner time. It is one of Evan's comfortable travelling
habits, this always arriving at a new place at the end of day, so as to get the bearings and
be adjusted when we awake next morning. To arrive in the morning, when paying a visit especially,
is reversing the natural order of things; you are absent-minded until lunch, sleepy all the
afternoon, dyspeptic at dinner, when, like as not, some one you have wholly forgotten or hoped
to is asked to meet you. If the theatre follows, you recuperate, but if it is cards (of which
I must have a prenatal hatred, it is so intense) with the apology, "I thought you might be
tired and prefer a cosey game of whist to going out," you trump your partner's tricks, lead
the short suits and mix clubs and spades with equal oblivion, and, finally, going to bed, leave
a bad impression behind that causes your hostess to say, strictly to herself, if she is charitable,
"How Barbara has deteriorated; she used to be a good talker, but then, poor dear, living in
the country is so narrowing."

Of course if you merely go away to spend the day it is different; you generally keep on the
move and go home to recover from it. And how men usually hate staying in other people's houses,
no matter how wide they keep their doors open or how hospitably inclined they may be themselves.
They seem to be self-conscious, and are constrained to alter their ordinary habits, which makes
them miserable and feel as if they had given up their free will and identity. There are only
two places that I ever dream of taking Evan, and Lavinia Dorman's is one of them.

When we had made ourselves smart for dinner and joined Miss Lavinia by the fire in her tiny
library, we read by her hair that she was evidently intending to stay at home that evening,
for her head has its nodes like the moon. She has naturally pretty, soft wavy hair, with now
and then a silver streak running through it. I have often seen Lucy when she brushes it out
at night. But because there is a dash of white in the front as if a powder puff had rested
there a moment by accident, it is screwed into a little knob and covered with skilfully made
yet perfectly apparent frontlets to represent the different styles of hair-dressing affected
by women of abundant locks.

No. 1, worn at breakfast, is the most reasonable. It is quite plain, slightly waved, and has
a few stray hairs carelessly curved where it joins the forehead. No. 2 is for rainy weather;
the curls are fuzzy and evidently baked in; it requires a durable veil to keep it in countenance.
Evan calls it the "rasher of bacon front." No. 3 is for calling and all entertainments where
the bonnet stays on; it has a baby bang edge a trifle curled and a substantial cushion atop
to hold the hat pins; while No. 4, the one she wore on our arrival, is an elaborate evening
toupie with a pompadour rolling over on itself and drooping slightly over one eye while it
melts into a butterfly bow and handful of puffs on the crown that in turn end in a single curl
behind.

We had a dainty little dinner, grape fruit, clear soup, smelts, wild duck, salad, fruit, and
coffee, and it was daintily served, for Miss Lavinia always keeps a good cook and remembers
our dislike of the various forms of hash known as entrées.

The coffee was placed on a low mahogany stand by the library fire, and Miss Lavinia herself
handed Evan a quaint little silver lamp by which to light his cigar, for she has all the cosmopolitan
instincts of a woman who not only knows the world but had heard her father discuss tobacco,
and really enjoyed the soothing fragrance of a good cigar.

As soon as we were settled and poor singed Josephus had tiptoed in by the fire, evidently trying
to make up for his shabby coat by the profundity of his purr, Evan set forth his scheme to
our hostess. We were to lodge and breakfast with her, but after that she was to play our way,
and be at our disposal morning, afternoon, and evening, at luncheon, dinner, and supper, and
the game was to be the old-fashioned one of "follow the leader!"

At first Miss Lavinia hesitated regretfully, it seemed so inhospitable,--she had thought to
take us to several parlour concerts. Mrs. Vanderdonk, she that was a De Leyster, was going
to throw open her picture gallery for charity, which would give us an opportunity to see her
new house. In fact the undertow of the Whirlpool was still pulling at her ankles, even though
she had freed her head, and it seemed impossible to her that there could be any New York other
than the one she knew.

Finally her almost girlish vitality asserted itself, and bargaining that we should allow her
one evening to have Sylvia Latham to dinner, she surrendered.

"Then we will begin at once by going to the theatre," said Evan, jumping up and looking at
the clock, which pointed at a few minutes of eight.

"Have you tickets? Isn't this a little sudden?" asked Miss Lavinia with a little gasp, evidently
remembering that her hair was arranged for the house only.

"No, I have no tickets, but Barbara and I always go in this way, and if we cannot get in at
one place we try another, for usually some good seats are returned from the outside ticket
offices a few minutes before the play begins. The downtown theatres open the earliest, so we
can start near by and work our way upward, if necessary."

To my surprise in five minutes Miss Lavinia was ready, and we sallied forth, Evan sandwiched
between us. As the old Dorman house is in the northeastern corner of what was far away Greenwich
Village,--at the time-the Bouerie was a blooming orchard, and is meshed in by a curious jumble
of thoroughfares, that must have originally either followed the tracks of wandering cattle
or worthy citizens who had lost their bearings, for Waverley Place comes to an untimely end
in West Eleventh Street, and Fourth Street collides with Horatio and is headed off by Thirteenth
Street before it has a chance even to catch a glimpse of the river,--a few steps brought us
into Fourteenth Street, where naming gas-jets announced that the play of "Jim Bludso" might
be seen.

"Dear me!" ejaculated Miss Lavinia, "do people still go to this theatre? The last time I came
here it was in the seventies to see Mrs. Rousby as Rosalind."

When we took our seats the play, founded, as the bill informed us, upon one of the Pike County
Ballads, had begun, and Miss Lavinia soon became absorbed.

It is a great deal to be surrounded by an audience all thoroughly in the mood to be swayed
by the emotion of the piece, plain people, perhaps, but solidly honest. Directly in front sat
a young couple; the girl, in a fresh white silk waist, wore so fat and new a wedding ring upon
her ungloved hand, which the man held in a tight grip, that I surmised that this trip into
stageland was perhaps their humble wedding journey, from which they would return to "rooms"
made ready by jubilant relatives, eat a wonderful supper, and begin life.

The next couple were not so entirely en rapport. The girl, who wore a gorgeous garnet engagement
ring, also very new, merely rested her hand on her lover's coat sleeve where she could see
the light play upon the stones.

When, after the first act, in answer to hearty rounds of applause, varied with whistles and
shouts from the gallery, the characters stepped forward, not in the unnatural string usual
in more genteel play-houses, where victor and vanquished join hands and bow, but one by one,
each being greeted by cheers, hisses, or groans, according to the part, and when the villain
appeared I found myself groaning with the rest, and though Evan laughed, I know he understood.

After it was over, as we went out into the night, Evan headed toward Sixth Avenue instead of
homeward.

"May I ask where we are going now?" said Miss Lavinia, meekly. She had really enjoyed the play,
and I know I heard her sniff once or twice at the proper time, though of course I pretended not to.

"Going?" echoed Evan. "Only around the corner to get three fries in a box, with the usual pickle
and cracker trimmings, there being no restaurant close by that you would care for; then we
will carry them home and have a little supper in the pantry, if your Lucy has not locked up
the forks and taken the key to bed. If she has, we can use wooden toothpicks."

At first Miss Lavinia seemed to feel guilty at the idea of disturbing Lucy's immaculate pantry
at such an hour; but liberty is highly infectious. She had spent the evening out without previous
intent; the next step was to feel that her soul was her own on her return. She unlocked the
forks, Evan unpacked the upstairs ice-chest for the dog's head bass that wise women always
have when they expect visiting Englishmen, even though they are transplanted and acclimated
ones, and she ate the oysters, still steaming from their original package, with great satisfaction.
After we had finished Miss Lavinia bravely declared her independence of Lucy. The happy don't-care
feeling produced by broiled oysters and bass on a cold night is a perfect revelation to people
used to after-theatre suppers composed of complications, sticky sweets, and champagne.

When we had finished I thought for a moment that she showed a desire to conceal the invasion
by washing the dishes, but she put it aside, and we all went upstairs together.

A little shopping being in order, Evan took himself off in the morning, leaving Miss Lavinia
and me to prowl, after we had promised to meet him at a downtown restaurant at one.

Little boys are delightful things to shop for,--there is no matching this and that, no getting
a yard too much or too little, everything is substantial and straight away, and all you have
to do when the bundles are sent home by express is to strengthen the sewing on of buttons and
reinforce the seats and knees of everyday pantikins from the inside.

We strolled about slowly, and at half past one were quite ready to sit still and not only eat
our lunch but watch business mankind eat his. If any one wishes to feel the clutch and motive
power of the Whirlpool let him go to the Mazarin any time between twelve-thirty and two o'clock.
The streets themselves are surging with men, all hurrying first in one direction, then another,
until it seems as if there either must be a fire somewhere, or else a riot afoot. The doors
of the restaurant open and shut incessantly, corks pop, knives and forks rattle, everything
is being served from a sandwich and a glass of beer to an elaborate repast with a wine to every
course, while through and above it all the stress of business is felt. Of course the great
financiers usually have luncheon served in their offices, to save them from the crowd; besides,
it might give common humanity a chance to scrutinize their countenances, and perchance read
what they thought upon some question of moment, for it sometimes seems as if the eye of the
New York journalist has X-ray power. On the other hand, the humbler grade, with less of either
time or money to spare, go to the "quick lunch" counters and "dime-in-the-slot" sandwich concerns;
yet Evan says that the gathering at the Mazarin is fairly representative.

Miss Lavinia was bewildered. Her downtown visits to her broker's office were always made in
a cab, with Lucy to stay in it as a preventative of the driver's taking a sly glass or a thief
snatching her lap-robe--she never uses public carriage rugs. She clung to the obsolete idea
that Wall Street was no place for women, and saw, as in a dream, the daintily dressed stenographers,
bookkeepers, and confidential clerks mingling with the trousered ranks in the street, not to
mention the damsels in tidy shirtwaists, with carefully undulated hair and pointed, polished
finger nails, who were lunching at near-by tables, sometimes seemingly with their employers
as well as with other male or female friends.

"I wonder how much of all this is bad for uptown home life?" Miss Lavinia queried, gazing around
the room; but as she did not address either of us in particular, we did not answer, as we did
not know,--who does?

A spare half-hour before closing time we gave to the Stock Exchange, and it was quite enough,
for some one was short on something, and pandemonium reigned. As we stood on the corner of
Rector Street and Broadway, hesitating whether to take surface or elevated cars, faint strains
of organ music from Trinity attracted us.

"Service or choir practice; let us go in a few moments," said Evan, to whom the organ is a
voice that never fails to draw.  We took seats far back, and lost ourselves among the shadows.
A special service was in progress, the music half Gregorian, and the congregation was too scattered
to mar the feeling that we had slipped suddenly out of the material world. The shadows of the
sparrows outside flitted upward on the stained glass windows, until it seemed as if the great
chords had broken free and taking form were trying to escape.

Now and then the door would open softly and unaccustomed figures slip in and linger in the
open space behind the pews. Aliens, newly landed and wandering about in the vicinity of their
water-front lodging-houses, music and a church appealed to their loneliness. Some stood, heads
bowed, and some knelt in prayer and crossed themselves on leaving; one woman, lugging a great
bundle tied in a blue cloth, a baby on her arm and another clinging to her skirts, put down
her load, bedded the baby upon it, and began to tell her beads.

The service ended, and the people scattered, but the organist played on, and the boy choir
regathered, but less formally.

"What is it?" we asked of the verger, who was preparing to close the doors.

"There will be a funeral of one of the oldest members of the congregation to-morrow, and they
are about to go through the music of the office."

Suddenly a rich bass voice, strong in conviction, trumpeted forth--"I am the resurrection and
the life!" And only a stone's throw away jingled the money market of the western world. The
temple and the table of the money changers keep step as of old. Ah, wonderful New York!

       *       *       *       *       *

The afternoon was clear staccato and mild withal, and the sun, almost at setting, lingered
above orange and dim cloud banks at the end of the vista Broadway made.

"Are you tired? Can you walk half a dozen blocks?" asked Evan of Miss Lavinia, as we came out.

"No, quite the reverse; I think that I am electrified," she replied briskly.

"Then we will go to Battery Park," he said, turning south.

"Battery Park, where all the immigrants and roughs congregate! What an idea! We shall catch
smallpox or have our pockets picked!"

"Have you ever been there?" persisted Evan.

"Yes, once, I think, when steamship passengers lathed at the barge office, and of course I've
seen it often in going to Staten Island to visit Cousin Lucretia."

Evan's only reply was to keep on walking. We did not cross the "bowling green," but swung to
the right toward Pier I, and took the path between old Castle Garden and the sea wall at the
point where one of the fire patrol boats was resting, steam up and hose nozzles pointed, lance
couchant wise.

Ah, what a picture! No wonder Miss Lavinia adjusted her glasses quickly (she is blindly nearsighted),
caught her breath, and clung to Evan's arm as the fresh sea breeze coming up from the Narrows
wheeled her about. Before us Staten Island divided the water left and right, while between
it and the Long Island shore, just leaving quarantine and dwarfing the smaller craft, an ocean
liner, glistening with ice, was coming on in majestic haste. All about little tugs puffed and
snorted, and freighters passed crosswise, parting the floating ice and churning it with their
paddles, scarcely disturbing the gulls, that flew so close above the water that their wings
touched, or floated at leisure.

The sun that had been gilding everything from masthead to floating spar gathered in its forces,
and for one moment seemed to rest upon Liberty's torch, throwing the statue into clear relief,
and then dropped rapidly behind the river's night-cloud bank, and presently lights began to
glimmer far and near, the night breath rose from the water, and the wave-cradled gulls slept.

"Do you like our New York?" asked Evan, turning to go.

"Don't speak," whispered Miss Lavinia, hanging back.

But we were no sooner on the elevated train than she found use for her tongue, for whose feet
should I stumble over on entering, quite big feet too, or rather shoes, for the size of the
man, but Martin Cortright's, and of course he was duly presented to Miss Lavinia.

V

FEBRUARY VIOLETS

That night Miss Lavinia was forced to ask "for time for 'forty winks'" before she could even
think of dinner, and Evan and I sat them out in the deep, hospitable chairs by the library
fire. We were not tired, simply held in check; country vitality shut off from certain ways
for six months is not quickly exhausted, but, on the other hand, when it is spent, it takes
several months to recuperate.

The first night that I leave home for these little excursions I have a sense of virtue and
simmering self-congratulation. I feel that I am doing a sensible thing in making a break from
what the theorists call "the narrowing evenness of domestic existence." Of course it is a good
thing for me to leave father and the boys, and see and hear something new to take back report
of to them; it is better for them to be taught appreciation of me by absence; change is beneficial
to every one, etc., etc., and all that jargon.

The second night I am still true to the theory, but am convinced that to the highly imaginative,
a city day and its doings may appear like the Biblical idea of eternity--reversed--"a thousand
years."  The third night I am painfully sure of this, and if I remain away over a fourth, which
is very rare, I cast the whole theory out to the winds of scepticism, and am so restless and
disagreeable that Evan usually suggests that I take a morning train home and do not wait for
him, which is exactly the responsibility that I wish him to assume, thus saving me from absolute
surrender.

We always have a good time on our outings, and yet after each the pleasure of return grows
keener, so that occasionally Evan remonstrates and says: "Sometimes I cannot understand your
attitude; you appear to enjoy every moment keenly, and yet when you go home you act as if you
had mercifully escaped from a prison that necessitated going through a sort of thanksgiving
ceremony. It seems very irrational."

But when I ask him if it would be more rational to be sorry to come home, he does not answer,--at
least not in words.

"Where do we dine to-night?" I asked Evan, as he was giving unmistakable signs of "meditation,"
and I heard by the footsteps overhead that Miss Lavinia was stirring.

"At the Art and Nature Club. You can dress as much or as little as you please, and we can get
a table in a cosey corner, and afterward sit about upstairs for an hour, for there will be
music to-night. I have asked Martin Cortright to join us. It has its interesting side, this--a
transplanted Englishman married to a country girl introducing old bred-in-the-bone New Yorkers
to New Manhattan."

When I go to town my costuming consists merely in change of waists, as street and public conveyances
alike are a perpetual menace to one's best petticoats, so in a few moments we were on our way
uptown.

We did not tell Miss Lavinia where we were going until we were almost there, and she was quite
upset, as dining at the two or three hotels and other places affected by the Whirlpoolers implies
a careful and special toilet to run the gantlet of society reporters, for every one is somebody
in one sense, though in another "nobody is really any one."

She was reassured, however, the moment that she drew her high-backed oak chair up to the table
that Evan had reserved in a little alcove near the fireplace. Before the oysters arrived, and
Martin Cortright appeared to fill the fourth seat, she had completely relaxed, and was beaming
at the brass jugs and pottery beakers ranged along a shelf above the dark wainscot, and at
the general company, while the warmth from the fire logs gave her really a very pretty colour,
and she began to question Martin as to who all these people, indicating the rapidly filling-up
tables, were. But Martin gazed serenely about and confessed he did not know.

The people came singly, or in twos and threes, men and women together or alone, a fact at which
Miss Lavinia greatly marvelled. Greetings were exchanged, and there was much visiting from
table to table, as if the footing was that of a private house.

"Nice-looking people," said Miss Lavinia, meditatively scrutinizing the room through her lorgnette
without a trace of snobbery in her voice or attitude, yet I was aware that she was mentally
drawing herself apart. "Some of them quite unusual, but there is not a face here that I ever
saw in society. Are they members of the Club? Where do they come from? Where do they live?"

Evan's lips shut together a moment before he answered, and I saw a certain steely gleam in
his eye that I always regarded as a danger signal.

"Perhaps they might ask the same questions about you," he answered; "though they are not likely
to, their world is so much broader. They are men and women chiefly having an inspiration, an
art or craft, or some vital reason for living besides the mere fact that it has become a habit.
They are none of them rich enough to be disagreeable or feel that they own the right to trample
on their fellows. They all live either in or near New York, as best suits their means, vocations,
and temperaments. Men and women together, they represent, as well as a gathering can, the hopeful
spirit of our New York of New Manhattan that does not grovel to mere money power."

Miss Lavinia seemed a little abashed, but Martin Cortright, who had been a silent observer
until now, said: "It surprises me to see fraternity of this sort in the midst of so many institutions
of specialized exclusiveness and the decadence of clubs, that used to be veritable brotherhoods,
by unwise expansion. I like the general atmosphere, it seems cheerful and, if one may blend
the terms, conservatively Bohemian."

"Come upstairs before the music begins, so that we can get comfortably settled in the background,
that I may tell you who some of these 'unknown-to-Whirlpool-society' people are. You may be
surprised," said Evan to Miss Lavinia, who had by this time finished her coffee.

The rooms were cheerful with artistic simplicity. The piano had been moved from the lounging
room into the picture gallery opposite to where a fine stained glass window was exhibited,
backed by electric lights.

We stowed ourselves away in a deep seat, shaped something like an old-fashioned school form,
backed and cushioned with leather, to watch the audience gather. Every phase of dress was present,
from the ball gown to the rainy weather skirt, and enough of each grade to keep one another
in countenance. About half the men wore evening suits, but those who did not were completely
at their ease.

There was no regular ushering to seats, but every one was placed easily and naturally. Evan,
who had Miss Lavinia in charge, was alert, and rather, it seemed to me, on the defensive; but
though Martin asked questions, he was comfortably soothing, and seemed to take in much at a glance.

That short man with the fine head, white hair and beard, aquiline nose, and intense eyes is
not only a poet, but the first American critic of pure literature. He lives out of town, but
comes to the city daily for a certain stimulus. The petite woman with the pretty colour who
has crossed the room to speak to him is the best known writer of New England romance. That
shy-looking fellow standing against the curtain at your right, with the brown mustache and
broad forehead, is the New England sculptor whose forcible creations are known everywhere,
yet he is almost shrinkingly modest, and he never, it seems, even in thought, has broken the
injunction of "Let another praise thee, not thine own lips."

Half a dozen promising painters are standing in the doorway talking to a young woman who, beginning
with newspaper work, has stepped suddenly into a niche of fiction. The tall, loose-jointed
man at the left of the group, the editor of a conservative monthly, has for his vis-à-vis the
artist who has had so much to do with the redemption of American architecture and decoration
from the mongrel period of the middle century. Another night you may not see a single one of
these faces, but another set, yet equally interesting.

Meanwhile Martin Cortright had discovered a man, a financier and also a book collector of prominence,
who was reputed to have a complete set of some early records that he had long wished to consult;
he had never found a suitable time for meeting him, as the man, owing to having been oftentime
the prey of both unscrupulous dealers and parasitic friends, was esteemed difficult.

Infected by the freedom of his surroundings, Martin plucked up courage and spoke to him, the
result being an interchange of cards, book talk, and an invitation to visit the library.

Then the music began, and lasted not above an hour, with breathing and chatting intervals,
followed by claret cup and lemonade. A pleasant evening's recreation, with no opportunity of
accumulating the material for either mental or physical headache.

The night air was very soft, but of that delusive quality that in February portends snow, and
not the return of bluebirds, as the uninitiated might expect. Miss Lavinia was fascinated by
the lights and motion of Herald Square, and at her suggestion, it being but a little past ten,
we strolled homeward down Broadway instead of taking a car. Her delight at the crowd of promenaders,
the picturesque florists' shops, and the general buzz of night life was almost pathetic. Her
after-dark experience having been to get to and from specified places as quickly as possible
with Lucy for escort, solicitous when in a street car lest they should pass their destination,
and trembling even more when in a cab lest the driver should have committed the variable and
expansive crime of "taking something." She bought a "ten o'clock edition" of the Telegram,
some of "Match Mary's" wares, that perennially middle-aged woman who haunts the theatre region,
and suggested that we have ice-cream soda at a particularly glittering drug store, but this
desire was switched into hot bouillon by Evan, who retains the Englishman's dislike of chilling
his internals.

New York is really a fine city by night, that is, in parts at least, and yet it is very strange
how comparatively few of the rank and file of its inhabitants walk abroad to see the spectacle.

By lamplight the scars and wounds of subways appear less vivid, and the perpetual skeleton
of the skyscraper merges in its background. The occasional good bit of architecture steps out
boldly from the surrounding shadows of daylight discouragement. City life does not seem to
be such an exhausting struggle, and even the "misery wagons," as I always call ambulances to
myself, look less dreary with the blinking light fore and aft, for you cannot go far in New
York without feeling the pitying thrill of their gongs.

After the brightness of Broadway the side streets seemed cavernous. As we turned westward and
crossed Sixth Avenue a dark figure, outlined full length against the blazing window of a corner
liquor saloon, lined with mirrors, in some way fixed my attention. It was a woman's figure,
slight, and a little crouching. The hat was gay and set on puffy hair, the jacket brave with
lace, but the skirt was frayed where it lapped the pavement, and the boot that was pushed from
beneath it, as if to steady a swaying frame, was thin and broken. I do not know why I looked
back after I had passed, but as I did so, I saw the girl, for she was little more, pull a scrap
of chamois from a little bag she carried and quickly rub rouge upon her hollow cheeks, using
the saloon mirror for a toilet glass. But when I saw the face itself I stopped short, giving
Evan's arm such a tug that he also turned.

The woman was Jennie, the Oakland baker's only daughter, who had no lack of country beaus,
but was flattered by the attentions of one of the Jenks-Smith's butlers, whose irreproachable
manners of the count-in-disguise variety made the native youths appear indeed uncouth. She
grew discontented, thought it beneath her social position to help her mother in the shop, and
went to town to work in a store, it was said until her wedding, which was to be that autumn.
Father worried over her and tried to advise, but to no purpose. This was more than two years
ago. The butler left the Jenks-Smith's, and we heard that he was a married man, with a family
who had come to look him up.

Jennie's mother said she had a fine place in a store, and showed us, from time to time, presents
the girl had sent her, so thus to find the truth was a shock indeed. Not but what all women
who are grown must bear upon them the weight of the general knowledge of evil, but it is none
the less awful to come face to face on a street corner with one who was the pretty village
girl, whom you last saw standing behind the neat counter with a pitcher of honeysuckles at
her elbow as she filled a bag with sugar cookies for your clamouring babies.

       *       *       *       *       *

I suppose that I must have exclaimed aloud, for Jennie started back and saw us, then dropped
her bag and began to grope about for it as if she was in a dream.

"Can't we do something?" I whispered to Evan, but he only gravely shook his head.

"Give her this for the boys' sake," I begged, fumbling in his change pocket and finding a bill
there. "Tell her it's home money from the Doctor's daughter--and--to go home--or--buy--a--pair
of shoes."

At first I thought she was not going to take it; but having found her bag she straightened
herself a moment, and without looking at Evan gave me a glance, half defiant, half beseeching,
grasped the money almost fiercely, and scuttled away in the darkness, and I found that I was
crying. But Evan understood,--he always does,--and I hope that if the boys read this little
book fifteen or twenty years hence, that they will also.

As we reached the door the first snowflakes fell. Poor Jennie!

       *       *       *       *       *

The third day of our stay began in country quiet. In fact we did not wake up until eight; everything
was snowbound, and even the occasional horse cars that pass the front of the house had ceased
their primitive tinkling. The milkman did not come, neither did the long crispy French rolls,
a New York breakfast institution for which the commuters confessedly have no substitute, and
it was after nine before breakfast was served.

Evan, who had disappeared, returned at the right moment with his newspaper and two bulky tissue
paper bundles all powdered with snow, one of which he gave to Miss Lavinia, the other to me.
I knew their contents the moment I set eyes on them, and yet it was none the less a heart-warming
surprise.

Down in a near-by market is a little florist's shop, so small that one might pass twenty times
without noticing it; the man, a local authority, who has kept it for years, makes a specialty
of the great long-stemmed single violets, whose fleeting fragrance no words may express. They
call them Californias now, but they are evidently the opulent kin of those sturdy, dark-eyed
Russian violets of my mother's garden, and as they mean more than any other flower to me, Evan
always brings them to me when I come to town. This morning he trudged out in the snow, hardly
thinking this man would have any, but by mere chance the grower, suspecting snow, brought in
his crop the night before, and in spite of the storm I had the first morning breath of these
flowers of a day.

Miss Lavinia sniffed and sighed, and then buried her aristocratic, but rather chilly, nose
in the mass. "I feel like a young girl with her first bouquet," she said presently.

"Ah, how good it is to be given something with a meaning. Most people think that to be able
to buy what they wish, within reason, is perfect happiness, but it isn't. Barbara, you and
this man of yours quite unsettle me and shake my pet theories. You show sides of things in
my own birthplace that I never dreamed of looking up, and you convince me, when I am on the
wane, that married friendship is the only thing worth living for. It's too bad of you, but
fortunately for me the notion passes off after you have gone away," and Miss Lavinia, after
loving her violets a bit longer, put them in a chubby jug of richly chased old silver.  After
breakfast we tried to coax her to bundle up and come with us to Washington Square to see the
crystal trees in all their beauty; but that was too unorthodox a feat. To plough through snow
in rubber boots in the very heart of the city was entirely too radical a move. She knew people
about the square, and I suppose did not wish to be seen by them, so she was obliged to content
herself with sight of the snow draperies and ice jewels that decked the trees and shrubs of
the doomed back yard.

Even though the storm called a halt in our plans for Miss Lavinia, Evan and I had a little
errand of our own, our annual pilgrimage to see the auction room where we first met that February
afternoon. The room is not there now, to be sure, but we go to see it all the same, and have
our little thrill and buy something near the place to take home to the boys, and we shall continue
to come each year unless public improvement causes the thoroughfare itself to be hung up in
the sky, which is quite possible.

Then Evan went down town, and I returned to lunch with Miss Lavinia, for, if possible, we were
to call on Sylvia Latham and ask her to dinner on the morrow, the last day of our stay. Miss
Lavinia proposed to invite Sylvia to spend the night also, that we might become acquainted
upon a basis less formal than a mere dinner.

Shortly after three o'clock we started in a coupé with two stout horses driven by a man above
suspicion of having "taken anything," at least at the start. It is a curious fact that eight
or ten inches of damp snow can so nearly paralyze the transportation facilities of a city like
New York, but such is the case. The elevated rails become slippery, the wheels will not grip,
and the entire wheel traffic of the streets betakes itself to the tracks of the surface lines,
where trolley, truck, and private carriage all move along solemnly in a strange procession,
like a funeral I once saw outside of Paris, where the hearse was followed by two finely draped
carriages, then by the business wagon of the deceased, filled with employees, the draperies
on this arranged so as not to disturb the sign,--he kept a pâtisserie,--while a donkey cart,
belonging to the market garden that supplied the deceased with vegetables, brought up the rear.

In the middle and lower parts of New York the streets and their life dominate the houses; on
the east side of the park the houses dominate the streets, and the flunkies, whose duty it
is either to let you in or preferably to keep you out of these houses, control the entire situation.
I may in the course of time come to respect or even like some of these mariners of the Whirlpool,
but as a class their servants are wholly and unendurably objectionable, and the sum of all
that is most aggravating.

The house faced the park. A carpet was spread down the steps, but we could not conjecture if
it was an ordinary custom in bad weather, or if some function was afoot. Evidently the latter,
as I had barely touched the bell when the door flew open. Two liveried attendants were within,
one turned the door knob and the other presented his tray for the cards, while in the distance
a third, wearing the dress of a butler or majordomo, stood by closed portières.

We had asked for Mrs. and Miss Latham, and evidently the combination caused confusion. No.
1 remained by the front door, No. 2, after a moment's hesitation, motioned us to seats near
the fireplace in the great reception hall, a room by itself, wainscoted with carved oak, that
also formed the banisters and the railing of a sort of balcony above, while the walls were
hung with rich-hued tapestries, whose colours were revealed by quaint shield-shaped electroliers
of gilded glass. Man No. 3 disappeared within the portières bearing our cards. In a moment
he reappeared, drew them apart, and stood aside as his mistress swept out, the same cold blond
woman I had seen in the market, but now most exquisitely clad in a pale gray gown of crêpe
embroidered with silver fern fronds and held at the neck by a deep collar of splendid pearls,
pearl rings alone upon her hands, in her hair a spray of silver mistletoe with pearls for berries.
She made an exquisite picture as she advanced swiftly to meet us, a half smile on her lips
and one pink-tipped hand extended. I love to look at beautiful women, yet the sight of her
gave me a sort of Undine shiver.

"Dear Miss Dorman, so glad to see you, and Mrs. Evan of Oaklands also. I have seen, but never
met you, I believe," she said, giving us her hand in turn. "I must ask you to the library,
(Perkins, Miss Sylvia," she said in an aside to No. 2, who immediately vanished upstairs,)
"and then excuse myself regretfully, for this is my afternoon for 'bridge,' as Monty Bell and
a friend or two of his are good enough to promise to come and give us hints. Monty is so useful,
you know, and so good-natured. I think you knew his mother, didn't you, Miss Lavinia? No, Sylvia
is not to play; she is not up enough for 'bridge.' I wish you could persuade her to take lessons
and an interest in the game, for when Lent begins she will be horribly bored, for there will
be a game somewhere every day, and sometimes two and three, and she will be quite out of it,
which is very ill-advised for a girl in her first winter, and especially when she starts as
late as Sylvia. I'm afraid that I shall have to take her south to wake her up, and that is
not in my schedule this season, I've so much to oversee at my Oaklands cottage.

"It is a very cold afternoon for you to have come so far, dear Miss Lavinia; a cup of tea or
something? No? Ah, here comes Sylvia, and I know you will forgive me for going," and Mrs. Latham
glided away with a glance toward the stairs. She evidently was in a desperate hurry to return
to her guests, and yet she spoke slowly, with that delightful southern deliberation that suits
women with pretty mouths so well, and still as I felt her eyes upon me I knew that to move
her in any way against her own will would be impossible, and that she could never love anything
but herself, and never would.

I did not look at Miss Lavinia in the brief moment before Sylvia entered, for we were both
too well bred to criticise a woman in her own house, even with our eyes, which had they met
would have been inevitable.

At first Sylvia only saw Miss Lavinia, and gathered her into her arms spontaneously, as if
she were the elder, as she was by far the bigger of the two. Then seeing me, the cards not
having been sent up, she hesitated a moment, colouring shyly, as a girl of sixteen might, and
then straightway greeted me without embarrassment. As we laid aside our wraps and seated ourselves
in a sort of cosey corner nook deep with pillows, and fur rugs nestling about the feet, I drew
my first comfortable breath since entering, and as Miss Lavinia naturally took the lead in
the conversation, giving her invitation for the next night, I had ample time to study Sylvia.
She was fine looking rather than handsome, a warm brunette with copper glints threading her
brown hair, thick curved lashes, big brown eyes, a good straight nose, and a decidedly humorous,
but not small mouth, with lips that curled back from even teeth, while her whole face was punctuated
and made winningly feminine by a deep dimple in the chin and a couple of vagrant ones that
played about her mouth corners when she spoke, as she always did, looking directly at one.

Her hands were long and well shaped, not small, but competent looking, a great contrast to
her mother's, as well as to Miss Lavinia's, that could slip easily into a five-and-a-half glove.
She wore a graceful afternoon gown of pale blue with lace butterflies on the blouse and skirt,
held in at waist and neck by enamelled butterfly buckles. She moved gracefully, and had a strong
individuality, a warmth of nature that contrasted keenly with the statuesque perfection of
her mother, and I fell to wondering what her father was like, and if she resembled him.

"Not yet, not until late spring," I heard her say in answer to Miss Lavinia's question as to
whether her father had returned from his Japan tour.

"He is detained by railway business in San Francisco, and cannot go farther north to settle
it until winter breaks. I've written him to ask leave to join him and perhaps stop awhile at
Los Angeles and go up to see my brother on his Wyoming ranch in May. I do so hope he will let
me. I've tried to coax mamma to go too, she has had such a wearing life this winter in trying
to make it pleasant for me and introduce me to her friends. I wish I could tell her exactly
how much I should prefer to be more alone with her. I do not want her to think me ungrateful,
but to go out with her to father and pay dear old Carthy a visit would be simply splendid."

Then turning to me she said, I thought with a little quiver in her voice, "They tell me you
live with your father, Mrs. Evan--even though you are married, and I have not seen mine for
more than two years, only think of it!"

Whereat my heart went out to her, and I prayed mentally that her father might have a broad
warm shoulder to pillow her head and a ready ear to hear her confidences, for the perfectly
rounded neck and shell ear of the mother playing cards in the next room would never give harbour
or heed, I knew.

Sylvia was as pleased as a child at the idea of coming down to spend the night, stipulating
that if it was still cold she should be allowed to make taffy and put it on the shed to harden,
saying, with a pout: "At school and college there was always somewhere that I could mess with
sticky things and cook, but here it is impossible, though mamma says I shall have an outdoor
tea-room at the Oaklands all to myself, and give chafing-dish parties, for they are quite the
thing. 'The thing' is my boogy man, I'm afraid. If what you wish to do, no matter how silly,
agrees with it, it's all right, but if it doesn't, all the wisdom of Solomon won't prevail
against those two words."

Man No. 2 at this juncture came in and presented a florist's box and envelope in a tray, saying,
sotto voce, as he did so, "Shall I hopen it and arrange them, miss, or will you wear them?"
for, as the result of lavish entertaining and many hothouses as well as friends, flowers showered
upon the Latham house at all hours, and both library and hall were almost too fragrant.  Sylvia
glanced at the note, saying, "I will wear them," to the man, handed the card to Miss Lavinia,
her face flushing with pleasure, while No. 2 extracted a modest bunch of California violets
from the paper, handed them to his young mistress, and retired with the box on his tray.

The name on the card was Horace Bradford, the pencilled address University Club, on the reverse
were the words, "May I give myself the pleasure of calling to-morrow night? These February
violets are in remembrance of a May ducking. Am in town for two days only on college business."

"The day that he rowed us on the Avon and reached too far up the bank to pick you wild violets
and the boat shot ahead and he fell into the water," laughed Miss Lavinia, as pleased as Sylvia
at the recollection.

"But I am going to you to-morrow evening," said Sylvia, ruefully at thought of missing a friend,
but quite heart-free, as Miss Lavinia saw.

"Let me take the card, and I will ask him to dinner also," said the dear, comfortable, prim
soul, who was still bubbling over with love of youth, "and Barbara shall ask her adopted uncle
Cortright to keep the number even."

Time, it seems, had flown rapidly. She had barely slipped the card in her case when the door
opened and No. 3 approached solemnly and whispered, "Mrs. Latham requests, Miss, as how you
will come and pour tea, likewise bringing the ladies, if still here!" How those words still
here smote the silence.

We immediately huddled on our wraps, anxious to be gone and spare Sylvia possible embarrassment,
in spite of her protestations. As No. 2 led the way to the door a gentleman crossed the hall
from the card-room and greeted Sylvia with easy familiarity. He was about forty, a rather colourless
blonde, with clean shaven face of the type so commonly seen now that it might belong equally
either to footman or master. His eyes had a slantwise expression, but his dress was immaculate.

Strolling carelessly by the girl's side I heard him say, "I came to see if you needed coaxing;
some of the ladies are green over their losses, so have a care for your eyes." Then he laughed
at the wide-eyed look of wonder she gave him as he begged a violet for his coat.

But Sylvia drew herself up, full an inch above him, and replied, decidedly, but with perfect
good nature, "No, those violets are a message from Shakespeare,--one does not give such away."

"That is Monty Bell," said Miss Lavinia, tragically, as soon as the door closed.

"Is there anything the matter with him except that his colouring is like a summer squash?" I asked.

"He's been divorced by his wife, and it was her mother that was my friend, not his, as Mrs.
Latham hinted. I know the story; it makes me shiver to see him near Sylvia." Then Miss Lavinia
drew into a shell, in which she remained until we reached home.

Meanwhile, as we drove in silence, I remembered that Richard's rubber boots leaked, and I wondered
if Martha Corkle would discover it, or if he was paddling about getting his feet wet and bringing
on a sore throat. But when I got home Evan said he had sent the boots to the bicycle tire mender's
the morning I came away. It was the third night of my stay, and he would not have known what
to make of it if I had not raised some sort of a ghost.

       *       *       *       *       *

The sidewalks being clear, we dined at the Laurent, giving Miss Lavinia a resurrection of French
cooking, manners, women, ogling, ventilation, wine, and music. Then we took her, on the way
home, to see some horrible wax figures, listen to a good Hungarian band, and nearly put her
eyes out with a cinematograph show of the Coronation and Indian Durbar. Finishing up by brewing
French chocolate in the pantry and stirring it with stick bread, and our guest, in her own
house, went to bed fairly giggling in Gallic gayety, declaring that she felt as if she had
spent the evening on the Paris boulevards, that she liked our New York, and felt ten years younger.

VI

ENTER A MAN

If I weather my fourth day in town I am apt to grow a trifle waspish, even though I may not
be goaded to the stinging point. This is especially the case if, as on this recent visit, I
am obliged to do any shopping for myself. Personally, I prefer the rapid transit shopping of
ordering by mail, it avoids so many complications. Having made up your mind what you need,
or perhaps, to speak more truthfully, what you want, for one can hardly be quite content with
mere necessities until one grows either so old or shapeless that everything is equally unbecoming,
samples are forthcoming, from which an intelligent selection can be made without the demoralizing
effect of glib salespeople upon one's judgment.

I know my own shortcomings by heart, and I should never have deliberately walked into temptation
yesterday morning if Lavinia Dorman had not said that she wished my advice. Last year I went
with the intention of buying substantial blue serge for an outing gown, and was led astray
by some gayly flowered muslins. I have a weakness for gay colours, especially red. These when
made up Evan pronounced "extremely pretty--in the abstract"--which is his way of saying that
a thing is either unsuitable or very unbecoming. When I went to father, hoping for consolation,
he was even less charitable, remarking that he thought now long lines were more suitable and
graceful for me than bunches and bowknots. True, the boys admired the most thickly flowered
gown immensely for a few minutes, Richard bringing me a posy to match for my hair, while Ian
walked about me in silence which he broke suddenly with the trenchant remark--"Barbara, I think
your dwess would be prettier if it was weeded some!"

All of which is of course perfectly true. I have not been growing thinner all these six years,
but this morning, in stooping over one of the cold frames to see how the plants within had
weathered the storm, it came quite as a shock to me to feel that, like Martin Cortright, I
am getting stout and in the way of myself when I bend, like an impediment in a door hinge.

However, as Miss Lavinia desired guidance in buying some real country clothes, I felt it my
duty to give it. She is already making elaborate preparations for her visit to me. It seems
strange, that simplicity is apparently one of the most laborious things in the world to those
unaccustomed to it, yet so it is.

She is about to make her initial venture in shirtwaists, and she approaches them with as much
caution as if she were experimenting with tights and trunks. The poor little seamstress who
is officiating has, to my certain knowledge, tried one waist on five times, because, as Miss
Lavinia does not "feel it," she thinks it cannot fit properly.

Never mind, she will get over all that, of course. The plan that she has formed of spending
five or six months in the real country must appear somewhat in the light of a revolution to
her, and the preparation of a special uniform and munitions for the campaign a necessary precaution.
Her present plan is to come to me for May, then, if the life suits her, she will either take
a small house that one of our farmer neighbours often rents for the summer months, or else,
together with her maid, Lucy, board at one of the hill farms.

I have told her plainly (for what is friendship worth if one may not be frank) that if after
trial we agree with each other, I hope she will stay with us all the season; but as for her
maid, I myself will supply her place, if need be, and Effie do her mending, for I could not
have Lucy come.

Perhaps it may be very narrow and provincial, but to harbour other people's servants seems
to me like inviting contagion and subjecting one's kitchen to all the evils of boarding house
atmosphere.

I used to think last summer, when I saw the arrival of various men and maids belonging to guests
of the Bluff Colony, that I should feel much more at ease in the presence of royalty, and that
I could probably entertain Queen Alexandra at dinner with less shock to her nerves and traditions
than one of these ladies' maids or gentlemen's gentlemen.

Martha Corkle expresses her opinion freely upon this subject, and I must confess to being a
willing listener, for she does not gossip, she portrays, and often with a masterly touch. The
woes of her countrywoman, the Ponsonby's housekeeper, often stir her to the quick. The Ponsonby
household is perhaps one of the most "difficult" on the Bluffs, because its members are of
widely divergent ages. The three Ponsonby girls range from six to twenty-two, with a college
freshman son second from the beginning, while Josephine, sister of the head of the family,
though quite Miss Lavinia's age, is the gayest of the gay, and almost outdoes her good-naturedly
giddy sister-in-law.

"It's just hawful, Mrs. Evan," Martha said one day, when, judging by the contents of the station
'bus and baggage wagon, almost the entire Ponsonby house staff must have left at a swoop; "my
eyes fairly bleeds for poor Mrs. Maggs" (the housekeeper), "that they do. 'Twas bad enough
in the old country, where we knew our places, even though some was ambitioned to get out of
them; but here it's like blind man's buff, and enough to turn a body giddy. Mrs. Maggs hasn't
a sittin' room of her own where she and the butler and the nurse can have their tea in peace
or entertain guests, but she sets two tables in the servants' hall, and a pretty time she has
of it.

"The kitchen maid and the laundress's assistant wait on the first table; but one day when,
the maid of one of Miss Ponsonby's friends comin' down over late, she was served with instead
o' by them, she gave Mrs. Maggs the 'orriblest settin' down, as not knowin' her business in
puttin' a lady's lady with servants' servants, the same which Mrs. Maggs does know perfectly
(accidents bein' unpreventable), bein' child of Lord Peacock's steward and his head nurse,
and swallowin' it all in with her mother's milk, so to speak, not borrowin' it second hand
as some of the great folks on the Bluffs themselves do from their servants, not feelin' sure
of the kerrect thing, yet desirin' so to do. Mrs. Maggs, poor body, she has more mess with
that servants' hall first table than with all the big dinners the master gives.

"'Mrs. Corkle,' says she, bein' used to that name, besides Corkle bein' kin to her husband,
'what I sets before my own household, as it were, they leaves or they eats, it's one to me;
but company's got to be handled different, be it upstairs or down, for the name of the 'ouse,
but when Mr. Jollie, the French valet that comes here frequent with the master's partner, wants
dripped coffee and the fat scraped clean from his chop shank, else the flavour's spoiled for
him, and Bruce the mistress' brother's man wants boiled coffee, and thick fat left on his breakfast
ham, what stands between my poor 'ead and a h'assleyum? that's what I wants to know. Three
cooks I've had this very season, it really bein' the duty of the first kitchen maid to cook
for the servants' hall; but if a cook is suited to a kitchen maid, as is most important, she'll
stand by her. No, Martha Corkle, wages is 'igh, no doubt,--fortunes to what they were when
we were gells,--but not 'igh for the worry; and bein' in service ain't what it were.'"

Then I knew that Martha, even as her bosom heaves over her friend's grievances, was also sighing
with content at thought of Timothy Saunders and her own lot; and I recalled the Lady of the
Bluffs' passing remark, and felt that I am only beginning to realize the deliciousness of "comfortable
poverty."

       *       *       *       *       *

Miss Lavinia and I spent some time browsing among the shops, finally bringing up at an old
conservative dry goods concern in Broadway, the most satisfactory place to shop in New York,
because there is never a crowd, and the salesmen, many of them grown gray in the service, take
an Old World interest in their wares and in you.

While I was trying to convince Miss Lavinia as to the need of the serviceable, she was equally
determined to decoy me toward the frivolous; and I yielded, I may say fell, to the extent of
buying a white crêpey sort of pattern gown that had an open work white lilac pattern embroidered
on it. It certainly was very lovely, and it is nice to have a really good gown in reserve,
even if a plainer one that will stand hugging, sticky fingers, and dogs' damp noses is more
truly enjoyable.

N.B.--I must get over apologizing to myself when I buy respectable clothes. It savours too
much of Aunt Lot's old habit of saying, every time she bought a best gown, and I remonstrated
with her for the colour (it was always black in those days; since she's married the Reverend
Jabez she's taken to greens), "When I consider that a black dress would be suitable to be buried
in, it seems less like a vain luxury."

We were admiring the dainty muslins, but only in the "abstract," when I looked up, conscious
that some one was coming directly toward us, and saw Sylvia Latham crossing the shop from the
door, her rapid, swinging gait bringing her to us before short-sighted Miss Lavinia had a chance
to raise her lorgnette.

Sylvia was genuinely glad to see us, and she expressed it both by look and speech, without
the slightest symptom of gush, yet with the confiding manner of one who craves companionship.
I had, in fact, noticed the same thing during our call the afternoon before.

"Well, and what are we buying to-day?" asked Miss Lavinia, clearing her voice by a little caressing
sound halfway between a purr and a cluck, and patting the hand that lingered affectionately
on hers.

"I really--don't--know," answered Sylvia, smiling at her own hesitation. "Mamma says that if
I do not get my clothes together before people begin to come back from the South, I shall be
nowhere, so she took me with her to Mme. Couteaux's this morning. Mamma goes there because
she says it saves so much trouble. Madame keeps a list of every article her customers have,
and supplies everything, even down to under linen and hosiery, so she has made for mamma a
plan of exactly what she would need for next season, and after having received her permission,
will at once begin to carry it out. Of course the clothes will be very beautiful and harmonious,
and mamma has so much on her hands, now that father is away,--the new cottage at Oaklands is
being furnished, and me to initiate in the way I'm supposed to go,--that it certainly simplifies
matters for her.

"Me? Ah, I do not like the system at all, or Madame Couteaux either, and the feeling is mutual,
I assure you. Without waiting to be asked, even, she looked me over from head to foot and said
that my lines are very bad, that I curve in and out at the wrong places, that I must begin
at once by wearing higher heels to throw me forward!

"At first I was indignant, and then the ludicrous climbed uppermost, and I laughed, whereat
Madame looked positively shocked, and even mamma seemed aghast and murmured something apologetic
about my having been at boarding-school in the country, and at college, where I had ridden
horseback without proper instruction, which had injured my figure. Only imagine, Aunt Lavinia,
those glorious gallops among the Rockcliffe Hills hurting one's body in any way! But then,
I suppose body and figure are wholly different things; at any rate, Madame Couteaux gave a
shrug, as if shedding all responsibility for my future from her fat shoulders, and so, while
mamma is there, I am taking a run out in the cold world of raw material and observing for myself.

"Of course I shall make mistakes, but I have had everything done for me to such an extent,
during the last four months, that I really must make a point of picking and choosing for once.
I've had a mad desire since the last storm to stir up the pools in the gutters with my best
shoes, as the happy little children do with their rubber boots. How I shall enjoy it when we
go to Oaklands, and there is really something to do instead of merely being amused.

"By the way, Mrs. Evan, won't you and Miss Lavinia join us at luncheon? We are to have it somewhere
downtown, to-day,--the Waldorf, I believe,--as mamma expects to spend most of the afternoon
at the decorators, to see the designs for the Oaklands hangings and furniture, and," glancing
at the big clock, between the lifts, as Miss Lavinia made her last purchase, "it's high time
for me to go and pick her up."

Having a feeling that possibly mamma might not be so cordial, in addition to being due at home
for more shirtwaist fittings, Miss Lavinia declined, and reminding Sylvia that dinner would
be at the old-fashioned hour of half-past six, we drifted out the door together, Sylvia going
toward Fifth Avenue, while we turned the corner and sauntered down Broadway, pausing at every
attractive window.

Miss Lavinia's short-sightedness caused her to bump into a man, who was intently gazing, from
the height of six feet, at jewelled bugs, displayed in the window of a dealer in Oriental wares.

The man, thinking himself to blame, raised his hat in apology, glancing casually down as he
did so, whereupon the hat remained off, and he and Miss Lavinia grasped hands with sudden enthusiasm,
followed by a medley of questions and answers, so that before she remembered me, and turned
to introduce the stranger, I knew that it was Horace Bradford himself. A strange, but positive,
fact about New York is that one may at one time be in it but a few hours and run across half
the people of one's acquaintance, gathered from all parts of the country, and at another, wander
about for weeks without seeing a familiar face.

I liked Bradford from the moment I shook hands with him. There is so much in the mere touching
of hands. His neither crushed as if to compel, nor flopped equivocally, but said, as it enclosed
yours in its bigness, "I am here, command me."

Broadway, during shopping hours, is not an ideal place for the interchange of either ideas,
or more, even, than the merest courtesies; but after thanking Miss Lavinia for the dinner invitation,
to which he had just sent the answer, and inquiring for Sylvia Latham, as he walked beside
us for a block or two, it was very evident that he had something on his mind that he wished
to say, and did not know how to compass the matter.

As he talked to Miss Lavinia in jerky monosyllables,--the only speech that the noise made possible,--I
had a chance to look at him. He did not possess a single feature of classic proportions, and
yet he was a handsome man, owing to the illumination of his face. Brown, introspective eyes,
with a merry way of shutting; heavy, dark hair and brows, and a few thoughtful lines here and
there; mustache pulled down at the corners, as if by the unconscious weight of a nervously
strong hand; and a firm jaw, but not squared to the point that suggests the dominance of the
physical. He wore a dark gray Inverness coat, evidently one of the fruits of his English tour,
and a well-proportioned soft felt hat, set on firmly, the crown creased in the precise way
necessary to justify the city use of the article by a man of thirty. He seemed to be in excellent,
almost boyish spirits, and so natural and wholesome withal, that I am sure I should not feel
at all embarrassed at finding myself alone with him on a desert island. This is one of my pet
similes of approval.

Finally he blurted out: "Miss Lavinia, I do so wish your advice upon a strictly woman's matter;
one, however, that is of great importance to me. I shall have to take the night express back,
and this is the only time I have left. Would you--could we go in somewhere, do you think, and
have something while I explain?"

Miss Lavinia looked dubious as to whether his invitation might mean drinks, man fashion, or
luncheon. But as at that moment we reached the chief New York residence of well-born ice cream
soda, for which I always hanker, in spite of snow and slush, much to Evan's disgust, I relieved
the situation by plunging in, saying that I was even more thirsty in winter than in summer.
Whereat Miss Lavinia shivered, but cheerfully resigned herself to hot chocolate.  "The matter
in point is," continued Bradford, feeling boyishly of one of the blocks of ice that decorated
the counter to find if it was real, and speaking directly to Miss Lavinia, "I've had a great
happiness come into my life this last week; something that I did not expect to happen for years.
My chief has retired, and I have been promoted. I will not take your time to go selfishly into
details now. I can tell you to-night, if you care to hear. I cannot go home until the Easter
holidays, and so I want to send something to my mother by way of celebration. Would you select
it for me?" and the big fellow swept the shop with an indefinite sort of gaze, as if buying
candy for the universe would but feebly express his feelings.

"Certainly I will," replied Miss Lavinia, warming at once;--"but what kind of something?"

"I think,"--hesitating a trifle,--"a very good gown, and an ornament of some kind."

"Would she not prefer choosing the gown herself? People's tastes differ so much about clothing,"
ventured Miss Lavinia, willing, even anxious, to help the man, yet shrinking from the possibility
of feminine criticism.

"No, I think not; that is, it doesn't work well. Beforetimes I've often written her to buy
some little finery to wear for my sake, but my gift has generally been turned into flannels
for poor children or to restock the chickenyard of some unfortunate neighbour whose fowls have
all died of gapes. While if I send her the articles themselves, she will prize and wear them,
even if the gown was a horse blanket and the ornament a Plymouth Rock rooster to wear on her
head. You know how mothers are about buying things for themselves, don't you, Mrs. Evan?" he
said, turning to me, that I need not consider myself excluded from the conversation.

"I have no mother, but I have two little sons," I answered.

"Ah, then you will know as soon as they grow old enough to wish to buy things for you," and
somehow the soda water flew up my nose, and I had to grope for my handkerchief.

Miss Lavinia evidently did not like to ask Mrs. Bradford's age, so she evaded it by asking,
"Does your mother wear colours or black, Mr. Bradford?"

"She has worn black ever since my father died; for the last ten years, in fact. I wish I could
persuade her to adopt something that looks more cheerful, for she is the very essence of cheerfulness
herself. Do you think this would be a good time to give a sort of hint by choosing a coloured
gown,--a handsome blue silk, for instance?"  "I know precisely how you feel," said Miss Lavinia,
laying her hand upon his sleeve sympathetically, "men never like mourning; but still I advise
you not to try the experiment or force the change. A brocaded black silk gown, with a pretty
lace fichu to soften it about the shoulders, and a simple pin to hold it together at the neck,--how
would that suit you?" As she spoke she waved her dainty hands about so expressively in a way
of her own that I could seem to see the folds of the material drape themselves.

"That is it! You have exactly the idea that I could not formulate. How clever women are!" he
exclaimed, and for a minute I really thought he was going to hug Miss Lavinia.

"One other favour. Will you buy these things for me? I always feel so out of place and cowardly
in the women's shops where such things are sold. Will $100 be enough, think you?" he added
a trifle anxiously, I thought, as he drew a small envelope from a compartment of his letter
book, where it had evidently been stowed away for this special purpose.

"Yes, I can manage nicely with it," replied Miss Lavinia, cheerfully; "and now you must leave
us at once, so that we can do this shopping, and not be too late for luncheon. Remember, dinner
to-night at 6:30."  "One thing more," he said, as we turned to leave, "I shall not now have
time to present my respects to Miss Latham's mother as I intended; do you think that she will
hold me very rude? I remember that Miss Sylvia once said her mother was very particular in
matters of etiquette,--about her going out unchaperoned and all that,--and should not wish
her to feel slighted." Miss Lavinia assured him very dryly that he need not worry upon that
score, that no notice would be taken of the omission. Not saying, however, that in all probability
he was entirely unconsidered, ranked as a tutor and little better than a governess by the elder
woman, even if Sylvia had spoken of him as her instructor.

So, after holding open the heavy doors for us, he strode off down town, the bright smile still
lingering about his eyes, while we retraced our steps to the shop we had visited early that
morning, and then down again to a jeweller's. The result was a dress pattern of soft black
silk, brocaded with a small leafy design, a graceful lace-edged, muslin fichu, and an onyx
bar pin upon which three butterflies were outlined by tiny pearls.

"Isn't he a dear fellow?" asked Miss Lavinia, apparently of a big gray truck horse that blocked
the way as we waited at the last crossing before reaching home. And I replied, "He certainly
is," with rash but unshakable feminine conviction.

VII

SYLVIA LATHAM

Sylvia came that afternoon well before dark, a trim footman following from the brougham with
her suitcase and an enormous box of forced early spring flowers, hyacinths, narcissi, tulips,
English primroses, lilies-of-the-valley, white lilacs, and some yellow wands of Forsythia,
"with Mrs. Latham's compliments to Miss Dorman."

"What luxury!" exclaimed Miss Lavinia, turning out the flowers upon the table in the tea room
where she kept her window garden, "and how pale and spindling my poor posies look in comparison.
Are these from the Bluffs?"

"Oh no, from Newport," replied Sylvia. "There is to be no glass at the Bluffs, only an outdoor
garden, mamma says, that will not be too much trouble to keep up. Mrs. Jenks-Smith was dining
at the house last night, and told me what a lovely garden you have, Mrs. Evan, and I thought
perhaps, if we do not go to California to meet father, but go to Oaklands early in April, you
might be good enough to come up and talk my garden over with me. The landscape architect has,
I believe, made a plan for the beds and walks about the house, but I am to have an acre or
two of ground on the opposite side of the highway quite to myself.

"Oh, please don't squeeze those tulips into the tight high vases, Aunt Lavinia," she said,
going behind that lady and giving her a hug with one arm, while she rescued the tulips with
the other hand; for Miss Lavinia, feeling hurried and embarrassed by the quantity of flowers,
was jumbling them at random into very unsuitable receptacles.

"May I arrange the dinner table," Sylvia begged, "like a Dutch garden, with a path all around,
beds in the corners, and those dear little silver jugs and the candlesticks for a bower in
the middle?

"A month ago," she continued, as she surveyed the table at a glance and began to work with
charming enthusiasm, "mamma was giving a very particular dinner. She had told the gardener
to send on all the flowers that could possibly be cut, so that there were four great hampers
full; but owing to some mistake Darley, the florist, who always comes to decorate the rooms,
did not appear. We telephoned, and the men flew about, but he could not be found, and mamma
was fairly pale with anxiety, as Mrs. Center, who gives the swell dinner dances, was to dine
with her for the first time, and it was important to make an impression, so that I might be
invited to one or possibly more of these affairs, and so receive a sort of social hall mark,
without which, it seems, no young New York woman is complete. I didn't know the whole of the
reason then, to be sure, or very possibly I should not have worked so hard. Still, poor mamma
is so in earnest about all these little intricacies, and thinks them so important to my happiness
and fate, or something else she has in view, that I am trying not to undeceive her until the
winter is over."

Sylvia spoke with careless gayety, which was to my mind somehow belied by the expression of
her eyes.

"I asked Perkins to get out the Dutch silver, toys and all, that mamma has been collecting
ever since I can remember, and bring down a long narrow mirror in a plain silver frame that
backs my mantel shelf. Then I begged mother to go for her beauty sleep and let me wrestle with
the flowers, also to be sure to wear her new Van Dyck gown to dinner.

"This was not according to her plan, but she went perforce. I knew that she felt extremely
dubious, and, trembling at my rashness, I set at work to make a Dutch flower garden, with the
mirror for a canal down the centre. Perkins and his understudies, Potts and Parker, stood watching
me with grim faces, exchanging glances that seemed to question my sanity when I told Parker
to go out to the corner where I had seen workmen that afternoon dump a load of little white
pebbles, such as are used in repairing the paving, and bring me in a large basketful. But when
the garden was finished, with the addition of the little Delft windmills I brought home, and
the family of Dutch peasant dolls that we bought at the Antwerp fair, Perkins was absolutely
moved to express his approval."

"What effect did the garden have upon the dance invitations?" asked Miss Lavinia, highly amused,
and also more eager to hear of the doings of society than she would care to confess.

"Excellent! Mrs. Center asked mother who her decorator was, and said she should certainly employ
him; which, it seems, was a compliment so rare that it was equivalent to the falling of the
whole social sky at my feet, Mr. Bell said, who let the secret out. I was invited to the last
two of the series,--for they come to a conspicuous stop and turn into theatre parties when
Lent begins,--and I really enjoyed myself, the only drawback being that so few of the really
tall and steady men care for dancing. Most of my partners were very short, and loitered so,
that I felt top-heavy, and it reminded me of play-days, when I used to practise waltzing with
the library fire tongs.  I dislike long elaborate dinners, though mamma delights in them, and
says one may observe so much that is useful, but I do like to dance with a partner who moves,
and not simply progresses in languid ripples, for dancing is one of the few indoor things that
one is allowed to do for oneself.

"Now, Aunt Lavinia, you see the garden is all growing and blowing, and there are only enough
tulips left for the Rookwood jars in the library," Sylvia said, stepping back to look at the
table, "and a few for us to wear. Lilies-of-the-valley for you, pink tulips for you, Mrs. Evan,--they
will soon close, and look like pointed rosebuds,--yellow daffies to match my gown, and you
must choose for the two men I do not know. I'll take a tuft of these primroses for Mr. Bradford,
and play they grew wild. We always joked him about these flowers at college until 'The Primrose'
came to be his nickname among ourselves. Why?

"One day when he was lecturing to us on Wordsworth, and reading examples of different styles
and metres, he finished a rather sentimental phrase with

"'A primrose by a river's brim A yellow primrose was to him And it was nothing more.'

"Suddenly, the disparity between the bigness of the reader and the slimness of the verse overcame
me, and catching his eye, I laughed aloud. Of course, the entire class followed in a chorus,
which he, catching the point, joined heartily. It sounds silly now, but it seemed very funny
at the time; and it is such little points that make events at school, and even at college."

"Mr. Bradford told me some news this morning," said Miss Lavinia, walking admiringly about
the table as she spoke. "He is Professor Bradford, of the University, not merely the women's
college now, or rather will be at the beginning of the next term."

"That is pleasant news. I wonder how old Professor Jameson happened to step out, and why none
of the Rockcliffe girls have written me about it."

"He did not tell me any details; said that they would keep until to-night. We met him in the
street this morning, immediately after we left you," and Miss Lavinia gave a brief account
of our shopping.

"That sounds quite like him. All his air castles seemed to be built about his mother and the
old farm at Pine Ridge. He has often told me how easy it would be to get back the house to
the colonial style, with wide fireplaces, that it was originally, and he always had longings
to be in a position to coax his mother to come to Northbridge for the winter, and keep a little
apartment for him. Perhaps he will be able to do both now."

Sylvia spoke with keen but quite impersonal interest, and looking at her I began to wonder
if here might not, after all, be the comrade type of woman in whose existence I never before
believed,--feminine, sympathetic, buoyant, yet capable of absolutely rational and unemotional
friendship with a man within ten years of her own age. But after all it is common enough to
find the first half of such a friendship, it is the unit that is difficult; and I had then
had no opportunity of seeing the two together.

We went upstairs together, and lingered by the fire in Miss Lavinia's sitting room before going
to make ready for dinner. The thaw of the morning was again locked by ice, and it was quite
a nippy night for the season. I, revelled mentally in the fact that my dinner waist was crimson
in colour, and abbreviated only in the way of elbow sleeves, and the pretty low corn-coloured
crêpe bodice that I saw Lucy unpacking from Sylvia's suit case quite made me shiver.

The only light in Miss Lavinia's den, other than the fire, was a low lamp, with a soft-hued
amber shade, so that the room seemed to draw close about one like protecting arms, country
fashion, instead of seeking to turn one out, which is the feeling that so many of the stately
apartments in the great city houses give me.

When I am indoors I want space to move and breathe in, of course, but I like to feel intrenched;
and only when I open the door and step outside, do I wish to give myself up to space, for Nature
is the only one who really knows how to handle vastness without overdoing it.

As we sat there in silence I watched the play of firelight on Sylvia's face, and the same thought
seemed to cross it as she closed her eyes and nestled back in Miss Lavinia's funny little fat
sewing chair, that was like a squab done in upholstery. Then, as the clock struck six, she
started, rubbed her eyes, and crossed the hall to her room half in a dream.

"She is as like her Grandmother Latham when I first saw her, as a girl of twenty-one can be
like a woman of fifty," said Miss Lavinia, from the lounge close at my elbow. "Not in colouring
or feature, but in poise and gesture. The Lathams were of Massachusetts stock, and have, I
imagine, a good deal of the Plymouth Rock mixture in their back-bones. Her father has the reputation,
in fact, of being all rock, if not quite of the Plymouth variety. Well, I think she will need
it, poor child; that is, if any of the rumours that are beginning to float in the air settle
to the ground."

"Meaning what?" I asked, half unconsciously, and paying little heed, for I then realized that
the daily letter from father had not arrived; and Lucy at that moment came in, lit the lamps,
and began to rattle the hair-brushes in Miss Lavinia's bedroom, which I took as a signal for
me to leave.

The door-bell rang. It was Evan; but before I met him halfway on the stairs, he called up:
"I telephoned home an hour ago, and they are all well. The storm held over last night there.
Father says it was the most showy snow they have had for years, and he was delayed in getting
his letter to the post."

"Is that all?" I asked, as I got down far enough to rest my hands on his shoulders.

"Yes; the wires buzzed badly and did not encourage gossip. Ah!" (this with an effort to appear
as if it was an afterthought), "I told him I thought that you would not wait for me tomorrow,
but probably go home on the 9:30. Not that I really committed you to it if you have other plans!"

       *       *       *       *       *

Martin Cortright appeared some five minutes before Horace Bradford. As it chanced, when the
latter came in the door Sylvia was on the stairs, so that her greeting and hearty handshake
were given looking down at him, and she waited in the hall, in a perfectly unembarrassed way,
as a matter of course, while he freed himself from his heavy coat. His glance at the tall girl,
who came down from the darkness above, in her shimmering gown, with golden daffies in her hair
and on her breast, like a beam of wholesome sunshine, was full of honest, personal admiration.
If it had been otherwise I should have been disappointed in the man's completeness. Then, looking
at them from out of the library shadows, I wondered what he would have thought if his entry
had been at the Latham home instead of at Miss Lavinia's, how he would have passed the ordeal
of Perkins, Potts, and Parker, and if his spontaneity would have been marred by the formality.

Perhaps he would have been oblivious. Some men have the happy gift of not being annoyed by
things that are thorns in the flesh to otherwise quite independent women. Father, however,
is always amused by flunkies, and treats them as an expected part of the show; even as the
jovial Autocrat did when, at a grand London house, "it took full six men in red satin knee-breeches"
to admit him and his companion.

Bradford did not wear an evening suit; neither did he deem apology necessary. If he thought
of the matter at all, which I doubt, he evidently considered that he was among friends, who
would make whatever excuses were necessary from the circumstances of his hurried trip.

Then we went in to the dining-room, Miss Lavinia leading with Martin Cortright, as the most
recent acquaintance, and therefore formal guest, the rest of us following in a group. Miss
Lavinia, of course, took the head of the table, Evan opposite, and the two men, Cortright on
her right and Bradford on her left, making Sylvia and me vis-à-vis.

The men appropriated their buttonhole flowers naturally. Martin smiled at my choice for him,
which was a small, but chubby, red and yellow, uncompromising Dutch tulip, far too stout to
be able to follow its family habit of night closing, except to contract itself slightly. Evan
caressed his lilies-of-the-valley lightly with his finger-tips as he fastened them in place,
but Bradford broke into a boyish laugh, and then blushed to the eyes, when he saw the tiny
bunch of primroses, saying: "You have a long memory, Miss Sylvia, yet mine is longer. May I
have a sprig of that, too?" and he reached over a big-boned hand to where the greenhouse-bred
wands of yellow Forsythia were laid in a formal pattern bordering the paths. "That is the first
flower that I remember. A great bush of it used to grow in a protected spot almost against
the kitchen window at home; and when I see a bit of it in a strange place, for a minute I collapse
into the little chap in outrageous gathered trousers, who used to reach out the window for
the top twigs, that blossomed earliest, so as to be the first to carry 'yellow bells' to school
for a teacher that I used to think was Venus and Minerva rolled in one. I saw her in Boston
the other day, and the Venus hallucination is shattered, but the yellow bells look just the
same, proving--"

"That every prospect pleases And man (or woman) alone is vile,"

interpolated Evan.

Grape fruit, with a dash of sherry, or the more wholesome sloe-gin, is Miss Lavinia's compromise
with the before-dinner cocktail of society, that is really very awakening to both brain and
digestion; and before the quaint silver soup tureen had disappeared, even Martin Cortright
had not only come wholly out of his shell, but might have been said to have fairly perched
on top of it, before starting on a reminiscent career with his hostess, beginning at one of
the monthly meetings of the Historical Society; for though Martin's past belonged more to the
"Second Avenue" faction of the old east side, and Miss Lavinia to the west, among the environs
of what had once been Greenwich and Chelsea villages, they had trodden the same paths, though
not at the same time. While Sylvia and the "Professor," as she at once began to call him, picked
up the web of the college loom that takes in threads of silk, wool, and cotton, and mixing
or separating them at random, turns out garments of complete fashion and pattern, or misfits
full of false starts or dropped stitches that not only hamper the wearers, but sometimes their
families, for life. All that Evan and I had to do was to maintain a sympathetic silence, kept
by occasional ejaculations and murmurs from growing so profound as to cause a draught at our
corner of the table.  "Yes, we used to go there regularly," I heard Miss Lavinia say; "when
we were girls Eleanor (Barbara's mother) and I attended the same school--Miss Black's,--Eleanor
being a boarding and I a day pupil and a clergyman's daughter also, which, in those days, was
considered a sort of patent of respectability. Miss Black used to allow her to spend the shorter
holidays with me and go to those historical lectures as a matter of course. We never publicly
mentioned the fact that Eleanor also liked to come to my house to get thoroughly warmed and
take a bath, as one of Miss Black's principles of education was that feminine propriety and
cold rooms were synonymous, and the long room with a glass roof, sacred to bathing, was known
as the 'refrigerator'; but those atrocities that were committed in the name of education have
fortunately been stopped by education itself. I don't think that either of us paid much attention
to the lectures; the main thing was to get out and go somewhere; yet I don't think any other
later good times were as breathlessly fascinating.

"Mother seldom went, the hermetically sealed, air-proof architecture of the place not agreeing
with her; so father, Eleanor, and I used to walk over, crossing the head of Washington Square,
until, as we passed St. Mark's Church and reached the steps of the building, we often headed
a procession as sedate and serious as if going to Sunday meeting, for there were fewer places
to go in those days. Once within, we usually crept well up front, for my father was one of
the executive committee who sat in the row of chairs immediately facing the platform, and to
be near him added several inches to my stature and importance, at least in my own estimation.
Then, too, there was always the awesome and fascinating possibility that one of these honourable
personages might fall audibly asleep, or slip from his chair in a moment of relaxation. Such
events had been known to occur. In fact, my father's habit of settling down until his neck
rested upon the low chair back, made the slipping accident a perpetual possibility in his case.

"Then, when the meeting was called to order, and the minutes read with many h-hems and clearings
of the throat, and the various motions put to vote with the mumbled 'All-in-favour-of-the-motion-will-please-signify-
by-saying-Ay! Contrary-minded-no-the-motion-is-accepted!' that some one would only say 'No'
was our perpetual wish, and we even once meditated doing it ourselves, but could not decide
which should take the risk.

"Another one of our amusements was to give odd names to the dignitaries who presided. One with
lurching gait, erectile whiskers, and blinking eyes we called 'The Owl'; while another, a handsome
old man of the 'Signer' type, pink-cheeked, deep eyed, with a fine aquiline nose, we named
'The Eagle.'"

"Oh, I know whom you mean, exactly!" cried Martin, throwing back his head and laughing as heartily
as Bradford might; "and 'The Owl' was supposed to have intentions of perpetuating his name
by leaving the society money enough for a new building, but he didn't. But then, he doubtless
inherited his thrift from the worthy ancestors of the ilk of those men who utilized trousers
for a land measure. Do you also remember the discussions that followed the reading of paper
or lecture? Sometimes quite heated ones too, if the remarks had ventured to even graze the
historical bunions that afflicted the feet of many old families."

"No, I think we were too anxious to have the meeting declared adjourned to heed such things.
How we stretched ourselves; the physical oppression that had been settling for an hour or two
lifting suddenly as we got on our feet and felt that we might speak in our natural voices.

"Then father would say, 'You may go upstairs and examine the curiosities before joining us
in the basement,' and we would go up timidly and inspect the Egyptian mummy. I wonder how he
felt last year when there was a reception in the hall and a band broke the long stillness with
'The Gay Tomtit.' Was ever such chocolate or such sandwiches served in equally sepulchral surroundings
as in the long room below stairs. I remember wondering if the early Christians ever lunched
in the catacombs, and how they felt; and I should not have been surprised if Lazarus himself
had appeared in one of the archways trailing his graveclothes after him, so strong was the
spell of the mummy upon us.

"It seems really very odd that you were one of those polite young men who used sometimes to
pass the plates of sandwiches to us where we stayed hidden in a corner so that the parental
eye need not see how many we consumed."

Thus did Martin Cortright and Miss Lavinia meet on common ground and drift into easy friendship
which it would have taken years of conventional intercourse to accomplish, while opposite,
the talk between Sylvia and Bradford dwelt upon the new professorship and Sylvia's roommate
of two years, who, instead of being able to remain and finish the course which was to fit her
for gaining nominal independence through teaching, had been obliged to go home and take charge,
owing to her mother's illness.

"Yes, Professor Jameson's decision to give all his time to outside literary work was very sudden,"
I heard Bradford say. "I thought that it might happen two or three years hence; but to find
myself now not only in possession of a salary of four thousand dollars a year (hardly a fortune
in New York, I suppose), but also freed this season from being tied at Northbridge to teach
in the summer school, and able to be at home in peace and quiet and get together my little
book of the 'Country of the English Poets,' seems to me almost unbelievable."

"I have been wondering how the book was coming on, for you never wrote of it," answered Sylvia.
"I have been trying all winter, without success, to arrange my photographs in scrap-books with
merely names and dates. But though, as I look back over the four months, everything has been
done for me, even to the buttoning of my gloves, while I've seemingly done nothing for any
one, I've barely had a moment that I could call my own."

"I do not think that it is strange, after having been away practically for six years, that
family life and your friends should absorb you. Doubtless you will have time now that Lent
has come," said Bradford, smiling. "Of course we country Congregationalists do not treat the
season as you Anglican Catholics do, and I've often thought it rather a pity. It must be good
to have a stated time and season for stopping and sitting down to look at oneself. I picked
up one of your New York church papers in the library the other day, and was fairly surprised
at the number of services and the scope of the movement and the work of the church in general."

Sylvia looked at him for a moment with an odd expression in her eyes, as if questioning the
sincerity of his remarks, and then answered, I thought a little sadly: "I'm afraid it is very
much like other things we read of in the papers, half truth, half fiction; the churches and
the services are there, and the good earnest people, too--but as for our stopping! Ah, Mr.
Bradford, I can hardly expect to make you understand how it is, for I cannot myself. It was
all so different before I went to boarding school, and we lived down in the house in Waverley
Place where I was born. The people of mamma's world do not stop; we simply whirl to a slightly
different tune. It's like waltzing one way around a ballroom until you are quite dizzy, and
then reversing,--there is no sitting down to rest, that is, unless it is to play cards."

"Yet whist is a restful game in itself," said Bradford, cheerfully; "an evening of whist, with
even fairly intelligent partners, I've always found a great smoother-out of nerves and wrinkles."

"They do not play it that way here," answered Sylvia, laughing, in spite of herself, at his
quiet assumption. "It's 'bridge' for money or expensive prizes; and compared to the excitement
it causes, the tarantella is a sitting-down dance. I'm too stupid with cards to take the risk
of playing; even mamma does not advise it yet, though she wishes to have me coached. So I shall
have some time to myself after all, for my defect puts me out of three Lenten card clubs to
which mamma belongs, two of which meet at our house. That leaves only two sewing classes, three
Lenten theatre clubs (one for lunch and matinée and two for dinner and the evening), and Mr.
Bell's cake-walk club, that practises with a teacher at our house on Monday evenings. The club
is to have a semi-public performance at the Waldorf for charity, in Easter week, and as the
tickets are to be ten dollars each, they expect to make a great deal of money. So you see there
is very little time allowed us to sit down and look at ourselves."

"I cannot excuse cake-walking off the stage, among civilized people," interpolated Miss Lavinia,
catching the word but not the connection, and realizing that, as hostess, she had inconsiderately
lost the thread of the conversation. "It appeals to me as the expression of physical exuberance
of a lower race, and for people of our grade of intelligence to imitate it is certainly lowering!
The more successfully it is carried out the worse it is!"

Miss Lavinia spoke so fiercely that everybody laughed but Sylvia, who coloured painfully, and
Horace Bradford deftly changed the subject in the lull that followed.

       *       *       *       *       *

The men did not care to be left alone with their cigars and coffee, so we lingered in the dining-room.
Suddenly a shrieking whistle sounded in the street, and the rapid clatter of hoofs made us
listen, while Evan rushed to the door, seizing his hat on the way.

"Only the fire engines," said Miss Lavinia; "you would soon be used to them if you lived here;
the engine house is almost around the corner."

"Don't you ever go after them?" I asked, without thinking, because to Evan and me going to
fires is one of the standard attractions of our New York.

"Barbara, child, don't be absurd. What should I do traipsing after an engine?"

"Yet a good fire is a very exciting spectacle. I once had the habit of going," said Martin
Cortright, emerging from a cloud of cigar smoke. "I remember when Barnum's Museum was burned
my father and I ran to the fire together and stayed out, practically, all night."

More whistling and a fresh galloping of hoofs indicated that there was a second call, and the
engines from up town were answering. I began to tap my feet restlessly, and Miss Lavinia noticed
it.

"Don't hesitate to go if you wish to," she said. At the same moment Evan dashed back, calling:
"It's a fire on the river front, a lumber yard; plenty of work ahead, with little danger and
a wonderful spectacle. Why can we not all go to see it, for it's only half a dozen blocks away?
Bundle up, though, it's bitterly cold."

Horace Bradford sprang to his feet and Sylvia was halfway upstairs and fairly out of her evening
gown when Miss Lavinia made up her mind to go also, Evan's words having the infection of a
stampede.

"Don't forget the apples," I called to Evan as I followed my hostess.

"The shops and stands are closed, I'm afraid," he called back from the stoop where he was waiting;
"perhaps Miss Lavinia has some in the house."

"Apples, yes, plenty; but for mercy's sake what for? You surely aren't thinking of pelting
the fire out with them!" she gasped, hurrying downstairs and struggling to disentangle her
eyeglasses from her bonnet strings; a complication that was always happening at crucial moments,
such as picking out change in an elevated railway station, and thereby blocking the crowd.

"No, apples to feed the fire horses; Barbara always does," Evan answered, dashing down the
basement stairs to the kitchen, and returning quickly with a medley of apples and soup vegetables
in a dish-towel bundle, leaving the solemn cook speechlessly astonished.

Then we started off, Evan leading the way, and the procession straggling after in Indian file;
for the back streets were not well shovelled, and to go two abreast meant that one foot of
each was on a side hill. Evan fairly dragged me along. Sylvia and Bradford, being fleet of
foot, had no difficulty in following, but Martin and Miss Lavinia had rather a bumpy time of
it. Still, as pretty much all the uncrippled inhabitants of the district were going the same
way, our flight was not conspicuous.

It was, as Evan had promised, a glorious fire! Long before we reached the Hudson the sky rayed
and flamed with all the smokeless change of the Northern Lights. Once there, Evan piloted us
through the densely packed crowd to the side string-piece of a pier, Miss Lavinia giving little
shrieks the while, and begging not to be pushed into the water.

From this point the great stacks of lumber that made the giant bonfire could be seen at the
two points, from land and water side, where the fire-boats were shooting streams from their
well-aimed nozzles.

As usual, after running the steam-pumping engines as close as desirable to the flames, the
horses were detached, blanketed, and tied up safe from harm, and we found a group of three
great intelligent iron-gray beauties close behind us, who accepted the contents of the dish-towel
with almost human appreciation, while a queer, wise, brown dog, an engine mascot, who was perched
on the back of the middle horse, shared the petting with a politely matter-of-fact air.

"It is wonderful! I only wish I could see a little better," murmured Miss Lavinia, who was
short, and buried in the crowd.

"Why not stand on this barrel?" suggested Bradford, holding out his hand.

"It's full of garbage and ashes," she objected.

"Never mind that, they are frozen hard," replied Bradford, poking the mass practically.

Three pairs of hands tugged and boosted, and lo! Miss Lavinia was safely perched; and as there
were more barrels Sylvia and I quickly followed suit, and we soon all became spellbound at
the dramatic contrasts, for every now and again a fresh pile of Georgia pine would be devoured
by the flames, the sudden flare coming like a noiseless explosion, making the air fragrantly
resinous, while at the same time the outer boundaries of the doomed lumber yard were being
draped with a fantastic ice fabric from the water that froze as it fell.

As to the firemen! don't talk to me of the bygone bravery of the crusaders and the lords of
feudal times, who spent their lives in the sport of encamping outside of fortresses, at whose
walls they occasionally butted with rams, lances, and strong language, leaving their wives
and children in badly drained and draughty castles. If any one wishes to see brave men and
true, simply come to a fire with Evan and me in our New York.

We might have stood there on our garbage pedestals half the night if Horace Bradford had not
remembered that he must catch the midnight express, glanced at his watch, found that it was
already nearly half-past ten, and realized that he had left his grip at Miss Lavinia's. Consequently
we dismounted and pushed our way home.

As we were half groping our way up ill-lighted West Tenth Street Martin Cortright paused suddenly
and, after looking about, remarked: "This is certainly a most interesting locality. That building
opposite, which has long been a brewery, was once, in part at least, the first city or State's
Prison. How often criminals must have traversed this very route we are following, on their
way to Washington Square to be hanged. For you know that place, of later years esteemed so
select, was once not only the site of Potter's Field, but of the city gallows as well!"

No one, however, joined more heartily than he in the merriment that his inapropos reminiscence
caused, and we reached home in a good humour that effectually kept off the cold.

"Did you succeed in buying the gown?" Horace Bradford asked Miss Lavinia, as he stood in the
hall making his farewells.

"Oh, yes, I had almost forgotten. Here is the package only waiting for your approval to be
tied," and she led the way to the library.

Bradford touched the articles with his big fingers, as lovingly as if he were smoothing his
mother's hair, or her hand.

"They are exactly right," he said heartily, turning and grasping Miss Lavinia's hand, as he
looked straight into her eyes with an expression of mingled gratitude and satisfaction. "She
will thank you herself, when we all meet next summer," and with a happy look at Sylvia, who
had come to the library to see the gifts, and was leaning on the table, he grasped bag and
parcel, shook hands all round, and hurried away.

"What do you think?" I asked Evan, as we closed our bedroom door.

"Of what?" he answered, with the occasional obtuseness that will overtake the best of men.

"Of Sylvia and Bradford, of course. Are they in love, do you think?"

"I rather think that he is," Evan answered, slowly, as if bringing his mind from afar, "but
that he doesn't know it, and I hope he may stay in ignorance, for it will do him no good, for
I am sure that she is not, at least with Bradford. She is drifting about in the Whirlpool now.
She has not 'found herself' in any way, as yet. She seems a charming girl, but I warn you,
Barbara, don't think you scent romance, and try to put a finger in this pie! Your knowledge
of complex human nature isn't nearly as big as your heart, and the Latham set are wholly beyond
your ken and comprehension." Then Evan, declining to argue the matter, went promptly to sleep.

Not so Sylvia. When Miss Lavinia went to her room to see if the girl was comfortable and have
a little go-to-bed chat by the fire, she found her stretched upon the bed; her head hidden
between the pillows, in a vain effort to stifle her passionate sobbing.

"What is it, my child?" she asked, truly distressed. "Are you tired, or have you taken cold,
or what?"

"No, nothing like that," she whispered, keeping her face hidden and jerking out disjointed
sentences, "but I can't do anything for anybody. No one really depends on me for anything.
Helen Baker must leave college, because they need her at home,--just think, need her! Isn't
that happiness? And Mr. Bradford is so joyful over his new salary, thinks it is a fortune,
and with being able to buy those things for his mother,--father has sent me more money during
the four months I've been back, so I may feel independent, he says, than the Professor will
earn in a year. Independent? deserted is a better word! I hardly know my own parents, I find,
and they expect nothing from me, even my companionship.

"Before I went away to school, if mamma was ill, I used to carry up her breakfast, and brush
her hair; now she treats me almost like a stranger,--dislikes my going to her room at odd times.
I hardly ever see her, she is always so busy, and if I beg to be with her, as I did once, she
says I do not understand her duty to society.

"People should not have children and then send them away to school until they feel like strangers,
and their homes drift so far away that they do not know them when they come back,--and there's
poor Carthy out west all alone, after the plans we made to be together. It is all so different
from what I expected. Why does not father come home, or mother seem to mind that he stays away?
What is the matter, Aunt Lavinia? Is mamma hiding something, or is the fault all mine?"

Miss Lavinia closed the door, and soothed the excited girl, talking to her for an hour, and
in fact slept on the lounge, and did not return to her own room until morning. She was surprised
at the storm in a clear sky, but not at the cause. Miss Lavinia was keenly observant, and from
two years' daily intercourse, she knew Sylvia's nature thoroughly. For some reasons, she wished
with all her heart that Sylvia was in love with Horace Bradford, and at the same time feared
for it; but before the poor girl fell asleep, she was convinced that such was not the case,
and that the trouble that was already rising well up from her horizon was something far more
complicated.

VIII

THE SWEATING OF THE CORN

April 14. Every one who has led, even in a partial degree, the life outdoors, must recognize
his kinship with the soil. It was the first recorded fact of race history embodied in the Old
Testament allegory of the creation, and it would seem from the beginning that nations have
been strong or weak, as they acknowledged or sought to suppress it.

I read a deeper meaning in my garden book as the boys' human calendar runs parallel with it,
and I can see month by month and day by day that it is truly the touch of Nature that makes
kindred of us all--the throb of the human heart and not the touch of learning or the arts.

Everything grows restless as spring comes on--animate, and what is called inanimate, nature.
March is the trying month of indecision, the tug-of-war between winter and spring, pulling
us first one way and then the other, the victory often being, until the final moment, on the
side of winter. Then comes a languid period of inaction, and a swift recovery. When the world
finally throws off frost bondage, sun and the earth call, while humanity, indoors and out,
in city tenement as well as in farmhouse, hears the voice, even though its words are meaningless,
and grows restless.

Lavinia Dorman writes that she is feeling tired and low-spirited, the doctor has advised a
tonic, and she misses the change of planting her back-yard garden. Down in the streets the
tenement children are swarming in the sunny spots, and dancing to the hand-organs. I saw them
early last week when I was in town for a few hours.

In one of the downtown parks the youngsters were fairly rolling in the dirt, and rubbing their
cheeks on the scanty grass as they furtively scooped up handfuls of cement-like soil to make
mud pies, in spite of the big policeman, who, I like to think, was sympathetically blind.

The same impulse stirs my boys, even though they have all outdoors around them. They have suddenly
left their house toys and outdoor games alike to fairly burrow in the soil. The heap of beach
sand and pebbles that was carted from the shore and left under an old shed for their amusement,
has lost its charm. They go across the road and claw the fresh earth from an exposed bank,
using fingers instead of their little rakes and spades, and decorate the moist brown "pies"
they make with dandelion ornaments.

A few days ago the Vanderveer boy came down to play with them, accompanied by an English head
nurse of tyrannical mien, and an assortment of coats and wraps. The poor little chap had been
ailing half the winter, it seems, with indigestion and various aches, until the doctor told
his mother that she must take him to the country and try a change, as he feared the trouble
was chronic appendicitis; so the entire establishment has arrived to stay until the Newport
season, and the boy's every movement is watched, weighed, and discussed.

The nurse, having tucked him up in a big chair in the sun on the porch, with the boys for company,
and in charge of father, who was looking at him with a pitying and critical medical eye, said
she would leave him for half an hour while she went up the lane to see Martha Corkle. A few
moments after, as I glanced across the road, I saw my boys burrowing away at their dirt bank,
and their guest with them. I flew downstairs to call him in, fearing for the consequences,
but father, who was watching the proceedings from the porch, laid a detaining hand upon me,
saying: "His mother has consulted me about the child, and really sent him down here that I
may look him over, and I am doing it, in my own fashion. I've no idea the trouble is appendicitis,
though it might be driven that way. I read it as a plain case of suppressed boyhood.

"He doesn't know how to play, or run naturally without falling; he's afraid to sit down in
the dirt--no wonder with those starched linen clothes; and he keeps looking about for the nurse,
first over one shoulder and then over the other, like a hunted thing. Evidently they have weighed
his food, measured his exercise, and bought his amusements; his only free will and vent is
to get in a temper. They give him no chance to sweat off his irritation, only to fume; while
that shaking, snorting teakettle of an automobile they bowl him about in, puts the final touch
to his nervousness."

Then I sat down by father and watched the three boys together, while Richard was preventing
his guest from pounding a toad with a stone because it preferred to hop away instead of being
made into a dirt pie, and I saw the truth of what he said. The seven-year-old child who went
to riding school, dancing school, and a military drill, did not know how to express his emotions
in play, and frozen snowballs and other cruelty was his distorted idea of amusement. Poor rich
boy, sad little only son, he was not allowed the freedom to respond to the voice of nature
even as the tenement children that dance in the streets to the hand-organs or stir the mud
in the gutter with their bare toes. It is not the tenement children of New York who are to
be pitied; it is those that are being fitted to keep the places, in the unstable and frail
crafts of the Whirlpool, that their parents are either striving to seize or struggling to reserve
for them.

At the end of half an hour the boys came back to the porch, all three delightfully and completely
dirty, and clamouring that they were hungry. The English tyrant not appearing, I took them
into the house and, after a washing of hands and faces, gave the boys the usual eleven o'clock
lunch of milk and simple cookies to take out in the sun to eat. As they were thus engaged the
tyrant appeared on the horizon, horror written in every feature, and a volley of correction
evidently taking shape on her lips, while an ugly look of cowed defiance spread itself over
the child's face as he caught sight of her.

There was no scene, however. Father said in the most offhand way, as if being obeyed was a
matter of course, "Go back and tell your mistress that I am carrying out her request, and that
after luncheon I will send the boy safely home, with a written message."

"But his medicines, his hour's rest alone in the dark, his special food,--the medical man in
New York said--" protested the woman, completely taken aback.

"You heard my message?" said father, cheerfully, and that was all.

"What are you going to advise?" I asked, as in the middle of the afternoon father came from
his office, where he had given the lad a thorough inspection.

"Simply to turn him loose in light woollen clothes, give him companions of his age, and let
him alone."

"Can't you word it differently?" I asked.

"Why, is not that fairly direct?" he replied, looking surprised; "and surely the direct method
is almost always the best."

"I think this is the one case where it is not, dear old Daddy. In fact, if you are destined,
as I see that you are, to pick up and tie the threads of ravelled health in the Bluff Colony,
you will have to become more complicated, at least in speech, accustomed as they are to a series
of specialists, and having importance attached to the very key in which a sneeze is pitched.

"Those few words would savour to the Whirlpoolers of lack of proper respect and consideration.
You must give a name to both ailment and cure if you expect to be obeyed. Call the case a 'serious
one of physical suppression,' and the remedy the 'fresh earth cure,' to be taken only in light
woollen clothes, tell them to report progress to you every other day, and you gain the boy
his liberty."

Father laughed heartily, and his nose twitched in a curious way it has when he is secretly
amused and convinced against his will; but I think he took my advice, at least in part, for
the next morning Papa Vanderveer drove down in the brake, announcing in a shout that "De Peyster
slept all night without waking up and crying, for the first time in months," adding, "And,
Dr. Russell, if you've got anything further in this liberty line to suggest, even to getting
rid of the Duchess, now's your time. 'The Duchess?' Ah, she is that confounded head nurse woman
that Maria will keep so that things may be done properly, until the poor kid's nearly been
done for, I say. The Ponsonbys are crazy to get the woman to break in their youngest girl and
keep her down and from growing up until they marry the others off; so Maria could part with
her in the light of a favour to them, don't you see, without spilling blood. Peysey'll have
to have some sort of a chaser, though, or Maria'll not hear of it."

Mr. Vanderveer glowed all over with delight when father condemned the automobile as a nerve
racker, and suggested that a young man of the companionable tutor order, who could either play
games, fish, and drive with the boy and his chums, or at times leave him wholly alone, according
to need, would be a good substitute for a woman who viewed life as a school of don'ts, and
had either wholly outlived her youth, or else had most unpleasant recollections of it.

"I've got my innings at last," he said. "You're the first doctor I've had who hasn't sided
with Maria and shut me out until pay day."

"I wonder why spring is such a restless season," I said half to myself and half to father,
as I sat on the porch half an hour later, trying to focus my mind on writing to Lavinia Dorman,
while father, lounging on the steps opposite, was busy reading his mail.

"One would think we might be content merely to throw off winter and look and enjoy, but no,
every one is restless,--birds, fourfoots, and humans. Lavinia Dorman writes that Sylvia Latham
has just started for California to see her brother, and she expects to bring her father back
with her. The boys disappeared mysteriously in the direction of Martha Corkle's immediately
after breakfast, Evan went reluctantly to the train, declaring that it seemed impossible to
sit still long enough to reach the city, you are twisting about and shuffling your feet, looking
far oftener at the river woods than at your letters, and as for myself, it seems as if I must
go over yonder and seize Bertel's spade and show him how to dig those seed beds more rapidly,
so that I can begin to plant and kneel down and get close to the ground. Yesterday when the
boys came in with very earthy faces, and I questioned them, I found that they had stuck their
precious noses in their mud pies, essaying to play mole and burrow literally."

"It is the same mystery as the sweating of the corn," replied father, gathering his letters
in a heap and tossing them into a chair with a gesture of impatience; "none of us may escape,
even though we do not understand it.

"It was years ago that I first heard the legend from an old farmer of the corn belt, who, longing
for a sight of salt water, had drifted eastward into one of the little hill farms beyond the
charcoal camp. He had been bedridden nearly all winter, but uncomplainingly, his wife and daughter-in-law
caring for him, and it was not until the early part of May, when all the world was growing
green, that he began to mend and at the same time groan at his confinement.

"I tried to cheer him up, telling him that the worst was over, and that he soon would be about
again, and he replied: ''Tain't me that's doin' of it, Doctor, hit's the sweatin' of the corn.
You know everywhere in May folks be plantin' corn, the time bein' the sign that frost is over
and done with.' I nodded assent, and he continued: 'Now naterally there's lots of corn in ear
and shelled and ground to meal that isn't planted, and along as when the kernels in the ground
begins to swell and sprout, this other corn knows it and begins to heave and sweat, and if
it isn't handled careful-like, and taken in the air and cooled, it'll take on all sorts of
moulds and musts, and like as not turn useless. I holds it's just the same with folks,--when
springtime comes they fetch up restless and need the air and turning out to sweeten in the
sun until they settle down again, else their naturs turn sour, pisen'us, and unwholesome, breedin'
worms like sweated corn!'

"Since then I've heard it here and there in other words, but always the same motive, the old
miller holding it all fact and no legend at all, saying that if he can keep his surplus corn
from sweating and well aired through May and June, he never fears for it in the damper, more
potent August heat. One thing is certain, that in my practice in countryside, village, and
town, if strange doings break out and restless discontentment arises, it is never in winter,
when I should expect partial torpidity to breed unrest, but in the pushing season of renewal,
and, as the old man terms it, 'corn sweating.'"

       *       *       *       *       *

A little later I was going toward the garden when father called after me to say that he was
soon starting for a long trip, quite up to Pine Ridge, and that if I cared to go, taking a
lunch for both, it might give me a chance to "turn and sweeten" in the sun and cure my restlessness
with natural motion.

Go? Of course my heart leaped at the very thought, because, in spite of the boys, those long
drives with father have grown more precious as they grow more rare. But where were the twins?
They had disappeared under my very eyes; of a surety they must be at Martha's, but my conscience
smote me when, on glancing at the clock, I saw that it was two hours since they left the breakfast
table in their brand-new sailor suits, with the intention of showing them to her.

No, they were not at Martha's, and she came hurrying back with me, a very clucking hen of alarm.
Timothy Saunders, who had by that time brought round the horses in the stanhope, ventured the
opinion that they might be below, paddling in the duck pond, as all the village children gathered
there at the first warm weather, "jest fer all the world like gnats the sun's drawd oot."

They were not there! Father had disappeared to make some preparations for the drive, and so
I asked Timothy to drive with me along the highway toward the village. I did not feel exactly
worried, but then one never knows.

We had gone half a mile perhaps, vainly questioning every one, when I spied two small figures
coming across a field from the east, where the ground fell lower and lower for a mile or so
until it reached salt water.

"There be the lads!" shouted Timothy Saunders, as if I had been a hundred yards away, and deaf
at that; but the noise meant joy, so it was welcome. "My, but they're fagged and tattered well
to boot!" And so they were; but they struggled along, hand in hand, waving cheerfully when
they caught sight of me, and finally crept through the pasture bars by which I was waiting,
and enveloped me with faint, weary hugs. Then I noticed that they wore no hats, their fresh
suits were grimy with a gray dust like cement, the knees of their stockings and underwear were
worn completely through to red, scratched skin, and the tips entirely scraped from their shoes.

I gathered them into the gig, and sought the explanation as we drove homeward, Timothy hurried
by the vision of tearful Martha, whom he had seen with the tail of his eye dodge into the kitchen,
her apron over her head, as he turned out the gate.

"We've been playing we was moles," said Ian, in answer to the first question as to where they
had been. "Yesterday we tried to do it wif our own noses, but we couldn't, 'cause it hurt,
and we wanted to go ever so far."

"So we went down to where those big round stone pipes are in the long hole," said Richard,
picking up the story as Ian paused. (Workmen had been laying large cement sewer pipes from
the foot of the Bluffs, a third of a mile toward the marshes, but were not working that day,
owing to lack of material.) "They made nice mole holes, so I crawled right in, and for a little
it was bully fun."

"Oh Richard, Richard, what made you?" I cried, holding him so tight that he squirmed away.
"Suppose the other end had been closed, and you had smothered in there, and mother had never
found you?" for the ghastly possibility made my knees quake.

"Oh no, mother," he pleaded, taking my face between his grimy hands and looking straight in
my eyes, "it wasn't a dark hole. I could see it light out 'way at the other end, and it didn't
look so vely far as it was to crawl it. And after a little I'd have liked to back out, only--only,
well, you see, I couldn't."

"Why not?" I asked, and, as he did not answer, I again saw a vision of two little forms wedged
in the pipes.

"That why was 'cause I was in behind, and I wouldn't back, and so Dick couldn't," said Ian.
"You see, Barbara, I really, truly had to be a mole and get very far away, not to stay, only
just for fun, you know," he added, as he saw signs of tears in his brother's eyes, and began
to feel the smarting in his own bruised knees.

One blessed thing about Ian, even though he is sometimes passionate and stubborn, and will
probably have lots of trouble with himself by and by, there isn't a drop of sneaky cur blood
in him, which is the only trait that need make a mother tremble.

What should I do, punish, or act as I longed to, coddle the boys and comfort the poor knees?
True, I had not forbidden them to crawl through the sewer pipes, because the idea of their
doing it had never occurred to me, so they could not be said to have exactly disobeyed; but,
on the other hand, there was an unwritten law that they must not go off the place without my
permission, and the torn stockings furnished a hint.

"Mother is going away for all day with grandfather," I said slowly, as I examined their knees.
"Even though I never told you not to do it, if you had stopped to think, you would have known
it was wrong to crawl through the pipes."

"But, Barbara," argued Ian, as we reached the porch, "it wasn't us that crawled, it was moles,
and they just digs right ahead and turns up the ground and flowers and everything, and never
thinks things, do they, grandpop?"

"Martha will take you in," I said, steadying my voice with difficulty, "and bathe your knees
and let you rest a while before she dresses you again. Martha, please put away those stockings
for me to mend when I return; I cannot ask Effie to darn such holes for two little moles; she
is only engaged to sew for boys."

"But, mother, you don't like to sew stockings; it makes you tight in your chest. Engineering had happen

The village did not forget; it had observed and has begun to put in practice. The first symptom
was noticed by Evan. Last summer several family horses of respectable mien and Roman noses
appeared with their tails banged. Not docked, mind you, but squared-off as closely as might
be without resorting to cruelty; while their venerable heads, accustomed to turn freely and
look their drivers in the face reproachfully if kept standing too long, were held in place
by overdraw checks. At the same time the driver's seat in the buggy or runabout was raised
from beneath so as to tilt the occupant forward into an almost standing posture. This worked
well enough in an open wagon, but in a buggy the view was apt to be cut off by the hood, if
the driving lady (it was always a woman) was tall.

The second sign was when Mrs. Barton--a widow of some sixty odd years, with some pretensions
to breeding, but who had been virtually driven from several villages where she had located
since her widowhood, owing to inaccuracy of speech, beside which the words of the Village Liar
and the Emporium were quite harmless--contracted inflammatory rheumatism by chaperoning her
daughters' shore party and first wetting her lower half in clamming and then the upper via
a thunder shower. The five "Barton girls" range from twenty-five to forty, and are so mentally
and physically unattractive and maladroit that it would be impossible to regard them as in
any danger if they went unattended to the uttermost parts of the earth. On this particular
occasion the party consisted of two dozen people, ranging from twenty to fifty, which it would
seem afforded ample protection.

To be chaperoned was the swell thing, however, and chaperoned the "Barton girls" would be.

"I cannot compete with multi-millionnaires," said Mrs. Barton, lowering her voice, when father,
on being called in, asked if she had not been rather rash at her age to go wading in cold water
for clams; "but as a woman of the world I must do all that I can to follow the customs of good
society, and give my daughters protection from even a breath that might affect their reputations."

The drawling tone was such a good imitation of Mrs. Ponsonby's that father could barely control
his laughter, especially as she continued: "I also feel that I owe it to the neighbourhood
to do all in my power to put a stop to buggy riding, the vulgar recreation of the unmarried.
Of course all cannot afford suitable traps and grooms to attend them, but good form should
be maintained at all hazards, and mothers should not begrudge taking trouble."

Father said that the vision of shy young folks driving miserably along the country lanes on
Sunday afternoons in the family carryall, with mamma seated in the middle of the back seat,
rose so ludicrously before him that he was obliged to beat a retreat, promising to send a special
remedy for the rheumatism by Timothy Saunders.

All winter I have noticed that great local interest has been taken in the fashion journals
that treat of house decoration and etiquette, and on one occasion, when making a call at one
of our most comfortable farms, I found the worthy Deacon's wife poring over an ornamental volume,
entitled "Hints to those about to enter Society."

After she had welcomed me and asked me to "lay off" my things, she hesitated a moment, and
then, opening the book where her fat finger was keeping the place, she laid it on my lap, saying
in a whisper: "Would you tell me if that is true, Mrs. Evan? Lurella says you hobnob some with
the Bluff folks, and I wanted to make sure before we break it to pa."

The sentence to which she pointed read, "No gentleman will ever come to the table without a
collar, or be seen on porch or street in his shirt sleeves." Here, indeed, was a difficulty
and a difference. How should I explain?

I compromised feebly and advised her not to worry the Deacon about what the Bluff people did
or the book said, for it need not apply to the Cross Roads farmers.

"I'm reel glad you don't hold it necessary fer pa," she said with a sigh of relief; "he'd take
it so hard, eatin' gettin' him all het up anyhow. Now between ourselves, Mrs. Evan, don't you
think writ out manners is terrible confusin' and contradictin'? I wouldn't hev Lurella hear
me say so, she's so set on keepin' up with things, but she's over to town this afternoon.

"I've been readin' for myself some, and observin' too. The Bluff folks that plays grass hockey,
all over what was Bijah Woods's farm, men and girls both, has their sleeves pushed up as if
they were going at a day's wash, and their collars open and hanging to the hind button, which
to my mind looks shiftlesser than doin' without. I do hear also that those same girls when
they git in to dinner takes off their waists altogether and sets down to eat all stripped off
to a scrap of an underbody. That's true, for pa saw it when he was takin' cream over to Ponsonby's;
the windows was open on the piazza, and he couldn't refrain from peekin', though I hope you'll
not repeat. Of course they may feel dreadful sweaty after chasin' round in the sun all day,
though I wouldn't hold such sudden coolin' wholesome; but why if women so doin' should they
insist on men folks wearin' collars, say I?"

I told the dear soul that I had never quite been able to understand the reason why of many
of these things, and that my ways were also quite different from those of the Bluff people;
for though father and Evan had been brought up to wear collars, I had never yet stripped to
my underbody at dinner time.

Thus emboldened, she beckoned me mysteriously toward the best parlour, saying as she went,
"Lurella seen the picture of a Turkey room in the pattern book, and as she's goin' to have
a social this spring, she's fixed a corner of it into our north room."

When the light was let in I beheld a "cosey corner" composed of a very hard divan covered with
a broché shawl, and piled high with pillows of various hues, while a bamboo fishing-pole fastened
crosswise between the top of the window frames held a sort of beaded string drapery that hung
to the floor in front, and was gathered to the ceiling, in the corner, with a red rosette.
On close examination I found, to my surprise, that the trailers were made of strings of "Job's
Tears," the seed of a sort of ornamental maize, the thought of the labour that the thing had
involved fairly making my eyes ache.

"That is a very pretty shawl," I remarked, as no other truthful word of commendation seemed
possible.

"Yes, it is handsome, and I miss it dreadful. You see, it belonged to pa's mother, and I calkerlated
to wear it a lifetime for winter best, but the fashion papers do say shawls are out of it,
and this is the only use for them, which Lurella holds. I can't ever take the same comfert
in a bindin' sack, noway; and pa, he's that riled about the shawl bein' used to set on, I daren't
leave the door open. Says the whole thing's a 'poke hole,' and the curt'in recollects him of
'strings of spinnin' caterpillars,' and 'no beau that's worth his shoes won't ever get caught
in no such trap,' which is most tryin' to Lurella, so I hev to act pleased, and smooth things
over best I can."

Well-a-day, it is always easier to answer the riddles that puzzle others, rather than those
that confront ourselves.

Fully a year ago Mrs. Jenks-Smith gave me a well-meaning hint that it is not "good form" for
me to allow father or Evan to smoke while we drive or walk in public together. The very next
night we three happened to be dining, why I don't know, at the most socially advanced house
on the Bluffs. When the moment came for the midway pause in the rotation of foods, that we
might tamp down and make secure what we had already eaten by the aid of Roman punch, the gentlemen
very nearly discounted the effort, as far as I was concerned at least, by smoking cigarettes,
leaning easily back in their chairs, and with no more than a vague "by your leave," to the
ladies. What was more, there was a peculiarly sickening sweet odour to the smoke that father
afterward told me was because the tobacco was tinctured with opium. Yet it is "bad form" for
Evan and father to smoke in my society, out in the road or street under the big generous roof
of the sky. Dear little boys, I wonder what the custom will be when you are grown, and read
your mother's social experience book?

The present crisis to be faced is in the form of a wedding,--an apple-blossom wedding, to take
place in St. Peter's Church. I have been made a confident in the matter from the very beginning
of the wayside comedy which led to it; but I wish it understood that I am not responsible for
the list of invited guests, or the details of the ceremony, which have been laboriously compiled
from many sources, any more than I shall be for the heartburnings that are sure to follow in
its wake.

       *       *       *       *       *

One morning early last summer Fannie Penney was driving home from town, with a rather lopsided
load of groceries on the back of the buckboard. Fanny did not enjoy these weekly trips for
groceries, but she did not rebel, as her sisters did; and though she had aspirations, they
had not developed as quickly in her as in the others, for she was considered already an old
maid (a state that in the country, strangely enough, sets in long before it does in the city,
often beginning quite at noonday) at the time the Bluff colony began to attract attention.

The Penney family live in a plain but substantial house on the main road, a little way north
of the village, where Mr. Penney combines farming, a blacksmith's shop, and a small line of
groceries, for the benefit of his family. Up to the present time this family has jogged along
at a fairly comfortable pace, only one daughter, the youngest, Mollie, having so far escaped
from the traditional female employments of the region as to spend a season in New York, supplementing
the grammar school education by a course in elocution, with Delsarte accompaniments. When she
returned she gave her old friends to understand that she was thoroughly misunderstood by her
family; also, that she was now to be called Marie and preferably Miss, hinted that she was
soon going on a professional tour, and condescendingly agreed to give a free recital at a Sunday-school
entertainment. At this she startled the community by reciting the sleep-walking scene from
Lady Macbeth, clad in a lace-trimmed Empire nightgown, red slippers with high heels, whitened
face, wild hair, and, of course, the candlestick, with such terrible effect that the mothers
of the infant class had difficulty in getting their progeny to stay in bed in the dark for
some weeks to come. The pastor considered that, under the circumstances, she gave the words
"out damned spot" undue emphasis, while the "Watch-out Committee" of the S. C. E. failed entirely
to agree as to what gave the nightgown a decided pink tint, opinions greatly varying. Some
insisted that it was flesh, while the pastor's wife, knowing the flavour of persecution, firmly
insisted that it was merely a pink cambric slip, as was most right and proper. But her charity
was immediately discounted by Mrs. Barton, who said that likely it was pink lining, for Marie's
flesh was yellow, and not pink.

However, this event was soon forgotten in the greater interest that gathered about Fannie Penney's
return ride from town.

It seems that soon after Fannie left the town limits and was jogging along the turnpike, the
big roan horse of all work began to stumble, then grew lame forward, and finally came to a
standstill.

Fannie got out, examined his feet, soon found that not only had he cast a shoe, but in doing
so had managed to step on a nail and drive it into his frog. With the good judgment of a farrier's
daughter, she promptly unharnessed him. Looking about and seeing cows grazing in a neighbouring
pasture, she led him slowly to the side of the road, let down the bars and turned him loose,
where he immediately showed his appreciation of the situation by lying down and nibbling at
the grass within reach.

So far so good, but when Fannie began to consider the possibility of walking home, with the
chance of being picked up on the road by some one, and getting her father to come and remove
the nail, the load of groceries loomed up before her. Not only did they represent considerable
money value, country reckoning, and there was no house within half a mile either way, but some
of the articles, such as lard, were in danger of being ruined by the hot sun; so Fannie walked
along the road, searching the dust for the lost shoe, seeing no way out of her dilemma unless
some one should come by.

She did not find the shoe, but soon a cloud of dust from the town side told of an approaching
team, and she went to the shade of the only near-by tree and waited.

A moment later, the team coming up proved to be a freshly painted runabout, drawn by a fine
bay horse in trim harness, driven by the average stable boy; while beside him sat a smooth-faced,
keen-eyed man, rather under middle age, dressed in a spotless light suit, tan shoes, lilac
shirt, opalesque tie, finished above by a Panama hat pinched into many dimples.

He was evidently a man of quick action, for he saw the girl and horseless wagon at a glance,
touched the reins, stopped the horse, and jumped out before Fannie could think, taking off
his hat and saying:--

"Lady in distress, runaway horse, lucky not to have upset load--can I be of any use?" all in
one breath.

Fannie had never read Dickens, so that no comparison with the speech of Alfred Jingle arose
to make her distrustful, which was unnecessary, and the bowing figure appeared to her the perfection
of up-to-date manly elegance. Could it--yes, it must be a guest on the way to the Bluffs.

She blushingly explained the complication, feeling almost ashamed to mention her fears as to
the melting lard, it seemed so insignificant in such a presence; but he quickly reassured her
by going to the wagon, pulling it energetically under the tree, and spreading the linen lap-robe
over the goods, the effort causing streams of perspiration to alter the stately appearance
of a three-inch high collar. Next he sprang over the fence into the field, found that the nail
was too firmly wedged to be drawn from the horse's hoof with either fingers or a wagon wrench,
and returned to the road again.

"Now, may I ask where you live?" he said, dusting himself off with vigorous flips of a large
Yale blue silk handkerchief.

Fannie told him, and her name, also, and ventured to ask that, if he was going through Oaklands,
he would be good enough to tell her uncle, who kept the livery stable, to send out for her.

"I guess we can better that," he said, smiling genially. "I'm going to Oaklands to meet my
trunk and stop over a day. I'll leave the boy here with your goods, drive you in, pick up your
father, he returns with this horse, brings tools, fixes up his own, boy takes rig back to town,
your father drives goods home, see?"

Fannie saw that the arrangements were unanswerably suitable; also, that to carry them out she
must take a drive with the unknown, a drive of necessity to be sure, yet one that she could
safely call romantic, especially as, when he turned to help her into the runabout, he picked
up a horseshoe that lay in the bottom and gave it to her, saying, "It's yours; I found it half
a mile back; I never pass a horseshoe, never can tell when it'll bring luck."

Before they had gone very far her dream of his being a guest on his way to the Bluffs was shattered
by his saying: "I've got the advantage of you--know your name, you don't know mine. That's
not fair. 'Aim to be fair' 's my motto, even if I don't chance to hit it," and he pulled out
a bulky wallet and held it toward her with one hand, that she might help herself to one of
the cards with which it was filled.

Her hand touched his; she blushed so that her freckles were veiled for the moment as she read,
half aloud: "L. Middleton--with Frank Brothers. Dealers in first-class canned goods," the New
York address being in the corner. The feeling of disappointment only lasted for a moment, for
was not a travelling man, as the drummer is always called in country towns, a person of experience
and knowledge of the world, as well as being not infrequently shrouded in mystery? As she pondered
on the card, wondering if she dared put it in her pocket, he said in a matter-of-fact way,
again extending the wallet: "Don't hesitate, take the deck, may come handy, father like to
keep goods in stock some time. That's my regular; carry a side line too, perfumes and an A1
hair restorer. Got all my samples at Oaklands depot. You mind stopping there on the way? Want
to get fresh collar."

No, of course Fannie would not mind; this last request fixed her companion firmly in her esteem.
Any other man of her acquaintance would have removed his collar and proceeded without one,
never giving the matter a thought; in fact, she had been momentarily expecting that this would
happen. Now she would have the bliss of taking him home in all the perfection of his toilet
as she first beheld him.

From that moment she grew more conversational, and his utterance became less jerky, until,
when they finally drove up back of the long red brick railway station at Oaklands, a little
before noon, she had not only given him a synopsis of local history, but was, in her excitement,
vainly trying to recollect what day of the week it was, so that she might judge of the dinner
probabilities at home, also if it would be safe to ask him to stay. Fortunately remembering
that she saw her father beheading chickens the night before, which guaranteed a substantial
meal, she decided it was an absolute duty.

As L. Middleton emerged from the baggage room in a fresh collar, even higher than the other,
he threw an ornamental bottle of violet water into Fannie's lap to keep company with the horseshoe.
Immediately Hope arose at the combination, and Settled under the left folds of Fannie's pink
shirt waist; for Middleton seems a distinguished name to one who has been called Penney for
twenty-eight years, and romance had never died in the heart under the pink waist for the reason
that it was only at this moment being born.

On arriving at home, Fate continued to prove kind. Mrs. Penney was inspired to ask the guest
to "stop to dinner," without any hints or gesticulations being necessary, which might have
marred the first impression. Not only did the chickens appear at the table, where no canned
food was present, but there was a deep cherry pie as well, which was eaten with peculiar relish
by the commercial traveller, accustomed to the awful fare of New England country hotels, where
he was often obliged to use his own samples to fill gaps. He gazed about at the comfortable
kitchen, and won Mamma Penney by praising the food and saying that he was raised on a farm.
Father Penney took a hasty bite in the buttery, and soon disappeared to rescue his goods from
the highway. He was always considered something of a drawback to the matrimonial prospects
of his daughters; for, as his nose indicated, he had a firm, not to say combative, disposition,
and frequently insisted upon having not only the last but the first word upon every subject,
so that Fannie regarded his going in the light of a special providence.

After dinner the three other Penney sisters all tried their best to be agreeable, Marie donning
a clinging blue gown and walking up and down the piazza watering plants at this unusual hour
of the day for his particular benefit, a performance which caused L. Middleton to ask, "Say,
did you ever do a vaudeville turn?" And Marie, not knowing whether to take the remark as a
criticism or a compliment, preferred to take the latter view and answer in languid tones,--

"No, but I have acted, and I've been seriously advised to go on the stage."

In the middle of the afternoon, the load of groceries having arrived safely, Fannie's "hero"
took his leave, Papa Penney driving him to the village inn, where he was to unpack his samples.

For a while L. Middleton was a standard topic of conversation among the girls. They wondered
for what L. stood. Fannie guessed Louis, Marie spitefully suggested that it might be Lucifer,
and that was why he didn't spell it out. Then as he seemed about fading from the horizon, he
reappeared suddenly one crisp October morning, just starting on his eastern fall route, he
said, and invited Fanny to go to the County Fair.

Again a period of silence followed. The sisters remarked that most travelling men were swindlers,
etc., but Fannie persistently put violet water on the handkerchief that she tucked under her
pillow every night, until, as winter set in, the supply failed.

Then an idea came to her, she took the horseshoe from where it had been hanging over her door,
covered its dinginess with two coats of gold paint, cut the legend, "Sweet Violets," together
with the embossed flowers, from the label on the perfume bottle, and pasted them on the horseshoe,
which she further ornamented with an enormous ribbon bow, and despatched it secretly to L.
Middleton by express a few days before Christmas.

At New Year's a box arrived for Fannie. It contained a gold pin in the shape of a horseshoe,
in addition to a large, heart-shaped candy box filled with such chocolates that each was as
a foretaste of celestial bliss to Fannie, who now thought she might fairly assume airs of importance.

Half a dozen letters went rapidly back and forth, and then the proposal bounded along as unexpectedly
as every other detail of the courtship. There was very little sentiment of expression about
it, but he was in earnest and gave references as to his respectability, etc., much as if he
were applying for a business position, and ended by asking her at which end of his route she
preferred to live, New York, or Portland, Maine, and if in New York, would she prefer Brooklyn
or Harlem?

Fannie quickly decided upon Harlem, for, as Marie said, "There one only need give the street
name and number, while very few people yet realize that Brooklyn really is in New York."

This important matter settled, the Penney girls arose in their might upon the wings of ambition.
There should be a church wedding.

Now the Penneys were, as all their forbears had been, Congregationalists; but that church had
no middle aisle, besides, as there was no giving away of the bride in the service, there was
little chance for pomp and ceremony. It was discovered that the groom's parents had been Episcopalians,
and though he was liberal to the degree of indifference upon such matters, it was decided that
to have the wedding in St. Peter's would be a delicate compliment to him.

All the spring the village dressmaker has been at work upon the gowns of bride and of bridesmaids,
of whom there are to be six, and now the cards are out and the groom's name also, the L at
the last moment having been found to stand for Liberty. If they had consulted the groom, he
would have decried all fuss, for Fannie's chief attraction was that he thought her an unspoiled,
simple-minded country girl.

The hour was originally set for the morning, but as Fannie saw in her fashion paper that freckled
people often developed a peculiarly charming complexion when seen by lamplight, the time was
changed to eight at night, in spite of the complications it caused.

A week before the invitations were issued Fannie came to see me and after some preamble said:
"Mrs. Evan, I want my wedding to be good form, and I'd like to do the swell thing all through.
Now the Parlour Journal says that the front pews that are divided off by a white ribbon should
be for the bride's folks on one side of the aisle and the groom's on the other. Mr. Middleton
hasn't any people near by enough to come, so I thought I'd have the Bluff folks sit on that side."

"The Bluff people?" I queried, in amazement. "You surely aren't going to invite them? Do you
know any of them?"

"Well, not intimately, but Mrs. Ponsonby has been to the house for eggs, and Mrs. Latham's
horse dropped a shoe last week and father set it, and the Vanderveer boy's pony ran away into
our front yard the other day, so I don't feel as if they were strangers and to be left out.
Oh, Mrs. Evan, if they'd only come and wear some of their fine clothes to light up the church,
it would be in the papers, the Bee and the Week's News over town maybe, and give me such a
start! For you know I'm to live in New York, and as I've never left home before, it would be
so pleasant to know somebody there!"

I almost made up my mind to try to put things before her in their true light, and save her
from disappointment, but then I realized that I was too near her own age. Ah, if Lavinia Dorman
had only been here that day she could possibly have advised Fannie without giving offence.

       *       *       *       *       *

May 16th. The wedding is over. Shall I ever forget it? The rain and cool weather of the past
ten days kept back the apple blossoms, so that the supply for decorating the church was poor
and the blossoms themselves only half open and water-soaked. Mrs. Jenks-Smith, who always hears
everything, knowing of the dilemma, in the goodness of her heart sent some baskets of hothouse
flowers, but the girls and men who were decorating did not know how to handle them effectively,
for Fannie, still clinging to sentiment, had gilded nearly a barrel of old horseshoes, which
were tied with white ribbon to every available place, being especially prominent on the doors
of the reserved pews.

Late in the afternoon a fine mist set in with clouds of fog, which, if it got into the church,
I knew would completely conceal the glimmer of the oil lamps. It seems that Papa Penney was
not told until an hour before the ceremony that he was to walk up the aisle with the bride
on his arm and give her away. This he flatly refused to do. He considered it enough of an affliction
to have the wedding in church at all, and it was not until his wife had given her first exhibition
of fainting, and Fannie had cried her eyes red, that he apparently yielded.

We arrived at the church at about ten minutes to eight, father and Evan having been persuaded
to come in recognition of good neighbourhood feeling. The back part of the church was well
filled, but the space above the ribbon was painfully empty. The glimmering lamps did little
more than reveal the gloom, and the horseshoes gave a strange racing-stable effect.

We tried to spread ourselves out as much as possible to fill up, and presently the Ponsonby
girls entered with some friends, seemingly astonished at being seated within the barrier, for
they had never seen their cards of invitation, and had come as a sort of lark to kill time
on a wet evening.

The ushers wandered dismally up and down, stretching their hands nervously as if unused to
gloves. Presently they fell back, and the organ, in the hands of an amateur performer and an
inadequate blower, began to chirp and hoot merrily, by which we knew the bridal party was about
to appear.

The ushers came first, divided, and disappeared successfully in the shadows, on either side
of the chancel steps. A long wait and then Marie Penney followed, walking alone, as maid of
honour; she had insisted upon having plenty of room, as she said so few people walked well
that they spoiled her gait. Next came the six bridesmaids on a gallop, then Papa Penney and
the bride. He walked along at a jog trot, and he looked furtively about as if for a loophole
of escape. As for poor Mrs. Penney, instead of being seated in the front pew before the procession
entered, she was entirely forgotten in the excitement, and stood trembling near the door, until
some one drew her into a seat in neighbourly sympathy.

The clergyman stood waiting, the bridesmaids grouped themselves behind papa, so that there
was no retreat, but where was the groom and the best man? One, two, three minutes passed, but
no sign. He had been directed to the vestry door as the bridal party drove up. Could he suddenly
have changed his mind, and disappeared?

The silence was awful, the Ponsonby girls giggled aloud, and finally got into such gales of
laughter that I was ashamed. The organ had dropped into the customary groaning undertone that
is meant, I suppose, to give courage to the nervous and weak-voiced during the responses.

       *       *       *       *       *

Outside the church, in the rear, two men in evening dress might have been seen blundering about
in the dark, vainly trying to find an open door, for besides the door to the vestry there were
three others close together, one opening into the little chantry, one the Sunday-school room,
and one into the cellar. They battered and pulled and beat to no purpose, until a mighty pound
forced one in, and the two men found themselves flying down a flight of steps, and landing
in a heap of coal.

Dazed, and not a little bruised, the groom struck a match, and looked about; the best man had
sprained his ankle, and said so in language unbefitting the location, but Liberty Middleton
arose superior to the coal. Judging by the music that the ceremony had begun, he told his crippled
friend to sit still until he came back for him, and, by lighting a series of wax matches, found
his way back to the front door of the church, and strode up the aisle dishevelled, and with
a smutty forehead, just as Papa Penney had succeeded in breaking through the bridesmaids, dragging
Fannie with him. A sigh of relief arose. The couple stepped forward and the ceremony began.
When, however, the giving away time came, it was found that Papa Penney had retreated to a
pew, from which he could not be dislodged. Another hitch was only averted by the groom turning
pleasantly toward his father-in-law, and saying, with a wave of his hand, "It's all right,
don't trouble to move; you said 'I do,' I think; the Parson understands." The ceremony was
ended without further complication. When Fannie walked out upon the arm of the self-possessed
Liberty, I thought that the travelling man had the makings of a hero in him after all. It afterward
transpired that the hapless best man, left in the coal cellar, and not missed until the party
was halfway home, had only wrenched his ankle, and made his escape to the village tavern for
consolation, proving that even commercial travellers may be upset by a fashionable wedding
ceremony.

THE WHIRL BEGINS

May 30. The People of the Whirlpool have come to the Bluffs, and the swirl and spray has, in
a measure, followed them. I had well-nigh written, "are settled at the Bluffs," but the Whirlpoolers
are perpetual migrants, unlike the feathered birds of passage never absolutely settling anywhere
even for the nesting season, sometimes even taking to the water by preference, at the time,
of all others, when home is most loved and cherished by the "comfortably poor."

The houses, nominally closed since the holidays, have been reopened, one by one, ever since
the general return from the south in April, after which season, Mrs. Jenks-Smith assures me,
it is bad form to be seen in New York on Sunday.

This fiat, however, does not prevent members of almost every family from spending several days
a week in the city, thus protecting themselves against the possible monotony of home living
by lunching and dining, either singly or in informal groups, at the public restaurants.

Father has always held the theory that ladies should dress inconspicuously in the public streets
and hostelries, and for a woman to do otherwise, he considered, was to prove that she had no
claim upon gentility. Evan used to go so far as to say that the only people who display their
fine clothes in hotels are those who have no homes in which to wear them.

Dear, innocent provincials, the Whirlpoolers have changed all that, and given the custom their
hall mark that stamps it vogue. In fact, in glancing at the papers, by the light of our Bluff
Colony, which, after all, is but a single current of the pool that whirls in the shape of the
letter S, it seems to me that a new field has been opened for the society journalist--the reporting
of the gowns worn at the restaurants in the "between seasons."

One evening, a few weeks ago, Evan and I went, by request, to one of the most celebrated of
these resorts to call upon some friends of his, a bride and groom, then passing through the
city. We were directed where to find them in the corridor--midway would have been a better
term. We found them, and many others beside!

"Where do these people come from?" I whispered to Evan, looking down the row of women of all
ages and, if expression may indicate, all grades, who, dressed and undressed in lavish opulence,
were lolling about, much as if expecting a call to go upon the stage and take part in some
spectacle, but that the clothes and jewels were too magnificent to be stage properties.

"Brewers' wives from the west, and unknown quantities; people who come to New York to see and
be seen," he answered carelessly; but almost as he spoke his words were checked by the entrance
of an equally gorgeous group, composed of those who Lavinia Dorman had assured us were among
the most conservative of our new neighbours, all talking aloud, as if to an audience, as they
literally swept into the dining room, where Mrs. Center was already seated. To be sure, the
clothes, in their cases, were worn with a difference,--the ease of habit,--but to all outward
appearance the distinction began and ended there. Ah me! to think of having such things cross
the horizon in May, when, unless one is forced to be miserable, one must be inexpressibly happy.

I have been working all the month in my garden, as of old, or trying to, at least, but upon
the principle that no member of a community can either live or die wholly to, or by, himself,
I here missed the untrammelled liberty of yore. Not that I care if I am detected collarless,
in a brown holland apron, with earthy fingers, and sometimes even a smutty nose, but the Whirlpoolers,
unable to regard the work as serious, do not hesitate to interrupt, if nothing more.

Imagine the assurance of the twenty-two-year-old Ponsonby girl, who came dashing up all of
a fume last Saturday morning, when I was comfortably seated on the old tea tray, transplanting
a flat of my best ostrich plume asters, and begging me, her mother being away, to chaperon
her to a ball game, in a town not far off up the railroad, with harmless, pink-eyed Teddy Tice,
one of her brother's college mates. It seems that if she could have driven up and taken a groom
it would have been good form, but there was some complication about the horses, and to go by
rail unchaperoned, even though surrounded by a earful of people, was not to be thought of.
I pointed to the asters that must be set out and covered before the sun was high, but she couldn't
understand, and went off in a huff.

What a disagreeable word chaperon is at best, and what a thankless vocation the unlisted, active,
and very irregular verb 'to chaperon' implies. I quite agree with Johnson, who denounced the
term as affected, for certainly its application is, though Lavinia Dorman says it is the natural
effect of a definite cause, and that it is quite necessary from the point of view of the quarter
where it most obtains.

Monday morning I was again interrupted in my garden operations by a Whirlpooler, but the reason
was quite different. The twins have gardens of their own, which are as individual and distinctive
as their two selves. Richard delights in straight rows, well patted down between, and treats
the small seeds that he plants with a sort of paternal patience. Ian disdains any seed smaller
than a nasturtium or bean, whose growth is soon apparent, and has collected a motley assortment
of bulbs, roots, and plants, without regard to size or season, and bordered his patch with
onion sets for Corney Delaney's express benefit, the goat having a Gallic taste for highly
flavoured morsels. Both boys are fairly patient with their own gardening operations, but their
joy is to "help" me by handing tools, watering plants, and squirting insecticides, in my society
and under my direction.

Of course I could do it all much quicker by myself, and it has hampered me this spring, for
last season they were too irresponsible to more than play work a few minutes at a time.

Now I have come to the conclusion that it is their right to learn by helping me, and that it
is the denial of companionship, either from selfishness or some absurd educational theory,
that weakens the force of home ties later on.

I have been frequently lectured by those older, but more especially "new mothers" younger than
I, about staying with the boys at bedtime until they grow drowsy. "The baby is put to bed,
and if he cries I pay no attention; it is only temper, not pain, for he stops the minute I
speak to him," they say. I feel the blood rush to my face and the sting to my tongue always
when I hear this.

Not pain, not temper, but the unconscious yearning for companionship, for mother-love, is oftener
the motive of the pitiful cry. Why should it be denied? The mother bird broods her young in
the nest at twilight, and the father bird sings a lullaby to both. The kittens luxuriously
sup themselves to sleep with the warm mother flesh responding to their seeking paws. In wild
life I know not an animal who does not in some way soothe her young to sleep. Why should the
human child, the son of man, be forced to live without the dream memories that linger about
happy sleeping times? What can the vaunted discipline give to replace them? It is then, as
they grow, and speech forms on their lips, that little confessions come out and wrongs are
naturally righted through confidence, before they can sprout and grow.

I was not quite five when I last watched mother sowing her flower seeds, and yet I remember
to this day the way in which she did it, and so when it came time to give my bed of summer
roses its first bath of whale oil, soap, and water, and the boys gave whoops of joy when they
saw Bertel wheel out the tub and I appeared with the shining brass syringe, I resolved to let
them have the questionable delight of administering the shower bath, even if it took all day.

I have appropriated a long strip of rich, deep soil for these tender roses, quite away from
the formal garden and across the path from the new strawberry bed, which by the necessity of
rotation has worked its way from the vegetable garden to the open spot under the bank wall
by the stable where the hotbeds congregate. This wall breaks the sweep of the wind, and so
both our tender roses and strawberries are of the earliest, the fruit already being well set
and large.

It was the middle of the morning. The work was progressing finely, without more than the usual
amount of slop and misdirected effort, when a violent tooting from the direction of the highway
caused me to stop, and Ian dropped the squirter that I had newly filled for his turn, upon
the grass border, while he and Richard scurried toward the gateway to see what was the matter,
for the sound was like the screech of an automobile horn in distress. It was!

A streak of dark red and a glitter of brass flashed in between the gate posts, grazing them,
and barely escaping an upset, and then came plunging toward me. I screamed to the boys, who
seemed to me directly in the path of the Thing, which in another moment I recognized as an
automobile of the battering-ram variety, belonging to Harvey Somers, Gwendolen Burton's fiancé,
which for the past week had been the terror of father's steady old gray horses, owing to its
constitutional eccentricities.

Mr. Somers was handling it single-handed, and though he was coming at a reckless speed, I expected
that he would swing back of the house and come to one of the dramatic sudden stops, on the
verge of an accident, for which he is famous. So he did, but not on the driveway!

The Thing gave a lurch and veered toward the barn, spitting like a cageful of tiger cats. Somers
was pushing the lever and gripping the brake with all his athletic might, but to no purpose.
The children, who, wild with excitement, had by this time sought the safety of the open barn
door, seemed a second time to be in the monster's path.

Another lurch! Surely man and machine would be dashed to bits against the substantial stable wall!

Then the Thing changed its course, and showing a ray of flustered intelligence, made a mighty
leap off the bank wall and landed hub deep in the soft, friable soil of the new strawberry
bed, where, after one convulsive effort, some part of its anatomy blew up with the triple report
of a rapid-fire gun, and after having relieved itself of a cloud of steam, it settled down
peacefully, as if a strawberry bed was the place of all others it preferred for a noonday nap.

Harvey Somers was shot with a left-handed twirl directly into one of the hotbed frames, from
which the sash was pushed back, and landed in a doubled-up position, amid a tearing sound and
the crash of broken glass. Meanwhile, the boys, frightened at the cloud of steam, yelled "Fire!"
at the top of their lungs.

As I flew to help him, I could for the instant think of nothing but the Lizard Bill's assisted
progress up the chimney and into the cucumber frame, but as a rather faint voice said, "Not
you; kindly call the Doctor," my mirth changed to alarm, which was not lessened when Timothy
Saunders, hearing the uproar and the cry of fire, arriving too late to grasp the situation
with his slow Scotch brain, and seeing me leaning over the plant frame, picked up the squirt
and deluged the unfortunate man with whale-oil spray!

Coughing and choking, Mr. Somers finally sat up, but did not offer to do more, wiped his eyes,
and said to me in most delightful and courteous tones, "Would you be so good as to allow your
man to bring me either a bath robe or a mackintosh?"

I was at once relieved, for I knew that the lacerations were of trousers and not flesh, and
at the same time I saw that the crash of glass was caused merely by the toppling backward of
the sash, also that all my young heliotrope plants that were in the frame where the chauffeur
reposed were hopelessly ruined.

Timothy brought out Evan's bath gown, and in a few moments Mr. Somers was himself again, and
after surveying the scene of the disaster, he approached me with a charming bow, and drawing
a crumpled note from his pocket said:--

"I promised Bertie Chatterton to give you this invitation for his studio tea to-morrow, in
person, and I fear that I have rather overshot my promise. Best way to get that brute up will
be from the bank wall,--will damage your fruit less. I will have a derrick sent up to-morrow,
or if possible this afternoon. I'm awfully sorry, Mrs. Evan, but I think you'll bear me witness
that the accident was quite out of my control. May I beg the favour of a trap home? I'm a trifle
shaken up, that's all." And as if the accident were an everyday affair, he departed without
fuss and having steadied my nerves by his entire self-control.

As I stood by the gateway pondering upon the matter and the easy manners of this Whirlpooler,
Mrs. Jenks-Smith drove past. She had met Mr. Somers, and as her curiosity was piqued by his
strange attire, she stopped to see if I could furnish a clew. She says, by the way, that he
is not a New Yorker, but from Boston, and that his father is an English Honourable and his
mother a Frenchwoman.

A gang of men with a sort of wrecking machine hired from the railroad company removed the Thing
next day, and towed it off, but of course the strawberries were half ruined; next a man from
the florist's in town came with directions to repair all damage to turf and replace the smashed
plants. Yet that is not all--the sense of peace and protection that I had when working in my
garden has had a shock. In spite of the inhospitable air it gives the place, I think we must
keep the gates closed.

Why was Jenks-Smith inspired to start a land-boom here and fate allowed to make fashion smile
on it, when we were so uneventfully happy, so twinfully content?

Martin Cortright arrived on Wednesday, and is safely ensconced with Martha and Timothy Saunders,
who could give him the couple of plainly furnished rooms he desired, and breakfast at any hour.
For a man of no hours (which usually means he never breakfasts before nine) to forgather cheerfully
at a commuter's table at 7:15 A.M. is a trial to him, and a second breakfast is apt to cause
a cloud in Madam C.'s domestic horizon. Therefore, father allowed Martin to do as he suggested,
live at the farm cottage and work here in the library or attic den, as suits his convenience.
In this way he feels quite independent, has motive for exercise in walking to and fro, and
as he is always welcome to dine with us, can mix his portion of solitude and society in the
exact proportion of his taste, even as his well-shaped fingers carefully blend the tobacco
for his outdoor pipe.

Dear old fellow, he seems so happy and bubbling over with good temper at having overstepped
the tyranny of habit, that I shall almost expect to see his gray hairs turn brown again as
the wintry pelt of the weasel does in spring.

If the Vanderveer boy is diagnosed as a case of "suppressed boyhood," then Martin Cortright's
only ailment should be dubbed "suppressed youth!"

He was to have come earlier in the month, but a singular circumstance prevented. The old-time
gentlewoman, at whose house in Irving Place he has had his apartments so long that a change
seemed impossible, died, and he was obliged not only to move, but put his precious belongings
in storage until he can place himself suitably once more. So that his plan of coming here bridges
the break, and seems quite providential.

He and father walk up and down the garden together after dinner, smoking and chatting, and
it does me good to see dear daddy with one of his old-time friends. I think I am only now realizing
what he, with his sociable disposition, gave up in all those years before Evan came, that I
should not be alone, and that he might be all in all to me.

It was quite cool yesterday. We had hearth fires all through the house, and Martin, rearranging
some reference books for his own convenience in the little room that is an annex to father's
library, wore his skull cap and Chinese silk dressing gown, which gave him an antique air quite
at variance with his clear skin and eyes.

Lavinia Dorman had been due all the week, but worry with the workmen who are building in the
rear of her house detained her, and she telegraphed me that she would take the morning express,
and asked me to meet her over in town. So I drove in myself, dropping father at the hospital
on the way, but on reaching the station the train brought me no passenger.

I returned home, hoping to be in time for our way train, thinking I had mistaken her message,
and missed it; but the postmistress,--for every strange face is noticed in town,--told me that
the lady who visited me two weeks ago walked up from the ten o'clock train; that she had a
new bonnet and "moved right spry," and asked if she was a relative of mine. "An aunt, maybe,
and was the pleasant new gentleman an uncle, and did he write a newspaper? She thought maybe
he did because he was so particular about his mail." I said something about their being adopted
relations, and hurried home.

The boys were industriously digging dandelions on the side lawn. I inconsistently let the dear,
cheery flowers grow and bloom their fill in the early season, when they lie close to the sward,
but when they begin to stretch awkward, rubbery necks, and gape about as if to see where they
might best shake out their seed puffs, they must be routed. Do it as thoroughly as possible,
enough always remain to repay my cruelty with a shower of golden coin the next spring. Bertel
spends all his spare time on the other bits of grass, but the side lawn is the boys' plunder,
where, by patiently working each day at grubbing out the roots at twenty-five cents a hundred,
they expect, before the dandelion season is over, to amass wealth enough to buy an alluring
red goat harness trimmed with bells that is on exhibition at the harness shop in town, for
Corney Delaney. Yes, they said, Aunt Lavinia had just come, but she said they need not stop,
for she could go in by herself.

There was no one in the hall, sitting room, den, or upstairs, neither had Effie seen any person
enter. Thinking I heard voices in the direction of father's office, I went there and through
to the library "annex," where an unexpected picture met my gaze. Martin Cortright, the precise,
in stocking feet, skull cap, and dressing gown, perched on top of the step-ladder, was clutching
a book in one hand, within the other he held Miss Lavinia's slender fingers in greeting, while
his face had a curious expression of surprise, pleasure, and a wild desire to regain his slippers
that were down on the floor, a combination that made him look extremely foolish as well as "pudgy."

Up to that moment, Miss Lavinia, who cannot distinguish a face three feet away without her
lorgnette, thought she was speaking to father. Under cover of our mutual hilarity, I led her
back to a seat in the study, so that Martin might recover his wits, coat, and slippers at the
same time, for Miss Lavinia had stumbled over the latter and sent them coasting in different
directions.

Yes, the postmistress was right, Lavinia Dorman had a new bonnet. Not the customary conservative
but monotonous upholstered affair of jet and lace, but a handful of pink roses in a tulle nest,
held on by wisps of tulle instead of ribbons.

"Hortense, who has made bonnets for years, said this was more appropriate for the country,
and would show dirt less than black,--and even went so far as to suggest omitting the strings
altogether," she said in rather flurried tones, as a few moments later we went upstairs, and
I removed the pins that held the confection in place, and commented upon its prettiness.

       *       *       *       *       *

Martin Cortright stayed to dinner, and afterward he, Miss Lavinia, father, and Evan sat down
to a "real old-fashioned," serious game of whist! Of all things, to the fifth wheel, who is
out of it, would not be in if she could, cannot learn, and prefers jackstraws to card games
of any sort, an evening of serious whist is the most aggravating. They were too well matched
to even enliven matters by squabbling or casting venomous glances at each other. Evan played
with Martin Cortright, whose system he was absorbed in mastering, and he never spoke a word,
and barely looked up. This, too, when he had been away for several days on a business trip.
It was moonlight, and I wanted him to see the new iris that were in bloom along the wild walk,
dilate upon the game of leap-frog that the automobile played, and--well--there is a great deal
to say when Evan has been away that cannot be thought of indoors or be spoken hurriedly in
the concise, compact, public terms in which one orders a meal. Conversation is only in part
made of words, its subtilties are largely composed of touch and silence.

I myself, being wholly responsible for the present whist combination, of course could say nothing
except to myself and the moon. What a hoard of personal reminiscences and heart to heart confessions
the simpering old thing must have stored away behind her placid countenance. It is a wonder
that no enterprising journal has syndicated her memoirs by wireless telegraphy for the exclusive
use of their Sunday issue.

I resolved that I must wait awhile, and then if this silence lasted many evenings, I must hunt
up a game of cards that takes only two. How could I get out of the room without appearing to
be in a huff or bored? Ah! a wordless excuse; a slight noise upstairs. Ian sometimes walks
in his sleep. I go up and sit in my window and look out through the diamond panes at the garden.
Ian stirs and mutters something about a drink. I hasten to get it, and he, gripping the glass
with his teeth, swallows eagerly, with a clicking noise in his throat.

"Is your throat sore?" I ask apprehensively. He opens his eyes, realizes where he is, nestles
his head into my neck and whispers,--

"Not zactly lumpy sore, Barbara, just crusty, 'cause I made--lots of dandelion curls wif my
tongue to-day, and they're--velly--sour," and with a satisfied yawn he rolled back on his pillow,
into the funny spread-eagle attitude peculiar to himself, but Richard slept peacefully on like
a picture child, cheek on hand, and the other little dandelion-stained paw above the sheet.

(N.B.--When one's husband and father together take to serious whist of a moonlight night in
spring, twins are not only an advantage but a necessity.)

I have searched the encyclopedia for the description of an intellectual game of cards, arranged
as a duet, and found one. It is piquet! Now I can wait developments peacefully, for are there
not also in reserve chess, checkers, backgammon, and--jackstraws?

June 2. A gentle summer shower at sunset after a perfect day has filled the world with fragrance
and song, for do the birds ever sing so perfectly with such serene full-noted ecstasy as after
the rains of May and June? Or is it the clearness of the air after the rain that transmits
each note in full, prisoning nothing of its value?

To-night I am unhappy. Perhaps that is an exaggeration, and perplexed is the better word, and
it is only in pages of my social experience book that the cause can be given.

Friday was Peysey Vanderveer's eighth birthday, and it has been celebrated by a party on a
scale of magnificence that to my mind would have been suitable for the only son of royalty.

Though the invitations fortunately were only given two days in advance, Richard and Ian were
agog over the matter to the extent of muttering in their sleep, and getting up this morning
before eight, in order, if possible, to make the hour of three come quicker, and to be sure
to be ready in time.

When the invitation was brought by Mr. Vanderveer in person, he asked if Lavinia Dorman and
I would not like to come up also and see the children play, adding that I need feel no responsibility
about the boys, as he was going to be at home and give himself up to seeing that the "kids"
had a jolly time, and got into no scrapes.

We agreed that it would be amusing to go up with the children, stay a little while to be sure
that they could adapt themselves, and then leave; for if there is anything dampening to the
ardour of children at play it is a group of elders with minds divided between admiration and
correction, punctuating unwise remarks upon beauty and cleverness with "Maud, you are overheated."
"Tommy, don't! Use your handkerchief!" "Billy, your stocking is coming down!" "Reggie, you
must wait, girls should be helped first."

The boys certainly looked comfortably and humanly handsome in their white cheviot sailor suits,
loose blue ties, black stockings and pumps. They really are good-looking children. Lavinia
Dorman, who is candour itself, says so. I suppose people think that my opinion does not count,
and that I should consider them perfect if they were of the human chipmunk variety. But I am
sure I am not prejudiced, for I do not think them perfect, only well made and promising, thus
having the two first requisites of all young animals.

When we arrived at the Vanderveers a little late, owing to the fact of father's having been
obliged to use our horse for a hurry call, the party had "gathered," to use an old-fashioned
expression, and I saw that Richard and Ian were by several years the youngest of the group
of thirty or more, the others ranging from eight to thirteen or fourteen.

The house and grounds were decorated wherever decoration was possible. Though it was wholly
a daylight affair, Japanese lanterns hung by festoons of handsome ribbon from verandas, trees,
and around the new pergola, the marble columns of which, in the absence of vines, were wound
with ribbons and roofed with bright flags, to form a tent for the collation. In an arbour decorated
in a like manner, an Hungarian orchestra in uniform, much in vogue, Miss Lavinia says, for
New York dinner dances, was playing ragtime, while a dozen smart traps and road carts filled
with exquisitely dressed women lining the driveway around the sunken tennis court, indicated
that a matched game was to take place.

Yes, after every one had exchanged greetings, Miss Lavinia, meeting several friends who not
only treated her with something akin to homage, but were unfeignedly pleased to see her, the
guests divided, a dozen of the elder girls and boys going toward the tennis court, where Monty
Bell seemed to be acting as general manager. I afterward discovered that two prizes for doubles
and two for singles were to be played for, not pretty trifles suitable for children, but jewellery,
belt buckles of gold and silver, gold sleeve links, and a loving cup.

Meanwhile Mr. Vanderveer took charge of the younger group and led them through the garden to
where some young spruce trees hid the wall. Here a surprise awaited them in the shape of two
of the largest of the growing trees festooned with ribbons and laden with strange fruit in
the shape of coloured toy balloons that bobbed about and tugged at their moorings as if anxious
to escape.

On each balloon a number was painted in white. A wide ribbon was stretched barrierwise across
the walk about fifteen feet from the trees, and near it were several large baskets, one full
of bows and dart-pointed arrows, and the other heaped with expensive toys and bonbon boxes
of painted satin, for prizes, each article being numbered.

"Step up, ladies and gentlemen. Stand in line by the ribbon and take your turn at the most
unique shooting match ever seen in this county,--one at a time,--and whoever points the arrow
at anything but the balloons is ruled out," rattled Mr. Vanderveer, after the manner of a fakir
at a country fair, and beaming with pleasure. For Evan says that outside of business dealings
he has the reputation of being the most good-natured and generous of men, and that to invent
ways to lavish money upon his son and his friends is almost as keen a pleasure to him as to
promote schemes for winning it.

Mr. Vanderveer picked up a bow and dart to illustrate the game, aimed at a balloon, the arrow
glanced off, but at the second shot the balloon went pop and shrivelled away with the whistle
of escaping gas and shouts of applause from both children and their elders.

Feeling assured that my boys were quite at their ease and not likely to balk and act like wild
rabbits, as is sometimes the case with children when they find themselves among strangers,
and seeing nothing that they would be likely to fall out of or into, except a great bowl of
lemonade arranged in a bower that represented a well, we came away, Lavinia Dorman sniffing
in the spectacle like a veteran war-horse scenting powder, and enjoying the gayety, as I myself
should have done heartily if it had not been for the boys.

I was not worried about their clothes, their taking cold, or sticking the darts into their
fingers, but I was beginning to realize the responsibility of consequences. What would the
effect of this fête be upon the birthday parties of our village community, where a dish of
mottoes, a home-made frosted sponge cake, and a freezer of ice cream (possibly, but not always)
from town, eaten out-of-doors, meant bliss.

I suppose it is only the comfortably poor who have to think of consequences, the uncomfortably
rich think they can afford not to, and tired of mere possession, they must express their wealth
audibly at any cost.

       *       *       *       *       *

Richard and Ian came home about half past six, driven by Timothy Saunders, who was in a sulky
mood. When I asked him, by way of cheerful conversation, if the Vanderveer grounds did not
look pretty, and if he had heard the band (he is very fond of music), he fairly glowered at
me as he used in his bachelor days, before Martha's energetic affection had mellowed him, and
he began to jerk out texts, his dialect growing more impossible each moment, so that the only
words that I caught were "scarlet weemen--Philistines--wrath--mammon o' the unriteous," etc.,
until I seized the boys and fled into the porch, because when Timothy Saunders is wrathful,
and quotes scripture as a means of expressing it, some one must fly, and it is never Timothy.

The boys, however, were jubilant, and began at once to unwrap the various bundles they were
hugging, prizes, it seemed, for every game they played, that represented enough plunder to
deck a small Christmas tree. After these had been duly admired, with some misgivings on my
part, Ian jumped up suddenly, clapping his hand to his pocket, and coming close, so that he
could rest upon my knee, he began pulling out shining new dimes and quarters, until his hands,
moist and trembling with excitement, could hold no more, and he poured the coins into my lap.

"Count them please, Barbara, vely quick, 'cause I can't say so many," he begged, standing with
his curly head a little on one side, and his eyes flashing with eagerness.

Wondering what new form of extravagance it was, I counted, "One, two, three dollars and a half."

"Then we can go and buy the red harness for Corney to-morrow, without bothering to dig up any
more dandies, 'cause Dick's got some too," he fairly shouted. "It was all bully fun, but that
swizzle game where the marble ran round was the bestest of all, only some numbers it sat on
took the pennies and some gave them back," and he indicated something flying round in a circle
as he capered about. Ian's slightest gestures, like his father's, are very realistic, and I
turned sick as I realized the game by which the silver had been won was probably roulette!
Could it be possible? How had Mr. Vanderveer dared? No, there must be some mistake.

At that instant my attention was attracted by Richard, who, after unpacking his toys, had curled
up in a deep piazza chair, where he sat without saying a word, but looking flushed and heavy-eyed.

"Do you feel sick? Perhaps you ate too much cream, and then ran too fast. Come and let mother
feel of your hands," I said. His hands were cold and his head burning.

"It wasn't the cweam," he replied finally, as if not quite sure what was the matter, "it was
the lemonade with the bitter currant jelly in it that made the cweam and all swell up,--and
I guess it's going to spill pretty soon."

"Lemonade with bitter jelly in it?" queried father, coming out, "what sort of a mess have they
given him?" Father stooped, smelled his breath, saying, "Astringent wine of some sort, unless
my nose fails me. Did you have any, Ian?"

"Not pink, only yellow. I was all full up by then."

"When?"

"Why, when the big boys caught some of us and said we must drink pink lemonade to make us grow
quick."

Father gave me a keen glance of intelligence, and I took the boys upstairs, where Richard's
trouble soon righted itself, and, early as it was, they went quickly to sleep with the precious
money under their pillows, fatigue conquering even their excitement.

Evan came home rather late, and at dinner we talked of other things. As far back as I remember
anything, I can hear father's voice saying alike to Aunt Lot, myself, or a complaining servant,
"The family board is sacred; meals are not the time for disagreeables."

Immediately after dinner, and before I had a chance to tell Evan, Mrs. Jenks-Smith stopped
on her way home from a drive, the Whirlpoolers not dining until eight, to ask father if she
might take some friends in to see the hospital to-morrow, an appeal having been recently made
for new bedding, etc., saying: "We're going to have smashing strawberries and roses this year;
they'll come on before the crowd moves along in July, and we might as well shake up a fête
for the hospital as anything else, as we're bound to keep moving.

"Were you up at Vanderveers this afternoon? Oh, yes, to be sure, I saw you going down hill
as I drove in. Quite a chic affair for a little between-season place like this; but after all,
it's the people, not the place, that make the pace, isn't it, Miss Dorman? And a swell New
Yorker can leave a wake that'll show the way anywhere.

"You don't look happy, though, Mrs. Evan. The boys ate too much? No? Roulette a little too
high for you?

"Well, my dear, I half agree with you. I think things were a little too stiff this afternoon
for such youngsters; but Vandy is such a liberal fellow he couldn't do enough,--nor tell when
to stop,--actually lugged up half a dozen bags of new silver and dealt it to the kids in handfuls.
Harm? Why, he didn't see any, I dare say. He wasn't robbing anybody; besides, I'll bet Monty
Bell put him up to it. I know how you feel, though. I wouldn't play for money myself, if I'd
young boys; but as I haven't, it doesn't matter, and one must be amused. That's the way Mrs.
Latham jogged poor Carthy off and began the gap with her husband. Latham gambles on change,
of course, but drew the line at his house. Didn't know it? You poor innocent, you're as bad
as Sylvia herself. Why, yes, they're as good as divorced, by mutual agreement, though; he's
kept away all of two years. I expect that they will announce it any time now.

 At least that is what Miss Lavinia

which, together with Mrs. Jenks-Smith's random remarks, have inevitably set me to thinking.

I had hoped to form a pleasant friendship with Sylvia, for though I have only met her two or
three times, I feel as if I really knew her; but there will be little chance now, as they go
on to Newport the first of July, and the continual procession of house parties, for golf, tennis,
etc., at the Bluffs, even though they are called informal, necessarily stand in the way of
intimate neighbourly relations between us. Monty Bell has been dividing his week ends between
the Ponsonby, Vanderveer, and Jenks-Smith households, yet he always is in the foreground when
I have been to see Sylvia, even though I have tried to slip in between times in the morning.

I do not like this Monty Bell; he seems to be merely an eater of dinners and a cajoler of dames,
such superficial chivalry of speech as he exhibits being only one of the many expedients that
gain him the title of "socially indispensable" that the Whirlpoolers accord him.

Personally anything but attractive, he seems able to organize and control others in a most
singular way. Perhaps it is because he has a genius for taking pains and planning successful
entertainments for his friends, even to the minutest detail, and giving them the subtle distinction
of both originality and finish, without troubling their givers to think for themselves. Miss
Lavinia-says that he has the entree of the two or three very exclusive New York houses that
have never yet opened their doors to Mrs. Latham and several more aspiring Whirlpoolers, Mrs.
Jenks-Smith having penetrated the sacred precincts, only by right of having been presented
at the English Court in the last reign through the influence of her stepdaughter, who married
a poverty-stricken title.

"I don't know what it all amounts to," said the outspoken Lady of the Bluffs on her return,
"except that I'm in it now with both feet, which is little enough pay for the trouble I took
and the money Jenks-Smith put out.

"Our son-in-law? No, he's not exactly English, he's Irish, blood of the old kings, they say;
but all the good it does him is, that he can wear his hat with a feather in it, or else his
shoes, I can never remember which, in the presence of royalty, when if it wasn't for good American
money he'd have neither one or the other.

"Money? Oh yes, that's all they want of us over there; we've no cause to stick up our noses
and think it's ourselves. We know, Jenks-Smith and I, for haven't we been financial mother
and father in law to a pair of them for ten years? Jenks-Smith was smart, though; he wouldn't
give a lump sum down, but makes them an allowance, and we go over every year or so and bail
them out of some sort of a mess to boot, have the plumbing fixed up, and start the children
all over with new clothes. That's what we're doing when the papers say, 'Mr. and Mrs. Jenks-Smith,
who went to Carlsbad for the waters, are now in Ireland, being entertained in regal style by
their daughter and son-in-law at Bally-whack House.'"

Miss Lavinia says with a shiver that whoever marries Monty Bell, and it is absolutely necessary
for him to make a wealthy connection in the immediate future, will have all New York doors
open to her, and that, as Mrs. Latham is leaving no stone unturned in order to become a social
leader, a marriage between Sylvia and Mr. Bell would secure her the complete prestige necessary
to her ambition, while rearranged families are so common and often the results of such trivial
causes, that the fact of the man's having a lovely wife and two children living abroad does
not militate against him in the least. It all seems ghastly, this living life as if it was
a race track, where to reach the social goal is the only thought, no matter how, or over or
through what wreckage, or in what company the race is to be won.

Since her return Sylvia has looked pale and seemed less buoyant. She is much disappointed because
her plan of going to Rockcliffe to see her class graduate cannot be carried out. Miss Lavinia
had promised to go with her, and the poor child was looking forward to a week of girlish pleasure
among the friends with whom she had spent two years, when, lo and behold! the rose and strawberry
festival, that the Lady of the Bluffs had stirred up for the benefit of the hospital, assumed
such huge proportions that the entire colony became involved, and the dates conflicting, it
was impossible for Sylvia to leave home without entirely tipping over her mother's plans.

The places on the north side of the Bluff road are to be thrown open, grand-chain fashion,
each contributing something by way of entertainment, games, a merry-go-round brought with great
expense from the city, fortune telling, a miniature show of pet animals, and an amateur circus,
being a few of the many attractions offered.

The spectators are to pay a fee and enter by the Ponsonbys', the first place on the south,
and gradually work their way up to the Jenks-Smiths', where the rose garden and an elaborate
refreshment booth will be reached. The Latham garden is too new to make any showing, but Mrs.
Latham, who has been much in New York of late, promises something novel in the way of a tea
room in her great reception hall, while Mrs. Jenks-Smith insisted that Sylvia should have charge
of her rose booth, saying: "Your name's suitable for the business, you'll look well in a simple
hat and baggy mull gown, such as artists always want to put on the people they paint, and I
must positively have some one who'll stay by me and see that things are not torn to bits, for
all the rest of the girls will slide off with the first pair of trousers that comes along.
Anyway, you don't match the little Ponsonby and Chatfield minxes that your mother has chosen
for her six Geisha girls, for you are a head taller than the bunch."

Nothing is talked of now but this fête. Of course it will help the hospital, even though ten
times the amount is being spent upon the preparation than any sum that can possibly be made
for the charity; but it pleases the people to spend. Father says that the Whirlpoolers are
already bored; that they have used up the place, for the time being, and if it were not for
this festival, the Bluffs would be deserted for Newport and Long Island long before July.

Social ambition has even infected our rector's jolly little wife, who has never felt able or
called upon to entertain in any but the most informal way. After hearing the report of a clerical
luncheon in New York, where the clergyman sat at the foot of his own table with a miniature
shepherd's crook before him, and the favour beside the plate of each female guest consisted
of a woolly lamb, she, not to be outdone, immediately imperilled the possibility of a new winter
gown by inviting all the non-resident members of the congregation to lunch, and serving the
ice cream in a toy Noah's Ark, while the animals from it were grouped about a large dish of
water, to form an appropriate decoration in the centre of the table, and sugar doves at each
plate held leaves in their mouths, upon which the name of the guest was neatly pricked with a pin.

Lavinia Dorman has decided to stay with me and do without her maid, rather than take a cottage,
or board, for we find that we do not wear on each other in the least. We never plan for one
another, or interfere in any way, and each takes it for granted that if the other desires assistance
of any sort, she will ask for it.

Miss Lavinia pokes about the garden at her own sweet will. I gather the flowers,--I could not
give that up to any one,--and she takes charge of arranging them in the house. She is very
fond of doing fancy work, I am not, so that her offer to re-cover the sofa cushions in den,
study, and library comes in the light of a household benefaction.

Besides this, she has a very good effect upon the boys, and without being at all fussy, she
is instilling their absorbent minds quite unconsciously with some little bits of the quaint
good breeding of other days that they will never forget. They love to go to town with her,
one of her first stipulations being that if I chose to include her in some of our long drives,
well and good, otherwise she wished the liberty of telephoning the stable for horse and man,
whenever she pleased, without my troubling myself about her movements.

Meanwhile, I really think that this living in the midst of a family without losing her independence
is making Lavinia Dorman grow backwards toward youth. She has bought an outing hat without
strings, trimmed with fluffy white, she takes her work out under the trees in a basket, and
has given up tying her head in a thin and a thick veil every time she drives out. If she could
learn to sit comfortably back and lounge a trifle, and if a friendly magpie would only chance
along and steal her stock of fronts, for a nest, so that she would be obliged to show her own
lovely hair that shades like oxidized silver, the transformation would be complete.

Martin Cortright also is developing mental energy. He always had considerable physical vim,
as I found the Sunday after he first came, when he accompanied Evan upon one of his long walks,
and was not used up by it. He has stopped fumbling with reference books and shuffling bits
of paper by the hour, and writes industriously every day by the west window of the attic, where
he can refresh himself by looking out of the window at the garden, or across at the passers
on the highway. I was afraid that he might wish to read the results nightly to either father
or Evan, but no, he keeps them safely under lock and key in a great teacher's desk that he
bought second hand over in town. He stays to dine with us two or three nights a week, but he
has grown flexible, and our meals are very merry ones. Laugh softly to yourself, Experience
Book, and flutter your leaves just a bit as I write, that of their own volition, Miss Lavinia
and Martin have drifted from whist to piquet, as by natural transition, and Evan is free for
garden saunterings once more.

June 25. Yesterday was the day of the festival, and it was neither sultry, foggy, nor brought
to a sudden stop by a thunder shower, as so often happens at this season.

By half past two in the afternoon the country teams could be seen winding Bluff ward by all
the various roads, and before three, the hour at which the gates were to be opened, every available
hitching place was occupied, and the line of vehicles extended well up one of the back lanes
that was bounded by a convenient rail fence.

Horace Bradford arrived home at Pine Ridge night before last. He had expected to see Sylvia
and Miss Lavinia at Rockcliffe. Missing them, and not knowing the cause of their change of
plan, very naturally his first thought was to drive down to Oak-lands and make a double call.
On taking up the local paper he saw the announcement of the rose festival set forth in ornamental
type, which gave him a key to the situation, so that the substantial, if not ornamental, farm
buggy, drawn by a young horse with plenty of free-gaited country go but no "manners," was one
of the first to reach the Bluffs, Horace innocently hoping to have a few moments with Sylvia
before the festivities began. He therefore inquired his way to the Latham house direct, instead
of going into the fair grounds by way of the Ponsonbys', and encountered Perkins, Potts, and
Parker, who were on guard at the door, as well as two footmen who stood by the steps with straw
wheel guards ready to assist people from their traps, and two grooms in silk-sleeved buff jackets,
who waited to take charge of the horses of the men who were expected to ride over from a neighbouring
social settlement.

The outdoor group seemed to be in doubt how to proceed. Bradford had all the ease of bearing
that they instinctively felt belonged to a gentleman, but his turnout was beyond the pale,
and the grooms hesitated to give it the shelter of the perfectly equipped stable.

Perkins, however, did not hesitate, and before Bradford could open his lips, came through the
doors that were fastened wide open, and, with a wave of his hand said, in freezing tones, "You've
come in the wrong way; the entrance gate and ticket booth is below, as the sign shows."

"I wish to see Miss Latham," said Bradford, handing his card, and at the same time with difficulty
suppressing a violent desire to knock the man down.

"Not at home," replied immovable Perkins, vouchsafing no further information.

"Then take my card to Mrs. Latham," thundered Bradford, nettled by his slip in not asking for
both at the first instance, and; as the man still hesitated, he strode past him through the
porch and into the hall.

As Perkins disappeared through one of the many doorways, Bradford stood still for a moment
before his eyes focussed to the change of light. The pillars of the hall that supported the
balcony corridor of the second story were wreathed with light green vines, delicate green draperies
screened the windows, the pale light coming from many Japanese lanterns and exquisitely shaded
bronze lamps rather than outside. Half a dozen little arbours were formed by large Japanese
umbrellas, under which tea tables were placed, and the sweet air of the summer afternoon was
changed and made suffocatingly heavy by burning incense.

Of course all this paraphernalia belonged to the festival, and yet Bradford was not prepared
to find Sylvia living in such daily state as the other surroundings implied. He knew that she
belonged to a prosperous family, but his entrance to what he supposed would be, as the name
implied, a country cottage, was a decided shock to him.

He had been drawn irresistibly toward Sylvia almost from their meeting in the lecture room
several years before, but he could hardly allow himself the luxury of day dreams then, and
it was not until his promotion had seemed to him to place him upon a safe footing, that he
had paused long enough to realize how completely she was woven into all his thoughts of the
future. Now, as he waited there, a broad gulf, not a crossable river, seemed to stretch before
him, not alone financial but ethical,--a sweeping troublous torrent, the force of which he
could neither stem nor even explain to himself,--verily the surging of the Whirlpool at his feet.

Babbling girlish voices waked him from his revery, and half a dozen young figures, disguised
in handsomely embroidered Japanese costumes and headgear, their eyes given the typical almond-shaped
and upward slant by means of paint and pencil, came down the stairs, followed a moment later
by a taller figure in still richer robes, and so carefully made up by powder and paint that
at a distance she looked but little older than the girls. Coming toward Bradford with an expression
of playful inquiry, she said: "Is this Mr. Bradford? I am Mrs. Latham. Did you wish to see
me? I've only a moment to spare, for at three o'clock I lose my identity and become a Geisha girl."

Bradford was embarrassed for a moment, even quite disconcerted. Why should he have taken it
for granted that Sylvia had spoken of him, and that he should be known to her mother? But such
was the case, and he felt bitterly humbled.

"I was one of Miss Latham's instructors at Rockcliffe two years ago. I have returned now to
spend the vacation with my mother, whom perhaps you know, at Pine Ridge, and finding that you
have come to live here--I--ventured to call." If poor Bradford had desired to be stiff and
uninterestingly didactic, he could not have succeeded better.

"Ah, yes--Rockcliffe--Sylvia was there for a couple of years, and will doubtless be glad to
hear of the place. I myself never approved of college life for girls, it makes them so superior
and offish when they return to society. Even two years abroad have not put Sylvia completely
at her ease among us again.

so one can never tell. I've half a mind to be rebellious and ask to be left here with Lavinia
Dorman for guardian, I'm so tired of change. Yes, I enjoyed my flying trip to the West, in
a way, though father only came as far as Chicago with me, but I expect him to-morrow."

Then the crowd surged along, peering, staring, and feeling, so that it would have blocked the
way conspicuously if Bradford had lingered longer. As he vanished, Monty Bell sauntered up,
and, entering the booth, took his place by Sylvia. Under pretext of good-naturedly saving her
fingers from thorns by tying the bouquets for her, kept by her side all the afternoon, and
when a lull came at tea time, strolled with her toward the refreshment tent, where he coaxed
her to sit down to rest in one of the little recesses that lined the garden wall, where she
would be free from the crowd while he brought her some supper.

This she did the more readily because she was really tired, almost to the point of faintness,
and even felt grateful when Mr. Bell returned with some dainty food, and sat beside her to
hold her plate. She was so used to seeing him about at all hours, making himself generally
useful, that the little attentions he continually showered upon her never held a fragment of
personality in her eyes.

Now, however, something familiar in his manner jarred upon her and put her strangely on her
guard. One of the man's peculiarities was that he had a hypnotic manner, and presently, almost
before she could really understand what he was about, he had put his arm around her and was
making an easy, take-it-all-for-granted declaration of love.

For an instant she could not believe her ears, and then his tightening clasp brought realization.
Tearing herself away, and dropping her plate with a crash, she faced him with white face and
blazing eyes, saying but one word--"Stop!" in so commanding a tone that even his fluency faltered,
and he paused in exceeding amaze at the result of what he had supposed any woman of his set
would esteem an honour, much more this strange girl whose mother was engaged so systematically
in securing a place at the ladder top.

"If I had understood that your casual politeness to me and usefulness to my mother meant insult
such as this, we should have checked it long ago."

"Insult?" ejaculated Monty Bell, looking over his shoulder, apprehensive lest some one should
be within ear-shot, for to be an object of ridicule was the greatest evil that could come to
him. "You don't understand. I want you to marry me."

"Insult, most certainly! What else do you call it for a man with two little daughters, and
divorced by his wife for his own unforgivable fault, to ask any woman to marry him! Yes, I
know, you see. Lavinia Dorman is a friend of Mrs. Bell!"

"The devil!" muttered the man, still looking about uneasily, under the gaze of her uncompromising
accusation. In some way the directness of her words made him feel uncomfortable for the moment,
but he quickly recovered, changed his tactics, and burying his hands in his pockets, assumed
his usually jaunty air, while half a smile, half a sneer, crossed his face as he said lightly:
"What a droll, Puritan spitfire we are, aren't we? As if rearranged families were not a thing
of daily happening. Don't feel called upon to kick up a rumpus, it isn't necessary; besides,
take a tip from me, your mother won't like it! If you are through with that cup, I will take
the things back," and nonchalantly shying the bits of the broken plate into the bushes, he
went toward the refreshment tent, saying to his host, Mrs. Jenks-Smith, who was inquiring for
Sylvia: "Yes, she is yonder in the second arbour. I've taken her some tea, for she's quite
done up; that beastly overland trip home was too much for her in the first hot weather."

Consequently the warm-hearted Lady of the Bluffs was naturally prepared to find Sylvia sick
and faint, and urged sending her home, where she could slip in and get to bed unobserved, which
was the one thing that the girl most desired. Also this shrewd lady was wise enough to give
no sign, even though she drew her conclusions, when on turning to leave the arbour she saw
a bit of the broken plate lying on the ground at the opposite side near where a point of the
rustic work had torn a shred from Sylvia's mull drapery as she had pulled herself away.

       *       *       *       *       *

By the time that Sylvia had gained her room the warm twilight sky had been transformed to a
silver lake by the moon, but she neither enjoyed its beauty nor heard the music that was beginning
to come from the rose garden above, as well as the tea room below stairs. She sat by the window,
deaf to all outside things, with only one thought in her mind; she would gladly have buried
the occurrence of the arbour, if it were possible, but as it was, she must tell her mother,
as now, that his motive was made plain, Monty Bell, as a matter of course, could no longer
come to the house. Finally she went to bed and slept from sheer exhaustion, never for a moment
doubting that her mother would take her view of the matter. Presently the French maid crept
in and closed the blinds, wondering why Mademoiselle often seemed to take pleasure so sadly,
and appeared older than Madame, her mother, and then, feeling at liberty, hurried down gayly
to dance on the back porch with the loitering gentlemen's gentlemen who gathered there.

       *       *       *       *       *

Mrs. Latham slept late the next morning, and at eleven o'clock had only finished looking over
her mail without yet touching her breakfast, when, without waiting for an answer to her knock,
Sylvia entered. Her mother looked up in some surprise, for she did not encourage running in
and out at all hours, or any of the usual intimacies between a mother and grown daughter who
are companions. In fact she did not even ask Sylvia to sit down, or if she was ill, though
her pallor was very apparent, but merely raised questioning eyebrows, saying, "What is it?"
as she turned her attention to some legal-looking documents in her lace-decked lap.

Chilled to the heart Sylvia seated herself in a low chair by her mother, so that she need not
raise her voice, and twisting her hands nervously, told what had happened in as few words as
possible, much as if she had repeated them over and over until they were learned like a lesson.

Mrs. Latham's cold gray eyes at first snapped viciously, and then grew big with wonder as Sylvia
ended by saying, "I should never have spoken of this to any one, and tried to forget, but you
would think it strange that Mr. Bell should stop coming here--and--"

"Think it strange?" said Mrs. Latham, speaking harshly and rapidly, a thing she rarely did.
"Do you know what I think of you? That you are the most absolute little fool I ever imagined.
You not only refuse a man who could make your social position secure, but rant and get into
tantrums over the compliment he pays you, and call it an 'insult,' exactly as your canting
grandmother Latham might have done. I've no patience with you; and if you think that this nonsense
of yours shuts the door in Monty Bell's face, you are wholly mistaken.

"While we are upon this subject of divorce that seems to shock you so, I may as well tell you
what you will not see for yourself, and your father appears to have been too mealy-mouthed
to explain,--we have agreed to separate. No need of your getting tragic, there are no public
recriminations on either side, no vulgar infidelity or common quarrelling, everything quite
amicable, I assure you. Simply we find our tastes totally different, and have done so for several
years. Mr. Latham's ambitions are wholly financial, mine are social. He repelled and ignored
my best friends, and as we are in every way independent of each other, he has been wise enough
to avoid possible and annoying complications by standing out of my way and making it easy for
me to legalize the arrangement and readjust myself completely to new conditions."

"But what of Carthy and me?" gasped Sylvia, in a voice so choked and hollow that the older
woman hesitated, but for a single instant only. "Have neither you nor father thought of us?
Where do we belong? Where is our home? Can people who have once loved each other forget their
children and throw them off so? Does God allow it? You must have cared for father once, for
I remember when I was a little girl you told me that you called me Sylvia, to have my name
as nearly like father's--Sylvester--as possible. Have you forgotten it all, that you can do
this thing, when you say in the same breath that father has done no evil?"

"Don't be tragic, Sylvia, and rake up things that have nothing to do with the matter. As to
your brother, it was your father's foolish severity about a card debt, and insisting upon placing
him away from me, that is primarily responsible for the divorce, not any wish of mine to exile
Carthy. And you ask where your home is, as if I had turned you out, when you have just refused
an offer that any unmarried society woman, who can afford it, would clutch."

Sylvia sat silent, looking blindly before her. Her mother waited a moment, as if expecting
some reply, and then continued: "Now that the matter is virtually settled, I suppose in a few
days the papers will save me the trouble of announcing it. Under the circumstances, I shall
rent the Newport house for the season, as I have had several good offers, and go abroad for
two or three months on the continent, so that before my return the town house will be redecorated
and everything will be readjusted for a successful winter. You had better take a few days before
deciding what to do. You can, of course, come with me, if you are not sick of travel, or go
to your father, who is ready to make you a handsome allowance; though you will find that awkward
at present, as he is moving about so much. If you choose to feel aggrieved just now, you might
persuade your dear, prim Miss Dorman to either stay here with you or take that little furnished
house that is to rent on the lower road, if you prefer that form of discomfort they call simplicity.
You needn't decide now; take time," she added genially, as if she was doing all that could
be asked.

When she ceased speaking, Sylvia, with bowed head, rose and quickly left the room.

Then Mrs. Latham gave a sigh of relief that the interview was over, threw the papers into a
bureau drawer, called to the maid, who had been all the while listening in the dressing room,
to prepare to arrange her hair, and, taking the chances that Sylvia would keep her room, at
least for some hours, wrote a hasty note to Monty Bell, inviting him to luncheon.

Meanwhile, Sylvia, instead of going to her room to cry, took her hat and crept out into the
lane that led to the woods. She must be quite away by herself and gain time to think. This
was a terrible sort of grief that could neither be kept secret nor halved by sympathy, but
must be worn in the full glare of day. Her heart condemned her mother wholly, and she understood
why her father kept the silence of shame,--to whom could she turn? As she gained the woods,
and throwing herself down on a soft bed of hemlock needles, closed her dry, burning eyes, two
people seemed to stand side by side and look at her pityingly,--Lavinia Dorman and Horace Bradford,--and
mentally she turned toward one and shrank from the other. In Miss Lavinia she saw her only
refuge, but between herself and Horace the shadow of his upright mother seemed to intervene.
What could they think of her mother playing at Geisha girl in her own home at the very hour
of its wreck?

XII

HIS MOTHER

July 1. It was several days after the festival before the news of the Latham divorce was made
definitely public by a paragraph under the heading of "Society News," in one of the New York
papers, though of course the rumour had crept into every house on the Bluffs, by way of the
back stairs.

Miss Lavinia was greatly distressed, and yet did not know exactly how to act in the matter;
for though Mrs. Latham was seen driving by, as usual, Sylvia made no sign.

We may read of such cases often enough, and yet when the blow falls in the immediate neighbourhood,
one must feel the reflex of the shock. While sympathy for Sylvia keeps the thing ever present,
like a weight upon the chest, I find myself wondering if anything could have been done to avert
the disaster, and we all rove about in a half unsettled condition. Half a dozen times a day
Lavinia Dorman starts up with the determination of calling upon Sylvia, but this morning decided
upon writing her a letter instead, and having sent it up by Timothy Saunders, is now sitting
out in the arbour, while Martin Cortright is reading to her from his manuscript; but her attention
is for the first time divided, and she is continually glancing up the road as if expecting
a summons,--a state of things that causes an expression of mild surprise and disappointment
to cross Martin's countenance at her random and inapropos criticisms. I see that in my recent
confusion I have forgotten to record the fact that Miss Lavinia has fallen into the rôle of
critic for Martin's book, and that for the last ten days, as a matter of course, he reads to
her every afternoon the result of his morning's work, finding, as he says, that her power of
condensation is of the greatest help in enabling him to eliminate much of the needless detail
of his subject that blocked him, and to concentrate his vitality upon the rest.

This all looks promising, to my romantic mind; for the beginning of all kinds of affection,
physical, mental, and spiritual, that are huddled together in varying proportions as component
parts of love, has its origin in dependence. Father declares independence, selfishness, and
aloofness to be the trinity of hell. Now Martin Cortright has come to depend upon Lavinia Dorman's
opinion, and she is beginning not only to realize and enjoy his dependence, but to aid and
abet it. Is not this symptomatic?

When I approach father upon the Latham affair, he says that he thinks the rupture was inevitable
from the point of view and conditions that existed. He feels, from the evidence that long experience
with the inner life of households has given him, that though a thoughtless woman may be brought
to realize, and a woman with really bad inherited instincts reclaimed, through love, the wholly
selfish woman of Mrs. Latham's type remains immovable to word of God or man, and is unreachable,
save through the social code of the class that forms her world, and this code sanctions both
the marriage and the divorce of convenience, and receives the results equally with open arms.

As to the effect upon Sylvia, father exhibits much concern, and no little anxiety, for he has
read her as a nature in some respects old for her twenty-one years, and in others, the side
of the feminine, wholly young and unawakened, so that this jar, he thinks, comes at a most
critical moment.

He has a pretty theory that the untroubled heart of a young girl is like a vessel full of the
fresh spring sap of the sugar maple that is being freed by slow fire from its crudities and
condensed to tangible form. When a certain point is reached, it is ready to crystallize about
the first object that stirs it ever so lightly, irrespective of its quality: this is first
love. But if the condensing process is lingering, no jar disturbing it prematurely until, as
it reaches perfection, the vital touch suddenly reaches its depths, then comes real love, perfected
at first sight, clinging everlastingly to the object, love that endures by its own strength,
not by mere force of habit; and this love belongs only to the heart's springtime, before full
consciousness has made it speculative.

When Horace Bradford drove homeward the afternoon of the fête, he was in a brown study, having
no realization of time or place until the wise horse turned in at the barnyard gate, and after
standing a moment by his usual hitching post, looked over his shoulder and gave a whinny to
attract his master's attention. Then Horace started up, shook off his lethargy, and hurried
to the porch, where his mother stood waiting, to give her the roses, and Sylvia's message.

Mrs. Bradford was, for one of her reserve, almost childishly eager to hear of the experiences
of the afternoon, and was prepared to sit down comfortably on the porch and have her son give
a full account of it; but instead, he gave her a few rather incoherent details, and leaving
her standing with the splendid roses held close to her face, very much in Sylvia's own attitude,
he hurried up to his room, where she could hear him moving about as if unpacking his things,
and opening and shutting drawers nervously.

"Never mind," she said softly to herself, "he will tell me all about her when he is ready.
Meanwhile, I'll wait, and not get in his way,--that is what mothers are for." But by some strange
impulse she loosened the string that bound the roses, and placed them in one of her few treasures,
a silver bowl, in the centre of the supper table, and going to her bedchamber, which was, country
fashion, back of the sitting room, arrayed herself in Horace's gifts,--the silk gown and fichu,
with the onyx bar and butterflies to fasten it,--and then returned to the porch to watch the
twilight gently veil sunset.

Upstairs, Horace unpacked his trunks in a rebellious mood. In the morning he had felt in the
proper sense self-sufficient and contented,--the position, which a few months before he thought
perhaps ten years ahead of him, had suddenly dropped at his feet, and he felt a natural elation,
though it stopped quite short of self-conceit. He could afford to relax the grip with which
he had been holding himself in check, and face the knowledge that he loved Sylvia; while the
fact that fate had brought her to summer in his vicinity seemed but another proof that fortune
was smiling upon him.

Now everything, though outwardly the same, was changed by the new point of view, which he realized
that he had already tried to conceal from his mother, by his scanty account of the festival.
He had been suddenly confronted by conditions that he never expected to meet outside of the
pages of fiction, and felt himself utterly unable to combat them. Under the present circumstances
even neighbourly friendship with Sylvia would be difficult. It was not that Mrs. Latham had
overawed him in the least, but she had raised in him so fierce and blinding a resentment by
her only half unconscious reference to his mother, that he resolved that under no circumstances
should she run the risk of being equally rebuffed. He would protect her from a possible intercourse,
where she could not be expected, at her age, to hold her own, at no matter what cost to himself.

"Egg woman!" Was it not his mother's pride and endeavour, her thrift and courage to carry on
the great farm alone, and the price of such things as those very eggs, that had carried through
his dying father's wish, and sent him to college, thus giving him his chance in the world?
No regret at the fact, no false pride, dawned on him even for a second. All his rage was that
such a woman as Sylvia's mother should have the power to stir him so, and then his love for
Sylvia herself, intensified by pity for the unknown trouble that he sensed rather than read
in her face, cut into him like a wound. He felt as if he must pick her up in his strong arms
and bear her away from all those clamouring people; and then the realization both of his inability
and ignorance of her own attitude fell upon him like a chill, for she had never written or
said a word to him that might not have passed between any two college friends. Such thoughts
occupied him, until finally, as often fortunately happens in our mental crises, a humdrum,
domestic voice, the supper bell, called him, and leaving his garments strewn about the room,
he went downstairs.

His mother was still sitting in the porch, and he became at once conscious of a change in her
appearance. As she looked up in pleased expectancy, he recognized the cause, and his sternness
vanished instantly, as he said, "How fine we look to-night," and half sitting on the little
foot-bench beside her, and half kneeling, he touched the soft lace, and gently kissed the withered
cheek whose blood was still not so far from the surface but that it could return in answer
to the caress, while she looked yearningly into the eyes that even now were hardly on a level
with hers, as if searching for the cause of what might be troubling him. Yet she only said,
as they rose and went indoors, "I put on your gifts for you, at our first supper together,"
adding with an unconsciousness that made Horace smile in spite of himself,--"besides, I shouldn't
wonder if some of the neighbours might drop in to see us, for it must have got about by this
time that you've come home; the mail carrier saw you drive out this morning, I'm quite sure."

Neighbours did call; some from pure friendliness, others to see if "Horace acted set up by
his new callin' and fortune," and still others, who had been to the Bluffs that afternoon,
to tell of the wonders of the festival, their praise or condemnation varying according to age,
until Mrs. Bradford was at a loss whether to think the affair a spectacle of fairyland or a
vision of the bottomless pit, and Horace was in torment lest he should be appealed to for an
opinion, which he was presently. "What did he think of the tea room? Was Mrs. Latham painted?
Was she Sylvia's mother, or step-mother, and if she was the former, didn't she act dreadful
giddy for the mother of grown children? And didn't he think Sylvia was just sweet, so different
from the rest, and sort of sad, as if she had a step-mother, as people said, and was sat on?" No series
nevertheless necessitate to dominate, its entire period having been about 1150 period. The broadcast
of“ great grooms” of which two occur in 1865 and 1883, while others
will exist in 1901, 1919, 1937, 1955, and 1973, discontinue the instance

There are the further matter which overshadow of be attend connected with the regularity of
interruption.

At this point Mrs. Bradford made an effort to turn the conversation into other channels; for
friendly as she always was with her neighbours of all degrees, she never allowed unkind gossip
in her house, and only a newcomer would have ventured upon it. As it was, the loquacious one
felt the rebuke in the air, and made hasty adieus on the plea of having to set bread, leaving
the rest to talk to their host of themselves, their pleasure at his return, and the local interests
of Pine Ridge.

When they had all gone, Horace locked the back door, after filling an old yellow and bronze
glazed pitcher, which bric-à-brac hunters would have struggled for, at the well, as he had
done every night during his boyhood, he left it on the hall table, and going out the front
way to the garden, walked up and down the long straight walk, between the sweet peas and rose
bushes, for more than an hour, until, having fought to no conclusion the battle into which
a new foe had entered, he returned to the house and went noiselessly to his room.

Here, in place of the confusion he had left, quiet and order reigned. All his clothes were
laid away in their old places. He had but to reach his hand inside the closet, the door of
which hesitated before opening in its familiar way, to find his night gear; the sheets were
turned down at the exact angle, and the pillows arranged one crosswise, one upright, as he
liked them,--his mother's remembering touch was upon everything.

He undressed without striking a light, and lay down, only to look wakefully out at the dark
lattice of tree branches against the moonlit sky. Presently a step sounded on the stairs and
paused at his partly open door. He raised himself on his elbow, and peering through the crack
saw his mother standing there in night-dress and short sack, shading the candle with her hand
as she used when he was a little chap, to make sure that he was safe asleep and had not perhaps
crept out the window to go coon hunting with the bigger boys,--a proceeding his father always
winked at, but which she feared would lead him to overdo and get a fever.

"I'm here, mother," he said cheerfully.

"Are you quite comfortable, Horace? Is there nothing that you want?"

He hesitated a moment, and then said frankly, "Yes and no, mother."

"Is it anything that I can do for you?" she asked, coming into the room and smoothing his hair
as she spoke.

"Ah, that is the no of it, and the hard part," he answered, capturing the hand and holding
it tight between his own.

"And the hard part for your old mother too, when the one thing comes that she cannot give or
do. Whatever it is, don't shut me out from it, Horace,--that is, unless you must," and tucking
the light summer quilt in Under the pillow by one of his hands, she kissed his forehead and
went away.

Horace Bradford must have slept, for his next consciousness was of the fresh wind and light
of morning, and as he drew his cramped hand from under his pillow, something soft and filmy
came with it,--a woman's handkerchief edged with lace.

For a minute he held it in surprise, and then began to search the corners for the marking.
There it was, two embroidered initials, S.L. Where had it dropped from? Who had put it there?
Was it a message or an accident? Yet it was both and neither. His mother had found the dainty
thing in the package from New York that held the gown and ornaments, where it had dropped from
Sylvia's waist that night, four months before, when she stood leaning on Miss Lavinia Dorman's
table, as the parcel was being tied.

Mrs. Bradford had pondered over it silently until, the day when I went to see her and chanced
to mention Sylvia Latham's name, its identity flashed upon her; and when gropingly she came
to associate this name with something that troubled Horace, obliterating self and mother jealousy,
she tucked the bit of linen underneath his pillow, with an undefined idea, knowing nothing,
in the hope that it might comfort him. And so it did; for even when he learned the manner of
its coming, he put it in his letter case as a reminder not to despair but wait.

       *       *       *       *       *

When a week had passed and the matter of the divorce had been well aired, discussed, and was
no longer a novelty to her neighbours on the Bluffs, Mrs. Latham's plan of soon closing her
cottage and transferring the servants to Newport, with the exception of the stable men and
a couple of caretakers, was announced, as she was going abroad for the baths. The same day
Lavinia Dorman received an urgent note from Sylvia, asking her "when and where she could see
her alone, if, as she thought likely, she did not feel inclined to come to the house." The
tone of the brief note showed that Sylvia felt the whole matter to be a keen disgrace that
not only compromised herself but her friends.

Of course Miss Lavinia went, and would have gone even if she had to combat Mrs. Latham, for
whom she asked courteously at the door; but that lady, for some reason, did not choose to appear
and run the gantlet, and sent an elaborate message about a sick headache by the now somewhat
crestfallen Perkins. Presently Sylvia slipped into the morning room, and crouching by Miss
Lavinia, buried her face in her friend's lap, the tension at last giving way, and it was some
time before she grew quiet enough to talk coherently, and tell her plan, which is this: she
wishes Miss Lavinia to take the Alton cottage (which is furnished) at the foot of the Bluffs,
for the rest of the season, and live there with her. Then as soon as Mrs. Latham has gone,
and the poor girl has steadied herself, her father, to whom she has already written, will come,
and what she will do in the autumn will be arranged. Everything is as yet vague; but one thing
she has decided for herself--under no circumstances will she again live with her mother, and
she is now staying quietly in the house and taking her meals in her room, in order to give
the scandalmongers and gossips as little material as possible.

Lavinia Dorman, who readily consented to do as she asked, says that Sylvia is brave and heartbroken
at the same time, that all her girlish spontaneity has gone, and she is like a statue.

I am so sorry to have Miss Lavinia go, even a few hundred yards down the road, it has seemed
so good to have an older woman in the house to whom I can say, "Would you, or wouldn't you?"
Martin is also quite upset, and has stopped writing and begun fumbling and pulling the reference
books about again; but Miss Lavinia says that she is not going to give up the afternoon reading,
for she thinks the history is a work of importance not to be slighted, and that Sylvia will
doubtless take up her own reading and practising after a time; that while she herself has willingly
consented to chaperon her, she does not intend to give up her own freedom, nor would it be
good for Sylvia if she did.

Yesterday morning Miss Lavinia received a letter from Sylvester Latham, thanking her for the
offer of temporary protection for his daughter, and telling her, in curt business terms, meant
to be affable, to name her own price for the office.

I have never before seen the ladylike Lavinia Dorman so completely and ungovernably angry.
I could do nothing with her, and last evening it took the united efforts of Martin, father,
and Evan to convince her that it was not a real affront. Poor Mr. Latham, he has not yet gotten
beyond money valuation of friendship; but then it is probably because he has had no chance.
Perhaps--but no, life is too serious just now in that quarter for me to allow myself remotely
pleasant perhapses.

Miss Lavinia was too agitated to play piquet to-night, so she and Martin sat in the porch where
the light from the hall lamp was sufficient to enable them to play a couple of games of backgammon,
to steady her nerves, she said; and presently, as the dice ceased rattling, Evan gave me a
nudge of intelligence, and looking over I found that they had reversed the board and were playing
"Give away" with checkers.

"After this, what?" I whispered to Evan.

"Jackstraws," he answered, shaking with silent laughter.

       *       *       *       *       *

Horace Bradford turned his mind for the next few days to the many things about the place that
needed his attention, resolving that he would let a week or so elapse before making any further
attempt to see Sylvia, and in that time hoped to find Miss Lavinia at home, and from her possibly
receive some light upon the gossip about Mr. Bell, as well as news of Sylvia herself.

The sinking-fund for repairs and rebuilding the house that he and his mother had been accumulating
ever since he had made his own way, he found to be in a healthy condition. A new hay barn and
poultry house was to be put up at once; and, as soon as practicable, his wish of many years,
to restore the brick house, that had been marred by "lean-tos" in the wrong places, to its
colonial simplicity, could be at least begun.

Every day until two or three o'clock in the afternoon he gave to these affairs, and then he
went to his books. But here again he met with a strange surprise, a new sensation,--he could
neither fix his mind upon writing, nor take in what he read; the letters were as meaningless
as fly specks on the pages. After a day or two he gave up the attempt. He had worked too closely
during the last term, he thought; his sight did not register on his brain,--he had heard of
such cases; he would rest a week or so.

Then every afternoon he walked over the Ridge to the little river in the valley, carrying a
book in his pocket, and his fishing-rod as a sort of excuse, and poling an old flatboat down-stream
to a shady spot under the trees, propped his rod in place, where by a miracle he occasionally
caught a perch or bass, sat looking idly into the water, the brim of an old felt hat turned
down about his eyes. One day, near the week's end, as he was lounging thus, his eye was attracted
by a headline in a bit of newspaper in which he had wrapped his bait box to save his pocket.
It was a semi-local paper from town, one that his mother took, but which they seldom either
of them read, and the date was three days back. He turned it over idly, pausing as he did so
to pull up the line which was being jerked violently, but only by a mud eel. Why did he return
again to the scrap of paper when he had freed his hook? His eyes caught strange words, and
his hands began to tremble as he read. It was the condensed report of the Latham divorce that
was now going the rounds of the journals.

He paused a moment, then folded the paper, put it in his pocket, poled the boat with vigorous
strokes to the landing-place, and strode through the woods and across the cornfields homeward,
his heart beating tumultuously until he seemed almost to be struggling with suffocation.

He stopped at the barn and harnessed a horse to the old buggy, passing by the new one that
he had recently ordered from town, and then went into the house, where, taking off his slouchy
fishing clothes, he put on the same ceremonious afternoon wear that he would have worn at Northbridge
if going to call, put Sylvia's handkerchief in his inner pocket, and went in search of his mother.

He found her in the kitchen, tying the covers upon countless jars of currant jam. She looked
surprised to see him back at such an hour, but said nothing, as Esther Nichols was close by,
employed in wiping off the jars.

"I'm going over to Oaklands for a drive," he said, handing her the scrap of newspaper with
a gesture that meant silence.

"Shall I wait supper for you, or will you be late?" she said, touching his hand with a gesture
almost of entreaty.

"I may be late, but--yes, you may wait supper," he replied, looking back at her in going out,
as if he wanted to carry the picture well forward in his mind, against any forgetfulness.

The miles between Pine Ridge and the Bluffs seemed endless. He had at first intended to go
to Oaklands village to see Miss Lavinia and gather such tidings as he could of the calamity
that had overtaken Sylvia; for he never for a moment questioned but that the girl, who had
been entirely straightforward, even in days of college pranks, should so regard the matter.
But as he drove along, and the very fact that he was moving toward a definite end calmed him
and clarified his judgment, he resolved to go directly to Sylvia herself. He would certainly
do this if he had seen the announcement of her parents' deaths; then why not now, when their
love that gave her birth was officially and publicly declared extinct?

He drove through the wide gateway and left his horse standing by a stone pillar outside the
porte-cochère,--the beast would stand anywhere if there was a bar or post for him to look at,--and
walked up the steps with the air of one who is not to be gainsaid.

"Not at home," replied the singsong voice of Perkins, in answer to Bradford's demand for Miss
Latham, Potts and Parker having already gone to open the Newport house for the renter, as a
staff of servants was let with it, and then he added, as if conferring a favour, "and Mrs.
Latham has gone on the coach to the station to meet some guests, the last 'ouse party before
she sails."

"Before she sails," thought Bradford, numbly. Sylvia was going? Could he believe the man? Should
he go through the formality of leaving a card that she might not get? No, he would go home
and write a letter.

Sylvia kept the house until late in the afternoon, these days. Then she slipped out by the
servants' stairway, and through the garden, to walk in the wood lane that ran northward, joining
the two parallel highroads; for her healthy body needed air, and she knew that if she did not
have it, she could not control herself to keep peaceful silence for even the few days that
remained. So it chanced this afternoon that she was walking to and fro in the quiet lane where
the ferns crept down quite to the grassy wheel tracks, when Perkins said those repellent words,
"Not at home."

As Bradford turned out the gate and noticed that the sun was already setting, he thought to
save time by cutting through the almost unused lane to the turnpike that led directly to Pine
Ridge. He had driven but halfway across, when a flutter of light garments a little way ahead
attracted him. Could it be? Yes, it was Sylvia, in truth, and at the moment that he recognized
her and sprang to the ground she heard the approaching hoofs and turned. From FAMALICAO there is
a course to Oporto most standing round the littoral and 15m. deeper than the line. The house
Lima is hither added up by a bridge (imagination'road) one ft. long nothing.
ERMEZINDE is the place with the chorus to Barca’ Alva, Salamanca and France.


She gave her hands, and in another moment his strong arms held her fast and unresisting--the
purifying friendship of those unconscious years crystallized and perfected at love's first touch.

They said but very little as they walked up and down the lane together, for half an hour; but
as the shadows lengthened, the thought came equally to both--"What should they do next? How
could they part, and yet how stay together?" Horace, with man's barbarian directness, would
have liked to bear her home to safety and his mother; but the shadow of usage and her mother
stood between, for in spite of the hollow mockery of it all, Sylvia was still of her household.

"I must take you home," he said at last, "and to-morrow I will come--all shall be arranged."

"To-night," she whispered, clasping his arm in nervous terror. "Come back with me and tell
her to-night; then I shall feel sure, and not as if it was not real. And when you have told
her,--before whoever may be there, remember,--go home; do not stop to listen to anything she
may say."

They drove slowly back, and went up the steps to the house, from which voices and laughter
came, hand in hand, like two children; but they were children no longer when they crossed the
threshold and saw Monty Bell in the group that loitered with Mrs. Latham in the reception hall,
waiting for dinner to be announced.

Sylvia's thin gown was wet with dew, her hair was tossed about, her eyes big with excitement,
and a red spot burned in each cheek in startling contrast to her pallor--all of which gave
her a wild and unusual beauty that absolutely startled as well as shocked her mother, letting
her think for a second that Sylvia was going to make a scene, had gone mad, perhaps, and run
away, and that the tall man holding her by the hand had found her and brought her home.

Taking a few hasty steps forward, and dreading anything disagreeably tragic, she said: "Mr.
Bradford, I believe. [old common: rað], she rathe (gerathe i broke, grathedly, rather), even
(gradely be a Sanscrit), have as assume a progenitor was the readier
[feeling: bell] (radh), which is interpreted "a perfection;" in words,
"a age." Horace Bradford drew himself up to every
inch of his full height as he spoke, bowed to Mrs. Latham, then led Sylvia to the foot of the
stairs, saying, "Until to-morrow," and walked quietly out of the house.

No one spoke. Then Mrs. Latham, choking with rage, feeling herself helplessly at bay (Sylvia
was of age, and she could not even assume authority under the circumstances), collapsed on
a divan in modified hysterics, and Monty Bell, completely thunderstruck, finally broke the
silence by his characteristic exclamation, "I'll be damned!"

       *       *       *       *       *

After their belated supper, when Esther Nichols had gone over to a neighbour's, Horace, sitting
by his mother's side, out in the honeysuckled porch, where the sphinx moths whirred like humming-birds
of night, holding her hands in his, told her all. And she, stifling the mother pain that, like
a birth pang, expected yet dreaded, must come at first when the other woman, no matter how
welcome, steps between, folded his hands close, as if she held him again a baby in her arms,
and said, smiling through vague tears, "To-morrow we will go together to her, my blessed son."

"I cannot ask you to do that; there are reasons--I will bring Sylvia to you later, when her
mother has gone," he answered hastily, resolving that he would do anything to shield her self-respect
from the possible shock of meeting that other mother.

"Horace, you forget yourself, and your father too," she said almost sternly. "I am country
bred, but still I know the world's ways. Your father's wife will go first to greet her who
will be yours; you need not fear for me," and he sat silent.

That next afternoon, when Horace's first and last love met, they looked into each other's hearts
and saw the same image there, while Mrs. Latham lay on the lounge in her room, raging within,
that again her tongue had failed her in her own house, and realizing that, woman of the world
as she aimed to be, the "egg woman" had rendered her helpless by mere force of homely courtesy.
Presently she rose, and railing and scolding the bewildered maid, sent a message to New York
to transfer her passage, if possible, to an earlier steamer.

GOSSIP AND THE BUG HUNTERS
