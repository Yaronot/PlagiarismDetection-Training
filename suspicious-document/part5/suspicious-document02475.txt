If my advent among them had caused a stir, the entrance of this old woman caused a bustle;
even the dead man seemed to salute her, or was it only my imagination--for I was in a strangely
sensitive mood--that pictured it? As she slowly approached, leaning heavily on a rough, thick
staff, all the females present bent their knees. Now prayers were going to be offered up for
the dead, and the visible woman was to act as interceder with the invisible one in heaven.
After being assisted to her knees, the old woman, in a cracked, yet loud, voice, began. "Santa
Maria, ruega por nosotros, ahora, y en la hora de nuestra muerte!" (Holy Mary pray for us now,
and in the hour of our death!) This was responded to with many gesticulations and making of
crosses by the numerous females around her. The prayers were many and long, and must have lasted
perhaps an hour; then all arose, and mate and cigars were served. Men and women, even boys
and girls, smoked the whole night through, until around the Departed was nothing but bluish clouds.

The natives are so fond of wakes that when deaths do not occur with great frequency, the bones
of "grandma" are dug up, and she is prayed and smoked over once more. The digging up of the
dead is often a simple matter, for the corpse is frequently just carried into the bush, and
there covered with prickly branches.

THE SNAKE'S HISTORY.

I met with a snake, of a whitish color, that appeared to have two heads. Never being able to
closely examine this strange reptile, I cannot positively affirm that it possesses the two
heads, but the natives repeatedly affirmed to me that it does, and certainly both ends are,
or seem to be, exactly alike. In the Book of Genesis the serpent is described as "a beast,"
but for its temptation of Eve it was condemned to crawl on its belly and become a reptile.
A strange belief obtains among the people that all serpents must not only be killed, but put
into a fire. If there is none lit, they will kindle one on purpose, for it must be burned.
As the outer skin comes off, it is declared, the four legs, now under it, can be distinctly seen.

A GIRL'S NEW BIRTH AND TRANSLATION.

At Rincon I held a series of meetings in a mud hut. Men and women, with numerous children,
used to gather on horseback an hour before the time for opening. A little girl always brought
her three-legged stool and squatted in front of me. The rest appropriated tree-trunks and bullocks'
skulls. The girl referred to listened to the Gospel story as though her life depended upon
it, as indeed it did! When at Rincon only a short time, the child desired me to teach her how
to pray, and she clasped her hands reverently. "Would Jesus save me?" she asked. "Did He die
for me--me? Will He save me now?" The girl believed, and entered at once into the family of God.

One day a man on horseback, tears streaming down his cheeks, galloped up to my hut. It was
her father. His girl was dead. She had gone into the forest, and, feeling hungry, had eaten
some berries; they were poisonous, and she had come home to die. Would I bury her? Shortly
afterwards I rode over to the hovel where she had lived. Awaiting me were the broken-hearted
parents. A grocery box had been secured, and this rude coffin was covered with pink cotton.
Four horses were yoked in a two-wheeled cart, the parents sat on the casket, and I followed
on horseback to the nearest cemetery, sixteen miles away. There, in a little enclosure, we
lowered the girl into her last earthly resting- place, in the sure and certain hope of a glorious
resurrection. She had lived in a house where a cow's hide served for a door, but she had now
entered the "pearly gates." The floor of her late home was mother earth; what a change to be
walking the "streets of gold!" Some day, "after life's fitful fever," I shall meet her again,
not a poor, ragged half-breed girl, but glorified, and clothed in His righteousness.

HOW I DID NOT LOSE MY EYES.

One day I was crossing a river, kneeling on my horse's back, when he gave a lurch and threw
me into the water. Gaining the bank, and being quite alone, I stripped off my wet clothes and
waited for the sun to dry them. The day was hot and sultry, and, feeling tired, I covered myself
up with the long grass and went to sleep. How long I lay I cannot tell, but suddenly waking
up, I found to my alarm that several large vultures, having thought me dead, were contemplating
me as their next meal! Had my sleep continued a few moments longer, the rapacious birds would
have picked my eyes out, as they invariably do before tearing up their victim. All over the
country these birds abound, and I have counted thirty and forty tearing up a living, quivering
animal. Sometimes, for mercy's sake, I have alighted and put the suffering beast out of further
pain. Before I got away they have been fighting over it again in their haste to suck the heart's
blood.

A BACHELOR RABBIT.

The pest of Australia is the rabbit, but, strange to say, I never found one in South America.
In their place is the equally destructive viscacha or prairie dog--a much larger animal, probably
three or four times the size, having very low, broad head, little ears, and thick, bristling
whiskers. His coat is gray and white, with a mixture of black. To all appearance this is a
ferocious beast, with his two front tusk-like teeth, about four inches long, but he is perfectly
harmless. The viscacha makes his home, like the rabbit, by burrowing in the ground, where he
remains during daylight. The faculty of acquisition in these animals must be large, for in
their nightly trips they gather and bring to the mouth of their burrow anything and everything
they can possibly move. Bones, manure, stones and feathers are here collected, and if the traveller
accidentally dropped his watch, knife or handkerchief, it would be found and carried to adorn
the viscacha's doorway, if those animals were anywhere near.

The lady reader will be shocked to learn that the head of the viscacha family, probably copying
a bad example from the ostrich, his neighbor, is also very unamiable with his "better half,"
and inhabits bachelor's quarters, which he keeps all to himself, away from his family. The
food of this strange dog-rabbit is roots, and his powerful teeth are well fitted to root them
up. At the mouth of their burrows may often be seen little owls, which have ejected the original
owners and themselves taken possession. They have a strikingly saucy look, and possess the
advantage of being able to turn their heads right around while the body remains immovable.
Being of an inquisitive nature, they stare at every passer-by, and if the traveller quietly
walks around them he will smile at the grotesque power they have of turning their head. When
a young horse is especially slow in learning the use of the reins, I have known the cowboy
smear the bridle with the brains of this clever bird, that the owl's facility in turning might
thus be imparted to it.

Another peculiar animal is the comadreka, which resembles the kangaroo in that it is provided
with a bag or pouch in which to carry its young ones. I have surprised these little animals
(for they are only of rabbit size) with their young playing around them, and have seen the
mother gather them into her pouch and scamper away.

DRINKING WATER, SAINTS AND THE VIRGIN.

In Uruguay it is the custom for all, on approaching a house, to call out, "Holy Mary the Pure!"
and until the inmate answers: "Conceived without sin!" not a step farther must be made by the
visitor. At a hut where I called there was a baby hanging from the wattle roof in a cow's hide,
and flies covered the little one's eyes. On going to the well for a drink I saw that there
was a cat and a rat in the water, but the people were drinking it! When smallpox breaks out
because of such unsanitary conditions, I have known them to carry around the image of St. Sebastian,
that its divine presence might chase away the sickness. The dress of the Virgin is often borrowed
from the church, and worn by the women, that they may profit by its healing virtues. A crucifix
hung in the house keeps away evil spirits.

The people were very religious, and no rain having fallen for five months, had concluded to
carry around a large image of the Virgin they had, and show her the dry crops. I rode on, but
did not get wet!

 Just as I was making the circuit for the third time, I

the inhabitants had hidden themselves when the boy galloped up with the message of my approach.

I FIND DIAMONDS.

Encamped on the banks of the Black River, idly turning up the soil with the stock of my riding-whip,
I was startled to find what I believed to be real diamonds! Beautifully white, transparent
stones they were, and, rising to examine them closely in the sunlight, I was more than ever
convinced of the richness of my find. Was it possible that I had unwittingly discovered a diamond
field? Could it be true that, after years of hardship, I had found a fortune? I was a rich
man--oh, the enchanting thought! No need now to toil through scorching suns. I could live at
ease. As I sat with the stones glistening in the light before my eyes, my brain grew fevered.
Leaving my hat and coat on the ground, I ran towards my horse, and, vaulting on his bare back,
wildly galloped to and fro, that the breezes might cool my fevered head. Rich? Oh, how I had
worked and striven! Life had hitherto been a hard fight. When I had gathered together a few
dollars, I had been prostrated with malarial or some other fever, and they had flown. After
two or three months of enforced idleness I had had to start the battle of life afresh with
diminished funds. Now the past was dead; I could rest from strife. Rest! How sweet it sounded
as I repeated aloud the precious word, and the distant echoes brought back the word, Rest!

I was awakened from my day dreams by being thrown from my horse! Hope for the future had so
taken possession of me that the present was forgotten. I had not seen the caves of the prairie
dog, but my horse had given a sudden start aside to avoid them, and I found myself licking
the dust. Bather a humiliating position for a man to be in who had just found unlimited wealth;
Somewhat subdued, I made my way back to my solitary encampment.

Well, how shall I conclude this short but pregnant chapter of my life? Suffice it to say that
my idol was shattered! The stones were found to be of little worth.

A MAN WITH TWO NOSES AND TWO MOUTHS.

I was lost one day, and had been sitting in the grass for an hour or more wondering what I
should do, when the sound of galloping hoofs broke the silence. On looking around, to my horror,
I saw a something seated on a fiery horse tearing towards me! What could it be? Was it human?
Could the strange-looking being who suddenly reined up his horse before me be a man? A man
surely, but possessing two noses, two mouths, and two hare-lips. A hideous sight! I shuddered
as I looked at him. His left eye was in the temple, and he turned it full upon me, while with
the other he seemed to glance toward the knife in his belt. When he rode up I had saluted him,
but he did not return the recognition. Feeling sure that the country must be well known to
him, I offered to reward him if he would act as my guide. The man kept his gleaming eye fixed
upon me, but answered not a word. Beginning to look at the matter in rather a serious light,
I mounted my horse, when he grunted at me in an unintelligible way, which showed me plainly
that he was without the power of speech. He turned in the direction I had asked him to take,
and we started off at a breakneck speed, which his fiery horse kept up. I cannot say he followed
his nose, or the reader might ask me which nose, but he led me in a straight line to an eminence,
from whence he pointed out the estancia I was seeking. The house was still distant, yet I was
not sorry to part with my strange guide, who seemed disinclined to conduct me further. I gave
him his fee, and he grunted his thanks and left me to pursue my journey more leisurely. A hut
I came to had been struck by lightning, and a woman and her child had been buried in the debris.
Inquiring the particulars, I was informed that the woman was herself to blame for the disaster.
The saints, they told me, have a particular aversion to the ombu tree, and this daring Eve
had built her house near one. The saints had taken spite at this act of bravado, and destroyed
both mother and daughter. Moral: Heed the saints.

A FLEET-FOOTED DEER.

One day an old man seriously informed me that in those parts there was a deer which neither
he nor any other one had been able to catch. Like the Siamese twins, it was two live specimens
in one. When I asked why it was impossible to catch the animal, he informed me that it had
eight legs with which to run. Four of the legs came out of the back, and, when tired with using
the four lower ones, it just turned over and ran with the upper set. I did not see this freak,
so add the salt to your taste, O reader.

I SLEEP WITH THE RATS.

Hospitality is a marked and beautiful feature of the Uruguayan people. At whatever time I arrived
at a house, although a stranger and a foreigner, I was most heartily received by the inmates.
On only one occasion, which I will here relate, was I grudgingly accommodated, and that was
by a Brazilian living on the frontier. The hot sun had ruthlessly shone on me all day as I
waded through the long arrow grass that reached up to my saddle. The scorching rays, pitiless
in their intensity, seemed to take the energy from everything living. All animate creation
was paralyzed. The relentless ball of fire in the heavens, pouring down like molten brass,
appeared to be trying to set the world on fire; and I lay utterly exhausted on my horse's neck,
half expecting to see all kindled in one mighty blaze! I had drunk the hot, putrid water of
the hollows, which did not seem to quench my thirst any, but perhaps did help to keep me from
drying up and blowing away. My tongue was parched and my lips dried together. Fortunately,
I had a very quiet horse, and when I could no longer bear the sun's burning rays I got down
for a few moments and crept under him.

Shelter there was none. The copious draughts of evil-smelling water I had drunk in my raging
thirst brought on nausea, and it was only by force of will that I kept myself from falling,
when on an eminence I joyfully sighted the Brazilian estancia. Hope then revived in me. My
knowing horse had seen the house before me, and without any guidance made straight towards
it at a quicker pace. Well he knew that houses in those desolate wastes were too far apart
to be passed unheeded by, and I thoroughly concurred in his wisdom. As I drew up before the
lonely place my tongue refused to shout "Ave Maria," but I clapped my perspiring hands, and
soon had the satisfaction of hearing footsteps within. Visions of shade and of meat and drink
and rest floated before my eyes when I saw the door opened. A coal-black face peeped out, which,
in a cracked, broken voice, I addressed, asking the privilege to dismount. Horror of horrors,
I had not even been answered ere the door was shut again in my face! Get down without permission
I dare not. The house was a large edifice, built of rough, undressed stones, and had a thick,
high wall of the same material all around.

Were the inmates fiends that they let me sit there, knowing well that there was no other habitation
within miles? As the minutes slowly lengthened out, and the door remained closed, my spirits
sank lower and lower. After a silence of thirty-five minutes, the man again made his appearance,
and, coming right out this time, stared me through and through. After this close scrutiny,
which seemed to satisfy him, but elicited no response to a further appeal from me, he went
to an outlying building, and, bringing a strong hide lasso, tied it around my horse's neck.
Not until that was securely fastened did he invite me to dismount. Presuming the lasso was
lent me to tie out my horse, I led him to the back of the house. When I returned, my strange,
unwilling host was again gone, so I lay down on a pile of hides in the shade of the wall, and,
utterly tired out, with visions of banquets floating before my eyes, I dropped off to sleep.

Perhaps an hour afterwards, I awoke to find a woman, black as night, bending over me. Not seeing
a visitor once in three months, her feminine curiosity had impelled her to come and examine
me. Seemingly more amiable than her husband, she spoke to me, but in a strange, unmusical language,
which I could not understand; and then she, too, left me. As evening approached, another inmate
of the house made his appearance. He was, I could see, of a different race, and, to my joy,
I found that he spoke fluently in Spanish. Conducting me to the aforementioned outhouse, a
place built of canes and mud, he told me that later on a piece of meat would be given me, and
that I could sleep on the sheepskins. I got the meat, and I slept on the skins. Fatigued as
I was, I passed a wretched night, for dozens of huge rats ran over my body, bit my hands, and
scratched my face, the whole night long. Morning at last dawned, and, with the first streaks
of coming day, I saddled my horse, and, shaking the dust of the Brazilian estancia off my feet,
resumed my journey.

THE BURSTING OF A MAN.

A friend of mine came upon an ostrich's nest. The bird was not near, so, dismounting, he picked
up an egg and placed it in an inside pocket of his coat. Continuing the journey, the egg was
forgotten, and the horse, galloping along, suddenly tripped and fell. The rider was thrown
to the ground, where he lay stunned. Three hours afterwards consciousness returned. As his
weary eyes wandered, he noticed, with horror, that his chest and side were thickly besmeared.
With a cry of despair, he lay back, groaning, "I have burst!" The presence of the egg he had
put in his pocket had quite passed from his mind!

I FIND A LONE SCOTSMAN.

One evening after a long day's journey, I reached a house, away near
the Brazilian frontier, and was surprised indeed to see that the
owner was a real live Scotsman. Great was my astonishment and
pleasure at receiving such a warm Scotch welcome. He was eighty miles
away from any village--alone in the mountains--and at the sight of me
he wept like a child. Never can I forget his anguish as he told me
that his beloved wife had died just a few days before, and that he
had buried her--"there in the glen." At the sight of a British face
he had completely broken down; but, pulling himself together, he
conducted me through into the courtyard, and the difficulty of my
journey was forgotten as we sat down to the evening meal.
 Being anxious to hear the story of her who had presided at his
board, I bade him recount to me the sad circumstances.

She was a "bonnie lassie," and he had "lo'ed her muckle." There they had lived for twelve years,
shut out from the rest of the world, yet content. Hand in hand they had toiled in joy and sorrow,
when no rain fell for eight long months, and their cattle died; or when increase was good,
and flocks and herds fat. Side by side they had stood alone in the wild tangle of the wilderness.
And now, when riches had been gathered and comfort could be had, his "lassie" had left him,
and "Oh! he grudged her sair to the land o' the leal!" Being so far removed from his fellows,
he had been compelled to perform the sacred offices of burial himself. Surrounded by kind hearts
and loving sympathizers, it is sad indeed to lose our loved ones. But how inexpressibly more
sad it is when, away in loneliness, a man digs the cold clay tomb for all that is left of his
only joy! When our dear ones sleep in "God's acre" surrounded by others it is sad. But how
much more heartbreaking is it to bury the darling wife in the depths of the mountains alone,
where a strong stone wall must be built around the grave to keey the wild beasts from tearing
out the remains! Only those who have been so situated can picture the solemnity of such a scene.

At his urgent request, I promised I would accompany him to the spot-- sanctified by his sorrow
and watered by his tears--where he had laid his dear one. Early the following morning a native
servant saddled two horses, and we rode in silence towards the hallowed ground. In about thirty
minutes we came in view of the quiet tomb. Encircling the grave he had built a high stone wall.
When he silently opened the gate, I saw that, although all the pasture outside was dry and
withered, that on the mound was beautifully green and fresh. Had he brought water from his
house, for there was none nearer, or was it watered by his tears? His greatest longing was,
as he had explained to me the previous night, that she should have a Christian burial, and
if I would read some chapter over her grave he would feel more content, he said. As with bared
heads we reverently knelt on the mound, I now complied with his request.

Never have I seen a man so broken with grief as was that lone Scotsman. There were no paid
mourners or idle sightseers. There was no show of sorrow while the heart remained indifferent
and untouched. It was the spectacle of a lone man who had buried his all and was left--

  "To linger when the sun of life,
   The beam that gilds its path, is gone--
  To feel the aching bosom's strife,
   When Hope is dead and Love lives on."

As we knelt there, I spoke to the man about salvation from sin, and unfolded God's plan of
inheritance and reunions in the future life. The Lord gave His blessing, and I left him next
day rejoicing in the Christ who said: "I am the resurrection and the life; he that believeth
in Me, though he were dead, yet shall he live."

As the world moves forward, and man pushes his way into the waste places of the earth, that
lonely grave will be forgotten. Populous cities will be built; but the doctrine the mountains
then heard shall live when the gloomy youth of Uruguay is forgotten.

THE WORD OF GOD CONTRASTED WITH THAT OF THE R. C. CHURCH.

"Mary must be the first object of our worship, St. Joseph the second."--Roman Catholic Catechism.
Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them, for I the Lord thy God am a jealous God."

"I most firmly assert that the images of Christ and of the mother of God, ever virgin, and
also of the other saints, are to be had and retained, and that due honor and veneration are
to be given to them."--Creed of Pope Pius IV.

"My glory will I not give to another, neither my praise to graven images."--Jehovah.

"The saints reigning together with Christ are to be honored and invocated; ... they offer prayers
to God for us... their relics are to be venerated."--Creed of Pope Pius IV.

"Mary is everything in heaven and earth, and we should adore her."-- The South American Priest.

"Search the Scriptures."--The Christ.

"All who read the Bible should be stoned to death."--Pope Innocent III.

PART VI.

MARIOLATRY AND IMAGE WORSHIP.

CHAPTER XIV.

MARIOLATRY AND IMAGE WORSHIP.

Before the light of Christianity dawned on ancient Rome, the Pantheon contained goddesses many
and gods many. Chief of these deities to receive the worship of the people seems to have been
Diana of the Ephesians, a goddess whose image fell down from Jupiter; the celestial Venus of
Corinth, and Isis, sister to Osiris, the god of Egypt. These popular images, so universally
worshipped, were naturally the aversion of the early followers of Christ. "The primitive Christians
were possessed with an unconquerable repugnance to the use and abuse of images. [Footnote:
Gibbons' "Rome."]

Having Paul's masterly epistle to the Romans, in the first chapter of which he so distinctly
portrays man's tendency to change "the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image made like
to corruptible man," and worship and serve the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed
forever, they were careful to remember that "God is a spirit," and to be worshipped only in
spirit. Peter, in his epistle to them, also wrote of the One "whom having not seen ye love."
As time wore on, however, the original inclination of man to worship a god he could see and
feel (a trait seen all down the pages of history) asserted itself, and Mary, the mother of
Christ, took the place in the eye and the heart previously occupied by her predecessors. [Footnote:
Just as this work goes to press, the dally papers of the world announce that the oldest idol
ever discovered has just been unearthed. The idol is a goddess, who is holding an infant in
her arms.] Being in possession of the Acts of the Apostles, which plainly declares that Mary
herself met with the rest of the disciples "for prayer and supplication," and, knowing from
the four Gospels that no worship had been at first given to her, the innovation was slow to
find favor; but, in the year 431, the Council of Ephesus decided that Mary was equal with God.

"After the ruin of paganism they were no longer restrained by the apprehension of an odious
parallel" in the idol worship. [Footnote: Gibbons' "Rome."]

It should be a most humiliating fact to the Romanists to have it recorded as authentic history
that "the great miracle-working Madonna of Rome, worshipped in the Church of St. Augustina,
is only a pagan statue of the wicked Agrippina with her infant Nero in her arms. Covered with
jewels and votive offerings, her foot encased in gold, because the constant kissing has worn
away the stone, this haughty and evil-minded Roman matron bears no possible resemblance to
the pure Virgin Mary; yet crowds are always at her feet, worshipping her. The celebrated bronze
statue of St. Peter, which is adored in the great Church, and whose feet are entirely kissed
away by the lips of devotees, is but an antique statue of Jupiter, an idol of paganism. All
that was necessary to make the pagan god a Christian saint was to turn the thunderbolt in his
uplifted right hand to two keys, and put a gilded halo around his head. Yet, on any Church
holiday, you will see thousands passing solemnly before this image (arrayed in gorgeous robes,
with the Pope's mitre on its head), and after bowing before it, rise on their toes and repeatedly
kiss its feet." [Footnote: Vickers' "Rome"]

This method of receiving heathen deities as saints has been common all over South America,
and many Indian idols may be seen in the churches, now adored as Roman Catholic saints, while
the worship of Mary has grown to an alarming extent. In Lima's largest church, printed right
over the chancel, is the motto, "Glory to Mary."

In Cordoba, the Argentine seat of learning--a city so old that university degrees were being
given there when the Pilgrim Fathers landed on the shores of New England--charms, amulets and
miniature images of the Virgin are manufactured in large numbers. These are worn around the
neck, and are supposed to work great wonders. As may be understood, the workers in these crafts
stand up for Romanism, and are willing to cry themselves hoarse for Mary, just as the people
of old cried for Diana of the Ephesians.

It is often told of the Protestant worker that he keeps behind his door an image of the Blessed
Virgin, and, when entering or leaving the house, he spits in her face. No pains are spared
to stamp out any dissenting work, and the missionary is made a by-word of opprobrium. I have
repeatedly had the doors and windows of my preaching places broken and wrecked. The priests
have incited the vulgar crowd to hoot and yell at me, and on these occasions I have been both
shot at and stoned.

In Cordoba, there is a very costly image of Mary. Once every year it is brought out into the
public square, while all the criminals from the state prison stand in line. By a move of her
head she is supposed to point out the one whom she thinks should be given his liberty.

From Goldsmith's "Rome" we learn that the vestal virgins possessed the power to pardon any
criminal whom they met on the road to execution. Thus does Romanism follow paganism. With the
Virgin is often the image of St. Peter. The followers of this saint affirm that they are always
warned, three days before they die, to prepare for death. St. Peter comes in person and knocks
on the wall beside their bed.

As the virgin, Diana, was the guardian of Ephesus, so the Virgin Mary protects Argentina.

The Bishop of Tucuman, in a recent speech, said: "Argentina is now safe against possible invasion.
The newly-crowned Lady of the Miracles defends the north, and the Lady of Lujan guards the south."

A writer in The Times of Argentina naively asks: "If these can safely defy and defeat all comers,
is there any further necessity for public expenditure in military matters?"

South America groans under the weight of a mediaeval religion which has little to do with spiritual
life. In Spain and Portugal, perhaps the two most deluded of European lands, I have seen great
darkness, but even there the priest is often good, and at least puts on a veneer of piety.
In South America this is not generally considered necessary. Frequently he is found to be the
worst man in the village. If you speak to him of his dissolute life, he may tell you that he,
being a priest, may do things you, a layman, must not. In Spain, Portugal and Italy, next door
to highly enlightened countries, the priest cannot, for very shame, act as he is free to do
in South America. That great continent has been ruled and governed only by Roman Catholics,
without outside interference, and Romanists in other lands do not, and would not, believe the
practices there sanctioned.

"You ask about this nation and the Roman Catholic Church," said the American Minister in one
South American capital. "Well, the nation is rotten, thanks to the Church and to Spain. The
Church has taught lies and uncleanness, and been the bulwark of injustice and wrong for 300
years. How could you expect anything else?" "Lies," said a priest to a friend, who told the
remark to us, "what do lies have to do with religion." [Footnote: "Missions In South America,"
Robt. E. Speer.]

A missionary writes: "Recently the Roman bishop and several other priests visited the various
towns. It was a business trip, for they charged a good price for baptisms, confirmations, etc.,
and carried away thousands of dollars. In Santa Cruz a disgraceful scene was publicly enacted
in the church by the resident priest and one of the visitors. Both saw a woman drop a twenty-five
cent piece into the pan; each grabbed for it, and then they fought before the people! The village
priest wanted me to take his photo, but he was so drunk I had to help him put on his official
robes. He was taken standing in the doorway of the church beside an image of the Virgin."

"There wan a feast in honor of the image of the Holy Spirit in the church. This is a figure
of a man with a beard; beside it sits a figure of Christ, and between them a dove. Great crowds
of people attend these feasts to buy, sell and drink. On a common in the town a large altar
was erected, and another image of the Holy Spirit placed, and before it danced Indians fantastically
dressed to represent monkeys, tigers, lions and deer. Saturday, Sunday and Monday were days
of debauchery. Men, women and children were intoxicated; the jails were full, and extravagances
of all kinds were practised by masked Indians. The vessels in the church are of gold and silver,
and the images each have a man to care for them. The patron saint is a large image of the Virgin,
dressed in clothing that cost $2,500."

Since returning to more civilized lands, I have been asked: But do they really worship the
Virgin, or God, through her? I answer that in enlightened countries where Roman Catholicism
prevails, the latter may be true, but that in South America, discovered and governed by Romanists
from the earliest times, millions of people worship the Virgin without any reference to God.
She is the great goddess of the people, and while one may see her image in every church, it
is seldom indeed that God is honored with a place--then He may be seen as an old man with a
long white beard. What kind of God they think He is may be seen from the words of Missionary
F. Glass: "I found a 'festa' in full swing, called the 'Feast of the Divine Eternal Father,'
and a drunken crowd were marching round, with trumpets, drums and a sacred banner, collecting
alms professedly on His behalf." [Footnote: "Through the Heart of Brazil"]

Mary is the one to whom the vast majority of people pray. They have been taught to address
supplications to her, and, being a woman, her heart is considered more tender than a man's
could be. During a drought their earnest prayer for rain was answered in an unexpected way,
for not only did she send it, but with such accompanying violence that it washed away the church!

In some churches the mail-box stands in a corner, and "Letters to the Virgin" is printed over
it. There are always many young women to be seen before the image of St. Anthony, for he is
the patron of marriages, and many a timid confession of love is dropped into the letter-box,
and it often happens that a marriage is arranged as a result. The superstitious maiden believes
that her letter goes directly to the Virgin or to the saint in his heavenly mansion, and she
has no suspicion that it is read by the parish priest.

Saints are innumerable and their powers extraordinary. When travelling in Entre Rios, I learned
that St. Ramon was an adept in guiding the path of the thunderbolt. A terrific storm swept
across the country, and a woman, afraid for her house, placed his image leaning against the
outside wall, that he might be able to see and direct the elements. The tempest raged, and
as though to show the saint's utter helplessness, the end of the house was struck by lightning
and set on fire. Little damage was done, but I smiled when the indignant woman, after the storm
ceased, soundly thrashed the image for not attending to its duty.

While preaching in the town of Quilmes, a poor deluded worshipper of Rome "turned from idols
to serve the living and true God." He had been a sincere believer in St. Nicolas, and implicitly
believed the absurd account of that saint having raised to life three children who had been
brutally murdered by their father and secreted in a barrel. He brought me a picture of this
wonder-worker tapping the barrel, and the little ones in the act of coming out alive and well.

One familiar with Romanism in South America has said: "It is amazing to hear men who have access
to the Word of God and the facts of history and of the actual state of the Romish world attempt
to apologize for or even defend Romanism. Romanism is not Christianity."

The Church deliberately lies about the Ten Commandments, entirely omitting the second and dividing
the tenth in order to make the requisite number. Can a Church which deceives the people teach
them true religion? Is the preaching of Mary the preaching of Christ? [Footnote: "Mission In
South America," Robert B. Speer.]

"There is not an essential truth which is not distorted, covered up, neutralized, poisoned,
and completely nullified by the doctrines of the Romish system." [Footnote: Bishop Neely's
"South America."]

A missionary in Cartago writes: "I must tell you about the annual procession of the wonderful
miracle-working image called 'Our Lady Queen of the Angels,' through the principal streets
of the town. Picture to yourselves, if you can, hundreds of people praying, worshipping, and
doing homage to this little stone idol, for which a special church has been built. To this
image many people come with their diseases, for she is supposed to have power to cure all.
On a special day of the procession, people receive pardon for particular sins if they only
carry out the bidding of 'Our Lady,' She seems to order some extraordinary things, such as
crawling in the streets with big rocks on the head after the procession, or painting one's
self all the colors of the rainbow. One man was painted black, while others wore wigs and beards
of a long parasitic grass which grows from the trees. Some were dressed in sackcloth, and all
were doing penance for some sin or crime. This little image was carried by priests, incense
was burned before her, and at intervals in the journey she was put on lovely altars, on which
sat little girls dressed in blue and green, with wings of white, representing angels. Some
weeks ago 'Our Lady' was carried through the streets to collect money for the bull-fights got
up in her honor. She is said to be very fond of these fights, which are immoral and full of
bloody cruelty. This year the bulls were to kill the men, or the men the bulls, and the awful
drunkenness I cannot describe. After this collection the bishop came over here, and is said
to have taken away some of the money. Soon after he died, and the people here say that 'Our
Lady' was angry with him."

From a recent list of prayers used in the Church of Rome I select the following expressions:

 "Queen of heaven and earth, Mother of God,
  my Sovereign Mistress, I present myself before
  you as a poor mendicant before a mighty Queen.

 "All is subject to Mary's empire, even God
  Himself. Jesus has rendered Mary omnipotent:
  the one is omnipotent by nature, the other
  omnipotent by grace.

 "You, O Holy Virgin, have over God the authority
  of a mother.

 "It is impossible that a true servant of Mary
  should be damned.

 "My soul is in the hands of Mary, so that if
  the Judge wishes to condemn me the sentence
  must pass through this clement Queen, and she
  knows how to prevent its execution.

 "We, Holy Virgin, hope for grace and salvation
  from you.

 "Dispensatrix of Divine Grace."

How history repeats itself! How hard paganism is to kill! The ancient Egyptians worshipped
the "Queen of Heaven." Jeremiah, as far back as 587 B.C., prophesied desolation to Judah for
having "burned incense to the Queen of Heaven," and poured out "drink offerings" unto her,
and "made cakes to worship her."--Jer. xliv. 17-19.

The South American version of Matthew 11:28, as may be seen carved on a stone of the Jesuit
Church in Cuzco, is: "Come to MARY, all you who are laden with works, and weary beneath the
weight of your sins, and she will alleviate you," A literal translation of one of the prayers
offered to her reads: "Yes, beloved Mother! of thee I supplicate all that is necessary for
the salvation of my soul. Of whom should I ask this grace but of Thee? To whom should a loving
son go but to his beloved Mother? To whom the weak sheep cry but to its divine shepherdess?
Whom seek the sick, but the celestial doctor? Whom invoke those in affliction but the mother
of consolation? Hear me then, Holy Queen!"

The statues of the "Queen of Heaven" are often of great magnificence, the dress of one which
I know having cost $2,000. In the poor Indian churches a bag of maize leaves, tied near the
top to make a neck, and above that an Indian physiognomy, painted with some vegetable dye,
serves the same purpose. The Bishop of La Serena, in Chili, has received as much as $40,000
a year for keeping up the revered image in that church, and these images are worshipped. Bequests
are often left to them, and a popular one will receive many legacies annually.

To be just, I must mention that in the arms of this "Mother of God" there is, almost invariably,
the child Jesus, but I must also state that to tens of thousands this baby never grew to manhood,
but went up to heaven in His mother's arms. What a caricature of Christianity! Paul said: "If
Christ be not risen, then is our preaching vain, and your faith is also vain." "Make Jesus
a perpetual child, and Mariolatry becomes lower than Chinese ancestral worship." If He, as
a child, was translated to heaven, then He never died and rose again. Mary is, to them, the
Saviour. The child Jesus happened to be her son, and, as she was the great divine one, He,
through her, partook of divinity. "please don'race arrive him made till thirtieth." That was all. Not
the sadness; not even hoec perfunctory "have painted" it is evidently
est earth sold to dampen such blows.

Thus, the reader sees, at the very commencement of God's Word, and in the very first promise
of a Saviour for fallen men, the eyes of seeking souls are turned by Romanists from the Creator
to the creature.

How these words are understood by Romanists is plainly seen by the pictures of Mary trampling
on the serpent, which are found everywhere in Romish lands.

Under pictures of the Virgin, circulated everywhere, are the words: "We have seen the star
and are come to adore her." The prayers of adoration run, "To the holiest birth of Mary, that
in death it may bring about our birth to eternal glory. Ave Maria!" "To the anguish of Mary,
that we may be made predestined children of her sorrows. Ave Maria!"

The veneration with which the Virgin Mary is regarded, and the power with which she is invested,
are thus told by many a priest: "Once God was so angry with the world that He determined to
destroy it, and was about to execute His design when Mary said to Him: 'Give me back first
the milk with which I fed you, and then you can do so!' In this way she averted the impending
destruction."

"Millions in Brazil look upon the Virgin Mary as their Saviour. A book widely circulated throughout
northern Brazil says that Mary, when still a mere child, went bodily to heaven and begged God
to send Christ, through her, into the world. Further on it says that Mary went again to heaven
to plead for sinners; and at the close Mary's will is given, disposing of the whole world,
and God the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit--the Trinity--act as the three witnesses to the will.
How many good Christians at home think Brazil is a Christian country?" [Footnote: W. C. Porter.]

If the Bible were in circulation throughout South America, the populace would be enabled to
see that Christ is not the remorseless Judge but the loving Saviour, and that it was He who
purchased redemption for us. Mary, according to Luke 1:47, was herself in need of a Saviour,
and her only recorded command was to do as He, the Christ, enjoined (See John 2:5). Not only
Protestants, but not even Roman Catholics born in Protestant countries, can understand what
Romanism is in South America.

Christ said: "Search the Scriptures." Rome has done her best to destroy the sacred volume.
Papal bulls, said to have been dictated by the Holy Ghost, have been issued by several Popes.
Rome sometimes burned the martyrs with a Bible hanging around their necks. Romanists showed
their hatred against Wycliffe, the first translator of the New Testament into English, by unearthing
his crumbling remains and burning them to ashes. I have often seen the same spirit shown in
South America.

A colporteur, writing of Scripture circulation in the Argentine, says: "Many of the people
are trying to get us ejected from the city. One, to whom a Bible was offered, became so infuriated
that he said: 'If it were not such a public place? I would drown you in the river.'" A missionary
writes: "A young fellow called out after me, 'I renounce you, Satan,' but as that is not my
name, I did not turn back. During the meeting on Sunday evening, the priest came riding up
to the window, and shouted that he would soon put a stop to us. Today he has had a number of
bills printed, warning his parishioners to have nothing to do with us. To-night one of the
bills was pasted on the door. Br. Arena took it off, and no sooner had he the door shut than
two shots were fired, but they did no more harm than to pierce the door--thank God! I have
been informed that a number of young men will either beat or shoot me, and that as I am the
only one left they are going to make me leave, too, by foul or by fair means. The following
is a translation of the priest's warning:

  "To the faithful of Candelaria. Beware.
  This parish has been invaded by one of the
  wicked sects of Protestantism, and, having the
  sacred duty of warning my parishioners, I give
  them to understand that should any one of
  them attend, even from mere curiosity, to hear
  the false and pernicious propaganda, or accept
  tracts or books that come from the propagators
  of Protestantism, he will be excommunicated
  from the true and only Church of Jesus Christ,
  Catholic, Apostolic, and Roman, wherein resides
  the infallible authority. Beware, then, oh, ye
  faithful, and listen to your parish priest, who
  advises you of the danger of your souls."

Yet with all this darkness and error, the majority are well contented, and quite willing to
obey "warnings" like this and the following, published in Los Principios, of Cordoba:

  "It has come to our knowledge that there are
  amongst us various Protestant ministers, that
  distribute with profusion leaflets containing their
  erroneous doctrines and calumnies against the
  Catholic Church. Some of these leaflets and booklets
  have fallen into our hands, and in them we
  have found confirmation of what we say above.
  In one of these leaflets, for example, they treat
  as idolatry the worship that we Catholics tribute
  to the Mother of God. They treat as superstition
  the veneration they have in Rome for the holy
  staircase by which our Lord Jesus Christ went
  up to the judgment hall of Pilate. They combat
  the worship of images, relics, and things of that
  description.

  "Catholics ought to know that it is not lawful
  for them to read these leaflets, nor the Sacred
  Bible distributed by the Protestants, because it
  has been falsified by them, accommodating its
  texts to their errors. The Church has prohibited
  its children many times these pernicious readings.
  Let us reject, according to the counsel
  of St. Paul, these ravenous wolves that come in
  sheep's clothing, for they come to kill and to
  destroy souls, thrusting them into the ways of
  error, being separated from the true Church of
  Jesus Christ, from which Luther, Calvin,
  Zuinglio, Henry VIII, and others separated
  themselves, of whom Cobbell, the Protestant
  historian, himself has said: 'Never has the
  world seem gathered into one century so many
  perverse men as Luther, Zuiniglio, Calvin,' etc."

One acquainted with Spanish-American Romanism will smile at the reference in the above article
to the Bible having been falsified by us. If the text of any version extant is compared with
those which are painted on the walls of the church in Celaya, there surely will be found a
great discrepancy. The following are translations:

"MARY, my mother, in thee I hope; save me from those that persecute me."--Psalm vii. 1.

"Be thou exalted, O MARY, above the heavens, and thy glory above all the earth."--Psalm lvii. 5.

'I will sing to MARY while I live."--Psalm civ. 33.

"Serve MARY with love, and rejoice in her with trembling."--Psalm ii. 11.

"Offer sacrifices of righteousness and trust in MARY."--Psalm iv. 5.

"Let everything that hath breath praise OUR LADY," etc., etc.

Protestant Christians pay almost all the entire cost of circulating Roman Catholic translations
of the Scriptures over the world. In the versions of De Saci (French), Martini (Italian), Scio
(Spanish), Pereira (Portuguese), and Wuyka (Polish), we find in Matthew 3: 2, and thirty-four
other places, instead of "repent ye" the words, "do penance," while in Matthew 3: 8, and some
twenty other places, the word that should be translated "repentance," is rendered penance.
In the following light way "penance" can be done, while "repentance" is not thought of.

For sins against the Church the priest will often condemn the culprit to wear a hideous garment
for hours, or days, according to the gravity of the offence, but this punishment can be worn
by proxy. There are always those who, for a consideration, will don the badge of disgrace.

What is called "Holy Week" gives proofs of the shallowness of Rome's piety. Priests and people
alike can weep, fast and faint, because their God is suffering and dying; all traffic can stop
because, they say, "God has died"; but as soon as the death of Judas is announced, at noon
on Saturday, the noise of guns, pistols, squibs, etc., takes the place of the death-like quiet
that had reigned. After an hour or two silence again prevails till Sunday morning, when all
restraint is removed, and people seem to make up for lost time. Drinking and kindred evils
run riot, and it is no uncommon thing on the Sunday night to see the people drinking and dancing
by the light of the candles they were burning to their favorite virgin or saint.

In the large city of Lima, for centuries a very stronghold of image worship, the interest in
the Church has of late years been waning. Perhaps one reason for this is the changing nature
of the native population of the city, for the deaths there exceed the births. Seeing this falling
away from the Church, the priests announced that they had decided to send for the Sacred Heart
of the Virgin, and trusted that the presence of this holy relic would promote the more faithful
attendance of the flock. The heart arrived and was with great solemnity hung from the roof
of the cathedral as the incentive to piety. Thousands flocked into the sacred building with
reverent awe. The women gazed upon the heart with tearful eyes, and as they thought of Mary's
sufferings and goodness they were emulated to deeper acts of love and piety. One day the wind
blew very strongly through the open doorway, and the Sacred Heart began to sway to and fro.
Getting more and more momentum with every oscillation, the heart finally struck against a sharp
cornice, when lo--all the sawdust fell out of the canvas bag they had worshipped as the heart
of flesh of their goddess. How they reconciled the existence of the heart of the Virgin with
their belief that she ascended to heaven in a bodily form I do not pretend to imagine. It may
be remarked that this is surely Romanism corrupted. Nay, it is rather Romanism developed.

"Andacilli is a hamlet, at which there is an image of the Virgin. Every year pilgrims resort
thither, and a great feast to the Virgin is celebrated, the most important day being December
26th. During the last few years there has been a falling off in the number of pilgrims, especially
those of the better class, but this last year the clerical authorities have left no stone unturned
in order to get together more people than ever. Six bishops were advertised to come, and they
were to crown the Virgin with a crown which cost thousands of dollars. These proceedings rouse
an incredible enthusiasm in the people." [Footnote: "Regions Beyond."]

Sometimes Mary's image is baptized in the river, while men and women line the bank, ready to
leap into the holy water when she is lifted out. "i buy it only intently at the Bakery; and-- yes-- brine excavation
is so done for!" she do.

 Here, once a year, a priest celebrates
mass, and when he last came he stuck a paper over the entrance, which read: Hoec est Domus
Del et Porta Coeli (' This is the House of God and the Gate of Heaven.') In San Jose we have
the four walls of a new church, consecrated to the 'Virgin,' where, recently, a raffle was
held on behalf of the projected edifice. As we enter, the first thing seen is an inscription,
professing to be a message to each visitor from the Virgin, which says, 'My son, behold me
without a temple. Come, help in building it, and I shall reward thee with Eternal Life." [Footnote:
Report of the British and Foreign Bible Society.]

Christ said: "I give unto My sheep eternal life"; but the record of that saying is jealously
kept from them.

When the early colonists left Spain for the New World, they took with them the Creed of Pius
IV. That creed expressly states that the Bible is not for the people. "Whoever will be saved
must renounce it. It is a forbidden book."

"In 1850, when the Christian world was first being roused to the darkness of South America,
and philanthropic men were desirous of sending Bibles there, Pope Pius IX. wrote an Encyclical
letter in which he spoke of Bible study as 'poisonous reading,' and urged all his venerable
brethren with vigilance and solicitude to put a stop to it. "again... perhaps not to boat." This

not travel with? " Without
the enlightening influences of that Word, behold the darkness! Could anything be more eloquent
than the prosperity of the land of the Pilgrim Fathers in proclaiming the value of the open Bible?

Mr. Hudson Taylor, of the China Inland Mission, speaking on a recent occasion, said: "I always
pray for South America. It is a most needy part of the world, and wants your prayers as well
as mine. The workers there have great difficulties to contend with, and of the same sort as
we have in China, from Roman Catholicism--the most God- dishonoring system in the world. The
heathen need your prayers, but the Roman Catholic needs them ten times more. He is ten times
as much in the dark as the heathen themselves are."

The Missionary Review of the World describes South America as "Earth's darkest land." Do you
not think, O reader, the words are most truly applied?

"There are in South America eight hundred missionaries, men and women, from Great Britain,
the Continent of Europe, Canada and the United States. In Canada and the United States there
is on an average one Protestant minister for every 514 persons. In South America each missionary
has a constituency of about fifty thousand, indicating a need in proportion of population one
hundred times as great as in the Protestant countries of North America." [Footnote: Bishop
Neely's "South America."]

Yet, One called Jesus, whom we say we love, said: "Go ye into all the world and preach the
Gospel to every creature."
