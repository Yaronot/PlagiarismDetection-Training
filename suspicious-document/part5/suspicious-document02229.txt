"I don't say Thomas and I haven't missed a lot, I'm not belittling youth and its love and its
hopes.  But I do say that I wouldn't change this last year of my life for any that might have
been.  Why, when I wake up in the morning, my head's full of the children, thinking of 'em
and planning for 'em and sometimes worrying about 'em.  It needs a little tart taste, sometimes,
to bring out the sweet.  Thomas and I have spent hours, trying to decide whether we'll make
a doctor out of Algie, or a civil engineer, and we know both of us, that when the time comes,
he'll take the bit in his teeth and do as he likes.  Only it's such fun planning it out.  When
I look back five years or ten, or twenty, for that matter, and see how my life has filled up
and widened out, I feel real sorry for that little, young, silly Persis Dale who thought she
was so happy and knew so little about it.  If life takes with one hand, Mis' Sinclair, it gives
with two, only you'll never find it out as long as you grip tight to what you've got."

She looked down on the bundle in her arms, and again her face was irradiated by a vivid tenderness,
almost as if she had been mother of the child.

"Now, here's a case in point, Annabel Sinclair.  Right here in my arms is a little lump of
joy that ought to fill up your cup of happiness so full that it would spill over.  Seems to
me if this little mite belonged to me, if I knew my blood was in his veins, this town wouldn't
be big enough to hold me.  I love my five, dear knows, but there's a hurt in thinking that
I'm never going to see the Dale stubbornness cropping out or any of the Hardin ways.  But you
haven't got that little nagging hurt to take off your joy, like a pinch in a pair of new shoes.
It's all along of you that this boy's here."

As if dominated by the stronger will, Annabel's eyes turned toward the bundle.  And inwardly
praying that this was the moment for her coup d'état, Persis started to her feet.

"I b'lieve that's Thad calling.  'Fraid like as not, that I'm going to kidnap his son and heir.
You hold the baby, Mis' Sinclair, till I see what's wanted."

She had tucked the baby into the curve of his grandmother's arm before Annabel could protest,
and she left the room without looking back. Annabel, breathing fast, stared down into the little
red face against her shoulder. Quitted scene-- literary lips cry tentatively for two-thirds. Wife
her was poking piano her opened herself as seat, and play with eyes. There now, one think

Arrange
queer eyes to turn as drive. She had not dreamed that there could be such tenacity in those wee
fingers.  It was uncanny to be thus gripped by a creature so intensely new.  And Persis had
said that this was one of Heaven's good gifts, a joy that might brim life's cup over.

The door opened and she raised her eyes.  Her husband stood there, gravely intent.  She had
never looked less beautiful than in her pale disorder, but the pathos of her drooping figure
and bewildered face touched him strangely.  Or perhaps it was the child in her arms.

"It's holding to my finger, Stanley!  See!"  Annabel's features twisted in a strange distorted
smile.  "Our little grandchild."

He moved nearer.  For all his efforts, he found it impossible to make his voice altogether
matter-of-fact.

"You've had a hard day, I'm sure.  You'd better speak to Diantha and then let me take you home."

She rose to her feet unsteadily, holding the child with the peculiar awkwardness of the woman
in whom the maternal instinct is lacking.  But as she passed on before him, her husband saw
that the tiny hand still curled tendril-like about her finger.
