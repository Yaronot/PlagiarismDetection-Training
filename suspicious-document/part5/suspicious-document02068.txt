This silence lasted more than a quarter of an hour.  The King broke it as he leaned upon a
balustrade to speak of a carp.  Nobody replied.  He addressed himself afterwards on the subject
of these carps to domestics, who did not ordinarily join in the conversation.  Nothing but
carps was spoken of with them.  All was languishing, and the King went away some time after.

  Desmarets no longer knew of what wood to make a crutch.
He had been to Paris knocking at every door.  But the most exact engagements had been so often
broken that he found nothing but excuses and closed doors.  Bernard, like the rest, would advance
nothing.  Much was due to him.  In vain Desmarets represented to him the pressing necessity
for money, and the enormous gains he had made out of the King.  Bernard remained unshakeable.
The King and the minister were cruelly embarrassed.  Desmarets said to the King that, after
all was said and done, only Samuel Bernard could draw them out of the mess, because it was
not doubtful that he had plenty of money everywhere; that the only thing needed was to vanquish
his determination and the obstinacy--even insolence--he had shown; that he was a man crazy
with vanity, and capable of opening his purse if the King deigned to flatter him.

It was agreed, therefore, that Desmarets should invite Bernard to dinner --should walk with
him--and that the King should come and disturb them as I have related.  Bernard was the dupe
of this scheme; he returned from his walk with the King enchanted to such an extent that he
said he would prefer ruining himself rather than leave in embarrassment a Prince who had just
treated him so graciously, and whose eulogiums he uttered with enthusiasm!  Desmarets profited
by this trick immediately, and drew much more from it than he had proposed to himself..

The Prince de Leon had an adventure just about this time, which made much noise.  He was a
great, ugly, idle, mischievous fellow, son of the Duc de Rohan, who had given him the title
I have just named.  He had served in one campaign very indolently, and then quitted the army,
under pretence of ill-health, to serve no more.  Glib in speech, and with the manners of the
great world, he was full of caprices and fancies; although a great gambler and spendthrift,
he was miserly, and cared only for himself.  He had been enamoured of Florence, an actress,
whom M. d'Orleans had for a long time kept, and by whom he had children, one of whom is now
Archbishop of Cambrai.  M. de Leon also had several children by this creature, and spent large
sums upon her.  When he went in place of his father to open the States of Brittany, she accompanied
him in a coach and six horses, with a ridiculous scandal.  His father was in agony lest he
should marry her.  He offered to insure her five thousand francs a-year pension, and to take
care of their children, if M. de Leon would quit her.  But M. de Leon would not hear of this,
and his father accordingly complained to the King.  The King summoned M. de Leon into his cabinet;
but the young man pleaded his cause so well there, that he gained pity rather than condemnation.
Nevertheless, La Florence was carried away from a pretty little house at the Ternes, near Paris,
where M. de Leon kept her, and was put in a convent.  M. de Leon became furious; for some time
he would neither see nor speak of his father or mother, and repulsed all idea of marriage.

At last, however, no longer hoping to see his actress, he not only consented, but wished to
marry.  His parents were delighted at this, and at once looked about for a wife for him.  Their
choice, fell upon the eldest daughter of the Duc de Roquelaure, who, although humpbacked and
extremely ugly, she was to be very rich some day, and was, in fact, a very good match.  The
affair had been arranged and concluded up to a certain point, when all was broken off, in consequence
of the haughty obstinacy with which the Duchesse de Roquelaure demanded a larger sum with M.
de Leon than M. de Rohan chose to give.

The young couple were in despair: M. de Leon, lest his father should always act in this way,
as an excuse for giving him nothing; the young lady, because she, feared she should rot in
a convent, through the avarice of her mother, and never marry.  She was more than twenty-four
years, of age; he was more than eight-and-twenty.  She was in the convent of the Daughters
of the Cross in the Faubourg Saint Antoine.

Early in July, we took Ghent and Bruges by surprise, and the news of these successes was received
with the most unbridled joy at Fontainebleau.  It appeared easy to profit by these two conquests,
obtained without difficulty, by passing the Escaut, burning Oudenarde, closing the country
to the enemies, and cutting them off from all supplies.  Ours were very abundant, and came
by water, with a camp that could not be attacked.  M. de Vendome agreed to all this; and alleged
nothing against it.  There was only one difficulty in the way; his idleness and unwillingness
to move from quarters where he was comfortable.  He wished to enjoy those quarters as long
as possible, and maintained, therefore, that these movements would be just as good if delayed.
Monseigneur le Duc de Bourgogne maintained on the contrary, with all the army--even the favourites
of M. de Vendome--that it would be better to execute the operation at once, that there was
no reason for delay, and that delay might prove disastrous.  He argued in vain. Vendome disliked
fatigue and change of quarters.  They interfered with the daily life he was accustomed to lead,
and which I have elsewhere described.  He would not move.
