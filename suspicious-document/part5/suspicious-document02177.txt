 Platon, the celebrated metropolitan of Kiew, thought that my discovery was of great importance.
Nevertheless, he sought to dissuade me from publishing the memoirs, believing that their publication
could only hurt me. "Why?" This the venerable prelate refused to tell me more explicitly. Nevertheless,
since our conversation took place in Russia, where the censor would have put his veto upon
such a work, I made up my mind to wait.

A year later, I found myself in Rome. I showed my manuscript to a cardinal very near to the
Holy Father, who answered me literally in these words:--"What good will it do to print this?
Nobody will attach to it any great importance and you will create a number of enemies. But,
you are still very young! If it is a question of money which concerns you, I can ask for you
a reward for your notes, a sum which will repay your expenditures and recompense you for your
loss of time." Of course, I refused.

In Paris I spoke of my project to Cardinal Rotelli, whose acquaintance I had made in Constantinople.
He, too, was opposed to having my work printed, under the pretext that it would be premature.
"The church," he added, "suffers already too much from the new current of atheistic ideas,
and you will but give a new food to the calumniators and detractors of the evangelical doctrine.
I tell you this in the interest of all the Christian churches."

Then I went to see M. Jules Simon. He found my matter very interesting and advised me to ask
the opinion of M. Renan, as to the best way of publishing these memoirs. The should be done at

 The banks of the river are now lined with boat-houses, long and narrow,
which the proprietors, with their families, inhabit the whole year.

From here Srinagar can be reached in one day's travel on horseback; but with a boat the journey
requires a day and a half. I chose the latter mode of conveyance, and having selected a boat
and bargained with its proprietor for its hire, took my seat in the bow, upon a carpet, sheltered
by a sort of penthouse roof. The boat left the shore at midnight, bearing us rapidly toward
Srinagar. At the stern of the bark, a Hindu prepared my tea. I went to sleep, happy in knowing
my voyage was to be accomplished. The hot caress of the sun's rays penetrating my little roof
awakened me, and what I experienced delighted me beyond all expression. Entirely green banks;
the distant outlines of mountain tops covered with snow; pretty villages which from time to
time showed themselves at the mountain's foot; the crystalline sheet of water; pure and peculiarly
agreeable air, which I breathed with exhilaration; the musical carols of an infinity of birds;
a sky of extraordinary purity; behind me the plash of water stirred by the round-ended paddle
which was wielded with ease by a superb woman (with marvellous eyes and a complexion browned
by the sun), who wore an air of stately indifference: all these things together seemed to plunge
me into an ecstasy, and I forgot entirely the reason for my presence on the river. In that
moment I had not even a desire to reach the end of my voyage--and yet, how many privations
remained for me to undergo, and dangers to encounter! I felt myself here so well content!

The boat glided rapidly and the landscape continued to unfold new beauties before my eyes,
losing itself in ever new combinations with the horizon, which merged into the mountains we
were passing, to become one with them. Then a new panorama would display itself, seeming to
expand and flow out from the sides of the mountains, becoming more and more grand.... The day
was almost spent and I was not yet weary of contemplating this magnificent nature, the view
of which reawakened the souvenirs of childhood and youth. How beautiful were those days forever
gone!

The more nearly one approaches Srinagar, the more numerous become the villages embowered in
the verdure. At the approach of our boat, some of their inhabitants came running to see us;
the men in their turbans, the women in their small bonnets, both alike dressed in white gowns
reaching to the ground, the children in a state of nudity which reminded one of the costumes
of our first parents.

When entering the city one sees a range of barks and floating houses in which entire families
reside. The tops of the far-off, snow-covered mountains were caressed by the last rays of the
setting sun, when we glided between the wooden houses of Srinagar, which closely line both
banks of the river. Life seems to cease here at sunset; the thousands of many colored open
boats (dunga) and palanquin-covered barks (bangla) were fastened along the beach; men and women
gathered near the river, in the primitive costumes of Adam and Eve, going through their evening
ablutions without feeling any embarrassment or prudery before each other, since they performed
a religious rite, the importance of which is greater for them than all human prejudices.

On the 20^th of October I awoke in a neat room, from which I had a gay view upon the river
that was now inundated with the rays of the sun of Kachmyr. As it is not my purpose to describe
here my experiences in detail, I refrain from enumerating the lovely valleys, the paradise
of lakes, the enchanting islands, those historic places, mysterious pagodas, and coquettish
villages which seem lost in vast gardens; on all sides of which rise the majestic tops of the
giants of the Himalaya, shrouded as far as the eye can see in eternal snow. I shall only note
the preparations I made in view of my journey toward Thibet. I spent six days at Srinagar,
making long excursions into the enchanting surroundings of the city, examining the numerous
ruins which testify to the ancient prosperity of this region, and studying the strange customs
of the country.

       *       *       *       *       *

Kachmyr, as well as the other provinces attached to it, Baltistan, Ladak, etc., are vassals
of England. They formerly formed part of the possessions of Randjid Sing, the Lion of the Pendjab.
At his death, the English troops occupied Lahore, the capital of the Pendjab, separated Kachmyr
from the rest of the empire and ceded it, under color of hereditary right, and for the sum
of 160,000,000 francs, to Goulab-Sing, one of the familiars of the late sovereign, conferring
on him besides the title of Maharadja. At the epoch of my journey, the actual Maharadja was
Pertab-Sing, the grandchild of Goulab, whose residence is Jamoo, on the southern slope of the
Himalaya.

The celebrated "happy valley" of Kachmyr (eighty-five miles long by twenty-five miles wide)
enjoyed glory and prosperity only under the Grand Mogul, whose court loved to taste here the
sweetness of country life, in the still existent pavilions on the little island of the lake.
Most of the Maharadjas of Hindustan used formerly to spend here the summer months, and to take
part in the magnificent festivals given by the Grand Mogul; but times have greatly changed
since, and the happy valley is today no more than a beggar retreat. Aquatic plants and scum
have covered the clear waters of the lake; the wild juniper has smothered all the vegetation
of the islands; the palaces and pavilions retain only the souvenir of their past grandeur;
earth and grass cover the buildings which are now falling in ruins. The surrounding mountains
and their eternally white tops seem to be absorbed in a sullen sadness, and to nourish the
hope of a better time for the disclosure of their immortal beauties. The once spiritual, beautiful
and cleanly inhabitants have grown animalistic and stupid; they have become dirty and lazy;
and the whip now governs them, instead of the sword.

The people of Kachmyr have so often been subject to invasions and pillages and have had so
many masters, that they have now become indifferent to every thing. They pass their time near
the banks of the rivers, gossiping about their neighbors; or are engaged in the painstaking
work of making their celebrated shawls; or in the execution of filagree gold or silver work.
The Kachmyr women are of a melancholy temperament, and an inconceivable sadness is spread upon
their features. Everywhere reigns misery and uncleanness. The beautiful men and superb women
of Kachmyr are dirty and in rags. The costume of the two sexes consists, winter and summer
alike, of a long shirt, or gown, made of thick material and with puffed sleeves. They wear
this shirt until it is completely worn out, and never is it washed, so that the white turban
of the men looks like dazzling snow near their dirty shirts, which are covered all over with
spittle and grease stains.

The traveller feels himself permeated with sadness at seeing the contrast between the rich
and opulent nature surrounding them, and this people dressed in rags.

The capital of the country, Srinagar (City of the Sun), or, to call it by the name which is
given to it here after the country, Kachmyr, is situated on the shore of the Djeloum, along
which it stretches out toward the south to a distance of five kilometres and is not more than
two kilometres in breadth.

 How could it be otherwise, since each woman
in this country has, on an average, three to five husbands, and possesses them in the most
legitimate way in the world. Polyandry flourishes here. However large a family may be, there
is but one woman in it. If the family does not contain already more than two husbands, a bachelor
may share its advantages, for a consideration. The days sacred to each one of those husbands
are determined in advance, and all acquit themselves of their respective duties and respect
each others' rights. The men generally seem feeble, with bent backs, and do not live to old
age. During my travels in Ladak, I only encountered one man so old that his hair was white.

From Karghil to the centre of Ladak, the road had a more cheerful aspect than that I had traversed
before reaching Karghil, its prospect being brightened by a number of little hamlets, but trees
and verdure were, unfortunately, rare.

Twenty miles from Karghil, at the end of the defile formed by the rapid current of the Wakkha,
is a little village called Chargol, in the centre of which stand three chapels, decorated with
lively colors (t'horthenes, to give them the name they bear in Thibet). Below, near the river,
are masses of rocks, in the form of long and large walls, upon which are thrown, in apparent
disorder, flat stones of different colors and sizes. Upon these stones are engraved all sorts
of prayers, in Ourd, Sanscrit and Thibetan, and one can even find among them inscriptions in
Arabic characters. Without the knowledge of my carriers, I succeeded in taking away a few of
these stones, which are now in the palace of the Trocadero.

Along the way, from Chargol, one finds frequently oblong mounds, artificial constructions.
After sunrise, with fresh horses, I resumed my journey and stopped near the gonpa (monastery)
of Moulbek, which seems glued on the flank of an isolated rock. Below is the hamlet of Wakkha,
and not far from there is to be seen another rock, of very strange form, which seems to have
been placed where it stands by human hands. In one side of it is cut a Buddha several metres
in height. Upon it are several cylinders, the turning of which serves for prayers. They are
a sort of wooden barrel, draped with yellow or white fabrics, and are attached to vertically
planted stakes. It requires only the least wind to make them turn. The person who puts up one
of these cylinders no longer feels it obligatory upon him to say his prayers, for all that
devout believers can ask of God is written upon the cylinders. Seen from a distance this white
painted monastery, standing sharply out from the gray background of the rocks, with all these
whirling, petticoated wheels, produce a strange effect in this dead country. I left my horses
in the hamlet of Wakkha, and, followed by my servant, walked toward the convent, which is reached
by a narrow stairway cut in the rock. At the top, I was received by a very fat lama, with a
scanty, straggling beard under his chin--a common characteristic of the Thibetan people--who
was very ugly, but very cordial. His costume consisted of a yellow robe and a sort of big nightcap,
with projecting flaps above the ears, of the same color. He held in his hand a copper prayer-machine
which, from time to time, he shook with his left hand, without at all permitting that exercise
to interfere with his conversation. It was his eternal prayer, which he thus communicated to
the wind, so that by this element it should be borne to Heaven. We traversed a suite of low
chambers, upon the walls of which were images of Buddha, of all sizes and made of all kinds
of materials, all alike covered by a thick layer of dust. Whence blackwood'me ran lama visited lama Magazine concerning notes.*****

 "Issa," he finally replied,
"is a great prophet, one of the first after the twenty-two Buddhas. He is greater than any
one of all the Dalai-Lamas, for he constitutes part of the spirituality of our Lord. It is
he who has instructed you; he who brought back into the bosom of God the frivolous and wicked
souls; he who made you worthy of the beneficence of the Creator, who has ordained that each
being should know good and evil. His name and his acts have been chronicled in our sacred writings,
and when reading how his great life passed away in the midst of an erring people, we weep for
the horrible sin of the heathen who murdered him, after subjecting him to torture."

I was struck by this recital of the lama. The prophet Issa--his tortures and death--our Christian
Dalai-Lama--the Buddhist recognizing Christianity--all these made me think more and more of
Jesus Christ. I asked my interpreter not to lose a single word of what the lama told me.

"Where can those writings be found, and who compiled them?" I asked the monk.

"The principal scrolls--which were written in India and Nepaul, at different epochs, as the
events happened--are in Lhassa; several thousands in number. In some great convents are to
be found copies, which the lamas, during their sojourn in Lhassa, have made, at various times,
and have then given to their cloisters as souvenirs of the period they spent with the Dalai-Lama."

"But you, yourselves; do you not possess copies of the scrolls bearing upon the prophet Issa?"

"We have not. Our convent is insignificant, and since its foundation our successive lamas have
had only a few hundred manuscripts in their library. The great cloisters have several thousands
of them; but they are sacred things which will not, anywhere, be shown to you."

We spoke together a few minutes longer, after which I went home, all the while thinking of
the lama's statements. Issa, a prophet of the Buddhists! But, how could this be? Boy and could

They also harvest barley, which they pulverize before selling. When work in the field is ended,
all male inhabitants go to gather on the mountain a wild herb called "enoriota," and large
thorn bushes or "dama," which are used as fuel, since combustibles are scarce in Ladak. You
see there neither trees nor gardens, and only exceptionally thin clumps of willows and poplars
grow on the shores of the rivers. Near the villages are also found some aspen trees; but, on
account of the unfertility of the ground, arboriculture is unknown and gardening is little
successful.

The absence of wood is especially noticeable in the buildings, which are made of sun-dried
bricks, or, more frequently, of stones of medium size which are agglomerated with a kind of
mortar composed of clay and chopped straw. The houses of the settled inhabitants are two stories
high, their fronts whitewashed, and their window-sashes painted with lively colors. The flat
roof forms a terrace which is decorated with wild flowers, and here, during good weather, the
inhabitants spend much of their time contemplating nature, or turning their prayer-wheels.
Every dwelling-house is composed of many rooms; among them always one of superior size, the
walls of which are decorated with superb fur-skins, and which is reserved for visitors. In
the other rooms are beds and other furniture. Rich people possess, moreover, a special room
filled with all kinds of idols, and set apart as a place of worship.

Life here is very regular. They eat anything attainable, without much choice; the principal
nourishment of the Ladak people, however, being exceedingly simple. Their breakfast consists
of a piece of rye bread. At dinner, they serve on the table a bowl with meal into which lukewarm
water is stirred with little rods until the mixture assumes the consistency of thick paste.
From this, small portions are scooped out and eaten with milk. In the evening, bread and tea
are served. Meat is a superfluous luxury. Only the hunters introduce some variety in their
alimentation, by eating the meat of wild sheep, eagles or pheasants, which are very common
in this country.

During the day, on every excuse and opportunity, they drink "tchang," a kind of pale, unfermented
beer.

If it happens that a Ladakian, mounted on a pony (such privileged people are very rare), goes
to seek work in the surrounding country, he provides himself with a small stock of meal; when
dinner time comes, he descends to a river or spring, mixes with water, in a wooden cup that
he always has with him, some of the meal, swallows the simple refreshment and washes it down
with water.

The Tchampas, or nomads, who constitute the other part of Ladak's population, are rougher,
and much poorer than the settled population. They are, for the most part, hunters, who completely
neglect agriculture. Although they profess the Buddhistic religion, they never frequent the
cloisters unless in want of meal, which they obtain in exchange for their venison. They mostly
camp in tents on the summits of the mountains, where the cold is very great. While the properly
called Ladakians are peaceable, very desirous of learning, of an incarnated laziness, and are
never known to tell untruth; the Tchampas, on the contrary, are very irascible, extremely lively,
great liars and profess a great disdain for the convents.

Among them lives the small population of Khombas, wanderers from the vicinity of Lhassa, who
lead the miserable existence of a troupe of begging gipsies on the highways. Incapable of any
work whatever, speaking a language not spoken in the country where they beg for their subsistence,
they are the objects of general contempt, and are only tolerated out of pity for their deplorable
condition, when hunger drives their mendicant bands to seek alms in the villages.

Polyandry, which is universally prevalent here, of course interested my curiosity. This institution
is, by the way, not the outcome of Buddha's doctrines. Polyandry existed long before the advent
of Buddha. It assumed considerable proportions in India, where it constituted one of the most
effective means for checking the growth of a population which tends to constant increase, an
economic danger which is even yet combatted by the abominable custom of killing newborn female
children, which causes terrible ravages in the child-life of India. The efforts made by the
English in their enactments against the suppression of the future mothers have proved futile
and fruitless. Manu himself established polyandry as a law, and Buddhist preachers, who had
renounced Brahminism and preached the use of opium, imported this custom into Ceylon, Thibet,
Corea, and the country of the Moguls. For a long time suppressed in China, polyandry, which
flourishes in Thibet and Ceylon, is also met with among the Kalmonks, between Todas in Southern
India, and Nairs on the coast of Malabar. Traces of this strange constitution of the family
are also to be found with the Tasmanians and the Irquois Indians in North America.

In view of all this it is impossible to hold any religion responsible for the existence of
the institution of polyandry. In Thibet it can be explained by motives of an economical nature;
the small quantity of arable land falling to the share of each inhabitant. In order to support
the 1,500,000 inhabitants distributed in Thibet, upon a surface of 1,200,000 square kilometres,
the Buddhists were forced to adopt polyandry. Moreover, each family is bound to enter one of
its members in a religious order. The firstborn is consecrated to a gonpa, which is inevitably
found upon an elevation, at the entrance of every village. As soon as the child attains the
age of eighteen years, he is entrusted to the caravans which pass Lhassa, where he remains
from eight to fifteen years as a novice, in one of the gonpas which are near the city. There
he learns to read and write, is taught the religious rites and studies the sacred parchments
written in the Pali language--which formerly used to be the language of the country of Maguada,
where, according to tradition, Buddha was born.

The oldest brother remaining in a family chooses a wife, who becomes common to his brothers.
The choice of the bride and the nuptial ceremonies are most rudimentary. When a wife and her
husband have decided upon the marriage of a son, the brother who possesses the right of choice,
pays a visit to a neighboring family in which there is a marriageable daughter.

The first and second visits are spent in more or less indifferent conversations, blended with
frequent libations of tchang, and on the third visit only does the young man declare his intention
to take a wife. Upon this the girl is formally introduced to him. She is generally not unknown
to the wooer, as, in Ladak, women never veil their faces.

A girl cannot be married without her consent. When the young man is accepted, he takes his
bride to his house, and she becomes his wife and also the wife of all his brothers. A family
which has an only son sends him to a woman who has no more than two or three husbands, and
he offers himself to her as a fourth husband. Such an offer is seldom declined, and the young
man settles in the new family.

The newly married remain with the parents of the husbands, until the young wife bears her first
child. The day after that event, the grandparents of the infant make over the bulk of their
fortune to the new family, and, abandoning the old home to them, seek other shelter.

Sometimes marriages are contracted between youth who have not reached a marriageable age, but
in such event, the married couple are made to live apart, until they have attained and even
passed the age required. An unmarried girl who becomes enceinte, far from being exposed to
the scorn of every one, is shown the highest respect; for she is demonstrated fruitful, and
men eagerly seek her in marriage. A wife has the unquestioned right of having an unlimited
number of husbands and lovers. If she likes a young man, she takes him home, announces that
he has been chosen by her as a "jingtuh" It, happening, of device, test, have demonstrated that the

"As I have told you," replied the lama to my interruption, "man will always be in childhood.
He sees and feels the grandeur of nature and understands everything presented to his senses,
but he neither sees nor divines the Great Soul which created and animates all things. Man has
always sought for tangible things. It was not possible for him to believe long in that which
escaped his material senses. He has racked his brain for any means for contemplating the Creator;
has endeavored to enter into direct relations with him who has done him so much good, and also,
as he erroneously believes, so much evil. For this reason he began to adore every phase of
nature from which he received benefits. We see a striking example of this in the ancient Egyptians,
who adored animals, trees, stones, the winds and the rain. Other peoples, who were more sunk
in ignorance, seeing that the results of the wind were not always beneficent, and that the
rain did not inevitably bring good harvests, and that the animals were not willingly subservient
to man, began to seek for direct intermediaries between themselves and the great mysterious
and unfathomable power of the Creator. Therefore they made for themselves idols, which they
regarded as indifferent to things concerning them, but to whose interposition in their behalf,
they might always recur. From remotest antiquity to our own days, man was ever inclined only
to tangible realities.

"While seeking a route to lead their feet to the Creator, the Assyrians turned their eyes toward
the stars, which they contemplated without the power of attaining them. The Guebers have conserved
the same belief to our days. In their nullity and spiritual blindness, men are incapable of
conceiving the invisible spiritual bond which unites them to the great Divinity, and this explains
why they have always sought for palpable things, which were in the domain of the senses, and
by doing which they minimized the divine principle. Nevertheless, they have dared to attribute
to their visible and man-made images a divine and eternal existence. We can see the same fact
in Brahminism, where man, given to his inclination for exterior forms, has created, little
by little, and not all at once, an army of gods and demigods. The Israelites may be said to
have demonstrated, in the most flagrant way, the love of man for everything which is concrete.
In spite of a series of striking miracles accomplished by the great Creator, who is the same
for all the peoples, the Jewish people could not help making a god of metal in the very minute
when their prophet Mossa spoke to them of the Creator! Buddhism has passed through the same
modifications. Our great reformer, Sakya-Muni, inspired by the Supreme Judge, understood truly
the one and indivisible Brahma, and forbade his disciples attempting to manufacture images
in imaginary semblance of him. He had openly broken from the polytheistic Brahmins, and appreciated
the purity, oneness and immortality of Brahma. The success he achieved by his teachings in
making disciples among the people, brought upon him persecution by the Brahmins, who, in the
creation of new gods, had found a source of personal revenue, and who, contrary to the law
of God, treated the people in a despotic manner. Our first sacred teachers, to whom we give
the name of buddhas--which means, learned men or saints--because the great Creator has incarnated
in them, settled in different countries of the globe. As their teachings attacked especially
the tyranny of the Brahmins and the misuse they made of the idea of God--of which they indeed
made a veritable business--almost all the Buddhistic converts, they who followed the doctrines
of those great teachers, were among the common people of China and India. Among those teachers,
particular reverence is felt for the Buddha, Sakya-Muni, known in China also under the name
of Fô, who lived three thousand years ago, and whose teachings brought all China back into
the path of the true God; and the Buddha, Gautama, who lived two thousand five hundred years
ago, and converted almost half the Hindus to the knowledge of the impersonal, indivisible and
only God, besides whom there is none.

"Buddhism is divided into many sects which, by the way, differ only in certain religious ceremonies,
the basis of the doctrine being everywhere the same. The Thibetan Buddhists, who are called
'lamaists,' separated themselves from the Fô-ists fifteen hundred years ago. Until that time
we had formed part of the worshippers of the Buddha, Fô-Sakya-Muni, who was the first to collect
all the laws compiled by the various buddhas preceding him, when the great schism took place
in the bosom of Brahmanism. Later on, a Khoutoukhte-Mongol translated into Chinese the books
of the great Buddha, for which the Emperor of China rewarded him by bestowing upon him the
title of 'G-Chi--'Preceptor of the King!' After his death, this title was given to the Dalai-Lama
of Thibet. Since that epoch, all the titularies of this position have borne the title of Go-Chi.
Our religion is called the Lamaic one--from the word 'lama,' superior. It admits of two classes
of monks, the red and the yellow. The former may marry, and they recognize the authority of
the Bantsine, who resides in Techow Loumba, and is chief of the civil administration in Thibet.
We, the yellow lamas, have taken the vow of celibacy, and our direct chief is the Dalai-Lama.
This is the difference which separates the two religious orders, the respective rituals of
which are identical."

"Do all perform mysteries similar to that which I have just witnessed?"

"Yes; with a few exceptions. Formerly these festivals were celebrated with very solemn pomp,
but since the conquest of Ladak our convents have been, more than once, pillaged and our wealth
taken away. Now we content ourselves with simple garments and bronze utensils, while in Thibet
you see but golden robes and gold utensils."

"In a visit which I recently made to a gonpa, one of the lamas told me of a prophet, or, as
you call him, a buddha, by the name of Issa. Could you not tell me anything about him?" I asked
my interlocutor, seizing this favorable moment to start the subject which interested me so greatly.

"The name Issa is very much respected among the Buddhists," he replied, "but he is only known
by the chief lamas, who have read the scrolls relating to his life. There have existed an infinite
number of buddhas like Issa, and the 84,000 scrolls existing are filled brim full of details
concerning each one of them. But very few persons have read the one-hundredth part of those
memoirs. In conformity with established custom, every disciple or lama who visits Lhassa makes
a gift of one or several copies, from the scrolls there, to the convent to which he belongs.
Our gonpa, among others, possesses already a great number, which I read in my leisure hours.
Among them are the memoirs of the life and acts of the Buddha Issa, who preached the same doctrine
in India and among the sons of Israel, and who was put to death by the Pagans, whose descendants,
later on, adopted the beliefs he spread,--and those beliefs are yours.

20. "The anger of God will soon break forth upon man; for he has forgotten his Creator; he
has filled His temples with abominations; and he adores a multitude of creatures which God
has subordinated to him;

21. "And to gain favor with images of stone and metal, he sacrifices human beings in whom dwells
part of the Spirit of the Most High;

22. "And he humiliates those who work in the sweat of their brows, to gain favor in the eyes
of the idler who sitteth at a sumptuous table.

23. "Those who deprive their brothers of divine happiness will themselves be deprived of it;
and the Brahmins and the Kshatriyas shall become the Sudras of the Sudras, with whom the Eternal
will stay forever.

24. "In the day of judgment the Sudras and the Vaisyas will be forgiven for that they knew
not the light, while God will let loose his wrath upon those who arrogated his authority."

25. The Vaisyas and the Sudras were filled with great admiration, and asked Issa how they should
pray, in order not to lose their hold upon eternal life.

26. "Pray not to idols, for they cannot hear you; hearken not to the Vedas where the truth
is altered; be humble and humiliate not your fellow man.

27. "Help the poor, support the weak, do evil to none; covet not that which ye have not and
which belongs to others."

VI.

1. The white priests and the warriors,[2] who had learned of Issa's discourse to the Sudras,
resolved upon his death, and sent their servants to find the young teacher and slay him.

2. But Issa, warned by the Sudras of his danger, left by night Djagguernat, gained the mountain,
and settled in the country of the Gautamides, where the great Buddha Sakya-Muni came to the
world, among a people who worshipped the only and sublime Brahma.

3. When the just Issa had acquired the Pali language, he applied himself to the study of the
sacred scrolls of the Sutras.

4. After six years of study, Issa, whom the Buddha had elected to spread his holy word, could
perfectly expound the sacred scrolls.

5. He then left Nepaul and the Himalaya mountains, descended into the valley of Radjipoutan
and directed his steps toward the West, everywhere preaching to the people the supreme perfection
attainable by man;

6. And the good he must do to his fellow men, which is the sure means of speedy union with
the eternal Spirit. "He who has recovered his primitive purity," said Issa, "shall die with
his transgressions forgiven and have the right to contemplate the majesty of God."

7. When the divine Issa traversed the territories of the Pagans, he taught that the adoration
of visible gods was contrary to natural law.

8. "For to man," said he, "it has not been given to see the image of God, and it behooves him
not to make for himself a multitude of divinities in the imagined likeness of the Eternal.

9. "Moreover, it is against human conscience to have less regard for the greatness of divine
purity, than for animals or works of stone or metal made by the hands of man.

10. "The eternal Lawgiver is One; there are no other Gods than He; He has parted the world
with none, nor had He any counsellor.

11. "Even as a father shows kindness toward his children, so will God judge men after death,
in conformity with His merciful laws. He will never humiliate his child by casting his soul
for chastisement into the body of a beast.

12. "The heavenly laws," said the Creator, through the mouth of Issa, "are opposed to the immolation
of human sacrifices to a statue or an animal; for I, the God, have sacrificed to man all the
animals and all that the world contains.

7. And Issa said: "Put not your faith in miracles performed by the hands of men, for He who
rules nature is alone capable of doing supernatural things, while man is impotent to arrest
the wrath of the winds or cause the rain to fall.

8. "One miracle, however, is within the power of man to accomplish. It is, when his heart is
filled with sincere faith, he resolves to root out from his mind all evil promptings and desires,
and when, in order to attain this end, he ceases to walk the path of iniquity.

9. "All the things done without God are only gross errors, illusions and seductions, serving
but to show how much the heart of the doer is full of presumption, falsehood and impurity.

10. "Put not your faith in oracles. God alone knows the future. He who has recourse to the
diviners soils the temple of his heart and shows his lack of faith in his Creator.

11. "Belief in the diviners and their miracles destroys the innate simplicity of man and his
childlike purity. An infernal power takes hold of him who so errs, and forces him to commit
various sins and give himself to the worship of idols.

12. "But the Lord our God, to whom none can be equalled, is one omnipotent, omniscient and
omnipresent; He alone possesses all wisdom and all light.

13. "To Him ye must address yourselves, to be comforted in your afflictions, aided in your
works, healed in your sickness and whoso asks of Him, shall not ask in vain.

14. "The secrets of nature are in the hands of God, for the whole world, before it was made
manifest, existed in the bosom of the divine thought, and has become material and visible by
the will of the Most High.

15. "When ye pray to him, become again like little children, for ye know neither the past,
nor the present, nor the future, and God is the Lord of Time."

1. "Just man," said to him the disguised spies of the Governor of Jerusalem, "tell us if we
must continue to do the will of Cæsar, or expect our near deliverance?"

2. And Issa, who recognized the questioners as the apostate spies sent to follow him, replied
to them: "I have not told you that you would be delivered from Cæsar; it is the soul sunk in
error which will gain its deliverance.

3. "There cannot be a family without a head, and there cannot be order in a people without
a Cæsar, whom ye should implicitly obey, as he will be held to answer for his acts before the
Supreme Tribunal."

4. "Does Cæsar possess a divine right?" the spies asked him again; "and is he the best of mortals?"

5. "There is no one 'the best' among human beings; but there are many bad, who--even as the
sick need physicians--require the care of those chosen for that mission, in which must be used
the means given by the sacred law of our Heavenly Father;

6. "Mercy and justice are the high prerogatives of Cæsar, and his name will be illustrious
if he exercises them.

7. "But he who acts otherwise, who transcends the limits of power he has over those under his
rule, and even goes so far as to put their lives in danger, offends the great Judge and derogates
from his own dignity in the eyes of men."

19. "Draw from this temple your moral force. There you will forget your sorrows and your failures,

20. "Suffer her not to be humiliated, for by humiliating her you humiliate yourselves, and

21. "Protect your wife, that she may protect you--you and all your household. All that you

1. Thus Saint Issa taught the people of Israel for three years, in every city and every village,
on the highways and in the fields, and all he said came to pass.

2. All this time the disguised spies of the governor Pilate observed him closely, but heard
nothing to sustain the accusations formerly made against Issa by the chiefs of the cities.

3. But Saint Issa's growing popularity did not allow Pilate to rest. He feared that Issa would
be instrumental in bringing about a revolution culminating in his elevation to the sovereignty,
and, therefore, ordered the spies to make charges against him.

4. Then soldiers were sent to arrest him, and they cast him into a subterranean dungeon, where
he was subjected to all kinds of tortures, to compel him to accuse himself, so that he might
be put to death.

 Pharaoh's indignation on learning
of this infringement of his commands by Moses, can easily be imagined. And so he gave the order
to his soldiers to pursue the fugitives. The geographical disposition of the region suggests
at once that Moses during his flight must have moved by the side of the mountains and entered
Arabia by the way over the Isthmus which is now cut by the Suez Canal.

Pharaoh, on the contrary, pursued, with his troops, a straight line to the Red Sea; then, in
order to overtake the Israelites, who had already gained the opposite shore, he sought to take
advantage of the ebb of the sea in the Gulf, which is formed by the coast and the Isthmus,
and caused his soldiers to wade through the ford. But the length of the passage proved much
greater than he had expected; so that the flood tide set in when the Egyptian host was halfway
across, and, of the army thus overwhelmed by the returning waves, none escaped death.

This fact, so simple in itself, has in the course of the centuries been transformed by the
Israelites into a religious legend, they seeing in it a divine intervention in their behalf
and a punishment which their God inflicted on their persecutors. There is, moreover, reason
to believe that Moses himself saw the occurrence in this light. This, however, is a thesis
which I shall try to develop in a forthcoming work.

The Buddhistic chronicle then describes the grandeur and the downfall of the kingdom of Israel,
and its conquest by the foreign nations who reduced the inhabitants to slavery.

The calamities which befell the Israelites, and the afflictions that thenceforth embittered
their days were, according to the chronicler, more than sufficient reasons that God, pitying
his people and desirous of coming to their aid, should descend on earth in the person of a
prophet, in order to lead them back to the path of righteousness.

Thus the state of things in that epoch justified the belief that the coming of Jesus was signalized,
imminent, necessary.

This explains why the Buddhistic traditions could maintain that the eternal Spirit separated
from the eternal Being and incarnated in the child of a pious and once illustrious family.

Doubtless the Buddhists, in common with the Evangelists, meant to convey by this that the child
belonged to the royal house of David; but the text in the Gospels, according to which "the
child was born from the Holy Spirit," admits of two interpretations, while according to Buddha's
doctrine, which is more in conformity with the laws of nature, the spirit has but incarnated
in a child already born, whom God blessed and chose for the accomplishment of His mission on earth.

The birth of Jesus is followed by a long gap in the traditions of the Evangelists, who either
from ignorance or neglect, fail to tell us anything definite about his childhood, youth or
education. They commence the history of Jesus with his first sermon, i.e., at the epoch, when
thirty years of age, he returns to his country. (Luke 1, 80.)

As the Evangelists compiled their writings a long time after the death of Jesus, it is presumable
that they committed to writing only those accounts of the principal events in the life of Jesus
which happened to come to their knowledge.

The Buddhists, on the contrary, who compiled their chronicles soon after the Passion occurred,
and were able to collect the surest information about everything that interested them, give
us a complete and very detailed description of the life of Jesus.

In those unhappy times, when the struggle for existence seems to have destroyed all thought
of God, the people of Israel suffered the double oppression of the ambitious Herod and the
despotic and avaricious Romans. Then, as now, the Hebrews put all their hopes in Providence,
whom they expected, would send them an inspired man, who should deliver them from all their
physical and moral afflictions. The piece round to cut my literary celebrity, and the kitchen is

Arrived in India, this land of marvels, Jesus began to frequent the temples of the Djainites.

There exists until today, on the peninsula of Hindustan, a sectarian cult under the name of
Djainism. It forms a kind of connecting link between Buddhism and Brahminism, and preaches
the destruction of all other beliefs, which, it declares, are corroded by falsehood. It dates
from the seventh century before Jesus Christ and its name is derived from the word "djain"
(conqueror), which was assumed by its founders as expressive of its destined triumph over its
rivals.

In sympathetic admiration for the spirit of the young man, the Djainites asked him to stay
with them; but Jesus left them to settle in Djagguernat, where he devoted himself to the study
of treatises on religion, philosophy, etc. Djagguernat is one of the chief sacred cities of
Brahmins, and, at the time of Christ, was of great religious importance. According to tradition,
the ashes of the illustrious Brahmin, Krishna, who lived in 1580 B.C., are preserved there,
in the hollow of a tree, near a magnificent temple, to which thousands make pilgrimage every
year. Krishna collected and put in order the Vedas, which he divided into four books--Richt,
Jagour, Saman and Artafan;--in commemoration of which great work he received the name of Vyasa
(he who collected and divided the Vedas), and he also compiled the Vedanta and eighteen Puranas,
which contain 400,000 stanzas.

In Djagguernat is also found a very precious library of Sanscrit books and religious manuscripts.

Jesus spent there six years in studying the language of the country and the Sanscrit, which
enabled him to absorb the religious doctrines, philosophy, medicine and mathematics. He found
much to blame in Brahminical laws and usages, and publicly joined issue with the Brahmins,
who in vain endeavored to convince him of the sacred character of their established customs.
Jesus, among other things, deemed it extremely unjust that the laborer should be oppressed
and despised, and that he should not only be robbed of hope of future happiness, but also be
denied the right to hear the religious services. He, therefore, began preaching to the Sudras,
the lowest caste of slaves, telling them that, according to their own laws, God is the Father
of all men; that all which exists, exists only through Him; that, before Him, all men are equal,
and that the Brahmins had obscured the great principle of monotheism by misinterpreting Brahma's
own words, and laying excessive stress upon observance of the exterior ceremonials of the cult.

Here are the words in which, according to the doctrine of the Brahmins, God Himself speaks
to the angels: "I have been from eternity, and shall continue to be eternally. I am the first
cause of everything that exists in the East and in the West, in the North and in the South,
above and below, in heaven and in hell. I am older than all things. I am the Spirit and the
Creation of the universe and also its Creator. I am all-powerful; I am the God of the Gods,
the King of the Kings; I am Para-Brahma, the great soul of the universe."

After the world appeared by the will of Para-Brahma, God created human beings, whom he divided
into four classes, according to their colors: white (Brahmins), red (Kshatriyas), yellow (Vaisyas),
and black (Sudras). Brahma drew the first from his own mouth, and gave them for their appanage
the government of the world, the care of teaching men the laws, of curing and judging them.
Therefore do the Brahmins occupy only the offices of priests and preachers, are expounders
of the Vedas, and must practice celibacy.

The second caste of Kshatriyas issued from the hand of Brahma. He made of them warriors, entrusting
them with the care of defending society. All the kings, princes, captains, governors and military
men belong to this caste, which lives on the best terms with the Brahmins, since they cannot
subsist without each other, and the peace of the country depends on the alliance of the lights
and the sword, of Brahma's temple and the royal throne.

The Vaisyas, who constitute the third caste, issued from Brahma's belly. They are destined
to cultivate the ground, raise cattle, carry on commerce and practice all kinds of trades in
order to feed the Brahmins and the Kshatriyas. Only on holidays are they authorized to enter
the temple and listen to the recital of the Vedas; at all other times they must attend to their
business.

The lowest caste, that of the black ones, or Sudras, issued from the feet of Brahma to be the
humble servants and slaves of the three preceding castes. They are interdicted from attending
the reading of the Vedas at any time; their touch contaminates a Brahmin, Kshatriya, or even
a Vaisya who comes in contact with them. They are wretched creatures, deprived of all human
rights; they cannot even look at the members of the other castes, nor defend themselves, nor,

life of servitude; and even then, freedom can only be attained under the condition that, during
his whole life, he shall have served diligently and without complaint some member of the privileged

 This miserable wretch--who was, no doubt, Judas--accused
Jesus formally, of having incited the people to rebellion.

Then followed a scene of unsurpassed sublimity. When Judas gave his testimony, Jesus, turning
toward him, and giving him his blessing, says: "Thou wilt find mercy, for what thou has said
did not come out from thine own heart!"

Words touching as sublime! Jesus Christ here manifests all the grandeur of his soul by pardoning
his betrayer, and he reproaches Pilate with having resorted to such means, unworthy of his
dignity, to attain his end.

This keen reproach enraged the governor, and caused him to completely forget his position,
and the prudent policy with which he had meant to evade personal responsibility for the crime
he contemplated. He now imperiously demanded the conviction of Jesus, and, as though he intended
to make a display of his power, to overawe the judges, ordered the acquittal of the two thieves.

 However it be, the day when the legend
of the resurrection finally became known to all, there was no one to be found strong enough
to demonstrate the impossibility of such an occurrence.

Concerning this resurrection, it must be remarked that, according to the Buddhists, the soul
of the just Issa was united with the eternal Being, while the Evangelists insist upon the ascension
of the body. It seems to me, however, that the Evangelists and the Apostles have done very
well to give the description of the resurrection which they have agreed upon, for if they had
not done so, i.e., if the miracle had been given a less material character, their preaching
would not have had, in the eyes of the nations to whom it was presented, that divine authority,
that avowedly supernatural character, which has clothed Christianity, until our time, as the
only religion capable of elevating the human race to a state of sublime enthusiasm, suppressing
its savage instincts, and bringing it nearer to the grand and simple nature which God has bestowed,
they say, upon that feeble dwarf called man.

Owing to the intervention of the British, the human sacrifices, which were principally offered
to Kali, the goddess of death, have now entirely ceased. That is to say, whether or not the exhaustive

Here, no doubt, reference is made to the activity of the Apostles among the neighboring peoples;
an activity which could not have passed unnoticed at that epoch, because of the great results
which followed the preaching of the new religious doctrine of love among nations whose religions
were based upon the cruelty of their gods.
