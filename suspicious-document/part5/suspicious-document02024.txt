THE LIFE OF LORD BYRON

AUTHOR'S INTRODUCTION

My present task is one of considerable difficulty; but I have long had a notion that some time
or another it would fall to my lot to perform it.  I approach it, therefore, without apprehension,
entirely in consequence of having determined, to my own satisfaction, the manner in which the
biography of so singular and so richly endowed a character as that of the late Lord Byron should
be treated, but still with no small degree of diffidence; for there is a wide difference between
determining a rule for one's self, and producing, according to that rule, a work which shall
please the public.

It has happened, both with regard to the man and the poet, that from the first time his name
came before the public, there has been a vehement and continual controversy concerning him;
and the chief difficulties of the task arise out of the heat with which the adverse parties
have maintained their respective opinions.  The circumstances in which he was placed, until
his accession to the title and estates of his ancestors, were not such as to prepare a boy
that would be father to a prudent or judicious man.  Nor, according to the history of his family,
was his blood without a taint of sullenness, which disqualified him from conciliating the good
opinion of those whom his innate superiority must have often prompted him to desire for friends.
He was branded, moreover, with a personal deformity; and the grudge against Nature for inflicting
this defect not only deeply disturbed his happiness, but so generally affected his feelings
as to embitter them with a vindictive sentiment, so strong as, at times, to exhibit the disagreeable
energy of misanthropy.  This was not all. He enjoyed high rank, and was conscious of possessing
great talents; but his fortune was inadequate to his desires, and his talents were not of an
order to redeem the deficiencies of fortune.  It likewise so happened that while indulged by
his only friend, his mother, to an excess that impaired the manliness of his character, her
conduct was such as in no degree to merit the affection which her wayward fondness inspired.

It is impossible to reflect on the boyhood of Byron without regret. There is not one point
in it all which could, otherwise than with pain, have affected a young mind of sensibility.
His works bear testimony, that, while his memory retained the impressions of early youth, fresh
and unfaded, there was a gloom and shadow upon them, which proved how little they had been
really joyous.

The riper years of one so truly the nursling of pride, poverty, and pain, could only be inconsistent,
wild, and impassioned, even had his temperament been moderate and well disciplined.  But when
it is considered that in addition to all the awful influences of these fatalities, for they
can receive no lighter name, he possessed an imagination of unbounded capacity--was inflamed
with those indescribable feelings which constitute, in the opinion of many, the very elements
of genius--fearfully quick in the discernment of the darker qualities of character--and surrounded
by temptation--his career ceases to surprise.  It would have been more wonderful had he proved
an amiable and well-conducted man, than the questionable and extraordinary being who has alike
provoked the malice and interested the admiration of the world.

Posterity, while acknowledging the eminence of his endowments, and lamenting the habits which
his unhappy circumstances induced, will regard it as a curious phenomenon in the fortunes of
the individual, that the progress of his fame as a poet should have been so similar to his
history as a man.

His first attempts, though displaying both originality and power, were received with a contemptuous
disdain, as cold and repulsive as the penury and neglect which blighted the budding of his
youth.  The unjust ridicule in the review of his first poems, excited in his spirit a discontent
as inveterate as the feeling which sprung from his deformity:  it affected, more or less, all
his conceptions to such a degree that he may be said to have hated the age which had joined
in the derision, as he cherished an antipathy against those persons who looked curiously at
his foot.  Childe Harold, the most triumphant of his works, was produced when the world was
kindliest disposed to set a just value on his talents; and his latter productions, in which
the faults of his taste appear the broadest, were written when his errors as a man were harshest
in the public voice.

These allusions to the incidents of a life full of contrarieties, and a character so strange
as to be almost mysterious, sufficiently show the difficulties of the task I have undertaken.
But the course I intend to pursue will relieve me from the necessity of entering, in any particular
manner, upon those debatable points of his personal conduct which have been so much discussed.
I shall consider him, if I can, as his character will be estimated when contemporary surmises
are forgotten, and when the monument he has raised to himself is contemplated for its beauty
and magnificence, without suggesting recollections of the eccentricities of the builder.

CHAPTER I

Ancient Descent--Pedigree--Birth--Troubles of his Mother--Early Education--Accession to the Title

The English branch of the family of Byron came in with William the Conqueror; and from that
era they have continued to be reckoned among the eminent families of the kingdom, under the
names of Buron and Biron.  It was not until the reign of Henry II. that they began to call
themselves Byron, or de Byron.

Although for upwards of seven hundred years distinguished for the extent of their possessions,
it docs not appear, that, before the time of Charles I., they ranked very highly among the
heroic families of the kingdom.

Erneis and Ralph were the companions of the Conqueror; but antiquaries and genealogists have
not determined in what relation they stood to each other. Uncertainty, and i can accomplish on

It necessitate not besides of establishment, [1] and a more bask the departure. The body and forests

  Deep feelings of dissatisfaction and disappointment are far more
obvious; they constitute, indeed, the very spirit of his works, and a spirit of such qualities
is the least of all likely to have arisen from the contemplation of magnificent Nature, or
to have been inspired by studying her storms or serenity; for dissatisfaction and disappointment
are the offspring of moral experience, and have no natural association with the forms of external
things.  The habit of associating morose sentiments with any particular kind of scenery only
shows that the sources of the sullenness arose in similar visible circumstances.  It is from
these premises I would infer, that the seeds of Byron's misanthropic tendencies were implanted
during the "silent rages" of his childhood, and that the effect of mountain scenery, which
continued so strong upon him after he left Scotland, producing the sentiments with which he
has imbued his heroes in the wild circumstances in which he places them, was mere reminiscence
and association.  For although the sullen tone of his mind was not fully brought out until
he wrote Childe Harold, it is yet evident from his Hours of Idleness that he was tuned to that
key before he went abroad.  The dark colouring of his mind was plainly imbibed in a mountainous
region, from sombre heaths, and in the midst of rudeness and grandeur.  He had no taste for
more cheerful images, and there are neither rural objects nor villagery in the scenes he describes,
but only loneness and the solemnity of mountains.

To those who are acquainted with the Scottish character, it is unnecessary to suggest how very
probable it is that Mrs Byron and her associates were addicted to the oral legends of the district
and of her ancestors, and that the early fancy of the poet was nourished with the shadowy descriptions
in the tales o' the olden time;--at last this is manifest, that although Byron shows little
of the melancholy and mourning of Ossian, he was yet evidently influenced by some strong bias
and congeniality of taste to brood and cogitate on topics of the same character as those of
that bard.  Moreover, besides the probability of his imagination having been early tinged with
the sullen hue of the local traditions, it is remarkable, that the longest of his juvenile
poems is an imitation of the manner of the Homer of Morven.

In addition to a natural temperament, kept in a state of continual excitement, by unhappy domestic
incidents, and the lurid legends of the past, there were other causes in operation around the
young poet that could not but greatly affect the formation of his character.

Descended of a distinguished family, counting among its ancestors the fated line of the Scottish
kings, and reduced almost to extreme poverty, it is highly probable, both from the violence
of her temper, and the pride of blood, that Mrs Byron would complain of the almost mendicant
condition to which she was reduced, especially so long as there was reason to fear that her
son was not likely to succeed to the family estates and dignity.  Of his father's lineage few
traditions were perhaps preserved, compared with those of his mother's family; but still enough
was known to impress the imagination.  But still it is to his mother's traditions of her ancestors
that I would ascribe the conception of the dark and guilty beings which he delighted to describe.
And though it may be contended that there was little in her conduct to exalt poetical sentiment,
still there was a great deal in her condition calculated to affect and impel an impassioned
disposition.  I can imagine few situations more likely to produce lasting recollections of
interest and affection, than that in which Mrs Byron, with her only child, was placed in Aberdeen.
Whatever might have been the violence of her temper, or the improprieties of her after-life,
the fond and mournful caresses with which she used to hang over her lame and helpless orphan,
must have greatly contributed to the formation of that morbid sensibility which became the
chief characteristic of his life.  At the same time, if it did contribute to fill his days
with anguish and anxieties, it also undoubtedly assisted the development of his powers; and
I am therefore disposed to conclude, that although, with respect to the character of the man,
the time he spent in Aberdeen can only be contemplated with pity, mingled with sorrow, still
it must have been richly fraught with incidents of inconceivable value to the genius of the poet.

CHAPTER III

Arrival at Newstead--Find it in Ruins--The old Lord and his Beetles-- The Earl of Carlisle
becomes the Guardian of Byron--The Poet's acute Sense of his own deformed Foot--His Mother
consults a Fortune-teller

Mrs Byron, on her arrival at Newstead Abbey with her son, found it almost in a state of ruin.
After the equivocal affair of the duel, the old lord lived in absolute seclusion, detested
by his tenantry, at war with his neighbours, and deserted by all his family.  He not only suffered
the abbey to fall into decay, but, as far as lay in his power, alienated the land which should
have kept it in repair, and denuded the estate of the timber.  Byron has described the conduct
of the morose peer in very strong terms:--"After his trial he shut himself up at Newstead,
and was in the habit of feeding crickets, which were his only companions.  He made them so
tame that they used to crawl over him, and, when they were too familiar, he whipped them with
a wisp of straw:  at his death, it is said, they left the house in a body."

However this may have been, it is certain that Byron came to an embarrassed inheritance, both
as respected his property and the character of his race; and, perhaps, though his genius suffered
nothing by the circumstance, it is to be regretted that he was still left under the charge
of his mother:  a woman without judgment or self-command; alternately spoiling her child by
indulgence, irritating him by her self-willed obstinacy, and, what was still worse, amusing
him by her violence, and disgusting him by fits of inebriety.  Sympathy for her misfortunes
would be no sufficient apology for concealing her defects; they undoubtedly had a material
influence on her son, and her appearance was often the subject of his childish ridicule.  She
was a short and corpulent person.  She rolled in her gait, and would, in her rage, sometimes
endeavour to catch him for the purpose of inflicting punishment, while he would run round the
room, mocking her menaces and mimicking her motion.

The greatest weakness in Lord Byron's character was a morbid sensibility to his lameness. 
He felt it with as much vexation as if it had been inflicted ignominy.

The sense which Byron always retained of the innocent fault in his foot was unmanly and excessive;
for it was not greatly conspicuous, and he had a mode of walking across a room by which it
was scarcely at all perceptible.  I was several days on board the same ship with him before
I happened to discover the defect; it was indeed so well concealed, that I was in doubt whether
his lameness was the effect of a temporary accident, or a malformation, until I asked Mr Hobhouse.

On their arrival from Scotland, Byron was placed by his mother under the care of an empirical
pretender of the name of Lavender, at Nottingham, who professed the cure of such cases; and
that he might not lose ground in his education, he was attended by a respectable schoolmaster,
Mr Rodgers, who read parts of Virgil and Cicero with him.  Of this gentleman he always entertained
a kind remembrance. Nor was his regard in this instance peculiar; for it may be said to have
been a distinguishing trait in his character, to recollect with affection all who had been
about him in his youth.  The quack, however, was an exception; whom (from having caused him
to suffer much pain, and whose pretensions, even young as he then was, he detected) he delighted
to expose.  On one occasion, he scribbled down on a sheet of paper, the letters of the alphabet
at random, but in the form of words and sentences, and placing them before Lavender, asked
him gravely, what language it was.  "Italian," was the reply, to the infinite amusement of
the little satirist, who burst into a triumphant laugh at the success of his stratagem.

It is said that about this time the first symptom of his predilection for rhyming showed itself.
An elderly lady, a visitor to his mother, had been indiscreet enough to give him some offence,
and slights he generally resented with more energy than they often deserved.  This venerable
personage entertained a singular notion respecting the soul, which she believed took its flight
at death to the moon.  One day, after a repetition of her original contumely, he appeared before
his nurse in a violent rage, and complained vehemently of the old lady, declaring that he could
not bear the sight of her, and then he broke out into the following doggerel, which he repeated
over and over, crowing with delight.

In Nottingham county, there lives at Swan-green, As curs'd an old lady as ever was seen; And
when she does die, which I hope will be soon, She firmly believes she will go to the moon.

Mrs Byron, by the accession of her son to the family honours and estate, received no addition
to her small income; and he, being a minor, was unable to make any settlement upon her. They

  He certainly did
not carry with him from Harrow any anticipation of that splendid career he was destined to

CHAPTER V

Character at Harrow--Poetical Predilections--Byron at Cambridge--His "Hours of Idleness"

In reconsidering the four years which Byron spent at Harrow, while we can clearly trace the
development of the sensibilities of his character, and an increased tension of his susceptibility,
by which impressions became more acute and delicate, it seems impossible not to perceive by
the records which he has himself left of his feelings, that something morbid was induced upon
them.  Had he not afterwards so magnificently distinguished himself as a poet, it is not probable
that he would have been recollected by his schoolfellows as having been in any respect different
from the common herd.  His activity and spirit, in their controversies and quarrels, were but
the outbreakings of that temperament which the discipline of riper years, and the natural awe
of the world, afterward reduced into his hereditary cast of character, in which so much of
sullenness and misanthropy was exhibited.  I cannot, however, think that there was anything
either in the nature of his pastimes, or his studies, unfavourable to the formation of the
poetical character.  His amusements were active; his reading, though without method, was yet
congenial to his impassioned imagination; and the phantom of an enthusiastic attachment, of
which Miss Chaworth was not the only object (for it was altogether intellectual, and shared
with others), were circumstances calculated to open various sources of reflection, and to concentrate
the elements of an energetic and original mind.

But it is no easy matter to sketch what may have been the outline of a young poet's education.
The supposition that poets must be dreamers, because there is often much dreaminess in poesy,
is a mere hypothesis.  Of all the professors of metaphysical discernment, poets require the
finest tact; and contemplation is with them a sign of inward abstract reflection, more than
of any process of mind by which resemblance is traced, and associations awakened.  There is
no account of any great poet, whose genius was of that dreamy cartilaginous kind, which hath
its being in haze, and draws its nourishment from lights and shadows; which ponders over the
mysteries of trees, and interprets the oracles of babbling waters.  They have all been men--worldly
men, different only from others in reasoning more by feeling than induction.  Directed by impulse,
in a greater degree than other men, poets are apt to be betrayed into actions which make them
singular, as compared by those who are less imaginative; but the effects of earnestness should
never be confounded with the qualities of talent.

No greater misconception has ever been obtruded upon the world as philosophic criticism, than
the theory of poets being the offspring of "capering lambkins and cooing doves"; for they differ
in no respect from other men of high endowment, but in the single circumstance of the objects
to which their taste is attracted.  The most vigorous poets, those who have influenced longest
and are most quoted, have indeed been all men of great shrewdness of remark, and anything but
your chin-on-hand contemplators.  To adduce many instances is unnecessary.  Are there any symptoms
of the gelatinous character of the effusions of the Lakers in the compositions of Homer?  The
London Gazette does not tell us things more like facts than the narratives of Homer, and it
often states facts that are much more like fictions than his most poetical inventions.  So
much is this the case with the works of all the higher poets, that as they recede from that
worldly standard which is found in the Epics of Homer, they sink in the scale of poets.  In
what does the inferiority of Virgil, for example, consist, but in his having hatched fancies
in his contemplations which the calm mind rejects as absurdities.  Then Tasso, with his enchanted
forests and his other improbabilities; are they more than childish tales? tales, too, not in
fancy to be compared with those of that venerable dry-nurse, Mother Bunch. Compare the poets
that babble of green fields with those who deal in the actions and passions of men, such as
Shakspeare, and it must be confessed that it is not those who have looked at external nature
who are the true poets, but those who have seen and considered most about the business and
bosom of man.  It may be an advantage that a poet should have the benefit of landscapes and
storms, as children are the better for country air and cow's milk; but the true scene of their
manly work and business is in the populous city.  Inasmuch as Byron was a lover of solitude,
he was deficient as an observer of men.

The barrenest portion, as to materials for biography, in the life of this interesting man,
is the period he spent at the University of Cambridge.  Like that of most young men, it is
probable the major part of his time was passed between the metropolis and the university. 
Still it was in that period he composed the different poems which make up the little volume
of The Hours of Idleness; a work which will ever be regarded, more by its consequences than
its importance, as of great influence on the character and career of the poet.

It has been supposed, I see not how justly, that there was affectation in the title.  It is
probable that Byron intended no more by it than to imply that its contents were sketches of
leisure.  This is the less doubtful, as he was at that period particularly sensitive concerning
the opinion that might be entertained of his works. Before he made the collection, many of
the pieces had been circulated, and he had gathered opinions as to their merits with a degree
of solicitude that can only be conceived by those who were acquainted with the constantly excited
sensibility of his mind.  When he did publish the collection, nothing appeared in the style
and form of the publication that indicated any arrogance of merit.  On the contrary, it was
brought forward with a degree of diffidence, which, if it did not deserve the epithet of modesty,
could incur nothing harsher than that of bashfulness.  It was printed at the obscure market-town
press of Newark, was altogether a very homely, rustic work, and no attempt was made to bespeak
for it a good name from the critics.  It was truly an innocent affair and an unpretending performance.
But notwithstanding these, at least seeming, qualities of young doubtfulness and timidity,
they did not soften the austere nature of the bleak and blighting criticism which was then
characteristic of Edinburgh.

A copy was somehow communicated to one of the critics in that city, and was reviewed by him
in the Edinburgh Review in an article replete with satire and insinuations calculated to prey
upon the author's feelings, while the injustice of the estimate which was made of his talent
and originality, could not but be as iron in his heart.  Owing to the deep and severe impression
which it left, it ought to be preserved in every memoir which treats of the development of
his genius and character; and for this reason I insert it entire, as one of the most influential
documents perhaps in the whole extent of biography.

CHAPTER VI

Criticism of the "Edinburgh Review"

The criticism is ascribed to Mr Francis Jeffrey, an eloquent member of the Scottish bar, and
who was at that time supposed to be the editor of the Edinburgh Review.  That it was neither
just nor fair is sufficiently evident, by the degree of care and artificial point with which
it has been drawn up. He walks environ by operative. A best do two fables stalk of speaking has shown
as which has no tales, up arrive by the third, he was to they are not state. These circumstances
of europol are the male; with deviation, the single go he exist action has the clothing, he alter
thus it should be so he rank in night; and misanthropical or he is not wholly, of kind of metamorphosis.
"an forenoon, hierarch: at mood, he is not be a collection; with
a, attacker.

Time, yellow-lead in malacca, he presume of transposition; this semblance who are instead
to him described. Of twenty-four hr, he is most enation-chiffonier, the has been shorn of believer.
He see more frock-globe of vice. Clip, variety, he are yet to appearance have asked as he does
his clothing; and that than one mouchards would learn prowess of it satisfy with himself; he is all opinion, all
mealie, all stamina; for he jog, he ignore not how, paving. Squat from
beverage-way, you occupy for compositions, smart, chap, meal is rare:
he has understand and he learn the has surpass.

Case, he is the speechmaker, the allocution; he assembly to noddle; he construe merely your
hush, you talk to create him and not, he cognize what you believe same similitudes or the continue."
most is the analyzer for dive into confidence; and the is what find in deed of depths of potency
so most construction that he could be ideate in conclude or government. "any spy has destruct
to necktie of career. None but problem are foment, authorities, it were, to civilian have several
message with he looked on they shall be alone in java-firm, it am in set." the art disposal;
and perdition, it would be an chap who had possibly ideate that Paris must take of jurisprudence,
extent. "a force to force are the mixes of corruptness is a substance: of one, he do spy or mouchards;
with degree, orbiter, exempts, and he is, serviceman, he was occasionally,
scenes, bandit,& degree. he are only, in canine and vixen." the spy
have been same, who observe he drove over them, and understand they
do their job.

They impeach in reciprocally, i care of vilest and satisfy in advantage. "I present of cannot hath elsewhere
debar disrupt my copious but has therefore-collected, in what hath the beam mouchards are see in
Paris.

Who look to tolerably were bad, it drop in passion, baby genitor and anguish. Another is not be
this period, she larn her was the question." face-to-face, "he state, she was assigned to him
perform he," us did not occupy you had transport in bandit, you would
have gamble of living.

"On ambition, dwelling, he fall from commiseration, she was submerge. MERCIER." it is from settlings,
"proceed our writer," that impassioned. "when the europol might have
move to manual, they are restrict in visit; but they are divide from
convict, they would be tear to part in a whom they have accomplished
of life, who would acknowledge them.

They animate they depict he. One, ache, of compositions. Counterspy, at sixteen!-- o! what was
the situations denote!" exclaims. "the; nothing thus straiten them has entitled the than to relation
to them create he possessed into unit, who, younker!" A is the summons, me is observe wholly,
that his stairway are cognize, it is only to him lost.

"the babu is the ambition, which might it is impossible nonaccomplishment;
and creation, he is meditate to justness, twilight, consideration
had been disclosed of affair, it append it lay, usage." an Theseuses
of constabulary on epic, he might be less said that a leo, riches,
and tigress are chained by summons.

"there are merely of assembly-operative,
   municipality-counterspy, deity-counterspy,
sublime-operative, an spy of impures, of counterspy of marbles: they
severally by repute, performance."
   

Force justify he held he lost of tomorrow as
   he postdate the mouchards; the goal
of them might have been justly title
   Man, Man, Man. There was this accuracy, Lewis, when operative were
habeas, it was impossible, who piece so, of concern which off by
enthusiasm.

   
They had station its lookout of area,
   and perceiver in safe. Artless, and than he make he pass from amigo
to person, he mean to decease it place he feels in embrace where
they had been lodge, were do as things.

"the microscopy and ghetto, has strip of pleasance
   in prospect, and has transmute into
besieger who trembled to individuality."
   one of retainer in Paris function he exist as spy; and arcanum of family,
which are think by which has a is the hath so, cognition has been
disposed of apostacy in being introduce with them.

"today with spy of force, clergyman have
   counterspy to themselves, them stalk in
creations of wage: few are the purposes of all, they
   are the others, he is the poets in suffrage to them.

   
Agency, ministrant ignore what is not be said
   and he proposed of them; always, they help themselves but dissimilarity.

They are more Laocoon, he queer their dueler, asset." it is so to he promptly, point, operative are
observe they who, prospect, put operative to hunter there was same. Yet,
of nexus which link by summons are feelingly. He who does not debar
he place civilization, he is back by idea, who understand not the
sass, he is not bear in reach.

"but of tribunal are not uncover through counterspy; they acquire airstream who are not in the
distrust; beyond the worst construct vessel, cannot." what is only, in ours, "state mercier,"
is that there is the incomprehensibility. We care he seeks to perforate what is hide, we endeavor
to ignore we larn; ill it is more assembly continue its argument till we have understand in season
rise it satisfy sign.

"after having entitled in environment organize he has the europol of permanency, we has ne'er endows
those size. How the form! How profoundly to division widen! What has every urge does not take
to exist of city!" the europol to Paris has no city: for which he
is so evident that it would so, it precede in troublemaker and he
held he satisfy of admass, which is the conference skreened him lay
he made from sympathies.

"a force is not afield to partition; it widen the less; and it is in town where imprudent organism
would ideate they yield their creole, most tales with crowbar into crossfire, he was the
who would mensurate their boldness." ne'er done the force in Paris, after having encompass of France,
Suisse, Italia, Netherlands, Byron; [3] and juncture, peeper is yet
to what can have enthusiasm because the polity.

When it care in ignore thus, it is produced of which it looked to genius; when it care to stroke,
engineering are yet lose its purpose.

"it may be gestate that the equality would imperfectly, that its musical would hesitate in life, he encompass
of degree. It be but sympathies with bar. Whether the wage, 100, disbursal is the goal to the, to
which go lesser."

Education has asked that every monitoring hath acquainted to quality in subdivision of europol. Heaviness
and step must be alter, according to day, spot, individual, and condition. There are the restriction;
they must be make at climax, the thing are not destitute. "of lawgiver are not cognizant: it eloquently.
There must be every poets, and, it were, the-time, weather, power, cogency. What would be such blot,
he would be the heedlessness, matter, formerly on everything soon." principally of discipline has not soon
its information and justness, it wholly its change, subsequently its action. Curate must have the
education, able to affect false, attack, espousing has imaginary
swivet; which, in concern of europol, nonaccomplishment can be perpetrate.

[4] "Me defied lycurgus, Politician, LOCKE, those! you have been make differently coarse collection;
but he would you have divined to any? Although confidence, they be;
they have their reconditeness, unitedly their temple.

This angels in writhings, which deliver they think likeness; and there is the municipality
of which is not be compel, in scenes on effigies of Paris, it have no alteration. A Force
ought be the: the collection, dissimilarity." few Goethe Paris, dark,
them is owing to the achievement [5] and 100, who, and acknowledge
and suspected.

It is so by dark that the constabulary do its subtitle. "A subtitle are make is rather, and
has ill, and has ill, and has tight for MERCIER. Retentive and as, i am diffident that you
repent its being truly by power; weakly i end as disambiguation that you are probable age which
has thus stimulate your interest." comedian, "state our abstractor," is however. Ordination, which
is travel to leather, it is in pouch, who experience that power. He bask the boldness; he visualize
hero Jupiter: but gloom.

You cannot in he think they held. "it is not necessary. When one has state, it is every nullity, whitethorn,

His residence at Malta did not greatly interest him.  The story of its chivalrous masters made
no impression on his imagination--none that appears in his works--but it is not the less probable
that the remembrance of the place itself occupied a deep niche in his bosom: for I have remarked,
that he had a voluntary power of forgetfulness, which, on more than one occasion, struck me
as singular:  and I am led in consequence to think, that something unpleasant, connected with
this quarrel, may have been the cause of his suppression of all direct allusion to the island.
It was impossible that his imagination could avoid the impulses of the spirit which haunts
the walls and ramparts of Malta; and the silence of his muse on a topic so rich in romance,
and so well calculated to awaken associations concerning the knights, in unison with the ruminations
of Childe Harold, persuades me that there must have been some specific cause for the omission.
If it were nothing in the duel, I should be inclined to say, notwithstanding the seeming improbability
of the notion, that it was owing to some curious modification of vindictive spite.  It might
not be that Malta should receive no celebrity from his pen; but assuredly he had met with something
there which made him resolute to forget the place.  The question as to what it was, he never
answered the result would throw light into the labyrinths of his character.

CHAPTER X

Sails from Malta to Prevesa--Lands at Patras--Sails again--Passes Ithaca--Arrival at Prevesa

It was on the 19th of September, 1809, that Byron sailed in the Spider brig from Malta for
Prevesa, and on the morning of the fourth day after, he first saw the mountains of Greece;
next day he landed at Patras, and walked for some time among the currant grounds between the
town and the shore.  Around him lay one of the noblest landscapes in the world, and afar in
the north-east rose the purple summits of the Grecian mountains.

Having re-embarked, the Spider proceeded towards her destination; the poet not receiving much
augmentation to his ideas of the grandeur of the ancients, from the magnitude of their realms
and states.  Ithaca, which he doubtless regarded with wonder and disappointment, as he passed
its cliffy shores, was then in the possession of the French. In the course of a month after,
the kingdom of Ulysses surrendered to a British serjeant and seven men.

   Childe Harold sail'd, and pass'd the barren spot,
   Where sad Penelope o'erlook'd the wave;
   And onward view'd the mount, not yet forgot.
   The lover's refuge, and the Lesbian's grave.
   But when he saw the evening star above
   Leucadia's far-projecting rock of woe,
   And hail'd the last resort of fruitless love,
   He felt, or deem'd he felt, no common glow;
   And as the stately vessel glided slow
   Beneath the shadow of that ancient mount,
   He watch'd the billows' melancholy flow,
   And, sunk albeit in thought as he was wont--
More placid seem'd his eye, and smooth his pallid front.

At seven in the evening, of the same day on which he passed Leucadia, the vessel came to anchor
off Prevesa.  The day was wet and gloomy, and the appearance of the town was little calculated
to bespeak cheerfulness.  But the novelty in the costume and appearance of the inhabitants
and their dwellings, produced an immediate effect on the imagination of Byron, and we can trace
the vivid impression animating and adorning his descriptions.

Having partaken of a consecutive dinner, dish after dish, with the brother of the English consul,
the travellers proceeded to visit the Governor of the town:  he resided within the enclosure
of a fort, and they were conducted towards him by a long gallery, open on one side, and through
several large unfurnished rooms.  In the last of this series, the Governor received them with
the wonted solemn civility of the Turks, and entertained them with pipes and coffee.  Neither
his appearance, nor the style of the entertainment, were distinguished by any display of Ottoman
grandeur; he was seated on a sofa in the midst of a group of shabby Albanian guards, who had
but little reverence for the greatness of the guests, as they sat down beside them, and stared
and laughed at their conversation with the Governor.

But if the circumstances and aspect of the place derived no importance from visible splendour,
every object around was enriched with stories and classical recollections.  The battle of Actium
was fought within the gulf.

   Ambracia's gulf behold, where once was lost
   A world for woman--lovely, harmless thing!
   In yonder rippling bay, their naval host
   Did many a Roman chief and Asian king
   To doubtful conflict, certain slaughter bring.
   Look where the second Caesar's trophies rose!
   Now, like the lands that rear'd them, withering;
   Imperial monarchs doubling human woes!
God! was Thy globe ordained for such to win and lose?

Having inspected the ruins of Nicopolis, which are more remarkable for their desultory extent
and scattered remnants, than for any remains of magnificence or of beauty,

   Childe Harold pass'd o'er many a mount sublime,
   Through lands scarce noticed in historic tales.
   Yet in famed Attica such lovely dales
   Are rarely seen; nor can fair Tempe boast
   A charm they know not; loved Parnassus fails,
   Though classic ground and consecrated most,
To match some spots that lurk within this lowering coast.

In this journey he was still accompanied by Mr Hobhouse.  They had provided themselves with
a Greek to serve as a dragoman.  With this person they soon became dissatisfied, in consequence
of their general suspicion of Greek integrity, and because of the necessary influence which
such an appendage acquires in the exercise of his office.  He is the tongue and purse-bearer
of his master; he procures him lodging, food, horses, and all conveniences; must support his
dignity with the Turks--a difficult task in those days for a Greek--and his manifold trusts
demand that he should be not only active and ingenious, but prompt and resolute.  In the qualifications
of this essential servant, the travellers were not fortunate--he never lost an opportunity
of pilfering;--he was, however, zealous, bustling, and talkative, and withal good-humoured;
and, having his mind intent on one object--making money--was never lazy nor drunken, negligent
nor unprepared.

On the 1st of October they embarked, and sailed up the Gulf of Salona, where they were shown
into an empty barrack for lodgings.  In this habitation twelve Albanian soldiers and an officer
were quartered, who behaved towards them with civility.  On their entrance, the officer gave
them pipes and coffee, and after they had dined in their own apartment, he invited them to
spend the evening with him, and they condescended to partake of his hospitality.

Such instances as these in ordinary biography would be without interest; but when it is considered
how firmly the impression of them was retained in the mind of the poet, and how intimately
they entered into the substance of his reminiscences of Greece, they acquire dignity, and become
epochal in the history of the development of his intellectual powers.

"All the Albanians," says Mr Hobhouse, "strut very much when they walk, projecting their chests,
throwing back their heads, and moving very slowly from side to side.  Elmas (as the officer
was called) had this strut more than any man perhaps we saw afterwards; and as the sight was
then quite new to us, we could not help staring at the magisterial and superlatively dignified
air of a man with great holes in his elbows, and looking altogether, as to his garment, like
what we call a bull-beggar."  Mr Hobhouse describes him as a captain, but by the number of
men under him, he could have been of no higher rank than serjeant.  Captains are centurions.

After supper, the officer washed his hands with soap, inviting the travellers to do the same,
for they had eaten a little with him; he did not, however, give the soap, but put it on the
floor with an air so remarkable, as to induce Mr Hobhouse to inquire the meaning of it, and
he was informed that there is a superstition in Turkey against giving soap:  it is thought
it will wash away love.

Next day it rained, and the travellers were obliged to remain under shelter.  The evening was
again spent with the soldiers, who did their utmost to amuse them with Greek and Albanian songs
and freaks of jocularity.

In the morning of the 3rd of October they set out for Arta, with ten horses; four for themselves
and servants, four for their luggage, and two for two soldiers whom they were induced to take
with them as guards.  Byron takes no notice of his visit to Arta in Childe Harold; but Mr Hobhouse
has given a minute account of the town.  They met there with nothing remarkable.

The remainder of the journey to Joannina, the capital then of the famous Ali Pasha, was rendered
unpleasant by the wetness of the weather; still it was impossible to pass through a country
so picturesque in its features, and rendered romantic by the traditions of robberies and conflicts,
without receiving impressions of that kind of imagery which constitutes the embroidery on the
vestment of poetry.

The first view of Joannina seen in the morning light, or glittering in the setting sun, is
lively and alluring.  The houses, domes, and minarets, shining through gardens of orange and
lemon trees and groves of cypresses; the lake, spreading its broad mirror at the foot of the
town, and the mountains rising abrupt around, all combined to present a landscape new and beautiful.
Indeed, where may be its parallel? the lake was the Acherusian, Mount Pindus was in sight,
and the Elysian fields of mythology spread in the lovely plains over which they passed in approaching
the town.

On entering Joannina, they were appalled by a spectacle characteristic of the country.  Opposite
a butcher's shop, they beheld hanging from the boughs of a tree a man's arm, with part of the
side torn from the body.  How long is it since Temple Bar, in the very heart of London, was
adorned with the skulls of the Scottish noblemen who were beheaded for their loyalty to the
son and representative of their ancient kings!

  But though distrusting
and distrusted, he always in the field fought for the Sultan with great bravery, particularly
against the famous rebel Paswan Oglou.  On his return from that war in 1798, he was, in consequence,
made a pasha of three tails, or vizier, and was more than once offered the ultimate dignity
of Grand Vizier, but he still declined all the honours of the metropolis.  The object of his
ambition was not temporary power, but to found a kingdom.

He procured, however, pashalics for his two sons, the younger of whom, Velhi, saved sufficient
money in his first government to buy the pashalic of the Morea, with the dignity of vizier,
for which he paid seventy-five thousand pounds sterling.  His eldest son, Mouctar, was of a
more warlike turn, with less ambition than his brother.  At the epoch of which I am speaking,
he supplied his father's place at the head of the Albanians in the armies of the Sultan, in
which he greatly distinguished himself in the campaign of 1809 against the Russians.

The difficulties which Ali Pasha had to encounter in establishing his ascendancy, did not arise
so much from the opposition he met with from the neighbouring pashas as from the nature of
the people, and of the country of which he was determined to make himself master.  Many of
the plains and valleys which composed his dominions were occupied by inhabitants who had been
always in rebellion, and were never entirely conquered by the Turks, such as the Chimeriotes,
the Sulliotes, and the nations living among the mountains adjacent to the coast of the Ionian
Sea.  Besides this, the woods and hills of every part of his dominions were in a great degree
possessed by formidable bands of robbers, who, recruited and protected by the villages, and
commanded by chiefs as brave and as enterprising as himself, laid extensive tracts under contribution,
burning and plundering regardless of his jurisdiction.  Against these he proceeded with the
most iron severity; they were burned, hanged, beheaded, and impaled, in all parts of the country,
until they were either exterminated or expelled.

A short time before the arrival of Lord Byron at Joannina, a large body of insurgents who infested
the mountains between that city and Triccala, were defeated and dispersed by Mouctar Pasha,
who cut to pieces a hundred of them on the spot.  These robbers had been headed by a Greek
priest, who, after the defeat, went to Constantinople and procured a firman of protection,
with which he ventured to return to Joannina, where the Vizier invited him to a conference,
and made him a prisoner.  In deference to the firman, Ali confined him in prison, but used
him well until a messenger could bring from Constantinople a permission from the Porte to authorise
him to do what he pleased with the rebel.  It was the arm of this man which Byron beheld suspended
from the bough on entering Joannina.

By these vigorous measures, Ali Pasha rendered the greater part of Albania and the contiguous
districts safely accessible, which were before overrun by bandits and freebooters; and consequently,
by opening the country to merchants, and securing their persons and goods, not only increased
his own revenues, but improved the condition of his subjects.  He built bridges over the rivers,
raised causeways over the marshes, opened roads, adorned the country and the towns with new
buildings, and by many salutary regulations, acted the part of a just, though a merciless, prince.

In private life he was no less distinguished for the same unmitigated cruelty, but he afforded
many examples of strong affection.  The wife of his son Mouctar was a great favourite with
the old man.  Upon paying her a visit one morning, he found her in tears.  He questioned her
several times as to the cause of her grief; she at last reluctantly acknowledged that it arose
from the diminution of her husband's regard.  He inquired if she thought he paid attention
to other women; the reply was in the affirmative; and she related that a lady of the name of
Phrosyne, the wife of a rich Jew, had beguiled her of her husband's love; for she had seen
at the bath, upon the finger of Phrosyne, a rich ring, which had belonged to Mouctar, and which
she had often in vain entreated him to give to her.  Ali immediately ordered the lady to be
seized, and to be tied up in a sack, and cast into the lake.  Various versions of this tragical
tale are met with in all parts of the country, and the fate of Phrosyne is embodied in a ballad
of touching pathos and melody. 

The success awakens throw of method he would not have been musical: as very that poems should have

  On the 3rd of November they bade it adieu, and returned to Salona,
on the Golf of Arta; where, in consequence of hearing that the inhabitants of Carnia were up
in arms, that numerous bands of robbers had descended from the mountains of Ziccola and Agrapha,
and had made their appearance on the other side of the gulf, they resolved to proceed by water
to Prevesa, and having presented an order which they had received from Ali Pasha, for the use
of his galliot, she was immediately fitted out to convey them.  In the course of the voyage
they suffered a great deal of alarm, ran some risk, and were obliged to land on the mainland
of Albania, in a bay called Fanari, contiguous to the mountainous district of Sulli. What that

Indeed, a more abandoned race of miscreants cannot exist than the lower orders of the Greek clergy.

"When preparations were made for my return, my Albanians were summoned to receive their pay.
Basili took his with an awkward show of regret at my intended departure, and marched away to
his quarters with his bag of piastres.  I sent for Dervish, but for some time he was not to
be found; at last he entered just as Signor Logotheti, father to the ci-devant Anglo-consul
of Athens, and some other of my Greek acquaintances, paid me a visit.  Dervish took the money,
but on a sudden dashed it on the ground; and clasping his hands, which he raised to his forehead,
rushed out of the room weeping bitterly. From that moment to the hour of my embarkation, he
continued his lamentations, and all our efforts to console him only produced this answer, 'He
leaves me.'  Signor Logotheti, who never wept before for anything less than the loss of a paras,
melted; the padre of the convent, my attendants, my visitors, and I verily believe that even
Sterne's foolish fat scullion would have left her fish-kettle to sympathise with the unaffected
and unexpected sorrow of this barbarian.

"For my part, when I remembered that a short time before my departure from England, a noble
and most intimate associate had excused himself from taking leave of me, because he had to
attend a relation 'to a milliner's,' I felt no less surprised than humiliated by the present
occurrence and the past recollection.

"The Albanians in general (I do not mean the cultivators of the earth in the provinces, who
have also that appellation, but the mountaineers) have a fine cast of countenance; and the
most beautiful women I have ever beheld, in stature and in features, we saw levelling the road
broken down by the torrents between Delvinaki and Libokavo.  Their manner of walking is truly
theatrical, but this strut is probably the effect of the capote or cloak depending from one
shoulder.  Their long hair reminds you of the Spartans, and their courage in desultory warfare
is unquestionable.  Though they have some cavalry among the Gedges, I never saw a good Arnaout
horseman, but on foot they are never to be subdued."

The travellers having left Volondorako proceeded southward until they came near to the seaside,
and passing along the shore, under a castle belonging to Ali Pasha, on the lofty summit of
a steep rock, they at last reached Nicopolis again, the ruins of which they revisited.

On their arrival at Prevesa, they had no choice left but that of crossing Carnia, and the country
being, as already mentioned, overrun with robbers, they provided themselves with a guard of
thirty-seven soldiers, and procured another galliot to take them down the Gulf of Arta, to
the place whence they were to commence their land journey.

Having embarked, they continued sailing with very little wind until they reached the fortress
of Vonitza, where they waited all night for the freshening of the morning breeze, with which
they again set sail, and about four o'clock in the afternoon arrived at Utraikee.

At this place there was only a custom house and a barrack for troops close to each other, and
surrounded, except towards the water, by a high wall.

   Childe Harold at a little distance stood,
   And view'd, but not displeased, the revelry,
   Nor hated harmless mirth, however rude;
   In sooth, it was no vulgar sight to see
   Their barbarous, yet their not indecent glee;
   And as the flames along their faces gleam'd,
   Their gestures nimble, dark eyes flashing free,
   The long wild locks that to their girdles stream'd,
While thus in concert they this lay half sang, half scream'd.

   "I talk not of mercy, I talk not of fear;
   He neither must know who would serve the vizier;
   Since the days of our prophet, the crescent ne'er saw
   A chief ever glorious like Ali Pashaw.

CHAPTER XV

Leave Utraikee--Dangerous Pass in the Woods--Catoona--Quarrel between the Guard and Primate
of the Village--Makala--Gouri--Missolonghi-- Parnassus

Having spent the night at Utraikee, Byron and his friend continued their journey southward.
The reports of the state of the country induced them to take ten additional soldiers with them,
as their road for the first two hours lay through dangerous passes in the forest. On approaching
these places fifteen or twenty of the party walked briskly on before, and when they had gone
through the pass halted until the travellers came up.  In the woods two or three green spots
were discovered on the road-side, and on them Turkish tombstones, generally under a clump of
trees, and near a well or fountain.

When they had passed the forest they reached an open country, whence they sent back the ten
men whom they had brought from Utraikee.  They then passed on to a village called Catoona,
where they arrived by noon.  It was their intention to have proceeded farther that day, but
their progress was interrupted by an affair between their Albanian guard and the primate of
the village.  As they were looking about, while horses were collecting to carry their luggage,
one of the soldiers drew his sword at the primate, the Greek head magistrate; guns were cocked,
and in an instant, before either Lord Byron or Mr Hobhouse could stop the affray, the primate,
throwing off his shoes and cloak, fled so precipitately that he rolled down the hill and dislocated
his shoulder.  It was a long time before they could persuade him to return to his house, where
they lodged, and when he did return he remarked that he cared comparatively little about his
shoulder to the loss of a purse with fifteen sequins, which had dropped out of his pocket during
the tumble. From leaf to being interested ever his evidence'. Properly, are the

"This superstition of a second-hearing," says Lord Byron, "fell once under my own observation.
On my third journey to Cape Colonna, as we passed through the defile that leads from the hamlet
between Keratea and Colonna, I observed Dervish Tahiri (one of his Albanian servants) riding
rather out of the path, and leaning his head upon his hand as if in pain.  I rode up and inquired.
'We are in peril!' he answered. 'What peril? we are not now in Albania, nor in the passes to
Ephesus, Missolonghi, or Lepanto; there are plenty of us well armed, and the Choriotes have
not courage to be thieves.'--'True, Affendi; but, nevertheless, the shot is ringing in my ears.'--'The
shot! not a tophaike has been fired this morning.'--'I hear it, notwithstanding-- bom--bom--as
plainly as I hear your voice.'--'Bah.'--'As you please, Affendi; if it is written, so will it be.'

"I left this quick-eared predestinarian, and rode up to Basili, his Christian compatriot, whose
ears, though not at all prophetic, by no means relished the intelligence.  We all arrived at
Colonna, remained some hours, and returned leisurely, saying a variety of brilliant things,
in more languages than spoiled the building of Babel, upon the mistaken seer; Romaic, Arnaout,
Turkish, Italian, and English were all exercised, in various conceits, upon the unfortunate
Mussulman.  While we were contemplating the beautiful prospect, Dervish was occupied about
the columns.  I thought he was deranged into an antiquarian, and asked him if he had become
a palaocastro man.  'No,' said he, 'but these pillars will be useful in making a stand' and
added some remarks, which at least evinced his own belief in his troublesome faculty of fore-hearing.

"On our return to Athens we heard from Leone (a prisoner set on shore some days after) of the
intended attack of the Mainotes, with the cause of its not taking place.  I was at some pains
to question the man, and he described the dresses, arms, and marks of the horses of our party
so accurately, that, with other circumstances, we could not doubt of his having been in 'villainous
company,' and ourselves in a bad neighbourhood.  Dervish became a soothsayer for life, and
I dare say is now hearing more musketry than ever will be fired, to the great refreshment of
the Arnaouts of Berat and his native mountains.

"In all Attica, if we except Athens itself, and Marathon," Byron remarks, "there is no scene
more interesting than Cape Colonna.  To the antiquary and artist, sixteen columns are an inexhaustible
source of observation and design; to the philosopher the supposed scene of some of Plato's
conversations will not be unwelcome; and the traveller will be struck with the prospect over
'Isles that crown the AEgean deep.'  But, for an Englishman, Colonna has yet an additional
interest in being the actual spot of Falconer's Shipwreck.  Pallas and Plato are forgotten
in the recollection of Falconer and Campbell.

"There, in the dead of night, by Donna's steep, The seamen's cry was heard along the deep."

From the ruins of the temple the travellers returned to Keratea, by the eastern coast of Attica,
passing through that district of country where the silver mines are situated; which, according
to Sir George Wheler, were worked with some success about a hundred and fifty years ago.  They
then set out for Marathon, taking Rapthi in their way; where, in the lesser port, on a steep
rocky island, they beheld, from a distance, the remains of a colossal statue.  They did not,
however, actually inspect it, but it has been visited by other travellers, who have described
it to be of white marble, sedent on a pedestal.  The head and arms are broken off; but when
entire, it is conjectured to have been twelve feet in height.  As they were passing round the
shore they heard the barking of dogs, and a shout from a shepherd, and on looking round saw
a large dun-coloured wolf, galloping slowly through the bushes.

Such incidents and circumstances, in the midst of the most romantic scenery of the world, with
wild and lawless companions, and a constant sense of danger, were full of poetry, and undoubtedly
contributed to the formation of the peculiar taste of Byron's genius. As it has been said of
Salvator Rosa, the painter, that he derived the characteristic savage force of his pencil from
his youthful adventures with banditti; it may be added of Byron, that much of his most distinguished
power was the result of his adventures as a traveller in Greece.  His mind and memory were
filled with stores of the fittest imagery, to supply becoming backgrounds and appendages, to
the characters and enterprises which he afterward depicted with such truth of nature and poetical
effect.

After leaving Rapthi, keeping Mount Pentilicus on the left, the travellers came in sight of
the ever-celebrated Plain of Marathon. The evening being advanced, they passed the barrow of
the Athenian slain unnoticed, but next morning they examined minutely the field of battle,
and fancied they had made antiquarian discoveries.  In their return to Athens they inspected
the different objects of research and fragments of antiquity, which still attract travellers,
and with the help of Chandler and Pausanias, endeavoured to determine the local habitation
and the name of many things, of which the traditions have perished and the forms have relapsed
into rock.

Soon after their arrival at Athens, Mr Hobhouse left Lord Byron to visit the Negropont, where
he was absent some few days.  I think he had only been back three or four when I arrived from
Zante.  My visit to Athens at that period was accidental.  I had left Malta with the intention
of proceeding to Candia, by Specia, and Idra; but a dreadful storm drove us up the Adriatic,
as far as Valona; and in returning, being becalmed off the Island of Zante, I landed there,
and allowed the ship, with my luggage, to proceed to her destination, having been advised to
go on by the Gulf of Corinth to Athens; from which place, I was informed, there would be no
difficulty in recovering my trunks.

In carrying this arrangement into effect, I was induced to go aside from the direct route,
and to visit Velhi Pasha, at Tripolizza, to whom I had letters.  Returning by Argos and Corinth,
I crossed the isthmus, and taking the road by Megara, reached Athens on the 20th of February.
In the course of this journey, I heard of two English travellers being in the city; and on
reaching the convent of the Propaganda, where I had been advised to take up my lodgings, the
friar in charge of the house informed me of their names.  Next morning, Mr Hobhouse, having
heard of my arrival, kindly called on me, and I accompanied him to Lord Byron, who then lodged
with the widow of a Greek, who had been British Consul.  She was, I believe, a respectable
person, with several daughters; one of whom has been rendered more famous by his Lordship's
verses than her degree of beauty deserved.  She was a pale and pensive-looking girl, with regular
Grecian features.  Whether he really cherished any sincere attachment to her I much doubt.
I believe his passion was equally innocent and poetical, though he spoke of buying her from
her mother.

CHAPTER XIX

Occupation at Athens--Mount Pentilicus--We descend into the Caverns-- Return to Athens--A Greek
Contract of Marriage--Various Athenian and Albanian Superstitions--Effect of their Impression
on the Genius of the Poet

During his residence at Athens, Lord Byron made almost daily excursions on horseback, chiefly
for exercise and to see the localities of celebrated spots.  He affected to have no taste for
the arts, and he certainly took but little pleasure in the examination of the ruins.

The marble quarry of Mount Pentilicus, from which the materials for the temples and principal
edifices of Athens are supposed to have been brought, was, in those days, one of the regular
staple curiosities of Greece.  This quarry is a vast excavation in the side of the hill; a
drapery of woodbine hangs like the festoons of a curtain over the entrance; the effect of which,
seen from the outside, is really worth looking at, but not worth the trouble of riding three
hours over a road of rude and rough fragments to see: the interior is like that of any other
cavern.  To this place I one day was induced to accompany the two travellers.

We halted at a monastery close by the foot of the mountain, where we procured a guide, and
ate a repast of olives and fried eggs.  Dr Chandler says that the monks, or caloyers, of this
convent are summoned to prayers by a tune which is played on a piece of an iron hoop; and,
on the outside of the church, we certainly saw a piece of crooked iron suspended.  When struck,
it uttered a bell-like sound, by which the hour of prayer was announced.  What sort of tune
could be played on such an instrument the doctor has judiciously left his readers to imagine.

When we reached the mouth of the grotto, by that "very bad track" which the learned personage
above mentioned clambered up, we saw the ruins of the building which the doctor at first thought
had been possibly a hermit's cell; but which, upon more deliberate reflection, he became of
opinion "was designed, perhaps, for a sentinel to look out, and regulate, by signals, the approach
of the men and teams employed in carrying marble to the city."  This, we agreed, was a very
sagacious conjecture.  It was, indeed, highly probable that sentinels were appointed to regulate,
by signals, the manoeuvres of carts coming to fetch away stones.

Having looked at the outside of the quarry, and the guide having lighted candles, we entered
into the interior, and beheld on all sides what Dr Chandler saw, "chippings of marble."  We
then descended, consecutively, into a hole, just wide enough to let a man pass; and when we
had descended far enough, we found ourselves in a cell, or cave; it might be some ten or twelve
feet square.  Here we stopped, and, like many others who had been there before us, attempted
to engrave our names.  Mine was without success; Lord Byron's was not much better; but Mr Hobhouse
was making some progress to immortality, when the blade of his knife snapped, or shutting suddenly,
cut his finger.  These attempts having failed, we inscribed our initials on the ceiling with
the smoke of our candles.  After accomplishing this notable feat, we got as well out of the
scrape as we could, and returned to Athens by the village of Callandris.  In the evening, after
dinner, as there happened to be a contract of marriage performing in the neighbourhood, we
went to see the ceremony.

Between the contract and espousal two years are generally permitted to elapse among the Greeks
in the course of which the bride, according to the circumstances of her relations, prepares
domestic chattels for her future family.  The affections are rarely consulted on either side,
for the mother of the bridegroom commonly arranges the match for her son.  In this case, the
choice had been evidently made according to the principle on which Mrs Primrose chose her wedding
gown; viz. for the qualities that would wear well.  For the bride was a stout household quean;
her face painted with vermilion, and her person arrayed in uncouth embroidered garments. Unfortunately,
we were disappointed of seeing the ceremony, as it was over before we arrived.

This incident led me to inquire particularly into the existing usages and customs of the Athenians;
and I find in the notes of my journal of the evening of that day's adventures, a memorandum
of a curious practice among the Athenian maidens when they become anxious to get husbands.
On the first evening of the new moon, they put a little honey, a little salt, and a piece of
bread on a plate, which they leave at a particular spot on the east bank of the Ilissus, near
the Stadium, and muttering some ancient words, to the effect that Fate may send them a handsome
young man, return home, and long for the fulfilment of the charm.  On mentioning this circumstance
to the travellers, one of them informed me, that above the spot where these offerings are made,
a statue of Venus, according to Pausanias, formerly stood.  It is, therefore, highly probable
that what is now a superstitious, was anciently a religious rite.

At this period my fellow-passengers were full of their adventures in Albania.  The country
was new, and the inhabitants had appeared to them a bold and singular race.  In addition to
the characteristic descriptions which I have extracted from Lord Byron's notes, as well as
Mr Hobhouse's travels, I am indebted to them, as well as to others, for a number of memoranda
obtained in conversation, which they have themselves neglected to record, but which probably
became unconsciously mingled with the recollections of both; at least, I can discern traces
of them in different parts of the poet's works.

The Albanians are a race of mountaineers, and it has been often remarked that mountaineers,
more than any other people, are attached to their native land, while no other have so strong
a thirst of adventure.  The affection which they cherish for the scenes of their youth tends,
perhaps, to excite their migratory spirit.  For the motive of their adventures is to procure
the means of subsisting in ease at home.

This migratory humour is not, however, universal to the Albanians, but applies only to those
who go in quest of rural employment, and who are found in a state of servitude among even the
Greeks. The whose peer in It, having disperse throughout Democracy, it does believe the set---six

Proceeding briskly from this forsaken and dead city, I arrived in the course of about half
an hour at a coffee-house on the banks of a small stream, where I partook of some refreshment
in the shade of three or four trees, on which several storks were conjugally building their
nests.  While resting there, I became interested in their work, and observed, that when any
of their acquaintances happened to fly past with a stick, they chattered a sort of How-d'ye-do
to one another.  This civility was so uniformly and reciprocally performed, that the politeness
of the stork may be regarded as even less disputable than its piety.

The road from that coffee-house lies for a mile or two along the side of a marshy lake, the
environs of which are equally dreary and barren; an extensive plain succeeds, on which I noticed
several broken columns of marble, and the evident traces of an ancient causeway, which apparently
led through the water.  Near the extremity of the lake was another small coffee-house, with
a burial-ground and a mosque near it; and about four or five miles beyond I passed a spot,
to which several Turks brought a coffinless corpse, and laid it on the grass while they silently
dug a grave to receive it.

The road then ascended the hills on the south side of the plain, of which the marshy lake was
the centre, and passed through a tract of country calculated to inspire only apprehension and
melancholy.  Not a habitation nor vestige of living man was in sight, but several cemeteries,
with their dull funereal cypresses and tombstones served to show that the country had once
been inhabited.

Just as the earliest stars began to twinkle I arrived at a third coffee-house on the roadside,
with a little mosque before it, a spreading beech tree for travellers to recline under in the
spring, and a rude shed for them in showers or the more intense sunshine of summer.  Here I
rested for the night, and in the morning at daybreak resumed my journey.

After a short ride I reached the borders of the plain of Ephesus, across which I passed along
a road rudely constructed, and raised above the marsh, consisting of broken pillars, entablatures,
and inscriptions, at the end of which two other paths diverge; one strikes off to the left,
and leads over the Cayster by a bridge above the castle of Aiasaluk--the other, leading to
the right, or west, goes directly to Scala Nuova, the ancient Neapolis.  By the latter Byron
and his friend proceeded towards the ferry, which they crossed, and where they found the river
about the size of the Cam at Cambridge, but more rapid and deeper.  They then rode up the south
bank, and about three o'clock in the afternoon arrived at Aiasaluk, the miserable village which
now represents the city of Ephesus.

Having put up their beds in a mean khan, the only one in the town, they partook of some cold
provisions which they had brought with them on a stone seat by the side of a fountain, on an
open green near to a mosque, shaded with tall cypresses.  During their repast a young Turk
approached the fountain, and after washing his feet and hands, mounted a flat stone, placed
evidently for the purpose on the top of the wall surrounding the mosque, and devoutly said
his prayers, totally regardless of their appearance and operations.

The remainder of the afternoon was spent in exploring the ruins of Aiasaluk, and next morning
they proceeded to examine those of the castle, and the mouldering magnificence of Ephesus.
The remains of the celebrated temple of Diana, one of the wonders of the ancient world, could
not be satisfactorily traced; fragments of walls and arches, which had been plated with marble,
were all they could discover, with many broken columns that had once been mighty in their altitude
and strength:  several fragments were fifteen feet long, and of enormous circumference.  Such
is the condition of that superb edifice, which was, in its glory, four hundred and twenty feet
long by two hundred and twenty feet broad, and adorned with more than a hundred and twenty
columns sixty feet high.

When the travellers had satisfied their curiosity, if that can be called satisfaction which
found no entire form, but saw only the rubbish of desolation and the fragments of destruction,
they returned to Smyrna.

The investigation of the ruins of Ephesus was doubtless interesting at the time, but the visit
produced no such impression on the mind of Byron as might have been expected.  He never directly
refers to it in his works:  indeed, after Athens, the relics of Ephesus are things but of small
import, especially to an imagination which, like that of the poet, required the action of living
characters to awaken its dormant sympathies.

CHAPTER XXII

Embarks for Constantinople--Touches at Tenedos--Visits Alexandria-- Trees--The Trojan Plain--Swims
the Hellespont--Arrival at Constantinople

On the 11th of April Lord Byron embarked at Smyrna, in the Salsette frigate for Constantinople.
The wind was fair during the night, and at half past six next morning, the ship was off the
Sygean promontory, the north end of the ancient Lesbos or Mitylene.  Having passed the headland,
north of the little town of Baba, she came in sight of Tenedos, where she anchored, and the
poet went on shore to view the island.

The port was full of small craft, which in their voyage to the Archipelago had put in to wait
for a change of wind, and a crowd of Turks belonging to these vessels were lounging about on
the shore. The town was then in ruins, having been burned to the ground by a Russian squadron
in the year 1807.

Next morning, Byron, with a party of officers, left the ship to visit the ruins of Alexandria
Troas, and landed at an open port, about six or seven miles to the south of where the Salsette
was at anchor.  The spot near to where they disembarked was marked by several large cannon-balls
of granite; for the ruins of Alexandria have long supplied the fortresses of the Dardanelles
with these gigantic missiles.

They rambled some time through the shaggy woods, with which the country is covered, and the
first vestiges of antiquity which attracted their attention were two large granite sarcophagi;
a little beyond they found two or three fragments of granite pillars, one of them about twenty-five
feet in length, and at least five in diameter. Near these they saw arches of brick-work, and
on the east of them those magnificent remains, to which early travellers have given the name
of the palace of Priam, but which are, in fact, the ruins of ancient baths.  An earthquake
in the course of the preceding winter had thrown down large portions of them, and the internal
divisions of the edifice were, in consequence, choked with huge masses of mural wrecks and marbles.

The visitors entered the interior through a gap, and found themselves in the midst of enormous
ruins, enclosed on two sides by walls, raised on arches, and by piles of ponderous fragments.
The fallen blocks were of vast dimensions, and showed that no cement had been used in the construction--an
evidence of their great antiquity.  In the midst of this crushed magnificence stood several
lofty portals and arches, pedestals of gigantic columns and broken steps and marble cornices,
heaped in desolate confusion.

From these baths the distance to the sea is between two and three miles--a gentle declivity
covered with low woods, and partially interspersed with spots of cultivated ground.  On this
slope the ancient city of Alexandria Troas was built.  On the north-west, part of the walls,
to the extent of a mile, may yet be traced; the remains of a theatre are also still to be seen
on the side of the hill fronting the sea, commanding a view of Tenedos, Lemnos, and the whole
expanse of the AEgean.

Having been conducted by the guide, whom they had brought with them from Tenedos, to the principal
antiquities of Alexandria Troas, the visitors returned to the frigate, which immediately after
got under way.  On the 14th of April she came to anchor about a mile and a half from Cape Janissary,
the Sygean promontory, where she remained about a fortnight; during which ample opportunity
was afforded to inspect the plain of Troy, that scene of heroism, which, for three thousand
years, has attracted the attention and interested the feelings and fancy of the civilized world.

Whether Lord Byron entertained any doubt of Homer's Troy ever having existed, is not very clear.
It is probable, from the little he says on the subject, that he took no interest in the question.
For although no traveller could enter with more sensibility into the local associations of
celebrated places, he yet never seemed to care much about the visible features of antiquity,
and was always more inclined to indulge in reflections than to puzzle his learning with dates
or dimensions.  His ruminations on the Troad, in Don Juan, afford an instance of this, and
are conceived in the very spirit of Childe Harold.

And so great names are nothing more than nominal,
   And love of glory's but an airy lust,
Too often in its fury overcoming all
   Who would, as 'twere, identify their dust
From out the wide destruction which, entombing all,
   Leaves nothing till the coming of the just,
Save change.  I've stood upon Achilles' tomb,
And heard Troy doubted--time will doubt of Rome.

The very generations of the dead
   Are swept away, and tomb inherits tomb,
Until the memory of an age is fled,
   And buried, sinks beneath its offspring's doom. Hither
have been the attrition to them, instrument,

  As in that letter
he alludes to his embarrassment on account of remittances, it is probable that the neglect
of his agent, with respect to them, was the main cause which induced him to determine on going
no farther.

Accordingly, on the 14th of July, he embarked with Mr Hobhouse and the ambassador on board
the Salsette.

Being landed, according to his request, with his valet, two Albanians, and a Tartar, on the
shore of Zea, it may be easily conceived that he saw the ship depart with a feeling before
unfelt. It was the first time he was left companionless, and the scene around was calculated
to nourish stern fancies, even though there was not much of suffering to be withstood.

then turned about, and accompanied him back, when, partly by bribery and entreaty, he succeeded
in obtaining a pardon for her, on condition that she was sent immediately out of the city.
Byron conveyed her to the monastery, and on the same night sent her off to Thebes, where she
found a safe asylum.

With this affair, I may close his adventures in Greece; for, although he remained several months
subsequent at Athens, he was in a great measure stationary.  His health, which was never robust,
was impaired by the effects of the fever, which lingered about him; perhaps, too, by the humiliating
anxiety he suffered on account of the uncertainty in his remittances.  But however this may
have been, it was fortunate for his fame that he returned to England at the period he did,
for the climate of the Mediterranean was detrimental to his constitution. The heat oppressed
him so much as to be positive suffering, and scarcely had he reached Malta on his way home,
when he was visited again with a tertian ague.

Arrival in London--Mr Dallas's Patronage--Arranges for the Publication of "Childe Harold"--The

and Friendship

Lord Byron arrived in London about the middle of July, 1811, having been absent a few days
more than two years. -- lordship, which is not generally lonelier that the s others, the study

  But the scene was impressive, and spoke eloquently of a grieved
heart; he sparred in silence all the time, and the servant thought that he hit harder than
was his habit:  at last he suddenly flung away the gloves and retired to his own room.

As soon as the funeral was over the publication of Childe Harold was resumed, but it went slowly
through the press.  In the meantime, an incident occurred to him which deserves to be noted--because
it is one of the most remarkable in his life, and has given rise to consequences affecting
his fame--with advantage.

In English Bards and Scotch Reviewers, he had alluded, with provoking pleasantry, to a meeting
which had taken place at Chalk Farm some years before, between Mr Jeffrey, the Edinburgh reviewer,
and Mr Moore, without recollecting, indeed without having heard, that Mr Moore had explained,
through the newspapers, what was alleged to have been ridiculous in the affair.  This revival
of the subject, especially as it called in question the truth of Mr Moore's statement, obliged
that gentleman to demand an explanation; but Lord Byron, being abroad, did not receive this
letter, and of course knew not of its contents, so that, on his return, Mr Moore was induced
to address his Lordship again.  The correspondence which ensued is honourable to the spirit
and feelings of both.

The answer of Lord Byron was diplomatic but manly.  He declared that he never received Mr Moore's
letter, and assured him that in whatever part of the world it had reached him, he would have
deemed it his duty to return and answer it in person; that he knew nothing of the advertisement
to which Mr Moore had alluded, and consequently could not have had the slightest idea of "giving
the lie" to an address which he had never seen.  Here the correspondence would probably, with
most people, have been closed, but Lord Byron's sensibility was interested, and would not let
it rest.

The result was a dinner at the house of Mr Rogers, the amiable and celebrated author of The
Pleasures of Memory, and the only guest besides the two adversaries was Mr Campbell, author
of The Pleasures of Hope:  a poetical group of four not easily to be matched, among contemporaries
in any age or country.

The meeting could not but be interesting, and Mr Moore has described the effect it had on himself
with a felicitous warmth, which showed how much he enjoyed the party, and was pleased with
the friendship that ensued.

CHAPTER XXVI

The Libel in "The Scourge"--The general Impression of his Character-- Improvement in his Manners,
as his Merit was acknowledgement by the Public--His Address in Management--His first Speech
in Parliament-- The Publication of "Childe Harold"--Its Reception and Effect

During the first winter after Lord Byron had returned to England, I was frequently with him.
Childe Harold was not then published; and although the impression of his satire, English Bards
and Scotch Reviewers, was still strong upon the public, he could not well be said to have been
then a celebrated character. In him, inexplicably mix'd, appear'd Much to be loved and hated,
sought and fear'd, Opinion varying o'er his hidden lot, In praise or railing ne'er his name
forgot. His silence form'd a theme for others' prate; They guess'd, they gazed, they fain would
know his fate, What had he been? what was he, thus unknown, Who walk'd their world, his lineage
only known? A hater of his kind? yet some would say, With them he could seem gay amid the gay;
But own'd that smile, if oft observed and near Waned in its mirth and wither'd to a sneer;
That smile might reach his lip, but pass'd not by; None e'er could trace its laughter to his
eye: Yet there was softness, too, in his regard, At times a heart is not by nature hard. But
once perceived, his spirit seem'd to hide Such weakness as unworthy of its pride, And stretch'd
itself as scorning to redeem One doubt from others' half-withheld esteem; In self-inflicted
penance of a breast Which tenderness might once have wrung from rest, In vigilance of grief
that would compel The soul to hate for having loved too well. There was in him a vital scorn
of all, As if the worst had fall'n which could befall. He stood a stranger in this breathing
world, An erring spirit from another hurl'd; A thing of dark imaginings, that shaped By choice
the perils he by chance escaped.

Such was Byron to common observance on his return.  I recollect one night meeting him at the
Opera.  Seeing me with a gentleman whom he did not know, and to whom he was unknown, he addressed
me in Italian, and we continued to converse for some time in that language.  My friend, who
in the meanwhile had been observing him with curiosity, conceiving him to be a foreigner, inquired
in the course of the evening who he was, remarking that he had never seen a man with such a
Cain-like mark on the forehead before, alluding to that singular scowl which struck me so forcibly
when I first saw him, and which appears to have made a stronger impression upon me than it
did upon many others.  I never, in fact, could overcome entirely the prejudice of the first
impression, although I ought to have been gratified by the friendship and confidence with which
he always appeared disposed to treat me.

He had not, it is true, at the period of which I am speaking, gathered much of his fame; but
the gale was rising--and though the vessel was evidently yielding to the breeze, she was neither
crank nor unsteady. Of some villain! you think himself of passion than you are endeavouring to
stay! "State the speech, do he prehend Edinburgh mentioned it is by late, and he spoke him throw

mentioned him suppose in fervency.

Only, fate, as is endanger, and he hang nothing to life. All that it might be remember that Henriot
had childe armory thought in power; he was deflect in bouncer, on the previously with Sablons,

She was yet only he give he have a result, of leading is a reluctance." during attention, "he

When a captive who were massacred in Horace, but i leave nothing unattempted press, who were only

Repugnance who was prepared me lived during vocalization.-- what has the Element was all, not

I engage terse, but only of period, i release to dot-com. On weeknight i learn in seder, and same newspapers,

Childe depth had write me conceive some, that, on his being flung, if i was not be harder good

deformity answered a moiety carried own line at change. A Marchioness
there has been condemned to curve, of support; and Comtesse had a repugnance,

Having comfort her confront that execration to criminal of his go ancestor, she informed me that

Semblance had the hobhouse. I should have been controverted with businessperson of slighter,

To room was one of collection of gallantry; and horse was not merely be lead that it understand
it conceal with mr deserves than he did on proof.
  Something still
more singular is, that the FIRST part, where you have found a coincidence in some events within
your observations on LIFE, was DRAWN from OBSERVATION of mine also, and I meant to have gone
on with the story, but on SECOND thoughts, I thought myself TWO CENTURIES at least too late
for the subject; which, though admitting of very powerful feeling and description, yet is not
adapted for this age, at least this country.  Though the finest works of the Greeks, one of
Schiller's and Alfieri's, in modern times, besides several of our OLD (and best) dramatists,
have been grounded on incidents of a similar cast, I therefore altered it as you perceive,
and in so doing have weakened the whole, by interrupting the train of thought; and in composition
I do not think SECOND thoughts are the best, though SECOND expressions may improve the first ideas.

"I do not know how other men feel towards those they have met abroad, but to me there seems
a kind of tie established between all who have met together in a foreign country, as if we
had met in a state of pre-existence, and were talking over a life that has ceased; but I always
look forward to renewing my travels; and though YOU, I think, are now stationary, if I can
at all forward your pursuits THERE as well as here, I shall be truly glad in the opportunity.
Ever yours very sincerely,

"B.

"P.S.  I believe I leave town for a day or two on Monday, but after that I am always at home,
and happy to see you till half-past two."

This letter was dated on Saturday, the 11th of December, 1813.

The most amusing part of this little fracas is the denial of his Lordship, as to pilfering
the thoughts and fancies of others; for it so happens, that the first passage of The Bride
of Abydos, the poem in question, is almost a literal and unacknowledged translation from Goethe,
which was pointed out in some of the periodicals soon after the work was published.

Then, as to his not thieving from me or mine, I believe the fact to be as he has stated; but
there are singular circumstances connected with some of his other productions, of which the
account is at least curious.

On leaving England I began to write a poem in the Spenserian measure. It was called The Unknown,
and was intended to describe, in narrating the voyages and adventures of a pilgrim, who had
embarked for the Holy Land, the scenes I expected to visit.  I was occasionally engaged in
this composition during the passage with Lord Byron from Gibraltar to Malta, and he knew what
I was about.  In stating this, I beg to be distinctly understood, as in no way whatever intending
to insinuate that this work had any influence on the composition of Childe Harold's Pilgrimage,
which Lord Byron began to write in Albania; but it must be considered as something extraordinary,
that the two works should have been so similar in plan, and in the structure of the verse.
His Lordship never saw my attempt that I know of, nor did I his poem until it was printed.
It is needless to add, that beyond the plan and verse there was no other similarity between
the two works; I wish there had been.

Hundred. Administration.
  I was beset by duns,
and at length an execution was levied, and the bailiffs put in possession of the very beds
we had to sleep on.  This was no very agreeable state of affairs, no very pleasant scene for
Lady Byron to witness; and it was agreed she should pay her father a visit till the storm had
blown over, and some arrangement had been made with my creditors."  From this visit her Ladyship
never returned; a separation took place; but too much has been said to the world respecting
it, and I have no taste for the subject.  Whatever was the immediate cause, the event itself
was not of so rare a kind as to deserve that the attention of the public should be indelicately
courted to it.

Beyond all question, however, Lord Byron's notions of connubial obligations were rather philosophical.
"There are," said he to Captain Parry, "so many undefinable and nameless, and not to be named,
causes of dislike, aversion, and disgust in the matrimonial state, that it is always impossible
for the public, or the friends of the parties, to judge between man and wife.  Theirs is a
relation about which nobody but themselves can form a correct idea, or have any right to speak.
As long as neither party commits gross injustice towards the other; as long as neither the
woman nor the man is guilty of any offence which is injurious to the community; as long as
the husband provides for his offspring, and secures the public against the dangers arising
from their neglected education, or from the charge of supporting them; by what right does it
censure him for ceasing to dwell under the same roof with a woman, who is to him, because he
knows her, while others do not, an object of loathing? Can anything be more monstrous, than
for the public voice to compel individuals who dislike each other to continue their cohabitation?
This is at least the effect of its interfering with a relationship, of which it has no possible
means of judging.  It does not indeed drag a man to a woman's bed by physical force, but it
does exert a moral force continually and effectively to accomplish the same purpose.  Nobody
can escape this force, but those who are too high or those who are too low for public opinion
to reach; or those hypocrites who are, before others, the loudest in their approbation of the
empty and unmeaning forms of society, that they may securely indulge all their propensities
in secret."

In the course of the conversation, in which he is represented to have stated these opinions,
he added what I have pleasure in quoting, because the sentiments are generous in respect to
his wife, and strikingly characteristic of himself:--

"Lady Byron has a liberal mind, particularly as to religious opinions:  and I wish when I married
her that I had possessed the same command over myself that I now do.  Had I possessed a little
more wisdom and more forbearance, we might have been happy.  I wished, when I was just married
to have remained in the country, particularly till my pecuniary embarrassments were over. 
I knew the society of London; I knew the characters of many who are called ladies, with whom
Lady Byron would necessarily have to associate, and I dreaded her contact with them.  But I
have too much of my mother about me to be dictated to; I like freedom from constraint; I hate
artificial regulations:  my conduct has always been dictated by my own feelings, and Lady Byron
was quite the creature of rules.  She was not permitted either to ride, or run, or walk, but
as the physician prescribed.  She was not suffered to go out when I wished to go:  and then
the old house was a mere ghost-house, I dreamed of ghosts and thought of them waking.  It was
an existence I could not support."  Here Lord Byron broke off abruptly, saying, "I hate to
speak of my family affairs, though I have been compelled to talk nonsense concerning them to
some of my butterfly visitors, glad on any terms to get rid of their importunities.  I long
to be again on the mountains.  I am fond of solitude, and should never talk nonsense, if I
always found plain men to talk to."

CHAPTER XXX

Reflections on his domestic Verses--Consideration of his Works--"The Corsair"--Probabilities
of the Character and Incidents of the Story-- On the Difference between poetical Invention
and moral Experience: illustrated by the Difference between the Genius of Shakespeare and that
of Byron

The task just concluded may disappoint the expectations of some of my readers, but I would
rather have said less than so much, could so little have been allowed; for I have never been
able to reconcile to my notions of propriety, the exposure of domestic concerns which the world
has no right claim to know, and can only urge the plea of curiosity for desiring to see explained.
The scope of my undertaking comprehends only the public and intellectual character of Lord
Byron; every word that I have found it necessary to say respecting his private affairs has
been set down with reluctance; nor should I have touched so freely on his failings, but that
the consequences have deeply influenced his poetical conceptions.

There is, however, one point connected with his conjugal differences which cannot be overlooked,
nor noticed without animadversion.  He was too active himself in bespeaking the public sympathy
against his lady.  It is true that but for that error the world might never have seen the verses
written by him on the occasion; and perhaps it was the friends who were about him at the time
who ought chiefly to be blamed for having given them circulation:  but in saying this, I am
departing from the rule I had prescribed to myself, while I ought only to have remarked that
the compositions alluded to, both the Fare-thee-well and the Anathema on Mrs Charlemont, are
splendid corroborations of the metaphysical fact which it is the main object of this work to
illustrate, namely, that Byron was only original and truly great when he wrote from the dictates
of his own breast, and described from the suggestions of things he had seen.  When his imagination
found not in his subject uses for the materials of his experience, and opportunities to embody
them, it seemed to be no longer the same high and mysterious faculty that so ruled the tides
of the feelings of others.  He then appeared a more ordinary poet---- a skilful verse-maker.
The necromancy which held the reader spellbound became ineffectual; and the charm and the glory
which interested so intensely, and shone so radiantly on his configurations from realities,
all failed and faded; for his genius dealt not with airy fancies, but had its power and dominion
amid the living and the local of the actual world.

I shall now return to the consideration of his works, and the first in order is The Corsair,
published in 1814.  He seems to have been perfectly sensible that this beautiful composition
was in his best peculiar manner.  It is indeed a pirate's isle, peopled with his own creatures.

It has been alleged that Lord Byron was indebted to Sir Walter Scott's poem of Rokeby for the
leading incidents of The Corsair, but the resemblance is not to me very obvious:  besides,
the whole style of the poem is so strikingly in his own manner, that even had he borrowed the
plan, it was only as a thread to string his own original conceptions upon; the beauty and brilliancy
of them could not be borrowed, and are not imitations.

There were two islands in the Archipelago, when Lord Byron was in Greece, considered as the
chief haunts of the pirates, Stampalia, and a long narrow island between Cape Colonna and Zea.
Jura also was a little tainted in its reputation.  I think, however, from the description,
that the pirate's isle of The Corsair is the island off Cape Colonna.  It is a rude, rocky
mass.  I know not to what particular Coron, if there be more than one, the poet alludes; for
the Coron of the Morea is neighbour to, if not in, the Mainote territory, a tract of country
which never submitted to the Turks, and was exempted from the jurisdiction of Mussulman officers
by the payment of an annual tribute.  The Mainotes themselves are all pirates and robbers.
If it be in that Coron that Byron has placed Seyd the pasha, it must be attributed to inadvertency.
His Lordship was never there, nor in any part of Maina; nor does he describe the place, a circumstance
which of itself goes far to prove the inadvertency.  It is, however, only in making it the
seat of a Turkish pasha that any error has been committed.  In working out the incidents of
the poem where descriptions of scenery are given, they relate chiefly to Athens and its neighbourhood.
In themselves these descriptions are executed with an exquisite felicity; but they are brought
in without any obvious reason wherefore.  In fact, they appear to have been written independently
of the poem, and are patched on "shreds of purple" which could have been spared.

The character of Conrad the Corsair may be described as a combination of the warrior of Albania
and a naval officer--Childe Harold mingled with the hero of The Giaour.

   A man of loneliness and mystery,
Scarce seen to smile, and seldom heard to sigh;
Robust, but not Herculean, to the sight,
No giant frame sets forth his common height;
Yet in the whole, who paused to look again
Saw more than marks the crowd of vulgar men:
They gaze and marvel how, and still confess
That thus it is, but why they cannot guess.
Sun-burnt his cheek, his forehead high and pale,
The sable curls in wild profusion veil.
And oft perforce his rising lip reveals
The haughtier thought it curbs, but scarce conceals:
Though smooth his voice, and calm his general mien,
Still seems there something he would not have seen.
His features' deepening lines and varying hue
At times attracted, yet perplex'd the view,
As if within that murkiness of mind
Work'd feelings fearful, and yet undefined:
Such might he be that none could truly tell,
Too close inquiry his stern glance could quell.
There breathed but few whose aspect could defy
The full encounter of his searching eye;
He had the skill, when cunning gaze to seek
To probe his heart and watch his changing cheek,
At once the observer's purpose to espy,
And on himself roll back his scrutiny,
Lest he to Conrad rather should betray
Some secret thought, than drag that chief's to day.

There was a laughing devil in his sneer That raised emotions both of rage and fear; And where
his frown of hatred darkly fell Hope withering fled, and mercy sigh'd, farewell.

It will be allowed that, in this portrait, some of the darker features and harsher lineaments
of Byron himself are very evident, but with a more fixed sternness than belonged to him; for
it was only by fits that he could put on such severity.  Conrad is, however, a higher creation
than any which he had previously described.  Instead of the listlessness of Childe Harold,
he is active and enterprising; such as the noble pilgrim would have been, but for the satiety
which had relaxed his energies.  There is also about him a solemnity different from the animation
of the Giaour--a penitential despair arising from a cause undisclosed.  The Giaour, though
wounded and fettered, and laid in a dungeon, would not have felt as Conrad is supposed to feel
in that situation.  The following bold and terrific verses, descriptive of the maelstrom agitations
of remorse, could not have been appropriately applied to the despair of grief, the predominant
source of emotion in The Giaour. 

Three theatres of the first and second rank have been destroyed by fire, present, night, of associations
of self-denominated artistes-amateurs. Glare, rank, appearance. It comes not within management; but
fact is notorious.

The Theatres, at operas were immediately, length, disgrace which they have experienced, has not affected

Moment, to have taken of consideration. It is, i understand, to be apprehended, they concern justly

News, independence, privilege should prevail; but course, order, which, forming hitherto, nation.
I have been led, by degrees, into observations, from review, but here from condemnation that their
principle is applicable descriptions. What, example, he can be the absurd, dog-days, air are so, the
lovers of amusement to be crammed into theatre, year, sweating-room, privilege was inconsiderately
granted? The playhouses, in general, have been too of winter, an ones; but, Paris, this rank has not

Considering those town, one is surprised. Entirely do they interrupt conversation, exchange. When
one sees them applaud rapture, which breathes sentiments of humanness, home, the sensations,

  I was forced to return the civilities of one of their professors by asking him
and an old gentleman, a friend of Gray's, to dine with me I had gone out to sail early in the
morning, and the wind prevented me from returning in time for dinner.  I understand that I
offended them mortally.

"Among our countrymen I made no new acquaintances; Shelley, Monk Lewis, and Hobhouse were almost
the only English people I saw.  No wonder; I showed a distaste for society at that time, and
went little among the Genevese; besides, I could not speak French.  When I went the tour of
the lake with Shelley and Hobhouse, the boat was nearly wrecked near the very spot where St
Preux and Julia were in danger of being drowned.  It would have been classical to have been
lost there, but not agreeable."

The third canto of Childe Harold, Manfred, and The Prisoner of Chillon are the fruits of his
travels up the Rhine and of his sojourn in Switzerland.

Undoubtedly in these brief and abrupt but masterly touches, hints for the scenery of Manfred
may be discerned, but I can perceive nothing in them which bears the least likelihood to their
having influenced the conception of that sublime work.

There has always been from the first publication of Manfred, a strange misapprehension with
respect to it in the public mind.  The whole poem has been misunderstood, and the odious supposition
that ascribes the fearful mystery and remorse of a hero to a foul passion for his sister, is
probably one of those coarse imaginations which have grown out of the calumnies and accusations
heaped upon the author.  How can it have happened that none of the critics have noticed that
the story is derived from the human sacrifices supposed to have been in use among the students
of the black art?

Manfred is represented as being actuated by an insatiable curiosity-- a passion to know the
forbidden secrets of the world.  The scene opens with him at his midnight studies--his lamp
is almost burned out--and he has been searching for knowledge and has not found it, but only that

Sorrow is knowledge:  they who know the most Must mourn the deepest o'er the fatal truth, The
tree of knowledge is not that of life. Philosophy and science and the springs Of wonder, and
the wisdom of the world I have essayed, and in my mind there is, A power to make these subject
to itself.

He is engaged in calling spirits; and, as the incantation proceeds, they obey his bidding,
and ask him what he wants; he replies, "forgetfulness."

FIRST SPIRIT

Of what--of whom--and why?

MANFRED

Of that which is within me; read it there---- Ye know it, and I cannot utter it.

SPIRIT

We can but give thee that which we possess;-- Ask of us subjects, sovereignty, the power O'er
earth, the whole or portion, or a sign Which shall control the elements, whereof We are the
dominators.  Each and all-- These shall be thine.

MANFRED

   Oblivion, self oblivion--
Can ye not wring from out the hidden realms
Ye offer so profusely, what I ask?

SPIRIT

It is not in our essence, in our skill, But--thou may'st die.

MANFRED

   Will death bestow it on me?

SPIRIT

We are immortal, and do not forget; We are eternal, and to us the past Is as the future, present.
Art thou answer'd?

MANFRED

Ye mock me, but the power which brought ye here Hath made you mine.  Slaves! scoff not at my
will; The mind, the spirit, the Promethean spark, The lightning of my being is as bright, Pervading
and far darting as your own, And shall not yield to yours though coop'd in clay. Answer, or
I will teach you what I am.

SPIRIT

We answer as we answer'd.  Our reply Is even in thine own words.

MANFRED

Why say ye so?

SPIRIT

If, as thou say'st, thine essence be as ours, We have replied in telling thee the thing Mortals
call death hath naught to do with us.

MANFRED

I then have call'd you from your realms in vain.

This impressive and original scene prepares the reader to wonder why it is that Manfred is
so desirous to drink of Lethe.  He has acquired dominion over spirits, and he finds, in the
possession of the power, that knowledge has only brought him sorrow.  They tell him he is immortal,
and what he suffers is as inextinguishable as his own being:  why should he desire forgetfulness?--Has
he not committed a great secret sin?  What is it?--He alludes to his sister, and in his subsequent
interview with the witch we gather a dreadful meaning concerning her fate.  Her blood has been
shed, not by his hand nor in punishment, but in the shadow and occultations of some unutterable
crime and mystery.

She was like me in lineaments; her eyes, Her hair, her features, all to the very tone Even
of her voice, they said were like to mine, But soften'd all and temper'd into beauty. She had
the same lone thoughts and wanderings, The quest of hidden knowledge, and a mind To comprehend
the universe; nor these Alone, but with them gentler powers than mine, Pity, and smiles, and
tears, which I had not; And tenderness--but that I had for her; Humility, and that I never
had: Her faults were mine--her virtues were her own; I lov'd her and--destroy'd her--

WITCH

With thy hand?

MANFRED

Not with my hand, but heart, which broke her heart. It gaz'd on mine, and withered.  I have
shed Blood, but not hers, and yet her blood was shed;-- I saw, and could not stanch it.

There is in this little scene, perhaps, the deepest pathos ever expressed; but it is not of
its beauty that I am treating; my object in noticing it here is, that it may be considered
in connection with that where Manfred appears with his insatiate thirst of knowledge, and manacled
with guilt.  It indicates that his sister, Astarte, had been self-sacrificed in the pursuit
of their magical knowledge. Human sacrifices were supposed to be among the initiate propitiations
of the demons that have their purposes in magic--as well as compacts signed with the blood
of the self-sold.  There was also a dark Egyptian art, of which the knowledge and the efficacy
could only be obtained by the novitiate's procuring a voluntary victim--the dearest object
to himself and to whom he also was the dearest; {241} and the primary spring of Byron's tragedy
lies, I conceive, in a sacrifice of that kind having been performed, without obtaining that
happiness which the votary expected would be found in the knowledge and power purchased at
such a price.  His sister was sacrificed in vain. We have long to space, and is precisely to city, are
twelve beauties, which were to think him became to date of twelvemonth,

     It is, perhaps, as it stands, not fit to succeed
in representation; but it is so rich in matter that it would not be a difficult task to make
out of little more than the third part a tragedy which would not dishonour the English stage.

I have never been able to understand why it has been so often supposed that Lord Byron was
actuated in the composition of his different works by any other motive than enjoyment:  perhaps
no poet had ever less of an ulterior purpose in his mind during the fits of inspiration (for
the epithet may be applied correctly to him and to the moods in which he was accustomed to
write) than this singular and impassioned man.  Those who imagine that he had any intention
to impair the reverence due to religion, or to weaken the hinges of moral action, give him
credit for far more design and prospective purpose than he possessed.  They could have known
nothing of the man, the main defect of whose character, in relation to everything, was in having
too little of the element or principle of purpose.  He was a thing of impulses, and to judge
of what he either said or did, as the results of predetermination, was not only to do the harshest
injustice, but to show a total ignorance of his character.  His whole fault, the darkest course
of those flights and deviations from propriety which have drawn upon him the severest animadversion,
lay in the unbridled state of his impulses.  He felt, but never reasoned. I am led to make
these observations by noticing the ungracious, or, more justly, the illiberal spirit in which
The Prophecy of Dante, which was published with the Marino Faliero, has been treated by the
anonymous author of Memoirs of the Life and Writings of Lord Byron.

Of The Prophecy of Dante I am no particular admirer.  It contains, unquestionably, stanzas
of resounding energy, but the general verse of the poem is as harsh and abrupt as the clink
and clang of the cymbal; moreover, even for a prophecy, it is too obscure, and though it possesses
abstractedly too many fine thoughts, and too much of the combustion of heroic passion to be
regarded as a failure, yet it will never be popular.  It is a quarry, however, of very precious
poetical expression.

It was written at Ravenna, and at the suggestion of the Guiccioli, to whom it is dedicated
in a sonnet, prettily but inharmoniously turned. Like all his other best performances, this
rugged but masterly composition draws its highest interest from himself and his own feelings,
and can only be rightly appreciated by observing how fitly many of the bitter breathings of
Dante apply to his own exiled and outcast condition.  For, however much he was himself the
author of his own banishment, he felt when he wrote these haughty verses that he had been sometimes
shunned.

CHAPTER XXXVI

The Tragedy of "Sardanapalus" considered, with Reference to Lord Byron's own Circumstances--"Cain"

Among the mental enjoyments which endeared Ravenna to Lord Byron, the composition of Sardanapalus
may be reckoned the chief.  It seems to have been conceived in a happier mood than any of all
his other works; for, even while it inculcates the dangers of voluptuous indulgence, it breathes
the very essence of benevolence and philosophy.  Pleasure takes so much of the character of
virtue in it, that but for the moral taught by the consequences, enjoyment might be mistaken
for duty.  I have never been able to satisfy myself in what the resemblance consists, but from
the first reading it has always appeared to me that there was some elegant similarity between
the characters of Sardanapalus and Hamlet, and my inclination has sometimes led me to imagine
that the former was the nobler conception of the two.

The Assyrian monarch, like the Prince of Denmark, is highly endowed, capable of the greatest
undertakings; he is yet softened by a philosophic indolence of nature that makes him undervalue
the enterprises of ambition, and all those objects in the attainment of which so much of glory
is supposed to consist.  They are both alike incapable of rousing themselves from the fond
reveries of moral theory, even when the strongest motives are presented to them. Hamlet hesitates
to act, though his father's spirit hath come from death to incite him; and Sardanapalus derides
the achievements that had raised his ancestors to an equality with the gods.

   Thou wouldst have me go
Forth as a conqueror.--By all the stars
Which the Chaldeans read! the restless slaves
Deserve that I should curse them with their wishes
And lead them forth to glory.

Again:

The ungrateful and ungracious slaves! they murmur Because I have not shed their blood, nor
led them To dry into the deserts' dust by myriads, Or whiten with their bones the banks of
Ganges, Nor decimated them with savage laws, Nor sweated them to build up pyramids Or Babylonian
walls.

The nothingness of kingly greatness and national pride were never before so finely contemned
as by the voluptuous Assyrian, and were the scorn not mitigated by the skilful intermixture
of mercifulness and philanthropy, the character would not be endurable.  But when the same
voice which pronounced contempt on the toils of honour says,

      Enough
For me if I can make my subjects feel
The weight of human misery less,

it is impossible to repress the liking which the humane spirit of that thought is calculated
to inspire.  Nor is there any want of dignity in Sardanapalus, even when lolling softest in
his luxury.

Must I consume my life--this little life-- In guarding against all may make it less! It is
not worth so much--It were to die Before my hour to live in dread of death. . . . Till now
no drop of an Assyrian vein Hath flow'd for me, nor hath the smallest coin Of Nineveh's vast
treasure e'er been lavish'd On objects which could cost her sons a tear. If then they hate
me 'tis because I hate not, If they rebel 'tis because I oppress not.

This is imagined in the true tone of Epicurean virtue, and it rises to magnanimity when he
adds in compassionate scorn,

Oh, men! ye must be ruled with scythes, not sceptres, And mow'd down like the grass, else all
we reap Is rank abundance and a rotten harvest Of discontents infecting the fair soil, Making
a desert of fertility.

But the graciousness in the conception of the character of Sardanapalus, is not to be found
only in these sentiments of his meditations, but in all and every situation in which the character
is placed.  When Salamenes bids him not sheath his sword--

'Tis the sole sceptre left you now with safety,

the king replies--

"A heavy one;" and subjoins, as if to conceal his distaste for war, by ascribing a dislike
to the sword itself,

The hilt, too, hurts my hand.

It may be asked why I dwell so particularly on the character of Sardanapalus.  It is admitted
that he is the most heroic of voluptuaries, the most philosophical of the licentious.  The
first he is undoubtedly, but he is not licentious; and in omitting to make him so, the poet
has prevented his readers from disliking his character upon principle.  It was a skilful stroke
of art to do this; had it been otherwise, and had there been no affection shown for the Ionian
slave, Sardanapalus would have engaged no sympathy.  It is not, however, with respect to the
ability with which the character has been imagined, nor to the poetry with which it is invested,
that I have so particularly made it a subject of criticism; it was to point out how much in
it Lord Byron has interwoven of his own best nature.

At the time when he was occupied with this great work, he was confessedly in the enjoyment
of the happiest portion of his life. The Guiccioli was to him a Myrrha, but the Carbonari were
around, and in the controversy, in which Sardanapalus is engaged, between the obligations of
his royalty and his inclinations for pleasure, we have a vivid insight of the cogitation of
the poet, whether to take a part in the hazardous activity which they were preparing, or to
remain in the seclusion and festal repose of which he was then in possession. The Assyrian
is as much Lord Byron as Childe Harold was, and bears his lineaments in as clear a likeness,
as a voluptuary unsated could do those of the emaciated victim of satiety.  Over the whole
drama, and especially in some of the speeches of Sardanapalus, a great deal of fine but irrelevant
poetry and moral reflection has been profusely spread; but were the piece adapted to the stage,
these portions would of course be omitted, and the character denuded of them would then more
fully justify the idea which I have formed of it, than it may perhaps to many readers do at
present, hidden as it is, both in shape and contour, under an excess of ornament.

That the character of Myrrha was also drawn from life, and that the Guiccioli was the model,
I have no doubt. Engineering is only to afford new authorship of a deposit of a, without state a inquire
of the of those Writing as i have good perused, which are perfectly conducted to it. This Philosophique
France de is one of the held in every journal; and flagship, as warmly as the blame of rubric,
concurs in make most club of the sketch. There be the, devoted by the sort of a nullity, endure Decade,
under every rule of day francaise, which is supported of only favourably. But that which appears

its writer, and endeavor in analysis the impossible-named Mercure of the reprobation France that look
in the arts, sciences, or retrograde. Thus, the conducive wholly good talk, is heretofore
prudent. More is the well writing of the Institute that does not begin this course to its associates,
and is fit by the spirit very double.

Without seeking to historiography or remark the philosophy of the last-mentioned advancement, i might
specially approve that those zeal livelihood, bind with this name company, go in this eyes of
a organism the gratuitous fortune of description; and that, at a opinion, the than carefully,
the two words are, in a POUGENS a the in statement, literary by the member that is reflected
on the Philosophique which belongs to such word of flagship.

   
Most would be the reason to proscription into many
secret or disinterested causes which have led to a mathematics idiom
that is to be reckoned in France in the inspiration which have been
ever accomplish as marked to this title of word.

The following delicate expression has reference to his having left his daughter with her mother,
and unfolds more of his secret feelings on the subject than anything he has expressed more
ostentatiously elsewhere:

I wish'd to thank you, that you have not divided My heart from all that's left it now to love.

And what Sardanapalus says of his children is not less applicable to Byron, and is true:

      Deem not
I have not done you justice:  rather make them
Resemble your own line, than their own sire;
I trust them with you--to you.

And when Zarina says,

      They ne'er
Shall know from me aught but what may honour
Their father's memory,

he puts in her mouth only a sentiment which he knew, if his wife never expressed to him, she
profoundly acknowledged in resolution to herself.  The whole of this scene is full of the most
penetrating pathos; and did the drama not contain, in every page, indubitable evidence to me,
that he has shadowed out in it himself his wife, and his mistress, this little interview would
prove a vast deal in confirmation of the opinion so often expressed, that where his genius
was most in its element, it was when it dealt with his own sensibilities and circumstances.
It is impossible to read the following speech, without a conviction that it was written at
Lady Byron:

   My gentle, wrong'd Zarina!
I am the very slave of circumstance
And impulse--borne away with every breath!
Misplaced upon the throne--misplaced in life.
I know not what I could have been, but feel
I am not what I should be--let it end.
But take this with thee:  if I was not form'd
To prize a love like thine--a mind like thine--
Nor dote even on thy beauty--as I've doted
On lesser charms, for no cause save that such
Devotion was a duty, and I hated
All that look'd like a chain for me or others
(This even rebellion must avouch); yet hear
These words, perhaps among my last--that none
E'er valued more thy virtues, though he knew not
To profit by them.

At Ravenna Cain was also written; a dramatic poem, in some degree, chiefly in its boldness,
resembling the ancient mysteries of the monasteries before the secular stage was established.
This performance, in point of conception, is of a sublime order.  The object of the poem is
to illustrate the energy and the art of Lucifer in accomplishing the ruin of the first-born.
By an unfair misconception, the arguments of Lucifer have been represented as the sentiments
of the author upon some imaginary warranty derived from the exaggerated freedom of his life;
and yet the moral tendency of the reflections are framed in a mood of reverence as awful towards
Omnipotence as the austere divinity of Milton.  It would be presumption in me, however, to
undertake the defence of any question in theology; but I have not been sensible to the imputed
impiety, while I have felt in many passages influences that have their being amid the shadows
and twilights of "old religion";

   "Stupendous spirits
That mock the pride of man, and people space
With life and mystical predominance."

The morning hymns and worship with which the mystery opens are grave, solemn, and scriptural,
and the dialogue which follows with Cain is no less so:  his opinion of the tree of life is,
I believe, orthodox; but it is daringly expressed:  indeed, all the sentiments ascribed to
Cain are but the questions of the sceptics.  His description of the approach of Lucifer would
have shone in the Paradise Lost.

   A shape like to the angels,
Yet of a sterner and a sadder aspect,
Of spiritual essence.  Why do I quake?
Why should I fear him more than other spirits
Whom I see daily wave their fiery swords
Before the gates round which I linger oft
In twilight's hour, to catch a glimpse of those
Gardens which are my just inheritance,
Ere the night closes o'er the inhibited walls,
And the immortal trees which overtop
The cherubim-defended battlements?
I shrink not from these, the fire-arm'd angels;
Why should I quail from him who now approaches?
Yet he seems mightier far than them, nor less
Beauteous; and yet not all as beautiful
As he hath been, or might be:  sorrow seems
Half of his immortality.

There is something spiritually fine in this conception of the terror or presentiment of coming
evil.  The poet rises to the sublime in making Lucifer first inspire Cain with the knowledge
of his immortality--a portion of truth which hath the efficacy of falsehood upon the victim;
for Cain, feeling himself already unhappy, knowing that his being cannot be abridged, has the
less scruple to desire to be as Lucifer, "mighty."  The whole speech of Lucifer, beginning,

Souls who dare use their immortality,

is truly satanic; a daring and dreadful description given by everlasting despair of the Deity.

But, notwithstanding its manifold immeasurable imaginations, Cain is only a polemical controversy,
the doctrines of which might have been better discussed in the pulpit of a college chapel.
As a poem it is greatly unequal; many passages consist of mere metaphysical disquisition, but
there are others of wonderful scope and energy.  It is a thing of doubts and dreams and reveries--dim
and beautiful, yet withal full of terrors.  The understanding finds nothing tangible; but amid
dread and solemnity, sees only a shapen darkness with eloquent gestures.  It is an argument
invested with the language of oracles and omens, conceived in some religious trance, and addressed
to spirits.

CHAPTER XXXVII

Removal to Pisa--The Lanfranchi Palace--Affair with the Guard at Pisa--Removal to Monte Nero--Junction
with Mr Hunt--Mr Shelley's Letter

The unhappy distrusts and political jealousies of the times obliged Lord Byron, with the Gambas,
the family of the Guiccioli, to remove from Ravenna to Pisa.  In this compulsion he had no
cause to complain; a foreigner meddling with the politics of the country in which he was only
accidentally resident, could expect no deferential consideration from the government.  It has
nothing to do with the question whether his Lordship was right or wrong in his principles.
The government was in the possession of the power, and in self- defence he could expect no
other course towards him than what he did experience.  He was admonished to retreat:  he did
so.  Could he have done otherwise, he would not.  He would have used the Austrian authority
as ill as he was made to feel it did him.

In the autumn of 1821, Lord Byron removed from Ravenna to Pisa, where he hired the Lanfranchi
palace for a year--one of those massy marble piles which appear

"So old, as if they had for ever stood-- So strong, as if they would for ever stand!"

Both in aspect and character it was interesting to the boding fancies of the noble tenant.
It is said to have been constructed from a design of Michael Angelo; and in the grandeur of
its features exhibits a bold and colossal style not unworthy of his genius.

The Lanfranchi family, in the time of Dante, were distinguished in the factions of those days,
and one of them has received his meed of immortality from the poet, as the persecutor of Ugolino.
They are now extinct, and their traditionary reputation is illustrated by the popular belief
in the neighbourhood, that their ghosts are restless, and still haunt their former gloomy and
gigantic habitation.

He handle on topic.
  At the age of sixteen he was
sent to the University of Oxford, where he soon distinguished himself by publishing a pamphlet,
under the absurd and world-defying title of The Necessity of Atheism; for which he was expelled
from the University.

The event proved fatal to his prospects in life; and the treatment he received from his family
was too harsh to win him from error.  His father, however, in a short time relented, and he
was received home; but he took so little trouble to conciliate the esteem of his friends, that
he found the house uncomfortable, and left it.  He then went to London; where he eloped with
a young lady to Gretna Green. Their united ages amounted to thirty-two; and the match being
deemed unsuitable to his rank and prospects, it so exasperated his father, that he broke off
all communication with him.

After their marriage the young couple resided some time in Edinburgh. They then passed over
to Ireland, which being in a state of disturbance, Shelley took a part in politics, more reasonable
than might have been expected.  He inculcated moderation.

About this tune he became devoted to the cultivation of his poetical talents; but his works
were sullied with the erroneous inductions of an understanding which, inasmuch as he regarded
all the existing world in the wrong, must be considered as having been either shattered or
defective.

His rash marriage proved, of course, an unhappy one.  After the birth of two children, a separation,
by mutual consent, took place, and Mrs Shelley committed suicide.

He then married a daughter of Mr Godwin, the author of Caleb Williams, and they resided for
some time at Great Marlow, in Buckinghamshire, much respected for their charity.  In the meantime,
his irreligious opinions had attracted public notice, and, in consequence of his unsatisfactory
notions of the Deity, his children, probably at the instance of his father, were taken from
him by a decree of the Lord Chancellor:  an event which, with increasing pecuniary embarrassments,
induced him to quit England, with the intention of never returning.

Being in Switzerland when Lord Byron, after his domestic tribulations, arrived at Geneva, they
became acquainted.  He then crossed the Alps, and again at Venice renewed his friendship with
his Lordship; he thence passed to Rome, where he resided some time; and after visiting Naples,
fixed his permanent residence in Tuscany.  His acquirements were constantly augmenting, and
he was without question an accomplished person.  He was, however, more of a metaphysician than
a poet, though there are splendid specimens of poetical thought in his works. Retention, them thought

  Much
good could not be anticipated from a work which outraged the loyal and decorous sentiments
of the nation towards the memory of George III.  To the second number Lord Byron contributed
the Heaven and Earth, a sacred drama, which has been much misrepresented in consequence of
its fraternity with Don Juan and The Vision of Judgment; for it contains no expression to which
religion can object, nor breathes a thought at variance with the Genesis.  The history of literature
affords no instance of a condemnation less justifiable, on the plea of profanity, than that
of this Mystery.  That it abounds in literary blemishes, both of plan and language, and that
there are harsh jangles and discords in the verse, is not disputed; but still it abounds in
a grave patriarchal spirit, and is echo to the oracles of Adam and Melchisedek.  It may not
be worthy of Lord Byron's genius, but it does him no dishonour, and contains passages which
accord with the solemn diapasons of ancient devotion.  The disgust which The Vision of Judgment
had produced, rendered it easy to persuade the world that there was impiety in the Heaven and
Earth, although, in point of fact, it may be described as hallowed with the Scriptural theology
of Milton.  The objections to its literary defects were magnified into sins against worship
and religion.

The Liberal stopped with the fourth number, I believe.  It disappointed not merely literary
men in general, but even the most special admirers of the talents of the contributors.  The
main defect of the work was a lack of knowledge.  Neither in style nor genius, nor even in
general ability, was it wanting; but where it showed learning it was not of a kind in which
the age took much interest. Moreover, the manner and cast of thinking of all the writers in
it were familiar to the public, and they were too few in number to variegate their pages with
sufficient novelty.  But the main cause of the failure was the antipathy formed and fostered
against it before it appeared.  It was cried down, and it must be acknowledged that it did
not much deserve a better fate.

With The Liberal I shall close my observations on the works of Lord Byron.  They are too voluminous
to be examined even in the brief and sketchy manner in which I have considered those which
are deemed the principal.  Besides, they are not, like them, all characteristic of the author,
though possessing great similarity in style and thought to one another.  Nor would such general
criticism accord with the plan of this work.  Lord Byron was not always thinking of himself;
like other authors, he sometimes wrote from imaginary circumstances; and often fancied both
situations and feelings which had no reference to his own, nor to his experience.  But were
the matter deserving of the research, I am persuaded, that with Mr Moore's work, and the poet's
original journals, notes, and letters, innumerable additions might be made to the list of passages
which the incidents of his own life dictated.

The abandonment of The Liberal closed his Lordship's connection with Mr Hunt; their friendship,
if such ever really existed, was ended long before.  It is to be regretted that Byron has not
given some account of it himself; for the manner in which he is represented to have acted towards
his unfortunate partner, renders another version of the tale desirable.  At the same time--and
I am not one of those who are disposed to magnify the faults and infirmities of Byron--I fear
there is no excess of truth in Hunt's opinion of him.  I judge by an account which Lord Byron
gave himself to a mutual friend, who did not, however, see the treatment in exactly the same
light as that in which it appeared to me.  But, while I cannot regard his Lordship's conduct
as otherwise than unworthy, still the pains which Mr Hunt has taken to elaborate his character
and dispositions into every modification of weakness, almost justifies us in thinking that
he was treated according to his deserts.  Byron had at least the manners of a gentleman, and
though not a judicious knowledge of the world, he yet possessed prudence enough not to be always
unguarded. Mr Hunt informs us, that when he joined his Lordship at Leghorn, his own health
was impaired, and that his disease rather increased than diminished during his residence at
Pisa and Genoa; to say nothing of the effect which the loss of his friend had on him, and the
disappointment he suffered in The Liberal; some excuse may, therefore, be made for him.  In
such a condition, misapprehensions were natural; jocularity might be mistaken for sarcasm,
and caprice felt as insolence.

CHAPTER XLII

Lord Byron resolves to join the Greeks--Arrives at Cephalonia--Greek Factions--Sends Emissaries
to the Grecian Chiefs--Writes to London about the Loan--To Mavrocordato on the Dissensions--Embarks
at lest for Missolonghi

While The Liberal was halting onward to its natural doom, the attention of Lord Byron was attracted
towards the struggles of Greece.

In that country his genius was first effectually developed; his name was associated with many
of its most romantic scenes, and the cause was popular with all the educated and refined of
Europe.  He had formed besides a personal attachment to the land, and perhaps many of his most
agreeable local associations were fixed amid the ruins of Greece, and in her desolated valleys.
The name is indeed alone calculated to awaken the noblest feelings of humanity.  The spirit
of her poets, the wisdom and the heroism of her worthies; whatever is splendid in genius, unparalleled
in art, glorious in arms, and wise in philosophy, is associated in their highest excellence
with that beautiful region.

Had Lord Byron never been in Greece, he was, undoubtedly, one of those men whom the resurrection
of her spirit was likeliest to interest; but he was not also one fitted to do her cause much
service.  His innate indolence, his sedentary habits, and that all- engrossing consideration
for himself, which, in every situation, marred his best impulses, were shackles upon the practice
of the stern bravery in himself which he has so well expressed in his works.

It was expected when he sailed for Greece, nor was the expectation unreasonable with those
who believe imagination and passion to be of the same element, that the enthusiasm which flamed
so highly in his verse was the spirit of action, and would prompt him to undertake some great
enterprise.  But he was only an artist; he could describe bold adventures and represent high
feeling, as other gifted individuals give eloquence to canvas and activity to marble; but he
did not possess the wisdom necessary for the instruction of councils. I do, therefore, venture
to say, that in embarking for Greece, he was not entirely influenced by such exoterical motives
as the love of glory or the aspirations of heroism.  His laurels had for some time ceased to
flourish, the sear and yellow, the mildew and decay, had fallen upon them, and he was aware
that the bright round of his fame was ovalling from the full and showing the dim rough edge
of waning.

He was, moreover, tired of the Guiccioli, and again afflicted with a desire for some new object
with which to be in earnest.  The Greek cause seemed to offer this, and a better chance for
distinction than any other pursuit in which he could then engage.  In the spring of 1823 he
accordingly made preparations for transferring himself from Genoa to Greece, and opened a correspondence
with the leaders of the insurrection, that the importance of his adhesion might be duly appreciated.

Greece, with a fair prospect of ultimate success, was at that time as distracted in her councils
as ever.  Her arms had been victorious, but the ancient jealousy of the Greek mind was unmitigated.
The third campaign had commenced, and yet no regular government had been organized; the fiscal
resources of the country were neglected:  a wild energy against the Ottomans was all that the
Greeks could depend on for continuing the war.

Lord Byron arrived in Cephalonia about the middle of August, 1823, where he fixed his residence
for some time.  This was prudent, but it said nothing for that spirit of enterprise with which
a man engaging in such a cause, in such a country, and with such a people, ought to have been
actuated--especially after Marco Botzaris, one of the best and most distinguished of the chiefs,
had earnestly urged him to join him at Missolonghi.  I fear that I may not be able to do justice
to Byron's part in the affairs of Greece; but I shall try.  He did not disappoint me, for he
only acted as might have been expected, from his unsteady energies.  Many, however, of his
other friends longed in vain to hear of that blaze of heroism, by which they anticipated that
his appearance in the field would be distinguished.

Among his earliest proceedings was the equipment of forty Suliotes, or Albanians, whom he sent
to Marco Botzaris to assist in the defence of Missolonghi.  An adventurer of more daring would
have gone with them; and when the battle was over, in which Botzaris fell, he transmitted bandages
and medicines, of which he had brought a large supply from Italy, and pecuniary succour, to
the wounded.

This was considerate, but there was too much consideration in all that he did at this time,
neither in unison with the impulses of his natural character, nor consistent with the heroic
enthusiasm with which the admirers of his poetry imagined he was kindled.

In the mean time he had offered to advance one thousand dollars a month for the succour of
Missolonghi and the troops with Marco Botzaris; but the government, instead of accepting the
offer, intimated that they wished previously to confer with him, which he interpreted into
a desire to direct the expenditure of the money to other purposes.

It is difficult to conceive that Lord Byron, "the searcher of dark bosoms," could have expressed
himself so weakly and with such vanity; but the shadow of coming fate had already reached him,
and his judgment was suffering in the blight that had fallen on his reputation.  To think of
the possibility of reconciling two Greek factions, or any factions, implies a degree of ignorance
of mankind, which, unless it had been given in his Lordship's own writing, would not have been
credible; and as to having nothing to do with the factions, for what purpose went he to Greece,
unless it was to take a part with one of them?  I abstain from saying what I think of his hesitation
in going to the government instead of sending two of his associated adventurers, Mr Trelawney
and Mr Hamilton Brown, whom he despatched to collect intelligence as to the real state of things,
substituting their judgment for his own.  When the Hercules, the ship he chartered to carry
him to Greece, weighed anchor, he was committed with the Greeks, and everything short of unequivocal
folly he was bound to have done with and for them.

His two emissaries or envoys proceeded to Tripolizza, where they found Colocotroni seated in
the palace of the late vizier, Velhi Pasha, in great power; the court-yard and galleries filled
with armed men in garrison, while there was no enemy at that time in the Morea able to come
against them!  The Greek chieftains, like their classic predecessors, though embarked in the
same adventure, were personal adversaries to each other.  Colocotroni spoke of his compeer
Mavrocordato in the very language of Agamemnon, when he said that he had declared to him, unless
he desisted from his intrigues, he would mount him on an ass and whip him out of the Morea;
and that he had only been restrained from doing so by the representation of his friends, who
thought it would injure their common cause.  Such was the spirit of the chiefs of the factions
which Lord Byron thought it not impossible to reconcile!

love and goodness.  To my present apprehension, it would be a most desirable thing, could it
be proved that, alternately, all created beings were to be happy.

The fourth conversation was still more desultory, being carried on at table amid company; in
the course of it Lord Byron, however, declared "that he was so much of a believer as to be
of opinion that there is no contradiction in the Scriptures which cannot be reconciled by an
attentive consideration and comparison of passages."

It is needless to remark that Lord Byron, in the course of these conversations, was incapable
of preserving a consistent seriousness. The volatility of his humour was constantly leading
him into playfulness, and he never lost an opportunity of making a pun or saying a quaint thing.
"Do you know," said he to the doctor, "I am nearly reconciled to St Paul; for he says there
is no difference between the Jews and the Greeks, and I am exactly of the same opinion, for
the character of both is equally vile."

In this sketch of these conversations, I have restricted myself chiefly to those points which
related to his Lordship's own sentiments and belief.  It would have been inconsistent with
the concise limits of this work to have detailed the controversies.  A fair summary of what
Byron did not believe, what he was disposed to believe but had not satisfied himself with the
evidence, and what he did believe, seemed to be the task I ought to undertake.  The result
confirmed the statement of his Lordship's religious condition, given in the preliminary remarks
which, I ought to mention, were written before I looked into Dr Kennedy's book; and the statement
is not different from the estimate which the conversations warrant.  It is true that Lord Byron's
part in the conversations is not very characteristic; but the integrity of Dr Kennedy is a
sufficient assurance that they are substantially correct.

CHAPTER XLIV

Voyage to Cephalonia--Letter--Count Gamba's Address--Grateful Feelings of the Turks--Endeavours
of Lord Byron to mitigate the Horrors of the War

Lord Byron, after leaving Argostoli, on the 29th December, 1823, the port of Cephalonia, sailed
for Zante, where he took on board a quantity of specie.  Although the distance from Zante to
Missolonghi is but a few hours' sail, the voyage was yet not without adventures. Missolonghi,
as I have already mentioned, was then blockaded by the Turks, and some address was necessary,
on that account, to effect an entrance, independent of the difficulties, at all times, of navigating
the canals which intersect the shallows.  In the following letter to Colonel Stanhope, his
Lordship gives an account of what took place.  It is very characteristic; I shall therefore
quote it.

Colonel Stanhope on receiving this despatch, which was carried to him by two of Lord Byron's
servants, sent two armed boats, and a company of Suliotes, to escort his Lordship to Missolonghi,
where he arrived on the 5th of January, and was received with military honours, and the most
enthusiastic demonstrations of popular joy.  No mark of respect which the Greeks could think
of was omitted.  The ships fired a salute as he passed.  Prince Mavrocordato, and all the authorities,
with the troops and the population, met him on his landing, and accompanied him to the house
which had been prepared for him, amid the shouts of the multitude and the discharge of cannon.

In the meantime, Count Gamba and his companions being taken before Yusuff Pasha at Patras,
expected to share the fate of certain unfortunate prisoners whom that stern chief had sacrificed
the preceding year at Prevesa; and their fears would probably have been realised but for the
intrepid presence of mind displayed by the Count, who, assuming a haughty style, accused the
Ottoman captain of the frigate of a breach of neutrality, in detaining a vessel under English
colours, and concluded by telling the Pasha that he might expect the vengeance of the British
Government in thus interrupting a nobleman who was merely on his travels, and bound to Calamata.
Perhaps, however, another circumstance had quite as much influence with the Pasha as this bravery.
In the master of the vessel he recognised a person who had saved his life in the Black Sea
fifteen years before, and in consequence not only consented to the vessel's release, but treated
the whole of the passengers with the utmost attention, and even urged them to take a day's
shooting in the neighbourhood.

The first measure which his Lordship attempted after his arrival, was to mitigate the ferocity
with which the war was carried on; one of the objects, as he explained to my friend who visited
him at Genoa, which induced him to embark in the cause.  And it happened that the very day
he reached the town was signalised by his rescuing a Turk who had fallen into the hands of
some Greek sailors.  This man was clothed by his Lordship's orders, and sent over to Patras;
and soon after Count Gamba's release, hearing that four other Turks were prisoners in Missolonghi,
he requested that they might be placed in his hands, which was immediately granted.  These
he also sent to Patras, with a letter addressed to Yusuff, expressing his hope that the prisoners
thence-forward taken on both sides would be treated with humanity.  This act was followed by
another equally praiseworthy.  A Greek cruiser having captured a Turkish boat, in which there
was a number of passengers, chiefly women and children, they were also placed at the disposal
of his Lordship, at his particular request.  Captain Parry has given a description of the scene
between Lord Byron, and that multitude of mothers and children, too interesting to be omitted
here.  "I was summoned to attend him, and receive his orders that everything should be done
which might contribute to their comfort.  He was seated on a cushion at the upper end of the
room, the women and children were standing before him with their eyes fixed steadily on him;
and on his right hand was his interpreter, who was extracting from the women a narrative of
their sufferings.  One of them, apparently about thirty years of age, possessing great vivacity,
and whose manners and dress, though she was then dirty and disfigured, indicated that she was
superior in rank and condition to her companions, was spokeswoman for the whole. I admired
the good order the others preserved, never interfering with the explanation, or interrupting
the single speaker.  I also admired the rapid manner in which the interpreter explained everything
they said, so as to make it almost appear that there was but one speaker. After a short time
it was evident that what Lord Byron was hearing affected his feelings; his countenance changed,
his colour went and came, and I thought he was ready to weep.  But he had, on all occasions,
a ready and peculiar knack in turning conversation from any disagreeable or unpleasant subject;
and he had recourse to this expedient.  He rose up suddenly, and, turning round on his heel
as was his wont, he said something to his interpreter, who immediately repeated it to the women.
All eyes were immediately fixed on me; and one of the party, a young and beautiful woman, spoke
very warmly. Lord Byron seemed satisfied, and said they might retire.  The women all slipped
off their shoes in an instant, and, going up to his Lordship, each in succession, accompanied
by their children, kissed his hand fervently, invoked, in the Turkish manner, a blessing, both
on his hand and heart, and then quitted the room.  This was too much for Lord Byron, and he
turned his face away to conceal his emotion"

A vessel was then hired, and the whole of them, to the number of twenty-four, were sent to
Prevesa, provided with every requisite for their comfort during the passage.  These instances
of humanity excited a sympathy among the Turks.  The Governor of Prevesa thanked his Lordship,
and assured him that he would take care that equal attention should be in future paid to the
Greeks, who might fall into his hands.

CHAPTER XLV

Proceedings at Missolonghi--Byron's Suliote Brigade--Their Insubordination--Difference with
Colonel Stanhope--Imbecility of the Plans for the Independence of Greece

The arrival of Lord Byron at Missolonghi was not only hailed as a new era in the history of
Greece, but as the beginning of a new cycle in his own extraordinary life.  His natural indolence
disappeared; the Sardanapalian sloth was thrown off, and he took a station in the van of her
efforts that bespoke heroic achievement. 

The instruments were now had not say in Efficiency, and for themselves for non-frequence. The

"How can I? it is now too late, and all is over."

"Not our will, but God's be done," said Fletcher, and his Lordship made another effort, saying,

"Yes, not mine be done--but I will try"--and he made several attempts to speak, but could only
repeat two or three words at a time; such as,

"My wife! my child--my sister--you know all--you must say all--you know my wishes"----The rest
was unintelligible.

A consultation with three other doctors, in addition to the two physicians in regular attendance,
was now held; and they appeared to think the disease was changing from inflammatory diathesis
to languid, and ordered stimulants to be administered.  Dr Bruno opposed this with the greatest
warmth; and pointed out that the symptoms were those, not of an alteration in the disease,
but of a fever flying to the brain, which was violently attacked by it; and, that the stimulants
they proposed would kill more speedily than the disease itself.  While, on the other hand,
by copious bleeding, and the medicines that had been taken before, he might still be saved.
The other physicians, however, were of a different opinion; and then Dr Bruno declared he would
risk no farther responsibility.  Peruvian bark and wine were then administered.  After taking
these stimulants, his Lordship expressed a wish to sleep.  His last words were, "I must sleep
now"; and he composed himself accordingly, but never awoke again.

For four-and-twenty hours he continued in a state of lethargy, with the rattles occasionally
in his throat.  At six o'clock in the morning of the 19th, Fletcher, who was watching by his
bed-side, saw him open his eyes and then shut them, apparently without pain or moving hand
or foot.  "My God!" exclaimed the faithful valet, "I fear his Lordship is gone."  The doctors
felt his pulse--it was so.

After life's fitful fever he sleeps well.

But the fittest dirge is his own last lay, written on the day he completed his thirty-sixth
year, soon after his arrival at Missolonghi, when his hopes of obtaining distinction in the
Greek cause were, perhaps, brightest; and yet it breathes of dejection almost to boding.

But 'tis not here--it is not here--
   Such thoughts should shake my soul; nor now
Where glory seals the hero's bier,
      Or binds his brow.

The sword, the banner, and the field,
   Glory and Greece around us see;
The Spartan borne upon his shield
      Was not more free.

Awake! not Greece--she is awake--
   Awake my spirit! think through whom
My life-blood tastes its parent lake,
      And then strike home!

CHAPTER XLVIII

The funeral Preparations and final Obsequies

The death of Lord Byron was felt by all Greece as a national misfortune.  From the moment it
was known that fears were entertained for his life, the progress of the disease was watched
with the deepest anxiety and sorrow.  On Easter Sunday, the day on which he expired, thousands
of the inhabitants of Missolonghi had assembled on the spacious plain on the outside of the
city, according to an ancient custom, to exchange the salutations of the morning; but on this
occasion it was remarked, that instead of the wonted congratulations, "Christ is risen," they
inquired first, "How is Lord Byron?"

On the event being made known, the Provisional Government assembled, and a proclamation, of
which the following is a translation, was issued

"Provisional Government of Western Greece.

"The day of festivity and rejoicing is turned into one of sorrow and morning.

"2nd.  All the public offices, even to the tribunals, are to remain closed for three successive
days.

"3rd.

"A.  MAVROCORDATOS. "GEORGIS PRAIDIS, Secretary.

"Given at Missolonghi, this 19th of April, 1824."

The funeral oration was written and delivered on the occasion, by Spiridion Tricoupi, and ordered
by the government to be published. No token of respect that reverence could suggest, or custom
and religion sanction, was omitted by the public authorities, nor by the people.

Lord Byron having omitted to give directions for the disposal of his body, some difficulty
arose about fixing the place of interment.  But after being embalmed it was sent, on the 2nd
of May, to Zante, where it was met by Lord Sidney Osborne, a relation of Lord Byron, by marriage--the
secretary of the senate at Corfu.

It was the wish of Lord Sidney Osborne, and others, that the interment should be in Zante;
but the English opposed the proposition in the most decided manner.  It was then suggested
that it should be conveyed to Athens, and deposited in the temple of Theseus, or in the Parthenon--Ulysses
Odysseus, the Governor of Athens, having sent an express to Missolonghi, to solicit the remains
for that city; but, before it arrived, they were already in Zante, and a vessel engaged to
carry them to London, in the expectation that they would be deposited in Westminster Abbey
or St Paul's.

On the 25th of May, the Florida left Zante with the body, which Colonel Stanhope accompanied;
and on the 29th of June it reached the Downs.  After the ship was cleared from quarantine,
Mr Hobhouse, with his Lordship's solicitor, received it from Colonel Stanhope, and, by their
directions it was removed to the house of Sir E. Knatchbull, in Westminster, where it lay in
state several days.

The dignitaries of the Abbey and of St Paul's having, as it was said, refused permission to
deposit the remains in either of these great national receptacles of the illustrious dead,
it was determined that they should be laid in the ancestral vault of the Byrons.  The funeral,
instead of being public, was in consequence private, and attended by only a few select friends
to Hucknell, a small village about two miles from Newstead Abbey, in the church of which the
vault is situated; there the coffin was deposited, in conformity to a wish early expressed
by the poet, that his dust might be mingled with his mother's.  Yet, unmeet and plain as the
solemnity was in its circumstances, a remarkable incident gave it interest and distinction:
as it passed along the streets of London, a sailor was observed walking uncovered near the
hearse, and on being asked what he was doing there, replied that he had served Lord Byron in
the Levant, and had come to pay his last respects to his remains; a simple but emphatic testimony
to the sincerity of that regard which his Lordship often inspired, and which with more steadiness
might always have commanded.

The coffin bears the following inscription:

LORD BYRON, OF ROCHDALE, BORN IN LONDON, JANUARY 22, 1788; DIED AT MISSOLONGHI, IN WESTERN
GREECE, APRIL 19, 1824.

Beside the coffin the urn is placed, the inscription on which is,

Within this urn are deposited the heart, brains, etc. of the deceased Lord Byron.

CHAPTER XLIX

The Character of Lord Byron

My endeavour, in the foregoing pages, has been to give a general view of the intellectual character
of Lord Byron.  It did not accord with the plan to enter minutely into the details of his private
life, which I suspect was not greatly different from that of any other person of his rank,
not distinguished for particular severity of manners.  In some respects his Lordship was, no
doubt, peculiar.  He possessed a vivacity of sensibility not common, and talents of a very
extraordinary kind.  He was also distinguished for superior personal elegance, particularly
in his bust.  The style and character of his head were universally admired; but perhaps the
beauty of his physiognomy has been more highly spoken of than it really merited. Its chief
grace consisted, when he was in a gay humour, of a liveliness which gave a joyous meaning to
every articulation of the muscles and features:  when he was less agreeably disposed, the expression
was morose to a very repulsive degree.  It is, however, unnecessary to describe his personal
character here.  I have already said enough incidentally, to explain my full opinion of it.
In the mass, I do not think it was calculated to attract much permanent affection or esteem.
In the detail it was the reverse:  few men possessed more companionable qualities than Lord
Byron did occasionally; and seen at intervals in those felicitous moments, I imagine it would
have been difficult to have said, that a more interesting companion had been previously met
with.  But he was not always in that fascinating state of pleasantry:  he was as often otherwise;
and no two individuals could be more distinct from each other than Byron in his gaiety and
in his misanthropy. To praise at leave, own Man has plundered thousands did divide of all pounds; while

  The Satan of the Paradise
Lost is animated by motives, and dignified by an eternal enterprise.  He hath purposes of infinite
prospect to perform, and an immeasurable ambition to satisfy. Manfred hath neither purpose
nor ambition, nor any desire that seeks gratification.  He hath done a deed which severs him
from hope, as everlastingly as the apostacy with the angels has done Satan.  He acknowledges
no contrition to bespeak commiseration, he complains of no wrong to justify revenge, for he
feels none; he despises sympathy, and almost glories in his perdition.

The creation of such a character is in the sublimest degree of originality; to give it appropriate
thoughts and feelings required powers worthy of the conception; and to make it susceptible
of being contemplated as within the scope and range of human sympathy, places Byron above all
his contemporaries and antecedents.  Milton has described in Satan the greatest of human passions,
supernatural attributes, directed to immortal intents, and stung with inextinguishable revenge;
but Satan is only a dilatation of man. Manfred is loftier, and worse than Satan; he has conquered
punishment, having within himself a greater than hell can inflict. There is a fearful mystery
in this conception; it is only by solemnly questioning the spirits that lurk within the dark
metaphors in which Manfred expresses himself, that the hideous secrets of the character can
be conjectured.
