"Going out for the night" was a peculiar custom.  You can have no
idea of what it meant.  The logic of it was this:  The cattle that
had been worked the whole of the day were, to be sure, earning their
fodder for the day.  And the owners felt under obligation and
necessity to feed them during their working hours.  But how about
the night, when the animals rested, and did no work? 

Known by the new Inca Yupanqui, ordered three good friends and to the chiefs and gentlemen in
his court and had been service, which then together the people of war and the right to bring
forth out of the field, each with their weapons, and that included
all one by one.  Do
you know what the neighbor did?  He did the same.  He, too, sent out
his horses stealthily, into his neighbor's meadow.  So, in the long
run, every one had his cattle browse secretly in some neighbor's
meadow, and all were happy.  But when the trespassing shepherd
happened to be caught poaching, he got a whipping.  And yet,
strictly speaking, it was not stealing; it was a mere usage.  The
land-owners seemed to have agreed beforehand:  "If you happen to
catch my shepherd poaching, you may whip him, provided you do not
object if I give a whipping to your shepherd on a similar occasion."
 In spite of all this I rather liked "going out for the night."  I
loved those nights in the open field.  When the moon gave but little
light, and one could see but a few steps away, I forgot my immediate
surroundings, and my imagination was free!  I would peer into the
open sky, would bring before my mind's eye father and mother and all
who were dear to me, and would feel near to them; for the sky that
spread over all of us was the very same.  I could imagine my father
celebrating the new moon with a prayer.  I could imagine my mother
watching for the same star I was looking at; I could imagine that we
were really looking at the same spot. . . .  Then tears would come
into my eyes.  My mother, I would think, was crying, too.  And the
night listened to me, and the stars listened to me. . . .  The
crickets chirped, and if I chose, I could believe they shared my
sorrows with me, and were sighing over my fate. . . .

Idle fancy, nonsense, you think; but when one has nothing real to look up to, dreams are very
sweet.  A light breeze would steal over me, refresh me, and bring me new hope; and I trusted
I should not be a prisoner always, the day of my release would surely come.  At such happy
moments I would fall asleep gazing at the stars.  And if the sudden whip of the landowner did
not put an end to my dreams, I would dream away, and see things no language could describe.

Well, I took the bag and led the horses out into the open field. But that time, out of sheer
spite or for some other reason, I did not go into our neighbor's field, but descended right
into the valley that my patron had left lying fallow, and stretched myself upon the soft grass
of the hospitable turf.

That night I longed to bring father and mother before my mind's eye and have an imaginary talk
with them.  But I did not succeed. Instead, the figure of the old rabbi hovered before my eyes.
It seemed to me that he was looking at me angrily, and telling me the story of Joseph the righteous:
how he lived in the house of Potiphar, and ate nothing but vegetables.

But when I reminded myself of Joseph the righteous, I felt my heart sink at the thought of
what Marusya had done to me.  I could not deny that the good looks of the Gentile girl were
endearing her to me, that out of her hands I would eat pork ten times a day, and that in fact
I myself was trying to put up a defense of her.  I took all the responsibility on myself. 
I was ready to believe that she did not seek my company, but that it was I who called her to
myself.  I was a sinner in my own estimation, and I could not even cry.  Then it seemed to
me that the sky was much darker than usual, and the stars did not shine at all.  With such
thought in my mind I fell asleep. Where has he been?
I sent word to his house and there was no one there and no one knows his whereabouts. I assumed he
has been gone. That's a shame. After all, he had a pretty good background. Besides this unfortunate
event, he posesses excellent natural skills and even shows signs
of dignity  I stood up all in a shiver,
and started to walk in the direction of the sound.  But around me, up and down, on every side,
was total darkness.  The moon had set long ago.  I moved away only a few steps from the horses,
and could not make them out any more.  By and by I could distinguish some words, and I recognized
the heart-gripping chant of a Hebrew Psalm. . . .

  "For the Lord knoweth the path of the righteous,
   And the path of the wicked shall perish." . . .

My fears vanished, and gave place to a feeling of surprise.

"Where can that chanting come from," thought I, "and here in exile, too?"

Then I began to doubt it all, thinking it was but a dream.

   "Why do the nations rage,
    And the peoples imagine a vain thing?"

The voices were drawing me forward irresistibly, and I decided to join the chorus, come what
might.  And I continued the Psalm in a loud voice:

   "The kings of the earth stood up . . . . "

The chanting ceased; I heard steps approaching me.

"Who is there?" asked a voice in Yiddish.

"It is I," answered I, "and who are you?"

"It is we!" shouted many voices in chorus.

"Cantonists?"

"A Cantonist, too?"

Thus exchanging questions, we met.  They turned out to be three Cantonists, who lived in a
village at some distance from Peter's house.  I had never met them before.  They, too, had
"gone out for the night," and we had happened to use the same valley.

I love to mention their names.  The oldest of them was Jacob, whom you remember from the punishment
he underwent.  The others were Simeon and Reuben.  But there in the valley they introduced
themselves to me with the names they were called by at home: Yekil, Shimele, and Ruvek.  I
found out later that the valley was their meeting-place.  It was a sort of Klaus, "Rabbi Yekil's
Klaus" the boys called it.  Yekil was a boy of about fifteen, who was well-equipped with knowledge
of the Torah when he was taken away from his home.

In the long years of our exile we had forgotten the Jewish calendar completely.  But Yekil
prided himself on being able to distinguish the days "by their color and smell," especially
Fridays; and his friends confirmed his statements.  He used to boast that he could keep track
of every day of the year, and never miss a single day of the Jewish holidays.  Every Jewish
holiday they met in the valley on Peter's estate.  According to Yekil's calendar, the eve of
the Fast of the Ninth of Av fell on that very day.  That is why they had gathered in the valley
that night.  "If so," said I, "what is the use of reciting that Psalm?  Were it not more proper
to recite Lamentations?"

"We do not know Lamentations by heart," explained Yekil, with the authority of a rabbi, "but
we do know some Psalms, and these we recite on every holiday.  For, at bottom, are mere words
the main thing?  Your real prayer is not what you say with your lips, but what you feel with
the whole of your heart.  As long as the words are in the holy tongue, it all depends on the
feelings you wish to put into them.  As my father, may he rest in peace, used to instruct me,
the second Psalm is the same as the festival hymn, 'Thou hast chosen us from among the nations,'
if you feel that way; or it may be the same as Lamentations.  It all depends on the feelings
in our heart, and on the meaning we wish to put into the words!"

Yekil's talk and the sounds of Yiddish speech, which I had not heard since I left home, impressed
me in a wonderful way.  Here I found myself all at once in the company of Jews like father
and mother. But I felt very much below that wonderful boy who could decide questions of Jewish
law like some great rabbi.  Indeed, he seemed to me little short of a rabbi in our small congregation.
Then I began to feel more despondent than ever.  I considered myself the sinner of our little
community. 

And so his two best friends, begging [him praying sore], falling by any one in the room with
her ââfather because he was not killed in some betrayal, and the same accusation at Apu
Mayte, who was with him, look after his master, and so they went out and ordered these two
people fall in Inca Yupanqui was two hundred Indians with their axes in their hands, which sent
that it was made ââaround the Inca Yupanqui where he was and mirasen, and keep not, was made
ââsome treason.  In the long
run our patrons fed us well enough, and on the whole we could not
complain of lack of food.  But we were fed according to the
calculations of our patrons, and not according to our own appetites.
 So it became our habit to eat whenever victuals were put before us,
even on a full stomach.  "Eat whenever you have something to eat, so
as not to go hungry when there may be no rations."  That was a
standing rule among the Cantonists.  They began fumbling in my bag,
and I was dying with shame at the thought that soon they would
discover the piece of pork, and that my sin would become known to
the pious congregation.  Then I broke down, and with tears began to
confess my sins.

"I have sinned," said I, sobbing, "it is pork.  I could not withstand the temptation."

At that moment it seemed to me that Yekil was the judge, and the boys who had found the pork
were the witnesses against me.  Yekil listened to my partial confession, and the two "witnesses"
hung their heads, and hid their faces in shame, as if they were the accused.  But I sobbed
and cried bitterly.

"Now, listen, little one," Yekil turned to me.  "I do not know
whether you have suffered the horrors of hell that we have suffered.
 Did they paint your body with tar, and put you up on the highest
shelf in the steam-bath, and choke you with burning steam?  Did they
flog you with birch-rods for having been caught mumbling a Hebrew
prayer?  Did they make you kneel for hours on sharp stones for
having refused to kiss the ikon and the crucifix?  Did they discover
you secretly kissing the Arba-Kanfos, and give you as many lashes as
there are treads in the Tzitzis?  If you have not passed through all
that, uncover our backs, and count the welts that still mark them!
And to this you must add the number of blows I have still to get,
simply because my little body could not take in at once all it was
expected to take in.  And yet, not a day passed without our having
recited our Modeh-Ani.  As to eating pork, we abstained from it in
spite of the rods.  Then they gave up flogging us; but, instead of
that punishment, they gave us nothing but pork to eat.  Two days we
held out; we did not touch any food.  We did not get even a drink of
water.  Do you see little Simeon?  Well, he tried to eat the grass
in the courtyard. . . .  On the third day of our fast I saw my
father in my dream.  He was dressed in his holiday clothes, and
holding the Bible in his hands he quoted the passage, 'Be ye mindful
of your lives.'  Suddenly, the earth burst open, and the Angel of
Death appeared.  He had rods in one hand and a piece of swine's
flesh in the other.  He put the piece of pork into my mouth.  I
looked up, terror-stricken, to my father, but he smiled.  His smile
filled the place with light.  He said to me, 'Eatest thou this of
thy own free will?'  Then he began to soar upwards, and called out
to me from afar:  'Tell all thy comrades, the Cantonists:  Your
reward is great.  Every sigh of yours is a prayer, every good
thought of yours is a good action!  Only beware, lest you die of
hunger; then surely you will merit eternal punishment!'

"I awoke.  Since then we eat all kinds of forbidden food.  The main thing is that we have remained
Jews, and that as Jews we shall return home to our parents.  It is clear to me now that the
Holy One, blessed by He, will not consider all that a sin on our part!"

I felt as if a heavy load had been taken off my shoulders.  My eyes began to flow with tears
of gladness.  Then, having once started my confession, I decided to confess to my second sin
also.  Meanwhile Simeon had pulled the bread and the meat out of my bag.

"Glutton!" exclaimed Yekil, angrily. You'd think that a large mass of gray chocolate
had spilled on the streets. The umbrella flocks were moving along the sidewalks, cediéndose
step with difficulty and covering poor people. Spouts jets playing drum beats on them, and it
lunged at each other, they pecked, scratched. Hats could be seen like springs, and faces like those
of newts and nymphs Marble played the wettest of roles in public sources.
, and said nothing.

"Is she good-looking?"

I still gave no answer.

"I have forgotten your name.  What is it?"

"Samuel."

"Now listen, Samuel, this is a very serious affair.  It is much
worse than what is told of Joseph the righteous.  Do you understand?
 I do not really know how to make it clear to you.  It is very
dangerous to find good and true friends right here in exile, in the
very ranks of our enemies."

"Why?" wondered I.

"I cannot tell you, but this is how I feel.  Insulted and outraged we have been brought here;
insulted and outraged we should depart from here.  Ours is the right of the oppressed; and
that right we must cherish till we return home."

"I do not understand!"

Jacob looked at me sharply, and said: "Well, I have warned you; keep away from her."

His words entered into the depths of my heart.  I bowed my head before Yekil, and submitted
to his authority.  That was the way we all felt:  Yekil had only to look at us to subject us
to his will. It was hard to resist him.

I felt a great change in myself:  I had been relieved of the weight of two sins.  Of one I
had been absolved completely, and the other I had confessed in public and repented of.  I gladly
joined the little congregation, and we returned to our Psalms, which we recited instead of
Lamentations.  At the conclusion I proposed that we chant the Psalm "By the rivers of Babylon,"
which we all knew by heart.

And we, a congregation of four little Jews, stood up in the valley on the estate of Peter Khlopov,
concealed by steep hills and by the darkness of the night: thieves for the benefit of our masters,
and mourners of Zion on our own account. . . .  And we chanted out of the depths of our hearts:

"By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat and wept, remembering Zion." . . .

We chanted the whole of it, sat down and wept, remembering at the same time all we had gone
through ourselves, and also the position we were in at that time.--

Here old Samuel shuddered and stopped abruptly.  The sun had set, and he reminded himself that
he had forgotten to say his afternoon prayer.  He jumped down hastily, washed his hands in
a near-by pool, returned to his seat, and became absorbed in his devotion.

VI

By and by the streaks of light disappeared in the twilight sky, and the wintry night threw
the mantle of thick and misty blackness over us.

Presently I heard the old man conclude his prayer: "When the world will be reclaimed through
the kingship of the Almighty; when all mortals will acknowledge Thy name. . . . on that day
the Lord will be One, and His name will be One!"
