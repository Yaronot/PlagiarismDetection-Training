    The following sentence, found in Chapter IX., was originally printed
     with the "three several" error and has not been changed:

        That evening Quisanté brought home to dinner the gentleman whom
        Dick Benyon called old Foster the maltster, and who had been
        Mayor of Henstead three several times.

                              QUISANTÉ.

                              CHAPTER I.

                       DICK BENYON'S OUTSIDER.

A shrunken sallow old lady, dressed in rusty ill-shaped black and adorned with an evidently
false 'front' of fair hair, sat in a tiny flat whose windows overlooked Hyde Park from south
to north. She was listening to a tall loose-built dark young man who walked restlessly about
the little room as he jerked out his thoughts and challenged the expression of hers. She had
known him since he was a baby, had brought him up from childhood, had always served him, always
believed in him, never liked him, never offered her love nor conciliated his. His father even,
her only brother Raphael Quisanté, she had not loved; but she had respected Raphael. Alexander--Sandro,
as she alone of all the world called him--she neither loved nor respected; him she only admired
and believed in. He knew his aunt's feelings well enough; she was his ally, not his friend;
kinship bound them, not affection; for his brain's sake and their common blood she was his
servant, his heart she left alone.

Thus aware of the truth, he felt no obligation towards her, not even when, as now, he came
to ask money of her; what else should she do with her money, where else lay either her duty
or her inclination? She did not love him, but he was her one interest, the only tie that united
her with the living moving world and the alluring future years, more precious to her since
she could see so few of them.

"I don't mean to make myself uncomfortable," said Miss Quisanté. "How much do you want?" He
stopped and turned round quickly with a gleam of eagerness in his eyes, as though he had a
vision of much wealth. "No, no," she added with a surly chuckle, "the least you'll take is
the most I'll give."

"I owe money."

"Who to?" she asked, setting her cap uncompromisingly straight. "Jews?"

"No. Dick Benyon."

"That money you'll never pay. I shan't consider that."

The young man's eyes rested on her in a long sombre glance; he seemed annoyed but not indignant,
like a lawyer whose formal plea is brushed aside somewhat contemptuously by an impatient truth-loving
judge.

"You've got five hundred a year or thereabouts," she went on, "and no wife."

He threw himself into a chair; his face broke into a sudden smile, curiously attractive, although
neither sweet nor markedly sincere. "Exactly," he said. "No wife. Well, shall I get one with
five hundred a year?" He laughed a little. "An election any fine day would leave me penniless,"
he added.

"There's Dick Benyon," observed the old lady.

"They talk about that too much already," said Quisanté.

"Come, Sandro, you're not sensitive."

"And Lady Richard hates me. Besides if you want to impress fools, you must respect their prejudices.
Give me a thousand a year; for the present, you know."

He asked nearly half the old lady's income; she sighed in relief. "Very well, a thousand a
year," she said. "Make a good show with it. Live handsomely. It'll pay you to live handsomely."

A genuine unmistakable surprise showed itself on his face; now there was even the indignation
which a reference to non-payment of debts had failed to elicit.

"I shall do something with it, you might know that," he said resentfully.

"Something honest, I mean."

"What?"

"Well, something not criminal," she amended, chuckling again. "I'm sorry to seem to know you
so well," she added.

"Oh, we know one another pretty well," said he with a nod. "Never the jam without the powder
from you."

"But always the jam," said old Maria. "And you'll find the world a good deal like your aunt,
Sandro."

An odd half-cunning half-eager gleam shot across his eyes.

"A man finds the world what he makes it," he said. He rose, came and stood over her, and went
on, laughing. "But the devil makes an aunt once and for all, and won't let one touch his handiwork."

"You can touch her savings, though!"

He blazed out into a sudden defiance. "Oh, refuse if you like. I can manage without you. You're
not essential to me."

She smiled, her thin lips setting in a wry curve. Now and then it seemed hard that there could
be no affection between her and the one being whom the course of events plainly suggested for
her love. But, as Sandro said, they knew one another very well. In the result she felt entitled
to assume no airs of superiority; he had not been a dutiful or a grateful nephew, she had not
been a devoted or a patient aunt; as she looked back, she was obliged to remember one or two
occasions when he had driven or betrayed her into a severity of which she did not willingly
think. This reflection dictated the words with which she met his outburst.

"You can tell your story on Judgment Day and I'll tell mine," she said. "Oh, neither of 'em
will lose in the telling, I'll be bound. Meanwhile let's be----"

"Friends?" he suggested with an obvious but not ill-natured sneer.

"Lord, no! Whatever you like! Banker and client, debtor and creditor, actor and audience? Take
your choice--and send me your bank's address."

He nodded slightly, as though he concluded a bargain, not at all as though he acknowledged
a favour. Yet he remarked in a ruminative tone, "I shall be very glad of the money."

A moment's pause followed. Then Miss Quisanté observed reluctantly,

"The only thing I ever care to know about you is what you're planning, Sandro. Don't I earn
that by my thousand a year?"

"Well, here you are. I'm started, thanks to Dick Benyon and myself. I've got my seat, I can
go on now. But I'm an outsider still." He paused a moment. "I feel that; Benyon feels it too.
I want to obviate it a bit. I mean to marry."

"An insider?" asked the old lady. She looked at him steadily. "Your taste's too bad," she said;
he was certainly dressed in a rather bizarre way. "And your manners," she added. "She won't
have you," she ended. Quisanté took no notice and seemed not to hear; he stood quite still
by the window, staring over the park. "Besides she'll know what you want her for."

He wheeled round suddenly and looked down at his aunt. His face was softer, the cunningness
had gone from his smile, his eyes seemed larger, clearer, even (by a queer delusion of sight)
better set and wider apart.

"Yes, I'll show her that," he said in a low voice, with a new richness of tone.

Old Maria looked up at him with an air of surprise.

"You do want her for that? As a help, I mean?" she asked.

His lips just moved to answer "Yes." Aunt Maria's eyes did not leave his face. She remembered
that when he had come before to talk about contesting the seat in Parliament he had now won,
there had been a moment (poised between long periods of calculation and elaborate forecasts
of personal advantage) in which his face had taken on the same soft light, the same inspiration.

"You odd creature!" she murmured gently. "She's handsome, I suppose?"

"Superb--better than that."

"A swell?" asked old Maria scornfully.

"Yes," he nodded.

His aunt laughed. "A Queen among women?" was the form her last question took.

"An Empress," said Alexander Quisanté, the more ornate title bursting gorgeously from his lips.

"Just the woman for you then!" remarked Aunt Maria. A stranger would have heard nothing in
her tone save mockery. Quisanté heard more, or did not hear that at all. He nodded again quite
gravely, and turned back to the window. There were two reasonable views of the matter; either
the lady was not what Quisanté declared her, or if she were she would have nothing to do with
Quisanté. But Aunt Maria reserved her opinion; she was prepared to find neither of these alternatives
correct.

For there was something remarkable about Sandro; the knowledge that had been hers so long promised
fair to become the world's discovery. Society was travelling towards Aunt Maria's opinion,
moved thereto not so much by a signally successful election fight, nor even by a knack of distracting
attention from others and fixing it on himself, as by the monstrous hold the young man had
obtained and contrived to keep over Dick Benyon. Dick was not a fool; here ended his likeness
to Quisanté; here surely ought to end his sympathy with that aspiring person? But there was
much more between them; society could see that for itself, while doubters found no difficulty
in overhearing Lady Richard's open lamentations. "If Dick had known him at school or at Cambridge----"
"If he was somebody very distinguished----" "If he was even a gentleman----" Eloquent beginnings
of unfinished sentences flowed with expressive freedom from Amy Benyon's pretty lips. "I don't
want to think my husband mad," she observed pathetically to Weston Marchmont, himself one of
the brightest hopes of that party which Dick Benyon was understood to consider in need of a
future leader. Was that leader to be Quisanté? Manners, not genius, Amy declared to be the
first essential. "And I don't believe he's got genius," she added hopefully; that he had no
manners did not need demonstration to Marchmont, whose own were so exquisite as to form a ready-make
standard.

And it was not only Dick. Jimmy was as bad. Nobody valued Jimmy's intellect, but every one
had been prepared to repose securely on the bedrock of his prejudices. He was as infatuated
as his brother; Quisanté had swept away the prejudices. The brethren were united in an effort
to foist their man into every circle and every position where he seemed to be least wanted;
to this end they devoted time, their social reputation, enthusiasm, and, as old Maria knew,
hard money. They were triple-armed in confidence. Jimmy met remonstrances with a quiet shrug;
Dick had one answer, always the same, given in the same way--a confident assertion, limited
and followed, an instant later, by one obvious condition, seemingly not necessary to express.
"You'll see, if he lives," he replied invariably when people asked him what there was after
all in Mr. Quisanté. Their friends could only wonder, asking plaintively what the Duke thought
of his brothers' proceedings. The Duke, however, made no sign; making no sign ranked as a characteristic
of the Duke's.

When Lady Richard discussed this situation with her friends the Gaston girls, she gained hearty
sympathy from Fanny, but from May no more than a mocking half-sincere curiosity.

"Is it possible for a man to like both me and Mr. Quisanté?" Lady Richard asked. "And after
all Dick does like me very much."

"Likes both his wife and Mr. Quisanté! What a man for paradoxes!" May murmured.

"Jimmy's worse if anything," the aggrieved wife went on. This remark was levelled straight
at Fanny; Jimmy being understood to like Fanny, a parallel problem presented itself. Fanny
recognized it but, not choosing to acknowledge Jimmy's devotion, met it by referring to Marchmont's
openly professed inability to tolerate Quisanté.

"I always go by Mr. Marchmont's judgment in a thing like that," she said. "He's infallible."

"There's no need of infallibility, my dear," observed Lady Richard irritably. "Ordinary common
sense is quite enough." She turned suddenly on May. "You talked to him for nearly an hour the
other night," she said.

"Yes--how you could!" sighed Fanny.

"I couldn't help it. He talked to me."

"About those great schemes that he's filled poor dear Dick's head with? Not that I doubt he's
got plenty of schemes--of a sort you know."

"He didn't talk schemes," said Lady May. "He was worse than that."

"What did he do?" asked her sister.

"Flirted."

A sort of gasp broke from Lady Richard's lips; she gazed helplessly at her friends. Fanny began
to laugh. May preserved a meditative seriousness; she seemed to be reviewing Quisanté's efforts
in a judicial spirit.

"Well?" said Lady Richard after the proper pause.

"Oh well, he was atrocious, of course," May admitted; her tone, however, expressed a reluctant
homage to truth rather than any resentment. "He doesn't know how to do it in the least."

"He doesn't know how to do anything," Lady Richard declared.

"Most men are either elephantine or serpentine," said Fanny. "Which was he, dear?"

"I don't think either."

"Porcine?" asked Lady Richard.

"No. I haven't got an animal for him. Well, yes, he was a little weaselly perhaps. But----"
She glanced at Lady Richard as she paused, and then appeared to think that she would say no
more; she frowned slightly and then smiled.

"I like his cheek!" exclaimed Fanny with a simplicity that had survived the schoolroom.

Lady Richard screwed her small straight features into wrinkles of disgust and a shrug seemed
to run all over her little trim smartly-gowned figure; no presumption could astonish her in
Quisanté.

"Why in the world did you listen to him, May?" Fanny went on.

"He interested me. And every now and then he was objectionable in rather an original way."

With another shrug, inspired this time by her friend's mental vagaries, Lady Richard diverged
to another point.

"And that was where you were all the time Weston Marchmont was looking for you?" she asked.

May began to laugh. "Somehow I'm generally somewhere else when Mr. Marchmont looks for me,"
she said. "It isn't deliberate, really; I like him very much, but when he comes near me, some
perverse fate seems to set my legs moving in the opposite direction."

"Well, Alexander Quisanté's a perverse fate, if you like," said Lady Richard.

"It's curious how there are people one's like that towards. You're very fond of them, but it
seems quite certain that you'll never get much nearer to them. Is it fate? Or is it that in
the end there's a--a solution of sympathy, a break somewhere, so that you stop just short of
finding them absolutely satisfying?"

Neither of her friends answered her. Lady Richard did not deal in speculations; Fanny preferred
not to discuss, even indirectly, her sister's feelings towards Marchmont; they bred in her
a mixture of resentment and relief too complicated for public reference. It was certainly true
enough that he and May got no nearer to one another; if the break referred to existed somewhere,
its effect was very plain; how could it display itself more strikingly than in making the lady
prefer Quisanté's weaselly flirtation to the accomplished and enviable homage of Weston Marchmont?
And preferred it she had, for one hour of life at least. Fanny felt the anger which we suffer
when another shows indifference towards what we should consider great good fortune.

But indifference was not truly May's attitude towards Marchmont. Nobody, she honestly thought,
could be indifferent to him, to his handsomeness, his grace and refinement, the fine temper
of his mind, his indubitable superiority of intellect; in everything he was immeasurably above
the ordinary run of her acquaintance, the well-groomed inconsiderables of whom she knew such
a number. Being accustomed to look this world in the face unblinkingly, she did not hesitate
to add that he possessed great wealth and the prospect of a high career. He was all, and indeed
rather more, than she, widowed Lady Attlebridge's slenderly dowered daughter, had any reason
to expect. She wanted to expect no more, if possible really to regard this opportunity as greater
luck than she had a right to anticipate. The dissatisfaction which she sought to explain by
talking of a solution of sympathy was very obstinate, but justice set the responsibility down
to her account, not to his; analysing her temperament, without excusing it, she found a spirit
of adventure and experiment--or should she say of restlessness and levity?--which Marchmont
did not minister to nor yet assuage. The only pleasure that lay in this discovery came from
the fact that it was so opposed to the general idea about her. For it was her lot to be exalted
into a type of the splendid calm patrician maiden. In that sort of vein her friends spoke of
her when they were not very intimate, in that sort of language she saw herself described in
gushing paragraphs that chronicled the doings of her class. Stately, gracious, even queenly,
were epithets which were not spared her; it would have been refreshing to find some Diogenes
of a journalist who would have called her, in round set terms, discontented, mutinous, scornful
of the ideal she represented, a very hot-bed of the faults the beauty of whose absence was
declared in her dignified demeanour. Now what May looked, that Fanny was; but poor Fanny, being
slight of build, small in feature, and gay in manner, got no credit for her exalted virtues
and could not be pressed into service as the type of them. For certainly types must look typical.
May's comfort in these circumstances was that Marchmont's perfect breeding and instinctive
avoidance of display, of absurdity, even of betraying any heat of emotion, saved her from the
usual troubles which an unsatisfied lover entails on his mistress. He looked for her no doubt,
but with no greater visible perturbation than if she had been his handkerchief.

An evening or two later Dick Benyon took her in to dinner. Entirely in concession to him--for
the subject had passed from her own thoughts--she asked, "Well, how's your genius going on?"
Before the meal was over she regretted her question. It opened the doors to Dick's confused
eloquence and vague laudations of his protégé; putting Dick on his defence, it involved an
infinite discussion of Quisanté. She was told how Dick had picked him up at Naples, gone to
Pompeii with him, travelled home with him, brought him and Jimmy together, and how the three
had become friends. "And if I'm a fool, my brother's not," said Dick. May knew that Jimmy would
shelter himself under a plea couched in identical language. From this point Dick became less
expansive, for at this point his own benefactions and services had begun. She could not get
much out of him, but she found herself trying to worm out all she could. Dick had no objection
to saying that he had induced Quisanté to go in for politics, and had "squared" the influential
persons who distributed (so far as a free electorate might prove docile) seats in Parliament.
Rumour and Aunt Maria would have supplemented his statement by telling of substantial aid given
by the Benyon brothers. May, interested against her wish and irritated at her interest, yet
not content, like Dick's wife, to shrug away Dick's aberrations, turned on him with a sudden,
"But why, why? Why do you like him?"

"Like him!" repeated Dick half-interrogatively. He did not seem sure that his companion had
chosen the right, or at any rate the best, word to describe his feelings. In response she amended
her question.

"Well, I mean, what do you see in him?"

Here was another fatal question, for Dick saw everything in him. Hastily cutting across the
eulogies, she demanded particulars--who was he, where did he come from, and so forth. On these
heads Dick's account was scanty; Quisanté's father had grown wine in Spain; and Quisanté himself
had an old aunt in London.

"Not much of a genealogy," she suggested. Dick was absurd enough to quote "Je suis un ancêtre."
"Oh, if you're as silly as that!" she exclaimed with an annoyed laugh.

"He's the man we want."

"You and Jimmy?"

"The country," Dick explained gravely. He had plenty of humour for other subjects, but Quisanté,
it seemed, was too sacred. "Look here," he went on. "Come and meet him again. Amy's going out
of town next week and we'll have a little party for him."

"That happens best when Amy's away?"

"Well, women are so----"

"Yes, I know. I'm a woman. I won't come."

Dick looked at her not sourly but sadly, and turned to his other neighbour. May was left to
sit in silence for five minutes; then a pause in Dick's talk gave her time to touch him lightly
on the arm and to say when he turned, "Yes, I will, and thank you."

But she said nothing about the weaselly flirtation.

                             CHAPTER II.

                              MOMENTS.

At the little dinner which Lady Richard's absence rendered more easy there were only the Benyon
brothers (a wag had recently suggested that they should convert themselves into Quisanté Limited),
Mrs. Gellatly, Morewood the painter, and the honoured guest. Morewood was there because he
was painting a kit-cat of Quisanté for the host (Heaven knew in what corner Lady Richard would
suffer it to hang), and Mrs. Gellatly because she had expressed a desire to meet Lady May Gaston.
Quisanté greeted May with an elaborate air of remembrance; his handshake was so ornate as to
persuade her that she must always hate him, and that Dick Benyon was as foolish as his wife
thought him. This mood lasted half through dinner; the worst of Quisanté was uppermost, and
the exhibition depressed the others. The brothers were apologetic, Mrs. Gellatly gallantly
suave; her much-lined, still pretty face worked in laborious smiles at every loudness and every
awkwardness. Morewood was so savage that an abrupt conclusion of the entertainment threatened
to be necessary. May, who had previously decided that Mr. Quisanté would be much better in
company, was travelling to the conclusion that he was not nearly so trying when alone; to be
weaselly is not so bad as to be inconsiderate and ostentatious.

Just then came the change which transformed the party. Somebody mentioned Mahomet; Morewood,
with his love of a paradox, launched on an indiscriminate championship of the Prophet. Next
to believing in nobody, it was best, he said, to believe in Mahomet; there, he maintained,
you got most out of your religion and gave least to it; and he defended the criterion with
his usual uncompromising aggressiveness. Then Quisanté put his arms on the table, interrupted
Morewood without apology, and began to talk. May thought that she would not have known how
good the talk was--for it came so easily--had she not seen how soon Morewood became a listener,
or even a foil, ready and content to put his questions not as puzzles but as provocatives.
Yet Morewood was proverbially conceited, and he was fully a dozen years Quisanté's senior.
She stole a look round; the brothers were open-mouthed, Mrs. Gellatly looked almost frightened.
Next her eyes scanned Quisanté's face; he was not weaselly now, nor ostentatious. His subject
filled him and lit him up; she did not know that he looked as he had when he spoke to old Maria
of his Empress among women, but she knew that he looked as if nothing mentally small, nothing
morally mean, nothing that was not in some way or other, for good or evil, big and spacious
could ever come near him from without or proceed out from him.

She was immensely startled when, in a pause, her host whispered in her ear, "One of his moments!"
The phrase was to become very familiar to her on the lips of others, even more in her own thoughts.
"His moments!" It implied a sort of intermittent inspiration, as though he were some ancient
prophet or mediæval fanatic through whose mouth Heaven spoke sometimes, leaving him for the
rest to his own low and carnal nature. The phrase meant at once a plenitude of inspiration
and a rarity of it. Not days, nor hours, but moments were seemingly what his friends valued
him for, what his believers attached their faith to, what must (if anything could) outweigh
all that piled the scales so full against him. An intense curiosity then and there assailed
her; she must know more of the man; she must launch a boat on this unexplored ocean--for the
Benyons had not navigated it, they only stood gaping on the beach. Here was scope for that
unruly spirit of hers which Marchmont's culture and Marchmont's fascination could neither minister
to nor assuage.

She was gazing intently at Quisanté when she became conscious of Mrs. Gellatly's eyes on her.
Mrs. Gellatly looked frightened still; accustomed tactfully to screen awkwardness, she was
rather at a loss in the face of naked energy. She sought to share her alarm with May Gaston,
but May was like a climber fronted by a mountain range.

"You may be right and you may be wrong," said Morewood. "At least I don't know anybody who
can settle the quarrel between facts and dreams."

"There isn't any quarrel."

"There's a little stiffness anyhow," urged Morewood, still unwontedly docile.

"They'd get on better if they saw more of one another," suggested May timidly. It was her first
intervention. She felt its insignificance. She would not have complained if Quisanté had followed
Morewood's example and taken no notice of it. He stopped, turned to her with exaggerated deference,
and greeted her obvious little carrying out of the metaphor as though it were a heaven-sent
light. Somehow in doing this he seemed to fall all in an instant from lofty heights to depths
almost beyond eyesight. While he complimented her elaborately, Morewood turned away in open
impatience. Another topic was started, the conversation was killed; or, to put it as she put
it to herself, that moment of Quisanté's was ended. Did his moments always end like that? Did
they fade before a breath, like the frailest flower? Did the contemptible always follow in
a flash on the entrancing?

Presently she found a chance for a whisper to Morewood.

"How are you painting him?" she asked.

"You must come and see," he replied, with a rather sour grin.

"So I will, but tell me now. You know the difference, I mean?"

"Oh, and do you already? Well, I shall do him making himself agreeable to a lady."

"For heaven's sake don't!" she whispered, half-laughing yet not without seriousness. The man
was a malicious creature and might well caricature what he was bound to idealise to the extreme
limit of nature's sufferance. Such a trick would be hardly honest to Dick Benyon, but Morewood
would plead his art with unashamed effrontery, and, if more were needed, tell Dick to take
his cheque to the deuce and go with it himself.

The rest of the party was, to put it bluntly, a pleasant little gathering in no way remarkable
and rather spoilt by the presence of one person who was not quite a gentleman. May struggled
hard against the mercilessness of the judgment contained in the last words; for it ought to
have proved quite final as regarded Alexander Quisanté. As a fact it would not leave her mind,
it established an absolutely sure footing in her convictions; and yet it did not seem quite
final in regard to Quisanté. Perhaps Dick Benyon would maintain the proud level of his remark
about the genealogy, and remind her that somebody settled Napoleon's claims by the same verdict.
But one did not meet Napoleon at little dinners, nor think of him with no countervailing achievements
to his name.

Her mind was so full of the man that when she joined her mother at a party later in the evening,
she had an absurd anticipation that everybody would talk to her about him. Nobody did; that
evening an Arctic explorer and a new fortune-teller divided the attention of the polite; men
came and discussed one or other of these subjects with her until she was weary. For once then,
on Marchmont making an appearance near her, her legs did not carry her in the opposite direction;
she awaited and even invited his approach; at least he would spare her the fashionable gossip,
and she thought he might tell her something about Quisanté. In two words he told her, if not
anything about Quisanté, still everything that he himself thought of Quisanté.

"I met Mr. Quisanté at dinner," she said.

"That fellow!" exclaimed Marchmont.

The tone was full of weariness and contempt; it qualified the man as unspeakable and dismissed
him as intolerable. Was Marchmont infallible, as Fanny had said? At least he represented, in
its finest and most authoritative form, the opinion of her own circle, the unhesitating judgment
against which she must set herself if she became Quisanté's champion. It would be much easier,
and probably much more sensible, to fall into line and acquiesce in the condemnation; then
it would matter nothing whether the vulgar did or did not elect to admire Dick Benyon's peculiar
friend. Yet a protest stirred within her; only her sense of the ludicrous prevented her from
adopting Dick's word and asking Marchmont if he had ever seen the fellow in one of his "moments."
But it would be absurd to catch up the phrase like that, and it was by no means certain that
even the moments would appeal to Marchmont.

Looking round, she perceived that a little space in the crowded room had been left vacant about
them; nobody came up to her, no woman, in passing by, signalled to Marchmont; the constant
give-and-take of companions was suspended in their favour. In fine, people supposed that they
wanted to talk to one another; it would not be guessed that one of the pair wished Quisanté
to be the topic.

"He's got some brains," Marchmont went on, "though of rather a flashy sort, I think. Dick Benyon's
been caught by them. But a more impossible person I never met. You don't like him?"

"Yes, I do," she answered defiantly. "At least I do every now and then."

"Pray make the occasions as rare as possible," he urged in his low lazy voice, with his pleasant
smile and a confidential look in his handsome eyes. "And don't let them coincide with my presence."

"Really he won't hurt you; you're too particular."

"No, he won't hurt me, but I should feel rather as though he were hurting you."

"What do you mean?"

"By being near you, certainly by being anything in the least like a friend of yours."

"He'd defile me?" she asked, laughing.

"Yes," said he seriously; the next moment he smiled and shrugged his shoulders; he did not
withdraw his seriousness but he apologised for it.

"Oh, I'd better get under a glass-case at once," she exclaimed, laughing again impatiently.

"Yes, and lock it, and----"

"Give you the key?"

He laughed as he said, "The most artistic emotions have some selfishness in them, I admit it."

"It would make a little variety if I sent a duplicate to Mr. Quisanté!"

Here he would not follow her in her banter. He grew grave and even frowned, but all he said
was, "Really there are limits, you know." It was her own verdict, expressed more tersely, more
completely, and more finally. There were limits, and Alexander Quisanté was beyond them; the
barrier they raised could not be surmounted; he could not fly over it even on the wings of
his moments.

"You above everybody oughtn't to know such people," Marchmont went on.

Now he was thinking of the type she was supposed to represent; that was the fashion in which
it was appropriate to talk to the type.

"I'm not in the very least like that really," she assured him. "If you knew me better you'd
find that out very soon."

"I'm willing to risk it."

Flirtation for flirtation--and this conversation was becoming one--there could be no comparison
between Marchmont's and Quisanté's; the one was delightful, the other odious; the one combined
charm with dignity; the other was a mixture of cringing and presumption. May put the contrast
no less strongly than this as she yielded to the impulse of the minute and gave the lie to
Marchmont's ideal of her by her reckless acceptance of the immediate delights he offered. The
ideal would no doubt cause him to put a great deal of meaning into her acceptance; whether
such meaning were one she would be prepared to indorse her mood did not allow her to consider.
She showed him very marked favour that evening, and in his company contrived to forget entirely
the puzzle of Quisanté and his moments, and the possible relation of those moments to the limits
about which her companion was so decisive.

At last, however, they were interrupted. The interruption came from Dick Benyon, who had looked
in somewhere else and arrived now at the tail of the evening. Far too eager and engrossed in
his great theme to care whether his appearance were welcome, he dashed up to May, crying out
even before he reached her, "Well, what do you say about him now? Wasn't he splendid?"

Clearly Dick forgot his earlier apologetic period; for him the moment was the evening. A cool
question from Marchmont, the cooler perhaps for annoyance, forced Dick into explanations, and
he sketched in his summary fashion the incident which had aroused his enthusiasm and made him
look so confidently for a response from May. Marchmont was unreservedly and almost scornfully
antagonistic.

"Oh, you're too cultivated to live," cried Dick. "Now isn't he too elegant, May?"

"I'm not the least elegant," said Marchmont, with quiet confidence. "But I'm--well, I'm what
Quisanté isn't. So are you, Dick."

"Suppose we are, and by Jove, isn't he what we aren't? I'm primitive, I suppose. I think hands
and brains are better than manners."

"I'll agree, but I don't like his hands or his brains either."

"He'll mount high."

"As high as Haman. I shouldn't be the least surprised to see it."

"Well, I'm not going to give him up because he doesn't shake hands at the latest fashionable
angle."

"All right, Dick. And I'm not going to take him up because he's a dab at rodomontade."

"And you neither of you need fight about him," May put in, laughing. They joined in her laugh,
each excusing himself by good-natured abuse of the other.

There was no question of a quarrel, but the divergence was complete, striking, and even startling.
To one all was black, to the other all white; to one all tin, to the other all gold. Was there
no possibility of compromise? As she sat between the two, May thought that a discriminating
view of Quisanté ought to be attainable, not an oscillation from disgust to admiration, but
a well-balanced stable judgment which should allow full value to merits and to defects, and
sum up the man as a whole. Something of the sort she tried to suggest; neither disputant would
hear of it, and Marchmont went off with an unyielding assertion that the man was a cad, no
more and no less than a cad. Dick looked after him with a well-satisfied air; May fancied that
opposition and the failure of others to understand intensified his satisfaction in his own
discovery. But he grew mournful as he said to her,

"I shan't have a chance with you now. You'll go with Marchmont of course. And I did want you
to like him."

"Mr. Marchmont doesn't control my opinions."

They were very old friends; Dick allowed himself a significant smile.

"I know what you mean," she said, smiling. "But it's nonsense. Besides, look at yourself and
Amy! She hates him, and yet you----"

"Oh, she's only half-serious, and Marchmont's in deadly earnest under that deuced languid manner
of his. I tell you what, he's a very limited fellow, after all."

May laughed; the limits were being turned to a new use now.

"Awfully clever and well-read, but shut up inside a sort of compartment of life. Don't you
know what I mean? He's always ridden first-class, and he won't believe there's anybody worth
knowing in the thirds."

"You think he's like that?" she asked thoughtfully.

"You can see it for yourself. There's no better fellow, no better friend, but, hang it, an
oyster's got a broader mind."

"I like broad minds."

"Then you'll like Quis----"

"Absolutely you shan't mention that name again. Find mother for me and tell her to tell me
that it's time to go home."

Going home brought with it a discovery. May was considered to have invited the world to take
notice of her preference for Marchmont. This fact was first conveyed to her by Lady Attlebridge's
gently affectionate and congratulatory air; at this May was little more than amused. Evidence
of greater significance lay in Fanny's demeanour; she came into her sister's room and talked
for a while; before leaving, but after the ordinary kiss of goodnight, she came back suddenly
and kissed her again; she said nothing, but the embrace was emphatic and eloquent. It seemed
to the recipient to be forgiving also; it meant "I want you to be happy, don't imagine I think
of anything else." If Fanny kissed her like that, it was because Fanny supposed that she had
made up her mind to marry Weston Marchmont. She was fully conscious that the inference was
not a strange one to draw from her conduct that evening. But now the mood of impulse was entirely
gone; she considered the matter in a cool spirit, and her talk with Dick Benyon assumed unlooked-for
importance in her deliberations. To marry Marchmont was a step entirely in harmony with the
ideal which her family and the world had of her, which Marchmont himself most thoroughly and
undoubtingly believed in. If she were really what she was supposed to be, the match would satisfy
her as well as it would everybody else. But if she were quite different in her heart? In that
case it might indeed be urged that no marriage would or could permanently satisfy her or the
whole of her nature. This was likely enough; to see how often something of that kind happened
it was, unfortunately, only necessary to run over ten or a dozen names which offered themselves
promptly enough from the list of her acquaintance. Still to marry knowing you would not be
satisfied was to drop below the common fate of marrying knowing that you might not be; it gave
up the golden chance; it abandoned illusion just where illusion seemed most necessary.

Oh for life, for the movement of life! It is perhaps hard to realise how often that cry breaks
from the hearts of women. No doubt the aspiration it expresses is rather apt to end in antics,
not edifying to the onlooker, hardly (it may be supposed) comforting to the performer. But
the antics are one thing, the aspiration another, and they have the aspiration strongest who
condemn and shun the antics. The matter may be stated very simply, at least if the form in
which it presented itself to May Gaston in her twenty-third year be allowed to suffice. Most
girls are bred in a cage, most girls expect to escape therefrom by marriage, most girls find
that they have only walked into another cage. She had nothing to say, so far as her own case
went, against the comfort either of the old or of the new cage; they were both indeed luxurious.
But cages they were and such she knew them to be. Doubtless there must be limits, not only
to the tolerance of Weston Marchmont and of society, but to everything else except infinity.
But there are great expanses, wide spaces, short of infinity. When she walked out of her first
cage, the one which her mother's careful fingers had kept locked on her, she would like not
to walk into another, but to escape into some park or forest, not boundless, yet so large as
to leave room for exploring, for the finding of new things, for speculation, for doubt, excitement,
uncertainty, even for the presence of apprehension and the possibility of danger. As she surveyed
the manner in which she was expected to pass her life, the manner in which she was supposed
(she faced now the common interpretation of her conduct this evening) already to have elected
to pass it, she felt as a speculator feels towards Consols, as a gambler towards threepenny
whist. It seemed as though nothing could be good which did not also hold within it the potency
of being very bad, as though certainty damned and chance alone had lures to offer. She would
have liked to take life in her hand--however precious a thing, what use is it if you hoard
it?--and see what she could make of it, what usury its free loan to fate and fortune would
earn. She might lose it; youth made light of the risk. She might crawl back in sad plight;
the Prodigal Son did not think of that when he set out. She found herself wishing she had nothing,
that she might be free to start on the search for anything.

Like Quisanté? Why, yes, just like Quisanté. Like that strange, intolerable, vulgar, attractive,
intermittently inspired creature, who presented himself at life's roulette-table, not less
various in his own person than were the varying turns he courted, unaccountable as chance,
baffling as fate, changeable as luck. Indeed he was like life itself, a thing you loved and
hated, grew weary of and embraced, shrank from and pursued. To see him then was in a way to
look on at life, to be in contact with him was to feel the throb of its movement. In her midnight
musings the man seemed somehow to cease to be odious because he ceased to be individual, to
be no longer incomprehensible because he was no longer apart, because he became to her less
himself and more the expression and impersonation of an instinct that in her own blood ran
riot and held festivity.

"I'm having moments, like Mr. Quisanté himself!" she said with a sudden laugh.

                             CHAPTER III.

                             SANDRO'S WAY.

First to the City, then to the doctor, then to the House, then to the dinner of the Imperial
League; this was Quisanté's programme for the second Wednesday in April. It promised a busy
day. But of the doctor and the House he made light; the first was a formality, the second held
out no prospect of excitement; the City and the dinner were the real things. They were connected
with and must be made to promote the two aims which he had taken for his with perfect confidence.
He wanted money and he wanted position; he saw no reason why he should not attain both in the
fullest measure. Recent events had filled him with a sure and certain hope. Not allowing for
the value of the good manners which he lacked, he failed to see that he excited any hostility
or any distaste. Unless a man were downright rude to him, he counted him an adherent; this
streak of a not unpleasing simplicity ran across his varied nature. He was far from being alive
to his disadvantages; every hour assured him of his superiority. Most especially he counted
on the aid and favour of women; the future might prove him right or wrong in his expectation;
but he relied for its realisation not on the power which he did possess but on an accomplishment
of manner and an insinuating fascination which he most absolutely lacked. The ultra-civility
which repelled May Gaston was less a device than an exhibition; he embarked on it more because
he thought he did it well than (as she supposed) from a desire to curry favour. He was ill-bred,
but he was not mean; he was a vaunter but not a coward; he demanded adherence and did not beg
alms. This was the attitude of his mind, but unhappily it was often apparently contradicted
by the cringing of his body and the wheedling of his tongue. In attempting smoothness he fell
into oiliness; where he aimed at polished brilliance, the result was blazing varnish. Had he
known what to pray for, he would have supplicated heaven that he might meet eyes able to see
the man beneath the ape. Such eyes, dimly penetrating with an unexpected vision, he had won
to his side in the Benyon brothers; the rest of the world still stuck on the outside surface.
But the brothers could only shield him, they could not change him; they might promote his fortunes,
they could not cure his vices. He did not know that he had any vices; the first stage of amendment
was still to come.

He had a cousin in the City, a stock-jobber, who made and lost large sums of money as fortune
smiled or frowned. Quisanté had the first five hundred of Aunt Maria's thousand pounds in his
pocket and told his kinsman to use it for him.

"A spec?" asked Mr. Josiah Mandeville. "Isn't that rather rough on Aunt Maria?"

Quisanté looked surprised. "She gave it me, I haven't stolen it," he said with a laugh.

"She gave it you to live on, to keep up your position, I suppose."

"I don't think she made any conditions. And if I can make money, I'll give it back to her."

"Oh, you know best, I suppose," said Mandeville. "Only if I lose it?"

"Losing money's no worse than spending it." He don mind. Electricity yes nay, problem to appear why have
him to quality along-good and could be old.

 Marchmont proceeded to remark
that in his doubtless out-of-date view the best thing was to preserve the traditions and the
traditional limits of Church work and Church influence. He did not say in so many words that
the Church was a good servant but a bad master, yet Dick and the Dean gathered that this was
his opinion, and that he would look with apprehension on any movement directed to bringing
ecclesiastical pressure to bear on secular affairs. In all this he assumed politely that the
Crusade could succeed, but the lift of his brows which accompanied the concession was very
eloquent.

"Then," he ended apologetically, "there's the danger of vulgarity. One puts up with that in
politics, but I confess I shrink from it in religion."

"What appeals to everybody is not necessarily vulgar," said the Dean.

"Not necessarily," Marchmont agreed, with the emphasis on the second word. "But," he added,
"it's almost of necessity untrue, and after all religion has to do with truth." He was getting
near his ultimates again.

There was a pause; then Marchmont laughed and said jokingly,

"You'll have to go to the Radicals, Dick. They're the dogmatic party nowadays, and they'll
be just as ready to manage your soul for you as they are your property."

"That's just what I don't mean to do," said Dick obstinately. But he looked a little uncomfortable.
It was important to preserve the attitude that fighting the Radicals was no part of the scheme
of the Crusade. Marchmont smiled at the Dean across the table.

"I love the Church, Mr. Dean," he said, "but I'm afraid of the churchmen."

"Much what I feel about politics and politicians."

"Then if churchmen are politicians too----?" Marchmont suggested; the Dean's laughter admitted
a verbal defeat. But when Marchmont had gone he shook his head over him again, saying, "He'll
not be great; he's much too sane."

"He's too scrupulous," said Dick. The Dean protested with a smile. "I mean too fastidious,"
Dick added, correcting himself.

"Yes, yes, too fastidious," agreed the Dean contentedly. "And when I said sane perhaps I rather
meant cautious, unimaginative, and cold." Both felt the happier for the withdrawal of their
hastily chosen epithets.

This conversation had occurred in the early days of Dick's acquaintance with Alexander Quisanté,
when, although already much taken with the man, he had a clearer view of what he was than enthusiasm
allowed later on. Rejecting Marchmont, or rather acquiescing in Marchmont's refusal, on the
ground of his excessive caution, his want of imagination, and his fastidiousness, he had hesitated
to sound Quisanté in regard to the great project. It seemed to him impossible to regard his
new friend as an ideal leader for this purpose; one reason is enough to indicate--the ideal
leader should be absolutely unselfish by nature. By nature Quisanté was very far from that,
and his circumstances were not such as to enable him to overcome the bent of his disposition;
whatever else he was or might become, he would be self-seeking too, and it would be impossible
ever to make him steadily and deliberately forgetful of himself.

But as time went on, another way opened before Dick's eyes and was cautiously and tentatively
hinted at to his confidant, the Dean. The Dean, having seen a little and heard much of Quisanté,
was inclined to be encouraging. There were in him possibilities not to be found in Marchmont.
He was not fastidious, he would not trouble himself or other people about ultimates, above
all he could be fired with imagination. Once that was achieved, he would speak and seem as
though he were all that the ideal leader ought to be, as though inspiration filled him; he
would express what Dick could only feel and the Dean do no more than adumbrate; nay, in time,
as he grew zealous in the cause, his self-interest and personal ambition would be conquered,
or at least would be so blended and fused with the nobility of the cause as to lose any grossness
or meanness which might be thought to characterise them in an uncompounded condition. All this
might be achieved if only the great idea could be made to seem great enough and the potentialities
which lay in its realisation invested with enough pomp and dignity. After all was not such
a blend of things personal and things beyond and higher than the personal as much as could
reasonably be expected from human beings, and adequate to the needs of a work-a-day world?

"I don't want to be a bishop, but I do mean to stick to my deanery through thick and thin,"
said the Dean, smiling. Dick understood him to mean that allowance must be made for the personal
element, and that a man might serve a cause very usefully without being prepared to go quite
as far as the stake, or even the workhouse, for it; if this were not so, there would be less
competition for places in State and Church.

Such great schemes for causing right ideas to prevail in things spiritual and temporal and
for placing the right men in the right positions to ensure this important result are material
here only so far as they influence the career or illustrate the character of individuals. The
Crusade did not perhaps do as much towards altering the face of the world, or even of this
island, as it was intended to, but it had a considerable, if temporary, effect on current politics,
and it appeared to Quisanté to be at once a fine conception and a notable opportunity; between
these two aspects he did not, as Dick Benyon had foreseen, draw any very rigid line. To make
the Church again a power with the masses; this done, to persuade the masses to use their power
under the leadership of the Church; this done, to harmonise unimpaired liberty of conscience
with a whole-hearted devotion to truth, and to devote both to ends which should unite the maximum
of zeal for the Community with the minimum of political innovation, were aims which, if they
were nothing else, might at least claim to be worthy to exercise the intellect of superior
men and to inspire the eloquence of orators. That a set of people on the other side was professing
to do the same things, with totally different and utterly wrong notions of the results to be
obtained, afforded the whet of antagonism, and let in dialectic and partisanship as a seasoning
to relieve the high severity of the main topic. Quisanté's personal relations with the Church
had never been intimate; he was perhaps the better able to lay hold of its romantic and picturesque
aspect. The Dean, for instance, was hampered and at times discouraged by a knowledge of details.
Dick Benyon had to struggle against the family point of view as regarded the family livings.
Quisanté came almost as a stranger, ready to be impressed, to take what suited him, to form
the desired opinion and no other; if a legal metaphor may be allowed, to master what was in
his brief, to use that to the full, and to know nothing to the contrary. The Empire was very
well, but it was a crowded field; the new subject had advantages all its own and especial allurements.

Yet Miss Quisanté laughed, as a man's relatives often will although the rest of the world is
unimpeachably grave. For any person engaged in getting a complete view of Alexander Quisanté
it was well to turn from Dick Benyon to Aunt Maria. So May Gaston found when she took the old
woman at her word and went to see her, unaccompanied by Lady Attlebridge. She listened awhile
to her caustic talk and then charged her roundly with not doing justice to her nephew.

"Sandro's caught you too, has he?" was her hostess's immediate retort.

"No, he hasn't caught me, as you call it, Miss Quisanté," said May, smiling. "I dislike a great
deal in him." She paused before adding, "What's more, I've told him so."

"He'll be very pleased at that."

"He didn't seem to be."

"I didn't say he was pleased, I said he would be," remarked Aunt Maria placidly. "No doubt
you vexed him at the time, but when he's thought it over, he'll be flattered at your showing
so much interest in him."

"I shouldn't like him to take it like that," said May thoughtfully.

"It's the true way to take it, though."

"Well then, I suppose it is. Except that there's no reason why my interest should flatter anybody."
She determined on an offensive movement against the sharp confident old lady. "All his faults
are merely faults of bringing up. You brought him up; why didn't you bring him up better?"

Miss Quisanté looked at her for several moments.

"I didn't bring him up well, that's true enough," she said. "But, my dear, don't you run off
with the idea that there's nothing wrong with Sandro except his manners."

"That's exactly the idea I have about him," May persisted defiantly.

"Ah!" sighed Aunt Maria resignedly. "Probably you'll never know him well enough to find out
your mistake."

Warnings pique curiosity as often as they arouse prudence.

"I intend to know him much better if he'll let me," said May.

"Oh, he'll let you." The old lady's gaze was very intent; she had by now made up her mind that
this must be Sandro's Empress. Had she been omnipotent, she would at that moment have decreed
that Sandro should never see his Empress again; she was quite clear that he and his Empress
would not be good for one another. "I begin to hear them talking about him," she went on with
a chuckle. "He's coming into fashion, he's to be the new man for a while. You London people
love a new man just as you do a new craze. You're fine talkers too. I like your buzz. It's
a great hum, hum, buzz, buzz. It turns some men's heads, but it only sharpens others' wits;
it won't turn Sandro's head."

"I'm glad you allow him some virtues."

"Oh, if it's a virtue to look so straight forward to where you mean to get that nothing will
turn your head away from it."

"That's twisting your own words, Miss Quisanté. I don't think he's that sort of man at all;
he isn't the least your--your iron adventurer. He's full of emotion, of feeling, of--well,
almost of poetry. Oh, not always good poetry, I know. But how funny that I should be defending
him and you attacking him; it would be much more natural the other way round."

"I don't see that. I know him better than you do. Now he's to champion the Church--or some
such nonsense! What's Sandro got to do with your Church? What does he care about it?"

"He cared about his subject the other evening; you must admit that."

"Oh, his subject! Yes, he cares about it while it's his subject."

May laughed. "I want to take just one liberty, Miss Quisanté," she said. "May I? I want to
tell you that I think you're a great deal more than half wrong about your nephew."

"Even if I am, I'm right enough for practical purposes with the other part," said the obstinate
old woman. She leant forward and spoke with a sudden bitter emphasis. "It's not all outside,
he's wrong inside too."

"It's too bad of you, oh, it really is," cried May indignantly. "You who ought to stand up
for him and be his greatest friend!"

"Oh, yes, I see! I've overshot my mark. I'm a blunderer."

"Your mark? What mark? Why do you want to tell me about him at all?"

"I don't," said Miss Quisanté, folding her hands in her lap and assuming an air of resolute
reticence. But her eyes dwelt now with an imperfectly disguised kindness on the tall fair girl
who pleaded for justice and saw no justice in the answers that she got. But the more Aunt Maria
inclined to like May Gaston, the more determined was she not to palter with truth, the more
determined to have no hand in giving the girl a false idea of Sandro. So far as lay in her
power, Sandro's Empress should know the whole truth about Sandro.

The buzz of London, to which Miss Quisanté referred as beginning to sound her nephew's name,
revealed to the ear three tolerably distinct notes. There were the people who laughed and said
the thing was no affair of theirs; this section was of course the largest, embracing all the
naturally indifferent as well as the solid mass of the opposite political party. There were
the people who were angry at Dick Benyon's interference and at his protégé's impudence; in
the ranks of these were most of Dick's political comrades, together with their wives and daughters.
Here the resentment was at the idea that there was any vacancy, actual or prospective, which
could not be filled perfectly well without the intrusion of such a person as Quisanté. Thirdly
there was the small but gradually growing group which inclined to think that there was something
in Dick's notions and a good deal in his friend's head. A reinforcement came no doubt from
the persons who were naturally prone to love the new and took up Quisanté as a welcome change,
as something odd, with a flavour of the unknown and just a dash of the mystery-man about him.

The Quisanté-ites had undoubtedly something to say for themselves and something to show for
their faith. Handicapped as he was by his sensational success at the Imperial League dinner,
with its theatrical and faintly suspicious climax, Quisanté had begun well in the House. He
broke away from his mentor's advice; Dick had been for more sensation, for storming the House;
Quisanté rejected the idea and made a quiet, almost hesitating, entry on the scene. He displayed
here a peculiarity which soon came to be remarked in him; on public occasions and in regard
to public audiences he possessed a tact and a power of understanding the feelings of his company
which entirely and even conspicuously failed him in private life. The House did not like being
stormed, especially on the strength of an outside reputation; he addressed it modestly, bringing
into play, however, resources with which he had not been credited--a touch of humour and a
pretty turn of sarcasm. He knew his facts too, and disposed of contradictions with a Blue-book
and a smile. The hypercritical were not silenced; Marchmont still found the smile oily, and
his friends traced the humour to districts which they supposed to lie somewhere east of the
London Hospital; but they were bound to admit sorrowfully that, although all this was true,
it might not, under democratic institutions, prove fatal to a career.

Dick Benyon was enthusiastic; he told his friend that he had scored absolutely off his own
bat and that there was and could be no more question of help or obligation. He was rather surprised
by a display of feeling on Quisanté's part which seemed to indicate almost an excess of gratitude;
but Quisanté felt his foot on the ladder, and the wells of emotion were full to overflowing.
Dick escaped in considerable embarrassment, telling himself that remarkable men could not be
expected to behave just like other men, like his sort of man, but wishing they would. None
the less he praised what he hardly liked, and the reputation of being a good friend was added
to Quisanté's credentials. Lastly, but far from least in importance, a story went the rounds
that a very great veteran, who had taken a keen interest in Weston Marchmont, and designated
him for high place in a future not remote, had recently warned him, in apparent jest indeed
but with unmistakable significance, that it would not do to take things too easily, or let
a rival obtain too long a start. There was nobody of whom the Statesman could be supposed to
be thinking, except the dark horse that Dick Benyon had brought into the betting--Alexander
Quisanté! Such predictions from such quarters have no small power of self-verification; they
predispose lesser men to a fatalistic acquiescence which smoothes the way of the prophecy.

Marchmont, scorning the rival, was inclined to despise the dangers of the contest, but his
supineness may have been in part due to the occupation of his mind by another interest. He
had come to the conclusion that he wanted May Gaston for his wife and that she would accept
his proposal. A few days before the Easter holidays began he betook himself to Lady Attlebridge's
with the intention of settling the matter there and then. The purpose of his coming seemed
to be divined; he was shown direct to May's own room, and found her there alone. She had been
reading a letter and laid it down on a table by her; Marchmont could not help his eye catching
the large printed address at the head of the sheet of paper, "Ashwood." Ashwood was Dick Benyon's
country place. A moment later May explained the letter.

"I've had a wail from Amy Benyon," she said. "She wants me to go to them for Easter and comfort
her. Look what she writes: "You must come, dear. I must be helped through, I must have a refuge.
How in the world I ever did such a thing I don't know! But I did and I can't help it now. He's
coming! So you must come. We expect the Baxters and Mr. Morewood. But I want you.""

"What has she done? Who's coming?" asked Marchmont.

"Mr. Quisanté."

He paused for a moment before he said, "You won't go, I suppose?"

"I must go if Amy wants me as much as that. Besides--well, perhaps it'll be interesting."

A chill fell on Marchmont, and its influence spread to his companion. Here at least he had
hoped to be rid of Quisanté, to find a place where the man could not be met, and people to
whom the man was as a friend impossible. Then if you are working Ghetto-while-- had quisanté Husband-activity

 Disappointed in the half-conscious anticipation which had brought
her to Ashwood, she began to veer towards the obvious, towards safety, and towards Weston Marchmont.
He had allowed himself one letter, not urging her, but very gracefully and feelingly expressed.
As she walked through the village, the telegraph-office tempted her; her life could be settled
for sixpence, and there would be no need of further thought or trouble. She was again held
back by a rather impalpable influence, by a vague unwillingness to cut herself off (as she
would by such a step) from the mental stir which, beneath the apparent quiet of country-house
life, permeated Ashwood. The stir was there, though it defied definition; it was not due to
Dick or the Dean, though they shared in it; it was the mark of Quisanté's presence, the atmosphere
he carried with him. She recognised this with a mixture of feelings; she was ashamed to dwell
on his small faults in face of such a thing; she was afraid to find how strong his attraction
grew in spite of the intolerable drawbacks. Wavering again, she could not decide whether his
faults were fatal defects or trifling foibles.

She saw that the Dean shared her doubts and her puzzle. He had a little trick, an involuntary
and unconscious shake of the head which indicated, as her study of it told her, not a mere
difference of opinion, but a sort of moral distaste for what was said; it reminded her of a
dog shaking his coat to get rid of a splash of dirty water. She came to watch for it when Alexander
Quisanté was talking, and to find that it agreed wonderfully well with the invisible movements
of her own mind; it came when the man was petty, or facetious on untimely occasions, or when
he betrayed blindness to the finer shades of right and wrong. But for all this the Dean did
not give up Quisanté; for all this he and Dick Benyon clung to their scheme and to the man
who was to carry it out. In her urgent desire for guidance she took the Dean for a walk and
tried to draw out his innermost opinions. He showed some surprise at her interest.

"He's the last man I should have thought you'd care to know about, Lady May," he said.

"That can be only because you think me stupid," she retorted, smiling.

"No! But I thought you'd be stopped in limine--on the threshold, you know."

"I see the threshold; and, yes, I don't like it. But tell me about the house too."

"I've not seen it all," smiled the Dean. "Well, to drop our metaphor, I think Mr. Quisanté
has a wonderfully acute intellect."

"Oh, yes, yes."

"And hardly a wonderfully, but a rather noticeably, blunt conscience. Many men have, you'll
say, I know. But most of the men we meet have substitutes."

"Substitutes for conscience?" May laughed reprovingly at her companion.

"Taste, tradition, the rules of society, what young men call 'good form.'"

"Ah, yes. And he hasn't?"

"His bringing up hasn't given them to him. He might learn them."

"Who from?"

"One would have hoped from our host, but I see no signs of it." The Dean paused, shaking his
head "A woman might teach him." He paused again before adding with emphasis, "But I should
be very sorry for her."

"Why?" The brief question was asked with averted eyes.

"Because the only woman who could do it must be the sort of woman who--whose teeth would be
set on edge by him every day till the process--the quite uncertain process--was complete."

"Yes, she'd have to be that," murmured May Gaston.

"On the whole I think she'd have an unhappy life, and very likely fail. But I also think that
it would be the only way." His round face broke again into its cheerful smile. "We shall have
to make the best of him as he is, Lady May," he ended. "Heaven forbid that I should encourage
any woman to the task!"

"I certainly don't think you seem likely to," she said with a laugh. "It seems to come to this:
his manners are bad and his morals are worse."

"Yes, I think so."

"But, as Dick Benyon would say, so were Napoleon's."

"Exactly, and, as we know, Napoleon's wife was not to be envied."

May Gaston was silent for a moment; then she said meditatively, "Oh, don't you think so?",
and fell again into a long silence. The Dean did not break it; his thoughts had wandered from
the hypothetical lady who was to redeem Quisanté to the realities of the great Crusade.

There seemed to May something a little inhuman in the Dean's attitude, and indeed in the way
in which everybody at Ashwood regarded Quisanté. Not even Dick Benyon was altogether free from
this reproach, in spite of his enthusiasm and his resulting blindness to Quisanté's lesser,
but not less galling, faults. Not even to Dick was he a real friend; none of them took him
or offered to take him into their inner lives, or allowed him to share their deepest sympathies.
Perhaps this was only to treat him as he deserved to be treated; if he asked nothing but a
mutual usefulness and accommodation, that they should use him and he should rise by serving
them, neither party was deceived and neither had any cause to complain. But if after all the
man was like most men, if his chilly childhood and his lonely youth had left him with any desire
for unreserved companionship, for true friendship, or for love, then to acquiesce in his bad
manners and his worse morals, to be content (as the Dean said) to make the best of him--out
of him would have been a more sincere form of expression--as he was, seemed in some sort cruelty;
it was like growing rich out of the skill of your craftsmen and yet taking no interest in their
happiness or welfare. It was to use him only as a means, and to be content in turn to be to
him only a means; such a relative position excluded true human intercourse, and, it appeared
to May, must intensify the faults from which it arose. Even here, in this house, Quisanté was
almost a stranger; the rest were easy with one another, their presence was natural and came
of itself; he alone was there for a purpose, came from outside, and required to be accounted
for. If the talk with the Dean confirmed apprehensions already existing, on the other hand
it raised a new force of sympathy and a fresh impulse to kindness. But the sympathy and the
apprehensions could make no treaty; fierce war waged between them.

That night the turn of events served Quisanté. He seemed ill and tired, yet he had flashes
of brilliancy. Again it was made plain that, all said and done, his was the master mind there;
even Lady Richard had to listen and Fred Wentworth to wonder unwillingly where the fellow got
his notions. After dinner he talked to them, and they gave him all their ears until he chose
to cease and sank back wearied in his chair. But then came the contrast. The Dean went to the
library, Lady Richard strolled out of doors with Fred, Mrs. Baxter withdrew into seclusion
with a novel and a petticoat, Dick Benyon asked May to walk in the garden with him, and when
she refused went off to play billiards with Morewood. May had pleaded letters to write and
sat down to the task. The man who a little while ago had been the centre of attention was left
alone. He wandered about idly for a few moments, then dropped into a chair, seeming too tired
to read, looking fretful, listless, solitary and sad. She watched him furtively for some time
from behind the tall sides of the old-fashioned escritoire; he sat very still, stretched out,
frowning, pale. Suddenly she rose and crossed the room.

"It's too much trouble to write letters," she said. "Are you inclined for a stroll, Mr. Quisanté?"

He sprang up, a sudden gleam darting into his eyes. She was afraid he would make some ornate
speech, but perhaps he was startled into simplicity, perhaps only at a loss; he stammered out
no more than "Thanks, very much," and followed her through the doorway on to the gravel-walk.
For a little while she did not speak, then she said,

"It's good of you to be friends with me again. I was very impertinent that night after your
speech. I don't know what made me do it."

He did not answer, and she turned to find his eyes fixed intently on her face.

"We are friends again, aren't we?" she asked rather nervously; she knew that she risked a renewal
of the flirtation, and if it were again what it had been her friendship could scarcely survive
the trial. "I shouldn't have said it," she went on, "if I hadn't--I mean, if your speech hadn't
seemed so great to me. But you forgive me, don't you?"

"Oh yes, Lady May. I know pretty well what you think of me." His lips shut obstinately for
a moment. "But I shall go my way and do my work all the same--good manners or bad, you know."

"Those are very bad ones," she said, with a little laugh. Then she grew grave and went on imploringly,
"Don't take it like that. You talk as if we--I don't mean myself, I mean all of us--were enemies,
people you had to fight and beat. Don't think of us like that. We want to be your friends,
indeed we do."

"For whom are you speaking?" he asked in a low hard voice.

She glanced at him. Had he divined the thought which the Dean's talk had put into her head?
Did he feel himself a mere tool, always an outsider, in the end friendless? If he discerned
this truth, no words of hers could throw his keen-scented mind off the track. She fell back
on simple honesty, on the strength of a personal assurance and a personal appeal.

"At any rate I speak for myself," she said. "I can answer for myself. I want to be friends."

"In spite of my manners?" He was bitter and defiant still.

"They grow worse every minute; and your morals are no better, I'm told."

"I daresay not," said Quisanté with a short laugh.

"Oh, say you won't be friends, if you don't want to! Be simple. There, I say it again. Be simple."

Lady Richard's merry laugh rang through the garden, and a brusque "Damn it!" of Morewood's
floated out from the open window of the billiard-room. There was an odd contrast to this cheerful
levity in the man's pale drawn face as he looked into May Gaston's eyes.

"Do you really mean what you say?" he asked. "Or are you only trying to be kind, to put me
at my ease?"

"It's nobody's fault but your own that you're not always at your ease," she replied. The rest
she let pass; when she asked him to walk with her she had only been trying to be kind, and
she had been fearful of what her kindness might entail on her. But things went well; he was
not flirting and he was not acting; his manners, if still bad, were just now at least not borrowed,
they were home-grown.

"I am at my ease," he told her. "At least, I was till----" He hesitated, and then went on slowly,
"Don't you suppose I've been thinking about what you said?"

"I hope not; it wasn't worth it."

"It was. But how can I change?" His voice had a touch of despair as well as of defiance. "I
don't see what you mean; I don't feel what you mean. Yes, and you talk of morals too. Well,
don't I know that every now and then I--I don't see those either?" He paused. "A man must get
on as well as he can with what he's got," he resumed. "If he's only got one eye, he must learn
to be sharper than other men in looking round."

They walked on in silence for some way. His pride and his recognition of his defects, his defiance
and his pleading for himself, combined to touch her heart, and she could not at the moment
speak to him more about them. And to find all that so near the surface, so eager for utterance,
ready to break out at the least encouragement, at the first sign of sympathy! For it had not
come home to her yet that another might have spoken to him as she had, but found no response
and opened the gates to no confidence; she had not guessed what Aunt Maria had about the Empress
among women.

"You're ill too," she said.

"No, not for me," he answered. "I'm pretty well for me."

"Are you never really well?"

"My body's not much better than the other things. But I must use that too, as long as it'll
last." There was no appeal for pity in his voice; defiance was still uppermost. May felt that
she must not let him see that she pitied him, either for his bad body, or his bad manners,
or his bad morals, or his want of friends. He thought he had as much to give as to receive.
She smiled for a moment. But swift came the question--Was he wrong? But whether he were in
fact right or wrong, it was harder to deal with him on the basis of this equality than to stoop
to him in the mere friendliness of compassion. The compassion touched him only, to accept the
equality was to make admissions about herself.

He was very silent and quiet; this might be due to illness or fatigue. But he was also curiously
free from tricks, simple, not exhibiting himself. These were the signs of one of his moments;
but what brought about a moment now? A moment needed a great subject, a spur to his imagination,
an appeal to his deep emotions, a theme, an ideal. The moments had not seemed to May things
that would enter into or have any concern with private life and intimate talks; they belonged
to Dick Benyon's dark horse, not to the mere man Alexander Quisanté. Or had she a little misunderstood
the mere man? The thought crossed her mind that, even if she adopted this conclusion and contrived
to come to a better understanding of him, it would be impossible to make the rest of the world,
of the world in which she lived and to which she clung, see anything of what she saw. They
would laugh if her new position were a passing whim; they would be scornful and angry if it
were anything more.

Suddenly Quisanté spoke. What he said was not free from consciousness of self, from that perpetual
presence of self to self which is common enough in men of great ability and ambition, and yet
never ceases to be a flaw; but he said it soberly enough; there were no flourishes.

"You can't be half-friends with me," he said. "I must be taken as I am, good and bad. You must
let me alone, or take me for better for worse."

May smiled at the phrase he had happened on and its familiar associations--surely so out of
place here. But she followed his meaning and appreciated his seriousness. She could answer
him neither by an only half-sincere assurance that she was ready to be entire friends, nor
yet by a joking evasion of his point.

"Yes, I see: I expect that is so," she said in a troubled voice; it was so very hard to take
him for worse, and it was rather hard to resolve to make no effort at taking him for better.
She forced a laugh, as she said, "I'll think about it, Mr. Quisanté."

As she spoke, she raised her eyes to his; a low, hardly audible exclamation escaped her lips
before she was conscious of it. If ever a man spoke plainly without words what was in his soul,
Quisanté spoke it then. She could not miss the meaning of his eyes; all unprepared as she was,
it came home to her in a minute with a shock of wonder that forbade either pain or pleasure
and seemed to leave her numb. Now she saw how truly she, no less than the others, had treated
him as an outsider, as a tool, as something to be used, not as one of their own world. For
she had never thought of his falling in love with her, and had never considered him in that
point of view at all. Yet he had, and here lay the reason why he flirted no more, and why he
would have her sympathy only on even terms. Here also, it seemed, was the reason why his tricks
were forgotten, why he was simple and direct; here was the incitement to imagination, the ideal,
the passion that had power to fire and purge his soul.

"We must go in," she whispered in a shaking voice. "We must go in, Mr. Quisanté."

                             CHAPTER VI.

                            ON DUTY HILL.

Another week had gone by, and, although nothing very palpable had happened, there was a sort
of vague scare in the house-party. It touched everybody, affecting them in different ways according
to their characters, but raising in all an indignant protest against a fact hardly credible
and a danger scarcely to be named. Not even Mrs. Baxter, entrenched in placidity and petticoats,
quite escaped its influence; even Morewood's cynical humour hesitated to play on a situation
so unexpected, possibly so serious. Lady Richard's alarm was the most outspoken, and her dismay
the most clamorous; yet perhaps in Dick Benyon himself was the strongest fear. For if that
did happen which seemed to be happening beneath the incredulous gaze of their eyes, who but
he was responsible, to whose account save his could the result be laid? He had brought the
man into the circle, into the house, into the knowledge of his friends; but for him Quisanté
might have been carving a career far away, or have given up any idea of one at all.

More than this, Dick, seeking approval and sympathy, had looked round for open and intelligent
souls who would share his interest, his hopes, and his enthusiasm, and on no soul had he spent
more pains or built higher anticipations than May Gaston's. She was to sympathise, to share
the hopes and to understand the enthusiasm. Had he not asked her to dinner, had he not brought
her to the Imperial League banquet, had he not incited Lady Richard to have her at Ashwood?
And now she spread this scare through the house; she outran the limits--all the reasonable
limits--of interest, she did far more than ever he had asked of her, she cast reflections on
his judgment by pushing it to extremes whither it had never been meant to stretch. She had
been bidden to watch Alexander Quisanté, to admire his great moments, to see a future for him,
and to applaud the discerning eye which had seen that future first. But who had bidden her
make a friend of the man, take him into the inner circle, treat him as one who belonged to
the group of her intimates, to the company of her equals and of those with whom she had grown
up? Almost passionately Dick disclaimed the responsibility for this; with no less heat his
wife forced it on him; relentlessly the course of events seemed to charge him with it.

What would happen he did not know; none of them at Ashwood professed to know; they refused
to forecast the worst. But what had actually happened was that Quisanté was undoubtedly in
love with May Gaston, and that May Gaston was no less certainly wrapped up in Quisanté. The
difference of terms was fondly clung to; and indeed she showed no signs of love as love is
generally understood; she displayed only an open preference for his society and an engrossed
interest in him. It was bad enough; who could tell when it might become worse? "I will buy
with you, sell with you, talk with you, walk with you, and so following; but I will not eat
with you, drink with you, nor pray with you." Allowing for difference of times and customs,
that had been the attitude of all towards Quisanté; a caste-feeling, almost a race-feeling,
dictated it and kept it alive and strong under all superficial alliance and outward friendliness.
But May had seen the barrier only to throw it down in a passion of scorn for its narrowness
and an impulse of indignation at its cruelty. If she had gone so far, he was bold who dared
to say that she would not go farther, or would set a limit to her advance on the path that
the rest of them had never trodden.

"At any rate it shan't happen here," said Lady Richard. "I should never be able to look her
mother in the face again."

"It won't happen anywhere," Dick protested. "But you can't turn him out, you know."

"I can't unless I absolutely literally do. He won't see that he isn't wanted."

"No; and he may be excused if he thinks he is--by May Gaston at all events."

The subject was one to be discussed between husbands and wives, Dick and Lady Richard, Mrs.
Baxter and the Dean, rather than in any more public fashion, but the unexpressed thought pervaded
every conversation, and was strongest when the presence of the persons concerned forbade even
indirect reference. Once or twice Morewood broke into open comment to Lady Richard; he puzzled
her rather, and did not console her at all.

"I know why you object and how silly your grounds are," he said. "It's snobbery in you, you
know. Now in me it's good sound sense. Because in the first place, if I were ten years younger,
and ten times richer, and rather more of a man, I should like to marry her myself; and in the
second place I'm not sure Quisanté hasn't forged, or isn't about to forge, a cheque for a million."

"Don't talk about it," shuddered little Lady Richard. "She can't care for him, she can't, you
know."

"Certainly not, in the sentimental sense that you women attach to that very weak form of expression."

"And I'm sure there's nothing else to tempt her."

"You'll be laying down what does and doesn't tempt me next."

"I've known her since she was a child."

"There's nothing that produces so many false judgments of people."

Lady Richard was far too prostrate to accept any challenge.

"You do hate it as much as I do, don't you?" she implored.

"Quite," said he with restrained intensity. "But if you ask me, I think she'll do it."

A pause followed. "Fred Wentworth must have been waiting ever so long for me," Lady Richard
murmured apologetically, though an apology to Morewood could not soothe Fred. Her thoughts
were busy, and a resolve was forming in her mind. "I shall ask Mrs. Baxter to speak to her,"
she announced at last.

"That'll be amusing if it's nothing else. I should like to be there."

Mrs. Baxter was by no means unwilling to help. She was mother to a large family and had seen
all her children creditably married; such matters lay well within the sphere of legitimate
feminine activity as she conceived it. Of course the Dean told her she had better leave the
thing alone, but it was evident that this was no more than a disclaimer of responsibility in
case her efforts did more harm than good.

Mrs. Baxter advanced on approved and traditional lines. She slid into the special topic from
a general survey of matrimonial desirability; May did not shy, but seemed ready to listen.
Mrs. Baxter ignored the possibility of any serious purpose on May's side and pointed out with
motherly gentleness that her impulsive interest in Quisanté might possibly be misunderstood
by him and give rise to an idea absolutely remote from any which it was May's intention to
arouse. Then she would give pain; wouldn't it be better gradually, not roughly or rudely but
by slow degrees, to diminish the time she spent with Quisanté and the attention she bestowed
on him? Mrs. Baxter's remonstrance, if somewhat conventional, yet was artistic in its way.

But May Gaston laughed; it was all very familiar, sounded very old, and was ludicrously wide
of the mark. She had not been careless, she had not suffered from the dangerous stupidity of
ultra-maidenly blindness, she knew quite well how Quisanté felt. Accordingly she would not
acquiesce in Mrs. Baxter's diplomatic ignoring of the only material point--how she felt herself.
Of course if all Mrs. Baxter meant to convey was her own disapproval of the idea,--well, she
conveyed so much. But then nobody needed to be told of that; it was quite obvious and it was
not important; it was an insignificant atom in the great inevitable mass of disapproval which
any marked liking for Quisanté (May shrank from even thinking of stronger terms) must arouse.
She had far too much understanding of the disapproval and far too much sympathy with it to
underrate the probable extent and depth of it; to a half of herself she was with it, heart
and soul; to a half of herself the impulse that drove her towards Quisanté was something hardly
rational and wholly repulsive. What purpose, then, did Mrs. Baxter's traditional motherliness
serve?

There was one person with whom she wished to talk, who might, she thought, help her to understand
herself and thus to guide her steps. For every day it became more and more obvious that the
matter would have to be faced and ended one way or the other. Quisanté was not patient, and
he would not be dealt with by way of favour. And she herself was in a turmoil and a contradiction
of feeling which she summed up antithetically by declaring that she disliked him more every
hour he was there and missed him more every hour he was not; or, to adopt the Dean's metaphor,
his presence set her teeth on edge and his absence made her feel as if she had nothing to eat.
Morewood might help her; he would at least understand something of how she felt, if she could
summon up courage to talk to him; they were old friends.

One afternoon Quisanté had been sitting with them on the lawn and, going off to walk with Dick,
left them alone together. "his lordship who had to comprehend that we reconcile there that his grandma'head
delaware bonis non; and hardly, my matters, oh him does affect me that you would be a situation

"Possibly Mrs. Baxter only perceives the wretched underwood."

"Inevitably," said May.

"For heaven's sake don't drift into thinking that you're the only person who can understand
him. Once think that about anybody and you're his slave."

"Perhaps I'm the only person who takes the trouble. I don't claim genius, only diligence."

"Well, you're very diligent," Morewood grunted.

She sat looking straight in front of her for a few moments in silence, while Morewood admired
the curve of her chin and the moulding of her throat.

"I feel," she said in a low voice and slowly, "as if I must see what becomes of him and as
if it ought to be seen at close quarters."

Then Morewood spoke with deliberate plainness.

"You know better than I do that he's not of your class; I mean in himself, not merely where
he happens to come from. And for my part I'm not sure that he's an honest man, and I don't
think he's a high-minded one."

"Do you believe people are bound to be always just what they are now?" she asked.

"Thinking you can improve them is the one thing more dangerous to yourself than thinking you've
a special gift for understanding them. To be quite plain, both generally end in love-affairs
and, what's more, unhappy love-affairs."

"Oh, I'm not in love with Mr. Quisanté. You're going back to your narrow loving-hating theory."

"Hum. I'm inclined to think that nature shares my narrowness."

If May got small comfort from this conversation, Morewood got less, and the rest of the party,
judging from what he let drop about his impressions of May's state of mind, none at all. Lady
Richard was of opinion that a crisis approached and re-echoed her cry, "Not here anyhow!" But
Quisanté's demeanour at once confirmed her fears and ignored her protest. He had many faults
and weaknesses, but he was not the man to shrink from a big stake and a great throw. His confidence
in his powers was the higher owing to his blindness to his defects. May Gaston had indeed opened
his eyes to some degree, but here again, as she showed him continued favour, he found good
excuse for dwelling on the interest which inspired rather than on the frankness which characterised
her utterance. She had bidden him be himself; then to her that was a thing worth being. As
he believed himself able to conquer all external obstacles in his path, so he vaguely supposed
that he could overcome and obliterate anything there might be wrong in himself, or at any rate
that he could so outweigh it by a more prodigal display of his gifts as to reduce it to utter
insignificance; try as he might to see him self as she saw him, he could not fully understand
the gravity of her objections. And anyhow, grave as she thought them, she was his friend; at
the cost of defying, perhaps of losing, her friends, she elected to be his friend.

To the appeal of this generosity his emotions responded passionately; now he worshipped his
Empress among women for more than her grace, her stateliness, or her beauty; he loved her for
her courage and her loyalty. There seemed nothing that he would not do for her; it did not,
however, occur to him that perhaps the one thing he could do for her was to leave her. But
short of this self-sacrifice--and to that even he might have risen had anyone pointed him the
way--he was in just that state of exalted feeling which made him at his best, cured him of
his tricks for the time being, and gave him the simplicity whose absence marred his ordinary
hours. He always rose to the occasion, Dick Benyon maintained; and to this great occasion he
came marvellously near to rising. This is not to say that he was altogether in the temper of
a hero of romance. He loved the lady, but he loved the victory too, the report of it, the éclat,
the talk it would make.

The tendency of events might seem to justify his growing hopes and almost to excuse confidence,
but May's mood, had he seen it fully, would have rebuked him. She hung doubtful. She had succeeded,
by the help of her far-fetched metaphors, in describing to Morewood the nature of the attraction
which Quisanté exercised over her and of the force which drew her on; but to Morewood she had
said nothing of the opposing influences. She had sent no letter to Marchmont, she had not yet
refused to become his wife. Although she recognised the unfairness of this treatment of him
she could not compel her hand to the writing of the letter; for Marchmont came to personify
to her all that she lost, that at least she risked, if she yielded to her new impulse. Thus
the hold which her liking for him, their old acquaintance, and all the obvious advantages gave
him was further strengthened. Leaving on one side his position and the excellence of the match,
things which now seemed to her less important, and coming to the more intimate and personal
aspect of the matter, she realised with a pang how much Marchmont pleased her; he never offended
her taste or jarred on her feelings; she would be absolutely safe with him, he would gratify
almost every mood and satisfy almost every aspiration.

Dealing very plainly with herself, formulating the question that she could not put to Morewood,
she asked whether she would not rather go as a wife to Marchmont than to any other man she
had met, whether Quisanté or another. She had been, perhaps still was, more nearly in love
with Weston Marchmont than with anybody else. But the "almosts" were obstinate; the nearly
had never become the quite; she did not tell herself that it never could; on the contrary she
recognised (though here she was inclined to shirk the probe) that if she married another, she
might well awake to find herself loving Marchmont; she knew that she would not like Marchmont
to love another woman. So far she carried her inquiry: then she grew in a way sick and disgusted
with this exposure of her inmost feelings. She would not proceed to ask why precisely she could
not say yes to Marchmont without being sensible of a loss greater than the gain. All she knew
was that she would not think of becoming Quisanté's wife if that were not the only way of getting
all she wanted from Quisanté. The wifehood she looked on as a means to something else, to what
she could hardly say; in itself she did not desire it.

Lady Richard's prayer was answered--no thanks to herself or her hints, no thanks either to
Mrs. Baxter's motherly remonstrance or to Morewood's blunt speech. It was May herself who sent
Quisanté away. A thrill of relief ran round the table when he announced at dinner that if Lady
Richard would excuse him he would leave by the early train. Excuse him! She would have hired
a balloon to take him if he had declared a preference for that form of locomotion. But she
expressed the proper regret and the proper interest in the reason (the pretext she called it
in her own mind) for his departure. It appeared that a very large and important Meeting was
to be held at Manchester; two Cabinet ministers were to be there; Quisanté was invited to be
the third speaker. He explained that he felt it would be a mistake to refuse the invitation,
and the acceptance of it entailed a quiet day or two in London with his Blue-books and his
papers. As he put it, the whole thing sounded like an excuse; Lady Richard hoped that it covered
a retreat and that the retreat was after a decisive repulse from May Gaston. Even Dick was
half inclined to share this opinion; for although he knew how a chance of shining with, and
perhaps of outshining, such luminaries as were to adorn the Manchester platform would appeal
to his friend, he did not think that for its sake Quisanté would abandon any prospect of success
in his suit. In fact the impression was general, and the relief proportionate. The Dean beamed
and Mrs. Baxter purred; Morewood was good-natured, and Fred Wentworth was lightened of a burden
of bewilderment which had pressed heavily on his youthful mind. Quisanté was treated with a
marked access of cordiality, and May was petted like a child who has displayed a strong inclination
to be naughty, but has at last made up its mind to be good, and thereby saved those responsible
for its moral welfare from the disagreeable necessity of showing displeasure and exercising
discipline. She smiled to herself at the effusive affection with which Lady Richard bade her
good-night.

For these people did not know the history, and had not been present at the interview between
May and Quisanté on Duty Hill when the sun was sinking and the air was still. They did not
know that it was by her command that he went and that his going rather strengthened than relaxed
the bond there was between them. Always there stood out in her memory the scene on the hill,
how he faced her there and told her that, great as the chance was and imperative as the call,
yet he would not go; he could not leave her, he said, and then and there poured out his love
for her. When he made love, he was not as when he flirted. Passion purged him; he was strong,
direct, and simple; he was consumed then by what he felt and had no time to spoil the effect
by asking what impression he made on others. Here was the thing that Marchmont could not give
her, the great moment, the thrill, the sense of a power in the man which she had not measured,
might spend her life in seeking to measure, and yet never to the end know in its fulness. But
she answered not a word to his love-making, she neither accepted nor refused it; as often as
he paused an instant and again when he came to the end, she had nothing to say or would say
nothing except, "You must go."

"You're the only person in the world for whose sake I would hesitate about going."

She smiled. "That's not at all to your credit," she said; but she was not ill pleased.

He came a step nearer to her and said, still soberly, still quietly, "I'll go away from here
to-morrow."

"Yes, to the meeting," she said, looking up at him brightly from her seat on the wooden bench
on the hill-top.

"Away from here," he repeated. "But not to the meeting unless you send me." Then he stood quite
still opposite to her for a minute. "Because unless you care for me to do it, I don't care
to do it," he went on.

A long silence followed as she sat there, looking past him down into the rich valley that spread
from the foot of the hill. The fascination was strong on her, the fear was strong on her too;
but for the moment the repulsion was forgotten. For he had risen to the occasion, as Dick Benyon
maintained that he always did; not a word too much, not an entreaty too extravagant, not an
epithet too florid had found passage from his lips. His instinct of the way to treat a great
and important situation had saved him and brought him triumphantly through all the perils.
He did not ignore what he was, he did not disguise his knowledge of his powers; knowing what
they were and the value of his offering, he laid them all at her feet and asked in return no
more than her leave and her command to use them.

She raised her eyes to his pale eager face.

"I send you then," she said. "And now walk with me down the hill and tell me what you'll say
at Manchester."

That night, before she went to bed, she wrote to Weston Marchmont;

    "Dear Friend,--I will not wait to see you again. I can't do what you
    wish. Everything else I could do for you, and everything else that
    you wish I wish for you. But I can't do that."

Alas for the renewed peace of Lady Richard's mind, alas for the returning quiet of Dick Benyon's
conscience! Quisanté made his preparations for going with his eyes all agleam, murmuring again
and again, "She sends me; she shall see what I'm worth." For one of his great moments had come
in the nick of time and done a work that he himself, low as he might now and again fall, could
hardly quite undo.

                             CHAPTER VII.

                        ADVICE FROM AUNT MARIA.

The two Cabinet Ministers brought back from Manchester different accounts of Quisanté's speech
and its effects. One said it was frothy rhetoric heard in puzzled lethargy, the other that
it was genuine eloquence received with the hush of profound attention, but hailed at the end
with rapturous enthusiasm. This was a typical case of the division of opinion which began to
prevail about Quisanté, and was not disposed of by observing that the unfavourable Minister
belonged to that "old gang" which it was Quisanté's mission to shake up or shake out. Rich
in merits, his speeches were nevertheless faulty to a critical ear; the ornate was apt to turn
to the gaudy, the dignified to the pompous. To the critical, defects outweigh merits; but the
mass of people, not being critical, fix on the fine things, contentedly and perhaps not unwisely
ignoring the blemishes. So the speech was a great popular success, and Alexander Quisanté conceived
that he had more than justified his reputation and had ornamented his Lady's colours with the
laurel of victory. He wrote to her to say that he was staying a few days in Lancashire and
had arranged to speak at one or two other places. "If I do at all well," he wrote, "it is because
I forget my audience and think that I speak only to you and to earn the praise of your eyes."

"Oh, dear, why does he talk like that?" said May Gaston with a sigh and a smile. "Forget his
audience! The praise of my eyes!" She read the compliment over again almost despairingly. "Yet
he doesn't really think me an idiot," she ended. She had made up her mind to forgive him his
habit of playing to the gallery, but he need not treat her as though she sat there. She felt
able to understand the dumb and bewildered reproach which fronted her in her sister Fanny's
face, but found spoken expression only in the news that Fanny had had a letter from Lady Richard.

The next day she went to see Miss Quisanté; the paying of this visit had been in her mind from
the first moment she left Ashwood. In the little flat's narrow passage she had to squeeze by
a short, stout, dark man, dressed with much elaboration; Miss Quisanté explained afterwards
that he was a sort of cousin of her own and Sandro's.

"His name is Mandeville," she said. "His father's was Isaacs. You knew we had Jewish relations?"

"I thought it not improbable."

"I suppose we've got some of the blood, and some of it's a very good thing," pursued Aunt Maria.
"This man's a stock-jobber; he came to talk to me about my money, but he let out a thing or
two about Sandro."

"About Mr. Quisanté?"

"Yes. Well, I'm not surprised; I never am surprised at Sandro. Only if he speculates with my
money I shan't give it him."

May listened and heard how Quisanté had embarked the five hundred pounds given him to support
his new position in a hazardous, although not unpromising, speculation. Whether he would win
or lose was still uncertain; Mandeville had hopes.

"And I don't know that it's exactly dishonest," said Aunt Maria meditatively. "But that's just
like Sandro. He's always doing things that you can't be quite sure about--whether they're straight
or not, you know. He was just the same as a boy."

May had a sense of treachery in listening, but how should she not listen? Morewood's opinion
came into her memory. Miss Quisanté was confirming it out of her full acquaintance with its
subject.

"I gave him the money, it was his own, I've got nothing to show," said Miss Quisanté with her
vinegary little smile.

"Perhaps he--he misunderstood what you meant; I mean, that you intended the money for any special
purpose."

"That's exactly what he'll say," remarked Aunt Maria with a triumphant nod.

"But if it's true----"

"I shan't know whether it's true or not. That's where Sandro's cleverness comes in."

It was hard to realise that the old lady talked of the man whom her hearer had seen on Duty Hill.

"I'm sure you don't do him justice." The plea sounded weak even to its utterer.

"To an ounce," said Aunt Maria emphatically. May laughed. "I lived with him for twelve years,
and I'm not a fool any more than he is. If you ask him about me, you'll get the truth, and
you get it when you ask me about him. After twelve years I ought to know."

"You've read his speech?" May asked. "Isn't it magnificent, parts of it anyhow?"

"Very few men have a brain like Sandro's."

"There I agree with you, Miss Quisanté." But May's face was troubled as she added, a moment
later, "He ought to give you back your money, though."

"He will, if he makes a lot out of it, and he'll give me a nice present too. Then he'll feel
that he's acted quite properly all through. And if he loses it--well, as I say, he's got his
case, and I can't prove anything."

"Men like him are often careless about money affairs. It's only that, I expect."

"Careless! Sandro careless! Oh, dear me, no." and for once Miss Quisanté laughed heartily.
The beads on her cap shook as her dumpy little form swayed gently with mirth; she looked impishly
delighted at such a misconception of her nephew's character. May felt very foolish, but could
not help laughing herself.

"Well, I won't plead his cause any more," she said. "Only I believe you're prejudiced." She
paused, and then, looking the old woman in the face, added, "I ought to tell you that he and
I have become great friends."

Miss Quisanté had stopped laughing; now she made a gesture which seemed to indicate that she
washed her hands of any responsibility. But she appeared fretful and disturbed.

"I'm immensely impressed by him; and I think these faults you talk so much about are only superficial.
They can't really belong to his nature when so much that's fine does." Her voice shook a little
as she implored a merciful judgment from the relentless old lady. Aunt Maria's shrewd eyes
grew softer.

"I used to say that to myself for ever so long," she said. "I catch myself saying it now and
then even now."

"You're disappointed at not--not getting on better with him, and it makes you bitter."

"And you? You get on very well with him?"

"I don't think I'm blind about him. I see what you mean and what a lot of people feel. If there
is a pit, I've walked into it open-eyed."

"He's in love with you, of course?"

A denial was hardly worth while and quite useless. "You must ask him that, Miss Quisanté,"
May replied. Aunt Maria nodded and gazed at her long and steadily.

"Yes, you're his Empress among women," she said at last with a little sneer. "Sandro has a
phrase for everything and everybody. And are you in love with him?"

May had wanted to come to close quarters and was glad that Aunt Maria gave her a lead. But
she did not return a direct answer to the question.

"You wouldn't be encouraging, if I were thinking of becoming his wife."

"It would be very extraordinary that you should."

"I've no particular desire to be ordinary," said May, smiling.

Miss Quisanté leant forward suddenly and held up a short forefinger.

"My dear, you'd be very unhappy," she said. Then she leant back again and received in complete
stillness May's meditative gaze.

"In a good many ways perhaps I should," said May at last with a sigh, and her brow puckered
with wrinkles. "Yes, I suppose so," she sighed again.

"But I know what it is. You've let yourself get interested in Sandro; you've let him lay hold
of you." May nodded. "And it would seem rather dull now to lose him?" Again May nodded, laughing
a little. Aunt Maria understood her feelings very well, it seemed. "I should be dull too if
I lost him." The old lady folded her hands in her lap. "There is that about Sandro," she said
with a touch of pride in her voice. "I don't like him; well, you've gathered that perhaps;
but if anything happened to him, I should feel I might as well lie down and die. Of course
I've got nobody else belonging to me; you're not like that." Again the forefinger was raised
in admonition, and Miss Quisanté gave a piece of practical advice. "Marry a nice man of your
own sort, my dear, and when you're safely married, be as much interested in Sandro as you like."

May was not quite sure of the morality of this counsel; it seemed possible that Aunt Maria
shared the vagueness about right and wrong which she quarrelled with in her nephew. She laughed
as she said,

"But then Mr. Quisanté would marry some other woman, and she mightn't like it. And my nice
husband mightn't like it."

It was possible to discuss the matter far more frankly with Miss Quisanté than with anybody
else, yet the talk with her was only the first of several in which May tried to glean what
would be thought of such a step as marrying Alexander Quisanté. Almost everywhere she found,
not only the lack of encouragement which Aunt Maria had shown, but an amazement hardly distinguishable
from horror and an utter failure to understand her point of view; her care to conceal any personal
interest in the discussions she found means to bring about gained her very candid expressions
of opinion about Quisanté, and she became aware that her world would regard her as something
like a lunatic if it awoke one morning to read of her engagement to the man.

Yet side by side with this feeling there was a great and a growing expectancy with regard to
him in his public aspect. He began to be a figure, somebody of whom account would have to be
taken; Dick Benyon's infatuation was less often mentioned, his sagacity more often praised.
May was struck again with the sharp line drawn between the man himself, and what he was to
do, with the way in which everybody proposed to invite him to his house, but nobody contemplated
admitting him to his heart. The inhumanity made her angry again, but she was alone in perceiving
it; and she was half-aware that her perception of it would be far keener than Quisanté's own.
In fact it was very doubtful if he asked any more of the world than what the world was prepared
to give him. But that, said May, was not because he lacked the power and the desire of love,
but because his affections were withered by neglect or rusty from disuse. She knew well that
they were there and would expand under the influence of sympathy. If people grew human towards
him, he would respond in kind; in hitting on this idea she commended herself for a sagacity
in questions of emotion not less than that which Dick Benyon had shown in matters of the intellect.
Dick had discovered Quisanté, as he thought; May told herself that he had discovered only half
of Quisanté, and that the other half had been left for her to explore, and to reveal to the
world. The effect of her various conversations was rather to confirm her in her inclination
towards Quisanté than to frighten her out of it.

There was one talk which she could not escape and had to face with what resolution she might.
Weston Marchmont was not content with the brief dismissal which had reached him from Ashwood,
and he was amazed beyond understanding at the hint of its cause which Dick Benyon had given
him. He had no doubt some reason to think himself ill-used, but he was not inclined to press
that side of the case. It was not his own failure so much as the threatened success of such
a rival that staggered and horrified him. Few are wide-minded enough to feel a friendship quite
untouched and unimpaired when their friend takes into equal intimacy a third person for whom
they themselves entertain aversion or contempt; at the best they see in such conduct an unexpected
failure of discernment; very often they detect in it evidence of a startling coarseness of
feeling, an insensibility, and a grossness of taste difficult to tolerate in one to whom they
have given their affection. Marchmont felt that, if May Gaston wronged him, she was wronging
far more herself, and most of all his ideal of her. He could not believe such a thing of her
without her own plain assurance, and would not suffer it until every effort to redeem and rescue
her was exhausted.

"You don't mean," he said at last openly and bluntly to Dick Benyon, "that you think it's possible
she'll marry him?"

"I do, quite," groaned poor Dick. "You can imagine how I feel about it; and if I didn't see
it myself, Amy would soon let me know it."

Marchmont said no more, feeling that discussion was difficult for one in his position, but
Dick did not spare him a description of what had happened at Ashwood, from which he realised
the gravity of the danger.

"After all, he's a very remarkable man," Dick pleaded, in a forlorn effort at defending himself
no less than the lady.

The audacity of the man, the headlong folly of the girl, the hopeless mixing of incompatibles
were common to the two cases; the issue of the earlier clearly indicated the fate that must
attend the later. Lady Richard could do nothing but gasp out, "And what happened, Mrs. Baxter?"

Mrs. Baxter told her, punctuating the story with stitches on a June petticoat.

"She ran away from him twice; but he brought her back, and, they said, beat her well. At any
rate she ended by settling down to her new life. They had seven children, all brought up to
the circus; only the other day one was sent to prison for ill-treating the dancing bear. He's
dead, but she still keeps the circus under his name. Of course all her old friends have dropped
her; indeed I hear she drinks. Her father still preaches once on Sundays."

It was easy to disentangle the relevant from the merely reminiscent; the running away, the
beating, the settling down, the complete absorption in the new life (vividly indicated by the
seven children and their habits), stood out saliently. Add the attitude of old friends, and
Lady Richard could not deny the value of the parallel. She acknowledged it with a long-drawn sigh.

"May Gaston must be mad," she observed. "You can imagine how Dick feels about it!"

"And all the while her cousin in the Bank was quite ready to marry her and give her a nice
little home. He was Church and sang in the choir at St. Dunstan's."

Without consciously appreciating the nicety of the parallel here, Lady Richard began to think
of Weston Marchmont.

"I suppose Mr. Marchmont'll take Fanny now," she said. "I don't know, though; he won't like
any sort of connection with Alexander Quisanté. How selfish people are! They never think of
what their marriages mean to their relations."

This observation expressed a large part of what was felt by society; add friends to relations,
and it summed up one side of the indictment against May Gaston. Lady Attlebridge's helpless
and bewildered woe was one instance of its truth, Fanny's rage another; to look farther afield,
May's friends and acquaintances discovered great cause for vexation in that they saw themselves
somehow "let in for" Quisanté. At least the alternative was to drop May Gaston as entirely
as the unfortunate circus proprietor's wife had been dropped; and this alternative was a difficult
one. Had Quisanté's raid resulted in the seizure of some insignificant colourless girl who
had been merely tolerated for the sake of who she was without possessing any claims in respect
of what she was, the dropping would have been easy; but May was not of that kind. She was not
only one of them, but very conspicuous among them, one of their ornaments, one in whom they
took pride; they would have acknowledged in her a natural leader so soon as a suitable marriage
gave her the necessary status and experience. Her treachery was the more flagrant, Quisanté's
presumption the more enormous, their own course of action the more puzzling to decide.

Yet in their hearts they knew that they must swallow the man; events were too strong for them.
Dick Benyon had forced him on them in one side of life, May Gaston now did the like in another;
henceforward he must be and would be among them. This consciousness mingled an ingredient of
asperity with their genuine pity for May. She would not merely have herself to thank for the
troubles which would certainly come upon her; her misfortunes must be regarded as in part a
proper punishment for the annoyance she was inflicting on her friends. As for Dick Benyon,
it was impossible to speak to him without perceiving that if remorse be in truth the sharpest
penalty of sin, he was already punished enough.

The poor man's state was indeed such as to move compassion. Besides his old friend Lady Attlebridge's
dumbly accusing eyes, besides Fanny's and Lady Richard's by no means dumb reproaches, a very
heavy blow had fallen on him. In the words of his own complaint, his brother Jimmy had gone
back on him--and back on his allegiance to Alexander Quisanté. The engagement was too much
for Jimmy, and in the revulsion of feeling he became downright hostile to Quisanté's claims
and pretensions. How could he not when Fanny Gaston imperiously and almost tearfully commanded
him to attach himself to her banner, and to behold with her eyes the indignity suffered by
the noble family of Gaston? Logic was not Jimmy's strong point, and he confounded poor Dick
by the twofold assertion that the thing was utterly incredible, and that Dick and he had been
most inconceivably idiotic not to have foreseen it from the first hour that they took up Quisanté.
In this stress of feeling the brothers spoke to one another with candour.

"You know how I feel about Fanny," said Jimmy, "so you can imagine how much I like it."

"Oh, yes, I know; and I quite understand that you wanted Marchmont to marry May," Dick retorted
in an alien savageness born of his wounded spirit.

Jimmy was taken aback by this direct onslaught, but his native honesty forbade him to deny
the charge point-blank.

"Supposing she came to like me," he grumbled, "it wouldn't be over and above pleasant to have
Quisanté for a brother-in-law."

Dick was roused; he summoned up his old faith and his old admiration.

"I tell you what," he said, "the only chance you have of your name being known to posterity
is if you succeed in becoming his brother-in-law."

"Damn posterity," said Jimmy, tugging at his moustache. He had never entertained the absurd
idea of interesting future ages. He began to perceive more and more clearly how ridiculous
his brother had made himself over the fellow; he had shared in the folly, but now at least
he could repent and dissociate himself from it.

"What does the Dean say?" he asked maliciously.

"I dare say you won't understand," Dick answered in measured tones, "but the Dean's got sense
enough to say nothing. Talking's no use, is it?"

Few indeed shared the Dean's wisdom, or the somewhat limited view that talking is only to be
practised when it chances to be useful. Are we never to discuss the obvious or to deplore the
inevitable? From so stern a code human nature revolts, and the storm of volubility went on
in spite of the silence of the Dean of St. Neot's. Even this silence was imperfect in so far
as the Dean said a word or two in private to Morewood when he visited him in his studio, and
the pair were looking at Quisanté's picture. Dick Benyon was less anxious now to have it finished
and sent home in the shortest possible time.

"You've seen some good in him," said the Dean, pointing to the picture.

"Well--something anyhow," said Morewood.

"I think, you know," the Dean pursued meditatively, "that a great woman might succeed in what
she's undertaken (Morewood did not need the mention of May Gaston's name), at the cost of sacrificing
all her other interests and most of her feelings."

Morewood was lighting his pipe and made no answer.

"Is our dear young friend a great woman, though?" asked the Dean.

"She aspires to be," said Morewood; he was sneering as usual, but rather at aspirations in
general than at any unusual absurdity in May Gaston's; thus at least the Dean understood him.

"You mean that that's at the bottom of the trouble?" he inquired, smiling a little.

"Oh, yes," answered Morewood, weary of indicating what was so apparent.

"You've dived down to something in that picture; perhaps she has."

"Yes, she has." Morewood looked straight at the Dean as he added, "But I can leave out the
other things, you see. That's the difference."

"And she can't? No. That is the difference. She'll have to live with the other things." He
looked courageously at Morewood and ended, "We must trust in God." Either the sincerity or
the unexpectedness of the remark kept Morewood silent.

No such ambition as these two imputed to her consciously animated May Gaston. Just now she
was content if she could persuade her mother that people after all said nothing very dreadful
(for what was said was always more to Lady Attlebridge than what was true), could keep on something
like friendly relations with her sister, and could maintain a cheerful view of her own position
and of her experiment. Inevitably the hostility of his future mother-in-law and of Fanny brought
out the worst side of Quisanté's manners; in the effort to conciliate he almost fawned. May
had to find consolation in a growth of openness and simplicity towards herself. And she had
one notable triumph which more than anything else brought her through the trial with her purpose
unshaken and her faith even a little strengthened. It was not a complete triumph, and in trying
to push it too far she suffered a slight rebuff; but there was hope to be had from it, it seemed
to open a prospect of successes more ample. She made Quisanté send back Aunt Maria's five hundred
pounds before Mr. Mandeville's operations had resulted either in safety or in gain.

"You see, she never gave it you to use in speculation," she had said. "It isn't right, you
must see it isn't. Have you got the money?"

"Yes; but I meant to buy you----"

"No, no, I wouldn't have it. Now do send it back. I know you see what I mean." Her voice grew
doubtful and imploring.

"Oh, yes, in a way. But I shan't lose it, you know."

"That doesn't make the least difference."

"If it pleases you, I'll send it back."

"Well, do," she said with a little sigh. The motive was not that which she wished to rouse,
but very likely it was that with which she must begin her work. Then she tried the further
step. "And any profit you make, if you make any, you ought to send too," she said.

Genuine surprise was exhibited on Quisanté's face. "What, after sending back the five hundred?"
he asked.

"Yes, you ought." She made a little concession by adding, "Strictly, you know." Quisanté looked
at her, kissed her hand, and laughed. Her sense of humour, which she began to perceive would
rather hamper her, made her join in the laugh. "Do you think me very absurd? No, no, not compliments!
Truth, truth always!"

"I call the suggestion rather--well, rather fanciful," said he.

"Yes, I suppose you do," she sighed. "Do you know what I hope?" she went on. "I hope that some
day that sort of suggestion will seem a matter of course to you."

He stopped laughing and looked put out. She saw that his vanity was hurt. "But I hope all sorts
of unusual things about you," she went on, her conscience rebuking her for using the wile of
flattery. But it served well; the cloud passed from his face, as he begged her not to expect
to see him a saint too soon.

A few days later he came in radiant; the operation had gone splendidly, there was a cent. per
cent. profit; she was to come with him and buy the necklace at once. May loved necklaces and
liked him for being so eager to give her one. And she did not wish to appear in the light of
a prig (that had probably been his impression of her) again so soon. But had he not the evening
before, as they talked over their prospects, told her that he owed Dick Benyon a thousand pounds
or more, and was in arrears with the instalments by which the debt was to be liquidated? By
a not unnatural turn of her mind she found herself less able to allow him to forget his obligation,
less able to indulge him in the temporary extravagance of a lover, than if he had been a man
on whose punctilious honour in all matters of money she relied absolutely. She was more affectionate
and more effusive to him than usual, and it was with a kiss that she whispered,

"Give me the money, not the necklace."

"The money?" he said in surprise.

"Yes, to do what I like with. At least give me your promise to do what I ask with it."

He was suspicious and his face showed it. She laughed. "Yes, I'm worrying again," she said.
"I can now, you see. When we're married I shan't have the power."

"You'll always have absolute power over me."

"Oh, I wish that was true!" she said. "No, I don't," came an instant later. "If I thought that,
I'd never speak to you again." Moving away a little, she turned her head back towards him and
went on, "Use it to pay Dick Benyon. I'd rather you did that than gave me a thousand necklaces."

"Oh, Dick's in no hurry; he's got lots of money." Quisanté was visibly vexed this time. "Aren't
you going to allow me to give you anything?" he asked.

She had a struggle to win this time, and again had to call in the ally she distrusted, an appeal
to his vanity. She told him that it hurt her idea, her great idea, of him, that he should be
in any way under obligations to or dependent on anybody. This way of putting the matter caught
his fancy, which had remained blind to the more prosaic aspect of the case. "You must stand
by your own strength," she said. She had to go a step farther still. "It'll make Amy Benyon
quite angry too; it'll take away one of her grievances. Don't pay only the arrears, pay all
you can." Thus she won and was comforted, in spite of her suspicion of the weapons that she
found herself obliged to use.

Comfort she needed sadly, and it could come only from Quisanté himself. For the rest the sense
of loneliness was strong upon her, and with it a bitterness that this time in her life should
be so different from what it was in the lives of most girls. The superficials were there; friends
sent presents and Lady Attlebridge was as particular about the gowns and so forth as though
the match had been absolutely to her liking. But there was no sincere congratulation, no sympathy,
no envy. Her engagement was a mistake, her marriage a tragedy; that was the verdict; she saw
it in every glance and discerned it under every civil speech. The common judgment, the opinion
of the group we have lived with, has a force irrespective of its merit; there were times when
May sank under the burden of it and almost retreated. Then she was outwardly most contented,
took Quisanté everywhere with her, tried (as people said) to thrust him down everybody's throat,
even pretended a love which she had expressly denied to the man himself. All this done, she
would fly to solitude and there be a victim to her fears, shudder at the risk she had elected
to run, and pray for any strange convulsion of events to rescue her.

None came; time went on, people settled down to the notion; only to a small circle the matter
retained a predominant interest. The rest of the world could not go on talking about it for
ever; they had a number of other people's affairs to attend to, and the vagaries of one fanciful
young woman could not occupy their important minds for ever. None the less, they turned away
with a pleasant sense that they might find good reason for turning back presently; let a year
or two of the marriage run, and there might be something to look at again.

But to one man the thing never became less strange, less engrossing, or less horrible. Weston
Marchmont abandoned as pure folly the attempt to accustom his mind to it or to acquiesce in
it; he had not the power to cease to think of it. It was unnatural; to that he returned always;
and it ousted what surely was natural, what his whole being cried out was meant, if there were
such a thing as a purpose in human lives at all. Disguised by his habit of self-repression
before others, his passion was as strong as Quisanté's own; it was backed by a harmony of tastes
and a similarity of training which gave it increased intensity; it had been encouraged by an
apparent promise of success, now turned to utter failure. Amy Benyon might think that he would
now marry Fanny, if only he could endure such an indirect connection with Quisanté. To himself
it seemed so impossible to think of anyone but May that in face of facts he could not believe
that he was not foremost in her heart. The facts meant marriage, it seemed; he denied that
they meant love. He discerned what May had said to Quisanté--although not of course that she
had said it--and it filled him with a more unendurable revolt. He might have tolerated a defeat
in love; not to be defeated and yet to suffer all the pains of the vanquished was not to be
borne. But he was helpless, and when he had tried to plead his cause he had done himself no
good. He had rather so conducted himself as to give May Gaston the right to shut the door on
any further friendship with him; towards her future husband he had never varied from an attitude
of cool disdain. It was more than a month since he had seen her, it was longer since he had
done more than nod carelessly to Quisanté as they passed one another in the lobby or the smoking-room.

Then one day, a fortnight before the marriage, he met Quisanté as they were both leaving the
House about four o'clock. On a sudden impulse he joined his rival. He knew his man; Quisanté
received him with friendliness and even effusion, and invited him to join him in a call at
Lady Attlebridge's. They went on together, Quisanté elated at this new evidence of his power
to reconcile opposition and conciliate support, Marchmont filled with a vague painful curiosity
and a desire to see the two together at the cost of any suffering the sight might bring him.

The drawing-room at Lady Attlebridge's was a double room; in one half May sat reading, in the
other her mother dozed. May rose with a start as the men entered together; her face flushed
as she greeted Marchmont and bade Quisanté go and pay his respects to her mother.

"I hardly expected ever to see you again," she said. "And I didn't expect Mr. Quisanté to bring
you." Her tone was oddly expressive at once of pleasure and regret, of anticipation and fear.
"Have you made friends?" she asked.

He answered under the impulse of his mood.

"We must make friends," he said, "or I shall never see any more of you."

"I thought you didn't want to." She liked him too well not to show a little coquetry, a little
challenge.

"I thought so too, or tried to think so."

"I was sure you had deserted me. You said such--well, such severe things."

"I say them all still."

"But here you are!" she cried, laughing.

"Yes, here I am," said he, but he was grave and looked intently at her. She grew red again
as she met his gaze, and frowned a little.

"I'm not sure I'm glad you've come after all," she said after a pause. "Why have you come?
I don't quite understand."

"I've come to see you, to look on at your happiness," he answered.

"You've no right to talk like that."

They became silent. From the inner room they heard Lady Attlebridge's nervous efforts at conversation
and Quisanté's fluent, too fluent, responses. He was telling the good lady about her great
social influence, and, little as she liked him, she seemed to listen eagerly. Marchmont looked
at May and smiled. He was disappointed when she returned his smile.

"He's a little too much of a politician, isn't he?" she asked.

Her refusal to perceive the insinuation of his smile made him ashamed of it.

"We all are, when we've something to get, I suppose," he said with a shrug.

"Oh, I don't think you need reproach yourself," she exclaimed, laughing.

There was a short pause. Then he said suddenly,

"You're the one person in the world to talk to."

Now she neither laughed nor yet rebuked him, and, as his eyes met hers, he seemed to have no
fear that she would do either the one or the other. Yet he could not quite understand her look;
did she pity him or did she entreat for herself? For his life he could not answer. The only
thing he knew was that she would follow her path and take for husband the man who flattered
Lady Attlebridge in the inner room. Then she spoke in a low voice.

"Yes, do come, come and see us afterwards, come as often as you like." He raised his eyes to
hers again. "Because the oftener you come, the more you'll understand him, and the better you
understand him, the better you'll know why I'm doing what I am."

The soft look of pity or of entreaty vanished from her eyes now. She seemed to speak in a strong
and even defiant confidence. But he met her with a resolute dissent.

"If you want me, I'll come. But I shan't understand why you did what you're doing and I shall
never see in him what you want me to see." He looked round and saw Quisanté preparing to join
them. "Am I to come, then?" he asked.

Quisanté was walking towards them; she answered with a nervous laugh, "I think you must come
sometimes anyhow." Then she raised her voice and said to Quisanté, "I'm telling Mr. Marchmont
that I shall expect to see him often at our house."

Quisanté seconded her invitation with more than adequate enthusiasm; if Marchmont were converted
to him, who could still be obstinate? The two men began to talk, May falling more and more
into silence. She did not accuse Marchmont of deliberate malice, but by chance or the freak
of some mischievous demon everything he said led Quisanté on to display his weaknesses. She
knew that Marchmont marked them every one; he was too well bred to show his consciousness by
so much as the most fleeting glance at her; yet she could have met such a glance with understanding,
yes, with sympathy, and would have had to summon up by artificial effort the resentment that
convention demanded of her. The sight of the two men brought home to her with a new and an
almost terrible sharpness the divorce between her emotional liking and her intellectual interest.
And in a matter which all experience declared to concern the emotions primarily, she had elected
to give foremost place to the intellect, to suffer under an ever recurring jar of the feelings
for the sake of an occasional treat to the brain. That was her prospect unless she could transform
the nature of Alexander Quisanté. "Marry a nice man of your own sort, and then be as much interested
as you like in Sandro." Aunt Maria's advice echoed in her ears as she watched the two men round
whom the struggle of her soul centred, the struggle that she had thought was finished on the
day when she promised to become Alexander Quisanté's wife.

"I shall keep you both to your word," said Marchmont when he left them. May nodded, smiling
slightly. Quisanté said all and more than all the proper things.

                             CHAPTER IX.

                             LEAD US NOT.

After a long sojourn in kindlier climates, Miss Quisanté returned to England some eighteen
months after May Gaston's marriage. From various hotels and boarding-houses she had watched
with an interested eye the progress of public affairs so far as they concerned her nephew.
She had seen how his name became more prominent and was more frequently mentioned, how the
hopes and fears about him grew, how he had gained glory by dashing sorties in defence of the
severely-pressed Government garrison; if the garrison decided (as rumour said they would) to
sally out and try fortune in the open field of a General Election, and proved victorious, it
could not be doubted that they would bestow a handsome reward on their gallant defender. Quisanté
bid fair to eclipse his rivals and to justify to the uttermost Dick Benyon's sagacity and enthusiasm.
The bitterness of the foe told the same story; unless a man is feared, he is not caricatured
in a comic paper in the guise of a juggler keeping three balls in the air at once, the said
balls being each of them legibly inscribed with one of the three words, "Gas--Gabble--Grab."
Such a straining of the usual amenity of controversy witnesses to grave apprehension. Miss
Quisanté in her pension at Florence smiled contentedly.

Of his private life her information had not been very ample. She had heard several times from
May, but May occupied her pen chiefly with her husband's political aims. She had heard once
from Sandro himself, when he informed her that his wife had borne him a daughter and that all
had gone very well indeed. Again Miss Quisanté smiled approvingly. She sent her love to May
and expressed to Sandro the hope that the baby would resemble its mother in appearance, constitution,
and disposition; the passage was a good example of that expressio unius which is a most emphatic
and unmistakable exclusio alterius. In the letter she enclosed a cheque for three hundred pounds;
the pensions were cheaper than the flat, and thus this service had become possible.

The Quisantés had taken a house in Grosvenor Road, near Westminster for Quisanté's convenience,
by the river, in obedience to his wife's choice. Here Miss Quisanté was welcomed by her nephew's
wife and shown her nephew's daughter. May watched the old lady's face as she perfunctorily
kissed and critically inspected the infant.

"Gaston!" said Aunt Maria at last; relief was clamorous in her tone.

"Yes, Miss Quisanté, Gaston, I think," said May, laughing.

The nurse admitted the predominance of Gaston, but with a professional keenness of eye began
to point out minor points in which the baby "favoured" her father.

"Nonsense, my good woman," snapped Aunt Maria. "The child's got two legs and two arms, I suppose,
as its father has, but that's all the likeness." Somewhat ruffled (her observations had been
well meant) the nurse carried off her charge.

"You look very well," Aunt Maria went on, "but older, my dear."

"I am both well and older," said May cheerfully. "Think of my responsibilities! There's the
baby! And then Alexander's been seedy. And we aren't as rich as we should like to be; you of
all people must know that. And there's going to be an election and our seat's very shaky. So
the cares of the world are on me."

"Sandro's been doing well."

"Splendidly, simply splendidly. It's impossible to doubt that he'll do great things if--if
all goes well, and he doesn't make mistakes."

"Seems like making mistakes, does he?"

"Oh, no. I only said 'if.'"

"And you're as happy as you expected to be?"

"Quite, thanks."

"I see. Just about," was Miss Quisanté's next observation; since it was a little hard to answer,
May smiled and rang the bell for tea.

"You're very gay, I suppose?" asked the old lady.

"Just as many parties as I can find gowns for," May declared.

"Seen anything of the Benyons lately?"

A little shadow came on May's face. "I hardly ever see Jimmy except at mother's," she answered.
"Dick comes sometimes." She paused a moment, and then added, "I expect him this afternoon."

"Is he still as devoted to Sandro?"

"He believes in his abilities as enthusiastically as ever." The dry laugh which Miss Quisanté
gave was as significant as her "Just about," a few minutes before. This time May did not laugh,
but looked gravely at Aunt Maria. "They've had a little difference on a political matter. Did
you ever hear of what Dick calls the Crusade? His great Church movement, you know."

"Lord, yes, my dear. Sandro once speechified to me about it for an hour."

"Well, he doesn't speechify so much now; he doesn't believe in it so much, and Dick's annoyed.
That's natural, I think, though perhaps it's a little silly of him. However, if you wait, he'll
tell you about it himself."

"Why doesn't Sandro believe in it so much?"

"Perhaps I ought to have said that he doesn't think the present time a suitable one for pressing
it."

"I see," said Miss Quisanté sipping her tea. May looked at her again and seemed about to speak,
but in the end she only smiled. She was amused at the old lady's questions, impelled to speak
plainly to her, and restrained only by the sense that any admission she might seem to make
would be used to the full against her husband by his faithful and liberal aunt.

"He says he has good reasons, and Dick Benyon says they're bad ones," she ended by explaining,
though it was not much of an explanation after all.

Miss Quisanté had the curiosity to await Dick Benyon's coming, and, in spite of his evident
expectation of a tête-à-tête, not to go immediately on his arrival. She was struck with the
air of mingled affection and compassion with which he greeted his healthy, handsome, smiling
young hostess. Moreover he was himself apologetic, as though suffering from a touch of remorse.
He began to talk trifles, but May brought him to the point.

"I read the speech after I got your letter," she said. "I'm sorry you don't like it, but Alexander
must consider the practical aspect of the matter. You won't do your cause any good by urging
it out of season."

"In season and out of season; that's the only way."

"You might be an Irish member," said May, smiling.

Dick was too much in earnest to be diverted to mirth. The presence of Miss Quisanté still seemed
to make him a little uncomfortable, but the old lady did not move. May gave her no hint, and
he was too full of his subject to hold his tongue.

"I want you to speak to him about it," he went on.

"To urge him to do what he thinks a mistake?"

Dick grew a little hot. "To urge him not to go back on the cause and on--on his friends, and
almost to laugh at them for----" He paused and looked at May; she was smiling steadily. He
did not end quite as bluntly as he had meant. "I think that he has, unconsciously no doubt,
allowed personal considerations to influence him."

A short sudden chuckle came from Aunt Maria; she rose to her feet and crossed the room to May.

"If he's going to abuse Sandro, I mustn't stay," she said. "I couldn't bear to lose any of
my illusions, my dear." She kissed May and added, "You might tell him to come and see me, though.
I should like to hear what he's got in his head now. Good-bye, Lord Richard. Don't you fret
about your Crusade. Sandro'll take it up again when it's convenient." She chuckled again at
the puzzled stare which accompanied Dick's shake of the hand.

"A very kind old woman, but with a rather malicious tongue," said May. She walked to the hearth
and stood there, facing her visitor. "Now, Dick, what is it?" she asked.

"The Dean's tremendously hurt about it; he doesn't say much, but he feels it deeply."

"I'm very sorry. What are the personal considerations?"

"You know Henstead?" It was the borough for which Quisanté sat. "There's an old Wesleyan colony
there; several of them are very rich and employ a lot of labour and so on. They've always voted
for us. And they've found a lot of the money. They found a lot when Quisanté got in before."

"Yes?" Her voice displayed interest but nothing more. Dick grew rather red and hurried on with
his story.

"Well, one of them, old Foster the maltster, came to your husband and--and told him they didn't
like the Crusade and that it wouldn't do." He paused, glanced at May for an instant, and ended,
"The seat's not safe, you know, and--and it wants money to fight it."

A silence of some few minutes followed. Dick fidgeted with his hat, while May looked out of
the window on to the river.

"Why do you come and tell this to me?" she asked presently. "Supposing it was all true, what
could I do?"

Dick's resentment got the better of him; he answered hotly, "Well, you might tell him that
it was playing it pretty low down on us."

"Have you told him that?"

"Yes, I have, or I shouldn't have come to you. I don't mean I used just those words, but I
made my meaning clear enough."

"And what did he say?"

"He said he didn't see it in the light I did."

A faint smile came on the face of Mr. Quisanté's wife.

"But you could make him see it," urged Dick. May smiled at him for a brief moment and then
looked out to the river again.

"It'll be deuced awkward for him if they get hold of his back speeches," said Dick with gloomy
satisfaction.

"Oh, everybody's back speeches are what you call deuced awkward." A moment later she went on,
"What does it all come to, after all? We must take things as they are; we mustn't be quixotic,
we mustn't quarrel with our bread-and-butter."

Dick looked at her with evident surprise, even with dismay.

"You think it all right?" he asked.

"It's not for me to say. Am I to sit in judgment on my husband? Anyhow people do just the same
thing every day. You know that as well as I do, Dick." Just on the last words her voice grew
softer; he might have caught a hint of entreaty, had not his mind been fixed on his own wrongs
and the betrayal of his favourite cause. "I'm assuming that what you say is true," she added,
more coldly again.

When Dick left her, it was to go home to his wife and tell her, and Mrs. Gellatly whom he found
with her, that he did not understand what had come over May Gaston--May Quisanté, he corrected
himself. Not understanding, he proved naturally quite unable to explain. Lady Richard was more
equal to the occasion.

"That man's simply got hold of her," she said. "She'll think black's white if he says it is.
Still she must see that he's treating you shamefully."

"She didn't seem to see it." moaned Dick mournfully. Then he laughed rather bitterly and added,
"I tell you what, though. I think that old aunt of his has taken his measure pretty well."

The innate nobility which underlay Lady Richard's nature showed up splendidly at this moment;
she sympathised heartily with Dick, and forbore to remind him of what she had said from the
beginning, contenting herself with remarking that for her part she never had considered and
did not now consider Mr. Quisanté even particularly clever.

"He's as clever as the deuce," said Dick. That conviction, at least, he need not surrender.

"I suppose," ventured Mrs. Gellatly, "that's how he convinces Lady May that he's always right."

Dick looked at her with a touch of covert contempt; clever people could convince the intellect,
but there were instincts of honour, of loyalty, and of fidelity which no arguments should be
able to blunt or to turn. Here was the thing which, vaguely felt, had so puzzled him in regard
to May Quisanté; he had not doubted that she would see the thing as he had seen it--as Quisanté
had professed himself unable to see it. He was a tall, stout, white-haired old man with a shrewd
kindly face, dressed all in broadcloth, showing an expanse of white shirt-front decorated with
a big black stud and a very small black wisp of a tie. His conversation indicated now and then
that he gave thought to the other world, always that he knew the ways of this. May liked him
in spite of the rather ponderous deference he showed to her; with Quisanté, on the other hand,
he was familiar, seeming to say that he could tell the younger man a thing or two; Quisanté's
manner did nothing to contradict this implied assumption.

"What we want, sir," said Foster, "is to have you in the Government. Once you're there, you'll
sit for Henstead till you die or go to the House of Lords. Nobody'll be able to touch you.
But this time's critical, very critical. They'll have a strong candidate, and they'll do all
they know to keep you out. It's not a time for offending anybody." He turned to May. "I hope
your ladyship will let us see you very often in the town?" he said.

"When the election begins, I shall come down with my husband and stay all the time."

"That's right; you'll be worth a hundred votes." He threw himself back in his chair. "Under
God," he said, "we ought to be safe. Your speech had an excellent effect; I sent it to Middleton,
and Dunn, and Japhet Williams, and when I met 'em at the Council, they were all most pleasant
about it. I think you've undone all the bad impression."

"I only said what I thought," observed Quisanté.

"Yes, yes, just so; oh, just so, of course." His tone was not in the least ironical, but a
little hurried, as though, having put the thing in a way that might sound ambiguous, he hastened
to prevent any possible misapprehension. May had looked for a twinkle in his eye, but his eye
was guilty of no such frivolity.

"I had a letter from Mr. Japhet Williams the other day," said Quisanté. "He was annoyed at
a vote I gave in Committee on the Truck Act. You know I voted against the Government once,
in favour of what I thought fairer treatment of the men; not that any real hardship on the
employer was involved."

"Just so, just so," said Mr. Foster. "That's the worst of Japhet. He doesn't look at the matter
in a broad way. But I've put that all right, sir. I met him on the Cemetery Board, and walked
home with him, and I said, 'Look here Japhet, that vote of Mr. Quisanté's 'll be worth fifty
votes among the men.' 'I don't care for that,' he said; 'I'm against interference.' 'So am
I,' I told him; 'but where's the harm? Mr. Quisanté must have his own opinion here and there--that
comes of having a clever man--but (I said) the Government had a hundred majority there, and
Mr. Quisanté knew it.' Well, he saw that, and admitted that he'd been wrong to make a fuss
about it."

Quisanté nodded grave appreciation. May gave a little laugh, and suddenly poured out a glass
of claret for Mr. Foster; turning, he found her eyes on his face, sparkling with amusement.
His own large features relaxed into a slow smile; something like the twinkle was to be detected
now.

"Nothing's the worse for a bit of putting, is it?" he said, and drank his wine at a gulp.

"You're a diplomatist, Mr. Foster," said she.

"Not to the detriment of truth; I assure you I don't sacrifice that," he replied, with renewed
gravity and an apparently perfect sincerity.

May was sorry when he took his leave, partly for the temporary loss of a study which amused
her, more because his departure brought the time for telling Quisanté of Dick Benyon's visit.
She did not want to tell him and anticipated no result, yet she felt herself bound to let him
know about it. To this mind her eighteen months of marriage had brought her. In the quite early
days, while not blind to the way he looked at things when left to himself, she had been eager
to show him how she looked at them, and, with the memory of her triumphs during their engagement,
very sanguine that she would be able always to convert him from his view to hers, to open his
eyes and show him the truth as it seemed to her. This hopeful mood she had for nearly a year
past been gradually abandoning. She had once asked Morewood whether people must always remain
what they were; now she inclined to answer yes to her own question. But she could not convince
herself so thoroughly as to feel absolved from the duty of trying to prove that the true answer
was no. She must offer her husband every chance still, she must not acquiesce, she must not
give up the game yet; some day she might (she smiled at herself here) awake an impulse or happen
on a moment so great as really to influence, to change, and to mould him. But she had come
to hate this duty; she would rather have left things alone; as a simple matter of inclination,
she wished that she felt free to sit and smile at Quisanté as she had at old Foster the maltster.
She could not; Foster was not part of her life, near and close to her, her chosen husband,
the father of her child. Unless she clung to her effort, and to her paradoxical much-disappointed
hope, her life and the thought of what she had done with it would become unendurable. Dick
and his wife had not quite understood what had come over her.

If Mr. Foster was diplomatic, so was she; she set before her husband neither Dick's complaints
nor her own misgivings in their crudity; she started by asking how his change of front would
affect people and instanced Dick and herself only as examples of how the thing might strike
certain minds. She must feed him with the milk of rectitude, for its strong meat his stomach
was hopelessly unready. But he was suspicious, and insisted on hearing what Dick Benyon had
said; so she told him pretty accurately. His answer was a long disquisition on the political
situation, to which she listened with the same faint smile with which she had heard Dick himself;
at last he roundly stigmatised the Crusade as a visionary and impracticable scheme.

"I stuck to it as long as I could," he said, "but you wouldn't have me risk everything for it?"

"Or even anything?" she asked.

The question was a spark to him. Gladly leaving the immediate question, he dilated on all that
the coming contest meant to him, how victory would assure his prospects, how defeat might leave
him hopelessly out in the cold, how it would be absurd to lose all that he was going to accomplish
for the sake of a hasty promise and a cause that he had come to disbelieve in. "When did you
come to disbelieve in it?" was the question in her heart; he saw it in her eyes.

"It's a little hard to have to explain everything in private as well as in public," he complained.
"And my head's fit to split."

"Don't trouble any more about it; only I thought I'd better tell you what Dick said." She came
to him as he lay back in his chair and put her hand on his brow. He was tired, not only looking
tired; his head did ache, she had no doubt; to turn these afflictions to account had always
been his way; so long ago as the Imperial League banquet she remembered it. "Go to bed," she
said. "I'll write a few letters first."

"I want you to understand me," he said. He loved her and she had made him uneasy; her good
opinion was very necessary to his happiness.

"I do understand you," she said, and persuaded him to go upstairs, while she sat down by the
fire, forgetful apparently of the excuse that she had made for lingering.

Did she repent? That question came often into her mind. She well might, for one of the great
hopes with which she had married was quite gone by now. There was no longer any possibility
of maintaining that the faults were of manner only, no longer any reasonable expectation that
she would be able to banish or materially to diminish them. It was for better for worse with
a vengeance then. But did she repent? There were times when she wept, times when she shuddered,
times when she scorned, even times when she hated. But had she ever so felt as to be confident
that if Omnipotence had offered to undo the past, she would have had the past undone? There
had perhaps been one such occasion quite early in the marriage, and the woe of it had been
terrible; but it was followed almost immediately by a "moment," by an inspired outbreak of
his over some case in the paper, by a vow to see an injustice remedied, a ceaseless, unsparing,
unpaid month's work to that end, a triumph over wrong and prejudice in the cause of a helpless
woman. He had nearly killed himself over it, the doctor said, and May had watched by his bed,
without tears, but with a conviction that if he died she must die also; because it seemed as
though he had faced death rather than her condemnation. That was not the truth of it, of course,
but she and he between them had made it seem the truth to her.

And now, with all the meanness of this abandonment of his friends, with all this fawning on
the moneyed Wesleyans before her eyes, she could not declare that she repented, lest he, waking
again to greatness, should plunge her again into the depths of abasement. But that the same
man should be great and mean, and should escape arraignment for his meanness by making play
with his headache! She smiled now to remember how great the mere faults of manner had once
seemed to her girlish fastidiousness; they were small to her now; her teeth were set on edge
indeed, but by a sharper sourness than lay in them. To the faults of manner she had grown to
some extent accustomed; she had become an adept in covering and excusing them. To-day, in her
interview with Dick Benyon, she had turned alike art on to the other faults. A new thought
and a new apprehension came into her mind.

"If I go on defending him," she murmured, "shall I end by getting like him and really think
it all right? I wonder!" For it was difficult not to identify herself with her cause, and he
was now her cause. Who asks a lawyer to disbelieve his own client, who asks a citizen to be
extreme to mark what is done amiss in his country's quarrel?

"Now if the Dean did chance to do anything wrong, Mrs. Baxter simply wouldn't see that it was
wrong," she meditated. "Neither would Amy Benyon, if Dick did. I see it's wrong and yet defend
it. I'm the wrong sort of woman to have married Alexander."

Yes, from that point of view, undoubtedly. But there was another. What would Mrs. Baxter or
Lady Richard have made of him at the times when he woke to greatness? Dick had appreciated
him then; Dick's wife never had; she saw only the worst. Well, it was plain to see. May saw
it so plain that night that she sat where she was till the night was old because, if she went
upstairs, she might find him there. And she fell to wishing that the seat at Henstead was not
shaky; so much hung on it, her hopes for him as well as his own hopes, her passionate interest
in him as well as his ambition. Nay, she had a feeling or a fear that more still hung on it.
Pondering there alone in the night, assessing her opinion and reviewing her knowledge of him,
she told herself that there was hardly anything that he would not do sooner than lose the seat.
So that she dreaded the struggle for the strain it might put on him; strains of that sort she
knew now that he was not able to bear. "Lead us not into temptation," was the prayer which
must be on her lips for him; if that were not answered, he was well-nigh past praying for altogether.
For with temptation came his blindness, and he no longer saw the thing that tempted him for
what it was. Oh, and what a fool she had been to think that she could make him see!

At last she went upstairs, slowly and reluctantly. Passing her own door, she mounted again
to the baby's nursery, and entered softly. All was peace; both baby and nurse slept. May was
smiling as she came down the stairs; she murmured, "Gaston!" mimicking the satisfied tones
of old Aunt Maria's voice. Then she entered her own room; Quisanté's bed was empty. A sense
of great relief rose in her, but she went out again and softly turned the handle of his dressing-room
door. He had elected to sleep there, as he often did. The light was still high; a book lay
open by him on the bed. He was in deep sleep, looking very pale, very tired, very peaceful.
She stood looking at him for a moment; again she smiled as she stole forward and peeped at
the book. It was a work on Bimetallism. I that has shine from repast-besmeared countenance when i detect

 "It makes
a difference, you see. We only beat young Fortescue, a stranger in the town, by two hundred,
and they had four hundred the time before." He paused and added, "Lady Mildmay's very much
liked in the town."

"Come, Blair, I'm sure we shan't be worse off in that respect anyhow," said Marchmont, laughing.

"Oh, I've nothing to do with you, I've given you up," cried Blair, twisting his good-humoured
face into a fierce scowl. "He's a man with convictions, Lady May; he's no sort of use to me."

Blair had convictions himself, but he and everybody else took them so much for granted that
they might almost as well not have existed; they were polite convictions too, ready to give
place not only to one another but even to circumstances, and waiting quite patiently their
turn to be realised. He expected to be met in a like spirit, conceiving that the true function
of a man's own opinions is to decide which party he shall belong to; with that decision their
duty was ended. He possessed an extremely cordial manner, dressed perfectly, and never forgot
anybody. He enjoyed his work immensely, quarrelling with nothing in it save that it often prevented
him from being present at the first performances of new plays. May thought him pleasant, but
did not welcome his appearance to-day; he smacked too strongly of those politics distinctively
practical from which her talk with Marchmont had afforded a temporary escape.

"I know Mildmay," said Marchmont. "He's a capital fellow and, I should think, very popular.
He'll give you a bit of a run."

"From what I hear he'll run us very close indeed," said Blair with an anxious look. "However
I've unlimited confidence in your husband, Lady May. If Mildmay is to be beaten Quisanté'll
beat him; if there is a weak spot he'll find it out."

May smiled faintly; what Blair said was so true.

"Perhaps," smiled Marchmont, "you'll be able to ferret out something about him."

May turned to him and said with a touch of sharpness, "We shall fight fairly anyhow, I hope."
She saw that she surprised him and went on with a laugh, "You shouldn't talk as if we were
going to set detectives on him and use their information for electioneering."

"Well, hardly," said Constantine Blair. "Still, mind you, a constituency has a right to know
that its member is an honourable and equitable man as well as a supporter of the principles
it favours."

"Excellently well put, Blair," said Marchmont languidly. "Is it your own?"

"No!" said May, with a sudden laugh. "I believe it's my husband's."

Blair looked a little put out, but his good-humour triumphed. "I'm not above borrowing from
my betters," he said. "Quisanté did say something of the sort to me, but how in the world did
you know? Has he said it to you?"

"Oh, no; I knew by--oh, just by the subtle sympathy that exists between husband and wife, Mr.
Blair." She laughed again and glanced at Marchmont. "Sir Winterton must look out for the detectives,
mustn't he?" she ended.

Marchmont saw, though Blair did not, that she jested uneasily and reaped no pleasure, although
she reaped amusement, from her clever recognition of her husband's style. She had spoken in
much the same tone about the difference with Dick Benyon and the suspicions which Dick cast
on "our sincerity." He came near to perceiving and understanding what was in her mind--what
had been there as she watched Quisanté sleeping. The first suggestion of ferreting out something
had come from him, purely in the way of a cynical jeer, just because nobody would ever suspect
him of seriously contemplating or taking part in such a thing. Well, May Quisanté did not apparently
feel quite so confident about her husband.

Blair bustled off, with a parting mysterious hint that they must lose no time in preparing
for the fray--it might begin any week now--and May's face relaxed into a more genuine smile.

"He does enjoy it so," she explained. But Marchmont was not thinking of Blair. He asked her
abruptly,

"You'll go to Henstead and help him, I suppose?"

"Of course. I shall be with him right through. He'll want all the help I can give him. It's
everything to him to win this time."

"Yes, I know." Her voice had become troubled again; she was very anxious for her husband's
success; but was she anxious about something else too? "If I can help you, let me," he said
as he rose to go.

She gave him her hand and looked in his face.

"I'm afraid that most likely I shouldn't be able to ask you," she said gravely. The answer,
as she gave it, meant so much to him, and even seemed to admit so much, that he wondered at
once at her insight into his thoughts and at her frankness in facing what she found there.
For did she not in truth mean that she might want help most on some occasion when the loyalty
he had himself approved would forbid her to reveal her distress to him or to seek his succour?
He ventured, after an instant's hesitation, on one word.

"After all," he said, "you can't trundle the world's wheelbarrow in white kid gloves; at least
you soil them."

"Then why trundle it?" she asked. "At any rate you needn't say that sort of thing. Leave that
to Mr. Blair."

Not only was the time when everybody had to be bestirring themselves approaching rapidly, but
the appearance of Sir Winterton Mildmay in the list quickened the Quisantés' departure for
the scene of action. Rooms were taken at the Bull in Henstead, an election agent appointed,
resources calculated--this involved a visit to Aunt Maria--and matters got into fighting trim.
During this period May had again full cause to thank her power of humour; it almost scattered
the gloomy and (as she told herself) fanciful apprehensions which had gathered round, and allowed
her to study with amusement her husband's preparations. He talked very freely to her always
about his political views, and now he consulted her on the very important question of his Election
Address. He reminded her of a man packing his portmanteau for a trip and not quite knowing
what he would want, whether (for example) shooting boots would come in useful, or warm underclothing
be essential. Space was limited, needs difficult to foresee, climate very uncertain. Some things
were obviously necessary, such as the cry on which the Government was going to the country;
others were sure to be serviceable; in went "something for Labour" (she gathered the phrase
from Quisanté's rough notes); odd corners held little pet articles of the owner's things which
he had found unexpectedly useful on a previous journey, or which might seem especially adapted
to the part of the world he was going to visit. On the local requirements Mr. Foster the maltster
was a very Baedeker. With constant effort on Quisanté's part, with almost unfailing amusement
on his wife's, the portmanteau got itself filled.

"Are you sure there's nothing else, Alexander?" she asked.

"I think I've got everything that's of real service," said he. "I don't want to overload it."

Of course not; excess luggage may be very expensive. May was smiling as she handed back the
Address.

"It's extraordinarily clever," she remarked. "You are extraordinarily clever, you know."

"There's nothing in it that isn't pretty obvious," said he, though he was well pleased.

"Oh, to you, yes, obvious to you; that's just it," she said.

But amongst all that was in the portmanteau there was nothing that could be construed into
a friendly word for the Crusade; and were not the anxious minds of the Henstead Wesleyans meant
to read a disclaimer of that great movement in a reference to "the laudable and growing activity
of all religious denominations, each within the sphere of its own action"? "next countermine" has

 Undoubtedly he had said "No more of it." And now he had pinned
it as his colours to the mast. May found herself looking at him with as fresh an interest and
as great a fear as in the first weeks of their marriage. Would she in her heart have had him
honest over No. 77, honest and inglorious? Or was she coming to think as he did, and to ask
little concerning honesty? What would Weston Marchmont think of the affair? Or, short of that,
how Morewood would smile and the Dean shake his head!

The No. 77 episode was very typical of that time, and most typical of Alexander Quisanté's
conduct, of Sandro's way. His best and his worst, his highest and his lowest, were called out;
at one moment he wheedled an ignorant fool with flattery, at another he roused keen honest
men to fine enthusiasm; now he seemed to have no thought that was not selfish and mean, now
imagination rapt him to a glow of heart-felt patriotism. The good and the bad both stood him
in stead, and hope reigned in his camp. But all hung in the balance, for Sir Winterton was
tall and handsome, bluff and hearty, a good landlord, a good sportsman, a good man, a neighbour
to the town and a friend to half of it. And the great cry did not seem like proving a great
success.

"It's up-hill work against Sir Winterton," said Japhet Williams, rubbing his thin little hands
together.

A troubled look spread over the broad face of that provincial diplomatist, Mr. Foster the maltster;
he knew where the danger lay. They would come to Quisanté's meetings, applaud him, admire him,
be proud of his efforts to please them; but when the day came would they not think (and would
not their wives remind them) that Sir Winterton was a neighbour and a friend and that Lady
Mildmay was kind and sweet? Then, having shouted for Quisanté, would they not in the peaceful
obscurity of the ballot put their cross opposite Mildmay's name?

"I'm not easy about it, sir, that I'm not," said Foster, wiping his broad red brow.

Quisanté was not easy either, as his lined face and his high-strung manner showed; he was half-killing
himself and he was not easy. So much hung on it; before all England he had backed himself to
win, and in the strain of his excitement it seemed to him that the stake he laid was his whole
reputation. Was all that to go, and to go on no great issue, but just because Sir Winterton
was bluff and cheery and Lady Mildmay kind and sweet? Another thing he knew about himself;
if he lost this time, he must be out in the cold at least for a long time; he could not endure
another contest, even if the offer of a candidature came to him, even though Aunt Maria found
the funds. Everything was on this fling of the dice then; and it seemed to him almost iniquitous
that he should lose because Sir Winterton was bluff and cheery and his wife kind and sweet.
His face was hard and cunning as he leant across towards old Foster and said in a low voice,
with a sneering smile,

"I suppose there's nothing against this admirable gentleman?"

Old Foster started a little, recollecting perhaps that fine passage in the speech which opened
the campaign, the passage which defined the broad public lines of the contest and loftily disclaimed
any personal attack or personal animosity. But the next moment he smiled in answer, smiled
thoughtfully, as he tapped his teeth with the handle of his pen-knife. Quisanté sat puffing
at a cigar and looking straight at him with observant searching eyes.

"Anything against him, eh?" asked Foster in a ruminative tone.

"They've been ready enough to ask where I come from, and how I live, and so on."

"They know all that about Sir Winterton, you see, sir."

"Yes, confound them." The keen eyes were still on Foster; the fat old man shifted his position
a little and ceased to meet their regard. "We don't want to be beaten, you know," said Quisanté.

A silence of some minutes followed. Quisanté, rose and strolled off to a table, where he began
to sort papers; Foster sat where he was, frowning a little, with his mouth pursed up. He stole
a glance at Quisanté's back, a curious enquiring glance.

"I know nothing about the rights of it one way or the other," he said at last. "But some of
the men up at the mills and in my place still remember Tom Sinnett's affair. Only the other
night, as Sir Winterton drove by, one of them shouted out, 'Where's Susy Sinnett?'"

Quisanté went on sorting papers and did not turn round.

"Who the deuce is Susy Sinnett?" he asked indifferently, with a laugh.

"It was about five years ago--before Sir Winterton's split with the Liberals. Tom was a keeper
in Sir Winterton's employ, and Sir Winterton charged him with netting game and sending it to
London on his own account." Foster's narrative ceased and he looked again at his candidate's
back. The papers rustled and the cigar smoke mounted to the ceiling. "Well?" said Quisanté.

"Tom was found guilty at Sessions; but in the dock he declared Sir Winterton had trumped up
the charge to shut his mouth."

"What about?"

"Well, because he'd found Sir Winterton dangling after Susy, and threatened to break his head
if he found him there again." He paused, Quisanté made no comment. "Tom got nine months, and
when he came out all the family emigrated to Manitoba."

After a short pause, filled by the arrangement of papers, Quisanté observed, "That must have
cost money. He'd saved out of what he got for the game, eh?"

"It was supposed Sir Winterton found the money," said Foster, "but nothing was known. Sir Winterton
refused to make any statement. He said his friends would know what to think, and he didn't
care a damn (that was his word) about anybody else. Still some weren't satisfied. But the talk
died away, except here and there among the men who'd been Tom's pals. I daresay Tom gave 'em
a rabbit now and again in exchange for a pot of beer, and they missed him." Mr. Foster ended
with a little chuckle.

"I think Sir Winterton might have been a little more explicit," Quisanté remarked. "There's
some excuse for thinking an explanation not unnecessary. What became of the girl? Did she go
to Manitoba?"

"I believe she did in the end, but she'd married a man from Dunn's works and left the town
three months after her father was sent to prison."

Quisanté came back to the hearth and stood looking down on old Foster.

"Rather a queer story," he said. "But I meant, was there anything against him of a public nature,
in his local record, anything of that sort, you know."

"I know nothing of that kind," said Foster, raising his eyes and meeting his leader's. He looked
rather puzzled, as if he were still not quite sure what Quisanté's question had meant, in spite
of Quisanté's explanation of it. "I'd almost forgotten this, but Japhet Williams mentioned
it the other day. You know Japhet by now. He said he thought he ought to ask Sir Winterton
to make a statement."

A sudden gleam shot through Quisanté's eyes.

"Mr. Williams' active conscience at work again?" he asked with a sneering laugh.

"That's it," said Foster, still looking stolidly at his chief. "But I know Sir Winterton; he'd
only say what he did before."

Quisanté turned, flung the end of his cigar into the grate, and turned back to Foster, saying,

"Mr. Williams must do as he thinks right; but of course I can't have any hand in a matter of
that kind."

"Just so, just so," murmured Foster as hurriedly but even more vaguely than usual. His chief
was puzzling him still.

"I can't have anything at all to do with it," Quisanté repeated emphatically. Foster did not
quite know whence he gathered the impression, but he was left with the feeling that, if he
should chance ever to be asked what had passed between them on the subject, he must remember
this sentence at least, whatever else of the conversation he recollected or forgot.

"Of course you can't, sir. I only mentioned it in passing," said he.

"And you'd better tell Japhet Williams so, if he mentions the matter." The slightest pause
followed. "Or," added Quisanté, grinding his heel into the hearth rug as though in absence
of mind, "if it happens to crop up in talk between you."

Whether the matter did crop up as suggested or not is one of those points of secret history
which it seems useless to try to discover. But an incident which occurred the next evening
showed that Japhet Williams' mind and conscience had, either of their own motion or under some
outside direction, been concerning themselves with the question of Tom Sinnett and his daughter
Susy. There was a full and enthusiastic meeting of Sir Winterton's supporters. In spite of
Quisanté's victory over No. 77, they were in good heart and fine fighting fettle; Sir Winterton
was good-tempered and sanguine; there was enough opposition to give the affair go, not enough
to make itself troublesome. But at the end, after a few of the usual questions and the usual
verbal triumphs of the candidate, a small man rose from the middle of the hall. He was greeted
by hoots, with a few cheers mingling. The Chairman begged silence for their worthy fellow-townsman,
Councillor Japhet Williams.

Japhet was perfectly self-possessed; he had been, he said, as a rule a supporter of the opposite
party, but he kept his mind open and was free to admit that he had been considerably impressed
by some of the arguments which had fallen from Sir Winterton Mildmay that evening. The meeting
applauded, and Sir Winterton nodded and smiled. There was one matter, however, which he felt
it his duty to mention. Now that Sir Winterton Mildmay (the full name came with punctilious
courtesy every time) was appealing to a wider circle than that of his personal friends and
acquaintances, now that he--was seeking the confidence of his fellow-townsmen in general (A
voice "He's got it too," and cheers), would Sir Winterton Mildmay consider the desirability
of reconsidering the attitude he had taken up some time ago, and consider the desirability
(Japhet's speech was not very artistically phrased but he loved the long words) of making a
fuller public statement with reference to what he (Mr. Japhet Williams) would term the Sinnett
affair? And with this Japhet sat down, having caused what the reporters very properly described
as a "Sensation"--and an infinite deal of hooting and groaning to boot. But there were cheers
also from the back of the room, where a body of roughly dressed sturdy fellows sat sucking
at black clay pipes; these were men from the various works, from Dunn's and from Japhet's own.

As Japhet proceeded Sir Winterton's handsome face had grown ruddier and ruddier; when Japhet
finished, he sat still through the hubbub, but his hand twitched and he clutched the elbow
of his chair tightly. The platform collectively looked uncomfortable. The chairman--he was
Green, the linen-draper in High Street--glanced uneasily at Sir Winterton and then whispered
in his ear. Sir Winterton threw a short remark at him, the chairman shrank back with the appearance
of having been snubbed. Sir Winterton rose slowly to his feet, still very red in the face,
still controlling himself to a calmness of gesture and voice. But all he said in answer to
that most respected and influential townsman Mr. Japhet Williams was,

"No, I won't."

And down he plumped into his chair again.

Not a word of courtesy, not a word of respect for Japhet's motives, not even an appeal for
trust, not even a simple pledge of his word! A curt and contemptuous "No, I won't," was all
that Sir Winterton's feelings, or Sir Winterton's sensitiveness, or his temper, or his obstinacy,
allowed him to utter. Sir Winterton was a great man, no doubt, but at election times the People
also enjoys a transient sense of greatness and of power. The cheers were less hearty now, the
groans more numerous; the audience felt that, in its own person and in the person of Japhet
Williams, it was being treated with disrespect; already one or two asked, "If he's got a fair
and square answer, why don't he give it?" The superfine sense of honour, which feels itself
wounded by being asked for a denial and soiled by condescending to give one, is of a texture
too delicate for common appreciation. "No, I won't," said Sir Winterton, red in the face, and
the meeting felt snubbed. Why did he snub them? The meeting began to feel suspicious. There
were no more questions; the proceedings were hurried through; Sir Winterton drove off, pompous
in his anger, red from his hurt feelings, stiff in his obstinacy. The cheer that followed him
had not its former heartiness.

"I only did my duty," said Japhet to a group who surrounded him.

"That's right, Mr. Williams," he was answered. "We know you. Don't you let yourself be silenced,
sir." For everybody now remembered the Sinnett affair, which had seemed so forgotten, everybody
had a detail to tell concerning it, his own views to set forth, or those of some shrewd friend
to repeat. That night the taverns in the town were full of it, and at many a supper table the
story was told over again. As for Japhet, he dropped in at Mr. Foster's and told what he had
done, complaining bitterly of how Sir Winterton had treated him, declaring that he had been
prepared to listen to any explanation, almost to take Sir Winterton's simple word, but that
he was not to be bullied in a matter in which his own conscience and the rights of the constituency
were plainly and deeply involved. Mr. Foster said as little as he could.

"It won't do for me to take any part," he remarked. "I'm too closely connected with Mr. Quisanté,
and I know he wouldn't wish to enter into such a matter."

"I'm not acting as a party man," said Japhet Williams, "and this isn't a party matter. But
a plain answer to a plain question isn't much to ask, and I mean to ask for it till I get it,
or know the reason why I can't."

Dim rumours of a "row" at Sir Winterton's meeting reached the Bull that night, brought by Jimmy
Benyon, who had been at a minor meeting across the railway bridge among the railway men. Somebody
had brought up an old scandal, and the candidate's answer had not given satisfaction. The ladies
showed no curiosity; Quisanté, very tired, lay on the sofa doing nothing, neither reading,
nor talking, nor sleeping. His eyes were fixed on the ceiling, he seemed hardly to hear what
Jimmy said, and he also asked no questions. So Jimmy, dismissing the matter from his mind,
went to bed, leaving Quisanté still lying there, with wide-open eyes.

There he lay a long while alone; once or twice he frowned, once or twice he smiled. Was he
thinking over the opportunity that offered, and the instrument that presented itself? What
chances might lie in Sir Winterton's dogged honour and tender sensitiveness on the one hand,
and on the other in that conscience of little Japhet's, stronger now in its alliance with hurt
pride and outraged self-importance! And nobody could say that Quisanté himself had had any
part in it; he had spoken to nobody except Foster, and he had told Foster most plainly that
he would have nothing to do with such a matter. There he lay, making his case, the case he
could tell to all the world, the case Foster also could tell, the case that both Foster and
he could and would tell, if need be, to all the world, to all the world--and to May Quisanté.

"Sandro always has a case," said Aunt Maria. He had a case about what Japhet termed the Sinnett
affair, just as he had had a case, and a very strong one as it had proved, about placard No.
77. When at last he dragged his weary overdone body to bed, his lips were set tight and his
eyes were eager. It was the look that meant something in his mind, good or bad, but anyhow
a resolution, and the prospect of work to be done. Had May seen him then, she would have known
the look, and hoped and feared. But she was sleeping, and none asked Quisanté what was in his
mind that night.

                             CHAPTER XII.

                      A HIGHLY CORRECT ATTITUDE.

Up to the present time all had gone most smoothly at Moors End, the Mildmays' old manor-house,
eight miles from Henstead, and Lady Mildmay had confided many quiet self-congratulations to
Mrs. Baxter's ear. For it had seemed possible that the election might prove a cause of perturbation.
Lady Mildmay was still in love with her handsome well-preserved husband, and had every confidence
in him, but to a chosen friend she would sometimes admit that he was "difficult"; she called
him not proud and obstinate, but sensitive and a little touchy; she hinted that he could not
bear unpleasant looks, and yet was not very ready to make concessions to friendship. No doubt
he needed some management, and Lady Mildmay, like many wives, found one of her chief functions
to consist in acting as a buffer between her husband and a world which did not always approach
him with enough gentleness and consideration. Hence her joy at the prosperous passage of a
critical time, at the enthusiasm of their supporters, and at the gratification and urbanity
of Sir Winterton. Satisfaction begat charity, and Lady Mildmay had laughingly dismissed some
portentous hints which Mrs. Baxter let fall about the certain character and the probable tactics
of Mr. Quisanté.

"His wife looks so nice, he can't be very bad," said kind Lady Mildmay, using an argument of
most uncritical charity.

Although the Dean, if pressed, must have ranked himself among his host's political opponents,
he was so little of a party man and had so many points of sympathy with Sir Winterton (especially
on Church matters) that he very contentedly witnessed the contest from Moors End and no longer
troubled himself to conceal his hopes of a Moors End triumph. Nevertheless he was judiciously
reticent about Quisanté, generously eulogistic of May. Sir Winterton looked forward to making
the acquaintance of both, but thought that the occasion had better be postponed till they had
ceased to be opponents.

"But I hope you and your wife'll go over as often as you like," he said to the Dean very cordially.
But the Dean and Mrs. Baxter did not go, perhaps preferring not to divide their sympathies,
perhaps fearing that they might seem like spies and be suspected of carrying back information
to the rival camp. "I dare say you're wise," said Sir Winterton, rather relieved; he had made
the suggestion because it was the handsome thing to do, but was not eager that it should be
accepted. To do the handsome thing and to meet with pleasant looks were the two requisites
most essential to Sir Winterton's happiness; given these he was at his best and his best was
a fine specimen of the class to which he belonged. There was, however, a weak side to these
two desires of his, as the history of the Sinnett affair to some extent indicated.

The first shock to Sir Winterton's good temper had been the matter of No. 77; until then he
had been lavish of the usual polite compliments to his opponent's personal character. After
No 77's prodigal reappearance and Quisanté's rhetorical effort in defence of it these assurances
were no more on his lips, and for a time he bore himself with strict reserve when Quisanté
was mentioned. He had been right in the dispute, and he had been beaten; silence was the utmost
that could be expected of his tolerance or his self-control; his refusal to speak on the subject
showed his opinion well enough, and he must not be blamed too severely if he listened without
protest and perhaps with pleasure to Mrs. Baxter's pungent criticisms. Of course she had been
reminded of something--of the strictures which a certain Provincial Editor had passed on the
household arrangements of a certain Minor Canon; a libel action had ensued, and the jury had
been beguiled into finding for the defendant on a bare literal construction of words which
to anybody acquainted with local circumstances bore another and much blacker meaning. This
Mrs. Baxter called a pettifogging trick, and she pursued her parallel till the same terms were
obviously indicated as appropriate to Quisanté's conduct.

"My dear!" said the Dean in mild protest; but Sir Winterton laughed as though he had enjoyed
the story. He was at once favoured with the further parallel of the Girdlestones' coachman
and, as the conversation drifted to May, of the Nonconformist Minister's daughter and the Circus
Proprietor. All Mrs. Baxter's armoury of reminiscence was heartily at his service.

But No. 77 did not after all touch Sir Winterton very closely. His temper had begun to recover
and he had nearly forgiven Quisanté when suddenly Japhet Williams produced a far more severe
and deadly shock. His action was a bomb, and a bomb thrown from a hand which Moors End had
been fain to think was or might be friendly. Was not Japhet a neighbour, only two miles off
along the Henstead Road, and did not Lady Mildmay and Mrs. Williams, religious differences
notwithstanding, work together every year on the Committee of the Cottage Gardens and Window-Boxes
Show? Had not Japhet himself been understood to be reconsidering his political opinions? There
was even more. The Sinnett affair was the one subject utterly forbidden, most rigidly tabooed,
at Moors End. All Sir Winterton's relatives, friends, acquaintances, and dependents knew that
well. Sir Winterton's honour and temper had never been so wounded as over that affair. By Japhet's
hand it was dragged into light again; the odious thing became once more the gossip of Henstead,
once more a disgusting topic which it was impossible wholly to ignore at Moors End. This was
plain enough since, on the morning after Japhet's question had been put, Lady Mildmay was discussing
the position with Mrs. Baxter in the morning-room, while the Dean and Sir Winterton walked
round and round the lawn in gloomy conversation punctuated by gloomier silences.

What the actual history was Lady Mildmay's narrative showed pretty accurately. Sir Winterton's
predominant desires, to do the handsome thing and to meet with pleasant looks, evidently had
played a large part. Lady Mildmay blushed a little and smiled as she began by observing that
Sir Winterton had distinguished the girl by some kind notice; he liked her, he always liked
nice-spoken nice-looking girls; for her sake and her mother's (a very decent woman), he had
forgiven Tom many irregularities. At last his patience gave out and Tom was prosecuted; when
arrested, Tom had tried blackmail; Sir Winterton was not to be bullied, and Tom's speech from
the dock was no more than an outburst of defeated malice.

Then came on the scene Sir Winterton's kind heart and his predominant desires. He had made
the girl a present to facilitate her marriage and had got the husband work away from the town,
where no gossip would have reached. This seemed enough, and so Doctor Tillman, an old and wise
friend, urged. But as the time of Tom's release approached and his wife made preparations for
receiving him in a cottage just on the edge of Sir Winterton's estate, it became odious to
think of the black looks and scowls which would embitter every ride in that direction. "I want
to forget the whole thing, to get rid of it, to blot it all out," said Sir Winterton fretfully.
Prison had induced reason in Tom Sinnett; he made his submission and accepted the liberal help
which carried him and his wife, his daughter and her husband, to a new life across the seas.
Then Sir Winterton had peace in his heart and abroad; he had behaved most handsomely, and there
were no scowling faces to remind him of the hateful episode. He had met the gossip boldly and
defiantly; it had died away and had seemed utterly forgotten and extinct; the low grumbles
and not very seemly jokes which still lingered among the men at the various works in Henstead,
where Tom had been a persona grata, never reached the ears of the great folk at Moors End;
it is perhaps only at election times that such things become audible in such quarters.

The poor lady ended with a careworn smile; she had suffered much during the episode, and perhaps
the more because her faith in her husband had never wavered.

"I did so hope it was all over," she said.

"That's a good deal to hope about anything," observed Mrs. Baxter rather grimly.

"It does annoy Winterton so terribly. I'm afraid it'll quite upset him."

Mrs. Baxter had her own opinion about Sir Winterton; amid much that was favourable, she had
no doubt that he was far too ready to get on the high horse.

"Well, my dear," she said, "Sir Winterton'll have to do what many people have; he must swallow
his pride and tell the truth about it."

"I don't think he will," sighed Lady Mildmay, looking out at her husband's tall imposing figure,
and marking the angry energy with which he was impressing his views on the Dean.

In this case at least Mrs. Baxter was right. Sir Winterton had got on the very highest of horses;
he had mounted at the meeting, flinging back his "No, I won't," as he sprang to the saddle;
he was firmly seated; having got up, he declared that he could not think of coming down. There,
for good or evil, he sat. The Dean looked vexed and puzzled.

"This Mr. Williams is an honest man, I suppose?" he asked.

"Oh, honest as the day, too honest. But he's an infernal little ass," said Sir Winterton. "Somebody's
got hold of him and is using him, or he's heard some gossip and caught it up. I won't say a
word." And he went on to ask if he were to degrade himself by making explanations and excuses
for his personal conduct to all the rowdies and loafers of Henstead. "If I have to do that
to get in, why, I'll stay out, and be hanged to them." His face suggested that his language
would have been still more vigorous but for a respect due to the Dean's cloth.

Later in the day they all had a turn at him, his wife pleading tenderly, Mrs. Baxter exhorting
trenchantly (he came nearer to being told he was a fool than had ever happened to him before),
the Dean suggesting possible diplomacies, Dr. Tillman, whom they sent for as a reinforcement,
declaring that a few simple words, authorised by Sir Winterton, would put the whole matter
right. He was obstinate; he had taken up his position and meant to stand by it; his conscience
was clear and his honour safe in his own keeping; he would not speak himself and explicitly
forbade any statement to be made on his behalf. Surely some power fought for Alexander Quisanté
in giving him an opponent of this temper!

"If any statement is to be made in reference to the matter," said Sir Winterton, rather red
in the face again by now, "I confess to thinking that it would come best from Mr. Quisanté.
In fact I think that a few words would come very gracefully from Mr. Quisanté."

Lady Mildmay caught at the hope. "If it was suggested to him, I'm sure----"

"Suggested!" cried Sir Winterton. "Is it likely I should suggest it or permit any of my friends
to do so? I was merely speculating on what might not unnaturally suggest itself to a gentleman
in Mr. Quisanté's position."

Mrs. Baxter's smile was very eloquent of her opinion on this particular point. The Dean frowned
perplexedly.

"There are exigencies to be considered," he stammered. "The views of his supporters----"

"In a matter like this?" asked Sir Winterton in a tone of lofty surprise. The Dean felt that
he had rather committed himself, and did not venture to remind his sensitive host that after
all Quisanté had no knowledge of the truth or falsehood of the story, and could say nothing
beyond that he had none. Mrs. Baxter, however, spoke plainly.

"Let me tell you," she said, "that if you expect anything of the sort from Alexander Quisanté,
you'll find yourself mistaken."

"I don't know that I agree with you there, my dear," said the Dean, entering his usual caveat.
"I think very likely Mr. Quisanté would be willing to do the proper thing if it were pointed
out to him."

"Pointed out!" murmured Sir Winterton, raising his brows. Did gentlemen need to have the proper
thing pointed out to them? Did they not see it for themselves and do it? Nay, one might look
for more than the mere naked proper thing; from a gentleman the handsome thing was to be expected,
and that of his own motion. There could, in Sir Winterton's view, be no doubt of what was in
this case the handsome thing.

Unhappily, there is no subject on which greater divergence of opinion exists than that of the
proper thing to be done under given circumstances. Here was Sir Winterton holding one view;
Japhet Williams held another, and it is to be feared that a section of the inhabitants of Henstead
adopted a third. Sir Winterton's cry was honour, Japhet's was duty; the inhabitants would have
differed rather even among themselves as to how to describe their motive; party spirit, curiosity,
the zest of a personal question, interest in a promising quarrel, mere mischief, all had a
hand in producing the applause which greeted Japhet when he rose the next evening and with
absolute imperturbability repeated the same question as nearly as possible in the same words.
Sir Winterton's answer was not in the same words, but entirely to the same effect. "I've answered
that question once, and I won't answer it again," he said. Then came the tumult, and after
that a dull unenthusiastic ending, and the drive off through a grinning crowd, which enjoyed
Sir Winterton's fury and added to it by a few hateful cries of "Where's Susy Sinnett?" From
the outskirts of the town till his own gates were reached Sir Winterton did not speak to his
wife. Then he turned to her and said very courteously but most decisively,

"Marion dear, you will oblige me by not accompanying me to any more meetings at present and
by not visiting the town just now. I don't choose to expose you to any more such scenes. I
can't teach these fellows to respect a lady's presence, but I can protect my wife by ensuring
her absence." He looked very chivalrous and very handsome as he made this little speech. But
his wife's heart sank; such an attitude could mean nothing but defeat.

"Can't you help us?" she implored of the Dean, when she had got him alone and told him of this
new development of her husband's pride or temper. It was evident that Japhet Williams meant,
as he had said, to go on putting his plain question till he got a plain answer, and so long
as he put his question, Lady Mildmay was not to be present. How soon would Henstead understand
that the gentleman who sought to be its member openly declared that he did not consider it
a fit place for his wife to enter?

"Something must really be done," said the Dean nervously. "At all hazards." They both knew
that "at all hazards" meant in spite of the prohibition and in face of the wrath of Sir Winterton.

Indeed this impulsive gentleman, seated on his high horse, was in urgent need of being saved
from himself. Hitherto Japhet's importunity and the attacks of less conscientious opponents
had had the natural effect of rousing his supporters to greater enthusiasm and greater zeal.
When his fresh step began to be understood, when Lady Mildmay came with him no more, and it
dawned upon Henstead that Sir Winterton would not bring her, the very supporters felt themselves
offended. Were a few ribald cries and the folly of a wrong-headed old Japhet Williams to outweigh
all their loyalty and devotion? Was the town to be judged by its rowdies? They could not but
remember that Lady May Quisanté sat smiling through the hottest meetings, and one evening had
at the last moment saved her husband's platform from being stormed by sitting, composed and
immovable, in the very middle of it till the rioters came to a stand a foot from her, and then
retreated cowed before her laughter. That was the sort of thing Henstead liked; to be told
that it was unworthy of Lady Mildmay's presence was not what it liked. A strong deputation
came out to Sir Winterton; he replied from his high horse; the deputation averred that they
could not answer for the consequences; Sir Winterton said he did not care a rush about the
consequences; the deputation ventured timidly to hint that an excessive care to shield Lady
Mildmay's ears from any mention of the Sinnett affair might be misunderstood; Sir Winterton
said that he had nothing to do with that; his first duty was to his wife, his second to himself.
The deputation retired downcast and annoyed.

"If you're going to do anything, Dan, you'd better do it at once," said Mrs. Baxter.

The Dean, resolved to risk Sir Winterton's anger in Sir Winterton's interest, did something;
he wrote covertly to Jimmy Benyon at the Bull, begging him to be riding on the Henstead road
at ten o'clock the next morning; the Dean would take a walk and the pair would meet, as it
was to seem, accidentally; nothing had been said to Sir Winterton, nothing was to be said at
present to Mr. Quisanté. The Dean was, in fact, most carefully unofficial, and in no small
fright besides; yet he was also curious to know how this new phase of the fight was regarded
at the Quisanté headquarters.

Jimmy came punctually, greeted the Dean most heartily, and listened to all that he said. The
Dean could not quite make out his mood; he seemed uncomfortable and vexed, but he was not embarrassed,
and was able to state what the Dean took to be the Quisanté position with so much clearness
that the Dean could not help wondering whether he had received instructions.

"Quisanté's line has been to take absolutely no notice of the whole thing," said Jimmy. "He
knows nothing about it, and has had nothing to do with its being brought forward; he's never
mentioned it, and he won't. But on the other hand he doesn't feel called upon to fight Mildmay's
battle, or to offend his own supporters by defending a man who won't defend himself. As for
this business about Lady Mildmay, if Mildmay likes to make such an ass of himself he must take
the consequences."

The Dean felt that the Quisanté case even put thus bluntly by Jimmy was very strong; Quisanté's
deft tongue and skilful brain could make it appear irresistible. Strategically retiring from
the ground of strict justice, he made an appeal to the feelings.

"Surely neither Mr. Quisanté himself nor any of you would wish to win through such an occurrence
as this? That would be no satisfaction to you."

"Of course we'd rather win without it," said Jimmy irritably. "It's not our fault. Go to Japhet
Williams, or, best of all, persuade Mildmay not to be a fool. Why won't he answer?"

"Have you had any talk with Quisanté about it?"

"Very little. He thinks pretty much what I've said."

"Or with Lady May?" asked the Dean with a direct glance.

"She's never mentioned it to me."

"The whole affair is deplorable."

"I don't see what we can do." Jimmy's tone was rather defiant.

The Dean fell into thought and, as the result thereof, made a proposition; it was very much
that suggestion to Quisanté on which Sir Winterton had frowned so scornfully.

"If," said he, "I could persuade Sir Winterton to give Mr. Quisanté a private assurance that
the scandal is entirely baseless, would Mr. Quisanté state publicly that he was convinced of
its falsity and did not wish it to influence the electors in any way?"

"Perhaps he would," said Jimmy.

"I think it would be only the proper thing for him to do," said the Dean rather warmly.

"I don't know about that. Why can't Mildmay say it for himself? But I'll ask Quisanté, if you
like."

The Dean was only too conscious of the weakness of his cause; he became humble again in thanking
Jimmy for this small promise. "And Mr. Quisanté'll be glad to have done it, I know, whatever
the issue of the fight may be," he ended. The remark received for answer no more than a smile
from Jimmy. Jimmy was not sure that among the stress of emotions filling Quisanté's heart in
case of defeat there would be room for any consoling consciousness of moral rectitude. Perhaps
Jimmy himself would not care much about such a solatium. He wanted to win and he wanted Quisanté
to win; such was the effect of being much with Quisanté; and in this matter at least, so far
as Jimmy's knowledge went, his champion had acted with perfect correctness. At other times
Jimmy might have been, like Sir Winterton, apt to exact something a little beyond correctness,
but now the spirit of the fight was on him.

The Dean returned with the rather scanty results of his mission, and after luncheon took his
courage in both hands and told Sir Winterton what he had done. But for his years and his station,
Sir Winterton would, at the first blush, have called him impertinent; the Dean divined the
suppressed epithet and defended himself with skill, but, alas, not without verging on the confines
of truth. To say that he had happened to meet Jimmy Benyon was to give less than its due credit
to his own ingenuity; to say that Jimmy and he had agreed on the proper thing was rather to
interpret than to record Jimmy's brief and not very sanguine utterances. However the Dean's
motive was very good, and before the meal ended Sir Winterton forgave him, while still sternly
negativing the course which his diplomacy suggested. In fact Sir Winterton was very hard to
manage; the Dean understood the Quisanté position better and better; Mrs. Baxter gave up her
efforts; she had an almost exaggerated belief in the inutility of braying fools in a mortar;
she was content to show them the mortar, and if that were not enough to leave them alone. Only
the wife persevered, for she thought neither of herself nor of what was right, but only of
what might serve her husband. To the meetings he would not speak, to Quisanté he might be got
to speak; she would not let him alone while there was a chance of it. And at last she prevailed,
not by convincing his reason (which indeed was little involved in the matter either way), not
by taming his pride, and not by pointing to his interest, but by the old illogical, perhaps
in the strictest view immoral, appeal--"For my sake, because I ask you for your love of me!"
For his love of her Sir Winterton consented to write a private note to Alexander Quisanté,
stating for his own satisfaction and for his opponent's information the outline of the true
facts of the Sinnett affair. Sir Winterton disliked his task very much but, having to do it,
he did it as he did everything, as a gentleman would, frankly, simply, cordially, with an obvious
trust in Quisanté's chivalry, good faith, and reluctance to fight with any weapons that were
not stainless.

"Now we've put it straight," said the Dean gleefully. "He's bound to mention your note and
to accept your account, and if he accepts it, his supporters can't help themselves, they must
do the same." Sir Winterton agreed that, distasteful as this quasi-appeal to his opponent had
been, it could not fail to have the beneficial results which the Dean forecast. There was more
cheerfulness at Moors End that evening than had been seen since Japhet Williams rose from the
body of the hall, a small but determined Accusing Angel.

It is not so easy to put straight what has once gone crooked, nor so safe to undertake to advise
other folks, however much the task may by habit seem to lose half its seriousness. In his heart
the Dean was thinking that he had "cornered" Quisanté, and Sir Winterton was hoping that he
had combined the advantages of pliancy with the privilege of pride. The note that Quisanté
wrote in answer did nothing to disturb this comfortable state of feeling--unless indeed any
danger were foreshadowed in the last line or two; "While, as I have said, most ready to accept
your assurance, and desirous, as I have always been, of keeping all purely personal questions
in the background, I do not feel myself called upon to express any opinion on the course which
you have, doubtless after full consideration, adopted in regard to the requests for a public
explanation which have been addressed to you by duly qualified electors of the borough." Struggle has

 His public demeanour had been
beyond reproach, and after all even persons of more delicate feeling and more exalted position
than Quisanté are apt to plume their feathers a little in the family circle.

In the whirl of these last few days there was however little time for scrutinising the fine
shades of manner or speculating on nice points of conscience. They were all worked to death,
they were all inflamed with enthusiasm and the determination to win. As was only becoming,
Quisanté's wife was the most enthusiastic and the most resolute; a thing not seeming so natural
to herself was that she was also happier than she had ever been since her marriage. As the
fight grew hotter, Quisanté grew greater in her eyes; he had less time to make postures, she
less leisure to criticise; if he forgot himself in what he was doing, she could come near to
forgetting the side of him she disliked in an admiration of the qualities that attracted her.
His praises were in men's mouths beyond Henstead; letters of congratulation came from great
folk, and Quisanté was told that his speeches had more than a local audience and more than
a local influence. Sympathy joined with admiration; he was not only successful, he was brave;
for it was a serious question whether his body and his nerves would last out, and every night
found him utterly exhausted and prostrate. Yet he never spared himself, he was wherever work
was to be done, refused no call, and surrendered not an inch to his old and hated enemy, the
physical weakness which had always hindered him. May wrote to Miss Quisanté that he was "wonderful,
wonderful, wonderful." There she paused, and added after a moment's thought, "It's something
to be his wife." And to Mr. Foster she said, "They must elect him, they can't help it, can they?"

"Well, I think we shall win now," said old Foster, smiling, but directing a rather inquisitive
glance at her. "Japhet Williams has helped us; not so much as Sir Winterton himself, though."

May's face fell a little. "I didn't mean that," she said. "Oh, I suppose I want to win anyhow,
but I'd much rather not win through that."

"Must take what we can get," murmured Foster, quite resignedly.

"I suppose so; and it's not as if my husband, or you, or any of his friends had taken any part
in it."

The inquisitive glance ceased; Foster had found out the answer to what it had asked; there
were limits to the confidence which existed between Lady May Quisanté and her husband. But
he only smiled comfortably; Quisanté wouldn't talk, he himself was safe, and, if anything had
cropped up in talk between him and Japhet, his skill and Japhet's vanity had ensured that the
little man should think himself the initiator, inventor, and sole agent in the whole affair.

"We're not responsible for Japhet Williams," said he. "His vote's safe for us now, though,
and it means a few besides his own."

"I sometimes wonder," mused May, "whether anybody at an election ever votes one way and not
the other simply because he thinks that way right and the other wrong." She laughed, adding,
"You don't get the impression that they ever do, canvassing and going about like this."

"Must allow for local feelings, Lady May."

"Yes, I know; and everybody has feelings, and I suppose every place is local. You say a lot
of people'll vote for us because Sir Winterton wouldn't let Lady Mildmay come to the town?"

"A better stroke for us than any even Mr. Quisanté has done."

"And there's something like that in every constituency, I suppose! How do we get governed even
as well as we do?"

Foster looked thoughtful and nursed his foot (in which he had a touch of the gout). "It's all
under God," he said gravely. "He turns things to account in ways we can't foresee, Lady May."
Was it possible that he was remembering the peculiar qualities of Mr. Japhet Williams? May
did not laugh, for Mr. Foster was obviously sincere, but she looked at him with surprise; his
religion came in such odd flashes across the homely tints of his worldly wisdom and placid
acceptance of things and men as he happened to find them. Henstead was not the Kingdom of Heaven,
and he did not pretend to think it wise to act on the assumption that it was. Like Quisanté,
he did not set up for being superhuman--nor set other people up for it either. May felt that
there were lessons to be learnt here; nay, that she was making some progress in them; though
she wondered now and then what Weston Marchmont would think of the lessons and of her progress
in them.

"The worst of it is," she went on, "that I'm afraid one has to say a lot of things that are
not exactly quite true."

"Truer than the other side," Mr. Foster affirmed emphatically, his corpulence seeming to give
weight to the dictum as he threw himself forward in his chair.

"Relative truth!" laughed May. "Like No. 77?"

"You must ask Mr. Quisanté about that."

"Oh, no, I won't. I'll listen to his speeches about it." She grew grave as she went on. "I've
only asked him about one thing all through the election. I had to ask him about that."

"Ah!" murmured Foster, cautiously, vaguely, safely.

"This wretched story about Sir Winterton, you know. And I got into terrible trouble by my question."
She laughed a little. "He doesn't as a rule scold me, you know, but he really did. I was very
much surprised. Fancy boring you with this! Well, I asked him if he'd had anything to do with
reviving the story. I asked him right straight out. Did you think I was like that, Mr. Foster?"

"Pretty well, pretty well," said old Foster; he was smiling, but he was watching her again.

"Was it insulting? Well, you see----" She stopped abruptly; Foster was not, after all, Aunt
Maria, and she could not tell him how it was that she might ask her husband questions that
sounded insulting. "Anyhow he was very much offended."

Foster still nursed his foot, and now he shifted a little in his chair.

"He gave me his word directly, but told me he was very much hurt at my asking him." She smiled
again. "There's a confession of a conjugal quarrel for you, Mr. Foster. Don't talk about it,
or Mr. Smiley will have a caricature of us throwing the furniture at one another. I've been
very humble ever since, I assure you."

Mr. Foster chuckled. May imagined that his fancy was touched by her suggestion of the caricature;
in fact he was picturing Alexander Quisanté's indignant disclaimer.

"Don't tell him I said anything to you about it," she added.

"You may be sure I won't," he promised.

It would not have been out of harmony with Mr. Foster's general theological position to consider
the sudden and serious development of his gout as a direct judgment on him for a diplomacy
that perhaps overstepped legitimate limits, and in another man's case he might have adopted
such a view with considerable complacency. When, however, he was laid up and placed hors du
combat in the last three critical days, he needed all his faith to reconcile him to one of
the most unfathomable instances of the workings of Providence. His grumbles were loud and long,
and the directions which he sent from his sick bed were tinged with irritability. For at last
the other side had come to its senses; Sir Winterton was affable again, Lady Mildmay was canvassing,
and Mr. Smiley had high hopes. Despondency would have fallen on Foster's spirit but for the
report of Quisanté's exploits, performed in the teeth of the orders of that same Dr. Tillman
who had given Sir Winterton such excellent unprofessional advice touching the affair of Tom
Sinnett. He gave Quisanté just as good counsel, and with just as little result. Then he tried
Quisanté's wife and found in her what he thought a hardness or an insensibility, or, if that
were an unjust view, a sort of fatalism which forbade her to seek to interfere, and reduced
her to being a spectator of her husband's doings and destiny rather than a partner in them.

"How can he lie by now?" she asked. "It's impossible; he must see this out whatever happens."
Quisanté had said exactly the same thing, but his wife's perfect agreement in it seemed strange
to the doctor. It was making the man's success more than the man; there was too much of the
Spartan wife about it, without the Spartan wife's excuse of patriotism. Something of these
feelings found expression in the look with which he regarded May, and he allowed himself to
express them more freely to Lady Mildmay, who would have disappointed the most important meeting
sooner than face the risk of Sir Winterton's taking cold. He told her how May had said, "He
won't stand being coddled," and then had added, with a frankness which the doctor had not become
accustomed to, "Besides I should never do it. We aren't in the least like that to one another."

"I felt rather sorry for the man," said the doctor. "It's as if he was a racehorse, and they
didn't think so much about him as about a win for the stable."

"Do you like him?" asked Lady Mildmay, merely in natural curiosity. But the doctor started
a little as he answered, "Why, no, I don't like him at all." And as he drove home he was thoughtful.

"Well, here we are at last!" said Jimmy Benyon as he sat down to breakfast on the morning of
the polling day. "I'm told Mildmay's people were asking for six to four last night. Where's
Quisanté?"

"He went out just before eight, to catch some of the men who work on the line and can't be
back to vote in the evening," said May.

"Lord!" sighed Jimmy in a self-reproachful tone; it was past nine now, and he was only just
out of bed. "What are you going to do?"

"Drive and bow and smile and shake hands," said May. "And you're going to and fro in a wagonette
of Mr. Williams'--without any springs, you know. And Mr. Dunn's going to take Fanny in one
of his waggons; she'll have to sit on a plank without a back all day, so I told her to stay
in bed till she has to start at ten."

"It's a devilish difficult question," said Jimmy meditatively, "whether it's all worth it,
you know."

"Oh, it's worth more than that," said May lightly, as she sprang up and put on her hat. "It's
worth--well, almost anything. Six to four? They expect us to win then?"

"By a neck, yes." He glanced at her and added rather uneasily, "They say friend Japhet's done
the trick for us." She made no answer, and he went on hastily, "Old Foster's still in bed,
and the waiter says he's written five notes to your husband already--a regular row of them
in the bar, you know."

"Last instructions?"

"Oh, somebody else to be nobbled, don't you know; some fellow who wants to marry his deceased
wife's sister--or else is afraid he'll have to if they pass the Bill. And there's the butcher
in Market Street who's got some trouble about slaughterhouses that I'm simply hanged if I can
understand. I jawed with him for half-an-hour yesterday, and then didn't hook him safe."

"Alexander must find time to go and hook him," said May, smiling. "Alexander'll be great on
slaughter-houses."

"And at the last minute Smiley's been hinting something about Mildmay giving a bit of land
to extend the Recreation Ground. A beastly unscrupulous fellow I call Smiley."

"Oh, poor Mr. Smiley! He wants to win."

"He might play fair, though."

"Might he? Oh, well, I suppose so. We've played fair anyhow--pretty fair, haven't we?"

"Rather!"

"You really think so, Jimmy?" She was serious now; Jimmy reached out his hand and touched hers
for a moment; he divined that she was asking him for a verdict and was anxious what it might be.

"Rather!" he said again. "That's all right. We've kept to the rules square enough."

"Then I'm off to bow and smile!" she cried. As she went by she touched his hand again. "Thanks,
Jimmy," she said.

Jimmy, left alone, stretched himself, sighed, and lit a cigar; they were nearly out of the
wood now, and they had managed to play pretty fair. For his own sake he was glad, since he
had been mixed up in the campaign; he had perception enough to be far more glad for May Quisanté's.

Through all the fever of that day the same gladness and relief were in her heart in a form
a thousandfold more intense. They enabled her to do her bowing and smiling, to hope eagerly,
to work unceasingly, to be gay and happy in the excitement of fighting and the prospect of
victory. She could put aside the memory of Tom Sinnett; they had not been to blame; let that
affair be set off against Smiley's hypothetical extension of the Recreation Ground. She felt
that she could face people, above all that she could face the Mildmays when the time came for
her to meet them at the declaration of the poll. And as regarded her husband she could do more
than praise and more than admire; she could feel tenderness and a touch of remorse as she saw
him battling against worse than the enemy, against a deadly weariness and weakness to which
he would not yield. From to-morrow she determined to lay to heart the doctor's counsel, to
try whether he could not be persuaded to stand a little coddling, whether he might not be brought
to, if only she could persuade herself to show him more love. When she looked at the Mildmays
she understood what had perhaps been in the doctor's mind; dear Lady Mildmay (she was a woman
who immediately claimed that epithet with its expression of mingled affection and ridicule)
no doubt overdid a little her pleasant part. She made Sir Winterton a trifle absurd. But then
with what chivalry he faced and covered the touch of absurdity, or avoided it without offending
the love that caused it! Very glad she was that, when Lady Mildmay asked to be introduced,
she could clasp hands with the consciousness that her side had played fair, and by a delicate
distant reference could honestly assure the enemy's wife that both she and her husband had
looked with disfavour on that unpleasant episode.

She had known she would like Sir Winterton and was not disappointed; she saw that he was very
favourably impressed by her, largely, no doubt, because she was handsome, even more because
their ways of looking at things would be very much the same; they had the same pride and the
same sensitiveness; in humour he was not her match, or he would not have ridden his high horse.
She felt that he complimented her in begging her to make him known to Quisanté; and this office
also she was able to perform with pleasure, because they had played fair. Hope was high in
her that night, not merely for this contest, not merely now for her husband's career, but for
her life and his, for her and him themselves. If her old fears had been proved wrong, if in
face of temptation he had not yielded, if now by honourable means he had made good his footing,
things might go better in the future, that constant terror vanish, and there be left only what
she admired and what attracted her. For they had kept to the rules square enough; Quisanté
had played fair.

She heard Sir Winterton tell him so in a friendly phrase, just touched with a pleasantly ornate
pompousness; eagerly looking, she saw Quisanté accept the compliment just as he should, as
a graceful tribute from an antagonist, as no more than his due from anyone who knew him. She
smiled to think that she could write and tell Aunt Maria that Sandro was improving, that even
his manners grew better and better as success gave him confidence, and confidence produced
simplicity. Making a friendly group with their rivals in the ante-room, they were able to forget
the little fretful man who paced up and down, carefully avoiding Sir Winterton's eye, but asserting
by the obstinate pose of his head and the fierce pucker on his brow that he had done no more
than his duty in asking a plain answer to a plain question, and that on Sir Winterton's head,
not on his, lay the consequences of evasion.

Presently the group separated. The little heaps of paper on the long table in the inner room
had grown from tens to hundreds; the end was near. Quisanté's agent stood motionless behind
the clerks who counted, Jimmy Benyon looking over his shoulder eagerly. Smiley regarded the
heaps for a moment or two and then walked across to Sir Winterton. Through the doorway May
saw Sir Winterton bend his head, listen, nod, smile, and turn and whisper to his friends. At
the next moment Jimmy Benyon came to the door, caught her eye, smiled, and nodded energetically.
The presiding officer looked down the row of men counting to right and left. "Are you all agreed
on your figures?" he asked. They exchanged papers, counted, whispered a little, recovered their
own papers. "Yes," ran along the row, and the presiding officer pushed back his chair. In a
single instant Quisanté was the centre of a throng of people shaking his hand, and everybody
crowded into the inner room.

"How many?" asked Sir Winterton Mildmay.

"Forty-seven, Sir Winterton," answered Smiley.

So it was over, and Alexander Quisanté was again Member for Henstead. "Send somebody to tell
Foster," May heard him say before he followed to the window from which the announcement was
to be made. He was very pale and walked rather unsteadily. "Stay by Mr. Quisanté; I think he's
not very well," she whispered to the agent. The next moment two of Sir Winterton's prominent
supporters passed her; one spoke to the other half in a whisper. "That damned Sinnett business
has done us," he said.

Her cheek flushed suddenly; it was horrible to think that. Still they had played fair, and
it was no fault of theirs.

"Let me be the first to congratulate you," said a gentle voice.

She turned and found Lady Mildmay beside her; Sir Winterton's wife was smiling, but there were
tears in her eyes.

"And do get your husband home to bed; he looks terribly, terribly tired. I'm afraid he's not
nearly as strong as Winterton; but I'm sure you take great care of him."

"Not so much as I ought to." Lady Mildmay, accustomed to straightforward emotions, was puzzled
at the half-bitter half-merry tone. "I mean I egg him on when perhaps I ought to hold him back.
I know he ought to rest, but I never want him to--never really want it, you know." Lady Mildmay
still looked puzzled. "He's at his best working," said May.

"Well, but you must want him to yourself sometimes anyhow, and that's a rest for him."

Oh, the differences of people and fates! That was May's not original but irresistible reflection
when Lady Mildmay left her. Want him to herself! Never--or never as Lady Mildmay meant, anyhow.
She only wanted a good place whence to look at him.

She had one more encounter before Jimmy Benyon came to take her home. Japhet Williams came
up to her and made her shake hands.

"We have got a representative in whom we can have confidence," he said.

"I hope so, Mr. Williams." She smiled to think how exactly she was speaking the truth--a rare
privilege in social intercourse.

"Don't think that I resent in any way the distant attitude which Mr. Quisanté thought it desirable
to take up in regard to my action," pursued Japhet; it seemed odd that such a coil of words
could be unrolled from so small a body. "My course was incumbent on me. I recognise that his
attitude was proper for him."

"I'm so glad, Mr. Williams," May murmured vaguely.

"I could take the course I did because I had nothing to gain by it, nothing personally. Being
personally interested, he could not have moved in the matter. I hope you see my point of view
as well as his, Lady May?"

"Oh, perfectly. I--I'm sure you're both right."

"My conscience doesn't blame me," said Japhet solemnly; and something in his manner made May
remark to Jimmy, when he came to take her home, "What a lot of excellent people are spoilt
by their consciences!"

Quisanté had disappeared, engulfed in a vortex of triumphant supporters, carried off by arms
linked in his, or perhaps hoisted in uncomfortable grandeur on enthusiastic but unsteady shoulders.
The street was densely packed, and Jimmy's apparently simple course of returning straight to
the hotel proved to be a work of much time and difficulty. But the stir of life was there,
all around them, and May's eyes grew bright as she felt it. Now at least it could not seem
a difficult question whether the result were worth the effort; triumph drove out such doubts.

"I'm so glad we've won; I'm so glad we've won," she kept repeating in simple girlish enthusiasm
as Jimmy steered her through the crowd, heading towards the Bull whenever he could make a yard
or two. "Though I'm awfully sorry for Lady Mildmay," she added once.

So long were they in getting through that on their arrival they found that Quisanté had reached
home before them. His journey had been hurried; he had been taken faint and the rejoicings
were of necessity interrupted; he was upstairs now on the sofa. May ran up, followed by Fanny
and Jimmy, passing many groups of anxious friends on the way. Quisanté was stretched in a sort
of stupor; he was quite white, his eyes were closed. She knelt down by him and called him by
his name.

"He's quite done up," said Jimmy, and he went to the sideboard and got hold of the brandy.

"Do keep everybody out," called May, and Fanny shut the door oh half-a-dozen inquisitive people.
Both she and Jimmy were looking very serious; May grew frightened when she turned and saw their
faces.

"He's only tired; he'll be all right again soon," she protested. "Give me a little brandy and
water, Jimmy."

They stood looking at her while she did her best for him; a slight surprise was in their faces;
they had never seen her minister to him before. Did she really love him? The question escaped
from Jimmy's eyes, and Fanny's acknowledged without answering it. Presently Quisanté sighed
and opened his eyes.

"Drink some of this," said his wife low and tenderly. "Do drink some." She was kneeling by
him, one arm under his shoulder, the other offering the glass.

"We've done it, haven't we?" he murmured, as she tilted the glass to his lips. The drink revived
him; with her help he hoisted himself higher on the sofa and looked at her. A smile came on
his face; they heard him whisper, "My darling!" Again it struck them both as a little strange
that he should call her that. But she smiled in answer and made him drink again.

"Yes, you've won; you always win," they heard her whisper softly. She had forgotten all now,
except that he had won, that her faith stood justified, and he lay half-dead from the work
of vindicating it. At that moment she would have been no man's if she could not be Alexander
Quisanté's.

There was a knock at the door; Jimmy Benyon went and opened it; he came back holding a note,
and gave it to May; it was addressed to her husband in a pencil scrawl. "A congratulation for
you," she said to Quisanté. He glanced carelessly and languidly at it, murmuring, "Read it
to me, please," and she broke open the sealed envelope. Inside the writing was as negligent
a scribble as on the outside, the writing of a man in bed, with a stump of pencil. Old Mr.
Foster wrote better when he was up and abroad, so much better that Quisanté's tired eyes had
not marked the hand for his. "Read it out to me," said Quisanté, his eyes now dwelling gratefully
on his wife's face, his brain at last resting from the long strain of weeks of effort.

"Yes, I'll read it," she said cheerfully, almost merrily. "We shall be full of congratulations
for days now, shan't we?"

She smoothed out the sheet of paper; there were but two or three lines of writing, and she
read them aloud. She read aloud the simple indiscreet little hymn of triumph which victory
and the safety of a private note lured from old Mr. Foster's usually diplomatic lips:--

"Just done it, thank God. Shouldn't have without Tom Sinnett, and we've got you to thank for
that idea too."

She read it all before she seemed to put any meaning into it. A silence followed her reading.
She knelt there by him, holding the sheet of note-paper in her hands. Fanny and Jimmy stood
without moving, their eyes on her and Quisanté. Slowly May rose to her feet. Quisanté closed
his eyes and moved restlessly on the sofa; he sighed and put his hand up to his head. The slightest
of smiles came on May's lips as she stood looking at him for a minute; then she turned to Fanny,
saying, "I think he'd better have a little more brandy-and-water." She walked across to the
mantelpiece, the crumpled sheet of paper in her hand. She looked at Fanny with the little smile
still on her lips as she lit a candle and burnt the note in its flame, dropping the ashes into
the grate. Quisanté lay as though unconscious, taking no heed of his sister-in-law's proffered
services. Jimmy Benyon stood in awkward stillness, looking at May. Suddenly May broke into a laugh.

"Just as well to burn it; it might be misunderstood," said she. Jimmy moved towards her quickly
and impulsively. "No, no, I'm all right," she went on. "And we've won, haven't we? I'm going
to my room. Look after him." She paused and added, smiling still, "His head's very bad, you
know." And so, pale and smiling, she left her husband to their care.

The ashes of Mr. Foster's note seemed to crinkle into a sour grin where they lay on the black-leaded
floor of the fire-grate.

                             CHAPTER XIV.

                              OPEN EYES.

It is a matter of common observation that the local influences and peculiarities which loom
so large before the eyes of both parties during such a struggle as that at Henstead seem to
be entirely forgotten after the declaration of the poll, at least by the victorious faction
and their friends in the Press and the country. Out of a congeries of conflicting views, fancies,
fads, interests, quarrels, and misunderstandings a reasoned and single political verdict is
considered to emerge, and great is the credit of the advocate who extracts it from the multitudinous
jury. When Quisanté had won Henstead, little more was heard of the gentleman with a deceased
wife's sister, of the butcher in trouble about slaughter-houses, of Japhet Williams' conscience
or Tom Sinnett's affair. Form was conceded to m when you is perhaps quisanté wife have praised

 It expressed very well her new position, how she
had abandoned those mad hopes of changing him and fallen back on the resolve to see the truth
of him herself and make the best of him to others. But the very calmness and friendliness of
the warning told him how resolutely she had chosen her path, while they concealed the shame
and the fear with which she set herself to tread it. One thing only Quisanté understood quite
clearly; it was no use acting to her any more; what she wished was that he should cease to
act to her. Yet, knowing this, he could not cease, it was not in his nature to cease, and he
went on playing his part before eyes that he knew were not imposed on but saw through all his
disguises. His old furtiveness of manner came back now when he talked over himself and his
affairs with his wife.

But even here he had his triumph, he was not at her mercy, he wielded a power of his own; she
recognised it with a smile. Like Aunt Maria, whatever she might think of him she was bound
to think constantly of him, to be occupied with his doings and his success, to want to know
what was in his mind, yes, although it might be what she hated to find there. For a while he
had withdrawn himself from her, ceasing to tell of his life, aims, and doings. If he sought
thus to bring her to terms, she proved an easy conquest; she surrendered at once, laughing
at herself and at him. "We're partners," she said, "and I must hear all about what you're doing.
I can't live without that, you know." And as the price of what she must have she gave him friendship,
sympathy, and comradeship, crossing his wishes in nothing and never allowing herself to upbraid
except in that small tacit jeer of Mr. Foster's picture on the mantelpiece. For now she believed
herself to know the worst, and yet to be able to endure.

What sort of life promised to form itself out of this state of affairs? For after all she was
at the beginning of life, and he hardly well into the middle of his. Neither of the two obvious
things seemed possible; devotion was out of the question, alienation was forbidden by her unconquerable
interest in him and his irrepressible instinct to hold her mind, even if he could not chain
her affections. Perhaps a third thing was more usual still, tolerance. But for her at least
neither was tolerance the mood, for that is ill to build out of a mixture of intense admiration
and scornful contempt. These seemed likely to be the predominant features of her life with
her husband, sharing it so equally that the one could never drive out the other nor yet come
to fair terms and, dividing the territory, live at peace.

"Perhaps they will some day," she thought, "when I get old and quiet." She was neither old
nor quiet now, and her youth cried out against so poor a consolation. Then she told herself
that she had the child, only to reproach herself, a moment later, with the insincere repetition
of a commonplace. The child was not enough; had her nature been such as to find the child enough,
she would certainly never have become Alexander Quisanté's wife. Always when she was most strongly
repelled by him, there was in the back of her mind the feeling that it was something to be
his wife. Only--he mustn't be found out. The worst terror of all, at which her half-jesting
words to Marchmont had hinted, came back as she murmured, "I wish we had more money." For money
was necessary, as votes had been, and--her eyes strayed to old Foster's portrait on the mantelpiece.
The election had cost a lot; no salary was to be looked for now; both by policy and by instinct
Quisanté was lavish; she herself had no aptitude for small economies. Money was wanted very
much indeed in Grosvenor Road.

It was on the way, though. This was the news that Quisanté, in the interval between his return
from electioneering and the meeting of Parliament, brought back day by day from his excursions
to the City and his conversations with Mandeville. He was careful to explain to his wife that
he was no "guinea-pig," that he did not approve of the animal, and would never use his position
to pick up gain in that way. But he had leisure--at least he could make time--and some of it
he proposed to devote to starting a really legitimate and highly lucrative undertaking. The
Alethea Printing Press was to revolutionise a great many things besides the condition of Quisanté's
finances; it was not an ordinary speculative company. Marchmont's phrase came in here, and
May used it neatly and graciously. Quisanté, much encouraged, plunged into an account of the
great invention; if only it worked as it was certain to work, there was not one fortune but
many fortunes in it. "And it will work?" she asked. "If we can get the capital," he answered
with a confident air. "I shall try to interest all my friends in it," he went on. "You can
help me there." May looked doubtful, and Quisanté grew more eloquent. At last he held up a
sheaf of papers, saying triumphantly,

"Here are favourable reports from all the leading experts. We shall have an array of them in
the prospectus. Of course they're absolutely impartial, and they really leave no room for doubt."
He held them out to her, but she leant back with her hands in her lap.

"I shouldn't understand them," she protested. "But they all agree, do they?"

"Yes, all," he said emphatically. "Well, all except one." His brow wrinkled a little. "Mandeville
insisted on having an opinion from Professor Maturin. I was against it. Maturin's absurdly
pessimistic."

"He's a great man, isn't he?"

"Oh, yes, I suppose so,--he's got a great reputation anyhow."

"And he's against you?"

"The fact is that his is only--only a draft report. So far as it goes, it's not encouraging,
but he's never had the facts really laid before him."

"You'd better go and lay them before him," she said very gravely.

Quisanté caught eagerly at the suggestion.

"Exactly what I proposed to Mandeville!" he cried. "The prospectus won't be out for nearly
a month yet, and I shall go and see Maturin. I know----" He rose and began to walk about. "I
know Maturin is wrong, and I know that I can show him he's wrong. I only want an hour with
him to bring him round to my view, to the true view."

"Well, why haven't you been to see him?"

"I tried to go, but he's ill and not equal to business. As soon as he gets better I shall go.
To put his report in as it stands would not only do us infinite harm--in fact we couldn't think
of it--but it wouldn't be just to him."

"But if he won't change his opinion?"

"Oh, he must, he will. I tell you it's as plain as a pikestaff, when once it's properly explained."

"I'm sure you'll be able to convert him, if anyone can," said May soothingly.

"I must," said Quisanté briefly, and sat down to his papers again.

For an hour or two he worked steadily, without a pause, without an apparent hesitation. That
fine machine of his was ploughing its straight unfaltering way through details previously unfamiliar
and through problems which he had never studied. From five to seven she sat with a book in
her hands, feigning to read, really watching her husband. He could not fail, she said to herself;
he would make the Alethea Printing Press a success, irrespective of the actual merits of it.
Was that possible? It seemed almost possible as she looked at him.

"It's bound to go," he said at last, pushing away the papers. "I'm primed now, and I can convince
old Maturin in half an hour." He held up the Professor's report. "He must withdraw this and
give us another."

Alas, there are things before which even will and energy and brains must bow. As he spoke the
servant came in, bringing the Evening Standard. May took it, glanced at the middle page, and
then, with a little start, looked across at her husband. He saw her glance. "Any news?" he asked.

"The Professor can't be convinced," she said. "His illness took a sudden turn for the worse
last night and he died this afternoon at three o'clock."

Quisanté sat quite still for a few minutes, the dead Professor's report on the Alethea Printing
Press still in his fingers.

"What'll you do now?" she asked, with the smile of curiosity which she always had ready for
his plans. Would he pursue the Professor beyond Charon's stream?

He hesitated a little, glancing at her rather uneasily. At last he spoke.

"One thing at all events is clear to me," he said. "This thing doesn't represent a reasoned
and well-informed opinion." He folded it up carefully and placed it by itself in a long envelope.
"We must consider our course," he ended.

In a flash, by an instinct, May knew what their course would be and at whose dictation it would
be followed.

"Of course," said Quisanté, "all this is strictly between ourselves."

Her cheek flushed a little. "You mustn't tell me any more business secrets. I don't like them,"
said she, and she turned away to escape the quick, would-be covert glance that she knew he
would direct at her.

Money was necessary; votes had been necessary; old Foster smiled in fat shrewdness from the
mantelpiece. May Quisanté was less sure that she knew the worst.

                             CHAPTER XV.

                           A STRANGE IDEA.

The next few weeks were a time of restless activity with Alexander Quisanté. Again he was like
an electric current, not travelling now from constituency to constituency, but between Westminster
and his cousin Mandeville's offices in the City. In both places he was very busy. His leader
had declared for a waiting policy, and an interval in which the demoralisation of defeat should
pass away; the party must feel its feet again, the great man said. Constantine Blair was full
of precedents for the course, quoting Lord Melbourne, Sir Robert Peel, Sir James Graham, and
all the gods of the Parliamentarian. Brusquely and almost rudely Quisanté brushed him, his
gods, and his leader on one side, and raised the standard of fierce and immediate battle. The
majority was composite; his quick eye saw the spot where a wedge might be inserted between
the two component parts and driven home till the gap yawned wide and scission threatened. The
fighting men needed only to be shown where to fight; they followed enthusiastically the man
who led them to the field. Leaders shook grey heads, and leader-writers disclaimed a responsibility
which primá facie had never rested on them; Quisanté was told that he would wreck the party
for a quarter of a century to come. It would perhaps have been possible to meet Constantine
Blair's precedents with other precedents, to quote newer gods against his established deities.
That was not "Sandro's way"; here again he was content to be an ancestor, the originator of
his methods, and the sufficient authority for them.

He was justified. The spirit of his fighting men ran high, and his fighting men's wives grew
gracious to him. The majority, if they scowled at him (as was only to be hoped), began to scowl
furtively at one another also and to say that certain questions, on which they were by no means
of one mind, could not permanently be shirked and kept in the background. Some of them asked
what their constituents had sent them to Westminster for, a question always indicative of perturbation
in the parliamentary mind; in quiet times it is not raised. The Government papers took to observing
that they did not desire to hurry or embarrass the Government, but that time was running on
and it would be no true friendship to advise it to ignore the feeling which existed among an
important, if numerically small, section of its followers. Altogether at the opening of the
session the majority was much less happy, the minority in far finer feather, than anybody had
expected. Only officialdom or ignorance could refuse the main credit to Alexander Quisanté.

"I declare," said Lady Castlefort--and her opinion was not one to neglect--"May Gaston was
right to take the man after all. He'll be Prime Minister." And she settled her pince-nez and
looked round for contradiction. She loved argument but had made the mistake of growing too
important to be differed from. None the less on this occasion a sweet little voice spoke up
in the circle.

"I wouldn't marry him if he were fifty times Prime Minister," said Lady Richard Benyon. "He's
odious."

"God bless me!" murmured the Countess, genuinely startled. "Well, you'll see, my dear," she
went on, nodding emphatically. "He's the only man among them." Her eye fell on Weston Marchmont.
"Oh, yes, I see you're there," she said, "and I'm very glad you should be."

"It's always a pleasure to be here," he smiled urbanely.

"Especially, apparently, when you ought to be at the House," she retorted, glancing at the
clock. "However to-day you've heard more truth here than you're likely to there, so I forgive you."

"More truth here? But Quisanté's making a speech!"

"Oh, you're very neat," she said with an open impatience. "You can score off a woman at her
tea-table; go and score off the other side, Weston, and then you may do it as much as you like
to me. As if anybody cared whether Mr. Quisanté speaks the truth or not!" He came up to her
and held out his hand, smiling good-naturedly. She gave him hers with a laugh, for she liked
him much and did not like Quisanté at all. "It's your own fault, that's why you're so exasperating,"
she half-whispered as she bade him good-bye.

Here was one side; on the other the men of the City came to know Quisanté too, but, as befitted
persons engaged in the serious pursuit of dealing with money, gave more hesitating and guarded
opinions; no party spirit led them astray or fired them to desperate ventures. However there
was no denying that the Alethea Printing Press sounded a very good thing, and moreover no denying
that measures had been skilfully taken to prevent anybody having a share in that good thing
without paying handsomely for the privilege. The Syndicate, speaking through Mr. Mandeville
its mouthpiece, by no means implored support or canvassed new partners; it was prepared to
admit one or two names of weight in return for substantial aid. Mandeville did nothing of himself;
he referred to the Board, and the Board's answers came after Alexander Quisanté's hansom had
flashed back to Westminster. But a few did gain admittance, and these few were much struck
by the reports on the Alethea, all of which had been sent back for revision to their respective
authors, accompanied by some new and important facts. These latter did not, as it turned out,
alter the tenor of the reports, but it had been thought as well to afford an opportunity for
reconsideration in the light of them; so Mandeville explained, seeming always just a little
nervous over this matter of the reports.

"We had hoped," he said to one gentleman who was rather important and rather hard to satisfy,
"to fortify ourselves with Professor Maturin's opinion. But unfortunately he died before he
could complete his examination, and nothing on the subject was found among his papers."

"That's a pity. Maturin would have carried great weight."

"We were quite alive to that," Mandeville assured him with a somewhat uneasy smile. His feelings
were not unlike those of a quiet steady-going member of Quisanté's party in Parliament. "We
have no doubt of what his opinion would have been, had he been able to study our additional
facts and been spared to complete his report. As it was, he had only discussed the matter informally
with one or two of us." And when he was left alone, he murmured softly, "I suppose that's how
Alexander meant me to put it." But he rather wished that Alexander had been there to put it
himself.

It is perhaps needless to say that Aunt Maria, sturdily fulfilling her destiny in life, was
deeply concerned in the fortunes of the Alethea Printing Press. But large as was her stake--and
the possibilities of loss at least were for her very large--she was not disturbed; she said
that heaven alone knew whether there was anything in the thing, but that she knew that Sandro
would make people think there was. Nor did she share in any serious degree the fears which
afflicted her nephew's wife; Sandro always had a case, and she did not doubt that he would
have a very good one whereby to justify any proceedings he might take in regard to the Alethea.
So she lived frugally, hoped magnificently, and came often to Grosvenor Road to pick up what
crumbs of information she could. Here she met Lady Castlefort and nodded her rusty bonnet at
that great personage with the remark that she was glad people were waking up to what there
was in Sandro; it was time, goodness knew. Lady Castlefort was for the moment taken aback.

"Mr. Quisanté has had certain--er--difficulties to overcome," she murmured rather vaguely,
and was not reassured by a dry chuckle and the heartfelt exclamation, "I should think so!"
Altogether it was difficult to make out exactly what Mr. Quisanté's aunt thought of him.

Here the old lady met also the Dean of St. Neot's, who called every now and then because he
liked May and wished to show that he bore no malice about the Crusade; but the subject was
still a sore one, and he was as little prepared to be chuckled at over it as Lady Castlefort
had been over her diplomatic indication of the fact that Quisanté's blood was not blue nor
his manners those of a grand old English gentleman.

"Sandro knew all along that there wasn't much in that, but it was something to begin with,"
Aunt Maria remarked to the uncomfortable Dean. She herself had dragged in the Crusade, to which
she referred so contemptuously.

"Miss Quisanté will do anything in the world for my husband," May interposed, "but nothing'll
persuade her to say a good word for him."

"As long as that's understood, she does him no harm. We discount all you say, Miss Quisanté."

The Dean's affability was thrown away on Aunt Maria.

"I know what I'm talking about," she remarked grimly, "and as far as your Crusade goes, I should
think you'd have seen it yourself by now."

The Dean had seen it himself by now, but he did not wish to say so in the presence of Quisanté's
wife. May's laugh relieved him a little.

"The Dean's very forgiving," she said, "and Alexander's doing well now, anyhow, isn't he?"

The Dean agreed that he was doing well now--for in spite of his disclaimers of partisanship
there was a spice of the fighting man in the Dean--and repeated Lady Castlefort's prophecy,
reported to him by Lady Richard. The rusty black bonnet nodded approvingly. "I knew that was
a sensible woman, in spite of her airs," said Miss Quisanté.

Lastly, among those whom Miss Quisanté encountered at her nephew's house was Lady Mildmay,
and this interview took a rather more serious turn. In after days May used to look back to
it as the first faint sign of the new factor which from now began to make itself felt in her
life and to become a very pressing presence to her. She did not enjoy the friendship which
the Mildmays forced on her, but it was impossible to receive it otherwise than with outward
graciousness; the cordiality was so kind, the interest so frank, Sir Winterton's gallantry
so chivalrous, his wife's gentleness so appealing. When Lady Mildmay was announced May found
time for a hasty whisper to Aunt Maria: "Take care what you say about Alexander before her."
Doubts must not be stirred in the Mildmay mind; the Mildmays must be kept in their delusion;
to help in this was one of the duties of Quisanté's wife.

Lady Mildmay smiled gladly on Aunt Maria.

"I'm so pleased you're here," she said, "because I know you'll second me in what I'm going
to venture to say to Lady May. I know I'm taking a liberty, but I can't help it. Meeting people
now and then, you do sometimes see what people who are always with them don't. Now don't you,
Miss Quisanté?"

"And vice versâ," murmured Aunt Maria; but May's eye rested on her warningly, and she refrained
from pointing her observation by any reference to Sandro.

"I'm quite sure your husband is overdoing himself terribly," Lady Mildmay went on. "I saw him
the other day walking through the Park, and he looked ghastly. I stopped him and told him so,
but he said he'd just been to his doctor, and that there was really nothing the matter with him."

"I didn't know he'd been to the doctor lately. He seemed pretty well for him," said May. Aunt
Maria said nothing; her keen little eyes were watching the visitor very closely.

"I've seen a lot of illness," pursued Lady Mildmay in her gentle voice, "and I know. He's working
himself to death; he's killing himself." She raised her eyes and looked at May. Kind as the
glance was, May felt in it a wonder, almost a reproach. "How comes it that you, his wife, haven't
seen it too?" the eyes seemed to say in plaintive surprise. "Are you sure there's nothing wrong
with him?" she asked.

"Wrong with him? What do you mean?" The question was Aunt Maria's, asked abruptly, roughly,
almost indignantly. Lady Mildmay started. "I--I don't want to alarm you, I'm sure," she murmured,
"but I don't like his looks. Do, do persuade him to take a rest."

Both of them were silent now; Lady Mildmay's wonder grew; she did not understand them; she
saw them exchange a glance whose expression she could not analyse.

"He wants absolute rest and care, the care you could give him, my dear," she said to May--such
a care she meant as her loving heart and hands would give to handsome Sir Winterton. "Go away
with him for a few months and take care of him, now do. Keep all worries and--and ambitions
and so on away from him."

May's face was grave and strained in a painful attention; but on Miss Quisanté's lips there
came slowly a bitter little smile. What a picture this good lady drew of Sandro and his loving
wife, together, apart from the world, with ambitions and worries set aside! Must the outlines
of that picture be followed if--well, if Sandro was to live?

"I hope you're not offended? Seeing him only now and then I notice the change. Winterton and
I have both been feeling anxious about it, and we decided that you wouldn't mind if I spoke
to you."

"You're too good, too good," said May. "We don't deserve it." Lady Mildmay smiled.

"I know what a strain the election was," said she. "Even Winterton felt it, and Mr. Quisanté
never seems to rest, does he?" She rose to go, but, as she said good-bye, she spoke one more
word, half in a whisper and timidly, "I daresay I'm wrong, but are you sure his heart's quite
sound?" And so she left them, excusing herself to the last for what might seem an intrusion,
or even a slight on the careful watch that an affectionate wife keeps over her husband's health.

May walked to the hearthrug and stood there; Aunt Maria, sitting very still, glanced up with
a frightened gaze, but her speech came bitter with aggressive scorn.

"What does the silly creature mean?" she asked. "There's nothing the matter with Sandro, is there?"

"I don't know that there is," May answered slowly.

"The woman talks as if he was going to die." Still the tone was contemptuous, still the look
frightened. "Such nonsense!"

"I hope it is. He's not strong though, is he?"

Miss Quisanté had often said the same, but now she received the remark irritably. "Strong!
He's not a buffalo like some men, like Jimmy Benyon or, I suppose, that poor creature's husband
she's always talking about. But there's nothing the matter with him, there's no reason he shouldn't--no
reason he should fall ill at all."

"She thinks he ought to rest, perhaps give up altogether."

"Altogether? Nonsense!" The tone was sharp.

"Well, then, for a long while."

"And go away, and let you coddle him?"

"Yes, and let me coddle him." May looked down on Aunt Maria, and for the first time smiled faintly.

"The woman's out of her senses," declared Aunt Maria testily. "Don't you think so? Don't you
think so?"

"I don't know," was all May could say in answer either to the irritation of the voice or to
the fear of the eyes. The old lady's hands were trembling as she raised them and gave a pull
to the bow of her bonnet-strings.

"He'll see me out anyhow, I'll be bound," she said obstinately. She was fighting against the
bare idea of being left with a remnant of life to live and no Sandro to fill it for her; what
a miserable fag-end of empty waiting that would be! She glanced sharply at his wife; she did
not know what his wife was thinking of.

"I'll ask him," said May, "and I must insist on knowing." She paused and added, "I ought to
have noticed and I ought to have asked before. But somehow----" The sentence went unfinished,
and Aunt Maria's sharp unsatisfied eyes drew no further answer. May kissed her when they parted;
whatever this idea might mean to her, whatever the strange tumult it might raise in her, she
read well enough the story of the old lady's rough tones, shaking hands and frightened eyes.
To the old woman Sandro was the sum of life. She might sneer, she might scorn, she might rail,
she might and would suffer at his hands. But he was the one thing, the sole support, she had
to cling to; he kept her alive. Yet the last words that Miss Quisanté said were, "I expect
Sandro wanted to wheedle something out of that woman, and has been playing one of his tricks
to get a bit of sympathy." Then she climbed slowly and totteringly down the stairs.

Left alone, May Quisanté sat in apparent idleness, letting her thoughts play with a freedom
which some people consider in itself blameworthy, though certainly no action and often no desire
accompany the picture which the mind draws. She said to herself, "Supposing this is true, or
that more than this is true, supposing his heart is unsound, what does it mean to me?" What
it excluded was easier to realise than what it meant. Unless Quisanté were to have not existence
only, but also health, such health at least as enables a man to do work although not, may be,
to glory in the doing of it, unless there were to the engine wheels sound enough to answer
to the spur of the steam that his brain's furnace made, nothing could come about of what Lady
Castlefort's Mightiness prophesied, nothing of what friends and enemies had begun to look for,
nothing of what May herself had grown to regard as his future and hers, as the basis, the condition,
the circumstances, of her life and of his. An old thought of her own came to her, back from
the dim region of ante-marriage days, the idea to which the Henstead doctor had given a terse,
if metaphorical, expression. Quisanté was their race-horse, their money was on him, they wanted
a win for the stable. If this or more than this were true, then there would be no win for the
stable; the horse was a grand horse, but he wouldn't stand training. What was left then? An
invalid and the wife of an invalid, coddlings, cossetings, devotion, ambition far away, life
kept in him by loving heart and loving hands. Hers must be the heart and the hands. Hers also
were the keen eyes that knew every weakness, every baseness, of the man to whom heart and hands
must minister, but would see no more the battle and the triumph and the brilliance which set
them sparkling and seemed to make the world alight for them.

For a little while the third thing, the remaining possibility, was unformulated in her thoughts;
perhaps she had a scruple which made her turn away from it. But her speculations would not
be denied their irresponsible freedom of ranging over all the field of chance. If it were true,
if more than it, more than the kind timid woman had dared to say, were true, he might die.
He might die, not in some dim far-off time when nature made the thing seem inevitable, when
he had lived his life, been Prime Minister and so forth, and she had lived hers, filling it
with work for him, and with looking on at him and with endurance of him, but sooner, much sooner,
almost now, when he had not lived his life, while hers was not exhausted, when there would
still be left to her another of her own to live after he was gone. It was strange to think
of that, to see how what had seemed to be irrevocable and for ever, to stretch in unfaltering
perpetuity to the limits of old age, might so easily, by the occasion of so small a matter
as a heart not sound, turn out to be a passing thing, and there come to her again freedom,
choice, a life to be re-made. If that happened, how would she feel? At the new-learnt chance
of that happening, how did she feel? Very strange, very bewildered, very upset; that was her
answer. Such a thing--Quisanté's death she meant--would mean so much, change so much, take
away so much--and might give so much. Her thoughts flew off to the new life that she might
live then, to the new freedom from embarrassments, from fears and from disgusts, to a new love
which it might be hers to gain and to enjoy. People said that it was always impossible to go
back--vestigia nulla. But that event would open to her a sort of going back, such a return
to her old life and her surroundings as might some day make the time she had spent with Quisanté
and its experiences seem but an episode, studding the belt of long days with one strange bizarre
ornament.

And on the other side? There was the greatest difficulty, the greatest puzzle. She had not
failed to understand the roughness of Aunt Maria's tones, her frightened eyes and the shaking
of her hands. It would be very strange to see an end of him, to know that he would never be
Prime Minister and so forth, to look on at a world devoid of him, to live a life in which he
was only a memory. How were the scales to be held, which way did the balance incline? She could
not tell, and at last she smiled at her inability to answer the riddle. It would amuse people
so much, and shock some people so much and doubtless so properly, if they knew that she was
sitting in her drawing-room in the afternoon, trying to make up her mind whether she would
rather her husband lived or that he died. Even there the fallacy crept in; she was not desiring
either way; she was simply looking at the two pictures which the two events painted for her
fancy; and she did not know which picture she preferred. So all was still bewilderment, all
still rocking from the sudden gust that had proceeded out of dear Lady Mildmay's gentle lips.
But the undercurrent of wonder and of reproach that there had been in the warning May Quisanté
now almost missed. By an effort at last she realised its presence, the naturalness of it, and
its rightness. But still it seemed to her a little conventional, something that might be supposed
to be appropriate, but was not, if the truth were faced. "Alexander and I have never been like
that to one another--at least never for more than a very little while," was the form her thought
about it took.

When he came in that evening, she found herself looking at him with wonder, and with a sort
of scepticism about what her visitor had said. He seemed so full of life; it was impossible
to think of him as being likely, or even able, to die. But she had made up her mind to open
the subject to him, to force something from him, and to learn about this visit to the doctor
which he had so studiously concealed from her. She gave him tea, and was so far affected by
her mood as to show unusual kindness towards him, or rather to let her uniform friendliness
be tinged by an affection which was not part of her habitual bearing; with the help of this
she hoped to lead up to a subject which her own strangely mixed meditations somehow made it
hard for her to approach. But Quisanté also had a scheme; he also was watching and working
for an opportunity, and seeing one now in her great cordiality of manner he seized it with
his rapid decisiveness, cutting in before his wife had time to develop her attack. He pressed
her hand as she gave him his cup, sighed as though in weariness, took a paper from his pocket,
and laid it on the table, giving it a tentative gentle push in the direction of her chair.

"We've got the Alethea afloat at last," he said. "There's the prospectus, if you care to look
at it." With this he glanced at the clock, sighed again and added, "I must be at the House
early this evening. By Jove, I'm tired though!" This little odd ineradicable trick of his made
May smile; he was never so tired as when he had a risky card to play; then, indeed, he affected
for his purposes some sort of reconcilability with those incongruous ideas of collapse and
mortality that Lady Mildmay had suggested. He inspired May, as he did sometimes now, with a
malicious wish to make him show himself at his trickiest. Fingering the prospectus carelessly,
she asked,

"I suppose it sets out all the wonderful merits of the Alethea, doesn't it? Well, I've heard
a good deal about them. I don't think I need read it."

"It gives a full account of the invention," said Quisanté, wearily passing his hand across
his brow.

"Have you put in Professor Maturin's report?" She was not looking at him, but smiling over
to Mr. Foster on the mantelpiece. There was a moment's pause.

"The facts about Maturin are fully stated. You'll find it on the third page." He rose with
a sigh and threw himself on the sofa; he groaned a little and shut his eyes. May glanced at
him, smiled, and turned to the third page.

"In addition to the foregoing very authoritative opinions, steps were taken to obtain a report
from the late Professor Maturin, F.R.S. Professor Maturin was very favourably impressed with
several features of the invention, and was about to pursue his investigations with the aid
of further information furnished to him, when he was unfortunately attacked by the illness
of which he recently died. The Directors therefore regret to be unable to present any report
of his examination. But they have every reason to believe that his opinion would have been
no less encouraging than those of the other gentlemen consulted."

May turned back to the list of directors. Three out of the six she did not know; the other
three were Quisanté himself, Jimmy Benyon, and Sir Winterton Mildmay. The presence of these
two last names filled May with a feeling of helplessness; this was worse than she had expected.
Of course neither Jimmy nor Sir Winterton had heard anything about the Maturin report; of the
other three she knew nothing and took no thought. Jimmy, not warned, alas, by that affair of
old Foster's note, and Sir Winterton, in the chivalrous confidence of perfect trust, had given
their support to Quisanté. The use he made of their names was to attach them to a statement
which she who knew of the Maturin report could describe only in one way. She looked round at
her husband's pale face and closed eyes.

"I thought you were supposed to tell the--I mean, to state all the facts in a prospectus?"
she said.

Quisanté sat up suddenly, leant forward, and spread his hands out. "My dear May," he replied
with a smile, "the facts are stated, stated very fully."

"There's nothing about the report the Professor did give. You remember you told me about it?"

"Oh, no, he gave no report."

"Well, you called it a draft report."

"No, no, did I? That was a careless way of speaking if I did. He certainly sent me some considerations
which had occurred to him at the beginning of his inquiry, but they were based on insufficient
information and were purely provisional. They did not in any sense constitute a report. It
would have been positively misleading to speak of them in any such way." He was growing eager,
animated, almost excited.

May was not inclined to cross-examine him; she knew that he would develop his case for himself
if she sat and listened.

"The whole thing was so inchoate as to be worth nothing," he went on. "We simply discarded
it from our minds; we didn't let it weigh one way or the other."

"The directors didn't?" That little question she could not resist asking.

"Oh, it was never laid before them. As I tell you, Mandeville and I decided that it could not
be regarded as a report, or even as an indication of Maturin's opinion. We only referred to
Maturin at all because--because we wanted to be absolutely candid."

May smiled; absolute candour resulted, as it seemed to her, in giving rise to an impression
that the Professor had been in favour of the merits of the Alethea.

"And you won't show it to the directors?"

"No," said Quisanté, "certainly not." He paused for a moment and then added slowly, "In fact
it has not been preserved. What is stated there is based on my own personal discussions with
the Professor, and on Mandeville's; the few lines he wrote added nothing."

It had not been preserved; it had sunk from a report to a draft report, from a draft report
to considerations, from considerations to a few lines which added nothing; the minimising process,
pursued a little further, had ended in a total disappearance. And nobody knew that it had ever
existed, even as considerations, even as a few lines adding nothing, except her husband, cousin
Mandeville, and herself.

"If the Professor himself," Quisanté resumed, "had considered it of any moment, he would have
kept a copy or some memorandum of it; but there was not a word about it among his papers."

There was safety, then, so far as the Professor was concerned; and so far as Quisanté was concerned;
of course, also, so far as cousin Mandeville was concerned. But Quisanté's restless eyes seemed
to ask whether there were perfect safety all round, no possibility of Jimmy or Sir Winterton
or anybody else picking up false ideas from careless talk about the few lines in which the
Professor had added nothing. For an instant May's eyes met his, and she understood what he
asked of her. She was to hold her tongue; that sounded simple. She had held her tongue before,
and thus it happened that Sir Winterton was her husband's friend and trusted him. Now she was
again to be a party to deceiving him, and this time Jimmy Benyon was to be hoodwinked too.
She was to hold her tongue; if by any chance need arose, she was to lie. Each awareness, which is

 Many an amazed secret stare and many
a sour smile his eulogies drew from cousin Mandeville; for even in his enthusiasm Sir Winterton
praised with discrimination; it was the sterling worth, the heart of the man, that he admired;
shallow people stuck at superficial defects of manner; not such was Sir Winterton. "I trust
him as I do myself," he used to say to Lady Mildmay, and she, in honest joy, posted off with
the testimonial to May Quisanté; besides she was eager to seize a chance of throwing out another
hint or two about Quisanté's health.

The Alethea, at least, seemed to be going to prove worthy of these laudations. There really
had, it appeared, been some good reason why the Professor should reconsider his considerations.
The invention stood the test of criticism and experiment; it saved a lot of expense; the idea
got about more and more that it was an uncommonly good thing; the two or three papers which
were inquisitive about the actual views of the Professor were treated with disdain (one with
advertisements also) and their clamour went almost unnoticed. There was a demand for the shares.
Sir Winterton pointed out to Weston Marchmont what a mistake he had committed in not accepting
the offer of an allotment which had been made to him.

"The only thing for which I value independent means," said Marchmont, "is that they relieve
me from the necessity of imposing on the public. I suppose my ancestors did it for me."

Sir Winterton laughed serenely. "We're serving the public," said he. Then he remembered the
new man of business in him, and added, with a slyness obvious from across the street, "Oh,
and ourselves too, ourselves too, I admit that."

"And you, Jimmy?" asked Marchmont, turning to him; they made a group of three at the club.

"I don't think Quisanté'll go far wrong," said Jimmy. "You know Dick's gone in too?"

"What, after the Crusade?"

"This is another sort of game," said Jimmy, with a grim smile; he had gone in after both the
Crusade and the Sinnett affair. He turned to Sir Winterton; "Old Foster of Henstead's in it
too; he's pretty wide-awake, you know."

"Oh, we Henstead fellows have heads on our shoulders," said Sir Winterton, but he looked a
little less happy; he had never acquitted Foster with the confidence that Quisanté had won
from him.

"And you'll grow rich against your wedding, Jimmy?" asked Marchmont.

Again Jimmy smiled. The wedding was near now, and the next day he was going to Ashwood to meet
Fanny Gaston.

"You're going to Dick's on Friday, aren't you?" he said to Marchmont.

"I believe I am."

"Ah, then you shall hear about our show from Quisanté himself."

"What?" Weston Marchmont's tone expressed surprise rather than pleasure.

"May's going to be there, and he's coming for the Sunday. Amy fought hard, but Dick said he
must come, because he was going to be a connection." Jimmy's slow smile endured all through
this speech; he had a sense of humour which he treated gravely.

"I didn't know he was coming," said Marchmont. Sir Winterton broke into a hearty laugh.

"You're the most prejudiced fellow in the world, Marchmont," he said. "I tell you what, though,"
he went on. "Do persuade Lady May to take care of her husband, or get him to take care of himself.
My wife's been at her again and again, but nothing's done. The man's not well, he'll break
up if they aren't careful." He paused, and a puzzled look came over his handsome candid face.
"If I was half as bad as he is, my wife'd have me in bed or off to the seaside in a jiffy,"
he ended.

The silence that followed struck him much as May's and Aunt Maria's had struck his wife. Neither
he nor his wife were accustomed to the way in which people who knew Quisanté close at hand
came to stand towards him.

"I suppose Lady May's not what you'd call a very domestic woman?" he hazarded. "Charming, most
charming, but full of politics and that sort of thing, eh?"

To Weston Marchmont it seemed simplest to laugh and say, "I suppose so." Sir Winterton's mind
had need of categories, and was best not burdened with the complexities of an individual. But
Jimmy was not so wise.

"I don't think she cares a hang about politics, except so far as Quisanté's concerned in them,"
he said.

Sir Winterton looked more puzzled still. "Nothing's any good unless he keeps his health," he
murmured. He was uncomfortable; he liked May very much, and did not welcome the thought of
there being any truth in the idea of indifference and carelessness about her husband at which
Lady Mildmay had sorrowfully hinted. "That's his wife's first business anyhow," he ended, a
trifle defiantly. But his challenge was not taken up by either of his friends. He went home
with his high spirits rather dashed.

On the Friday Marchmont found himself travelling down to Ashwood in company with Mr. Morewood.
The painter had an extreme fit of his mocking acidity; he refrained his tongue from nobody
and showed no respect for what might be guessed to be delicate points with his companion. Quisanté's
success was his principal theme; he exhibited it in its four aspects, political, social, commercial,
and matrimonial.

"I've talked," he said, "to Constantine Blair, to Lady Castlefort, to Winterton Mildmay, and
to Jimmy Benyon. There's nothing left for all of us but to fall down and worship. On to your
knees with the rest of us, my friend! In every relation of life the man is great. You'll say
he's objectionable. Quite so. Greatness always is. You're still pleasant, because you haven't
become great."

"A few people think you a great artist."

"Quite a few," grinned Morewood. "I can still set up for being pleasant."

This mood did not leave him with his arrival at Ashwood. He reminded Marchmont of a monkey
who had some trick to play, and grinned and chattered in anticipation of his cruel fun; his
smile was most mocking when he greeted May Quisanté. She was in high spirits; girlish gaiety
marked a holiday mood in her. Morewood seemed to encourage it with malicious care, letting
it grow that he might strike at it with better effect later on. Yet what did the man know,
what could he do? And though Dick Benyon winced at his darts, and Jimmy grew a little sulky,
May herself seemed unconscious of them. She was ready to meet him in talk about her husband
and her husband's plans; she laughed at his jibes in all the apparent security of a happy confidence.
Such a state of things exactly suited Lady Richard; she would not wish May to be pained, but
she enjoyed infinitely any legitimate "dig" at her old enemy. May fought with equal gallantry
and good temper.

"Success is our crime," she said gaily at dinner. "Mr. Morewood can't forgive it. You call
us Philistines now, I expect, don't you?"

"Philistines in the very highest degree," he nodded.

"I know," she cried. "The only really cultivated thing is to fail elegantly."

"Let's bow our acknowledgments," Morewood called across to Marchmont.

"Oh, no, Mr. Marchmont isn't like that. He doesn't even try. Well, perhaps that's still more
superior." She smiled at Marchmont, shaking her head. "But we try, we try everything."

The "we" grated still on Marchmont's feelings, and the worse because it seemed to come more
easily and naturally from her lips. Yet that might be only the result of practice; she had
looked at him in a merry defiance as the last words left her lips.

"And you get other people to try your things too," pursued Morewood.

"Look here, you don't mean me, do you?" Jimmy Benyon put in. "Because I'm not trying Fanny;
on the contrary, she's trying me."

"What, already?" asked Dick with exaggerated apprehension. "What'll it be when you're married?"

"Ah," said Morewood, "now what is it when you're married? Does any duly qualified person wish
to answer the question?" His mischievous glance rested again on May Quisanté.

"Oh, marriage is all right," said Dick, raising his voice to allow his wife to hear. "At least
it's not so bad as things go in this world. It's giving a shilling and getting back eleven-pence."

There was a little murmur of applause. "I declare every married person at the table seems to
endorse the opinion," said Marchmont with a laugh. "We'll keep our shillings, I think, Morewood."

"You'd better wait till somebody offers you change," advised Lady Richard.

"Meanwhile we've had an admirable expert opinion," said Marchmont.

"Which we believe," added Morewood, "as implicitly as we do in the excellence of the Alethea
Printing Press."

"Hallo, are you in it too?" cried Dick. "You see we're all disciples," he added to May. She
smiled slightly and turned to Jimmy Benyon who was by her, as though to speak to him; but Morewood's
voice cut across her remark.

"No, I'm not. I'm a sceptic there," he said.

"Oh, well, you don't know anything about it," Dick assured him placidly. If plain-speaking
were the order of the day, the Benyon family could hold their own.

"I bet he hasn't read the prospectus," said Jimmy.

"Couldn't understand it, if he had," added Dick, after a comforting gulp of champagne.

"You're really splendid people to be in with," said May, looking gratefully from one brother
to the other. They were so staunch, and alas, how had they been treated!

For a moment Morewood said nothing; he sat smiling maliciously.

"Shall I give my authority?" he asked. "It won't do you any harm if I do, because I can't call
him to give evidence."

"We had all the best authorities," said Dick Benyon, "as you'd know if you'd read the prospectus."

"Hang the prospectus! What's the good of reading a man's puff of his own wares? But I'm certain
you hadn't one authority."

"Well, who's your authority?" asked Jimmy, with a contempt that he took no trouble to conceal.

"What he said was confidential, you know----"

"Oh, you won't get out of it like that. We're all friends here. Fire away."

Thus exhorted, and indeed nothing loth--for he had not read the prospectus and knew not the
full extent of what he did--Morewood drew his malicious little bow and shot his arrow, sharper-pointed
than he fancied. "I suppose you'll admit," said he with the exaggerated carelessness of a man
with an unanswerable case, "that poor old Maturin was some authority, and he told me in confidence--I
asked him about it, you know, just to be able to warn you fellows--that there was an absolutely
fatal defect in your machine."

To score too great a triumph is sometimes as disconcerting as to fail. There was no chorus
of indignation, no denial of Maturin's authority, no good-natured scoffing such as Morewood
had expected. He looked round on faces fallen into a sudden troubled seriousness; no voice
was raised in protest, gay or grave. In an instant he knew that he had done something far beyond
what his humour had suggested; but what it was or how it came about, he could not tell.

The Benyon brothers were not over-ready of speech in a difficulty; their thoughts were busy
now, but their tongues tied. Marchmont found nothing to say; he could not help raising his
eyes under half-drooped lids till they rested on May Quisanté's face. There was a moment more
of silence; then, answering the tacit summons of the table, May Quisanté spoke. She leant forward
a little, smiling, and spoke clearly and composedly.

"Oh, you misunderstood him," she said. "He was consulted, but fell ill before he could go into
all the facts or write his report. But he had expressed a favourable opinion of the Alethea
to my husband." She paused, and then added, "If you'd taken the trouble to read the prospectus
you'd have known that, Mr. Morewood."

Little Lady Richard laughed nervously, glanced round, and rose from the table; it was sooner
than the ladies were wont to move but, as she said, nobody seemed to be eating any fruit, and
so there was nothing to stay for. The men sat down again. Morewood perceived very clearly that
a constraint had come upon them; but he was possessed by curiosity.

"Well, I should like to see the prospectus now," he said.

"You'll find one or two over there," said Dick, jerking his head towards a writing-table, but
not rising.

Morewood made in the direction indicated, a low mutter from Dick following him. Then Jimmy
observed:

"He doesn't understand a thing about it, you know, and of course he didn't follow what Maturin
said."

The others nodded. This explanation was indeed the simple one; in most cases it would have
been accepted without demur; or recourse would have been had to the hypothesis of a sudden
change in the Professor's opinion; indeed Marchmont broached this solution in an off-hand way.
Neither view was explicitly rejected, but a third possibility was in their minds, one which
would not and could not have been there, had any one of the three had the settling of the prospectus
and conducted the business with Maturin. But Alexander Quisanté, assisted only by cousin Mandeville,
had conducted the business and drawn the prospectus.

Morewood came back, sat down, and poured out a glass of wine.

"Yes, I see what it says," he observed. His mood of malice was gone, he looked troubled and
rather remorseful. "Well, I only repeated what Maturin said. I'd no idea there was anything
about him in the prospectus."

The two reasonable views were suggested again by Dick and Marchmont.

"It's impossible that I misunderstood him, but of course he may have changed his mind." He
paused, seeming to think. "I gather that he put nothing in writing?" he went on. "He only talked
to you about it?"

After a little pause Jimmy Benyon said, "Not exactly to us--to the people at the office, you
know. And there was nothing in writing as you say--at least so I understand too."

Morewood passed his hand through his hair; the ruffled locks intensified the ruefulness of
his aspect; he had before his eyes the picture of May Quisanté's silence and her so careful,
so deliberate little speech after it. He tossed off his wine almost angrily, as Dick Benyon
rose, saying, "Let's have coffee in the garden. It's a splendid night." He added with a rather
uneasy laugh, "Quisanté's coming to-morrow! We'll leave him to tackle you himself, Morewood."

Lady Richard and Fanny Gaston were sitting in the garden by the drawing-room window when the
men joined them; Morewood dropped into a chair by Lady Richard and, looking across the lawn,
saw May strolling by herself on the walk that bounded the shrubberies. He took his coffee in
silence and then lighted his pipe; the vanity of cigarettes was not for him. At last he said
confidentially,

"I've a sort of feeling that I've made an ass of myself."

Lady Richard glanced round; Fanny had gone across to the other group; nobody was in hearing.

"Do you know," she said in a low voice, "I believe that man's been up to some trick again.
You know how he treated us over the Crusade? Now I suppose he's going to ruin us!" The satisfaction
of a justified prophet seemed to mingle with the dismay of a wife and the anger of a sufferer;
Lady Richard had expected nothing less all along!

"I'm afraid I rather--well, that Lady May didn't like it."

"Poor dear May must know what to expect by now."

"Perhaps she never knows what to expect. That'd be worse." The remark was a little too subtle
for Lady Richard's half-attentive ear. She contented herself with sighing expressively. Morewood
looked across the lawn again; the slow-walking figure had disappeared, presumably into the
shrubberies. Two or three moments later he saw Marchmont strolling off in that direction, cigar
in mouth and hands in pockets. He rose, shook himself, and cried to the brothers, "Oh, in heaven's
name, come and play pool." Jimmy refused and paired off with his fiancée, but Dick agreed to
billiards, saying as they went in, "It'll keep you from making a fool of yourself any more."
Morewood, finding his own impression of his conduct thus confirmed, grunted remorsefully as
he took down his cue.

Marchmont crossed the lawn and the path, and was hidden by the shrubberies. Lady Richard watched
till she could see him no more, and then went indoors with another sigh; this last was a disclaimer
of responsibility; if Marchmont liked to comfort May, it was no business of hers.

He loitered on, not admitting that he was looking for May, but very sore to think that she
had wandered away to a sad solitude rather than be with her friends; since she did that, she
was wounded indeed. There was a seat round an old tree-trunk at the farther side of the shrubbery;
the memory of it really directed his apparently aimless steps, and as he approached it he threw
away his half-smoked cigar; he thought he would find her there; what he would say to her he
did not know.

He was right. There, she sat, very still, and looking pale under the moon. Coming up to her
he said, "I know you want to be alone, don't you?" She smiled and answered, "No, stay. I'm
glad to have you," and he sat down by her. She was silent, her eyes gazing steadily in front
of her; the air was sweet and very still. Now he needed no telling that his guess at the situation
had been right, that she had shielded her husband at her own cost; her face told him what the
cost seemed to her. A great indignation against the man filled him, gaining unacknowledged
reinforcement from the love he himself had for the woman. He had wrought for himself a masterpiece
of pure and faultless beauty; when another took it from him, he had endured; now the other
spoilt and stained and defiled it; could he still endure? It seems sometimes as though the
deep silence of night carries thoughts from heart to heart that would be lost in the passage
through the broken tumultuous sea of day. The thought that was in him he felt to be in her
also, changed as her mind would change it, yet in essence the same. She had now no ironical
smiles for him, no fencing, and no playing with her fate; and he had for her no talk of loyalty.
The time for these was gone in the light of the confidence that her silence gave him; it told
him everything, and he had no rebuke for its openness. At last he put out his hand and lightly
pressed hers for a moment. She turned her eyes on him.

"It's a little hard, isn't it?" she asked. "I can stand most things, but it's hard to have
to tell lies to your friends." Her voice rose a little and shook as the composure which she
had so long kept failed her. "And they know I'm lying. Oh, I don't deceive them, however hard
I try. They don't tell me so, but they know. I can't help it, I must do it. I must sit and
do it, knowing that they know it's a lie. For decency's sake I must do it, though. Some people
believe, the Mildmays believe; but you here don't. You know me too well, and you know him too
well."

"For God's sake, don't talk like that," said Marchmont.

"Don't talk like that! The talk's not the harm. If you could tell me how not to live like that!"
Her self-control broke utterly; she covered her face with her hands and sobbed.

"For God's sake!" he murmured again.

"Oh, you don't know. This is only the crown of it. It goes on every day. I'm coming not to
know myself, not to be myself. I live scheming and lying. I've given everything, all my life.
Must I give myself, my own self, too? Must I lose that for him?"

Her bitter despairing words seemed to him what at that moment her mood made them seem to herself,
the all-sufficient all-embracing summary of her life; she had then no thought of another side
to it, and into that she gave him no insight. He counted as dead for her all the high hopes
and the attractive imaginings with which Quisanté once had fired her. Dead for her they were
at that moment; she could see nothing but her husband's baseness and a baseness bred by it
in herself; her bond to him was an obligation to dishonour and a chain of treachery. She abandoned
to Marchmont's eyes all the hidden secrets of her misery; in this she seemed also to display
before him the dead body of her hopes, her interest, her ambitions. Giving all, she had gained
nothing; so her sobs said. But only for moments does life seem so simple that a sob can cover
all of it.

Presently she grew calmer. "I've never broken out like this before," she said, "but it's rather
bad to have to look forward to a life of it. And it'll get worse, not better; or if it doesn't
get worse it'll mean that I'm getting worse, and that'll be worse than all." She smiled forlornly.
"What a tangle of 'worses' I've tied it up in, haven't I?"

She did not seem to be ashamed of her breaking-out, but rather to be relieved by it, and to
feel that it had helped to establish or renew an intimacy in which she found some pleasure
and some consolation; at least there was one friend now who knew exactly how she stood and
would not set down to that own self of hers the actions that he might see her perform in Quisanté's
service. "You once told me I ought to take a confidante," she reminded him. "I don't suppose
you thought I should take you, though."

She had had her outburst; his was still to come. Yet it seemed rather as though he acted on
a deliberate purpose than was carried away by any irresistible impulse; he spoke simply and
plainly.

"I love you as I've always loved you," he said.

"I know, and I've taken advantage of it to inflict all this on you." Her eyes rested on his
for some moments, and she answered his glance. "No, I can't escape that way. I'm not talking
of running away; of course I couldn't do that." She laughed a little and even he smiled. "But
I can't escape even in--in spirit by it. Sometimes I wish I could. It would change the centre
of my life, wouldn't it? Perhaps I shouldn't mind the things that distress me so much now.
But I can't."

"You don't love me? Well, you never did." He paused an instant and added in a puzzled way,
"Somehow."

"Yes, it's all 'somehow.' Somehow I didn't; I ought to have. Somehow I've got where I am; and
somehow, I suppose, I shall endure it." She laid her hand on his. "I should actually like to
love you--in a way I do. I'm afraid I've very little conscience about it. But somehow--yes,
somehow again--it's all a hopeless puzzle--I can't altogether, not as you mean. I understand
it very little myself, and I know you won't understand it at all, but--well, Alexander imprisons
me; I can't escape from him; as long as he's there he keeps me." She looked in Marchmont's
face and then shook her head, half-sadly, half-playfully. "You don't understand a bit, do you?"
she asked.

"No, I don't," he said bluntly, with an accent of impatience and almost of exasperation. Recognising
it, she gave the slightest shrug of her shoulders.

"It's my infatuation again, I suppose, as you all said when I married him. It makes you all
angry. Oh, it makes me angry too, as far as that goes."

"He's ruining your whole life."

She made no answer, relapsing into the still silence which had preceded her tears. Marchmont
was baffled again by his old inability to follow the movements of her mind and the old sense
of blindness in dealing with her to which it gave rise. Owing to this he had lost her at the
first; now it seemed to prevent him from repairing the loss. In spite of all that they had
in common, in spite of the strong attraction she felt towards him and of the love he bore her,
there was always, as she had said once, at last a break somewhere, some solution in the chain
of sympathy that should have bound them together. But he would not admit this, and chose to
see the only barrier between them in the man who was ruining her life.

"You'd be yourself again if only you could get away from him," he murmured resentfully.

"Perhaps; I never shall, though." She added, laughing a little, "Neither will you. I've made
you an accomplice, you're bound to a guilty silence now." Then, growing grave, she leant towards
him. "Don't look like that," she said, "pray, pray, pray don't. I haven't spoilt your life
as well as my own? No, you mustn't tell me that." Her voice grew very tender and low. "But
I can say almost all you want. I wish I had loved you, I wish I had married you. Oh, how I
wish it! I should have been happy, I think, and I know I--I shouldn't have had to live as I
do now and do the things I have to do now. Well, it's too late."

"You're very young," he said in a voice as low as hers. "It mayn't always be too late."

She started a little, drawing away from him. He had brought back thoughts which the stress
of pain and excitement had banished from her mind.

"You mean----?" she murmured. "I know what you mean, though." Her face showed again a sort
of puzzle. "I can't think of that happening. I tried the other day--à propos of something else;
but I couldn't. I couldn't see it, you know. It doesn't fit my ideas about him. No, that won't
happen. We must just go on."

The wind had begun to rise, the trees stirred, leaves rustled, the whole making, or seeming
to her ears to make, a sad whimsical moaning. She rose, gathering her lace scarf closer round
her neck, and saying, "Do you hear the wood crying for us? It's sorry for our little troubles."
She stood facing him and he took both her hands in his. "You look so unhappy," she said in
a fresh access of pity. "No use, no use; it'll all go on, right to the end of everything. So--good-bye."

"He's coming to-morrow, isn't he?"

"Yes, he's coming to-morrow. Good-bye." She smiled a little, feeling Marchmont's hands drawing
her to him. "Oh, kiss me then," she said, turning her cheek to him. "It'll feel friendly. And
now we'll go in."

They had just started to return when they heard steps in the wood, and a moment later her name
was called in Dick Benyon's voice. Marchmont shouted in answer, "Here we are," and Dick came
along the path.

"I couldn't think where you'd got to," he said.

"That's because you've no romance in you," said May. "Or you'd have known we should be wandering
in the wood in the moonlight. Ah, she's gone under a cloud now, but she was beautiful. Are
we wanted, though?"

"Well, in the first place I think you've been quite long enough for propriety, and in the second
a man's brought a wire for you, and he's waiting to see if there's an answer."

"Under that combination of moral and practical reasons we'll go in," said May, laughing. Marchmont,
less ready in putting on his mask, said nothing but followed a step or two behind. "I expect
the wire's from Alexander," she went on, "to say he's going to make a speech somewhere and
won't come to-morrow."

Dick turned to her with a quick jerk of the head; a moment later he was covered with confusion,
for her bitter little smile told him that he had betrayed the joy which such a notion gave
him. To all of them it would be a great relief that Quisanté should not come while the memory
of the scene that Morewood had caused at dinner was still so fresh. Dick, though he attempted
no excuse, felt himself forgiven when May took his arm and thus walked back to the house.

    "Your husband had a slight seizure while dining with us to-night.
    He is comfortable now, and there is no immediate reason for anxiety.
    But doctor thinks you had better come up earliest convenient train
    to-morrow. Winterton Mildmay."

May read the telegram, standing between Marchmont and Dick. She handed it to Dick, saying,
"Read it, and will you send an answer that I'll come as early as possible in the morning;"
then she walked to the table and sat down by it. Dick gave Marchmont the slip of paper and
went off to despatch the answer. Nobody else was in the room, except Fanny Gaston, who was
playing softly on the piano in the corner. Marchmont came up to May and put the telegram down
on the table by her.

"I'm so sorry," he said formally and constrainedly.

"I don't suppose it's very serious," she said. "But I must go, of course." She went on under
the cover of Fanny's gentle music. "It's all rather odd though--its coming to-night and its
happening at the Mildmays'. I forgot, though, you don't know why I feel that so odd. How Lady
Mildmay'll nurse him! I expect I shall have a struggle to get him out of the house and home again."

Marchmont made no answer but stood looking down on her face. She met his glance fairly, and
knew what it was that had forced itself into his mind and now found expression in his eyes.
She had declared to him that her fate was irrevocable, that the lines of her life were set,
that nothing but death could alter them, and that death had no part in her thoughts about her
husband. The telegram did not prove her wrong; yet seizure was a vague word under which much
might lie hidden. But her mood and her feeling still remained; it was not in hope or in any
attempt at self-consolation, but in the expression of an obstinate conviction which dominated
her mind that she said in answer to Marchmont's glance, "I can't believe it's anything really
amiss. I expect I shall find him at work again when I get back to-morrow."

With a little movement of his hands Marchmont turned away. He had at command no conventional
phrases in which to express a desire that she might prove right. It was impossible to say that
he wished she might prove wrong; even in his own mind a man leaves a hope like that vague and
unformulated. But he marvelled, still without understanding, at the strange obstinate idea
which seemed almost to exalt Quisanté above the ordinary lot of mortals, to see in him a force
so living that it could not perish, a vitality so intense that death could lay no hand on it.
He glanced at her as he crossed the room to the piano; she sat now with the telegram in her
hands and her eyes fixed on the floor in front of her. It needed a sharper summons, a nearer
reality, to rouse her from the conviction that her life was bound for ever to that of the man
whom she had chosen and for whom she had given so much. It would all go on, right to the end
of everything. The telegram had not shaken that faith in her, nor altered that despair.

                           CHAPTER XVII.

                             DONE FOR?

A knotty point of casuistry was engaging the thoughts of the Dean of St. Neot's. Morewood had
been to see him, had told without disguise the whole story of his blunder at the dinner-table
at Ashwood, had referred to Alexander Quisanté's serious illness, and had finally, without
apology and without periphrasis, expressed the hope that Alexander Quisanté would die. The
Dean's rebuke had produced a strenuous effort at justification. Quisanté was, the painter pointed
out, no doubt a force, but a force essentially immoral (Morewood took up morality when it suited
his purpose); he did work, but he made unhappiness; he affected people's lives, but not so
as to promote their well-being. Or if the Dean chose to champion the man, Morewood was ready
for him again. If Quisanté were good, were moral, were deserving of defence, then the merely
natural process lugubriously described as death, and fantastically treated with black plumes
and crape, would, so far as he himself was concerned, be no more than a transition to a better
state of existence, while certain solid and indisputable benefits would accrue to those who
were condemned to wait a little longer for their summons. Whether the Dean elected to be for
Quisanté or against him, Morewood claimed a verdict.

This challenging of a man's general notions by the putting of a thorny special case was rather
resented by the Dean; it reminded him of the voluble atheist in Hyde Park, who bases his attack
on the supernatural on the obsolete enactments of the Book of Leviticus. None the less he was
rather puzzled as to what he had a right to wish about Alexander Quisanté, and so he had recourse
to his usual remedy--a consultation with his wife. He had the greatest faith in Mrs. Baxter's
eye for morality; perhaps generations of clerical ancestry had bred in her such an instinct
as we see in sporting-dogs; she could not go wrong. On this question she was immediately satisfactory.

"We are forbidden," she said, removing a piece of tape from her mouth, "to wish anybody's death;
you know that as well as I do, Dan." She made a stitch or two. "We must leave it to Providence,"
she ended serenely.

At first sight there was nothing much in this dictum; it appeared even commonplace. But Mrs.
Baxter had been lunching with the Mildmays, had heard a full account of what the doctors said
about Quisanté, and had expressed her conviction that he could not possibly last long. So far
as could be judged then, the confidence which she proposed to show ran no appreciable risk
of being misplaced, while at the same time she avoided committing herself by any expression
of a personal opinion.

"Doubtless, my dear," said the Dean with a little cough.

"If he had thought less about himself and more about other people----" she resumed.

"That can't have anything to do with an apoplectic seizure," the Dean pleaded.

Mrs. Baxter looked up with a patient smile.

"If you weren't in such a hurry, Dan, to show what you call your enlightenment (though heaven
knows you may be wrong all the time, and a judgment is a perfectly possible thing) you'd have
found out that I was only going to say that, if he'd thought more of other people, he'd find
other people thinking more about him now."

"There I quite agree with you, my dear."

Mrs. Baxter looked less grateful than she might have for this endorsement of her views; self-confidence
is apt to hold external support in cheap esteem.

"When the first Mrs. Greening died," she remarked, "they gave the maids very nice black frocks,
with a narrow edging of good crape. The very first Sunday-out that Elizabeth had--the butcher's
daughter near the Red Cow--you remember?--she stuck a red ribbon round the neck."

The Dean looked puzzled.

"Mrs. Greening was the most selfish woman I've ever known," explained Mrs. Baxter; and she
added with a pensive smile, "And I've lived in a Cathedral town for thirty years."

The red-ribbon became intelligible; it fell into line with Morewood's ill-disciplined wish.
Both signified an absence of love, such a departing without being desired as serves for the
epitaph of a Jewish king. The Dean cast round for somebody who would prove such an inscription
false on Alexander Quisanté's tomb.

"Anyhow it would break the old aunt's heart," he said.

"It'd save her money," observed Mrs. Baxter.

"And his wife!" mused the Dean. It was impossible to say whether there were a question in his
words or not. But his first instance had not been Quisanté's wife; the old aunt offered a surer
case.

"If you always knew what a man's wife thought about him, you'd know a great deal," said Mrs.
Baxter. She possessed in the fullest degree her sex's sense of an ultimate superiority in perception;
men knew neither what their wives did nor what they were; wives might not know what their husbands
did, but they always knew what they were. It would be rash to differ from a person of her observation
and experience; half a dozen examples would at once have confounded the objector.

Mrs. Baxter took perhaps a too private and domestic view of the man whose fate she was discussing;
she judged the husband and friend, she had nothing to say to the public character. The voices
of his political associates and acquaintances, of his fellow-workers in business, of his followers
and enthusiastic adherents in his constituency, did not reach her ears, and perhaps, if they
had, would not have won much attention. The consternation of Constantine Blair, Lady Castlefort's
dismay, the sad gossiping and head-shaking that went on in the streets of Henstead and round
old Mr. Foster's comfortable board, witnessed to a side of Quisanté in which Mrs. Baxter did
not take much interest. She did not understand the sort of stupor with which they who had lived
with him and worked with him saw the force he wielded and the anticipations he filled them
with both struck down by a sudden blow; she did not share the feeling that all at once a gap
had been made in life.

But something of this sort was the effect in all the circles which Quisanté had invaded and
in which he had moved. The philosophical might already be saying that there was no necessary
man; to the generality that reflection would come only later, when they had found a new leader,
a fresh inspiration, and another personality in which to see the embodiment of their hopes.
Now the loss was too fresh and too complete; for although it might be doubtful how long Quisanté's
life would last, there seemed no chance of his ever filling the place to which he had appeared
to be destined. Only a miracle could give that back to one who must cling to life, if he could
keep his hold on it at all, at the cost of abandoning all the efforts and all the activities
which had made it what it was alike for himself and for others. He was rallying slowly and
painfully from his blow; a repetition of it would be the certain penalty of any strenuous mental
exertion or any sustained strain of labour. In inactivity, in retirement, in the placid existence
of a recognised invalid he might live years, indeed probably would; but otherwise the authorities
declined to promise him any life at all. His body had played him false in the end. Constantine
Blair began to look out for a candidate for Henstead and to wonder whether Sir Winterton would
again expose himself to the unpleasantness of a contested election; Lady Castlefort must find
another Prime Minister, the fighting men another champion, even the Alethea Printing Press
Limited a new chairman. The places he had filled or made himself heir to were open to other
occupants and fresh pretenders. That the change seemed so considerable proved how great a figure
he had become in men's eyes no less than how utterly his career was overthrown. The comments
on his public life were very flattering, but already they praised in the tone of an obituary
notice, and the hopes they expressed of his being able some day to return to the arena were
well understood to be no more than a kind or polite refusal to display naked truth in the merciless
clearness of print.

Here was the state of things which extorted from Morewood the blunt wish that Quisanté might
die. Such a desire was hardly cruel to the man himself, since he must now lose all that he
had loved best in the market of the world; but it was not the man himself who had been most
in Morewood's thoughts. With a penetration sharpened by the memory of his blunder he had appreciated
the perverse calamity which had fallen on the man's wife, and had passed swiftly to the conclusion
that for her an end by death was the only chance, the only turn of events which could give
back to her the chance of a real life to be lived. He knew by what Quisanté had attracted and
held her; all that, it seemed, was gone now. He divined also in what Quisanté repelled and
almost terrified her; that would remain so long as breath was in the man and might grow even
more intense. A sense of fairness somehow impelled him to his wish; her bargain had turned
out so badly; the underlying basis of her marriage was broken; she was left to pay the price
to the last penny, but was to get nothing of what she had looked to purchase. Was it not then
the part of a courageous man to face his instinctive wish, and to accept it boldly? Cant and
tradition apart, it must be the wish of every sensible person. For she knew, she had realised
most completely on the very evening when Quisanté was struck down, what manner of man he was.
She might have endured if she had still been able to tell herself of the wonderful things that
he would do. No such comfort was open now. The man was still what he was; but he would do nothing.
There came the change.

"That's the weak point about marriage as compared with other contractual arrangements," said
Morewood to Dick Benyon. "You can never in any bargain ensure people getting what they expect
to get--because to do that you'd have to give all of them sense--but in most you can to a certain
extent see that they're allowed to keep what they actually did get. In marriage you can't.
Something of this sort happens and the whole understanding on which the arrangement was based
breaks down."

"Do people marry on understandings?" asked Dick doubtfully.

"The only way of getting anything like justice for her is that he should die. You must see that?"

"I don't know anything about it," said Dick morosely, "but I hear there's no particular likelihood
of his dying if he obeys orders and keeps quiet."

"Just so, just so," said Morewood. "That's exactly what I mean. Do you suppose she'd ever have
taken him if he'd been going to keep quiet? You know why you took him up; well, she did just
the same. You know what you found him; she's found him just the same. What's left now? The
rôle of a loving nurse! She's not born a nurse; and how in the devil's name is she to be expected
to love him?"

Dick Benyon found no answer to questions which put with a brutal truthfulness the salient facts
of the position. The one thing necessary, the one thing which would have made the calamity
bearable, perhaps better than bearable, was wanting. She might love or have loved things in
him, or about him, or done by him; himself she did not love; and now nothing but himself remained
to her. Seeing the matter in this light, Dick was dumb before Morewood's challenge to him to
say, if he dared, that he hoped a long life for Alexander Quisanté. "ah no obtrusively, but want

The world at large, conceiving that the last word had been said and the last scene in which
it was interested played, had soon turned its curious eyes away from Quisanté's sick bed, leaving
only the gaze of the smaller circle personally concerned in the dull and long-drawn-out ending
of a piece once so full of dramatic incident. But the world found itself wrong, and all the
eyes spun round in amazed staring when the sick man leapt from his bed and declared that he
was himself again. The news came in paragraphs, to the effect that after another week's rest
Mr. Quisanté, whose health had made a rapid and great improvement, hoped to return to his Parliamentary
duties and to fulfil the more urgent of his public engagements. Here was matter enough for
surprise, but it was needful to add the fast-following well-authenticated stories of how the
doctors had protested, how Sir Rufus Beaming had washed his hands of the case, and how Dr.
Claud Manton had addressed an energetic warning to Lady May Quisanté. This last item came home
most closely to the general feeling, and the general voice asked what Lady May was thinking
of. There was warrant for the question in the wondering despair of Lady Mildmay and the sad
embarrassment of debonair Sir Winterton. The Mildmays knew all about it, the whole thing had
happened in their house; but Sir Winterton, challenged with the story about Sir Rufus, could
only hum and ha, and Lady Mildmay had not denied the interview between Quisanté's wife and
the energetic Dr. Manton. What was the meaning of it? And, once again, what was Lady May Quisanté
thinking of? Was she blind, was she careless? Or were the doctors idiots? The world, conscious
of its own physical frailty, shrank from the last question and confined its serious attention
to the two preceding ones. "Does she want to kill him?" asked the honest graspers of the obvious.
"Does she think him above all laws?" was the question of those who wished to be more subtle.
At least she was a puzzle. All agreed on that.

Lady Richard discountenanced all speculation and all questionings. For her part she did her
duty, mentioning to Mrs. Baxter that this was what she meant to do and that, whatever happened,
she intended to be able, salvâ conscientiâ, to tell herself that she had done it; Mrs. Baxter
approved, saying that this was what the second Mrs. Greening had done when her husband's sister's
daughter, a very emancipated young woman as it seemed, had incomprehensibly flirted with the
auctioneer's apprentice and had scouted Mrs. Greening's control; Mrs. Greening had told the
girl's mother and sent the girl home, second class, under the care of the guard. Similarly
then Lady Richard, without embarking on any consideration of ultimate problems, wrote to May,
suggesting that Mr. Quisanté wanted rest and putting Ashwood at her disposal for so long as
she and her husband might be pleased to occupy it. "If they don't choose to go, it's not my
fault," said Lady Richard with the sigh which declares that every reasonable requirement of
conscience has been fulfilled. Happy lady, to be able to repose in this conviction by the simple
expedient of lending a house not otherwise required at the moment! So kind are we to our own
actions that Lady Richard felt meritorious.

They chose to go, and went unaccompanied save by their baby girl and Aunt Maria--this last
a strange addition made at Quisanté's own request. He had not been wont to show such a desire
for the old lady's society when there was nothing to be gained by seeking it; nor had it seemed
to May altogether certain that Miss Quisanté would come. Yet she came with ardent eagerness
and her nephew was plainly glad to have her. It took May a little while to understand why,
but soon she saw the reason. Aunt Maria was deep in the conspiracy, or the infatuation, or
whatever it was to be called; she flattered Quisanté's hope of life, she applauded his defiance
of the inevitable; she hung on him more and more, herself forgetting and making him forget
the peril of the way he trod. He wanted to be told that he was right, and he wanted an applauding
audience. In both ways Aunt Maria satisfied him. She would talk of the present as though it
were no more than a passing interruption of a long career, of the future as though it stretched
in assured leisure through years of great achievement, of his life and his life's work as though
both were in his own hand and subject to nothing save his own will and power. She was to him
the readiest echo of the world's wonder and applause, the readiest assurance that his great
effort was not going unrecognised. Hence he would have her with him, though there seemed no
more love and no more tenderness between them than when in old days they had quarrelled and
he had grumbled and she had flung him her money with a bitter jeer. But she lived in him and
could think of him only as living, and through her he could cheat himself into an assurance
that indeed he could live and work.

Then Aunt Maria was very bad for him. That could not be denied, but something more nearly touching
herself pressed on May Quisanté. She had seen the Mildmays' painful puzzle; she had listened
to Dr. Claud Manton's energetic warning; it was before her, no less than before the patient,
that Sir Rufus had washed his hands. She was not ignorant of the questions the world asked.
She was not careless, nor was she any longer the dupe of her old delusion that such a man as
Quisanté could not die. Her eye for truth had conquered; now she believed that, if he persisted
in his rebellion, he must surely die; unless all medical knowledge went for nothing, he would
surely die, and die not after long years of lingering, but soon, perhaps very soon. A moment
of excitement, say one of the moments that she had loved so much, might kill him; so Claud
Manton said. A life of excitement would surely and early do the work. And why was he rebellious?
She accused himself, she accused Aunt Maria, she accused the foolishly wondering, foolishly
chattering world; and in every accusation there was some justice. Was there enough to acquit
the other defendant who stood arraigned? To that she dared not answer "Yes," because of the
fear which was in her that the strongest amongst all the various impulses driving him to his
defiance was in the end to be found in his relations to her, in the attitude of his own wife
towards him. Ashwood was full of associations; there was Duty Hill, where he had risen to his
greatest and thereby won her; there was the tree beneath which she had sat with Marchmont on
the evening when the knowledge of her husband's worst side had been driven like a sharp knife
into her very heart. But more vivid than these memories now was the recollection of that first
evening when she had seen him sitting alone, nobody's friend, and had determined to be human
towards him and to treat him in a human way. There had been the true beginning of her great
experiment. Now she told herself that she had failed in it, had never been human to him, and
had never treated him in a human way, had not been what a man's wife should be, had stood always
outside, a follower, an admirer, a critic, an accuser, never simply the woman who was his wife.
His fault or hers, or that of both--it seemed to matter little. The experiment had been hers;
and because she had made it and failed, it seemed to her that he was braving death. Had she
been different, perhaps he would not have rebelled and could have lived the quiet life with
her. It needed little more to make her tell herself that she drove him to his death, that she
was with the enemy, with the chattering world and with poor deluded old Aunt Maria; she was
of the conspirators; she egged him on to brave his doom.

In darker vein still ran her musings sometimes, when there came over her that haunting self-distrust;
the fear that she was juggling with herself, shutting her eyes to the sin of her own heart,
and, in spite of all her protestations, was really inspired by a secret hope too black and
treacherous to put in words. However passionately she repudiated it, it still cried mockingly,
"I am here!" It asked if her prayers for her husband's life were sincere, if her care for him
were more than a due paid to decency, if the doom were in truth a thing she dreaded, and not
a deliverance which convention alone forbade her openly to desire. Plainly, plainly--did she
wish the doom to fall, did she wish him dead, was the rebellion that threatened death the course
which the secret craving of her heart urged him to take? To do everything for him was not enough,
if the doubt still lurked that her heart was not in the doing. For now she could no more ask
coolly what she wished; the thing had come too near; it was odious to have a thought except
of saving him by all means and at every cost; it was intolerable not to know at least that
no part of the impulse which drove him to his rebellion lay at her door, not to feel at least
that she had nothing but dread and horror for the threatened doom. She had no love for him;
it came home to her now with a strange new sense of self-condemnation; she had married him
for her own pleasure, because he interested her and made life seem dull without him. She pleaded
no more that he had killed her love; it had never been there to kill. Had she left him to find
a woman who loved him in and for himself, not for his doings, not for the interest of him,
that woman might now be winning him by love from the open jaws of death.

Yet again laughter, obstinate and irrepressible, shot often in a jarring streak of inharmonious
colour across the sombre fabric of her thoughts. He was not only mad, not only splendid--he
seemed both to her--he was absurd too at moments, often when he was with Aunt Maria. Letters
came in great numbers, from political followers, from women prominent in society, from constituents,
from old Foster and Japhet Williams at Henstead, even from puissant Lady Castlefort; they wondered,
applauded, implored, flattered, in every key of that sweet instrument called praise. Quisanté
read them out, pluming and preening his feathers, strutting about, crowing. He would repeat
the passages he liked, asking his wife's approbation; that he must have, it seemed. She gave
it with what heartiness she could, and laughed only in her sleeve. Surely a man facing death
could have forgotten all this? Not Alexander Quisanté. He could die, and die bravely; but the
world must stand by his bedside. So till the end, whenever that most uncertainly dated end
might come, the old mixture promised to go on, the great and small, the mean and grand, the
call for tears and throbs of the heart alternating with the obstinate curling or curving of
lips swift to respond to the vision of the contemptible or the ludicrous.

But she had her appeal to make, the one thing, it seemed, she could do to put herself at all
in the right, the offer she must make, and try to make with a sincerity which should rise unimpaired
from the conflicts of her heart. She had caught at coming to Ashwood because she thought she
could make it best there, not indeed in the room where she had lied for him, nor by the tree
where she had turned to Marchmont in a pang of wild regret, but there, on Duty Hill, where
he had won her, had touched his highest, and had seemed a conqueror. She took him there, climbing
with him very slowly, very gently; there she made him sit and sat by him. Again it was a quiet
evening, and still the valley stretched below; nothing changed here made all the changes of
her life seem half unreal. Here she told him he must live, he must be docile and must live.

"You may get strong again, but for the time you must do as the doctors say. You ought to; for
the little girl's sake, if for nothing else, you ought to. You know you're risking another
seizure now, and you know what that might mean."

His eyes were fixed keenly on her, though he lay back motionless in weariness.

"You ought to live for your daughter." She paused a minute and added, "And some day we might
have a son, and you'd live again in him; we both should; we should feel that we were doing--that
you were doing--everything he did. I think your son would be a great man, and I should be proud
to be his mother. Isn't the hope of that worth something?"

He was silent, watching her closely still.

"I know what you think of me," she continued. "You think an active life essential to me, that
I can't do without it. God knows I loved all you did, I loved your triumphs, I loved to hear
you speak and see them listen. You know I loved all that, loved it too much perhaps. But I'll
do without it. I'm your wife, your fate's mine. It'll be the braver thing for you to face it,
really; I'm ready to face it with you."

Still he would only look at her.

"We know what we both are," she went on with a little smile. "We're not Mildmays, you and I.
But let's try. I must tell you. I can't bear to think that it's partly at least because of
me that you won't try, that if I were a different sort of woman it might be much easier for
you to try. If it's that at all, imagine what I should feel if--if anything happened such as
the doctors are afraid of."

"I've chosen my course. I believe the doctors are all wrong."

"Do you really believe that?" she asked quickly.

He shrugged his shoulders, seeming to say that he would not discuss it. "A great many considerations
influence me," he said with a touch of pompousness.

"Am I one of them?" she persisted. "Because I don't want to be. I'm ready to share your life,
whatever it is."

"Are you?" he asked, with something of the same malicious smile that he was wont to bestow
on Aunt Maria. "Do you think you could share my life? Do you think you have?"

"I know what you mean," she said, flushing a little. "I daresay I've been hard and--and didn't
take the pains to understand, and was uncharitable perhaps. Anyhow there'll be no opportunity
for any more--any more misunderstandings of that sort."

"No; the understanding's clear enough now," said he.

She looked at him almost despairingly; he seemed so strangely hostile, so bitterly sensitive
to her judgment of him.

"You think me," he went on, with his persistent eyes unwaveringly set on her, "a not over-honest
mountebank; that's what you and your friends think me."

"Oh, I wish I'd never tried to talk to you about it!" she cried. "You take hold of some hasty
mood or look of mine and treat it as if it were everything. You know it isn't."

"It's there, though."

"It never need be, never, never."

"You'll forget it all when we're settled down at--where was it?--Torquay or somewhere--in our
villa, like two old tabby-cats sitting in the sun? No time to think it all over then? No, only
all the hours of every day!" He paused and then added in a low hard voice, "I'm damned if I'll
do it. I may have to die, but I'll die standing." His eyes gleamed now, and for the first time
they turned from her and roamed over the prospect that lay below Duty Hill. But they were back
on her face soon.

"No, no," she implored. "Not because of me, for heaven's sake, not because of me!"

"Because of it all. Yes, and because of you too. You don't love me, you never have." He leant
towards her. "But I love you," he said, "yes, as I loved you when I asked you to be my wife
on this hill where we are. Then don't you understand? I won't go and live that old cat's life
with you." He laid his hand on hers. "Your eyes shall still sparkle for me, your breath shall
still come quick for me, your heart beat for me; or I'll have no more of it at all."

The touch of rhetoric, so characteristic of him, so unlike anything that Marchmont or Dick
Benyon would have used in such a case, did not displease her then. And it hit the truth as
his penetration was wont to hit it. That was what he wanted, that was what she could and should
and must give, or he would have nothing from her. Here was the truth; but the truth was what
she had struggled so hard to deny and feared so terribly to find true. He was not indeed led
by a sense of obligation towards her; the need was for himself. It was not that he felt in
her a right to call on him for exertions or for a performance of his side of the bargain; it
was that he could not bear to lose his tribute from her. But still she stood self-condemned.
Again the thought came--with a woman who loved him there might have been another tribute that
she could have paid and he been content to levy. He would have believed such a woman if she
told him that he would be as much to her, and she as much absorbed in him, in the villa at
Torquay as ever in the great world; and perhaps--oh, only perhaps, it is true--he would have
made shift with that and fed his appetite on the homage of one, since his wretched body denied
him the rows on rows of applauding spectators that he loved. But from his wife's lips he would
not accept any such assurance, and from her no such homage could be hoped for to solace him.

Then the strange creature began to talk to her, not of what he had done, nor even of what he
had hoped to do, but of what he meant and was going to do; how he would grow greater and richer,
of schemes in politics and in business, of the fervour and devotion of the fighting men behind
him and how they were sick of the old gang and would have no leader but Alexander Quisanté;
of the prosperity of the Alethea, how the shares rose, how big orders came in, how utterly
poor old Maturin had blundered. He spoke like a strong man with a wealth of years and store-houses
of force, who sees life stretched long before him, material to be shaped by his hand and forced
into what he will make it. He talked low and fast, his eyes again roaming over the prospect;
the evening fell while he still talked. Almost it seemed then that the doctors were wrong,
that his courage was no folly, that indeed he would not die. O for the faith to believe that!
For his spell was on her again now, and now she would not have him die. Once again he had his
desire; once more her heart beat and her eyes gleamed for him. But then it came on her, with
a sudden fierce light of conviction, that all this was hollow, useless, vain, that the sentence
was written and the doom pronounced. No pleading however eloquent could alter it. Quisanté
was stopped in mid-career by a short sharp sob that escaped from his wife's lips. He turned
and looked at her, breaking off the sentence that he had begun. She met his glance with a frightened
look in her eyes.

"What's the matter?" he asked slowly, rather resentfully.

"Nothing, nothing," she stammered. "I--I was excited by what you were saying." She tried to
laugh. "I'm emotional, you know, and you can always rouse my emotions."

"Was it that?" For a moment longer he sat upright, looking hard at her; then his body relaxed,
and he lay back, his lower lip dropping and his eyes half closed. An expression of great weariness
and despair came over him. He had read the meaning of her sob; and now he hid his face in his
hands. His pretences failed him, and he was assailed by the bitterness of truth and of death.

She rose, saying, "It's late, we must go in; you'll be over-tired."

After an instant Quisanté rose slowly and falteringly; he laid his arm in hers, and they stood
side by side, gazing down into the valley. This hill had come to mean much in their lives,
and somehow now they seemed to be saying good-bye to it.

"I could never forget this hill," she said, "any more than I could forget you. You told me
just now that I didn't love you. Well, as you mean it, perhaps not. But you've been almost
everything in the world to me. Everything in the world isn't all good, but it's--everything."
She turned to him suddenly and kissed him on the cheek. "Lean on me as we go down the hill,"
she said. There was pity and tenderness in the words and the tone. But Quisanté drew his arm
sharply away and braced his body to uprightness.

"I'm not tired. I can go quite well by myself. You look more tired than I do," he said. "Come,
we shall be late," and he set off down the hill at a brisk pace.

Her appeal then had failed; this last little incident told her that with unpitying plainness.
If he had yielded for a moment before the face of reality, he soon recovered himself, turned
away from the sight, and went back to his masquerading. She lacked the power to lead him from
it, and again she feared that she lacked the power because her will was not sincere and single.
Now they must go on to that uncertain end, he playing his part before the world, before her
and Aunt Maria, she looking on, sometimes in admiration, sometimes in contempt, always in fear
of the moment when the actor's speeches would be suddenly cut short and the curtain, falling
on the interrupted scene, hide him for ever from the audience whom he had made wondering applauding
partners in his counterfeit. The last of his life was to be like the rest of it, with the same
elements of tragedy and of farce, of what attracted and of what revolted, of the great and
the little. It was to be like in another way too; it was to be lived alone, without any true
companion for his soul, without the love that he had not asked except of one, and, asking of
that one, had not obtained. As the days went on, the fascination of the spectacle she watched
grew on her; it was more poignant now than in the former time, and it filled all her life.
Thus in some sort Alexander Quisanté had his way; his hold on her was not relaxed, his dominion
over her not abrogated, to the end of his life he would be what she told him he had been--almost
everything. When the end came, what would he be? The question crossed her thoughts, but found
no answer; some day it would fall to be answered. Now she could only watch and wait, half persuaded
that the pretence was no pretence, yet always dreading the summons of reality to end the play.
So the world asked in vain what May Quisanté was thinking of, whether she wanted to kill him,
or whether she thought him above all laws. A puzzle to the world and a puzzle to her friends,
she waited for the falling of the blow which Quisanté daily challenged.

Sir Rufus Beaming met Dr. Claud Manton at the Athenaeum and showed him a newspaper paragraph.

"To address a great meeting at Henstead!" said Manton, raising his brows and shaping his lips
for a whistle. "'From his own and neighbouring constituencies.'"

"He might just as well take chloroform comfortably by his fireside," said Sir Rufus. "It would
be a little quicker, perhaps, but not a bit more sure."

And again they washed their hands of the whole affair very solemnly.

                             CHAPTER XIX.

                            DEATH DEFIED.

Constantine Blair, no less active and soon little less serene in opposition than in power,
felt himself more than justified in all that he had ever said about Weston Marchmont when he
received an intimation of Marchmont's intention to apply for the Chiltern Hundreds. Yet he
was aghast at this voluntary retirement into the wilderness of private life, a life without
bustle, without gossip, without that sense of being intimate with the march of affairs and
behind the scenes of the national theatre. There were reasons assigned, of course. One was
that Marchmont found himself ("I'll bet he does!" groaned Constantine with anticipatory resignation)
more in agreement with the other side than with his own on an important question of foreign
politics then to the front. But this state of matters had ceased to be unusual with him and
hardly in itself accounted for the step he was now taking. The care of his estate was the second
reason, properly dismissed as plainly frivolous. In the end of the letter more sincerity peeped
out, as the writer lapsed from formality into friendship. "I know I shall surprise many people
and grieve some, but I'm sick of the thing. I can't endure the perpetual haggling between what
I ought to do and what I'm expected to do; the compromises that result satisfy me as little
as anybody. In fine, my dear Constantine, I'm going back to my pictures, my books, my hills,
and my friends." Constantine read with a genuine sorrow and criticised with a contemptuous
sniff. Pictures, books--and hills! Hills! It was insulting his intelligence. And though friends
were all very well, yet where was the use of them if a man deprived himself of all the sources
of entertaining conversation? But there was nothing to be done--except to tell Lady Castlefort
a day before the rest of the world knew. Constantine held her favour on that tenure. She showed
no surprise.

"A loss to the country, but not to us," she said.

"Just what I think," agreed Constantine, with a revival of cheerfulness.

"If I hadn't known him since he was so high, I'd wish he had the what-do-you-call-it seizures
instead of the other man."

"But Quisanté's not going, he means to hold on," said Constantine. "I'm glad of it. Henstead's
very shaky. But we shall hold Marchmont's seat all right. We're going to put up Dick Benyon."

"He's safe enough, he won't worry you," said Lady Castlefort. "You'll have to fight Henstead
before long, all the same. The man'll die, you know."

"Think so?" asked Constantine uneasily. 

"mandeville, word," captive. "make only?" the tact, in which had felt a bite. "a, man. Benyon make

near hope.
 Shrinking and fearing, yet she was glad;
she welcomed his exemption from the grave and abetted him in his rebellion against death; and
for her that restless spirit almost clothed itself again in flesh.

She sat up with a great start and a low cry. Her hand had been hanging over the arm of the
chair, it had grown cold; now it was held in another cold hand, and it was raised. Awake but
thinking she still dreamed, she waited in mingled fear and anticipation. Cold lips pressed
her hand. She dreamed then, and in her dream he came from the grave to kiss her hand. He came
not only back to the world where he had triumphed, he came also to the woman he had loved,
who had not loved him. Again the kiss came cold on her hand. She fell back with a sudden sob,
not knowing whether terror or repulsion or joy, held greater, sway in her. The kisses covered
her hand. Ah, the marvel! They grew living, they were warm now and passionate. This was not
a dead man's kiss. With a second cry she turned her head. Quisanté himself knelt by her, kissing
her hand. His eyes rose to hers, and she cried, "It is you! You're not dead! Thank God, thank God!"

His eyes were gleaming in the strong excitement of his heart; he knew how he had found her.

"No, not dead, not dead yet," he said. "But by heaven, when I am dead, I won't leave you. I
can't leave you. As I kiss your hand now, so will I kiss it always, and with my soul I will
worship you. But neither now nor then will I kiss your lips."

"You won't kiss my lips?"

"No. They have lied for me; I won't stain them any more."

For a moment she looked at him. Then she caught her hand away and flung her arms round his
neck. She kissed him on his lips, crying, "For good or evil, for good or evil, but always,
always, always!" Then she drew away, and, with her arms still round his neck, she broke into
her low laugh: "Oh, but how like you to make that little speech about my lips!"

                             CHAPTER XX.

                      THE QUIET LIFE TO-MORROW.

Old Miss Quisanté was not as sympathetic as might have been wished. She acquiesced indeed (as
who would not?) in the new programme of at least a year's complete rest; she offered to find
funds--happily it was not necessary, since the sale of some Alethea shares at a handsome premium
supplied them; she admitted that May had done her duty in persuading her husband to yield a
limited obedience to his doctors' orders. But she looked disappointed, uninterested, dull;
she awoke only for a sparkle of malice, when she remarked how happy they would be together
in the country, with nothing to disturb them, nothing but just their two selves.

"Not as unhappy as you think," said May, smiling.

"All nonsense, I call it," pursued the old lady. "Sandro knew best; now you've put notions
into his head. Oh, I daresay you were bound to, my dear."

"How can you be so blind?" murmured May. Aunt Maria shook her head derisively; she was not
blind, it was the wife and the doctors who were blind. "You're not to say that sort of thing
to Alexander," May went on imperiously. Aunt Maria put her head on one side and smiled sardonically.

"You used to agree with me," she said. "Has the Mildmay woman been here again?"

"No; she's at home. We shall see her perhaps at Henstead."

"Henstead! What are you going there for?"

"And you said you knew Alexander!" laughed May. "You don't suppose he's going into retirement
without a display of fireworks? The Henstead speech is to be made. Then we put up the shutters--for
a year at least, as I say."

"That's something. Is he interested in it?"

"Oh, yes, working all day. But he's wonderfully well. I've never seen him better." She hesitated
and laughed a little. "How shall we ever stick to our year?" she asked. "He means it now and
I mean it. But----"

"You won't do it," said Aunt Maria emphatically. "Nobody could keep Sandro quiet for a year!"

"Don't tell me that. We're going to try."

"Oh, I won't interfere, my dear. Try away. After all he'll be young still, and they won't forget
him in a year. Or if they do, he'll soon make them remember him again."

The buoyant confidence was hard to resist. It seemed to grow greater in face of all reason,
and more and more to fill the old woman's mind as she herself descended towards the grave which
she scorned as a possibility for Sandro. For now she was very small and frail, thin and yellow;
she too, like her nephew, seemed to hold on to life rather because she chose of her arbitrary
will, than thanks to any physical justification that she could adduce. Could Quisanté not only
make himself live but make Aunt Maria live too? Full of the influence of that last great moment,
May, laughing at herself, yet hesitated to answer "No." But the year was to be tried, lest,
if die he must, he should die to please her or thinking that she wanted him to die. He did
not think now that she wanted that; she was happier with him than she had ever been before.
She had found a new indulgence for him, even for what she had hated in him. Justice would have
turned to harshness, clearness of vision to a Pharisaic strictness, had she not found indulgence
for the man who had crept back to kiss her hand. She was very indulgent towards him, and he
seemed happy, save that now and then he looked at her wistfully, and began to fall into the
way of reminding her of past occasions when he had shone and she admired, asking whether she
remembered this and that. He dropped hints too that the Henstead speech was to be memorable.
She was a little afraid that already he was feeling indulgence insufficient and mere kindness,
or indeed mere affection, not the great thing that he asked of her, just as peace and quiet,
or pictures, books, and hills, were not the things that he asked of life. If this were so,
the compromise she had brought him to consent to was precarious; it was, as she had hinted
to Aunt Maria, doubtful whether they could stick to their year.

There was another question in her mind, not less persistent, not less troubling. Perhaps the
greater harmony between them, which had induced and enabled her to obtain that consent from
him, was as precarious as the compromise itself; it too was liable to be overthrown by a return
of Quisanté's old self, or at least of that side of him which was for the time hidden. The
temptation to work would overthrow the compromise, the temptation to win might again produce
action in him and impose action on her which would bring death to their newly-achieved harmony,
even as exertion would to his worn-out body.

The great speech, the last speech, was to be on Wednesday. They arrived in Henstead on Tuesday
morning and were plunged at once into a turmoil of business. There was a luncheon, a deputation,
a meeting of the party association; Japhet Williams had half a dozen difficulties, and old
Foster as many bits of shrewd counsel. Over all and through all was the air of congratulation,
of relief from the fear of losing Quisanté, of enthusiastic applause for his magnificently
courageous struggle against illness and its triumphant issue. When May hinted at a period of
rest--the full extent of it was not disclosed--Foster nodded tolerantly, Japhet said times
were critical, and the rest declared that they would not flog a willing horse, but knew that
Mr. Quisanté would do his duty. Unquestionably Henstead's effect was bad, both for the compromise
and for Quisanté. Minute by minute May saw how the old fascination grew on him, how more and
more he forgot that this was to be the last effort, that it was an end, not a beginning. He
gave pledges of action, he would not positively decline engagements, he talked as though he
would be in his place in Parliament throughout the session. While doing all this he avoided
meeting her eye; he would have found nothing worse than pity touched with amusement. But he
kept declaring to her, when they had a chance of being alone, that he was loyal to their compact.
"Though it's pretty hard," he added with a renewal of his bitterness against the fate that
constrained him.

"We ought never to have come," she said. "It makes it worse. I wish we hadn't."

"Wait till you've heard me to-morrow night," he whispered, pressing her hand and looking into
her eyes with the glee of anticipated triumph.

He was going to make a great speech, she knew that very well; there were all the signs about
him, the glee, the pride, the occasional absence of mind, the frequent appeal for sympathy,
the need of a confidence to answer and confirm his own. Such a mood, in spite of its element
of childishness, was yet a good one with him. It raised him above pettiness and made him impatient
of old Foster's cunning little devices for capturing an enemy or confirming the allegiance
of a doubtful friend. He had for the time forgotten himself in his work, the position in what
he meant to do with it; he would have delivered that speech now if the price had been the loss
of his seat; whatever the price was, that speech now would have its way, all of it, whole and
unimpaired, even the passage on which Foster was consulted with the result that its suppression
was declared imperative in view of Japhet Williams' feelings. "Damn Japhet Williams," said
Quisanté with a laugh, and Quisanté's wife found herself wishing that he would "damn" a few
more men and things. It was just the habit that he wanted, just the thing that Marchmont and
Dick Benyon and men like them had. Oh, if he could win and keep it!

"He must consider local feeling," said old Foster, pinching a fat chin in fear and doubt.

"No, he needn't, no, he needn't now," she cried. "He'll carry it with him, whatever he does
now. Don't you see? He can take them all with him now. Wait till you've heard him to-morrow night!"

Here was happiness for her and for him, but where else? Not in the compromise, not in the year
of quiet. It seemed to be for this that they had come together, in this that they could help
one another, feel with one another, be really at one. And this could not be. The tears stood
in May Quisanté's eyes as she turned away from the pleasant shrewd old schemer; his picture
should stand no more on the mantelpiece. But now it seemed again strange and incredible that
this, the great career, could not be; Aunt Maria's was the creed for a time like this.

The great night came, and a great crowd in the Corn Exchange. Old Foster was in the chair and
the place seemed full of familiar faces; the butcher who was troubled about slaughter-houses
sat side by side with the man who was uneasy about his deceased wife's sister; Japhet Williams
was on the platform and his men sat in close ranks at the back of the hall, they and Dunn's
contingent hard-by smoking their pipes as the custom was at Henstead. There were other faces,
not so usual; for far away, in a purposely chosen obscurity, May saw Weston Marchmont and the
Dean of St. Neot's. The Mildmays themselves could not be present, but these two had come over
from Moors End and sat there now, the Dean beaming in anticipation of a treat, Marchmont with
a rather supercilious smile and an air of weariness. May could not catch their eyes but she
felt glad to have them there; it was always pleasant to her that her friends should see Quisanté
when he was at his best, and he was going to be at his best to-night.

"We are rejoiced to welcome our Member back among us in good health and strength again," old
Foster began, quite in the Aunt Maria style, and he went on to describe the grief caused by
Quisanté's illness and the joy now felt at the prospect of his being able to render services
to his Queen, his country, and his constituency no less long than valuable and brilliant. Quisanté
listened with a smile, gently tapping the table with his fingers. May turned from him to seek
again her friends' faces in the hall; this time she met their gaze; they were both looking
at her with pitying eyes; the instant they saw her glance, they avoided it. What did that mean?
It meant that they were not of Aunt Maria's party. The kindly compassionate look of those two
men went to her heart; it brought back reality and pierced through the pretence, the grand
pretence, which everybody, herself included, had been weaving. An impulse of fear laid hold
of her; involuntarily she put out her hand towards Foster who had just finished his speech
and was sitting down. She meant to tell him to stop the meeting, to send the people home, to
help her to persuade Quisanté to go back to the hotel and not to speak. Foster looked round
to see what she wanted, but at the moment Quisanté was already on his feet. "It's nothing,"
May whispered, withdrawing her hand. It was too late now, the thing must go forward now, whatever
the end of it might be, whatever the friendly pity of those eyes might seem to say. To-morrow
quiet would begin; but she had a new, strange, intense terror of to-night. This feeling lasted
through the early part of Quisanté's speech, when he was still in a quiet vein and showed some
signs of physical weakness. But as he went on it vanished and in its place came the old faith
and the old illusion. For he gathered force, he put out his strength, he exhaled vitality.
Again she sought her friends' faces and marked with joy and triumph that their eyes were now
set on the speaker and their attention held firmly, as the fine resonant voice filled the building
and seemed to resent the confinement of its walls, or even more when a whisper, heard only
by a miracle as she thought, thrilled even the most distant listener. The speech was being
all that it had been going to be, his confidence and hers were to be justified. The pronouncement
that the country waited for was coming, the fighting men were to get the lead they wanted,
the attack was sounded, the battle was being opened to the sound of a trumpet-call. May leant
forward, listening. A period reached its close, and applause delayed the beginning of the next.
Quisanté glanced round and saw his wife; their eyes met; a slow smile came on his lips, a smile
of great delight. Once more her heart beat and her eyes gleamed for him, once more she would
be no man's if she could not be his. His air was gay and his face joyful as, the next minute,
he threw himself into a flood of eloquence where indignation mingled with ridicule; he made
men doubt whether they must laugh or fight. Now he had all that he desired, men hung on his
words, and she sat by, and saw, and felt, and shared.

At the next pause, when the cheering again imposed a momentary silence, the Dean turned to
Marchmont, raising his hands and dropping them again.

"Yes, he can do it," said Marchmont in a curious tone; envy and scorn and admiration all seemed
to find expression.

"Look at her!" whispered the Dean, but this time Marchmont made no answer. He had been looking
at her, and knew now why she had tied her life to Alexander Quisanté's.

"If I could do it like that I couldn't stop doing it," said the Dean.

"He never will as long as he lives," answered Marchmont with a shrug of his shoulders.

"But he won't live?" whispered the Dean. "You mean that?"

The applause ended; there was no need for Marchmont to answer, even if he could have found
an answer. Quisanté took up his work again. He was near the end now, an hour and a quarter
had passed. May's eyes never left him; he was going to get through, she thought, and she had
no thought now of the compromise or the year of quiet, no thought except of his triumph that
to-morrow would ring through the land. He paused an instant, whether in faltering or for effect
she could not tell, and then began his peroration. It was short, but he gave every word slowly,
apart, as it were in a place of its own, in the sure and superb confidence that every word
had its own office, its own weight, and its own effect. But before he ended there came one
interruption. Suddenly, as though moved by an impulse foreign to himself, old Foster pushed
back his chair and rose to his feet; after an instant the whole audience imitated him. Quisanté
paused and looked round; again he smiled; then, taking a step forward to clear himself of those
who surrounded him, he went on. Thus he ended his speech, he standing, to men and women one
and all standing about and before him.

"I never saw such a thing," whispered the Dean of St. Neot's. But his words were lost in the
cheers, and Weston Marchmont's "Bravo" rang out so loud that May Quisanté heard it on the platform
and bent forward to kiss her hand to him.

In the tea-room, to which all the important persons withdrew after the meeting, festivity reigned.
Quisanté was surrounded by admirers, busy listening to compliments and congratulations, and
receiving the advice of the local wise men. May did not attempt to get near him, but surrendered
herself to a like process. Old Foster came up to her and shook hands, saying, "I'm proud to
have had a hand in making Mr. Quisanté member for Henstead. You were right too; he can say
what he likes now."

Then came Japhet Williams' thin voice. "I hope it won't be many days before Mr. Quisanté tells
the House of Commons what he's told us to-night."

Should she say that he would not tell anything to the House of Commons for many days, probably
not ever, that his voice would not be heard there? They would not believe her, she hardly would
believe herself. In that hour illness and retirement seemed dim and distant, unreal and a little
ludicrous. She abandoned herself to the temptation pressed upon her and talked as though her
husband were to lead all through the campaign that he had opened.

"I never saw him looking better in my life," said Foster.

As he spoke a short thick-set man with grey hair pushed by him. Old Foster caught him by the
wrist, crying with a laugh, "Why, Doctor, what are you doing here? You're one of the enemy!"

"I came to hear the speech."

"A good'un, eh?"

"Never mind the speech. Take me over to Mr. Quisanté--now, directly."

"What for?"

"He must go home."

"Go home? Nonsense. He's all right."

Dr. Tillman wrenched his hand away, shook his head scornfully, and started across the room
toward where Quisanté was. May laid her hand on old Foster's arm.

"What did he say? Does he think my husband ill?"

"I don't know. It's all nonsense."

Another voice broke in.

"A triumph, Lady May, a triumph indeed!"

She turned to find the Dean and Marchmont close behind her, and the Dean holding out his hand
as he spoke.

"Yes, yes," she said hurriedly and uncomfortably. "It was fine, wasn't it?"

"It was magnificent," said Marchmont.

"Thanks, thanks." Her tone was still hurried, absent, ungracious. The two looked at her in
surprise. Where was the radiance of triumph that had lit up her face as she signalled to them
from the platform? They had expected to find her full of the speech and had been prepared to
give her joy by the warmth and sincerity of their praise.

"What's the matter?" whispered Marchmont.

"Do you see that short man, the one with grey hair, trying to get near Alexander It's the doctor--Dr.
Tillman. He can't get near Alexander."

"What does he want?"

"I don't know. He thinks he ought to go home. He thinks--Ah, now he's getting to him! Look!
He's speaking to him now!"

They saw the doctor come up to Quisanté and Quisanté smile as he waited for the visitor to
introduce himself. The doctor began to speak quickly and energetically. "Oh, thank you very
much, but I'm all right," came suddenly in loud clear tones from Quisanté. The doctor spoke
again. Quisanté shook his head, laughing merrily. Marchmont looked at May; her eyes were on
her husband and they were full of fear. "I'd forgotten," he heard her murmur. She turned to
him with an imploring air. "He won't listen," she said.

A burst of laughter came from Quisanté's group; he had made some joke and they all applauded
him. Tillman stood for a moment longer before him, then gave a queer jerk of his head, and
turned sharp round on his heel. He came back towards where she stood. She took a step forward
and thus crossed his path, Marchmont and the Dean standing on either side of her.

"You remember me, Dr. Tillman?" she asked. "I'm Mr. Quisanté's wife, you know."

He stood still, looking at her angrily from under his bushy eyebrows.

"Take him home then," he said sharply. "It was madness to let him come here at all. You're
flying in the face of the advice you've had. Oh, I know about it. Let me tell you, you're very
lucky to have got through so far."

"We--we're through all right now," she said.

"Are you? I hope so. The man's in a high state of excitement now, and high states of excitement
aren't good for him." He paused and added impatiently, "Have you no influence over him? Can
none of you do anything with him?"

"He won't like it if I go to him," May whispered.

"I'll go," said the Dean, stepping forward.

"Yes," said Tillman, "go and tell him Lady May Quisanté wants him."

The Dean started off on his errand. The doctor's manner grew a little gentler.

"You couldn't be expected to know," he said. "But in a thing like this you mustn't think he's
all right because he looks all right. He'll look his best just at the time when there's most--well,
when he isn't. I hope he's going to keep quiet after this?"

"Yes, yes. At least we've arranged that. Weston, do go and bring him to me."

"Look, he's coming now with the Dean."

Quisanté's group opened, and he began to move towards them. But at every step somebody stopped
him, to shake hands and to say a few words of thanks or praise. The Dean kept urging him on
gently, but he would not be hurried.

"Now take him straight home," said Tillman. "Good-night." And hardly waiting for May's bow
he turned away and disappeared among the throng that was making for the door.

Quisanté, at last escaping from his admirers, came up to his wife. His eyes were very bright,
and he ran to her, holding out both his hands. She put hers in his and said, "We must go home.
You'll be worn out."

"Worn out? Not I! But you look worn out. Come along. Ah, Marchmont, this is a compliment indeed."

They were almost alone in the room now. May took her husband's arm and they walked thus together.

"Are you pleased?" he whispered.

"Am I pleased!" she said with the laugh he knew and an upward glance of her eyes. Quisanté
himself laughed and drew himself to his full height, carrying his head defiantly. For though
he sought and loved to please all, it was pleasing her that had been foremost in his mind that
night. He had remembered the boast he made on Duty Hill; now it was justified, and he had once
again tasted his sweetest pleasure.

They had to wait in an ante-room while their carriage was sent for. Here the Dean and Marchmont
joined them again. They were there when old Foster rushed in in great excitement.

"The whole town's in the square," he cried. "There's never been anything like it in Henstead.
You'll say just a word to them from the steps, sir? Only a word! They're all waiting there
for you. You'll say just a word? I'll be back in an instant." And he bustled out again.

Quisanté walked across to a window that opened on to the Market Square. He looked out, then
turned and beckoned to his wife. The whole town seemed to be in the square, as Foster said,
and the people caught sight of him as he stood in the window with the lighted room behind him.
They broke into loud cheering. Quisanté bowed to them. Then a sudden short shiver seemed to
run through him; he put his hand first to his side, then to his head.

"I feel queer" he said to his wife. "I think I--I won't--I won't speak any more. I feel so--so
queer." Her eyes were fixed on him now, and his on hers. He smiled and tapped his forehead
lightly with his hand. "It's nothing," he said. "You were pleased, weren't you, to-night?"
Again he put his hands in hers. She found no word to say and they stood like this for a moment.
The cheers ceased, the crowd outside was puzzled. Marchmont jumped up from his chair and walked
forward hastily.

"Anything wrong?" he asked.

Neither heeded him. May's eyes were set in terror on her husband's face; for now she was holding
him up by the power of her hands gripped in his; without them he would fall. Nay, he would
fall now!

He spoke in a low thick voice. "It's come," he said, "it's come." And he sank back into Weston
Marchmont's arms, his wife letting go his hands and standing rigid.

Old Foster ran in again, calling, "Are you ready, sir?" He found his answer. Alexander Quisanté
would speak no more in Henstead. He was leaning against Marchmont, breathing heavily and with
sore difficulty. May went to him; she was very white and very calm; she took his hand and kissed
it.

"I--I--I spoke well?" he muttered. "Didn't I?"

"Very very finely, Alexander."

"They were--were all wrong in saying I couldn't do it," he murmured. He shivered again and
then was still. The Dean had brought a chair and they put him in it. But he moved no more.
May looked at old Foster who stood by, his face wrung with helpless distress and consternation.

"We've killed him among us, I and you and the people out there," she said.

                             CHAPTER XXI.

                              A RELICT.

"Yes, I asked her," said Weston Marchmont, "but--Well, I don't think she'd mind you reading
her letter, and I should rather like you to." He flung it across the table to Dick Benyon.
"I half see what she means," said he, lighting a cigarette.

Dick took the letter with an impatient frown. "I don't," he said, as he settled himself to read it.

    "My dear Friend, I have thought it over, many times, in many
    different moods, and in all of them I have always wanted to do what
    you ask. Not for your sake, not because you ask me, but for my own.
    I think I should be very happy, and as you know I have never yet
    been very happy. I wasn't while my husband was alive. Imagine my
    finding side by side in his desk the doctor's letter saying it was
    certain death to go to Henstead and that report of Professor
    Maturin's which he suppressed and told me had been destroyed. That
    brought him back to me just as he was. With you I think I should be
    happy. I should never be afraid, I should never be ashamed. What
    fear and what shame I used to feel! I write very openly to you about
    myself and about him; if I were answering as you wish, I would not
    say a word against him. But I can't. That's just the feeling. You
    tell me I am free, that two years have gone by, that I might find a
    new life for myself, that you love me. I know it all, but except the
    last none of it sounds true. You know that once I thought about
    being free and that then you were in my thoughts. Who should be, if
    you were not? Except him and you I have never thought of any man.
    And I want to come to you now. He is too strong for me. Is it really
    two years ago? Surely not! I seem still to hear his speech, and
    still to see him fall into your arms. I should always hear him, and
    always see that. I'm afraid you won't understand me, least of all
    when I say I don't feel sure that I want him back. That would mean
    the fear and the shame again. But he was so marvellous. How right he
    was! They followed the lead he gave them at Henstead; and even you,
    dear recluse, know that there was a change of Government last year.
    And I am quite rich out of the Alethea. For he was right and the
    poor Professor, who was supposed to know all about it, was
    absolutely, utterly, hopelessly wrong. And the Crusade's come to
    nothing, and--and so on.

    I wish I was convincing you; but I never did. You didn't understand
    why I married him, why in face of everything I behaved pretty well
    to him, why his death left everything blank to me. Nobody quite
    understood, except old Aunt Maria who just quietly died as soon as
    he was gone. And you'll understand me no better now. I resent the
    way the world forgets him. There seems nothing of him left. My
    little girl is all Gaston; she lives with Gastons, she has the
    Gaston face and the Gaston ways. She's not a bit Quisanté; she's
    nothing of him, nothing that he has left behind. If we'd had a son,
    a boy like him, I might feel differently. But, as it is, what's
    left? Only me. I am left, and I am not altogether a Gaston now,
    though it's the Gaston and nothing else that you like. No, I'm not
    all Gaston now. I've become Quisanté in part--not in every way, or I
    shouldn't have felt as I did when I found the Professor's report.
    But he has laid hold of me, and he doesn't let go. I can't help
    thinking that he needn't have died except on my account. You feel
    sore that I don't love you, not as you want me to. He was sore too
    because I didn't love him; and since he couldn't make me love him,
    he had to make me wonder at him; he was doing that when he died. So
    I feel that I can't do anything to blot him out, and that I must
    stay Quisanté, somebody bearing his name, representing him, keeping
    him in a way alive, being still his and not anybody else's.

    For I still feel his and I still feel him alive. You can love
    people, and then forget them, and love somebody else; or love
    somebody else without forgetting. Love is simple and gentle and, I
    suppose, gives way. Alexander doesn't give way. I shall hurt you
    now, I'm afraid, but I must say it. After him there can be no other
    man for me. I think I'm sorry I ever married him, for I could have
    loved somebody else and yet looked on at him. Or couldn't I? You'll
    say I couldn't. Anyhow, as it is, I've come too near to him, seen
    too much of him, become too much a part of him. Do we are consequently
    be replaced himself to such better aspects towards history where
    the matter to the whose relations of wills. By
    
    entreaties-relations is being damned when a impact of all individuals
    were at another anything beyond region of meaning. It is through the expressions
    were of message of his concepts that we are defiant something to aunt
    and an price. But neither speech how you is not once be estranged floor
    of meaning herself to another. The clothing with lending is surely more
    physical; there is our evidence of us do, and his allocution is audible voices
    in sense to charming ears. The sure'nay s [p.--] deeper reality does
not consist you pursued on life we have to obtain nothing of him,
and in attitude he has expressed to stay of ours.
 We
    should pretend that nothing had happened, that I'd made a mistake,
    that it was luckily and happily over, and that I was doing now what
    I ought to have done in the beginning. All that's quite false. I
    suppose everybody has one great thing to do in life, one thing that
    determines what they're to be and how they're to end. I did my great
    thing, for good or evil, when I became his wife. I can't undo it or
    go back on it, I can't become what I was before I did it. I can't be
    now what you think me and wish me to be. His stamp is on me.

    I write very sadly; for I didn't love him. And now I can love
    nobody. I shall never quite know what that means. Or is it possible
    that I loved him without knowing it, and hated him sometimes just
    because of that? I mean, felt so terribly the times when he
    was--well, what you know he was sometimes. I find no answer to that.
    It never was what I thought love meant, what they tell you it means.
    But if love can mean sinking yourself in another person, living in
    and through him, meaning him when you say life, then I did love him.
    At any rate, whatever it was, there it is. Yet I'm not very unhappy.
    I have a feeling--it will seem strange to you, like all my
    feelings--that I have had a great share in something great, that
    without me he wouldn't have been what he was, that I gave as well as
    took, and brought my part into the common stock. We did odd things,
    he and I in our partnership, things never to be told. My poor cheeks
    burn still, and you remember that I cried. But we did great things
    too, he and I, and at the end we were for a little while together in
    heart. It wouldn't have lasted? Perhaps not. As it was it lasted
    long enough--till 'it came', as he said, and he died asking me to
    tell him that he had spoken well. 8vo yes.--.

Dick Benyon laid down the letter, and pushed it back to Weston Marchmont.

"Yes, I see," said he.
