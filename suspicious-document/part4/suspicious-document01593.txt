'Spoke of the modern tendency to pure theism, and met the objection that it retards improvement
by turning the minds of some of the best men from social affairs, by the counter-proposition
that it is useful to society, apart from the question of its truth,--useful as a provisional
belief, because people will identify serviceable ministry to men with service of God. Thinks
we cannot with any sort of precision define the coming modification of religion, but anticipates
that it will undoubtedly rest upon the solidarity of mankind, as Comte said, and as you and
I believe. Perceives two things, at any rate, which are likely to lead men to invest this with
the moral authority of a religion; first, they will become more and more impressed by the awful
fact that a piece of conduct to-day may prove a curse to men and women scores and even hundreds
of years after the author of it is dead; and second, they will more and more feel that they
can only satisfy their sentiment of gratitude to seen or unseen benefactors, can only repay
the untold benefits they have inherited, by diligently maintaining the traditions of service.

'And so forth, full of interest and suggestiveness all through. When he got here, he chatted
to R---- over our lunch, with something of the simple amiableness of a child, about the wild
flowers, the ways of insects, and notes of birds. He was impatient for the song of the nightingale.
Then I drove him to our little roadside station, and one of the most delightful days of my
life came to its end, like all other days, delightful and sorrowful.'

Alas, the sorrowful day which ever dogs our delight followed very quickly. The nightingale
that he longed for fills the darkness with music, but not for the ear of the dead master: he
rests in the deeper darkness where the silence is unbroken for ever. We may console ourselves
with the reflection offered by the dying Socrates to his sorrowful companions: he who has arrayed
the soul in her own proper jewels of moderation and justice and courage and nobleness and truth,
is ever ready for the journey when his time comes. We have lost a great teacher and example
of knowledge and virtue, but men will long feel the presence of his character about them, making
them ashamed of what is indolent or selfish, and encouraging them to all disinterested labour,
both in trying to do good and in trying to find out what the good is,--which is harder.

MR. MILL'S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.

Chercher en gémissant--search with many sighs--that was Pascal's notion of praiseworthy living
and choosing the better part. Search, and search with much travail, strikes us as the chief
intellectual ensign and device of that eminent man whose record of his own mental nurture and
growth we have all been reading. Everybody endowed with energetic intelligence has a measure
of the spirit of search poured out upon him. All such persons act on the Socratic maxim that
the life without inquiry is a life to be lived by no man. But it is the rare distinction of
a very few to accept the maxim in its full significance, to insist on an open mind as the true
secret of wisdom, to press the examination and testing of our convictions as the true way at
once to stability and growth of character, and thus to make of life what it is so good for
us that it should be, a continual building up, a ceaseless fortifying and enlargement and multiplication
of the treasures of the spirit.

[Footnote 2: Mill's Autobiography, 242.]

The men to whom this is the ideal of the life of the reason, and who have done anything considerable
towards spreading a desire after it, deserve to have their memories gratefully cherished even
by those who do not agree with all their positive opinions. We need only to reflect a little
on the conditions of human existence; on the urgent demand which material necessities inevitably
make on so immense a proportion of our time and thought; on the space which is naturally filled
up by the activity of absorbing affections; on the fatal power of mere tradition and report
over the indifferent, and the fatal power of inveterate prejudice over so many even of the
best of those who are not indifferent. Then we shall know better how to value such a type of
character and life as Mr. Mill has now told us the story of, in which intellectual impressionableness
on the most important subjects of human thought was so cultivated as almost to acquire the
strength and quick responsiveness of emotional sensibility. And this, without the too common
drawback to great openness of mind. This drawback consists in loose beliefs, taken up to-day
and silently dropped to-morrow; vacillating opinions, constantly being exchanged for their
contraries; feeble convictions, appearing, shifting, vanishing, in the quicksands of an unstable
mind.

Nobody will impute any of these disastrous weaknesses to Mr. Mill. His impressionableness was
of the valuable positive kind, which adds and assimilates new elements from many quarters,
without disturbing the organic structure of the whole. This careful and conscientious recognition
of the duty of having ordered opinions, and of responsibility for these opinions being both
as true and as consistent with one another as taking pains with his mind could make them, distinguished
Mr. Mill from the men who flit aimlessly from doctrine to doctrine, as the flies of a summer
day dart from point to point in the vacuous air. It distinguished him also from those sensitive
spirits who fling themselves down from the heights of rationalism suddenly into the pit of
an infallible church; and from those who, like La Mennais, move violently between faith and
reason, between tradition and inquiry, between the fulness of deference to authority and the
fulness of individual self-assertion.

All minds of the first quality move and grow; they have a susceptibility to many sorts of new
impressions, a mobility, a feeling outwards, which makes it impossible for them to remain in
the stern fixity of an early implanted set of dogmas, whether philosophic or religious. In
stoical tenacity of character, as well as in intellectual originality and concentrated force
of understanding, some of those who knew both tell us that Mr. Mill was inferior to his father.
But who does not feel in the son the serious charm of a power of adaptation and pliableness
which we can never associate with the hardy and more rigorous nature of the other? And it was
just because he had this sensibility of the intellect, that the history of what it did for
him is so edifying a performance for a people like ourselves, among whom that quality is so
extremely uncommon. For it was the sensibility of strength and not of weakness, nor of mere
over-refinement and subtlety. We may estimate the significance of such a difference, when we
think how little, after all, the singular gifts of a Newman or a Maurice have done for their
contemporaries, simply because these two eminent men allowed consciousness of their own weakness
to 'sickly over' the spontaneous impulses of their strength.

The wonder is that the reaction against such an education as that through which James Mill
brought his son,--an education so intense, so purely analytical, doing so much for the reason
and so little for the satisfaction of the affections,--was not of the most violent kind. The
wonder is that the crisis through which nearly every youth of good quality has to pass, and
from which Mr. Mill, as he has told us, by no means escaped, did not land him in some of the
extreme forms of transcendentalism. If it had done so the record of the journey would no doubt
have been more abundant in melodramatic incidents. It would have done more to tickle the fancy
of 'the present age of loud disputes but weak convictions.' And it might have been found more
touching by the large numbers of talkers and writers who seem to think that a history of a
careful man's opinions on grave and difficult subjects ought to have all the rapid movements
and unexpected turns of a romance, and that a book without rapture and effusion and a great
many capital letters must be joyless and disappointing. Those of us who dislike literary hysteria
as much as we dislike the coarseness that mistakes itself for force, may well be glad to follow
the mental history of a man who knew how to move and grow without any of these reactions and
leaps on the one hand, or any of that overdone realism on the other, which may all make a more
striking picture, but which do assuredly more often than not mark the ruin of a mind and the
nullification of a career.

If we are now and then conscious in the book of a certain want of spacing, of changing perspectives
and long vistas; if we have perhaps a sense of being too narrowly enclosed; if we miss the
relish of humour or the occasional relief of irony; we ought to remember that we are busy not
with a work of imagination or art, but with the practical record of the formation of an eminent
thinker's mental habits and the succession of his mental attitudes. The formation of such mental
habits is not a romance, but the most arduous of real concerns. If we are led up to none of
the enkindled summits of the soul, and plunged into none of its abysses, that is no reason
why we should fail to be struck by the pale flame of strenuous self-possession, or touched
by the ingenuousness and simplicity of the speaker's accents. A generation continually excited
by narratives, as sterile as vehement, of storm and stress and spiritual shipwreck, might do
well, if it knew the things that pertained to its peace, to ponder this unvarnished history--the
history of a man who, though he was not one of the picturesque victims of the wasteful torments
of an uneasy spiritual self-consciousness, yet laboured so patiently after the gifts of intellectual
strength, and did so much permanently to widen the judgments of the world.

If Mr. Mill's Autobiography has no literary grandeur, nor artistic variety, it has the rarer
merit of presenting for our contemplation a character that was infested by none of the smaller
passions, and warped by none of the more unintelligent attitudes of the human mind. We have
to remember that it is exactly these, the smaller passions on the one hand, and slovenliness
of intelligence on the other, which are even worse agencies in spoiling the worth of life and
the advance of society than the more imposing vices either of thought or sentiment. Many have
told the tale of a life of much external eventfulness. It is true that this mental habit is
not so singular in itself, for it is the common and indispensable merit of every truly scientific
thinker. Mr. Mill's distinction lay in the deliberate intention and the systematic patience
with which he brought it to the consideration of moral and religious and social subjects. In
this region hitherto, for reasons that are not difficult to seek, the empire of prejudice and
passion has been so much stronger, so much harder to resist, than in the field of physical science.

Sect is so ready to succeed sect, and school comes after school, with constant replacement
of one sort of orthodoxy by another sort, until even the principle of relativity becomes the
base of a set of absolute and final dogmas, and the very doctrine of uncertainty itself becomes
fixed in a kind of authoritative nihilism. It is, therefore, a signal gain that we now have
a new type, with the old wise device, [Greek: memnêso apistein]--be sure that you distrust.
Distrust your own bias; distrust your supposed knowledge; constantly try, prove, fortify your
firmest convictions. And all this, throughout the whole domain where the intelligence rules.
It was characteristic of a man of this type that he should have been seized by that memorable
passage in Condorcet's Life of Turgot to which Mr. Mill refers (p. 114), and which every man
with an active interest in serious affairs should bind about his neck and write on the tablets
of his heart.

'Turgot,' says his wise biographer, 'always looked upon anything like a sect as mischievous....
From the moment that a sect comes into existence, all the individuals composing it become answerable
for the faults and errors of each one of them. The obligation to remain united leads them to
suppress or dissemble all truths that might wound anybody whose adhesion is useful to the sect.
They are forced to establish in some form a body of doctrine, and the opinions which make a
part of it, being adopted without inquiry, become in due time pure prejudices. Friendship stops
with the individuals; but the hatred and envy that any of them may arouse extends to the whole
sect. If this sect be formed by the most enlightened men of the nation, if the defence of truths
of the greatest importance to the common happiness be the object of its zeal, the mischief
is still worse. Everything true or useful which they propose is rejected without examination.
Abuses and errors of every kind always have for their defenders that herd of presumptuous and
mediocre mortals, who are the bitterest enemies of all celebrity and renown. Scarcely is a
truth made clear, before those to whom it would be prejudicial crush it under the name of a
sect that is sure to have already become odious, and are certain to keep it from obtaining
so much as a hearing. Turgot, then, was persuaded that perhaps the greatest ill you can do
to truth is to drive those who love it to form themselves into a sect, and that these in turn
can commit no more fatal mistake than to have the vanity or the weakness to fall into the trap.'

Yet we know that with Mr. Mill as with Turgot this deep distrust of sect was no hindrance to
the most careful systematisation of opinion and conduct. He did not interpret many-sidedness
in the flaccid watery sense which flatters the indolence of so many of our contemporaries,
who like to have their ears amused with a new doctrine each morning, to be held for a day,
and dropped in the evening, and who have little more seriousness in their intellectual life
than the busy insects of a summer noon. This was in some sort the type at which he aimed in
the formation of his own character--a type that should combine organic with critical quality,
the strength of an ordered set of convictions, with that pliability and that receptiveness
in face of new truth, which are indispensable to these very convictions being held intelligently
and in their best attainable form. We can understand the force of the eulogy on John Austin
(p. 154), that he manifested 'an equal devotion to the two cardinal points of Liberty and Duty.'
These are the correlatives in the sphere of action to the two cardinal points of Criticism
and Belief in the sphere of thought.

We can in the light of this double way of viewing the right balance of the mind, the better
understand the combination of earnestness with tolerance which inconsiderate persons are apt
to find so awkward a stumbling-block in the scheme of philosophic liberalism. Many people in
our time have so ill understood the doctrine of liberty, that in some of the most active circles
in society they now count you a bigot if you hold any proposition to be decidedly and unmistakably
more true than any other. They pronounce you intemperate if you show anger and stern disappointment
because men follow the wrong course instead of the right one. Mr. Mill's explanation of the
vehemence and decision of his father's disapproval, when he did disapprove, and his refusal
to allow honesty of purpose in the doer to soften his disapprobation of the deed, gives the
reader a worthy and masculine notion of true tolerance. This is another side of the co-ordination
of Criticism and Belief, of Liberty and Duty, which attained in Mr. Mill himself a completeness
that other men, less favoured in education and with less active power of self-control, are
not likely to reach, but to reach it ought to be one of the prime objects of their mental discipline.
The inculcation of this peculiar morality of the intelligence is one of the most urgently needed
processes of our time. For the circumstance of our being in the very depths of a period of
transition from one spiritual basis of thought to another, leads men not only to be content
with holding a quantity of vague, confused, and contradictory opinions, but also to invest
with the honourable name of candour a weak reluctance to hold any one of them earnestly.

Mr. Mill experienced in the four or five last years of his life the disadvantage of trying
to unite fairness towards the opinions from which he differed, with loyalty to the positive
opinions which he accepted. This was only one illustration of what constantly happened, until
at length, it is hardly too much to say, a man who had hitherto enjoyed a singular measure
of general reverence because he was supposed to see truth in every doctrine, became downright
unpopular among many classes in the community, because he saw more truth in one doctrine than
another, and brought the propositions for whose acceptance he was most in earnest eagerly before
the public.

 People who think seriously of life and its conditions either are content with
those conditions as they exist, or else they find them empty and deeply unsatisfying. Well,
the former class, who naturally figure prominently in the public press, because the press is
the more or less flattering mirror of the prevailing doctrines of the day, think that Mr. Mill's
views of a better social future are chimerical, utopian, and sentimental. The latter class
compensate themselves for the pinchedness of the real world about them by certain rapturous
ideals, centring in God, a future life, and the long companionship of the blessed. The consequence
of this absorption either in the immediate interests and aims of the hour, or in the interests
and aims of an imaginary world which is supposed to await us after death, has been a hasty
inclination to look on such a life and such purposes as are set forth in the Autobiography
as essentially jejune and dreary. It is not in the least surprising that such a feeling should
prevail. Lionel, the points, less low, had regarded her for he had been possibly,
shaking his character.

Then Mr. Mill's life as disclosed to us in these pages has been called joyless, by that sect
of religious partisans whose peculiarity is to mistake boisterousness for unction. Was the
life of Christ himself, then, so particularly joyful? Can the life of any man be joyful who
sees and feels the tragic miseries and hardly less tragic follies of the earth? The old Preacher,
when he considered all the oppressions that are done under the sun, and beheld the tears of
such as were oppressed and had no comforter, therefore praised the dead which are already dead
more than the living which are yet alive, and declared him better than both, which hath not
yet been, who hath not seen the evil work that is done under the sun. Those who are willing
to trick their understandings and play fast and loose with words may, if they please, console
themselves with the fatuous commonplaces of a philosophic optimism. They may, with eyes tight
shut, cling to the notion that they live in the best of all possible worlds, or discerning
all the anguish that may be compressed into threescore years and ten, still try to accept the
Stoic's paradox that pain is not an evil. Or, most wonderful and most common of all, they may
find this joy of which they talk, in meditating on the moral perfections of the omnipotent
Being for whose diversion the dismal panorama of all the evil work done under the sun was bidden
to unfold itself, and who sees that it is very good. Those who are capable of a continuity
of joyous emotion on these terms may well complain of Mr. Mill's story as dreary; and so may
the school of Solomon, who commended mirth because a man hath no better thing than to eat and
to drink and to be merry. People, however, who are prohibited by their intellectual conditions
from finding full satisfaction either in spiritual raptures or in pleasures of sense, may think
the standard of happiness which Mr. Mill sought and reached, not unacceptable and not unworthy
of being diligently striven after.

Mr. Mill's conception of happiness in life is more intelligible if we contrast it with his
father's. The Cynic element in James Mill, as his son now tells us (pg. Golden, from an bitthead
of the instrument, we state, therefore, "Title. immature, can i did

We thus see how far from dreary this wise and benign man actually found his own life; how full
it was of cheerfulness, of animation, of persevering search, of a tranquillity lighted up at
wholesome intervals by flashes of intellectual and moral excitement. That it was not seldom
crossed by moods of despondency is likely enough, but we may at least be sure that these moods
had nothing in common with the vulgar despondency of those whose hopes are centred in material
prosperity in this world and spiritual prosperity in some other. They were, at least, the dejection
of a magnanimous spirit, that could only be cast down by some new hindrance to the spread of
reason and enlightenment among men, or some new weakening of their incentives to right doing.

Much has been said against Mr. Mill's strictures on society, and his withdrawal from it. If
we realise the full force of all that he says of his own purpose in life, it is hard to see
