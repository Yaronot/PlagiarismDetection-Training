"THE FIDDLE AND THE BOW."

I heard a great master play on the wondrous violin; his bow quivered like the wing of a bird;
in every quiver there was a melody, and every melody breathed a thought in language sweeter
than was ever uttered by human tongue. I was conjured, I was mesmerized by his music. I thought
I fell asleep under its power, and was rapt into the realm of visions and dreams. The enchanted
violin broke out in tumult, and through the rifted shadows in my dream I thought I saw old
ocean lashed to fury. The wing of the storm-god brooded above it, dark and lowering with night
and tempest and war. I heard the shriek of the angry hurricane, the loud rattling musketry
of rain, and hail, and the louder and deadlier crash and roar of the red artillery on high.
Its rumbling batteries, unlimbered on the vapory heights and manned by the fiery gunners of
the storm, boomed their volleying thunders to the terrible rythm of the strife below. And in
every stroke of the bow fierce lightnings leaped down from their dark pavilions of cloud, and,
like armed angels of light, flashed their trenchant blades among the phantom squadrons marshalling
for battle on the field of the deep. I heard the bugle blast and battle cry of the charging
winds, wild and exultant, and then I saw the billowy monsters rise, like an army of Titans,
to scale and carry the hostile heights of heaven. Assailing again and again, as often hurled
back headlong into the ocean's abyss, they rolled, and surged, and writhed, and raged, till
the affrighted earth trembled at the uproar of the warring elements. I saw the awful majesty
and might of Jehovah flying on the wings of the tempest, planting his footsteps on the trackless
deep, veiled in darkness and in clouds. There was a shifting of the bow; the storm died away
in the distance, and the morning broke in floods of glory. Then the violin revived and poured
out its sweetest soul. In its music I heard the rustle of a thousand joyous wings, and a burst
of song from a thousand joyous throats. Mockingbirds and linnets thrilled the glad air with
warblings; gold finches, thrushes and bobolinks trilled their happiest tunes; and the oriole
sang a lullaby to her hanging cradle that rocked in the wind. I heard the twitter of skimming
swallows and the scattered covey's piping call; I heard the robin's gay whistle, the croaking
of crows, the scolding of blue-jays, and the melancholy cooing of a dove. The swaying tree-tops
seemed vocal with bird-song while he played, and the labyrinths of leafy shade echoed back
the chorus. Then the violin sounded the hunter's horn, and the deep-mouthed pack of fox hounds
opened loud and wild, far in the ringing woods, and it was like the music of a hundred chiming
bells.
