ON HORSEBACK

By Charles Dudley Warner

I

"The way to mount a horse"--said the Professor.

"If you have no ladder--put in the Friend of Humanity."

The Professor had ridden through the war for the Union on the right side, enjoying a much better
view of it than if he had walked, and knew as much about a horse as a person ought to know
for the sake of his character. The man who can recite the tales of the Canterbury Pilgrims,
on horseback, giving the contemporary pronunciation, never missing an accent by reason of the
trot, and at the same time witch North Carolina and a strip of East Tennessee with his noble
horsemanship, is a kind of Literary Centaur of whose double instruction any Friend of Humanity
may be glad to avail himself.

"The way to mount a horse is to grasp the mane with the left hand holding the bridle-rein,
put your left foot in the stirrup, with the right hand on the back of the saddle, and---"

Just then the horse stepped quickly around on his hind feet, and looked the Professor in the
face. The Superintendents of Affairs, who occupy the flagging in front of the hotel, seated
in cane-bottomed chairs tilted back, smiled. These useful persons appear to have a life-lease
of this portion of the city pavement, and pretty effectually block it up nearly all day and
evening. When a lady wishes to make her way through the blockade, it is the habit of these
observers of life to rise and make room, touching their hats, while she picks her way through,
and goes down the street with a pretty consciousness of the flutter she has caused. The war
has not changed the Southern habit of sitting out-of-doors, but has added a new element of
street picturesqueness in groups of colored people lounging about the corners. There appears
to be more leisure than ever.

The scene of this little lesson in horsemanship was the old town of Abingdon, in southwest
Virginia, on the Virginia and East Tennessee railway; a town of ancient respectability, which
gave birth to the Johnstons and Floyds and other notable people; a town, that still preserves
the flavor of excellent tobacco and, something of the easy-going habits of the days of slavery,
and is a sort of educational center, where the young ladies of the region add the final graces
of intellectual life in moral philosophy and the use of the globes to their natural gifts.
The mansion of the late and left Floyd is now a seminary, and not far from it is the Stonewall
Jackson Institute, in the midst of a grove of splendid oaks, whose stately boles and wide-spreading
branches give a dignity to educational life. The distinction of the region is its superb oak-trees.
As it was vacation in these institutions of learning, the travelers did not see any of the
vines that traditionally cling to the oak.

The Professor and the Friend of Humanity were about starting on a journey, across country southward,
through regions about which the people of Abingdon could give little useful information. If
the travelers had known the capacities and resources of the country, they would not have started
without a supply train, or the establishment of bases of provisions in advance. But, as the
Professor remarked, knowledge is something that one acquires when he has no use for it. The
horses were saddled; the riders were equipped with flannel shirts and leather leggings; the
saddle-bags were stuffed with clean linen, and novels, and sonnets of Shakespeare, and other
baggage, it would have been well if they had been stuffed with hard-tack, for in real life
meat is more than raiment.

The hotel, in front of which there is cultivated so much of what the Germans call sitzfleisch,
is a fair type of the majority of Southern hotels, and differs from the same class in the North
in being left a little more to run itself. The only information we obtained about it was from
its porter at the station, who replied to the question, "Is it the best?" "We warrant you perfect
satisfaction in every respect." This seems to be only a formula of expression, for we found
that the statement was highly colored. It was left to our imagination to conjecture how the
big chambers of the old house, with their gaping fireplaces, might have looked when furnished
and filled with gay company, and we got what satisfaction we could out of a bygone bustle and
mint-julep hilarity. In our struggles with the porter to obtain the little items of soap, water,
and towels, we were convinced that we had arrived too late, and that for perfect satisfaction
we should have been here before the war. It was not always as now. In colonial days the accommodations
and prices at inns were regulated by law. In the old records in the court-house we read that
if we had been here in 1777, we could have had a gallon of good rum for sixteen shillings;
a quart bowl of rum toddy made with loaf sugar for two shillings, or with brown sugar for one
shilling and sixpence. In 1779 prices had risen. Good rum sold for four pounds a gallon. It
was ordered that a warm dinner should cost twelve shillings, a cold dinner nine shillings,
and a good breakfast twelve shillings. But the item that pleased us most, and made us regret
our late advent, was that for two shillings we could have had a "good lodging, with clean sheets."
The colonists were fastidious people.

Abingdon, prettily situated on rolling hills, and a couple of thousand feet above the sea,
with views of mountain peaks to the south, is a cheerful and not too exciting place for a brief
sojourn, and hospitable and helpful to the stranger. We had dined--so much, at least, the public
would expect of us--with a descendant of Pocahontas; we had assisted on Sunday morning at the
dedication of a new brick Methodist church, the finest edifice in the region--a dedication
that took a long time, since the bishop would not proceed with it until money enough was raised
in open meeting to pay the balance due on it: a religious act, though it did give a business
aspect to the place at the time; and we had been the light spots in the evening service at
the most aristocratic church of color. The irresponsibility of this amiable race was exhibited
in the tardiness with which they assembled: at the appointed time nobody was there except the
sexton; it was three quarters of an hour before the congregation began to saunter in, and the
sermon was nearly over before the pews were at all filled. Perhaps the sermon was not new,
but it was fervid, and at times the able preacher roared so that articulate sounds were lost
in the general effect. It was precisely these passages of cataracts of sound and hard breathing
which excited the liveliest responses,--"Yes, Lord," and "Glory to God." Most of these responses
came from the "Amen corner." The sermon contained the usual vivid description of the last judgment--ah,
and I fancied that the congregation did not get the ordinary satisfaction out of it. Fashion
had entered the fold, and the singing was mostly executed by a choir in the dusky gallery,
who thinly and harshly warbled the emotional hymns. Iii. The state'the information let we in shame,

 Our horses were only fair walkers. We realized how necessary this accomplishment
is, for between the Tennessee line and Asheville, North Carolina, there is scarcely a mile
of trotting-ground.

We soon turned southward and descended into the Holston River Valley. Beyond lay the Tennessee
hills and conspicuous White-Top Mountain (5530 feet), which has a good deal of local celebrity
(standing where the States of Virginia, Tennessee, and North Carolina corner), and had been
pointed out to us at Abingdon. We had been urged, personally and by letter, to ascend this
mountain, without fail. People recommend mountains to their friends as they do patent medicines.
As we leisurely jogged along we discussed this, and endeavored to arrive at some rule of conduct
for the journey. The Professor expressed at once a feeling about mountain-climbing that amounted
to hostility,--he would go nowhere that he could not ride. Climbing was the most unsatisfactory
use to which a mountain could be put. As to White-Top, it was a small mountain, and not worth
ascending. The Friend of Humanity, who believes in mountain-climbing as a theory, and for other
people, and knows the value of being able to say, without detection, that he has ascended any
high mountain about which he is questioned,--since this question is the first one asked about
an exploration in a new country,--saw that he should have to use a good deal of diplomacy to
get the Professor over any considerable elevation on the trip. And he had to confess also that
a view from a mountain is never so satisfactory as a view of a mountain, from a moderate height.
The Professor, however, did not argue the matter on any such reasonable ground, but took his
stand on his right as a man not to ascend a mountain. With this appeal to first principles,--a
position that could not be confuted on account of its vagueness (although it might probably
be demonstrated that in society man has no such right), there was no way of agreement except
by a compromise. It was accordingly agreed that no mountain under six thousand feet is worth
ascending; that disposed of White-Top. It was further agreed that any mountain that is over
six thousand feet high is too high to ascend on foot.

With this amicable adjustment we forded the Holston, crossing it twice within a few miles.
This upper branch of the Tennessee is a noble stream, broad, with a rocky bed and a swift current.
Fording it is ticklish business except at comparatively low water, and as it is subject to
sudden rises, there must be times when it seriously interrupts travel. This whole region, full
of swift streams, is without a bridge, and, as a consequence, getting over rivers and brooks
and the dangers of ferries occupy a prominent place in the thoughts of the inhabitants. The
life necessarily had the "frontier" quality all through, for there can be little solid advance
in civilization in the uncertainties of a bridgeless condition. An open, pleasant valley, the
Holston, but cultivation is more and more negligent and houses are few and poorer as we advance.

We had left behind the hotels of "perfect satisfaction," and expected to live on the country,
trusting to the infrequent but remunerated hospitality of the widely scattered inhabitants.
We were to dine at Ramsey's. Ramsey's had been recommended to us as a royal place of entertainment
the best in all that region; and as the sun grew hot in the sandy valley, and the weariness
of noon fell upon us, we magnified Ramsey's in our imagination,--the nobility of its situation,
its cuisine, its inviting restfulness,--and half decided to pass the night there in the true
abandon of plantation life. Long before we reached it, the Holston River which we followed
had become the Laurel, a most lovely, rocky, winding stream, which we forded continually, for
the valley became too narrow much of the way to accommodate a road and a river. Eagerly as
we were looking out for it, we passed the great Ramsey's without knowing it, for it was the
first of a little settlement of two houses and a saw-mill and barn. It was a neat log house
of two lower rooms and a summer kitchen, quite the best of the class that we saw, and the pleasant
mistress of it made us welcome. Across the road and close, to the Laurel was the spring-house,
the invariable adjunct to every well-to-do house in the region, and on the stony margin of
the stream was set up the big caldron for the family washing; and here, paddling in the shallow
stream, while dinner was preparing, we established an intimacy with the children and exchanged
philosophical observations on life with the old negress who was dabbling the clothes. What
impressed this woman was the inequality in life. She jumped to the unwarranted conclusion that
the Professor and the Friend were very rich, and spoke with asperity of the difficulty she
experienced in getting shoes and tobacco. It was useless to point out to her that her alfresco
life was singularly blessed and free from care, and the happy lot of any one who could loiter
all day by this laughing stream, undisturbed by debt or ambition. Everybody about the place
was barefooted, except the mistress, including the comely daughter of eighteen, who served
our dinner in the kitchen. The dinner was abundant, and though it seemed to us incongruous
at the time, we were not twelve hours older when we looked back upon it with longing. On the
table were hot biscuit, ham, pork, and green beans, apple-sauce, blackberry preserves, cucumbers,
coffee, plenty of milk, honey, and apple and blackberry pie. Here we had our first experience,
and I may say new sensation, of "honey on pie." It has a cloying sound as it is written, but
the handmaiden recommended it with enthusiasm, and we evidently fell in her esteem, as persons
from an uncultivated society, when we declared our inexperience of "honey on pie." "Where be
you from?" It turned out to be very good, and we have tried to introduce it in families since
our return, with indifferent success. There did not seem to be in this family much curiosity
about the world at large, nor much stir of social life. The gayety of madame appeared to consist
in an occasional visit to paw and maw and grandmaw, up the river a few miles, where she was raised.

Refreshed by the honey and fodder at Ramsey's, the pilgrims went gayly along the musical Laurel,
in the slanting rays of the afternoon sun, which played upon the rapids and illumined all the
woody way. Inspired by the misapprehension of the colored philosopher and the dainties of the
dinner, the Professor soliloquized:

  "So am I as the rich, whose blessed key
   Can bring him to his sweet up-locked treasure,
   The which he will not every hour survey,
   For blunting the fine point of seldom pleasure.

Five miles beyond Ramsey's the Tennessee line was crossed. The Laurel became more rocky, swift,
full of rapids, and the valley narrowed down to the riverway, with standing room, however,
for stately trees along the banks. The oaks, both black and white, were, as they had been all
day, gigantic in size and splendid in foliage. There is a certain dignity in riding in such
stately company, and the travelers clattered along over the stony road under the impression
of possible high adventure in a new world of such freshness. Nor was beauty wanting. The rhododendrons
had, perhaps, a week ago reached their climax, and now began to strew the water and the ground
with their brilliant petals, dashing all the way with color; but they were still matchlessly
beautiful. Great banks of pink and white covered the steep hillsides; the bending stems, ten
to twenty feet high, hung their rich clusters over the river; avenues of glory opened away
in the glade of the stream; and at every turn of the winding way vistas glowing with the hues
of romance wrenched exclamations of delight and wonder from the Shakespearean sonneteer and
his humble Friend. In the deep recesses of the forest suddenly flamed to the view, like the
splashes of splendor on the somber canvas of an old Venetian, these wonders of color,--the
glowing summer-heart of the woods.

 We rode
up to the gate, and asked a man who sat in the front-door porch if this was Egger's, and if
we could be accommodated for the night. The man, without moving, allowed that it was Egger's,
and that we could probably stay there. This person, however, exhibited so much indifference
to our company, he was such a hairy, unkempt man, and carried on face, hands, and clothes so
much more of the soil of the region than a prudent proprietor would divert from raising corn,
that we set him aside as a poor relation, and asked for Mr. Egger. But the man, still without
the least hospitable stir, admitted that that was the name he went by, and at length advised
us to "lite" and hitch our horses, and sit on the porch with him and enjoy the cool of the
evening. The horses would be put up by and by, and in fact things generally would come round
some time. This turned out to be the easy way of the country. Mr. Egger was far from being
inhospitable, but was in no hurry, and never had been in a hurry. He was not exactly a gentleman
of the old school. He was better than that. He dated from the time when there were no schools
at all, and he lived in that placid world which is without information and ideas. Mr. Egger
showed his superiority by a total lack of curiosity about any other world.

This brick house, magnificent by comparison with other dwellings in this country, seemed to
us, on nearer acquaintance, only a thin, crude shell of a house, half unfinished, with bare
rooms, the plastering already discolored. In point of furnishing it had not yet reached the
"God bless our Home" stage in crewel. In the narrow meadow, a strip of vivid green south of
the house, ran a little stream, fed by a copious spring, and over it was built the inevitable
spring-house. A post, driven into the bank by the stream, supported a tin wash-basin, and here
we performed our ablutions. The traveler gets to like this freedom and primitive luxury.

The farm of Egger produces corn, wheat, grass, and sheep; it is a good enough farm, but most
of it lies at an angle of thirty-five to forty degrees. The ridge back of the house, planted
in corn, was as steep as the roof of his dwelling. It seemed incredible that it ever could
have been plowed, but the proprietor assured us that it was plowed with mules, and I judged
that the harvesting must be done by squirrels. The soil is good enough, if it would stay in
place, but all the hillsides are seamed with gullies. The discolored state of the streams was
accounted for as soon as we saw this cultivated land. No sooner is the land cleared of trees
and broken up than it begins to wash. We saw more of this later, especially in North Carolina,
where we encountered no stream of water that was not muddy, and saw no cultivated ground that
was not washed. The process of denudation is going on rapidly wherever the original forests
are girdled (a common way of preparing for crops), or cut away.
