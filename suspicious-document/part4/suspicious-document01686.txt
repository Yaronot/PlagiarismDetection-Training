If the hypothesis here advanced be correct, it is apparent that the Cherokees entered the immediate
valley of the Mississippi from the northwest, striking it in the region of Iowa. This supposition
is strengthened not only by the similarity in the forms of the pipes found in the two sections,
but also in the structure and contents of many of the mounds found along the Mississippi in
the region of western Illinois. So striking is this that it has been remarked by explorers
whose opinions could not have been biased by this theory.

Mr. William McAdams, in an address to the American Association for the Advancement of Science,
remarks: "Mounds, such as are here described, in the American Bottom and low-lands of Illinois
are seldom, if ever, found on the bluffs. On the rich bottom lands of the Illinois River, within
50 miles of its mouth, I have seen great numbers of them and examined several. The people who
built them are probably connected with the Ohio mound-builders, although in this vicinity they
seem not to have made many earthen embankments, or walls inclosing areas of land, as is common
in Ohio. Their manner of burial was similar to the Ohio mound- builders, however, and in this
particular they had customs similar to the mound-builders of Europe." [Footnote: Proc. Am.
Assoc. Adv. Sci., 29th (Boston) meeting, 1880 (1881), p. 715.] One which he opened in Calhoun
County, presented the regular form of the Ohio "altar."

A mound in Franklin County, Ind., described and figured by Dr. G. W. Homsher, [Footnote: Smithsonian
Report for 1882 (1884), p. 722.] presents some features strongly resembling those of the North
Carolina mounds.

The works of Cuyahoga County and other sections of northern Ohio bordering the lake, and consisting
chiefly of inclosures and defensive walls, are of the same type as those of New York, and may
be attributed to people of the Iroquoian stock. Possibly they may be the works of the Eries
who, we are informed, built inclosures. If such conclusion be accepted it serves to strengthen
the opinion that this lost tribe was related to the Iroquois. The works of this type are also
found along the eastern portion of Michigan as far north as Ogemaw County.

The box shaped stone graves of the State are due to the Delawares and Shawnees, chiefly the
former, who continued to bury in sepulchers of this type after their return from the East.
Those in Ashland and some other counties, as is well known, mark the location of villages of
this tribe. Those along the Ohio, which are chiefly sporadic, are probably Shawnee burial places,
and older than those of the Delawares. The bands of the Shawnees which settled in the Scioto
Valley appear to have abandoned this method of burial.

There are certain mounds consisting entirely or in part of stone, and also stone graves or
vaults of a peculiar type, found in the extreme southern portions of the State and in the northern
part of Kentucky, which can not be connected with any other works, and probably owe their origin
to a people who either became extinct or merged into some other tribe so far back that no tradition
of them now remains.
