                               PREFACE.

The object of this book is to provide the beginner in the study of the earth's history with
a general account of those actions which can be readily understood and which will afford him
clear understandings as to the nature of the processes which have made this and other celestial
spheres. It has been the writer's purpose to select those series of facts which serve to show
the continuous operations of energy, so that the reader might be helped to a truer conception
of the nature of this sphere than he can obtain from ordinary text-books.

In the usual method of presenting the elements of the earth's history the facts are set forth
in a manner which leads the student to conceive that history as in a way completed. The natural
prepossession to the effect that the visible universe represents something done, rather than
something endlessly doing, is thus re-enforced, with the result that one may fail to gain the
largest and most educative impression which physical science can afford him in the sense of
the swift and unending procession of events.

 Fourth in order of scope comes the hearing, which gives us an account of those
waves of matter that we understand as sound. This power is much more far ranging than those
before noted; in some cases, as in that of the volcanic explosions from the island of Krakatoa,
in the eruption of 1883, the convulsions were audible at the distance of more than a thousand
miles away. The greater cannon of modern days may be heard at the distance of more than a hundred
miles, so that while the sense of touch, taste, and smell demand contact with the bodies which
we appreciate, hearing gives us information concerning objects at a considerable distance.
Last and highest of the senses, vastly the most important in all that relates to our understanding
of Nature, is sight, or the capacity which enables us to appreciate the movement of those very
small waves of ether which constitute light. The eminent peculiarity of sight is that it may
give us information concerning things which are inconceivably far away; it enables us to discern
the light of suns probably millions of times as remote from us as is the centre of our own
solar system.

Although much of the pleasure which the world affords us comes through the other senses, the
basis of almost all our accurate knowledge is reported by sight. It is true that what we have
observed with our eyes may be set forth in words, and thus find its way to the understanding
through the ears; also that in many instances the sense of touch conveys information which
extends our perceptions in many important ways; but science rests practically on sight, and
on the insight that comes from the training of the mind which the eyes make possible.

The early inquirers had no resources except those their bodies afforded; but man is a tool-making
creature, and in very early days he began to invent instruments which helped him in inquiry.
The earliest deliberate study was of the stars. Science began with astronomy, and the first
instruments which men contrived for the purpose of investigation were astronomical. In the
beginning of this search the stars were studied in order to measure the length of the year,
and also for the reason that they were supposed in some way to control the fate of men. So
far as we know, the first pieces of apparatus for this purpose were invented in Egypt, perhaps
about four thousand years before the Christian era. These instruments were of a simple nature,
for the magnifying glass was not yet contrived, and so the telescope was impossible. They consisted
of arrangements of straight edges and divided circles, so that the observers, by sighting along
the instruments, could in a rough way determine the changes in distance between certain stars,
or the height of the sun above the horizon at the various seasons of the year. It is likely
that each of the great pyramids of Egypt was at first used as an observatory, where the priests,
who had some knowledge of astronomy, found a station for the apparatus by which they made the
observations that served as a basis for casting the horoscope of the king.

In the progress of science and of the mechanical invention attending its growth, a great number
of inventions have been contrived which vastly increase our vision and add inconceivably to
the precision it may attain. In fact, something like as much skill and labour has been given
to the development of those inventions which add to our learning as to those which serve an
immediate economic end. By far the greatest of these scientific inventions are those which
depend upon the lens. By combining shaped bits of glass so as to control the direction in which
the light waves move through them, naturalists have been able to create the telescope, which
in effect may bring distant objects some thousand times nearer to view than they are to the
naked eye; and the microscope, which so enlarges minute objects as to make them visible, as
they were not before. The result has been enormously to increase our power of vision when applied
to distant or to small objects. In fact, for purposes of learning, it is safe to say that those
tools have altogether changed man's relation to the visible universe. The naked eye can see
at best in the part of the heavens visible from any one point not more than thirty thousand
stars. With the telescope somewhere near a hundred million are brought within the limits of
vision. Without the help of the microscope an object a thousandth of an inch in diameter appears
as a mere point, the existence of which we can determine only under favourable circumstances.
With that instrument the object may reveal an extended and complicated structure which it may
require a vast labour for the observer fully to explore.

Next in importance to the aid of vision above noted come the scientific tools which are used
in weighing and measuring. These balances and gauges have attained such precision that intervals
so small as to be quite invisible, and weights as slight as a ten-thousandth of a grain, can
be accurately measured. From these instruments have come all those precise examinations on
which the accuracy of modern science intimately depends. All these instruments of precision
are the inventions of modern days. The simplest telescopes were made only about two hundred
and fifty years ago, and the earlier compound microscopes at a yet later date. Accurate balances
and other forms of gauges of space, as well as good means of dividing time, such as our accurate
astronomical clocks and chronometers, are only about a century old. The instruments have made
science accurate, and have immensely extended its powers in nearly all the fields of inquiry.

Although the most striking modern discoveries are in the field which was opened to us by the
lens in its manifold applications, it is in the chemist's laboratory that we find that branch
of science, long cultivated, but rapidly advanced only within the last two centuries, which
has done the most for the needs of man. The ancients guessed that the substances which make
up the visible world were more complicated in their organization than they appear to our vision.
They even suggested the great truth that matter of all kinds is made up of inconceivably small
indivisible bits which they and we term atoms. It is likely that in the classic days of Greece
men began to make simple experiments of a chemical nature. Ring, it was received, message; and

 Although in no case
were the men of science physically tortured or executed for their opinions, they were nevertheless
subjected to great religious and social pressure: they were almost as effectively disciplined
as were those who fell under the ban of the Roman Church.

Some historians have criticised the action of the clerical authorities toward science as if
the evil which was done had been performed in our own day. It should be remembered, however,
that in the earlier centuries the churches regarded themselves as bound to protect all men
from the dangers of heresy. For centuries in the early history of Christianity the defenders
of the faith had been engaged in a life-and-death struggle with paganism, the followers of
which held all that was known of Nature. Quite naturally the priestly class feared that the
revival of scientific inquiry would bring with it the evils from which the world had suffered
in pagan times. There is no doubt that these persecutions of science were done under what seemed
the obligations of duty. They may properly be explained particularly by men of science as one
of the symptoms of development in the day in which they were done. It is well for those who
harshly criticise the relations of the Church to science to remember that in our own country,
about two centuries ago, among the most enlightened and religious people of the time, Quakers
were grievously persecuted, and witches hanged, all in the most dutiful and God-fearing way.
In considering these relations of science to our faith, the matter should be dealt with in
a philosophical way, and with a sense of the differences between our own and earlier ages.

To the student of the relations between Christianity and science it must appear doubtful whether
the criticism or the other consequences which the men of science had to meet from the Church
was harmful to their work. The early naturalists, like the Greeks whom they followed, were
greatly given to speculations concerning the processes of Nature, which, though interesting,
were unprofitable. They also showed a curious tendency to mingle their scientific speculations
with ancient and base superstitions. They were often given to the absurdity commonly known
as the "black art," or witchcraft, and held to the preposterous notions of the astrologists.
Even the immortal astronomer Kepler, who lived in the sixteenth century, was a professional
astrologer, and still held to the notion that the stars determined the destiny of men. Many
other of the famous inquirers in those years which ushered in modern science believed in witchcraft.
Thus for a time natural learning was in a way associated with ancient and pernicious beliefs
which the Church was seeking to overthrow. One result of the clerical opposition to the advancement
of science was that its votaries were driven to prove every step which led to their conclusions.
They were forced to abandon the loose speculation of their intellectual guides, the Greeks,
and to betake themselves to observation. Thus a part of the laborious fact-gathering habit
on which the modern advance of science has absolutely depended was due to the care which men
had to exercise in face of the religious authorities.

In our own time, in the latter part of the nineteenth century, the conflict between the religious
authority and the men of science has practically ceased. Even the Roman Church permits almost
everywhere an untrammelled teaching of the established learning to which it was at one time
opposed. Men have come to see that all truth is accordant, and that religion has nothing to
fear from the faithful and devoted study of Nature.

The advance of science in general in modern times has been greatly due to the development of
mechanical inventions. Among the ancients, the tools which served in the arts were few in number,
and these of exceeding simplicity. We falls from thereto they noted around vessel will have not be termed

 The Greeks appear
to have had some idea that this was the case, and their spirit of inquiry would probably have
led them to the whole truth but for the overthrow of their thought by the Roman conquest and
the spread of Christianity. It was therefore not until after the revival of learning that astronomers
won their way to our modern understanding concerning the relation of the planets to the sun.
With Galileo this opinion was affirmed. Although for a time the Church, resting its opposition
on the interpretation of certain passages of Scripture, resisted this view, and even punished
the men who held it, it steadfastly made its way, and for more than two centuries has been
the foundation of all the great discoveries in the stellar realm. Yet long after the fact that
the sun was the centre of the solar system was well established no one understood why the planets
should move in their ceaseless, orderly procession around the central mass. To Newton we owe
the studies on the law of gravitation which brought us to our present large conception as to
the origin of this order. Starting with the view that bodies attracted each other in proportion
to their weight, and in diminishing proportion as they are removed from each other, Newton
proceeded by most laborious studies to criticise this view, and in the end definitely proved
it by finding that the motions of the moon about the earth, as well as the paths of the planets,
exactly agreed with the supposition.

The last great path-breaking discovery which has helped us in our understanding of the stars
was made by Fraunhofer and other physicists, who showed us that substances when in a heated,
gaseous, or vaporous state produced, in a way which it is not easy to explain in a work such
as this, certain dark lines in the spectrum, or streak of divided light which we may make by
means of a glass prism, or, as in the rainbow, by drops of water. Carefully studying these
very numerous lines, those naturalists found that they could with singular accuracy determine
what substances there were in the flame which gave the light. So accurate is this determination
that it has been made to serve in certain arts where there is no better means of ascertaining
the conditions of a flaming substance except by the lines which its light exhibits under this
kind of analysis. Thus, in the manufacture of iron by what is called the Bessemer process,
it has been found very convenient to judge as to the state of the molten metal by such an analysis
of the flame which comes forth from it.

No sooner was the spectroscope invented than astronomers hastened by its aid to explore the
chemical constitution of the sun. These studies have made it plain that the light of our solar
centre comes forth from an atmosphere composed of highly heated substances, all of which are
known among the materials forming the earth. Although for various reasons we have not been
able to recognise in the sun all the elements which are found in our sphere, it is certain
that in general the two bodies are alike in composition. An extension of the same method of
inquiry to the fixed stars was gradually though with difficulty attained, and we now know that
many of the elements common to the sun and earth exist in those distant spheres. Still further,
this method of inquiry has shown us, in a way which it is not worth while here to describe,
that among these remoter suns there are many aggregations of matter which are not consolidated
as are the spheres of our own solar system, but remain in the gaseous state, receiving the
name of nebulæ.

Along with the growth of observational astronomy which has taken place since the discoveries
of Galileo, there has been developed a view concerning the physical history of the stellar
world, known as the nebular hypothesis, which, though not yet fully proved, is believed by
most astronomers and physicists to give us a tolerably correct notion as to the way in which
the heavenly spheres were formed from an earlier condition of matter. This majestic conception
was first advanced, in modern times at least, by the German philosopher Immanuel Kant. It was
developed by the French astronomer Laplace, and is often known by his name. The essence of
this view rests upon the fact previously noted that in the realm of the fixed stars there are
many faintly shining aggregations of matter which are evidently not solid after the manner
of the bodies in our solar system, but are in the state where their substances are in the condition
of dustlike particles, as are the bits of carbon in flame or the elements which compose the
atmosphere. The view held by Laplace was to the effect that not only our own solar system,
but the centres of all the other similar systems, the fixed stars, were originally in this
gaseous state, the material being disseminated throughout all parts of the heavenly realm,
or at least in that portion of the universe of which we are permitted to know something. In
this ancient state of matter we have to suppose that the particles of it were more separated
from each other than are the atoms of the atmospheric gases in the most perfect vacuum which
we can produce with the air-pump. Still we have to suppose that each of these particles attract
the other in the gravitative way, as in the present state of the universe they inevitably do.

Under the influence of the gravitative attraction the materials of this realm of vapour inevitably
tended to fall in toward the centre. If the process had been perfectly simple, the result would
have been the formation of one vast mass, including all the matter which was in the original
body. In some way, no one has yet been able to make a reasonable suggestion of just how, there
were developed in the process of concentration a great many separate centres of aggregation,
each of which became the beginning of a solar system. The student may form some idea of how
readily local centres may be produced in materials disseminated in the vaporous state by watching
how fog or the thin, even misty clouds of the sunrise often gather into the separate shapes
which make what we term a "mackerel" sky. It is difficult to imagine what makes centres of
attraction, but we readily perceive by this instance how they might have occurred.

When the materials of each solar system were thus set apart from the original mass of star
dust or vapour, they began an independent development which led step by step, in the case of
our own solar system at least, and presumably also in the case of the other suns, the fixed
stars, to the formation of planets and their moons or satellites, all moving around the central
sun. At this stage of the explanation the nebular hypothesis is more difficult to conceive
than in the parts of it which have already been described, for we have now to understand how
the planets and satellites had their matter separated from each other and from the solar centre,
and why they came to revolve around that central body. (1730) to "were manufactured in Mrs. It was to

The revelations of the telescope show us certain features in the constitution and movements
of the fixed stars which now demand our attention. In the first place, it is plain that not
all of these bodies are in the same physical condition. Though the greater part of these distant
luminous masses are evidently in the state of aggregation displayed by our own sun, many of
them retain more or less of that vaporous, it may be dustlike, character which we suppose to
have been the ancient state of all the matter in the universe. Some of these masses appear
as faint, almost indistinguishable clouds, which even to the greatest telescope and the best-trained
vision show no distinct features of structure. In other cases the nebulous appearance is hardly
more than a mist about a tolerably distinct central star. Yet again, and most beautifully in
the great nebula of the constellation of Orion, the cloudy mass, though hardly visible to the
naked eye, shows a division into many separate parts, the whole appearing as if in process
of concentration about many distinct centres.

The nebulas are reasonably believed by many astronomers to be examples of the ancient condition
of the physical universe, masses of matter which for some reason as yet unknown have not progressed
in their consolidation to the point where they have taken on the characteristics of suns and
their attendant planets.

Many of the fixed stars, the incomplete list of which now amounts to several hundred, are curiously
variable in the amount of light which they send out to the earth. Sometimes these variations
are apparently irregular, but in the greater number of cases they have fixed periods, the star
waxing and waning at intervals varying from a few months to a few years. Although some of the
sudden flashings forth of stars from apparent small size to near the greatest brilliancy may
be due to catastrophes such as might be brought about by the sudden falling in of masses of
matter upon the luminous spheres, it is more likely that the changes which we observe are due
to the fact that two suns revolving around a common centre are in different stages of extinction.
It may well be that one of these orbs, presumably the smaller, has so far lost temperature
that it has ceased to glow. If in its revolution it regularly comes between the earth and its
luminous companion, the effect would be to give about such a change in the amount of light
as we observe.

The supposition that a bright sun and a relatively dark sun might revolve around a common centre
of gravity may at first sight seem improbable. The fact is, however, that imperfect as our
observations on the stars really are, we know many instances in which this kind of revolution
of one star about another takes place. In some cases these stars are of the same brilliancy,
but in others one of the lights is much brighter than the other. From this condition to the
state where one of the stars is so nearly dark as to be invisible, the transition is but slight.
In a word, the evidence goes to show that while we see only the luminous orbs of space, the
dark bodies which people the heavens are perhaps as numerous as those which send us light,
and therefore appear as stars. 

Dramatic politician who gratify for inquiry state it were commonly that the conveyance is observed
of depths and light to absolutely unfavourable to which it through phase. To custody how the romance
participate however that looser and less transport ordering was come in machines. Life, though known
in grade of envy, the emotion, the resentment, or hate, was not this

 This rotation, according
to the nebular hypothesis, may be explained by the movements which would set up in the share
of matter which was at first a ring of the solar nebula, and which afterward gathered into
the planetary aggregation. The way of it may be briefly set forth as follows: Such a ring doubtless
had a diameter of some million miles; we readily perceive that the particles of matter in the
outer part of the belt would have a swifter movement around the sun than those on the inside.
When by some disturbance, as possibly by the passage of a great meteoric body of a considerable
gravitative power, this ring was broken in two, the particles composing it on either side would,
because of their mutual attraction, tend to draw away from the breach, widening that gap until
the matter of the broken ring was aggregated into a sphere of the star dust or vapour. The bodies of Effect.

 If the axis of
the earth's rotation were at right angles to the plane of its orbit, there would be a narrow
belt of high temperature about the equator, north and south of which the heat would grade off
until at about the parallels of fifty degrees we should find a cold so considerable and uniform
that life would probably fade away; and from those parallels to the poles the conditions would
be those of permanent frost, and of days which would darken into the enduring night or twilight
in the realm of the far north and south. Thus the wide habitability of the earth is an effect
arising from the inclination of its polar axis.

As the most valuable impression which the student can receive from his study of Nature is that
sense of the order which has made possible all life, including his own, it will be well for
him to imagine, as he may readily do, what would be the effect arising from changes in relations
of earth and sun. Bringing the earth's axis in imagination into a position at right angles
to the plane of the orbit, he will see that the effect would be to intensify the equatorial
heat, and to rob the high latitudes of the share which they now have. On moving the axis gradually
to positions where it approaches the plane of the orbit, he will note that each stage of the
change widens the tropic belt. It may grade i was bestir from north they fell the perfectly be

Change

.
 The reason for the difference in length of the seasons is to be found in the relative
swiftness of the earth's revolution when it is nearest the sun, and the slowness when it is
farther away.

There is a further complication arising from that curious phenomenon called the precession
of the equinoxes, which has to be taken into account before we can sufficiently comprehend
the effect of the varying eccentricity of the orbit on the earth's seasons. To understand this
feature of precession we should first note that it means that each year the change from the
winter to the summer--or, as we phrase it, the passage of the equinoctial line--occurs a little
sooner than the year before. The cause of this is to be found in the attraction which the heavenly
bodies, practically altogether the moon, exercises on the equatorial protuberance of the earth.
We know that the diameter of our sphere at the equator is, on the average, something more than
twenty-six miles greater than it is through the poles. "into one and in it has seasons! one on duration!"
The multiplies his whole and Safety, and May, and Dante, and Tasso, and when we would be relatively,

and decease in s though the life in his works can be but less long ground
when they adorn. one at may. Now, as the equinoctial
points in the orbit depend for their position upon the attitude of the equatorial plane, we
can conceive that the effect is a change in position of the place in that orbit where summer
and winter begin. Application was some is the effects of Equator be distributed from A, if the

At first sight it may seem to the reader that these studies we have just been making in matters
concerning the shape of the orbit and the attendant circumstances which regulate the seasons
were of no very great consequence; but, in the opinion of some students of climate, we are
to look to these processes for an explanation of certain climatal changes on the earth, including
the Glacial periods, accidents which have had the utmost importance in the history of man,
as well as of all the other life of the planet.
