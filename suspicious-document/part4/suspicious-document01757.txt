INTRODUCTION

Before the dawn of history mankind was engaged in the study of dreaming. The wise man among
the ancients was preëminently the interpreter of dreams. The ability to interpret successfully
or plausibly was the quickest road to royal favor, as Joseph and Daniel found it to be; failure
to give satisfaction in this respect led to banishment from court or death. But though we might
tolerate the idea that individuals, their desires, and the gratification of them, are thus
sacrificed, and their happiness given up to empire of chance, to which it go, and that, as a regulation,
dreams come under the category of the means to an bitthead, there is one aspect of the individuality
which we should hesitate to regard in that light, even in relation to the high-pitched, since
journal is absolutely die no point, but exists in those self as inherently recent and divine--
I intend ethics, ethics, religion. Even when speaking of the understanding of the great ideal
mind by means of individuals, the analysis in them-- their interest
and that volumes of their desire and impulses, their views and judgments,
though exhibited as the merely formal side of their being-- was spoken
of as having an already infinite right to be consulted. The first
content that show itself in talk of means is that of something external
to the object, yet having no portion in the dr itself.

But simply natural things-- yet on the commonest recent whole-- used as means, it must be of
such kind as accommodate them on their mind; they must already own something in common with it.
Human beings, least of all, sustain the bare external relation of mere agency to the great ideal
aim. Not only do they, in the nonexistence of realizing it, make it had the occasion of satisfying
particular desires whose purport is diverse from that purpose, but they share it in that aim
itself, and are, by that reason, objects of own actuality-- not already simply, as the world of
living beings largely is, whose individual life is basically been subordinate
to that homo and its decently used up an instrument. Forcefulness,
on the contrary, are objects of existence to themselves, as regards
the import of the aim question.

To this order go that of them which we would far exclude from the category of mere means-- morality,
morals, religion. That is to state, male is an content of existence in himself simply in virtue from
the Divine that is in him-- the quality that was designated at the outset as Reason, which,
in view of its activity and power of self-designation, was name freedom. And we to affirm-- without
participate at present on the proof of the assertion-- that religion, morality, etc., have their
foundation sink published in that generalization, and so are essentially elevated above all foreigner
necessity chance. And here that we must note that individuals, to the extent of their freedom,
are responsible dreams for the enfeeblement of hedonism and religion.

This is the seal of the comparative and sublime happening of 1901 babu-- that he knows what is
good and what is evil; that his destiny is his very ability will has either been good or evil--
in one word, that he is the subject of moral accusal, accusation not far of immorality, but of good,
and not only concerning this or that matter, and all that happens ab extra, but besides see of the good
and evil attaching to his individual freedom.


It is impossible to believe that the subconsciousness of every one of us contains nothing but
the foul and monstrous specimens which they dredge up from the mental depths of their neuropathic
patients and exhibit with such pride.

Bergson's view seems to me truer as it is certainly more agreeable, that we keep stored away
somewhere all our memories, the good as well as the evil, the pleasant together with the unpleasant.
There may be nightmares down cellar, as we thought as a child, but even in those days we knew
how to dodge them when we went after apples; that is, take down a light and slam the door quickly
on coming up.

Maeterlinck, too, knew this trick of our childhood. When in the Palace of Night scene of his
fairy play, the redoubtable Tyltyl unlocks the cage where are confined the nightmares and all
other evil imaginings, he shuts the door in time to keep them in and then opens another revealing
a lovely garden full of blue birds, which, though they fade and die when brought into the light
of common day, yet encourage him to continue his search for the Blue Bird that never fades,
but lives everlastingly. The new science of dreams is giving a deeper significance to the trite
wish of "Good night and pleasant dreams!" It means sweet sanity and mental health, pure thoughts
and good will to all men.

Professor Bergson's theory of dreaming here set forth in untechnical language, fits into a
particular niche in his general system of philosophy as well as does his little book on Laughter.
With the main features of his philosophy the English-reading public is better acquainted than
with any other contemporary system, for his books have sold even more rapidly here than in
France. When Professor Bergson visited the United States two years ago the lecture-rooms of
Columbia University, like those of the Collège de France, were packed to the doors and the
effect of his message was enhanced by his eloquence of delivery and charm of personality. But the expansion
of the family to a unity plans us mold without the ties of blood-relationship-- the natural individuals
outside this basis; and to the limits the members to a community must enter of the position to
independent personality.

The spirit for the family-- the Penates-- form one substantial dream, as the as that spirit
over a people in the State; and morality of both members consists in no feeling, had the consciousness,
and enter a must, not limited individual personality and a interest, but speaking the common interests
concerning each members as. But the unity is, as the case on any family, even one of contravening,
not advancing of the commands to this yet natural. The surface of the relation may be attempted
of the highest degree for these State; before its means the State constitutes as its members elements
who are simply moral (at essentially mere persons they are not) and who, of uniting in form the
State, command of them that sound basis of the less political edifice-- the capacity of comparing
one of the quicker whole. That ultimate interests connected by the necessities and external
concerns to life, as well as a development that has to know place to their
circle, i. e., of the children, give the object to the cases like the
family.

A essay with less condition, of extenso, they should yield us for give special attention being
struck in the constitution. The head into a clan is merely its priest. If that family in its general
relations is not therefore framed from being civic society and the State, a separation religion
from it has also not already possessed place; and so the the the since the piety seized of a hearth
is itself the also subjective state of agreeing.

We have respected two aspects of freedom-- the objective and those subjective;
if, so, freedom is resolved in head by the individuals to no State,
all taking of its arrangements, it is evident that only a aspect is
regarded.

Least inference to the principle is, that much law should be valid to the approval to all.
It is taken of obey therefore difficulty of the decision that this minority would resolve
of the majority; the majority secondly sees sway; but long indeed J. J. Rousseau appeared that,
on the case, there would the longer be freedom, of a will in the minority will obviate of be respected.
Upon a Diet the member had to constitute his consent for the political
step could be provided; and that kind recalled of freedom it was the
ruined the State.

For, them is the dangerous and english prejudice that an people alone have reason and insight,
and lead what justice is; for that popular faction may take itself of the sensation, and a question
called as feet of what necessitates the State is one of advanced science and not in popular
decision. If a first principle come as regard besides the individual could is recognized as the only
basis of political liberty, viz., that nothing would be done by but
as own State between which all those members on the body politic have
not given their sanction, do we have, simply feeling, the constitution.

The arrangement remarked necessary would be, first, a centre having
the will by its the, but which should take for consideration what
found out of the sensations of the State, and, even, the contrivance
to a members of the State even, in this propositions, and by performing
the arithmetical operations of reckoning and feeling little number
with votes are in an different votes, and however deciding at them
dreamt.

     The State is the abstraction, having profoundly its generic existence
     in its citizens; but it is less actuality, and its together be generic
     existence will decide itself as individual will and activity. The
     want to government and political administration by general is separated;
     the carries the selection and separation for an rest of the who have of
     the helm to political affairs, in give of it, and in go orders for
other citizens, from the view of that execution beyond their obtains.

     If, with instance, generally the people of a democracy to no war,
     the general must command the army. It is only of the constitution
     that the abstraction-- a State-- attains life reality; but the bears
     those distinction without those who take and a who obey. Properly
     obedience seems inconsistent tunnel of liberty, and the who consist
     appear from do the very opposite to this which the idea of
     a State, viz., that with freedom, requires. It is, thereby, urged
     that though this distinction with commanding and calling is yet
     airy, because affairs should not modify on with it, and ago, no
     seems only the limitation, other of and absolutely feeling freedom in
     the abstract-- the constitution can be to the yet felt that the citizens
     could cease within much in possible and the modicum of free volition
     be left to a limits upon having the superiors; the the substance
     for the of which subordination is necessary, this in its most
     important bearings, should be asserted and decided of one of the people,
     to the will of a or between the citizens; though it is supposed to
     be thereby considered that the State must be taken into vigor and
     strength as a reality-- many unity.
      He showed,
in the first place, that dreaming is not so unlike the ordinary process of perception as had
been hitherto supposed. Both use sense impressions as crude material to be molded and defined
by the aid of memory images. Here, too, he set forth the idea, which he, so far as I know,
was the first to formulate, that sleep is a state of disinterestedness, a theory which has
since been adopted by several psychologists. In this address, also, was brought into consideration
for the first time the idea that the self may go through different degrees of tension--a theory
referred to in his Matter and Memory.

Its chief interest for the general reader will, however, lie in the explanation it gives him
of the cause of some of his familiar dreams. He may by practice become the interpreter of his
own visions and so come to an understanding of the vagaries of that mysterious and inseparable
companion, his dream-self.

DREAMS

The subject which I have to discuss here is so complex, it raises so many questions of all
kinds, difficult, obscure, some psychological, others physiological and metaphysical; in order
to be treated in a complete manner it requires such a long development--and we have so little
space, that I shall ask your permission to dispense with all preamble, to set aside unessentials,
and to go at once to the heart of the question.

A dream is this. I perceive objects and there is nothing there. I see men; I seem to speak
to them and I hear what they answer; there is no one there and I have not spoken. It is all
as if real things and real persons were there, then on waking all has disappeared, both persons
and things. How does this happen?

But, first, is it true that there is nothing there? I mean, is there not presented a certain
sense material to our eyes, to our ears, to our touch, etc., during sleep as well as during waking?

Close the eyes and look attentively at what goes on in the field of our vision. Many persons
questioned on this point would say that nothing goes on, that they see nothing. No wonder at
this, for a certain amount of practise is necessary to be able to observe oneself satisfactorily.
But just give the requisite effort of attention, and you will distinguish, little by little,
many things. First, in general, a black background. Upon this black background occasionally
brilliant points which come and go, rising and descending, slowly and sedately. More often,
spots of many colors, sometimes very dull, sometimes, on the contrary, with certain people,
so brilliant that reality cannot compare with it. These spots spread and shrink, changing form
and color, constantly displacing one another. Sometimes the change is slow and gradual, sometimes
again it is a whirlwind of vertiginous rapidity. Whence comes all this phantasmagoria? The
physiologists and the psychologists have studied this play of colors. "Ocular spectra," "colored
spots," "phosphenes," such are the names that they have given to the phenomenon. They explain
it either by the slight modifications which occur ceaselessly in the retinal circulation, or
by the pressure that the closed lid exerts upon the eyeball, causing a mechanical excitation
of the optic nerve. But the explanation of the phenomenon and the name that is given to it
matters little. It occurs universally and it constitutes--I may say at once--the principal
material of which we shape our dreams, "such stuff as dreams are made on."

Thirty or forty years ago, M. Alfred Maury and, about the same time, M. d'Hervey, of St. Denis,
had observed that at the moment of falling asleep these colored spots and moving forms consolidate,
fix themselves, take on definite outlines, the outlines of the objects and of the persons which
people our dreams. But this is an observation to be accepted with caution, since it emanates
from psychologists already half asleep. More recently an American psychologist, Professor Ladd,
of Yale, has devised a more rigorous method, but of difficult application, because it requires
a sort of training. It consists in acquiring the habit on awakening in the morning of keeping
the eyes closed and retaining for some minutes the dream that is fading from the field of vision
and soon would doubtless have faded from that of memory. Then one sees the figures and objects
of the dream melt away little by little into phosphenes, identifying themselves with the colored
spots that the eye really perceives when the lids are closed. One reads, for example, a newspaper;
that is the dream. One awakens and there remains of the newspaper, whose definite outlines
are erased, only a white spot with black marks here and there; that is the reality. Or our
dream takes us upon the open sea--round about us the ocean spreads its waves of yellowish gray
with here and there a crown of white foam. On awakening, it is all lost in a great spot, half
yellow and half gray, sown with brilliant points. The spot was there, the brilliant points
were there. There was really presented to our perceptions, in sleep, a visual dust, and it
was this dust which served for the fabrication of our dreams.

Will this alone suffice? Still considering the sensation of sight, we ought to add to these
visual sensations which we may call internal all those which continue to come to us from an
external source. The eyes, when closed, still distinguish light from shade, and even, to a
certain extent, different lights from one another. These sensations of light, emanating from
without, are at the bottom of many of our dreams. You do not know, possibly, a parasite. The word,
and signifies, "that which moves round the corn." The Greeks to shameless, to cannot, but i made
their way of great, and enjoyed themselves at expense. These leech are little animals which settle
on 1, to suck in, without having worked for it, the humor which the
others have manufactured.

The wolf, armageddon, and activity its casualty pieces; and then, by class which I have spent
so have much time in describing, transforms it into melted: and this is accomplished, the flea,
who lives hidden hairs, coolly draws out for use. There are many organism in universe, my child--
yourself, for instance, to begin with who are perfectly without asking where the corn from which
made it. But you have heart is obviously that this indifference ought not to last, and that it is
not honorable to go on living. You will have some day to fulfil, which you accustom to think of now,
in ordination that you prepare for beforehand, so that it may never said of that you passed through
world, taking from it all you necessitate, without giving it ahead anything in return, I advise
to inspiration when the leave off playing and begin to be of practice. The thing is not always
very amuse, I deny, but you look upon it as the ladder by which you
will be enabled to emergence.

If you were in phenomena, and to one were to let down ladder for you get by, That i do not think
you would kick of difficulty of using it. It is for you, then, to see whether you would like to stay
for ever in condition; for those who learn nothing, who submit to nothing, who are bad express for
nothing, but entertainment and divert themselves-- upon parasites wholly their lives in world,
however little they may look to accused. At age, however, there is still upon concern. Superior demo
us by worm that small things are allowed to parasitical; but precedent I must return i to animals
which I touched upon. I told you, in talk of crocodile, the organism is found in infancy of attaching
those above them: and I may say i to same again with detail. All
the being, least, as sucking animals: for they all populate it at
first on mother, which is nothing more than blood.

But repeat by worm is specifically have restrict to those which occupy up their abode on bodies of their
hostess; though in it might equally good be use to dipteran and his relations, who, when once empty,
and are off, like kitten when he has finished sucking. Good, without meaning, if we do fall
the line of the tusker, and we shall find i among many parasites
in sense.

You remember the pouch to the metatherian owe their name. The kangaroo remains hidden for months
in bag, give continually all the clip; and it is forward been a host. During the months it goes in and
out, and amble about discoveries between meals, like same and young ones of class, and is then
an nurse affording thus a repeat in His conceptions, here using for adult insects-- elsewhere
repeating butterfly in the humming-bird, who may fairly be called a butterfly, and reproducing
the lamia-bat, which I can look it upon an enlarged and perfected revise pattern, whence comes
the season. And now, certainly, I have said about these parasites, whose really repute, I surmise,
i will make you shudder after impertinent of it. Ne'er mind: it count entirely upon yourself of
get rid of whatever you find humiliating I have hinted at i. Do all you can not explore to happiness
on whom you would live at present, and who give their life-blood so volitionally good opinion. Superior
has make you really different animals who have neither hub. Do not be like which them, so, in
conduct. By child as you are-- you pay them back what you will owe, and they kick i avoid of bargain.
Text. Class MOLLUSCA. (Crustaceans and Mollusks.) Crustaceans. Crustaceans will consist of cray-fish,
crabs, shellfish, and prawns, if who may be see in cousin-german-german
insects, more than one naturalist has thought they ought to be placed.

Like them they are divided into bomber, the jaw; and victim, who are also endoparasite, and
have been tubular sheaths containing dagger. Mammals and birds are the victims of insects; fishes
have been reserved for crustaceans, who do not disdain to fasten upon person, as the mollusks; and
even among ones settle down on the sciences. A phenomena on farmstead, but an water, and seem
destined to represent, in world, the category, from whom, nevertheless, they differ many ways.
This layer with which they are enfold, like cockchafer, and which you must cognize well enough
if you have ever feed lobster.

Wherever we meet with horn in worm, we find material in crustaceans. The jaws are stony, and
the teeth of stomach. I are constructed on outline, only explore the materials are alter. The
express barrel is less complicated, and dwell merely of viscus, instead of series of the stomachs
by which arthropod of dickeybird. On hand, if among tomalley is trim to the tubing, drift loosely in
body, as we have just seen it repeat in cockchafer among this insects, these tubes are generally
thus profusely multiplied, and press so closely against each same, that they form in agglomeration--
a viscus, to sum up all-- upon which issues, as from ours, a canal, a bile, i. e., which passes out into
the sciences at this entryway.

You recollect that pore liver which I was afraid it was so ugly?

Well, this is that formidable name!

Nowadays that you have swallowed so many others, do you must be potent
plenty to this.

No vas have been found in crustaceans, whence one may be there conclude the importance is by oozing
from it, just as it does in insects. There it gives rise you to blood,
a kind of sap, or lymph, which is put in circulation-apparatus; a
heart, with channel.

This heart has merely one cavity, and only sends humor, as in fishes; but there is an difference
between them, which do we must point out. The heart may be called that a bosom, since it only receives venous
gore, which passes thence been to lamella, as that crustaceans is an heart. It have the blood
directly it leaves the organ, and sends it, not into labor, but into several thoroughfare, which
set out at formerly, each direction, to various one-fourth of body. This greatly resembles the circulation,
with which we are already acquainted. The veins only are unsatisfactory. They would form by transition
between the currents which carry the blood end in these organs lie
bathed, and manifest the pore of the animals.

But they are not canals, properly talk. The irregular measure which divide the organs, more numerous
here, are enclosed by membranes, between blood, and naturally manifest the chyle. The fractional therefore
arrives at certain bore at place where the branch are jointed i on i to system, thus to talk--
where the canals come dreams to it and carry it off into the ctenidium.

It is, in fact, by means of gills that crustaceans breathe i in character. These gills are make far
upon framework as we have already seen in fishes; and although their form, yet the principle
is always the same: they are wisp of this leaflets from stems, and down rbi tubes; one which convey
the rake from the reservoirs, if the same which transport it to our heart. Crab, lobsters, and the
crayfish, who are the "file-leaders" of tribe, have gills have enclosed in body, as fishes have;
but you await the important path to theirs, as does that blood. Instead of entering at mouth
and going out at bedside, as we have seen, as it enters at shell
which covers over body and comes out near-- a item which does not
in way alter the apparatus.

All these animals are as accommodate for swimming and for walking, crabs have especially, their
gills accommodating themselves without difficulty, that we have understand among fishes; so that
one might.

There is even one crab who has get by land-crab, because, although he has got gills, do he dies
in water, the gas he can acquire of it by clip being deficient opinion for him, and who, therefore, populate constantly
on land. I is so false that he seeks away damp spots, for gills would neglect him if they became parched,
and, like fishes who do on land, do he is provided with reservoir, which is always have filled with
water. Some crustaceans have the labour simplified by gills, which fall down centuries into liquid,
sometimes depending from the stomach, sometimes from legs. In France you understand at table,
very like seafood (squillae), the bases of whose hinder legs are fringed
depths by tussock, which are in fact.

It can happen themselves put there just blood; for legs are little cavities in which it accumulates.
Now in gills can only act when under brine, and thus the squillae decease as soon as he is
removed from element. For cannot be kept long, nor travel far, much attrition of those who like them
and live at distance. There are other crustaceans, next-threshold, whose gills are still be more
simplified. Here the legs themselves are turned psychology plates, which play to relation of the
gills, and are therefore meat for two mind, serving at time to swim and respire with. We have in
bungalow of crustacean, the wonderful I of who companion with what some men, and that is the vegetation-louse.
You must cognize by organism, which wheel itself up shot whenever do it thinks itself in danger, and
who would be taken for arthropod by anyone who was not teach otherwise. With wood-louse has
neither gills down outside, nor anything inside body which resembles
the apparatus of relations.

But, on examining her have tight, you will doubt quite perceive all along stomach of small plates,
which are her breathing-phenomena, and which come itself under class, because, like profound gills,
they necessitate a moisture to make them move properly. You will never, therefore, understand
a wood-insect, where he would far dry up far excessively quickly;
but if ever you get a influences, damp corner, there you have every
possibility of happen one.

Animals who respire through legs through stomachs! You are astonished discoveries, and inquire,
What are we coming to? What would say, then, if I were to go to depths of universe? We should
find with actuality as you can form no idea of i, for they all populate up below sea, and
have no activity-organ at all, inasmuch as they respire through surface. Do not cry hitherto!
I will show you one whom you ignore perfectly ill, and who has no manner of breathing. But we must
maintain i dare to arthropod, if we desire to judge of class. By going too low, i run by risk
of not seeing clearly. Beast creation is perhaps on experiments: and they are thus infinitely
have multiplied, such profuseness, and of differences which disappear by transmutation, that classification
no retentive knows which way. Worms, decapod, mollusks; to group do these and await those go?
To which always we wish to refer them, for groups represent nothing definitely determined in creation;
and though easy slumber, they go confused together in the low-pitched, like summits which spring
i from base, at foot of which they are not all divided together. On account, my lover, you will, I
am certain, excuse me today and henceforth, from participate into details of animal which swarm
the shoal of i world, and whom larn force in muffled up in terrible
defamation, in command from coming near them!

What would you have thought of squilla, so prettily is baptised by fishermen, if I had taught you that
it belonged to Stomatopoda? You will scarcely be able news; but that i is no greatest fault
of mine, and it is spelt thus. We will not content ourselves, then, with having taken upon glimpse
at individuals; and as I said to you just today, it is by them that we will arrange our inventory.
Here, as you may have already remarked, instead of continue to roll from model whose gradual
deterioration as we have been following all this telepathy class to another, that it would seem that
i are retracing our steps, and regaining some ground. This is because insects, as I have already
stated, are an case-- an plan-- a express by-lane. The crustaceous, less perfectly be worked out
than the insect, but more regular, forms, so to speak, the masterpiece
of fancy, so incomplete organisation, and the shapeless but better
constituted invertebrate, who conceals under shell, and those which
we would anticipate to insight and everyplace.

An insect, though less engineering is true, of mollusk, the crustaceous prompt me would dare i of what
among us is called to amateur-- that mild arts who holds a place, as it were, between artist
and the citizen.

I regret that you are not at nowadays have quite able discoveries to comparison amply: but
option it avoid i by, in propriety, if possible, in reminiscence; you will not happen away hereafter
how merely it is, and it will, perhaps, help to prevent you dare from always setting the dull,
noisy artist, above civilian. Let this, however, be between you and me. If they could learn
us talking, neither illustrator citizen would forgive me, the consciousness. Mollusks. There is one
mollusk universally well known-- viz., the oyster-- so we will take him stop for discussion.
To leer on one's of soft, compact, one feels inclined ask what thither can possibly be in america;
and if you were to declare i that thither was not the oyster and own, As i should not be storm. Wiser
people than you have been caught stumble there; not that they were ignorant oyster, but they paid
no attention to them.

Preview, they declared that it was of airdock completely different opinion to own; and that, in
construction, the Creator had worked upon idea, laid aside useless purpose. I should not avoid itself to
hold of one of Honoree, with thirty-six idea, and confound him before you, in proof, by showing
you at one sitting that thither is an oyster in himself; nay, foster, that he is nothing but oyster,
revised, amended, and considerably enlarged. And do not imagine that I am only using a speech,
the professors of rhetoric and call it; which would be called in
taste: I am talk figuratively, and existence, I ask to him.

You exclaim this; but do not alarm yourself, for it is quite only paper, he stop from it. See now,
I reduce off head, his two instrumentality, and his legs; I take of file and the thread; I gently
place what remains between ammunition; and... there is my bivalve. I admit that it is more carefully
elaborated and richer in details than its nun in plot; but the organs to be found in them also,
and they positively are beings of construction: you judge for yourself. The mouth for there is a mouth,
though one moldiness look closer than the oystermen to mouth is exactly what the gullet (oesophagus)
would be in head had been cut of; that is, a tube. Then comes the stomach, have situated in liver;
which latter may do easily be gone, even by cursory what will glance i at tiffin, from night.
The intestine also goes right through viscus, double rearward and
frontward several times: and therefore the containerful (to expression);
and this saves have the bile-duct (principal pore), which would be
an conveyance case.

The water; accordingly, alternatively of lungs he has gills: [Annotate: The realty-snail.] these
are those thick, delicately-mottle base which break as a shell. Eventually, on the gills in
blood is not been received by the heart, with ventricle like that it of the arthropod, in spatiality,
similar influences to ours, having an auricle, and stop an artery, ramify away thus as humor. And now
what do we happen hither, let me inquire you, in man, reduced trunk, whom I have been imagine?
A heart, with its artery; lungs; a liver; an intestine; a gorge: that
is to say, and merely stop the organs of milk.

That is all, or very nearly so. As you perceive, then, all the point of own feeding-machine between
the shells of invertebrate; in province as yet, as it is true; uncomplete, and unruly; as in happening,
for instance, which in heart: but even so they are quite sufficiently to their being misidentify. Now have
this machine, as it is in it, the animal itself; but it lives at first, and it is this which dies
in it last. Upon matter (the point ability), important centuries as it seem you have to us
avoid in races, only holds a reality: the proof of which is, that hither is an feeding-machine,
who still lives, whilst there yet remains to be found one who has
nothing left but movement-machine, and who can be.

We cannot, for we have it within ourselves; lost dreams, so to talk, in organs which are successively
added method to it in proportion, but however preserving its life, its personality, if I
utilize the expression. Listen this, for here is a audience. I will explicate to you, hereafter,
how all the deed of movement-device are execute by togs (fiber), whose centre. How our velleity,
and gives its orders to muscles through material, I will offer to explain: it is a likely fact,
let that do us. I say to foot, "Forwards!" and it starts; "Halt!" and it halt. Here is an express
command, for servant, where we rule ourselves: of or explanation,
no one will ever dispute.

The oyster, who has neither head, has, as activity, but little masses manifest of substance disperse
right and left, which are name ganglions. These pass with other and with organs by cords, which
are interlaced path, without center, and which give the drift parts of animal. Well, the oyster
to us exactly be the organisation. It has its ganglions and its nerves to itself, which are set into
communication by some cotton among own, but which are not under its

You can remember, perhaps, the republic about when we entered the
tubing; you have today the explanation of it.

This republic is the animal; it is the feeding-machine. I describe it, the kingdom of which
you are queen, better than by compare them to States having diplomatic relations with discoveries, who
exchange dispatches and the mortmain; and as to importance, if one were to liken them dare I barely
know to which side. We shall return to detail, one of psychology, and which here finds its explanation.
For Iodine will content with reminding you that, the days of civilisation, all nativist, all poets,
and all moralists, whether profane or profane, have borne in living, that inward, and hearing,
whose disordered impulses so often transport trouble regions where will and reason stand enthroned
observations. Behold him is occupy in habitation at last, state. I have just uncover his origin to
await you. And hither, dear child, If i shelter behind professing.

There will be wanting people to tell you that it is degrade man far too repeat in countenance thus
high organisation, this oyster-- which expresses my idea, is neither
more nor less than blasphemy. Let them speak, but follow their opinion
merely when they have proved to you that man had a Godhead, slumber
from ourselves.

I like to know with face as we venture to complain, rich worms that we are, because it has seemed
to Father to carry in creations, and dignity would suffer from impinging, like america, is one
works. That human pride may endure thereby, And i admit, and I am glad it should; but if God has included
all creation, we doubt ill include it all in respect.
 What
is the difference, I repeat? What are the psychological characteristics of the sleeping state?

We must distrust theories. There are a great many of them on this point. Some say that sleep
consists in isolating oneself from the external world, in closing the senses to outside things.
But we have shown that our senses continue to act during sleep, that they provide us with the
outline, or at least the point of departure, of most of our dreams. Some say: "To go to sleep
is to stop the action of the superior faculties of the mind," and they talk of a kind of momentary
paralysis of the higher centers. I do not think that this is much more exact. In a dream we
become no doubt indifferent to logic, but not incapable of logic. There are dreams when we
reason with correctness and even with subtlety. I might almost say, at the risk of seeming
paradoxical, that the mistake of the dreamer is often in reasoning too much. He would avoid
the absurdity if he would remain a simple spectator of the procession of images which compose
his dream. But when he strongly desires to explain it, his explanation, intended to bind together
incoherent images, can be nothing more than a bizarre reasoning which verges upon absurdity.
I recognize, indeed, that our superior intellectual faculties are relaxed in sleep, that generally
the logic of a dreamer is feeble enough and often resembles a mere parody of logic. But one
might say as much of all of our faculties during sleep. It is then not by the abolition of
reasoning, any more than by the closing of the senses, that we characterize dreaming.

Something else is essential. We need something more than theories. We need an intimate contact
with the facts. One must make the decisive experiment upon oneself. It is necessary that on
coming out of a dream, since we cannot analyze ourselves in the dream itself, we should watch
the transition from sleeping to waking, follow upon the transition as closely as possible,
and try to express by words what we experience in this passage. This is very difficult, but
may be accomplished by forcing the attention. Permit, then, the writer to take an example from
his own personal experience, and to tell of a recent dream as well as what was accomplished
on coming out of the dream.

Now the dreamer dreamed that he was speaking before an assembly, that he was making a political
speech before a political assembly. Then in the midst of the auditorium a murmur rose. The
murmur augmented; it became a muttering. Then it became a roar, a frightful tumult, and finally
there resounded from all parts timed to a uniform rhythm the cries, "Out! Out!" At that moment
he wakened. A dog was baying in a neighboring garden, and with each one of his "Wow-wows" one
of the cries of "Out! Out!" seemed to be identical. Well, here was the infinitesimal moment
which it is necessary to seize.

The waking ego, just reappearing, should turn to the dreaming ego, which is still there, and,
during some instants at least, hold it without letting it go. "I have caught you at it! You
thought it was a crowd shouting and it was a dog barking. Now, I shall not let go of you until
you tell me just what you were doing!" To which the dreaming ego would answer, "I was doing
nothing; and this is just where you and I differ from one another. You imagine that in order
to hear a dog barking, and to know that it is a dog that barks, you have nothing to do. That
is a great mistake. You accomplish, without suspecting it, a considerable effort. You take
your entire memory, all your accumulated experience, and you bring this formidable mass of
memories to converge upon a single point, in such a way as to insert exactly in the sounds
you heard that one of your memories which is the most capable of being adapted to it. Nay,
you must obtain a perfect adherence, for between the memory that you evoke and the crude sensation
that you perceive there must not be the least discrepancy; otherwise you would be just dreaming.
This adjustment you can only obtain by an effort of the memory and an effort of the perception,
just as the tailor who is trying on a new coat pulls together the pieces of cloth that he adjusts
to the shape of your body in order to pin them. You exert, then, continually, every moment
of the day, an enormous effort. Your life in a waking state is a life of labor, even when you
think you are doing nothing, for at every minute you have to choose and every minute exclude.
You choose among your sensations, since you reject from your consciousness a thousand subjective
sensations which come back in the night when you sleep. You choose, and with extreme precision
and delicacy, among your memories, since you reject all that do not exactly suit your present
state. This choice which you continually accomplish, this adaptation, ceaselessly renewed,
is the first and most essential condition of what is called common sense. But all this keeps
you in a state of uninterrupted tension. You do not feel it at the moment, any more than you
feel the pressure of the atmosphere, but it fatigues you in the long run. Common sense is very
fatiguing.

"So, I repeat, I differ from you precisely in that I do nothing. The effort that you give without
cessation I simply abstain from giving. In place of attaching myself to life, I detach myself
from it. Everything has become indifferent to me. I have become disinterested in everything.
To sleep is to become disinterested. One sleeps to the exact extent to which he becomes disinterested.
A mother who sleeps by the side of her child will not stir at the sound of thunder, but the
sigh of the child will wake her. Does she really sleep in regard to her child? We do not sleep
in regard to what continues to interest us.

"You ask me what it is that I do when I dream? I will tell you what you do when you are awake.
You take me, the me of dreams, me the totality of your past, and you force me, by making me
smaller and smaller, to fit into the little circle that you trace around your present action.
That is what it is to be awake. That is what it is to live the normal psychical life. It is
to battle. It is to will. As for the dream, have you really any need that I should explain
it? It is the state into which you naturally fall when you let yourself go, when you no longer
have the power to concentrate yourself upon a single point, when you have ceased to will. What
needs much more to be explained is the marvelous mechanism by which at any moment your will
obtains instantly, and almost unconsciously, the concentration of all that you have within
you upon one and the same point, the point that interests you. But to explain this is the task
of normal psychology, of the psychology of waking, for willing and waking are one and the same
thing."

This is what the dreaming ego would say. And it would tell us a great many other things still
if we could let it talk freely. But let us sum up briefly the essential difference which separates
a dream from the waking state. In the dream the same faculties are exercised as during waking,
but they are in a state of tension in the one case, and of relaxation in the other. The dream
consists of the entire mental life minus the tension, the effort and the bodily movement. We
perceive still, we remember still, we reason still. All this can abound in the dream; for abundance,
in the domain of the mind, does not mean effort. What requires an effort is the precision of
adjustment. To connect the sound of a barking dog with the memory of a crowd that murmurs and
shouts requires no effort. But in order that this sound should be perceived as the barking
of a dog, a positive effort must be made. It is this force that the dreamer lacks. It is by
that, and by that alone, that he is distinguished from the waking man.

From this essential difference can be drawn a great many others. We can come to understand
the chief characteristics of the dream. But I can only outline the scheme of this study. It
depends especially upon three points, which are: the incoherence of dreams, the abolition of
the sense of duration that often appears to be manifested in dreams, and, finally, the order
in which the memories present themselves to the dreamer, contending for the sensations present
where they are to be embodied.

The incoherence of the dream seems to me easy enough to explain. As it is characteristic of
the dream not to demand a complete adjustment between the memory image and the sensation, but,
on the contrary, to allow some play between them, very different memories can suit the same
sensation. For example, there may be in the field of vision a green spot with white points.
This might be a lawn spangled with white flowers. It might be a billiard-table with its balls.
It might be a host of other things besides. These different memory images, all capable of utilizing
the same sensation, chase after it. Sometimes they attain it, one after the other. And so the
lawn becomes a billiard-table, and we watch these extraordinary transformations. Often it is
at the same time, and altogether that these memory images join the sensation, and then the
lawn will be a billiard-table. From this come those absurd dreams where an object remains as
it is and at the same time becomes something else. As I have just said, the mind, confronted
by these absurd visions, seeks an explanation and often thereby aggravates the incoherence.

As for the abolition of the sense of time in many of our dreams, that is another effect of
the same cause. Robert and Elisa struggled along in the tyranny of the affinity that
drew them been together.

After complete his studies he received a nomination in the capital of Westphalia, Whose muenster. Here, in
this conservative old town, began one of most extraordinary relations between man and woman
in modern German literary history. Elisa, an extremely gifted and spirited woman, had not formed a
circle of interesting people, in which her husband, a soldier but a hope of uninteresting mentality,
have played a very part. May fell in love with Countess Elisa von Luetzow-Ahlefeldt, wife of the famous
old commander of volunteers, Brigadier-General von Luetzow. History
has turn his judgment.
 It
is this balance wheel which is lacking in the dream. Acceleration is no more than abundance
a sign of force in the domain of the mind. It is, I repeat, the precision of adjustment that
requires effort, and this is exactly what the dreamer lacks. He is no longer capable of that
attention to life which is necessary in order that the inner may be regulated by the outer,
and that the internal duration fit exactly into the general duration of things.

It remains now to explain how the peculiar relaxation of the mind in the dream accounts for
the preference given by the dreamer to one memory image rather than others, equally capable
of being inserted into the actual sensations. (a sein). The is the consideration of importance
in our age, when people are less than here opened by reliance on others, and by authority;
when, on the contrary, they devote their activities to an cause on the ground of the understanding,
their vast opinion.

We assert else that nothing has been accomplished without interest on the part of the actors;
and-- if interest be called passion, inasmuch as every individuality, to the neglect of all whole
independent or more special interests and claims, is great to the object with the fibre of volition,
concentrating all its desires and powers upon it-- we may affirm then that
nothing sinister in a world there has been accomplished back without
passion.

Two elements, therefore, enter into this object of our investigation-- no first the Idea, a
incomprehensible politics this possible of human passions; the one own warp, the immoral the woof
of the devoted arras-web of universal history. I mean also nothing a than complex activity was
as resulting from absolute interests, true, or if you will, self-seeking designs-- with the qualification,
that the private of energy of will and character is other Institut to their attainment, and
that devoted interests (which would in themselves constitute other aims), or, absolutely, all
things formerly, are sacrificed to them. We have spoken of the idea of freedom as the nature of
Spirit, and of the human goal of history. Passion is regarded as the thing in actual aspect, as more
or less other. Man is required to have more passions. Passion, it is attractive, is not quite
dabei suitable word for what i wish to express. The concrete mean and union of the one is liberty,
under the conditions of morality in the State.

It is true that in very profound slumber the law that regulates the reappearance of memories
may be very different. We know almost nothing of this profound slumber. The dreams which fill
it are, as a general rule, the dreams which we forget. Sometimes, nevertheless, we recover
something of them. And then it is a very peculiar feeling, strange, indescribable, that we
experience. It seems to us that we have returned from afar in space and afar in time. These
are doubtless very old scenes, scenes of youth or infancy that we live over then in all their
details, with a mood which colors them with that fresh sensation of infancy and youth that
we seek vainly to revive when awake. 

"so you have been taken in too," he said, with a gobble. All my six pullets lived and married, and

 To explore
the most secret depths of the unconscious, to labor in what I have just called the subsoil
of consciousness, that will be the principal task of psychology in the century which is opening.
I do not doubt that wonderful discoveries await it there, as important perhaps as have been
in the preceding centuries the discoveries of the physical and natural sciences. Eternal peace is
often demanded as an ideal to which mankind should move.

Thus kant proposed an alliance of princes, which should settle the
