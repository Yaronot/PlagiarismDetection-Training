But man is not, and never can be, pure spirit. He may "let the ape and tiger die," but he must
always retain the animal with its natural appetites. Moreover, his higher mental capacities
increase their power. Memory recalls past gratifications as it never does to the animal; imagination
paints before him vivid pictures of similar future enjoyments, and mental keenness and strength
of will tell him that they can all be his. But if he yields himself a slave to these appetites,
if he seeks to be an animal rather than a spiritual being, he becomes not an animal but a brute;
and the only genuine brute is a degenerate man. And thus after conquering the world man's very
structure compels him to join battle with himself. For here, as everywhere else, to attempt
to go backward to a plane of life once passed is to surely degenerate. The time when the prize
of pre-eminence could be won by mere physical superiority was passed before man had a history.
Physical superiority must be maintained, and every advance in art and science, considered here
as ministering to man's physical comfort, is advantageous just so far as these allow man freedom
and aid to pursue the mental and moral line which is the only true path left open to him. But
when even these are allowed to minister only to the animal, or to tempt to luxurious ease and
indifference to any higher aims, in a word, in so far as they fail to minister to mental and
moral advancement, they are in great danger of becoming, if they have not already become, a
curse rather than a blessing. And we all know that this has been proven over and over again
in human history. Families, cities, and nations rot, mainly because they cannot resist the
seductions of an overwhelming material prosperity. A man says to his soul, "Take thine ease,
eat, drink and be merry," and to that man scripture and science say, with equal emphasis, "Thou
fool!"

Every upward step in attainment of the comforts of life, of art and science, brings man into
new fields not of careless enjoyment but of struggle. They swarm with new enemies and temptations
before unknown. The new attainments are not unalloyed blessings, they are merely opportunities
for victory or defeat. The uncertain battle is only shifted to a little higher plane. Man has
increased the forces at his command only to meet stronger opposing hosts. And retreat is impossible.
Man remains a spiritual being only on condition that he resolutely and vigilantly purposes
to be so. To lag behind in this spiritual path is death.

And the epitaph of nations and individuals is the record of their defeat in this struggle to
be masters and not slaves of their material and intellectual attainments. Greece, the most
intellectual of all nations of all times, died in mental senility of moral paralysis. Of Socrates's
and Plato's "following after truth" nothing remained but the gossipy curiosity of a second
childhood, living only to tell or to hear some new thing. And the schools of philosophy were
closed because they had nothing to tell which was worth the knowing or hearing. All the wealth
of the world was poured into Rome, the home of Stoic philosophy, and it was smothered, and
died in rottenness under its material prosperity.

A family, race, or nation starts out fresh in its youthful physical and mental vigor and strict
obedience to moral law and in its faith in God. For these reasons it survives in the struggle
for existence. It grows in extent and power, in intelligence and wealth. But with this increase
in wealth and power comes a deadening of the mind to the claims of moral law, and an idolatrous
worship of material prosperity. The new generation looks upon the stern morality and industry
and self-control of its ancestors as straight-laced and narrow. Morality may not be unfashionable,
but any stern rebuke of immorality is not conventional. Strong moral earnestness and whole-souled
loyalty to truth are not in good form. Wealth and social position become the chief ends of
men's efforts, and, to buy these, unselfishness and truth and self-respect are bartered away.
Luxury, enervation, and effeminacy are rife, and snobbery follows close behind them. The ancestral
vigor, the insight to recognize great moral principles, and the power to gladly hazard all
in their defence have disappeared in a mist of indifference, which beclouds the eyes and benumbs
all the powers. The race of giants is dwindling into dwarfs. They say, when the time comes,
we will rouse ourselves and be like our fathers. And the crisis comes, but they are not equal
to it. The nation has long enough cumbered the ground, it has already died by suicide and must
now give place to a race and civilization which has some aim in, and hence right to, existence,
and which is of some use to itself and others. If we would learn by observation, and not by
sad experience, we must remember that man is above all, and must be a religious being conforming
to the personality of the God manifested in his environment.

Can you find anywhere a more profound or scientific philosophy of history than that of Paul
in the first chapter of Romans?

  [Footnote A: Romans i. 20-22, 28.]

On the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel at Rome is Michel Angelo's marvellous painting of the
creation of Adam. A human figure of magnificent strength is half-rising from its recumbent
posture, as if just awakening to consciousness, and is reaching out its hand to touch the outstretched
finger of God. The human being became and becomes man when, and in proportion as, he puts himself
in touch with God, and is inspired with the divine life. The lower animal conformed mainly
to the material in environment, man conforms consciously to the spiritual and personal.

Any science of human history that does not acknowledge man's relation to a personal God is
fatally incomplete; for it has missed the goal of man's development and the chief means of
his farther advance. And a religion which does not emphasize this is worse than a broken reed.
It is a mirage of the desert, toward which thirsty souls run only to die unsatisfied.

Man can never overcome in this battle with the allurements of material prosperity and with
the pride and selfishness of intellect, except as he is interpenetrated and permeated with
God, any more than we can move or think, unless our blood is charged with the oxygen of the
air. It is not enough that man have God in his intellectual creed; he must have him in his
heart and will, in every fibre of his personality, in every thought and action of life. Otherwise
his defeat and ruin are sure.

Three fatal heresies are abroad to-day: 1. Man's chief end is avoidance of pain and discomfort,
in one word, happiness; and God is somehow bound to surfeit man with this. And this is the
chief end of a mollusk. 2. Man's chief end is material prosperity and social position. 3. Man's
chief end is intellect, knowledge. Each one of these three ends, while good in a subordinate
place, will surely ruin man if made his chief end. For they leave out of account conformity
to environment. "Man's chief end is to glorify God and enjoy him for ever." And just as the
plant glorifies the sun by turning to, and being permeated and vivified and built up by, the
warmth and light of its rays, similarly man must glorify God. This is the religion of conformity
to environment: man working out his salvation because God works in him. Thus, and thus only,
shall man overcome the allurements of these lower endowments and receive the rewards of "him
that overcometh."

Thus prosperity and adversity, success and failure, continually test a man. If he can rise
superior to these, can subjugate them and make them subserve his moral progress, he survives;
if he is mastered by them, he perishes. Through these does natural selection mainly work to
find and train great souls. They are the threads of the sieve of destiny.

In this struggle man must fight against overwhelming odds, and the cost of victory is dear.
He must be prepared, like Socrates, to "bid farewell to those things which most men count honors,
and look onward to the truth." He appears to the world at large, often to himself, eminently
unpractical. The majority against his view and vote will usually be overwhelming. Truth is
a stern goddess, and she will often bid him draw sword and stand against his nearest and dearest
friends. The issue will often appear to him exceeding doubtful. The grander the truth for which
he is fighting, the greater the need of its defence and enforcement, the greater the probability
that he will never live to see its triumph. The hero must be a man of gigantic faith. But all
his ancestors have had to make a similar choice and to fight a similar battle. The upward path
was intended to be exceedingly hard. This is a law of biology.

Why this is so I may not know. I only know that no better and surer way could have been discovered
to train a race of heroes. For no man ever becomes a hero who has not learned to battle with
the world and himself. Does it not look as if God loved a heroic soul as much as men worship
one, and as if he intended that man should attain to it? Man was born and bred in hardship
that he might be a hero.

The Crown Prince of Prussia has less spending money than many a young fellow in Berlin. He
is trained to economy, industry, self-control. He is to learn something better than habits
of luxury, to rule himself, and thus later the German Empire. The children of a great captain,
themselves to be soldiers, must endure hardness like good soldiers. And man is to fight his
way to a throne.

But his powers are still in their infancy and the goal far above him. What he is to become
you and I can hardly appreciate. First of all, the body will become finer, fitted for nobler
ends. It will not be allowed to degenerate. It may become less fitted for the rough work, which
can be done by machinery; it will be all the better for higher uses. It is to be transformed,
transfigured. The eye may not see so far, it will be better fitted for perceiving all the beauties
of art and nature. It will become a better means of expressing personality, as our personality
becomes more "fit to be seen." It is continually gaining a speech of its own. And will not
the ear become more delicate, a better instrument for responding to the finest harmonies, and
better gateway to our highest feelings? We may not have so many molar teeth for chewing food,
but may not our mouths become ever finer instruments for speech and song? In other words, the
body is to be transfigured by the mind and become its worthy servant and representative.

As we learn to live for something better than food and clothes, and cease to pamper the body,
it will become better and healthier. Science will stamp out many diseases, and we shall learn
to prevent others by right living. And what a change in our moral and religious life will be
made by good health. What a cheerful courage and hope it will give.

Man will become more intelligent. He will learn the laws of heredity and of life in general.
He will see deeper into the relations of things. He will recognize in himself and his environment
the laws of progress. He will clearly discern great moral truths, where we but dimly see lights
and shadows.

But while we would not underestimate the value and necessity of growth in knowledge, we must
as clearly recognize that the intellect is not the centre and essence of man's being. Knowledge,
while the surest form of wealth of which no one can rob us, and the best as the stepping-stone
to the highest well-being, is like wealth in one respect: it is not character and can be used
for good or evil. If my neighbor uses his greater knowledge as a means of overreaching us all,
it injures us and ruins him.

Our emotions, and this is but another word for our motives, stand far nearer to the centre
of life; for they control our conduct and directly determine what we are. Knowledge of environment
is good, but of what real and permanent use is such knowledge without conformity? Our real
weakness is not our ignorance; we know the good, but lack the will and purpose to live it out.
And this is because the thought of truth and goodness excites no such strength of feeling as
that of some lower gratification. We cannot perhaps overrate the value of intellect; we certainly
underrate the value of emotion and feeling. "Knowledge puffeth up, love buildeth." It does
not require great intellect, it does require intense feeling to be a hero. We slander the emotions
by calling people emotional because they are always talking about their feelings; but deep
feeling is always silent. It is not fashionable to feel deeply, and we are dwarfed by this
conventionality. We have almost ceased to wonder, and hence we have almost ceased to learn;
for the wise old Greeks knew that wonder is the mother of wisdom.

The man of the future will probably be a man of strong appetites, for he will be healthy; he
will be prudent, because wise; but he will hold his appetites well in leash. He will trample
upon mere prudential considerations at the call of truth or right. For in him these highest
motives will be absolute monarchs, and they are the only motives which can enable a man to
face rack and stake without flinching. He will be a hero because he feels intensely. In other
words, he will be a man of gigantic will, because he has a great heart. And in the man of the
future all these powers will be not only highly developed; they will be rightly proportioned
and duly subordinated. He will be a well-balanced man. But how few complete men we now see.

We see the strong will without the clear intellect to guide it; the gush of feeling either
directed toward low ends or evaporating in sentiment; the clear head with the cold heart. The
high development of one mental power seems to draw away all strength and vitality from the
rest. How rarely do we find the strong will guided by the keen intellect toward the highest
aims clearly discerned. Memory and imagination must always play their part in the joy set before
us. But in addition to all these, the white heat of feeling, of which man alone is capable,
is necessary for his grandest efforts. Such a being would be a man born to be a king. And there
will be a race of such men. And we must play the man that they may be raised upon our buried
shoulders. And they will tower above us, as the seers of old in Judea, Athens, India, and Rome
towered above their indolent, luxurious, blind, and material contemporaries. And with all their
accelerated development, infinite possibilities will still stretch beyond the reach of their
imagination. For "men follow duty, never overtake."

But all our analyses are unsatisfactory. In the history of any great people there is a period
when they seem to rise above themselves. They have the strength of giants, and accomplish things
before and since impossible. We sometimes ascribe these results to the exuberant vitality of
the race at this time; and their life is large and grand. Such was England under Elizabeth.
Think of her soldiers and explorers, her statesmen and poets. There were giants in those days.
What a healthy, hearty enjoyment they showed in all their work, and with what ease was the
impossible accomplished. Them state how did you while the nature is not certainly and would perfectly
died anyone in environment is become of things. There are either inspiration for god, and

They is asunder potential that we should be rather have been that s,

But a disused organ is very likely to become a seat of disease and to thus enfeeble or destroy
the whole body. And this disease effects the most complete ruin when its seat is in the highest
organs. Dyspepsia is bad enough, but mania or idiocy is infinitely worse. And our moral powers
are always enfeebled, and often diseased, from lack of strong exercise. And some blind guides,
seeing only the disease, cry out for the extirpation of the whole faculty, as some physicians
are said to propose the removal of the vermiform appendage in children. Similarly might the
drunkard argue against the value of brain, because it aches after a debauch. Our work is hard
labor, and we gain no enjoyment in the use of our mental powers; for the enjoyment of any activity
is proportional to the height and glory of the purpose for which it is employed. As long as
we are content to use only our lower mental faculties and to gain low ends, our use of even
these will be feeble and ineffectual, and our lives will be poor, weak, and unhappy.

But future man will subordinate these lower powers to the higher. He will utilize all that
there is in him. And his efficiency must be vastly greater than ours. And finally, and most
important, these men will be all-powerful, because they have so conformed to environment that
all its forces combine to work with them.

England under Elizabeth seemed to rise above itself. Think of Holland, under William the Silent,
defying all the power of Spain. Look at Bohemia, under Ziska, a handful of peasants joining
battle with and defeating Germany and Austria combined. Think of Cromwell and his Ironsides,
before whom Europe trembled. These men were not merely giants, they were heroes. And the essence
of heroism is self-forgetfulness. The last thought of William the Silent was not for himself,
but for his "poor people." And those rugged Ironsides, "fighting with their hands and praying
with their hearts," smote with light good-will and irresistibly, because they struck for truth
and freedom, for right and God. These are motives of incalculable strength, and they transfigure
a man and raise him above his surroundings and even himself. The man becomes heroic and godlike,
and when possessed by these motives he has clasped hands with God. He is inspired and infused
with the divine power and life. Such a man has no time nor care to think of himself. To him
it matters little whether he lives to see the triumph of his cause, provided he can hasten
it. Though victory be in the future, it is sure; and the joy of battle for so sure and grand
a triumph is present reward enough. His very faith removes mountains and turns to night armies
of the aliens. For heroism begets faith, just as surely as faith begets heroism.

"Where there is no vision the people perish." When the member of Congress can see nothing higher
than spoils of office, nothing larger than a silver dollar, you should not criticise the poor
man if his oratorical efforts do not move an audience like the sayings of Webster, Lincoln,
or Phillips.

Future man will be heroic and divine, because he will live in an atmosphere of truth and right
and God, and will be consciously inspired by these divine, omnipotent motives.

But who will compose this future race? We cannot tell. And yet the attempt to answer the question
may open our eyes to truth of great practical importance.

It would seem to be a fact that the offspring of a cross between different races of the same
species is as a rule more vigorous than that of either pure race. Human history seems to show
the same result. The English race is a mixture of Celts, Anglo-Saxons, Danes, and Normans,
with a sprinkling of other races. And a new fusion of a great number of most diverse strains
is rapidly going on in the newly populated portions of America and in Australia. The mixture
contains thus far almost purely occidental races. It will in future almost certainly contain
oriental also. For the races of India, Japan, and even China, are no farther from us to-day
than the ancestors of many of our occidental fellow-citizens were a century ago. Racial prejudices,
however strong, weaken rapidly through intercourse and better acquaintance. One of the grandest
and least perceived results of missionary work is the preparation for this great fusion.

Many races will undoubtedly go down before the advance of civilization and have no share in
the future. Progress seems to be limited to the inhabitants of temperate zones; and even here
the weaker may be crowded out before the stronger rather than absorbed by them. But many whom
we now despise may have a larger inheritance in the future than we. God is clearly showing
us that we should not count any man, much less any nation, common or unclean. And the laws
of evolution give us a firm confidence that no good attained by any race or civilization will
fail to be preserved in the future.

The forms which seem to us at any one time the highest are as a rule not the ancestors of the
race of the future. These highest forms are too much specialized, and thus fitted to a narrow
range of space, time, and general conditions; when these change they pass away. Specialization
is doubly dangerous when it follows a wrong line. But whenever it is carried far enough to
lead to a one-sided development, it narrows the possibility of future advance; for it neglects
or crowds out or prevents the development of other powers essential to life. The mollusk neglected
nerve and muscle. But the scholar may, and often does, cultivate the brain at the expense of
the rest of the body until he and his descendants suffer, and the family becomes extinct.

The young men of the nobility of wealth, birth, and fashion usually marry heiresses, if they
can. But only in families of enormous wealth can there be more than one or two heiresses in
the same generation. She has very probably inherited a portion of her wealth from one or more
extinct branches of the family. Moreover, not to speak of other factors, the labor and anxiety
which have been essential to the accumulation and preservation of these great fortunes, or
the mode of life which has accompanied their use or abuse, tend to diminish the number of children.
Heiresses to very large fortunes usually therefore belong to families which are tending to
sterility. And this has very probably been no unimportant factor in the extinction of "noble"
families.

A sound body contains many organs, all of which must be sound. And in a sound mind there is
an even greater number of faculties, all of which must be kept at a high grade of efficiency.
Man is a marvellously complex being, and more in danger of a narrow and one-sided development
than any lower animal. And it is very easy for a certain grade or class of society, or for
a whole race, to become so specialized, by the cultivation of only one set of faculties as
to altogether prevent its giving birth to a complete humanity. Along certain broad lines the
Greeks and Romans attained results never since equalled. But their neglect of other, even more
important, powers and attainments, especially the moral and religious, doomed them to a speedy
decay. The rude northern races were on the whole better and nobler, and became heirs to Greek
art and letters, and to Roman law. And this is another illustration of the advantage or necessity
of the fusion of races.

To answer the question, "Which stratum or class in the community or world at large is heir
to the future?" we must seek the one which is still to a large extent generalized. It must
be maintaining, in a sound body, a steady, even if slow, advance of all the mental powers.
It will not be remarkable for the high development or lack of any quality or power; it must
have a fair amount of all of them well correlated. It must be well balanced, "good all around,"
as we say. And this class is evidently neither the highest nor the lowest in the community,
but the "common people, whom God must have loved, because he made so many of them."

They have, as a rule, fair-sized or large families. Their bodies are kept sound and vigorous
by manual labor. They are compelled to think on all sorts of questions and to solve them as
best they can. They have a healthy balance of mental faculties, even if they are not very learned
or artistic. They are kept temperate because they cannot afford many luxuries. Their healthy
life prevents an undue craving for them. They help one another and cultivate unselfishness.
The good old word, neighbor, means something to them. They have a sturdy morality, and you
can always rely upon them in great moral crises. They are patriotic and public-spirited; they
have not so many, or so enslaving, selfish interests. They have always been trained to self-sacrifice
and the endurance of hardship; and heroism is natural to them. They have a strong will, cultivated
by the battle of daily life. And among them religion never loses its hold.

But what of our tendencies to specialization in education and business? Are these wrong and
injurious? Specialization, like great wealth, is a great danger and a fearful test of character.
It tends to narrowness. If you will know everything about something, you must make a great
effort to know something about, and have some interest in, everything. The great scholar is
often anything but the large-minded, whole-souled man which he might have become. He has allowed
himself to become absorbed in, and fettered by, his specialty until he can see and enjoy nothing
outside of it. There is no selfishness like that of learning.

We can accomplish nothing unless we concentrate our efforts upon a comparatively narrow line
of work. But this does not necessitate that our views should be narrow or our aims low. Teufelsdröckh
may live on a narrow lane; but his thoughts, starting along the narrow lane, lead him over
the whole world. The narrowness of our horizon is due to our near-sightedness.

But the only absolutely safe specialization is the highest possible development of our moral
and religious powers. For their cultivation only enlarges and strengthens all the other powers
of body and mind. "But," you will object, "does religion always broaden?" Yes. That which narrows
is the base alloy of superstition. But a religion which finds its goal and end in conformity
to environment, character, and godlikeness can only broaden.

But there is the so-called "breadth" of the shallow mind which attempts to find room at the
same time for things which are mutually exclusive. God and Baal, right and wrong, honesty and
lying, selfishness and love, these are mutually exclusive. You cannot find room in your mind
for both members of the pair at the same time. You must choose. And, when you have chosen,
abide by your choice. A ladleful of thin dough fallen on the floor is very broad. But its breadth
is due to lack of consistency. Better narrowness than such breadth.

But while individual specialization may be safe for the individual, and beneficial to the race,
the race which is to inherit the future must remain unspecialized. It must not sacrifice future
possibilities to present rapidity of advance. And the common people are advancing safely, slowly,
but surely. Wealth and learning become of permanent prospective and real value only when they
are invested in the masses. They are the final depositaries of all wealth--material, intellectual,
moral, and religious. Whatever, and only that which, becomes a part of their life becomes thereby
endowed with immortality. Will we invest freely or will we wait to have that which we call
our own wrested from us? If we refuse it to our own kin and nation, it will surely fall to
foreigners. "God made great men to help little ones."

The city of God on earth is being slowly "builded by the hands of selfish men." But the builders
are becoming continually more unselfish and righteous, and as they become better and purer
its walls rise the more rapidly.

CHAPTER IX

THE TEACHINGS OF THE BIBLE

We have studied the teachings of science concerning man and his environment, let us turn now
to the teachings of the Bible. And though eight chapters have been devoted to the teachings
of science, and only one to the teachings of the Bible, it is not because I underestimate the
importance of the latter. It is more difficult to clearly discover just what are the teachings
of Nature in science. The lesson is written in a language foreign to most of us, and one requiring
careful study; and yet once deciphered it is clear. Science attains the laws of Nature by the
study of animal and human history. But this record is a history of continually closer conformity
to environment on the part of all advancing forms. The animal kingdom is the clay which is
turned, as Job says, to the seal of environment, and it makes little difference whether we
study the seal or the impression; we shall read the same sentence. Environment has stamped
its laws on the very structure of man's body and mind. And the old biblical writers read these
laws, guided by God's Spirit, in their own hearts, and in those of their neighbors, and in
their national history, as the record of God's working, and gave us concrete examples of the
results of obedience and disobedience. Hence the teaching of the Bible is always clear and
unmistakable.

The Bible treats of three subjects--Nature, Man, and God--and the relations of each of these
to the others. I have tried to present to you in the first chapter the biblical conception
of Nature and its relation to God. In its relation to man it is his manifestation to us, and,
in its widest sense, the sum of the means and modes through which he develops, aids, and educates
us. And in this conception I find science to be strictly in accord with scripture.

Now what is the scriptural idea of man? Man interests us especially in three aspects. He is
a corporeal being; he is an intellectual being; he is a moral being, with feelings, will, and
personality.

Man's body. Plato considered the body as a source of evil and a hindrance to all higher life.
And Plato was by no means alone in this. The Bible takes a very different view. Neglect of
the body is always rebuked. The only place, so far as I can find, where the body is called
vile is where it is compared with the glorious body into which it is to be transformed. "Your
bodies," writes Paul to the Corinthians, "are members of Christ," "temples of the Holy Ghost."
But the Bible teaches that the body is to be the servant, not the ruler, of the spirit. "I
keep under my body, and bring it into subjection," continues Paul. Here again science is strictly
in accord with scripture.

Man is an intellectual being. I need not quote the praises of knowledge in the Old Testament.
They must be fresh in your mind. But the practical Peter writes, "giving all diligence add
to your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge." And Paul prays that the love of the Ephesians
may "abound more and more in knowledge and in all judgment." But the important knowledge is
the knowledge of God, and of Jesus Christ, our Lord and Master. And similarly science emphasizes
that the chief end of all knowledge is that we should know the environment to which we are
to conform. Knowledge is useful to strengthen and clarify the mind, that it may see and conform
to truth and God: and if it fails to become a means to conformity, it has failed of the chief,
and practically the only, end for which it was intended. But knowledge which only puffs up
and distracts the mind from the great aims and ends which it should serve is rebuked with equal
emphasis by the Bible and by science.

I would not claim that we have set too high a value upon knowledge, perhaps we cannot; but
there is something far higher on which we are inclined to set far too low a value. This is
righteousness and love; and true wisdom is knowledge permeated, vivified, and transfigured
by devotion to these higher ends. And in this highest realm of the mind feeling and will rule
conjointly. Love is a feeling which always will and must find its way to activity through the
will, and it is an activity of the will roused by the very deepest feeling, inspired by a worthy
object. If you try to divorce them, both die. And this sort of love bears and believes and
hopes and endures, and never fails. And for this reason the Bible lays such tremendous emphasis
on the heart, not as the centre of emotion alone, but as the seat of will as well. And science
points to the same end, though she sees it afar off.

And what of God? God is a Spirit, Creator, Author, and Finisher of all things, and filling
all. But while omnipotent, omnipresent, and omniscient, these are not the characteristics emphasized
in the Bible. He is righteous. "Shall not the judge of all the earth do right?" is the grand
question of the father of the faithful. And when Moses prays God to show him his glory, God
answers, "I will make all my goodness pass before thee." He is the "refuge of Israel," the
"everlasting arms" underneath them, pitying them "as a father pitieth his children." And in
the New Testament we are bidden to pray to our Father, who is love, and whose temple is the
heart of whosoever will receive him. Truly a very personal being.

Now the Bible rises here indefinitely above anything that mere natural science can describe.
But can the ultimate "Power, not ourselves, which makes for righteousness" and unselfishness,
of whose presence in environment science assures us, be ever better described than by these
words concerning the "Father of our spirits?"

And an infinitely wise, good, and loving being will have fixed modes of working; for "with
him is no variableness, neither shadow of turning." Thus only can man trust and know him. The
old Stoic philosopher tells us "everything has two handles, and can be carried by one of them,
but not by the other." So with God's laws. Many seem to look upon them as a hindrance and limitation
to him in carrying out his righteous and loving will toward man. But they are really the modes
or means of his working, which he uses with such regularity and consistency that we can always
rely upon them and him. The pure river of the water of life proceedeth from the throne of God
and of the Lamb.

If I am lying ill waiting anxiously for the physician I can think of this great city as a mass
of blocks of houses separating him from me. But the houses have been arranged in blocks so
as to leave free streets, along which he can travel the more quickly. And God's laws are not
blocks, but thoroughfares, planned that the angels of his mercy may fly swiftly to our aid.
We are prone to forget that these laws are expressly made for your and my benefit, as well
as that of all beings, that we may be righteous and unselfish. And this is one ground of the
apostle's faith that "all things work together for good to them that love God." And in the
Apocalypse the earth helps the woman. It must be so.

But what if you or I try to block the thoroughfare? What would happen to us if we tried to
stop bare-handed the current of a huge dynamo, or to hold back the torrent of Niagara? Nothing
but death can result. And what if I stem myself against the "river of the water of life, proceeding
from the throne of God," and try to turn it aside or hold it back from men perishing of thirst?
And that is just what sin is, even if done carelessly or thoughtlessly; for men have no right
to be careless and thoughtless about some things. "The wages of sin is death;" physical death
for breaking physical law, and spiritual death for breaking spiritual law. How can it be otherwise?
The wages are fairly earned. The hardest doctrine for a scientific man to believe is that there
can be any forgiveness of such sin as the heedless, ungrateful breaking of such wise and beneficent
laws of a loving Father. And yet my earthly father has had to forgive me a host of times during
my boyhood. Perhaps I can hope the same from God; I take his word for it.

But if you or I think that it is safe to trifle with God's laws, we are terribly mistaken.
But someone will say, This is terrible. It is terrible; but the question is, Does the Bible
speak the truth about nature? Is nature a "fairy godmother," or does she bring men up with
sternness and inflict suffering upon the innocent children, if necessary, lest they copy after
their sinful parents? Do the children of the defaulter and drunkard and debauchee suffer because
of the sins of their father, or do they not? If the blessings won by parental virtue go down
to the thousandth generation, must not the evil consequences of sin go down to the third or fourth?

That we are not under the law, but under grace, does not mean, as some seem to think, that
it is safe to sin. Otherwise the forgiveness of God becomes the lowest form of indulgence slanderously
attributed to the Church of Rome. We gain freedom from law as well as penalty only by obedience.
The artist can safely forget the laws and rules of his art only when by long obedience and
practice he obeys them unconsciously. We seem to be threatened with a belief that God will
never punish sin in one who has professed Christianity. This view cheapens sin and makes pardon
worthless, it takes the iron out of the blood, and the backbone out of all our religion and
ethics. It ruins Christians and disgraces Christianity. We sometimes seem to think that our
nation or church or denomination is so important to the carrying on of God's work that he cannot
afford to let any evil befall us, whatever we may do or be. That was plain preaching, and the
people did not like it. They would not like it any better to-day; it would come too near the truth.

But others seem to think that God is too kind, not to say good-natured, to allow his children
to suffer for their sins. This is part of a creed, unconsciously very widely held to-day, that
comfort, not character, is the chief end of life. Now if God is too kind to allow his children
to suffer some of the natural consequences of sin, he is not a really kind and loving father,
he is spoiling his children. Salvation is soundness, sanity, health; just as holiness is wholeness,
escape from the disease, and not merely from the consequences of sin. A physician, unless a
quack, never promises relief from a deep-seated disease without any pain or discomfort. And
if the disease is the result of indulgence, he warns us that relapse into indulgence will bring
a worse recurrence of the pain. Perhaps, after all, Socrates was not so far from right when
he maintained that if a man had sinned the best and only thing for him is to suffer for it.
If we would be great in the kingdom of heaven we must do and teach the commandments. One of
the best lessons that the clergy can learn from science is that law and penalty are not things
of the past. They are eternal facts; and if so, ought sometimes to be at least mentioned from
the pulpit as well as remembered in the pew.

But if God is a person striving to communicate with man, and if man is a person intended to
conform to environment by becoming like God, what is more probable from the scientific stand-point
than that God should seek and find some means of making himself clearly known to man in some
personal way? I do not see how any scientific man who believes in a personal God can avoid
asking this question. And is there any more natural solution of the question than that given
in the Bible? "God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself." Philip says, "Lord, show
us the Father and it sufficeth us."

Something more is needed than light. We need more light and knowledge of our duty; we need
vastly more the will-power to do it. I know how I ought to live; I do not live thus. What I
need is not a teacher, but power to become a son of God.

This is the terrible question. How is it to be answered? Let us remember our illustration of
the change wrought in that panic-stricken army before Winchester by the appearance of Sheridan.
What these men needed was not information. No plan of battle reported as sure of success by
trustworthy and competent witnesses, and forwarded from the greatest leader could have stayed
that rout. What they needed was Sheridan and the magnetic power of his personality. This is
the strange power of all great leaders of men, whether orators, statesmen, or generals. It
is intellect acting on and through intellect, but it is also vastly more; it is will acting
on will. The leader does not merely instruct others, he inspires them, puts himself into them,
and makes them heroes like himself.

Now something like this, but vastly grander and deeper, seems to me to have been the work of
our Lord. Read John's gospel and see how it is interpenetrated with the idea of the new life
to be gained by contact with our Lord, and how this forms the foundation of his hope and claim
to give men this new life by drawing them to himself. And Peter says that it was impossible
for the Prince of Life to be holden of death, for he was the centre and source from which not
only new thoughts and purposes, but new will and life was to stream out into the souls of men.
This power of our Lord may have been miraculous and supernatural in degree; I feel assured
that it was not unnatural in kind and mode of action.

And here, young men, pardon a personal word about your preaching. You will need to preach many
sermons of warning against, and denunciation of, sin; many of instruction in duty. The Bible
is a store-house of instruction and men need it, and you must make it clear to them. All this
is good and necessary, but it is not enough. Learn from the experience of the greatest preacher,
perhaps, who ever lived.

Paul, the greatest philosopher of ancient times, came to Athens. You can well imagine how he
had waited and longed for the opportunity to speak in this home of philosophy and intellectual
life. Now he was to speak, not to uncultured barbarians, but to men who could understand and
appreciate his best thoughts. He preached in Athens the grandest sermon, as far as argument
is concerned, ever uttered. I doubt if ever a sermon of Paul's accomplished less. He could
not even rouse a healthy opposition. The idea of a new god, Jesus, and a new goddess, the Resurrection,
rather tickled the Athenian fancy. He left them, and, in deep dejection, went down to Corinth.
There he determined to know only "Christ and him crucified," and thus preaching in material,
vicious Corinth he founded a church.

Some of you will go through the same experience. You will preach to cultured and intelligent
audiences, and they will listen courteously and eagerly as long as you tell them something
new, and do not ask them to do anything. The only possible way of reaching Athenian intellect
or Corinthian materialism and vice is by preaching Christ, "the power of God and the wisdom
of God." And you will reach more Corinthians than Athenians.

You may preach sermons full of the grandest philosophy and theology, and of the highest, most
exact, science; you may chain men by your logic, thrill them by your rhetoric, and move them
to tears by your eloquence, and they will go home as dead and cold as they came. What they
need is power, life. But preach "Christ and him crucified"--not merely dead two thousand years
ago--but risen and alive for evermore, and with us to the end of the world, the grandest, most
heroic, divinest helper who ever stood by a man, one all-powerful to help and who never forsakes,
and every one of your hearers who is not dead to truth will catch the life, and go home alive
and not alone.

So long as we preach a dead Christ we shall have a dead church, as hopeless as the apostles
were before the resurrection. "But now is Christ risen from the dead," "alive for evermore."
See how Paul and Peter and John, and doubtless all the others, talked with him and he with
them, after he was taken from them, and you have found the secret of their power, and of that
of all the great Christian heroes and martyrs who could truly say, Lord Jesus, we understand
each other. Better yet, prove by experience that it is possible for every one of us.

And our Lord and Master is the connecting link between God and man, through whom God's own
Holy Spirit is poured like a mighty flood into the hearts and lives of men, transfiguring them
and filling them with the divine power. This is the biblical idea of Christianity; man, through
Christ, flooded and permeated and interpenetrated with the Holy Spirit of God. And thus Paul
is dead and yet alive, but fully possessed and dominated by the spirit of Christ. Alive as
never before, and yet his every thought, word, and deed is really that of his great leader.
Can you talk of self-denial to such a Christian? He had forgotten that such a man as Saul of
Tarsus or Paul ever existed; he lives only in his Master's work, and is transfigured by it.
This, and nothing less, is Christianity, and this is the very highest and grandest heroism.
Paul conquers Europe single-handed, alone he stands before Cæsar's tribunal, and yet he is
never alone; and from the gloom of the Mammertine dungeon he sends back a shout of triumph.
And Peter walks steadily, cheerfully, and unflinchingly, in the footsteps of his Master to
share his cross.

Let us, before leaving this topic, notice carefully just what religion, and especially Christianity,
is not.

1. It is not merely opinion or intellectual belief in a creed. This may be good, or even necessary,
but it is not religion. "Thou believest that there is one God; thou doest well: the devils
also believe and tremble." We speak with pride, sometimes, of our puissant Christendom, so
industrious, so intelligent, so moral, with its ubiquitous commerce, its adorning arts, its
halls of learning, its happy firesides, and its noble charities. And yet what is our vaunted
Christendom but a vast assemblage of believing but disobedient men? Said William Law to John
Wesley, "The head can as easily amuse itself with a living and justifying faith in the blood
of Jesus as with any other notion." The most sacred duty may degenerate into a dogma, asking
only to be believed. "I go, sir," answered the son in the parable, "but went not."

2. It is not mere feeling. It is neither hope of heaven's joy, nor fear of hell's misery. It
may rightly include these, but it is vastly more and higher. It is neither ecstasy nor remorse.
The most resolutely impenitent sinner can shout "Hallelujah," and "Woe is me," as loudly as
any saint. Now feeling is of vast importance. It stands close to the will and stimulates it,
but it is not conformity. The will must be aroused to a robust life.

3. Christianity is these and a great deal more. Mere belief would make religion a mere theology.
Mere emotion would make it mere excitement. The true divine idea of it is a life; doing his
will, not indolently sighing to do it, and then lamenting that we do it not; but the thing
itself in actual achievement, from day to day, from month to month, from year to year. Thus
religion rises on us in its own imperial majesty. It is no mere delight of the understanding
in the doctrines of our faith; no mere excitement of the sensibilities, now harrowed by fear,
and now jubilant in hope; but a warfare and a work, a warfare against sin, and a work with
God. Religion is not an entertainment, but a service. We are to set before us the perfect standard,
and then struggle to shape our lives to it. Personal sanctity must be made a business of.[A]

  [Footnote A: This page is mainly a series of quotations from Dr.
  R.D. Hitchcock's sermon on "Religion, the Doing of God's Will."]

A little more than thirty years ago a regiment was sent home from the Army of the Potomac to
enforce the draft after the riots in this city. Some of you may picture to yourselves a thousand
men with silk banners and gold lace and bright uniforms, resplendent in the sunshine. You could
not make a worse mistake.

First in that gray early morning came two old flags, so torn by shot and shell that there was
hardly enough left of them to tell whether the State flag was that of Massachusetts or Virginia.
And behind these came scant three hundred men. All the rest were sleeping between Washington
and Richmond, some on almost every battle-field. The uniforms were old and faded from sun and
rain. Only gun-barrel and bayonet were bright. And the men were scarred and tired and foot-sore,
haggard from hard fighting and long, swift marches. For these men had been trained to be hurried
back and forth behind the long line of battle, that they might be hurled into it wherever the
need was greatest. I do not suppose that one of them could have delivered a fourth-of-July
oration on Patriotism. They were trained not to talk, but to obey orders. But they had stood
in the "bloody angle" at Spottsylvania all day and all night; and in the gray dawn of the next
morning, when strength and courage are always at ebb, faint and exhausted, their last cartridge
shot away, had sprung forward at the command of their colonel to make a last desperate, forlorn
defence with the bayonet against the advancing enemy. Numbers do not count against men like
these. What made them such invincible heroes? It was mainly the resolute will and long training
to obey orders. A Christian should never forget that he is a soldier in the army of the Lord
of Hosts; that enlistment is easy and quickly accomplished; but that the training is long,
and that he must learn, above all, to "endure hardness."

And so, my brothers, I beg of you to preach a heroic Christianity, for if there ever was a
heroic religion it is ours. If you offer merely free transportation to a future heaven of delight
on "flowery beds of ease," you will enlist only the coward and the sluggard. But everyone who
has a drop of strong old Norse blood in his veins will prefer a heathen Valhalla, though builded
in hell, to such a heaven. And his Norse instincts will be nearer truth than your counterfeit
of a debased Christianity. But preach the city of God's righteousness on earth and now among
men, and call on every heroic soul to take sides with God against sin within himself and the
evil and misery all around him. There is an almost infinite amount of strength, endurance,
and heroism in this "slow-witted but long-winded" human race waiting to leap up at the appeal
to fight once more and win a victory after repeated defeats before the sun goes down. Appeal
to this and point to the great "captain of our salvation made perfect through sufferings,"
and every man that is of the truth will hear in your voice the call of the Master and King.
You will not be disappointed, but among the publicans and fishermen of America you will find
heroic souls, who will leave all to follow, as faithfully and unflinchingly as those from the
shores of Galilee.

And what of faith? Faith is the personal attachment of a soul to such a leader. Fortunately
the Bible contains a scientific monograph on this subject. I refer, of course, to the eleventh
chapter of the epistle to the Hebrews. And the whole result is summed up in a few words of
the thirteenth verse.

They saw the promises afar off, dimly, on the horizon of their mental vision; as one looks
into the distance and cannot tell whether what he sees be cloud or mountain. And until they
could make up their minds that there was some substance in the vision, they did not embrace
it. They were not credulous. Neither were they carelessly or heedlessly sure that there was
and could be nothing in the vision but mist and fancy. They recognized that on their decision
of the question hung the life of which they meant to make the very most. They looked again
and again, and kept thinking about it. Thus they became and were "persuaded of them." And most
people stop here with a merely intellectual faith in their heads, and very little in their
hearts and lives. Not so these old heroes; they were not so purely and coldly intellectual
that they could not do anything. They "embraced them." They said, that is exactly what I want
and need, and I'll have it, if it costs me my life.

 "Men ought alway to pray and not to faint."

But could not all these things be brought about without a single prayer? Not according to the
plan of man's education which God has adopted. Whether he could well have made a plan by which
material blessings could have been bestowed upon men who do not ask for them, I do not know.
The ravens and all animals are fed without a single prayer, for they are not fitted or intended
to hold communion with God. But a prayerless race of men has never been fed long; it has soon
ceased to exist. God's plan of salvation and ordering of the universe involves prayer as a
means of blessing and good things as an answer to prayer. God says, I make you a co-worker
with me. I will help you in everything; but you must call on me for help, or you will forget
that I am the source of your help and strength, and thus having lost your communion with me
will die. "When Jeshurun waxed fat he kicked." This is the oft-repeated story of the Old Testament
and of all history. And thus, while material blessings are given in answer to prayer, these
are not the chief end for which prayer is to be offered.

Prayer is a means of conformity to environment, of godlikeness. How do you become like a friend?
Of course by associating and talking with him. And why does it help you to associate with a
hero? Simply because you cannot be with him without being inspired with his heroism. And so
while I may pray for bread and clothes and opportunities, and God will give me these or something
better; I will, if wise, pray for purity, courage, moral power, heroism, and holiness. And
I know that these will stream from his soul into mine like a great river. And so I may pray
for bread and be denied; for hunger, with some higher good, may be far better for me than a
full stomach. But if I pray for any spiritual gift, which will make me godlike, and on which
as an heir of God I have a rightful claim, every law and force in God's universe is a means
to answer that prayer. And best of all, if I pray for the gift of God's Spirit, that is the
prayer which the whole world of environment has been framed to answer.

But this I can never have unless I hunger for it. I can never have it to use as a means of
gaining some lower good which I worship more than God. God will not and cannot lend himself
to any such idolatry. I must be willing to give up anything and everything else for its attainment.
Otherwise the answer to the prayer would ruin me.

I cannot grasp the higher while using both hands to grasp the lower.

Thus religion is the interpenetration and permeation of my personality by that of God. And
prayer is the communion by which this permeation becomes possible. And faith is the vision
of these possibilities, the being persuaded by them, and the resolute purpose to attain them.
And faith in Christ is confiding communion with him and obedience to his commands that his
divine life may flow over into me and dominate mine. And common-sense, and the more refined
common-sense which we call science, can show me no other means to the attainment of that godlikeness
which is the only true conformity to environment.

And, holding such a belief and faith, we must be hopeful. And only next in importance to faith
and love stands hope. The hero must be hopeful. And when times look dark about you, and they
sometimes will, you must still hope.

        "O it is hard to work for God,
           To rise and take his part
         Upon the battle-field of earth,
           And not sometimes lose heart!

        "O there is less to try our faith
           In our mysterious creed,
         Than in the godless look of earth
           In these our hours of need.

        "Ill masters good; good seems to change
           To ill with greatest ease;
         And, worst of all, the good with good
           Is at cross purposes.

        "Workman of God! O lose not heart,
           But learn what God is like;
         And in the darkest battle-field
           Thou shalt know where to strike.

        "Muse on his justice, downcast soul!
           Muse, and take better heart;
         Back with thine angel to the field,
           Good luck shall crown thy part!

        "For right is right, since God is God;
           And right the day must win;
         To doubt would be disloyalty,
           To falter would be sin."

Hope on, be strong and of a good courage. For in the dark hours others will lean on you to
catch your hope and courage. Every power and force in the universe of environment makes for
the ultimate triumph of truth and right. Southeastern elevation pre-power in the one July-taken

Other material from TX is needed. It must not be retrieve that the locality of intermedius

 Think of the sensitiveness of governments to any wrong
done to their private citizens. England went to war with Abyssinia to protect and deliver two
Englishmen. And shall God do less? Can he do less? If it is only just and right and necessary
for earthly governments to thus care for their citizens, shall not the ruler and "judge of
all the earth do right?"

Now you and I are commanded to be heirs of God, to attain to likeness to him. This is therefore
our legal right, guaranteed by him, for every command of God is really a promise. And he will
exhaust every power in the universe before he allows anything to prevent us from gaining our
legal rights, provided only that we are earnest in claiming them.

But if I alienate my rights to my inheritance, the commonwealth cannot help me. If I renounce
my citizenship, the government of the United States can no longer protect me. And so I can
alienate my "right to the tree of life," and to entrance into the city, and I can forfeit my
heirship to all that God would give me. But I can alienate and make void every promise and
title, if I will or if I do not care. This is the unique glory, and awfulness of the human
will. And we know that to them that love God all things work together for good. "If God is
for us who is against us?" It must be so if God's laws are his modes of aiding men to conform
to environment.

And what of the church? Is it anything else or other than a means of aiding man to conform
to environment? If it fails of this, can it be any longer the church of God? The church is
a means, not an end. And it is a means of godlikeness in man.

Some would make it a social club. The bond of union between its members is their common grade
of wealth, social position, or intellectual attainments. And this idea of the church has deeper
root in the minds of us all than we think. I can imagine a far better club than one formed
and framed on this principle, but it is difficult for me to imagine a worse counterfeit of
a church. Others make it a source of intellectual delectation, and the means of hearing one
or two striking sermons each week. Such a church will conduce to the intelligence of its members,
and may be rather more, though probably less, useful than the old New England Lyceum lecture
system. Such a church is of about as much practical value to the world at large as some consultations
of physicians are to their patients. The doctors have a most interesting discussion, but the
patient dies, and the nature of the disease is discovered at the autopsy. Others still would
make of the church a great railroad system, over which sleeping-cars run from the City of Destruction,
with a coupon good to admit one to the Golden City at the other end. The coaches are luxurious
and the road-bed smooth. The Slough of Despond has been filled, the Valley of Humiliation bridged
at its narrowest point, and the Delectable Mountains tunnelled. But scoffers say that most
of the passengers make full use of the unlimited stop-over privileges allowed at Vanity Fair.

The Bible would seem to give the impression that the church is the army of the Lord of Hosts,
a disciplined army of hardy, heroic souls, each soldier aiding his fellow in working out the
salvation which God is working in him. And it joins battle fiercely and fearlessly with every
form of sin and misery, counting not the odds against it. And the Salvation Army seems to me
to have conceived and realized to a great extent just what at least one corps in this grand
army can and should be. And you and I can learn many a lesson from them.

The church is the body of which Christ is the head, and you and I are "members in particular."
Let us see to it that we are not the weak spot in the body, crippling and maiming the whole.
The church is the city of God among men, and we are its citizens, bound by its laws, loyal
servants of the Great King, sworn to obey his commands and enlarge his kingdom, and repel all
the assaults of his adversaries. Thus the Bible seems to me to depict the church of God. But
what if the army contains a multitude of men who will not obey orders or submit to discipline?
or if the city be overwhelmed with a mass of aliens, who see in its laws and institutions mainly
means of selfish individual advantage? Responsibility, not privilege, is the foundation of
strong character in both men and institutions. There was a good grain of truth in the old Scotch
minister's remark, that they had had a blessed work of grace in his church; they had not taken
anybody in, but a lot had gone out.

There are plenty of churches of Laodicea to-day. May you be delivered from them. But, thank
God, there are also churches of Philadelphia and Smyrna. May you be pastors of one of the latter.
It will not pay you a very large salary, for Demas has gone to the church of Laodicea, because
the minister of the church of Smyrna was not orthodox, or not sufficiently spiritually minded--meaning
thereby that he rebuked the sins of actual living men in general, and of Demas in particular--or
preached politics, and did not mind his business. And your church may be small. For many of
the congregation have gone to the church around the other corner, which is mainly a cluster
of associations, having excellent names, and useful for almost every purpose except building
up a manly, rugged, heroic, godlike character. The minister there, they will tell you, preaches
delightful sermons. They make you "feel so good." He annihilates pantheism, and his denunciations
of materialism are eloquent in the extreme. But his incarnations of materialism are Huxley
and Darwin, and to the uncharitable he seems to almost carefully avoid any language which might
seem to reflect upon the dollar- and place-worship of some of the occupants of his front pews.
Now, I am not here to defend Mr. Huxley or Mr. Darwin. Withstand them to the face wherever
they are to be blamed. And for some utterances they are undoubtedly to be blamed, honest souls
as they were. But I for one cannot help feeling that there is among the "dwellers in Jerusalem"
a materialism of the heart which is indefinitely worse than any intellectual heresy. When you
hit at the one heresy strike hard at the other also.

Many will have left your little church of Smyrna. It had to be so. For the divine sifting process,
which is natural selection on its highest plane, has not ceased to work. It must and shall
still go on; it cannot be otherwise.

But do not be discouraged. Preach Christ and a heroic Christianity. Do not be afraid to demand
great things of your people. Remember that Ananias was encouraged to go to Paul because the
Lord would show Paul how great things he should suffer for the name of Jesus. This is what
appeals to the heroic in every man, and we do not make nearly enough use of it. And the heroic
Christ and his heroic Christianity will draw every heroic soul in the community to himself.
They may not be very heroic looking. You may be in some hill town in old Massachusetts "Nurse
of heroes." Pardon me, I do not intend to be invidious. Heroism is cosmopolitan. One of the
pillars of your church may be the school-teacher of the little red school-house at the fork
of the roads, in the yard ornamented with alders, mulleins, and sumachs. She boards around,
and is clad in anything but silks and sealskins. But she trains well her band of hardy little
fellows, who will later fear the multitude as little as they now mind the Berkshire winds.
And from the pittance she receives for training these rebellious urchins into heroic men she
is supporting an old mother somewhere, or helping a brother to an education. And your deacon
will be some farmer, perhaps uncouth in appearance and rough of dress, and certainly blunt
in his scanty speech. He'll not flatter you nor your sermons; and until you've lived with him
for years you will not know what a great heart there is in that rugged frame, and what wealth
of affection in that silent hand-shake. And there is his wife. She is round and ample, and
certainly does not look especially solemn or pious. She is aunt and mother to the whole community,
the joy of all the children, nurse of the sick, and comfort of the dying. She is doing the
work of ten at home, and of a host in the village. And your right-hand man is great Onesiphorus
from the mill down in the valley, fighting an uphill battle to keep the wolf from the door,
while he and his wife deny themselves everything, that their flock of children may have better
training for fighting God's battles than they ever enjoyed.

I cannot describe these men and women. If you have lived with them, you will need no description,
and would resent the inadequacy of mine. If you have never had the good fortune to live with
them, it is impossible to make you see them as they are. When you once have thoroughly known
them, language will fail you to do them justice, and you will prefer to be silent rather than
slander them by inadequate portrayal. They are at first sight not attractive-looking. If you
stand outside and look at them from a distance their lives will appear to you very humdrum
and prosaic. But remember that for almost thirty years our Lord lived just such a life in Nazareth,
making ploughs and yokes; and then, when the younger brothers and sisters were able to care
for themselves, snatched three years from supporting a peasant family in Galilee to redeem
a world. And who was Peter but a rough, hardy fisherman?

Now a Paul, trained at the feet of Gamaliel, was also needed; and the twelve did not come from
the lowest ranks of society. But they were honest, industrious, practical, courageous, hardy,
common people. And single-handed they went out to conquer empires. And they succeeded through
the power of God in them.

Who knows the possibilities of your little church in the hilltown of Smyrna? These men and
women are the pickets of God's great host. They are scattered up and down our land, fighting
alone the great battle, unknown of men and sometimes thinking that they must be forgotten of
God. And the picket's lonely post is what tries a man's courage and strength.

Take your example from Paul's epistle. Greet Phebe, the schoolmistress, and Aquila and Priscilla
on their rocky farm on the mountain-side, and greet the burden-bearing Onesiphorus. And give
them God's greeting and encouragement, for he sends it to them through you. Show them the heroism
which there is in their "humdrum" lives; and cheer them in the efforts, of whose grandeur they
are all unconscious. Bid them "be strong and of a very good courage." For in the character
of these people there is the granite of the eternal hills, and in their hearts should be the
sunshine of God. Do not be ashamed of your congregation. Their dimes or dollars may look pitifully
small and few on the collector's plate; only God sees the real immensity of the gift in the
self-denial which it has cost. Your people will take sides with the cause of right, while it
is still unpopular. They have furnished the moral backbone and unswerving integrity of many
of your great business houses in this city to-day. From those families will go forth the men
whom the good will trust and the evil fear. The power for good proceeding from your church
will be like the floods which Ezekiel saw pouring out from beneath the threshold of the Lord's
house.

For these common people, whom "God must have loved because he made so many of them," are the
true heirs to the future. And wealth and culture, art and learning, are to burn like torches
to light their march. Finally, my young brothers, do not be bitterly disappointed if you are
not "popular preachers." Do not let too many people go to sleep under your preaching, even
if one young man did go to sleep under one of Paul's sermons. But if now and then someone is
angry at what you have said, do not worry too much over it. Preach the truth in love. If Elijah
and John the Baptist, and Peter and Paul, were to preach to-day I doubt greatly whether they
would be popular preachers. I cannot find that they ever were so. They would probably be peripatetic
candidates, until someone supported them as independent evangelists. After their death we would
rear them great monuments, and then devote ourselves to railing at Timothy because he was not
more like what we imagine Paul was.

Even Socrates found that he must bid farewell to what men count honors, if he would follow
after truth. You may have the same experience. You will have to champion many an unpopular
cause, and your people will not like it. They will say you lack tact. Now Paul was a man of
infinite tact. Witness his sermon on Mars' Hill. But if his letters to the church in Corinth
were addressed to most modern churches, they would soon set out in search of a pastor of greater
adaptability.

If you play the man, and fight the good fight of faith, I do not see how you can always avoid
hitting somebody on the other side. And he will pull you down if he can; and will probably
succeed in sometimes making your life very uncomfortable. Remember the teaching of scripture
and science, that the upward path was never intended to be easy. The scriptural passages to
this effect you can find all through the gospels and epistles, and I need not quote them to
you. I will, however, tell you honestly that many are of the opinion that these passages are
now obsolete, being applicable only to the first centuries, or to especially critical times
in the history of the church. I cannot share that view, but, lest I seem too old-fashioned,
will merely quote the ringing words of our own Dr. Hitchcock, that "no man ever enters heaven
save on his shield."

We must be strong and of a very good courage. While the avoidance of pain and discomfort, or
even happiness, cannot be the proper end of life, it is not a world of misery or an essentially
and hopelessly evil world. There is plenty of misery in the world, and we cannot deny it. Neither
can we deny that God has put us in the world to relieve misery, and that until we have made
every effort and strained every nerve as we have never yet done, we, and not God, are largely
responsible for it. But behind misery stand selfishness and sin as its cause. And here we must
not parley but fight. And the hosts of evil are organized and mighty. "The sons of this world
are for their own generation wiser than the sons of light." And we shall never overcome them
by adopting their means. But we can and shall surely overcome. For he that is with us is more
than they that be with them. "The skirmishes are frequently disastrous to us, but the great
battles all go one way." And we long for the glory of "him that overcometh." But the victor's
song can come only after the battle, and be sung only by those who have overcome. And we would
not have it otherwise if we could. The closing words of Dr. Hitchcock's last sermon are the
following:

"It is one of the revelations of scripture that we are to judge the angels, sitting above them
on the shining heights. It may well be so. Those angels are the imperial guard, doing easy
duty at home. We are the tenth legion, marching in from the swamps and forests of the far-off
frontier, scarred and battered, but victorious over death and sin."

CHAPTER X

PRESENT ASPECTS OF THE THEORY OF EVOLUTION

In all our study we have taken for granted the truth of the theory of evolution. If you are
not already persuaded of this by the writings of Darwin, Wallace, and many others, no words
or arguments of mine would convince you. We have used as the foundation of our argument only
the fundamental propositions of Mr. Darwin's theory.

But while all evolutionists accept these propositions they differ more or less in the weight
or efficiency which they assign to each. In a sum in multiplication you may gain the same product
by using different factors; but if the product is to be constant, if you halve one factor,
you must double another. Evolution is a product of many factors. One evolutionist lays more,
another less, emphasis on natural selection, according as he assigns less or more efficiency
to other forces or processes. Furthermore, evolutionists differ widely in questions of detail,
and some of these subsidiary questions are of great practical importance and interest. It may
be useful, therefore, to review these propositions in the light of the facts which we have
gathered, and to see how they are interpreted, and what emphasis is laid on each by different
thinkers.

The fundamental fact on which Mr. Darwin's theory rests is the "struggle for existence." Life
is not something to be idly enjoyed, but a prize to be won; the world is not a play-ground,
but an arena. And the severity of the struggle can scarcely be overrated. Only one or two of
a host of runners reach the goal, the others die along the course. Concerning this there can
be no doubt, and there is little room for difference of interpretation.

The struggle may take the form of a literal battle between two individuals, or of the individual
with inclemency of climate or other destructive agents. More usually it is a competition, no
more noticeable and no less real than that between merchants or manufacturers in the same line
of trade.

The weeds in our gardens compete with the flowers for food, light, and place, and crowd them
out unless prevented by man. And when the weeds alone remain, they crowd on each other until
only a few of the hardiest and most vigorous survive. And flowers, by their nectar, color,
and odor, compete for the visits of insects, which insure cross-fertilization. And fruits are
frequently or usually the inducements by which plants compete for the aid of animals in the
dissemination of their seeds. So there is everywhere competition and struggle; many fail and
perish, few succeed and survive.

In a foot-race it is often very difficult to name the winner. Muscle alone does not win, not
even good heart and lungs. Good judgment, patience, coolness, courage, many mental and moral
qualities, are essential to the successful athlete. So in the struggle for life. The race is
not always to the swift, nor the battle to the strong.

The total of "points" which wins this "grand prize" is the aggregate of many items, some of
which appear to us very insignificant. Hence, when we ask, "Who will survive?" the answer is
necessarily vague. Mr. Darwin's answer is, Those best conformed to their environment; and Mr.
Spencer's statement of the survival of the fittest means the same thing.

The judges who pronounce and execute the verdict of death, or award the prize of life, are
the forces and conditions of environment. We have already considered the meaning of this word.
Many of its forces and conditions are still unknown, or but very imperfectly understood. But
known or unknown, visible or invisible, the result of their united action is the extinction
or degradation of these individuals which deviate from certain fairly well-marked lines of
development. We must keep clearly before our minds the fact that the world of living beings
makes up by far the most important part of the environment of any individual plant or animal.
Two plants may be equally well suited to the soil and climate of any region; but if one have
a scanty development of root or leaf, or is for any reason more liable to attacks from insects
or germs, other things being equal, it will in time be crowded out by its competitor. Worms
are eaten by lower vertebrates, and these by higher. An animal's environment, like that of
a merchant or manufacturer, is very largely a matter of the ability and methods of its competitors.
And man, compelled to live in society, makes that part of the environment by which he is most
largely moulded.

This process of extinction Mr. Darwin has called "natural selection." Natural selection is
not a force, but a process, resulting from the combined action of the forces of environment.
It is not a cause in any proper sense of the word, but a result of a myriad of interacting
forces. The combination of these forces in a process of natural selection leading directly
to a moral and spiritual goal demands an explanation in some ultimate cause. This explanation
we have already tried to find.

It is a process of extinction. It favors the fittest, but only by leaving them to enjoy the
food and place formerly claimed, or still furnished, by the less fit. In any advancing group,
as the less fit are crowded out, and the better fitted gain more place and food and more rapid
increase, the whole species becomes on an average better conformed. More abundant nourishment
and increased vigor seem also to be accompanied by increased variation. And by the extinction
of the less fit the probability is increased that more fit individuals will pair with one another
and give rise to even fitter offspring, possessing perhaps new and still more valuable variations.

But if, of a group of weaker forms, those alone survive which adopt a parasitic life, those
which in adult life move the least will survive and reproduce; there will result the survival
of the least muscular and nervous. This degeneration will continue until the species has sunken
into equilibrium, so to speak, with its surroundings. Here natural selection works for degeneration.
Sessile animals have had a similar history. But these parasitic and sessile forms had already
been hopelessly distanced in the race for life. Their presence cannot impede the leaders; indeed
their survival is necessary to directly or indirectly furnish food for the better conformed.
In the animal and plant world there is abundant room and advantage at the top.

Once more, natural selection works as a rule for the survival of individuals, only indirectly
for that of organs composing, or of species including, these individuals. It may work for the
development of a trait or structure which, while of no immediate advantage to the individual,
increases the probability of its rearing a larger number of fitter offspring. Thus defence
of the young by birds may be a disadvantage to the parent, but this is more than counterbalanced
in the life of the species by the number of young coming to maturity and inheriting the trait.
Even here natural selection favors the survival of the trait indirectly by sparing the descendants
of the individual possessing it. Natural selection may always work on and through individuals
without always working for their sole and selfish advantage.

In human society we find the selection of families, societies, nations, and civilizations going
on, but mainly as the result of the survival of the fittest individuals.

There may very probably be a struggle for existence between organs or cells in the body of
each individual. The amount of nutriment in the body is a more or less fixed quantity; and
if one organ seizes more than its fair share, others may or must diminish for lack. But the
limit to this usurpation must apparently be set by the crowding out of those individuals in
which it is carried too far. Natural selection, so to speak, leaves the individual responsible
for the distribution of the nutriment among the organs, and spares or destroys the individual
as this usurpation proves for its advantage or disadvantage.

It makes its verdict much as the judges at a great poultry or dog show count the series of
points, giving each one of them a certain value on a certain scale, and then award the prize
to the individual having the highest aggregate on the whole series. The 5,000 organs on muscle is
a higher Eden, the Juvenile that it became to Joseph, more framework of great Madonna, and mislead
the Deum of the complete vertebrates to a adopter on structure.

Announcement in Joseph of child. The little clerestory under ascendant
and art the Jesus of a class at the light as the entertainment was

 Let us now imagine that an animal is
so constructed as to be capable of variation along several disadvantageous or neutral lines,
and along only one which is advantageous. The development would of course proceed along the
advantageous line. Let us farther imagine that to the descendants of this individual two, and
only two, advantageous lines of variations are allowed by its structure. Then natural selection
would probably favor the decidedly advantageous line, if such there were. But as long as the
structure of the animal allows variation along only a few lines, the two advantageous variations
would, according to the law of probabilities, frequently occur in the same individual. The
eggs and spermatozoa of two such individuals might not infrequently unite, and thus in time
the two characteristics be inherited by a large fraction of the species.

Can thus natural selection, acting upon fortuitous variations, be the sole guiding process
concerned in progress? Must there not be some combining power to produce the higher individuals
which are prerequisites to the working of natural selection?

We are considering the efficiency of natural selection in enhancing useful variations through
a series of generations. Let us return to the distinction between productiveness and prospectiveness
of social capital. Applied to variations productiveness means immediate advantage, prospectiveness
the greater future and permanent returns. Now all persisting variations must, in animals below
man, apparently be somewhat productive, else they would not continue, much less increase. Now
the immediate return from prospective variations is often smaller than from productive. It
looks at first as if productive variations would always be preserved by natural selection,
and that prospective variations would not long advance. Yet in the muscular system variations
valuable largely for their future value are neither few nor unimportant. How can the brain
in its infancy develop until it gains supremacy over muscle, or muscle have done the same with
digestion? Now a partial explanation of this is to be found in the correlation of organs. This
is therefore a factor of vast importance in progress through evolution.

Progress in any one line demands correlated changes in many organs. Thus in the advance of
annelids to insects the muscular system increases in relative bulk, and absolutely in complexity.
But a change or increase in the muscle must be accompanied by corresponding changes in the
motor-nerve fibrils; and these again would be useless unless accompanied by increased complexity
and more or less readjustment of the cells and fibrils of the nerve-centres. And all these
additions to, and readjustments of, the nerve-centres must take place without any disturbance
of the other necessary adjustments already attained. This is no simple problem.

We will here neglect the fact that many other changes are going on simultaneously. Legs are
being formed or moulded into jaws, the anterior segments are fusing into a head, and their
ganglia into a brain; an external skeleton is developing. Furthermore the increase of the muscular
and nervous systems must be accompanied by increased powers of digestion, respiration, and
excretion. Practically the whole body is being recast. We insist only on the necessity of simultaneous
and parallel changes in muscles, nerves, and nerve-centres; though what is true of these is
true, in greater or less degree, of all the other organs.

You may answer that this is to be explained by the law of correlation of organs; that when
changes in one organ demand corresponding changes in another, these two change similarly and
more or less at the same time and rate. But this is evidently not an explanation but a restatement
of the fact. The question remains, What makes the organs vary simultaneously so as to always
correspond to each other? The whole series of changes must to some extent be effected at once
and in the same individual, if it is to be preserved by natural selection. Fortuitous variations
here and there along the line of the series are of little or no avail. That the whole series
of variations should happen to occur in one animal is altogether against the law of probabilities;
if the favorable variation occurs in only a part of the series it remains useless until the
corresponding variation has taken place in the other terms. And while the variation is thus
awaiting its completion, so to speak, it is useless, and cannot be fostered by natural selection.

Evolution by means of fortuitous variations, combined and controlled only through natural selection,
seems to me at least impossible; and this view is, I think, steadily gaining ground.

Natural selection, while a real and very important factor in evolution, cannot be its sole
and exclusive explanation. It presupposes other factors, which we as yet but dimly perceive.
And this does not impeach the validity of Mr. Darwin's theory any more than Newton's theory
of gravitation is impeached by the fact that it offers no explanation as to why the apple falls
or how bodies attract one another.

For natural selection explains the survival, but not the origin, of the fittest. Given a species
or other group composed of more and less fit individuals and the fittest will survive. How
does it come about that there are any more and less fit individuals? This brings us to the
consideration of the subject of variation.

Let us begin with a simple case of change in the adult body. The workman grasps his tools day
after day, and his hands become horny. The skin has evidently thickened, somewhat as on the
soles of the feet. This is no mere mechanical result of pressure alone. Continuous pressure
would produce the opposite result. But under the stimulus of intermittent pressure the capillaries,
or smallest blood vessels, furnish more nutriment to the cells composing the lowest layer of
the outer skin or epidermis. These cells, being better nourished, reproduce by division more
rapidly, and the epidermis, becoming composed of a greater number of layers of cells, thickens.
The outer-most layers, being farthest from the blood supply, dry up and are packed together
into a horny mass.

If I go out into the sunshine I become tanned. This again is not a direct and purely chemical
or physical result of the sun's rays, but these have stimulated the cells of the skin to undergo
certain modifications. Any change in the living body under changed conditions is not passive,
but an active reaction to a stimulus furnished by the surroundings. The same stimulus may excite
very different reactions in different individuals or species.

Early in this century a farmer, Seth Wright, found among his lambs a young ram with short legs
and long body. The farmer kept the ram, reasoning that his short legs would prevent him from
leading the flock over the farm-walls and fences. From this ram was descended the breed of
ancon, or otter, sheep. Now the stimulus which had excited this variation must have been applied
early in embryonic life, or perhaps during the formation or maturing of the germ-cells themselves.
Such a variation we call a congenital variation.

These cases are merely illustrations of the general truth that in every variation there are
two factors concerned: the living being with its constitution and inherent tendencies and the
external stimulus.

The courses of the different balls in a charge of grape-shot, hurled from a cannon, are evidently
due to two sets of forces--1, their initial energy and the direction of their aim; 2, the deflecting
power of resisting objects or forces--or the different balls might roll with great velocity
down a precipitous mountain-side. In the first case velocity and direction of course would
be determined largely by initial impulse; in the second, by the attraction of the earth and
by the inequalities of its surface.

In evolution, environment, roughly speaking, corresponds to these deflecting or attracting
external objects or forces; inherent tendencies to initial impulse. If we lay great weight
on initial tendencies, inherent in protoplasm from the very beginning, we shall probably lay
less stress on natural selection as a guiding, directing process.

The great botanist, Nägeli, has propounded a most ingenious and elaborate theory of evolution,
as dependent mainly on inherent initial tendency. We can notice only one or two of its salient
points. All development is, according to his view, due to a tendency in the primitive living
substance toward more complete division of labor and greater complexity. This tendency, which
he calls progression, or the tendency toward perfection, is the result of the chemical and
molecular structure of the formative controlling protoplasm (idioplasm) of the body, and is
transmitted with other parental traits from generation to generation. And structural complexity
thus increases like money at compound interest. Development is a process of unfolding or of
realization of the possibilities of this tendency under the stimulus of surrounding influences.
Environment plays an essential part in his system. But only such changes are transmissible
to future generations as have resulted from modifications arising in the idioplasm. Descendants
of plants which have varied under changed conditions revert, as a rule, to the old type, when
returned to the old surroundings. And in the animal world effects of use and disuse are, according
to his view, not transmissible.

Natural selection plays a very subordinate part. It is purely destructive. Given an infinity
of place and nourishment--do away, that is, with all struggle and selection--and the living
world would have advanced, purely by the force of the progressive tendency, just as far as
it now has; only there would have survived an indefinite number of intermediate forms. It would
have differed from our present living world as the milky way does from the starry firmament.

He compares the plant kingdom to a great, luxurious tree, branching from its very base, whose
twigs would represent the present stage of our different species. Left to itself it would put
out a chaos of innumerable branches. Natural selection, like a gardener, prunes the tree into
shape. Children might imagine that the gardener caused the growth; but the tree would have
been broader and have branched more luxuriantly if left to itself.[A]

  [Footnote A: See Nägeli, "Theorie der Abstammungslehre," p. 18;
  also pp. 12, 118, 285.]

Every species must vary perpetually. Now this proposition is apparently not in accord with
fact; for some have remained unchanged during immense periods. And natural selection, by removing
the less fit, certainly appears to contribute to progress by raising the average of the species.
The theory seems extreme and one-sided. And yet it has done great service by calling in question
the all-sufficiency of natural selection and the modifying power of environment, and by emphasizing,
probably overmuch, the importance of initial inherent tendency, whose value has been entirely
neglected by many evolutionists.

Lack of space compels us to leave unnoticed most of the exceedingly valuable suggestions of
Nägeli's brilliant work.

It is still less possible to do any justice in a few words to Weismann's theory. Into its various
modifications, as it has grown from year to year, we have no time to enter. And we must confine
ourselves to his views of variation and heredity.

In studying protozoa we noticed that they reproduced by fission, each adult individual dividing
into two young ones. There is therefore no old parent left to die. Natural death does not occur
here, only death by violence or unfavorable conditions. The protozoa are immortal, not in the
sense of the endless persistence of the individual, but of the absence of death. Heredity is
here easily comprehensible, for one-half, or less frequently a smaller fraction, of the substance
of the parent goes to form the new individual. There is direct continuity of substance from
generation to generation.

But in volvox a change has taken place. The fertilized egg-cell, formed by the union of egg
and spermatozoon, is a single cell, like the individual resulting from the conjugation or fusion
of two protozoa. But in the many-celled individual, which develops out of the fertilized egg,
there are two kinds of cells. 1. There are other egg-cells, like the first, each one of which
can, under favorable conditions, develop into a multicellular individual like the parent. And
the germ-cells (eggs and spermatozoa) of volvox are immortal like the protozoa. But, 2, there
are nutritive, somatic cells, which nourish and transport the germ-cells, and after their discharge
die. These somatic cells, being mortal, differ altogether from the germ-cells and the protozoa.
The protoplasm must differ in chemical, or molecular, or other structure in the two cases,
and we distinguish the germ-plasm of the germ-cells, resembling in certain respects Nägeli's
idioplasm, from somatoplasm, which performs most of the functions of the cell. The somatoplasm
arises from, and hence must be regarded as a modification of, the germ-plasm. The germ-plasm
can increase indefinitely in the lapse of generations, increase of the somatoplasm is limited.

Specimens in the last borne glory are identify with the symbol ku. This underground rootstock would represent the
continuous germ-plasm of successive generations; the plants which yearly arise from it would
represent the successive generations of adult individuals, composed mainly of somatoplasm.
Or we may imagine a long chain, with a pendant attached to each tenth or one-hundredth link.
The links of the chain would represent the series of generations of germ-cells; the pendants,
the adults of successive generations.

But any leaf of begonia can be made to develop into a new plant, giving rise to germ-cells.
Here there must be scattered through the leaves of the plant small portions of germ-plasm,
which generally remain dormant, and only under special conditions increase and give rise to
germ-cells.

A large part of the germ-plasm of the fertilized egg is used to give rise to the somatoplasm
composing the different systems of the embryo and adult. Weismann's explanation of this change
of germ-plasm into somatoplasm is very ingenious, and depends upon his theory of the structure
of the germ-plasm; and this latter theory forms the basis of his theory of evolution. It would
take too long to state his theory of the structure of germ-plasm, but an illustration may present
fairly clear all that is of special importance to us.

The molecules of germ-plasm are grouped in units, and these in an ascending series of units
of continually increasing complexity, until at last we find the highest unit represented in
the nucleus of the germ-cell. This grouping of molecules in units of increasing complexity
is like the grouping of the men of an army in companies, regiments, brigades, divisions, etc.
