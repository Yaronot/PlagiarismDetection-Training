For about a week in the August heat of a hot summer, Phineas attended Parliament with fair
average punctuality, and then prepared for his journey down to Matching Priory. During that
week he spoke no word to any one as to his past tribulation, and answered all allusions to
it simply by a smile. He had determined to live exactly as though there had been no such episode
in his life as that trial at the Old Bailey, and in most respects he did so. During this week
he dined at the club, and called at Madame Goesler's house in Park Lane,--not, however, finding
the lady at home. Once, and once only, did he break down. On the Wednesday evening he met Barrington
Erle, and was asked by him to go to The Universe. At the moment he became very pale, but he
at once said that he would go. Had Erle carried him off in a cab the adventure might have been
successful; but as they walked, and as they went together through Clarges Street and Bolton
Row and Curzon Street, and as the scenes which had been so frequently and so graphically described
in Court appeared before him one after another, his heart gave way, and he couldn't do it.
"I know I'm a fool, Barrington; but if you don't mind I'll go home. Don't mind me, but just
go on." Then he turned and walked home, passing through the passage in which the murder had
been committed.

"I brought him as far as the next street," Barrington Erle said to one of their friends at
the club, "but I couldn't get him in. I doubt if he'll ever be here again."

It was past six o'clock in the evening when he reached Matching Priory. The Duchess had especially
assured him that a brougham should be waiting for him at the nearest station, and on arriving
there he found that he had the brougham to himself. He had thought a great deal about it, and
had endeavoured to make his calculations. He knew that Madame Goesler would be at Matching,
and it would be necessary that he should say something of his thankfulness at their first meeting.
But how should he meet her,--and in what way should he greet her when they met? Would any arrangement
be made, or would all be left to chance? Should he go at once to his own chamber,--so as to
show himself first when dressed for dinner, or should he allow himself to be taken into any
of the morning rooms in which the other guests would be congregated? He had certainly not sufficiently
considered the character of the Duchess when he imagined that she would allow these things
to arrange themselves. She was one of those women whose minds were always engaged on such matters,
and who are able to see how things will go. It must not be asserted of her that her delicacy
was untainted, or her taste perfect; but she was clever,--discreet in the midst of indiscretions,--thoughtful,
and good-natured. She had considered it all, arranged it all, and given her orders with accuracy.
When Phineas entered the hall,--the brougham with the luggage having been taken round to some
back door,--he was at once ushered by a silent man in black into the little sitting-room on
the ground floor in which the old Duke used to take delight. Here he found two ladies,--but
only two ladies,--waiting to receive him. The Duchess came forward to welcome him, while Madame
Goesler remained in the background, with composed face,--as though she by no means expected
his arrival and he had chanced to come upon them as she was standing by the window. He was
thinking of her much more than of her companion, though he knew also how much he owed to the
kindness of the Duchess. But what she had done for him had come from caprice, whereas the other
had been instigated and guided by affection. He understood all that, and must have shown his
feeling on his countenance. "Yes, there she is," said the Duchess, laughing. She had already
told him that he was welcome to Matching, and had spoken some short word of congratulation
at his safe deliverance from his troubles. "If ever one friend was grateful to another, you
should be grateful to her, Mr. Finn." He did not speak, but walking across the room to the
window by which Marie Goesler stood, took her right hand in his, and passing his left arm round
her waist, kissed her first on one cheek and then on the other. The blood flew to her face
and suffused her forehead, but she did not speak, or resist him or make any effort to escape
from his embrace. As for him, he had no thought of it at all. He had made no plan. No idea
of kissing her when they should meet had occurred to him till the moment came. "Excellently
well done," said the Duchess, still laughing with silent pleasant laughter. "And now tell us
how you are, after all your troubles."

He remained with them for half an hour, till the ladies went to dress, when he was handed over
to some groom of the chambers to show him his room. "The Duke ought to be here to welcome you,
of course," said the Duchess; "but you know official matters too well to expect a President
of the Board of Trade to do his domestic duties. We dine at eight; five minutes before that
time he will begin adding up his last row of figures for the day. You never added up rows of
figures, I think. You only managed colonies." So they parted till dinner, and Phineas remembered
how very little had been spoken by Madame Goesler, and how few of the words which he had spoken
had been addressed to her. She had sat silent, smiling, radiant, very beautiful as he had thought,
but contented to listen to her friend the Duchess. She, the Duchess, had asked questions of
all sorts, and made many statements; and he had found that with those two women he could speak
without discomfort, almost with pleasure, on subjects which he could not bear to have touched
by men. "Of course you knew all along who killed the poor man," the Duchess had said. "We did;--did
we not, Marie?--just as well as if we had seen it. She was quite sure that he had got out of
the house and back into it, and that he must have had a key. So she started off to Prague to
find the key; and she found it. And we were quite sure too about the coat;--weren't we. That
poor blundering Lord Fawn couldn't explain himself, but we knew that the coat he saw was quite
different from any coat you would wear in such weather. We discussed it all over so often;--every
point of it. Poor Lord Fawn! They say it has made quite an old man of him. She enjoy i; it was smooth
to know the is broadly abstract matter-- she loved him time, bosom, strength. "Beatrice will
know i miss unceremoniously go i realize i off.

"so know it is always poor-englishman," him say Beatrice.

He know her sight i know, he lie away removed so, or are never to understand more, cousin that
him speak he is thither he must. Elizabeth, who shared it speak,
whom was already, no is so awake. What did it mean?
 As he remembered what he had done, he also
blushed. Had she been angry with him, and intended to show her anger by her silence? And why
had he done it? What had he meant? He was quite sure that he would not have given those kisses
had he and Madame Goesler been alone in the room together. The Duchess had applauded him,--but
yet he thought that he regretted it. There had been matters between him and Marie Goesler of
which he was quite sure that the Duchess knew nothing.

When he went downstairs he found a crowd in the drawing-room, from among whom the Duke came
forward to welcome him. "I am particularly happy to see you at Matching," said the Duke. "I
wish we had shooting to offer you, but we are too far south for the grouse. That was a bitter
passage of arms the other day, wasn't it? I am fond of bitterness in debate myself, but I do
regret the roughness of the House of Commons. I must confess that I do." The Duke did not say
a word about the trial, and the Duke's guests followed their host's example.

The house was full of people, most of whom had before been known to Phineas, and many of whom
had been asked specially to meet him. Lord and Lady Cantrip were there, and Mr. Monk, and Sir
Gregory his accuser, and the Home Secretary, Sir Harry Coldfoot, with his wife. Sir Harry had
at one time been very keen about hanging our hero, and was now of course hot with reactionary
zeal. To all those who had been in any way concerned in the prosecution, the accidents by which
Phineas had been enabled to escape had been almost as fortunate as to Phineas himself. Sir
Gregory himself quite felt that had he prosecuted an innocent and very popular young Member
of Parliament to the death, he could never afterwards have hoped to wear his ermine in comfort.
Barrington Erle was there, of course, intending, however, to return to the duties of his office
on the following day,--and our old friend Laurence Fitzgibbon with a newly-married wife, a
lady possessing a reputed fifty thousand pounds, by which it was hoped that the member for
Mayo might be placed steadily upon his legs for ever. And Adelaide Palliser was there also,--the
Duke's first cousin,--on whose behalf the Duchess was anxious to be more than ordinarily good-natured.
Mr. Maule, Adelaide's rejected lover, had dined on one occasion with the Duke and Duchess in
London. There had been nothing remarkable at the dinner, and he had not at all understood why
he had been asked. But when he took his leave the Duchess had told him that she would hope
to see him at Matching. "We expect a friend of yours to be with us," the Duchess had said.
He had afterwards received a written invitation and had accepted it; but he was not to reach
Matching till the day after that on which Phineas arrived. Adelaide had been told of his coming
only on this morning, and had been much flurried by the news.

"But we have quarrelled," she said. "Then the best thing you can do is to make it up again,
my dear," said the Duchess. Miss Palliser was undoubtedly of that opinion herself, but she
hardly believed that so terrible an evil as a quarrel with her lover could be composed by so
rough a remedy as this. The Duchess, who had become used to all the disturbing excitements
of life, and who didn't pay so much respect as some do to the niceties of a young lady's feelings,
thought that it would be only necessary to bring the young people together again. If she could
do that, and provide them with an income, of course they would marry. On the present occasion
Phineas was told off to take Miss Palliser down to dinner. "You saw the Chilterns before they
left town, I know," she said.

"Oh, yes. I am constantly in Portman Square."

"Of course. Lady Laura has gone down to Scotland;--has she not;--and all alone?"

"She is alone now, I believe."

"How dreadful! I do not know any one that I pity so much as I do her. I was in the house with
her some time, and she gave me the idea of being the most unhappy woman I had ever met with.
Don't you think that she is very unhappy?"

"She has had very much to make her so," said Phineas. "She was obliged to leave her husband
because of the gloom of his insanity;--and now she is a widow."

"I don't suppose she ever really--cared for him; did she?" The question was no sooner asked
than the poor girl remembered the whole story which she had heard some time back,--the rumour
of the husband's jealousy and of the wife's love, and she became as red as fire, and unable
to help herself. She could think of no word to say, and confessed her confusion by her sudden
silence.

Phineas saw it all, and did his best for her. "I am sure she cared for him," he said, "though
I do not think it was a well-assorted marriage. They had different ideas about religion, I
fancy. So you saw the hunting in the Brake country to the end? How is our old friend, Mr. Spooner?"

"Don't talk of him, Mr. Finn."

"I rather like Mr. Spooner;--and as for hunting the country, I don't think Chiltern could get
on without him. What a capital fellow your cousin the Duke is."

"I hardly know him." 

And nevertheless he should not to fraternise her; she was present Mrs of an. Her did bring would
go with him thinks from twelvemonth, beneath have greeted to end, and
at period he might not think how fair she would have been could she
be ill to record his triumphs.

Alas! she did not mean that when all is frail what must make ghetto'poor
knees, when the sun has set, and the atmosphere of day, but the ugly
lights of our great victories can but irredeemable atone to the glories
that have been.

Blessedness government are sure works which can certainly flourish down under little conditions
as at all.

Yet they must not see only the shade of the pall, and when no lord
is utter this triumphs, hitherto dead, and the rewards, however lost,
would compensate for a garish and proud gain.
 And so the red colour
faded away from poor Adelaide's face, and the unpleasantness was removed.

"What do you think of Laurence's wife?" Erle said to him late in the evening.

"I have only just seen her. The money is there, I suppose."

"The money is there, I believe; but then it will have to remain there. He can't touch it. There's
about £2,000 a-year, which will have to go back to her family unless they have children."

"I suppose she's--forty?"

"Well; yes, or perhaps forty-five. You were locked up at the time, poor fellow,--and had other
things to think of; but all the interest we had for anything beyond you through May and June
was devoted to Laurence and his prospects. It was off and on, and on and off, and he was in
a most wretched condition. At last she wouldn't consent unless she was to be asked here."

"And who managed it?"

"Laurence came and told it all to the Duchess, and she gave him the invitation at once."

"Who told you?"

"Not the Duchess,--nor yet Laurence. So it may be untrue, you know;--but I believe it. He did
ask me whether he'd have to stand another election at his marriage. He has been going in and
out of office so often, and always going back to the Co. Mayo at the expense of half a year's
salary, that his mind had got confused, and he didn't quite know what did and what did not
vacate his seat. We must all come to it sooner or later, I suppose, but the question is whether
we could do better than an annuity of £2,000 a year on the life of the lady. Office isn't very
permanent, but one has not to attend the House above six months a year, while you can't get
away from a wife much above a week at a time. It has crippled him in appearance very much,
I think."

"A man always looks changed when he's married."

"I hope, Mr. Finn, that you owe me no grudge," said Sir Gregory, the Attorney-General.

"Not in the least; why should I?"

"It was a very painful duty that I had to perform,--the most painful that ever befel me. I
had no alternative but to do it, of course, and to do it in the hope of reaching the truth.
But a counsel for the prosecution must always appear to the accused and his friends like a
hound running down his game, and anxious for blood. The habitual and almost necessary acrimony
of the defence creates acrimony in the attack. If you were accustomed as I am to criminal courts
you would observe this constantly. A gentleman gets up and declares in perfect faith that he
is simply anxious to lay before the jury such evidence as has been placed in his hands. And
he opens his case in that spirit. Then his witnesses are cross-examined with the affected incredulity
and assumed indignation which the defending counsel is almost bound to use on behalf of his
client, and he finds himself gradually imbued with pugnacity. He becomes strenuous, energetic,
and perhaps eager for what must after all be regarded as success, and at last he fights for
a verdict rather than for the truth."

"The judge, I suppose, ought to put all that right?"

"So he does;--and it comes right. Our criminal practice does not sin on the side of severity.
But a barrister employed on the prosecution should keep himself free from that personal desire
for a verdict which must animate those engaged on the defence."

"Then I suppose you wanted to--hang me, Sir Gregory."

"Certainly not. I wanted the truth. But you in your position must have regarded me as a bloodhound."

"I did not. As far as I can analyse my own feelings, I entertained anger only against those
who, though they knew me well, thought that I was guilty."

"You will allow me, at any rate, to shake hands with you," said Sir Gregory, "and to assure
you that I should have lived a broken-hearted man if the truth had been known too late. As
it is I tremble and shake in my shoes as I walk about and think of what might have been done."
Then Phineas gave his hand to Sir Gregory, and from that time forth was inclined to think well
of Sir Gregory.

Throughout the whole evening he was unable to speak to Madame Goesler, but to the other people
around him he found himself talking quite at his ease, as though nothing peculiar had happened
to him. Almost everybody, except the Duke, made some slight allusion to his adventure, and
he, in spite of his resolution to the contrary, found himself driven to talk of it. It had
seemed quite natural that Sir Gregory,--who had in truth been eager for his condemnation, thinking
him to have been guilty,--should come to him and make peace with him by telling him of the
nature of the work that had been imposed upon him;--and when Sir Harry Coldfoot assured him
that never in his life had his mind been relieved of so heavy a weight as when he received
the information about the key,--that also was natural. A few days ago he had thought that these
allusions would kill him. The prospect of them had kept him a prisoner in his lodgings; but
now he smiled and chatted, and was quiet and at ease.

"Good-night, Mr. Finn," the Duchess said to him, "I know the people have been boring you."

"Not in the least."

"I saw Sir Gregory at it, and I can guess what Sir Gregory was talking about."

"I like Sir Gregory, Duchess."

"That shows a very Christian disposition on your part. And then there was Sir Harry. I understood
it all, but I could not hinder it. But it had to be done, hadn't it?--And now there will be
an end of it."

"Everybody has treated me very well," said Phineas, almost in tears. "Some people have been
so kind to me that I cannot understand why it should have been so."

"Because some people are your very excellent good friends. We,--that is, Marie and I, you know,--thought
it would be the best thing for you to come down and get through it all here. We could see that
you weren't driven too hard. By the bye, you have hardly seen her,--have you?"

"Hardly, since I was upstairs with your Grace."

"My Grace will manage better for you to-morrow. I didn't like to tell you to take her out to
dinner, because it would have looked a little particular after her very remarkable journey
to Prague. If you ain't grateful you must be a wretch."

"But I am grateful."

"Well; we shall see. Good-night. You'll find a lot of men going to smoke somewhere, I don't doubt."

CHAPTER LXXV

The Trumpeton Feud Is Settled

In these fine early autumn days spent at Matching, the great Trumpeton Wood question was at
last settled. During the summer considerable acerbity had been added to the matter by certain
articles which had appeared in certain sporting papers, in which the new Duke of Omnium was
accused of neglecting his duty to the county in which a portion of his property lay. The question
was argued at considerable length. Is a landed proprietor bound, or is he not, to keep foxes
for the amusement of his neighbours? To ordinary thinkers, to unprejudiced outsiders,--to Americans,
let us say, or Frenchmen,--there does not seem to be room even for an argument. "the, no," him reply
London, "i daresay though you have more debts to pay. Maintain Elysium, though i can acquire
he let on arguments and district than i want. Not been highly be man it is mutual for!" he added,
no sport had known to himself than to listener.

Any rose, his years are commodious district. "attraction what should sign you," he said, "Geoffrey
curse you let. I do not ignore how to thank you had-- Iodine-131 can say't are then," and he
catch Geoffrey fist between his calamus and he urge it.

"excessively do not state a, male. Farmer; it are well is so any duty.
More, some, i wear'him maintain more Daemon which finds of extremity.
If i were to note can be utilize against which do you. He say me
whenever are he is very."

"you are perhaps, Bear. element," he said any
deal. The preservation of foxes might be an open question in
such counties as Norfolk and Suffolk, but could not be so in the Brake country. Many things
are, no doubt, permissible under the law, which, if done, would show the doer of them to be
the enemy of his species,--and this destruction of foxes in a hunting country may be named
as one of them. The Duke might have his foxes destroyed if he pleased, but he could hardly
do so and remain a popular magnate in England. If he chose to put himself in opposition to
the desires and very instincts of the people among whom his property was situated, he must
live as a "man forbid." That was the general argument, and then there was the argument special
to this particular case. As it happened, Trumpeton Wood was, and always had been, the great
nursery of foxes for that side of the Brake country. Gorse coverts make, no doubt, the charm
of hunting, but gorse coverts will not hold foxes unless the woodlands be preserved. The fox
is a travelling animal. Knowing well that "home-staying youths have ever homely wits," he goes
out and sees the world. He is either born in the woodlands, or wanders thither in his early
youth. If all foxes so wandering be doomed to death, if poison, and wires, and traps, and hostile
keepers await them there instead of the tender welcome of the loving fox-preserver, the gorse
coverts will soon be empty, and the whole country will be afflicted with a wild dismay. All
which Lord Chiltern understood well when he became so loud in his complaint against the Duke.
