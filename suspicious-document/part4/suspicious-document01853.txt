THE number of sins a person may commit is well-nigh incalculable, which is only one way of
saying that the malice of man has invented innumerable means of offending the Almighty--a compliment
to our ingenuity and the refinement of our natural perversity. It is not always pleasant to
know, and few people try very hard to learn, of what kind and how many are their daily offenses.
This knowledge reveals too nakedly our wickedness which we prefer to ignore. Catholics, however,
who believe in the necessity of confession of sins, take a different view of the matter. The
requirements of a good confession are such as can be met only by those who know in what things
they have sinned and how often.

There are many different kinds of sin. It is possible by a single act to commit more than one
sin. And a given sin may be repeated any number of times.

To get the exact number of our misdeeds we must begin by counting as many sins at least as
there are kinds of sin. We might say there is an offense for every time a commandment or precept
is violated, for sin is a transgression of the law. But this would be insufficient inasmuch
as the law may command or forbid more than one thing.

Let the first commandment serve as an example. It is broken by sins against faith, or unbelief,
against hope, or despair, against charity, against religion, etc. All these offenses are specifically
different, that is, are different kinds of sin; yet but one precept is transgressed. Since
therefore each commandment prescribes the practice of certain virtues, the first rule is that
there is a sin for every virtue violated.

But this is far from exhausting our capacity for evil. Our virtue may impose different obligations,
so that against it alone we may offend in many different ways. Among the virtues prescribed
by the first commandment is that of religion, which concerns the exterior homage due to God.
I may worship false gods, thus offending against the virtue of religion, and commit a sin of
idolatry. If I offer false homage to the true God, I also violate the virtue of religion, but
commit a sin specifically different, a sin of superstition. Thus these different offenses are
against but one of several virtues enjoined by one commandment. The virtue of charity is also
prolific of obligations; the virtue of chastity even more so. One act against the latter may
contain a four-fold malice.

It would be out of place here to adduce more examples: a detailed treatment of the virtues
and commandments will make things clearer. For the moment it is necessary and sufficient to
know that a commandment may prescribe many virtues, a virtue may impose many obligations, and
there is a specifically different sin for each obligation violated.

But we can go much farther than this in wrongdoing, and must count one sin every time the act
is committed.

"Yes, but how are we to know when there is one act or more than one act! An act may be of long
or short duration. How many sins do I commit if the act lasts, say, two hours? And how can
I tell where one act ends and the other begins?"

In an action which endures an hour or two hours, there may be one and there may be a dozen
acts. When the matter a sinner is working on is a certain, specified evil, the extent to which
he prevaricates numerically depends upon the action of the will. A fellow who enters upon the
task of slaying his neighbor can kill but once in fact; but he can commit the sin of murder
in his soul once or a dozen times. It depends on the will. Sin is a deliberate transgression,
that is, first of all an act of the will. If he resolves once to kill and never retracts till
the deed of blood is done, he sins but once. If he disavows his resolution and afterwards resolves
anew, he repeats the sin of murder in his soul as often as he goes through this process of
will action. This sincere retraction of a deed is called moral interruption and it has the
mysterious power of multiplying sins.

Not every interruption is a moral one. To put the matter aside for a certain while in the hope
of a better opportunity, for the procuring of necessary facilities or for any other reason,
with the unshaken purpose of pursuing the course entered upon, is to suspend action; but this
action is wholly exterior, and does not affect the will. If truly, the details of life is reduce
of besides better command, formerly as the today mind such ladder off rise, activity may dwell
those vade-mecum, because him aspire to conduct of the as it will
not but set. FOOTNOTES: [2] a Baker: Sketch at Mr, Butte. Arthur, the.

of the miser. 'Tis true that this is one of the few vices that arrive at permanent advantages,
the others offering satisfaction that lasts but for a moment, and leaves nothing but bitterness
behind. Yet, the more the miser possesses the more insatiable his greed becomes, and the less
his enjoyment, by reason of the redoubled efforts he makes to have and to hold.

It is the nature of this vice to cause unhappiness which increases until it becomes positive
wretchedness in the miser. Anxiety of mind is followed by hardening of the heart; then injustice
in desire and in fact; blinding of the conscience, ending in a general stultification of man
before the god Mammon.

All desires of riches and comfort are not, therefore, avarice. One may aspire to, and seek
wealth without avidity. This ambition is a laudable one, for it does not exaggerate the value
of the world's goods, would not resort to injustice, and has not the characteristic tenacity
of covetousness. The aright has misdirected at self round; read the inscription:'Virtue'--'best
