The next morning I was awakened by a rumbling in the lower hold, as if the cargo was being
shifted. Then came a noise like the moving of heavy barrels on the upper deck forward of the
companionway. The next instant my door was burst open, and in stalked two brawny, big-armed
fish-girls, yarn-stockinged to their knees, and with white sabots and caps. They were trundling
the lower half of a huge hogshead.

"Pour le bain, monsieur," they both called out, bursting into laughter, as they rolled the
mammoth tub behind my bed, grounded it with a revolving whirl, as a juggler would spin a plate,
and disappeared, slamming the door behind them, their merriment growing fainter as they dropped
down the companionway.

I peered over the head-board, and discovered the larger half of an enormous storage-barrel
used for packing fish, with fresh saw-marks indenting its upper rim. Then I shouted for Bäader.

Before anybody answered, there came another onslaught, and in burst the same girls, carrying
a great iron beach-kettle filled with water. This, with renewed fits of laughter, they dashed
into the tub, and in a flash were off again, their wooden sabots clattering down the steps.

In five minutes we stood before a small, two-story house, with its door and wide basement-window
protected by an awning. Beneath this, upon low shelves, was arranged a collection of wicker
baskets, containing the several varieties of oysters from Normandy and Brittany coasts greatly
beloved by Parisian epicures of Paris. On the top of each lid lay a tin sign bearing the name
of the exact locality from which each toothsome bivalve was supposed to be shipped. These signs
were all of one size.

The governor is a great lover of oysters, especially his own Chesapeakes, and his eye ran rapidly
over the tempting exhibit as he read aloud, perhaps, unconsciously, to himself, the several
labels: "Dinard, Paramé, Dieppe petite, Cancale spéciale." Do he say that there exist in the cancale

 Between the acts most of them swarm out
into the adjacent corridors leading to the gaming-rooms,--licensed rooms these, with toy-horses
ridden by tin jockeys, and another equally delusive and tempting device of the devil--a game
of tipsy marbles, rolling about in search of sunken saucers emblazoned with the arms of the
nations of the earth. These whirligigs of amateur crime are constantly surrounded by eager-eyed
men and women, who try their luck for the amusement of the moment, or by broken-down, seedy
gamblers, hazarding their last coin for a turn of fortune. Now and then, too, some sweet-faced
girl, her arm in her father's, wins a louis with a franc, her childish laughter ringing out
in the stifling atmosphere.

The Tyrolean warbler had just finished her high-keyed falsetto, bowing backward in her short
skirts and stout shoes with silver buckles, and I had just reached the long corridor on my
way to the garden, to escape the blare and pound of the band, when a man leaned out of a half-opened
door and touched my shoulder.

"Pardon, monsieur. May I speak to you a moment?"

He was a short, thick-set, smooth-shaven, greasy man, dressed plainly in black, with a huge
emerald pin in his shirt front. I have never had any particular use for a man with an emerald
pin in his shirt front.

"There will be a game of baccarat," he continued in a low voice, his eyes glancing about furtively,
"at eleven o'clock precisely. Knock twice at this door."

Old habitués of Lucerne--habitués of years, men who never cross the Alps without at least a
day's stroll under the Noah's-ark trees,--will tell you over their coffee that since the opening
of the St. Gotthard Tunnel this half-way house of Lucerne--this oasis between Paris and Rome--has
sheltered most of the adventurers of Europe; that under these same trees, and on these very
benches, nihilists have sat and plotted, refugees and outlaws have talked in whispers, and
adventuresses, with jeweled stilettos tucked in their bosoms, have lain in wait for fresher
victims.

Her features were clean-cut and refined, her mouth and nose delicately shaped. Her forehead
was shaded by waves of brown hair which half covered her ears. The eyes were large and softened
by long lashes, the lids red as if with recent weeping. Her only ornament was a plain gold
ring, worn on her left hand. Outwardly, she was the only person in the room who betrayed by
her manner any vital interest in the game.

There are some faces that once seen haunt you forever afterward--faces with masks so thinly
worn that you look through into the heart below. Hers was one of these. Every light and shadow
of hope and disappointment that crossed it showed only the clearer the intensity of her mental
strain, and the bitterness of her anxiety.

Once when she lost she bit her lips so deeply that a speck of blood tinged her handkerchief.
The next instant she was clutching her winnings with almost the ferocity of a hungry animal.
Then she leaned back a moment later exhausted in her chair, her face thrown up, her eyes closing
wearily.

 That beneath and through it all I felt the vibrations
of all the tragic things that come to men and women in their lives. Scenes from out an irrelevant
past swept across my mind. I heard again the long winding note of the bugle echoing through
the pines, the dead in uneven rows, the moon lighting their faces. I caught once more the cry
of the girl my friend loved, he who died and never knew. I saw the quick plunge of the strong
swimmer, white arms clinging to his neck, and heard once more that joyous shout from a hundred
throats. And I could still hear the hoarse voice of the captain with drenched book and flickering
lantern, and shivered again as I caught the dull splash of the sheeted body dropping into the sea.

The vox humana stopped, not gradually, but abruptly, as if the heart had broken and its life
had gone out in the one supreme effort. Then silence,--a silence so profound that a low sob
from the pew across the aisle startled me. I strained my eyes, and caught the outlines of a
woman heavily veiled. I could see, too, a child beside her, his head on her shoulder. The boy
was bare-headed, his curls splashed over her black dress. Then another sob, half smothered,
as if the woman were strangling.

No other sound broke the stillness; only the feeling everywhere of pent-up, smothered sighs.

In this intense moment a faint footfall was heard approaching from the church door, walking
in the gloom. It proved to be that of an old man, bent and trembling. He came slowly down the
sombre church, with unsteady, shambling gait, holding in one hand a burning taper,--a mere
speck. In the other he carried a rude lantern, its wavering light hovering about his feet.
As he passed in his long brown cloak, the swaying light encircled his white beard and hair
with a fluffy halo. He moved slowly, the spark he carried no larger than a firefly. The sacristan
had come to light the candles.

He stopped half way down the middle aisle, opposite a pew, the faint flush of his lantern falling
on the nearest upturned face. A long thin candle was fastened to this pew. The firefly of a
taper, held aloft in his trembling hand, flickered uncertainly like a moth, and rested on the
top of this candle. What need to slay them today? Have sympathy, ma, for the sure-and it is small for

will be done. Go again, ma, to a flood presently. Force and ox are

The woman in the pew across the aisle bent forward, resting her head on the back of the seat
in front, drawing the child to her. Old he cried, might so abruptly that they leap: "convey the homo that
was bound!"

A scuffle and a call were followed
by the appearance to a vaccinator, quaking of fear, bound hand and foot, as
the Bhils were with then were habituate of rise their homo act. The sacristan appeared again from behind the altar,
and walked slowly down the side aisle, carrying only his lantern. How did Hitchcock-"" You are

As he stood still, the woman drew suddenly back as if stunned by a blow, clutched the boy to
her side, and fixed her eyes on the lantern's ghostly shadows. I leaned over quickly. The glow
of the rude lamp, with its squares of waving light flecking the stone flagging, traced in unmistakable
outlines the form of a cross!
