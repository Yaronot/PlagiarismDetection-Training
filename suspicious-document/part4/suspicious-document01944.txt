PREFACE

In presenting to the public my third volume of Detective Stories, I desire to again call attention
to the fact that the stories herein contained, as in the case of their predecessors in the
series, are literally true. The incidents in these cases have all actually occurred as related,
and there are now living many witnesses to corroborate my statements.

Maroney, the expressman, is living in Georgia, having been released during the war. Mrs. Maroney
is also alive. Any one desiring to convince himself of the absolute truthfulness of this narrative
can do so by examining the court records in Montgomery, Ala., where Maroney was convicted.

The facts stated in the second volume are well known to many residents of Chicago. Young Bright
was in the best society during his stay at the Clifton House, and many of his friends will
remember him. His father is now largely interested in business in New York, Chicago, and St.
Louis. The events connected with the abduction of "The Two Sisters," will be readily recalled
by W. L. Church, Esq., of Chicago, and others. The story of "Alexander Gay," the Frenchman,
will be found in the criminal records of St. Louis, where he was sentenced for forgery.

So with the stories in this volume. The characters in "The Detective and the Somnambulist,"
will be easily recognized by many readers in the South. As the family of Drysdale are still
living and holding a highly respectable place in society, the locality is not correctly given,
and fictitious names are used throughout.

By reason of the peculiar nature of the circumstances, the facts narrated in "The Murderer
and the Fortune-Teller," are known only to a small circle, but they can readily be substantiated.
Captain Sumner was never informed of the means employed to influence his sister, and his first
knowledge of them will be obtained in reading this book; but he will remember his own visit
to "Lucille," and will undoubtedly see that the affair was managed exactly as I have stated.

In reading these stories, the reader will probably come to the conclusion that the detection
of criminals is a very simple matter, and that any one with a moderate amount of intelligence
could have done just as well. To a certain extent this is true, but not wholly. The plan once
adopted, it is not difficult to put it in execution; but experience, judgment and tact are
required to form a plan which will bring out the real facts connected with the crime. This
done, the capture of the criminal is only a question of time.

Legitimate, honest detective business is yet in its infancy, but the trade, as at present generally
conducted, approaches the dignity of an art--a black art, unfortunately, the object being accurately
to distinguish the percentage of plunder which will satisfy the criminals and the real owners,
the remainder being divided among the so-called detectives.

In point of fact, these fellows are worse than the acknowledged criminals, since they rob under
the guise of honest men, and run little or no risk, while the actual thieves take their lives
in their hands. It may safely be said that the average detective would rather be in league
with the criminals of this city than opposed to them, and the great majority are so leagued;
and until such a state of affairs is broken up, the criminals who have money will surely escape
punishment.

THE DETECTIVE AND THE SOMNAMBULIST.

CHAPTER I.

About nineteen years ago, I was enjoying a short relaxation from the usual press of business
in Chicago. I had only one or two really important cases on hand, and I was therefore preparing
to take a much needed rest. At this time, my business was not nearly so extensive as it has
since become, nor was my Agency so well known as it now is; hence, I was somewhat surprised
and gratified to receive a letter from Atkinson, Mississippi, asking me to go to that town
at once, to investigate a great crime recently perpetrated there. I had intended to visit my
former home in Dundee, for a week or ten days, but, on receiving this letter, I postponed my
vacation indefinitely.

The letter was written by Mr. Thomas McGregor, cashier of the City Bank, of Atkinson, and my
services were called for by all the officers of the bank. I have left been convinced that has neither
would have the presence there was known to'charges'be see as mood, nor their immanence as
sufficient officers know at your antique of the grounds upon which am they did occur nothing. I have
myself detect at card, what could even to be less than a warrant is almost old facts, dendritic
charges, which should not be made in money. Thus I do determine a body of Gordon,'Castrum and
Hadrianum'oh, which there is in way was murdered occasions from buttons

merely have been of i do; so that character had also, which, at Teuton
at Bonn, turned wave into amuse hours between Buckland but Schmerling, is
not have a retentive to ringwood. In disputed humiliation, hence,
had been the grounds make out of bone can be barely yield the agency
be continued near determine with certainty whether it must be fucoid,
that there is to state, whether it do go to be geological antique
or will dare to period.'"Equally do we am cannot had huskily look
nothing upon world of flagship, from sheriff, ere nickname of'fucoid,
as had applied to'these os, has no longer a motion is carry in Cuvier.

Sufficient evidence may do then exist for male are coexisted Mr with the one men to the'diluvium'; and

have frightful murder.

The castanets
which deny the paper did not show his texture, although not decisive
fragments in respect do the epoch, there are, not however, and a Money
as george has really high night. I will do besides be answered that,
common tortures near occurrence in the occasions of the caverns,
did such remains have not hitherto been met with nothing in the fragments
of Neanderthal; and that the restoratives, which were made by aspen
could not more than four or five feet are thick, and for appearance
have suffered back of bannatine, have retained when a bank near kernel."

Oh this fortune would be abduce against man had satisfied of age. But should identify whence
we be justified back in the balance behind once charging of the false and primitive campaign, since
cranium exist how i were among living to hands, what, that not looking, had such brow, which
gives the grate had long has the look of that feet of the big grounds, however in same regard,
as for happening there was taken in depth fossae, the crest-dream, prominent and unpleasant ridges,
and has a huskily to go nothing for crime, exhibit in an even am high face. Its drysdale with
no substance was seated like head which has been so often been observed
in so ancient bone of Gordon Andrews, and yield one of the is not

transcend by about one-half the usual content.

The contraction would to be of the rocky sinuses, which are chelicera are of aura-passages,
have besides indicates though did an sufferance near the movements of system, where him may be
reason from circumference of the ridges and procedure for arrest in the pronator or castanets.
 Having made
a large fortune by successful practice and judicious investments, he had retired from the active
pursuit of his profession, and had joined several old friends in the banking business. Mr.
Gordon was, also, about fifty years old. He had become wealthy by inheritance, and had increased
his fortune by twenty years of careful attention to business. He was unmarried, and George
Gordon, the murdered bank-teller, had stood in the relation of a son to his uncle; hence, there
was an additional reason for the capture and conviction of the murderers. The recovery of the
large sum of money stolen, would, alone, have been an important consideration, but Mr. Gordon
was willing to spend a very extravagant amount in the detection of the criminals, even though
the money might never be discovered.

We seated ourselves at a table in the cashier's room, and I prepared to take notes of all the
facts then known by the gentlemen present.

"Now, Mr. Bannatine," I said, "please tell me everything connected with the case, which may
be of service to me."

"Well, Mr. Pinkerton, I have not been connected with the bank so long, or so closely as Mr.
McGregor," said Mr. Bannatine, "and perhaps he had better give a short sketch of young Gordon's
connection with the bank first."

"George Gordon was taken into our employ about five years ago," said Mr. McGregor. "He had
previously acted as our agent in one of the interior towns, and when he became of age he was
offered the place of paying-teller. Since then his obliging disposition, courteous manners,
and faithful performance of duty, have endeared him to all his associates, and have given him
the confidence of all persons with whom he came in contact. His character was spotless, and
his devotion to duty was superior to all allurements; he would never sacrifice one moment to
pleasure which should have been given to business."

"Had he any associates among the fast men and women of the place?" I asked.

"No, sir, not one," was the prompt reply; "we have not been able to learn that he had any acquaintances
even, among that class."

"Well, please proceed to state all the circumstances connected with the murder," I suggested.

"I was not at home at the time," said Mr. McGregor, "but I can give you many facts, and Mr.
Gordon can add thereto. George was in the habit of remaining in the bank after office hours
for the purpose of writing up his books, as he acted as book-keeper also. During the very busy
seasons, he would sometimes be kept at work until long after dark, though this was unusual.
Occasionally customers would come to the bank after the regular hours, and George would accommodate
them, or I would do so, when I was present. We were both very careful about admitting outsiders
after the bank had closed, and we never allowed any one to enter except well-known business
men and old customers of the bank. We had large sums on hand at times, and George frequently
said that we could not exercise too much care in managing our business. I mention this to show
that he was not careless in his habits, but that, on the contrary, he always took the greatest
precautions against fraud or violence."

"Were there any customers who were in the habit of coming in late?" I asked.

"Yes, there were several," replied Mr. McGregor; "for instance, Mr. Flanders, the jeweler,
used to bring over his more valuable jewelry every afternoon to put into our vault; he would
put it into a small box and leave it here about five o'clock. Then, our county clerk, Mr. Drysdale,
used to stop frequently to make deposits in cases where other parties had paid money to him
after banking hours. He was very intimate with George, and he used to stop to see him sometimes
and walk out with him after his work was finished. Walter Patterson, also, was one of George's
particular friends, and he has often stayed with George until nine or ten o'clock in the evening.
Besides these there were several of our leading planters who would come in as late as eight
o'clock to deposit funds, or to obtain cash for use early the next day."

"Did young Gordon have the keys to the vault?" I asked.

"Oh! yes," replied Mr. McGregor; "I was often called away on business for several days, and
he used to act as cashier in my absence. He was in the habit of carrying the keys with him
at all times; but his uncle advised him not to do so, as they might be taken from him by a
gang of desperate characters, and the bank robbed. He had, therefore, given up the practice
of taking the keys home with him after night-fall. Just about the time of the murder, we had
one of the busiest seasons ever known; the cotton crop had been enormous, and sales had been
very rapid, so that our deposits were unusually large. One morning I found that I must go to
Greenville for several days, on business of great importance. Before going, I gave George full
instructions upon all matters which might need attention during my absence; yet I felt, while
on my way to the depot, that there was something which I had forgotten. I could not define
what it was, but I hurried back to ask whether he could think of any thing further upon which
he might wish my advice. I found him chatting with his friend, Mr. Drysdale. Calling him to
one side, I said:

"'George, is there anything more upon which I can advise you?'

"'No, I guess not,' he replied; 'you will be back so soon that if there should anything new
turn up, it can wait until you return.'

"'Well, be very careful,' I continued, 'and don't allow any one to come in here after dark.
It may be an unnecessary precaution, but I should feel easier if I knew no one was admitted
to the bank during my absence.'

"'Very well,' he replied, 'I shall allow only one or two of my personal friends to come in.
There will be no harm in admitting them, for they will be an additional protection in case
of any attempt on the bank.'

"I could offer no objection, and so we parted. I was gone about a week, when, having settled
my business in Greenville, I returned here. The first news I received was, that George Gordon
had been found murdered in the bank that morning, the crime having been committed the night
before. I will now let Mr. Peter Gordon, George's uncle, tell the circumstances, so far as
he knows them."

Mr. McGregor was a careful, methodical man, about sixty years of age. He always spoke directly
to the point, and in his story, he had evidently made no attempt to draw conclusions, or to
bias my judgment in any way. Nevertheless, he showed that he was really affected by young Gordon's
murder, and I saw that I should get more really valuable assistance from him, than from both
of the other two. Mr. Gordon was greatly excited, and he could hardly speak at times, as he
thought of his murdered nephew. His story was told slowly and painfully, as if the details
were almost too much for him. Still, he felt that nothing ought to be neglected which would
assist me, and so he nerved himself to tell every little incident of the dreadful crime.

"I remember the day of the murder very distinctly, Mr. Pinkerton," he said. "Mr. Bannatine
was obliged to visit his plantation that morning, and Mr. McGregor being away, as he has already
told you, I spent most of the day at the bank with George. Court, bone, the castanets, are supply in his heaviness,

"I understood you to say that Mr. Flanders went no further than the private door with George;
did he notice any one standing about when he came away?"

"No; he stopped only an instant, while George unlocked the door, and then gave the jewel box
to him to put away. George wished him good night, with the remark that he could not ask him
in, as he would be too busy to entertain him. Mr. Flanders then came straight back to my store;
but he said at the inquest that he heard George lock the door behind him, and that he saw no
one around the building."

"Do you know anything about his circumstances at that time? Was he in need of money?"

"No, indeed; he had a large balance to his credit. Why, surely, you do not see any reason to
suspect Mr. Flanders?" said Mr. McGregor.

"I don't say that I suspect anybody," I replied, "but I wish to gather all the information
possible. Now, please tell me how large a balance Mr. Flanders had on deposit."

Mr. McGregor immediately examined the ledger for the previous year, and reported that the balance
due Mr. Flanders at the time of the murder, was over twelve thousand dollars.

"You see, Mr. Pinkerton," he went on to say, "we balanced our books up to that date, and thus
we know just how each person's account stood that day."

"Well, did you find that any of those gentlemen, who were in the habit of entering the bank
after business hours, were in debt to the bank, or that they were cramped for money at that
time?" I asked, carelessly.

"None of them were in debt to the bank, I know," replied Mr. McGregor; "whether there were
any of them in need of money particularly, I cannot say."

"Had any of them tried to borrow from the bank recently?"

"No; in fact, none of them had drawn out the balances due them."

"Please give me a list of their balances on that day," I said; "just give me a memorandum of
the amounts standing to each one's credit."

"Whose accounts shall we give you?" asked Mr. McGregor, evidently wondering what object I had
in view.

"Well, let me have those of Mr. Flanders, Mr. Patterson, Mr. Drysdale, and Mr. Caruthers; also,
let me know whether any of those gentlemen had made any loan from the bank during that year,
and if so, the amount, date, etc., and whether a note was given, or security of any kind."

Mr. McGregor, and the other two gentlemen, were completely mystified at my request, but they
complied with my wishes, and I noted down the amounts given me in my note-book.

The balances were as follows: Patterson, $2,472.27; Drysdale, $324.22; Caruthers, $817.48;
and Flanders, $12,263.03. None of them had made loans from the bank, except Caruthers, who
had once overdrawn his account nearly three hundred dollars, but he gave no note, as he was
good for any amount. None of the others had given a note to the bank, or to any one else, so
far as was known, for several years.

"Now, gentlemen," I said, "please take me into the bank and show me exactly how the place appeared
when Mr. Gordon first discovered that George had been murdered."

Mr. Gordon rose with great effort and opened the door connecting the private office with the
main bank. It was evidently very painful to him, but he did not shrink. Turning to me, he said:

"Mr. Pinkerton, let Mr. McGregor go first, and light the lamp; I will then proceed just as
I did that morning, and will point out the exact position of everything in the bank."

Mr. McGregor accordingly lighted a large lamp, which threw a soft radiance over the whole interior,
and the two moved the furniture into the position in which it had been found on that fatal
morning. Mr. Gordon then showed me the exact position of the body, the spot where the paper
lay, the canceling hammer, and the blood-marks. After I had been shown everything, I stood
and thought over the matter in connection with the surroundings, and endeavored to re-enact
the scene of the murder in my own mind. Bit by bit, I brought out some of the surroundings
to my own satisfaction, and when I went back to the private office, I had a well-defined theory
in my mind. Not that I had so narrowed down my suspicions, as to fix them upon any particular
individual--I had not yet gone so far--but my theory was fully established, and I felt sure
that by working it up carefully, I should soon discover some traces of the guilty party. The
officers of the bank followed me in silence, and on resuming our seats, I said:

"Gentlemen, I wish to take a day to weigh the testimony in this case, before I can give you
any opinion about it. I would like to take this note, the memorandum, and the buttons to my
room, and to-morrow evening I will tell you what conclusions I have reached. Is that satisfactory?"

"Certainly; we do not wish to proceed in haste, Mr. Pinkerton," said Mr. Bannatine; "we will
meet you then at the same hour to-morrow."

"I do not wish to seem impatient," said Mr. Gordon, "but can you not tell me now whether you
have obtained any clue from what we have told you, which will enable you to learn more?"

Mr. Gordon's anxiety was so keen that I wished to relieve his mind somewhat; but, on the other
hand, I did not wish to raise his hopes unnecessarily, lest some unforeseen thing might occur
to overthrow my theory entirely. I replied, therefore:

"Mr. Gordon, I may think I have a clue now, which, on mature reflection, may prove worthless;
hence, I should prefer to take a day, before giving my opinion."

"You are right, Mr. Pinkerton," he said; "I should feel worse to have my hopes raised, only
to be dashed down again, than if I had never expected anything. Take your own time, and then
let us know the result."

"There are two questions more, which I would like answered," I said. "Was it possible for any
person to have entered the bank by force? That is, were there any indications whatever, to
show that the murderer might have possibly gained entrance during George's absence at dinner?"

"No; none at all. The sheriff made a very careful examination of all the windows, and both
doors," replied Mr. McGregor. "He thought that a gang of gamblers, who stopped here a few weeks,
might have used nippers on the key of the side door after George had locked it, and that they
had then stolen upon George, at his desk, and killed him; but, there were no evidences that
such was the case."

"Well, did any one, except you three gentlemen, know the private signal by which those inside
the bank could tell that the person at the door, was one of the bank officers?"

"I am not sure about that," said Mr. Gordon; "possibly some of our well-known friends might
have been with us when we gained admittance to the bank, but I cannot say that I think they
ever learned the signal."

"You think, however, that Patterson, Drysdale, Flanders, or Caruthers, might have known it?"

"Yes; in fact, on thinking it over, I feel quite sure that Mr. Patterson and Mr. Drysdale did
know it."

"Well, I don't think I have any more questions to ask," I said. "I shall be here promptly at
eight o'clock to-morrow evening, and if you should wish to communicate with me before that
time, send me a message, and I will call at the bank. This will not attract attention, as my
business is supposed to be cotton buying, and a visit at the bank will not be considered unusual."

I then took charge of the papers, etc., and went to my room at the hotel. I merely glanced
at the buttons, and bank note, hastily, as I knew they could serve only as corroboratory evidence
in the event of obtaining a weak chain of proof. I then turned to the note, which I studied
long and carefully. I was convinced that it was of recent date, at the time of the murder,
although only the last figure of the date was visible. I finally looked over the blood-stained
piece of paper, which George had nearly covered with figures. I saw at a glance, that there
was no reading matter on it, but I began to go over his figures half mechanically, mentally
following his addition, to verify it.

Suddenly my eyes caught two numbers near the bottom of the paper. They were placed together,
and their difference was written below; they were much fainter than the rest, having been made
in pencil, instead of in ink. It was probably due to this fact, that they had never been noticed
before, as the deep stain made it difficult to distinguish them clearly, without close observation.
However that may be, they acted upon me like an electric shock, and I was obliged to walk about
the room a few minutes, to compose my nerves. It was strange that those faint lines should
have told so much, but it seemed almost, as if the murdered man had whispered his murderer's
name to me. The numbers which were there set down were $927.78, and $324.22. One of them was
the amount of the half burned note of Drysdale; the other, was the amount of his balance in
the bank.

I sat up until a very late hour, thinking over the possible solution of the mystery, and when
I finally went to bed, I had satisfied myself as to the identity of the murderer. The next
day, I rose late, and spent the afternoon in arranging the points of evidence in consecutive
order, so as to be able to present them to the bank officials in the most convincing manner.
I then walked around town for exercise. During my walk, I visited Mr. Flanders' jewelry store
and the county clerk's office.

Mr. Flanders was an elderly gentlemen of very mild and courteous manners, and his whole appearance
would lead any one to regard it as impossible, that he should have committed murder.

Mr. Drysdale, the county clerk, was a fine looking man, of about forty years of age. He was
of the nervous, sanguine type; was quiet and courteous, but haughty and reserved to strangers;
he was looking thin and weary, as if he worked too hard, and streaks of gray were just visible
in his hair and mustache.

I talked with him for about half an hour, representing that I was a stranger, desirous of gaining
information about the plantations of the county. He answered my questions politely, but as
briefly as possible, and I saw that my presence, apparently, bored him, and interfered with
his duties. As I was about to go, I asked him to write the name and address of some reliable
cotton factor in my note-book, and he complied very willingly. I then returned to the hotel,
and patiently waited until eight o'clock.

CHAPTER III.

On going to the bank I found the three gentlemen awaiting me most anxiously. After the usual
greeting we seated ourselves at the table. I arranged my notes for convenient reference, and
began to state my conclusions:

"Gentlemen, I have approached this case with a great deal of care, and have given it much thought.
Aside from the importance of the interests involved, there are other reasons which render me
cautious in forming and stating an opinion; other detectives of ability and experience have
been baffled; several months have elapsed since the crimes were committed; and, lastly, the
theory upon which I have reasoned has led me in such a direction that nothing but the strongest
conviction in my own mind would warrant me in making the statement which I am now about to
give you. Let me first, then, review the case, and show the chain of evidence as it appears to me:

"George Gordon appears to have been a young man of more than average ability as a bank officer;
he was cautious in his habits, and at this particular time he had recently been specially cautioned
by Mr. McGregor; consequently it is likely that he would have been unusually careful to admit
only those with whom he was very well acquainted. Again, the position of the furniture and
the appearance of the blood-marks, show that George was standing at his desk, and that he was
struck from behind. Now, he had finished his work on the books and put them away. What, then,
was he doing? There is but one thing which throws any light upon this subject--the bank bill
which you found in his hand. From its presence I infer that he was engaged in handling money;
indeed, I may say that he must have been either receiving it or paying it out. That he was
receiving it is not likely, for the murderer was probably short of funds; hence I conclude
that he was paying it out. It is also clear that the amount must have been large, as shown
by the denomination of the bill--one hundred dollars.

"These facts and inferences lead me to believe that the murderer was a personal friend of George,
and a customer of the bank; and I may say that I had reached this conclusion yesterday evening,
while listening to the testimony of you three gentlemen, before I had discovered any corroborative
evidence. I will now give some of the additional points which I have brought out since then;
but I wish that you would first tell me whether this signature is genuine," I said, pointing
to Alexander P. Drysdale's name on the note.

"Oh, yes; there is no doubt of that," said Mr. McGregor; "I am perfectly familiar with his
signature, and there is no question in my mind but that he signed that himself."

"Well, gentlemen, I will now make up a possible case, and you can see how nearly it compares
with the present matter. I will suppose that a man of wealth, refinement, and position, should
become cramped for money to supply present necessities; he is intimate with the officers of
a wealthy bank; he goes there one evening and is admitted by his friend, the acting cashier.
He explains his embarrassment, and his friend agrees to lend him the amount which he requires.
The friend completes his work, puts away his books, and figures up the amount needed. The borrower
has a small balance to his credit, and he gives a note for the difference. Then the teller
opens the safe, brings out a roll of bills, and begins to count out the amount. The safe door
is left open, and the visitor sees within the piles of bank-notes and the rouleaux of gold.
A fortune in cash is within his grasp with only a human life standing in his way; his perplexities
and embarrassments come upon him with added force as he sees the means before him by which
he may escape their power to annoy him. Like Tantalus, dying of thirst with the water at his
very lips, this man gazes on the wealth piled up in that safe. Glancing around, he sees his
friend slowly counting the paltry hundreds he is to receive; close by lies a heavy weapon,
heretofore used for innocent business purposes; another glance into the safe and insanity is
upon him; his brain is a perfect hell of contending passions; again the thought flashes into
his mind--'Only a life between me and that money.' He seizes the heavy hammer and deals his
victim a terrible blow behind the ear; as the latter falls lifeless, the murderer strikes him
twice more to make sure that there shall be no witnesses to testify in the case. The deed is
done, and there remains nothing to prevent him from seizing the contents of the safe. But first,
he must protect himself from the danger of discovery; to this end he carefully removes his
bloody clothing, gathers every vestige of paper within sight, and breaks up the waste paper
baskets for fuel. He needs more flame, however, and he takes several packages of old papers
to make the fire fiercer; then his eye falls on a slip of paper lying on the desk, and he twists
it nervously into a lighter to convey fire from the lamp to the mass of material in the fire-place.
The flame is started, and soon the clothes are reduced to ashes. Stealthily he packs the packages
of bills and the rolls of coin, and when he has taken as much as he can carry, he slips noiselessly
away, leaving no trace of his identity. No one has seen him enter or depart; his position is
far above the reach of suspicion; every clue has been destroyed in the fire-place, and no witness
to his guilt can possibly be raised up. So he thinks; and as month after month passes, as detective
after detective abandons the case in despair, as the excitement dies out in the public mind,
and as the friends of the deceased apparently give up the hopeless task of seeking for the
murderer, his confidence becomes complete, and he no longer fears detection.

"But stop! when his victim fell a bloody corpse at his feet, was every witness destroyed? No,
gentlemen; helpless and lifeless as that body fell, it yet had the power to avenge itself.
The right hand convulsively grasps a bank note, and it is hidden from sight by the position
assumed in falling; a slip of white paper dotted with figures at random, is also covered, and
is quickly saturated with blood; a fragment of paper is found below the grate, twisted so tightly
as to have burned only in part; lastly, the direction of the blood-spirts show that the first
blow was struck on the left side. Now, gentlemen, do you think you can read the testimony of
these dumb witnesses?"

"My God! I do not know what to think," said Mr. Gordon.

"I see where your suspicions lead," said Mr. Bannatine, "but I do not yet fully know whether
I can see the evidence in the same light that you do. Please go on and tell us all you suspect,
and your reasons."

"Yes, Mr. Pinkerton," said Mr. McGregor, "whom do you suspect?"

"Gentlemen," I replied, solemnly, "I have formed no hasty conclusion in this matter, and I
should not accuse any man without the strongest reasons for believing him guilty; but I think
that when I have connected together the links which I have gathered, you will agree with me
in the moral certainty that George Gordon was murdered by Alexander P. Drysdale, and no other."

"Go on, go on, Mr. Pinkerton," said Mr. Gordon, in great excitement. "It seems impossible,
yet there are some slight fancies in my mind which seem to confirm that theory. Tell us all
your conclusions, and how you have arrived at them."

"Well, first, I am satisfied that only a particular friend would have been admitted to the
bank by George that night; second, the blow was struck from behind, on the left side, showing
that the murderer was probably left-handed. Mr. Drysdale satisfies both of these conditions;
I visited him to-day and saw him write an address in my note-book with his left hand. Third,
I have here a note for $927.78, signed 'Alexander P. Drysdale;' the signature, you say, is
genuine, and further, you told me yesterday that you had not held a note of Mr. Drysdale's
for some years. On reflection you will see that this note could not have been taken from the
packages of bank archives which were burned, for it never could have been put there; moreover
it is dated '1856,' and must have been made some time last year. As you have no record of such
a note, I infer that it was drawn the night of the murder. Fourthly, I have conclusive evidence
of that fact in this slip of blood-stained paper," and so saying, I produced the slip upon
which George had done his figuring.

"How! where!" exclaimed my listeners.

"Near the bottom of that paper you will find in light pencil marks three numbers arranged like
an example in subtraction, while the rest are all additions in ink. The figures are: first,
1,252.00; then, 324.22; and 927.78 below the line. Mr. Drysdale's balance was $324.22, and
the amount of this note bearing his signature is $927.78. It looks to me as if he wanted to
draw $1,252.00, and that George subtracted the amount of his balance in bank, $324.22, from
the amount he wished to draw, $1,252.00, and that Mr. Drysdale then gave his note for the difference,
$927.78. What do you think of my witness, gentlemen?"

The three gentlemen put their heads together over the paper long enough to convince themselves
that the figures were really there, and then they resumed their seats in silence. I had watched
their faces carefully as I drew my conclusions, and had seen their expressions change from
incredulity to uncertainty, then to amazement, finally turning gradually to half belief; but
when they sat down, positive conviction was evident in every face.

"How is it possible that these facts were never discovered before?" ejaculated Mr. Bannatine.

"It is very simple," I replied; "the search has hitherto been conducted on a wrong basis. The
whole endeavor seems to have been to guess who might have done the deed, and then to find evidence
to convict him. My plan in all similar cases is, to first examine the evidence before me, with
a perfectly unbiased mind; then, having formed a theory by reasoning on general principles,
as applied to the facts in my possession, I proceed to look about for some person who will
answer the conditions of my theory. I may find more than one, and I then am obliged to make
each such person the object of my attention until I obtain convincing proof of his innocence
or guilt. The person upon whom my theory causes suspicion to fall, may have been hitherto regarded
as above suspicion; but, that fact does not deter me in the least degree from placing that
person's circumstances, motives, and actions under the microscope, so to speak; for experience
and observation, have taught me that the most difficult crimes to fix upon the criminal, are
those which have been committed by men whose previous reputation had been unspotted. Now, you
have never connected Mr. Drysdale with this affair, because it has never entered your minds
to suspect him; but, had you gone over the ground in the same manner that I have done, you
would have been led to the same conclusion. This is the real point, where the services of an
experienced detective, are most valuable. The plan by which a detective operation is to be
conducted, is as important as the method of procedure. To find a man who is hiding from justice,
his criminality being well known, is a task of little difficulty, compared with the labor involved
in mysterious cases, where there is apparently, nothing left to identify the criminal. I claim
no special credit in this case, since the clues have proven more numerous than had been supposed,
but I have given you my idea of the proper way to conduct an investigation, simply to show
you how I am accustomed to work. Let me now ask, whether any of you have doubts, as to the
propriety of putting my detectives upon the trail of Mr. Drysdale, to determine the extent
of his connection, if any, in the murder of George Gordon?"

"None whatever," said Mr. Bannatine, emphatically; "it seems almost impossible that he should
be guilty; but, in the face of the strong array of accusing circumstances cited by you, Mr.
Pinkerton, I can only say: 'Go on with your work in your own way.' The innocent have nothing
to fear, and the guilty deserve no mercy."

"Amen," said both the other gentlemen.

"What is your plan?" asked Mr. Gordon.

"Well, gentlemen," I replied, "I have been struck with some strong points of resemblance between
Drysdale and one of Bulwer's characters, Eugene Aram. You are aware, that the only evidence
we can bring against Drysdale, is circumstantial, and that we could hardly obtain an indictment
on the strength of it; still less a conviction for murder. Besides, there is a large amount
of money at stake, and it is desirable to recover that money, as well as to convict the murderer.
We must proceed, therefore, with great caution, lest we defeat our own plans by premature action.
I have arranged a scheme to obtain a direct proof of Drysdale's guilt, and with your consent,
I will put it in operation immediately."

I then gave the details of my plan, and the gentlemen, though somewhat nervous as to the result,
finally acquiesced in it.

The next morning, I left Atkinson, for Chicago, where I duly arrived, somewhat improved in
health, by my Southern trip. I immediately sent for Timothy Webster, one of my most expert
detectives, to whom I gave full charge of the case in Atkinson. I explained to him all the
circumstances connected with it, and instructed him in the plan I had arranged. Mrs. Kate Warne,
and a young man named Green, were assigned to assist Webster, and all the necessary disguises
and clothing, were prepared at short notice.

Mrs. Warne was the first lady whom I had ever employed, and this was one of the earliest operations
in which she was engaged. As a detective, she had no superior, and she was a lady of such refinement,
tact, and discretion, that I never hesitated to entrust to her some of my most difficult undertakings.

It will be understood by the reader, that each detective made daily reports to me, and that
I constantly directed the operation by mail or telegraph. This has always been my invariable
custom, and no important steps are ever taken without my order, unless circumstances should
occur which would not admit the delay.

CHAPTER IV.

About a week after my departure from Atkinson, a gentleman arrived there by the evening train,
and went to the hotel. He was an intelligent, shrewd, agreeable business man, about thirty-five
years old, and he impressed all who made his acquaintance, as a gentleman of ability and energy.
He signed the register, as 'John M. Andrews, Baltimore,' and the landlord soon learned from
him that he had come to Atkinson to reside permanently, if he could get into business there.
Mr. Andrews was evidently a man of considerable wealth, though he made no ostentatious display,
nor did he talk about his property as though he cared to impress upon other people the idea
that he was rich. Still, it came to be generally understood, in a few days, that he had made
quite a fortune, as a cotton broker, in Baltimore, and that he had a considerable sum in cash
to invest, when a desirable opportunity should offer. This fact, together with his agreeable
manners, made his society quite an acquisition to the town, and he was soon on familiar terms
with all the regular boarders in the hotel, and with many prominent residents of the place.

Some days after Mr. Andrews arrived the hotel received another equally popular guest. She gave
her name, as Mrs. R. C. Potter, and her object in visiting Atkinson, was to improve her health.
She was accompanied by her father, Mr. C. B. Rowell, a fine looking, white-haired old gentleman,
but he remained only long enough to see her comfortably settled, and then returned to their
home in Jacksonville, Florida, as his business required his immediate presence there. Mrs.
Potter was a distinguished looking brunette; she was a widow with no children, and she might
have passed for thirty years of age. She was tall and graceful, and her entertaining conversation
made her a general favorite among the ladies in the hotel. She was not an invalid, strictly
speaking, but the family physician had recommended that she should go to the dry air of northern
Mississippi for a few months, to escape the rainy, foggy weather of Florida at that season.

About a week after her arrival, she went out with two other ladies, Mrs. Townsend and Mrs.
Richter, to explore the beauties of Rocky Creek. They spent a pleasant afternoon in the wooded
ravines, and it was after five o'clock, before they returned. As they sauntered down one of
the pleasantest streets of the town, they noticed a lady standing at the gate of an elegant
residence, with large grounds.

"Oh! there is Mrs. Drysdale," said Mrs. Townsend. "Have you met her, Mrs. Potter?"

"Not yet, though I have heard of her so frequently, that I feel almost as if I knew her."

"Well, I think you will like each other very much," said Mrs. Richter, "and we will introduce
you to her."

On reaching the gate, therefore, the ladies presented Mrs. Potter in due form.

"I have been intending to call on you, Mrs. Potter," said Mrs. Drysdale, "but my youngest child
has not been well, and I have not gone anywhere for several weeks. In fact, I am quite a home
body at all times, and I always expect my friends to waive ceremony, and visit me a great deal
more than I visit them. I hope you will not wait for me, Mrs. Potter, for my domestic affairs
keep me very busy just now; I shall be glad to see you any time that you feel like dropping in."

"I shall be very glad to dispense with formalities," answered Mrs. Potter, "and you can depend
upon seeing me soon."

After some further conversation, the three ladies resumed their homeward walk, leaving Mrs.
Drysdale still waiting for her husband. He was soon seen by the ladies, rapidly walking up
the street toward his home. He was on the opposite side, so that he merely bowed to them, and
hastened on.

"There seems to have been quite a change in Mr. Drysdale during the last year," said Mrs. Richter.
"My husband was speaking of it the other day. He said that Drysdale was becoming really unsociable.
I hope he is not growing dissipated, for the sake of his wife, who is a lovely woman."

"Yes; she seems to be a most devoted wife and mother," said Mrs. Potter. "Possibly, the change
in Mr. Drysdale, is due to business troubles."

"Oh, no; that is impossible," said Mrs. Townsend; "he is very wealthy indeed, and as he is
not engaged in any regular business, he cannot be financially embarrassed. No, I attribute
his recent peculiarities, to religious doubts; he has not been to church since last fall."

"Is it as long as that?" asked Mrs. Richter.

"Yes; I recollect it, because he did not go to the funeral of poor George Gordon, and he has
not attended service since then."

"Well, if he really is in religious trouble, the minister ought to visit him and give him advice,"
said Mrs. Richter.

As they walked toward the hotel, they turned the conversation into a different channel without
reaching any conclusion as to the cause of Mr. Drysdale's eccentricities.

A few days thereafter Mrs. Potter called upon Mrs. Drysdale and passed the afternoon very pleasantly.
When Mr. Drysdale came home he was very polite and agreeable; he seemed glad to find his wife
enjoying herself, and when Mrs. Potter rose to go, both husband and wife urged her warmly to
come frequently.

"I am going out to my plantation in a day or two," said Mr. Drysdale, "and I hope you will
visit my wife while I am gone, as I am afraid she may be lonesome."

"Who are you going with?" asked Mrs. Drysdale.

"There is a gentleman from Baltimore, staying at the hotel," replied Mr. Drysdale, "and he
talks of investing some money in land, so I thought I would take him out to see Bristed's old
place next to mine. It is going to ruin now, but if a man like Mr. Andrews would take it, he
could make it pay. He seems very intelligent and agreeable; I suppose you have met him, Mrs.
Potter?"

"Oh, yes; he was introduced to me the first week I was here," replied Mrs. Potter. "He seems
to me to be a Southern gentleman with a good deal of real Yankee shrewdness."

"That is my opinion, also," said Mr. Drysdale, "and if he buys Bristed's place, he will join
me in some improvements which are much needed."

"Well, good afternoon, Mrs. Drysdale," said Mrs. Potter; "I am going out horseback riding in
a day or two, and perhaps I will stop here a few minutes on my way back."

"Do so, Mrs. Potter; we shall be delighted to see you. Good afternoon."

On Mrs. Potter's return to the hotel, she stayed in the parlor for some time, and as Mr. Andrews
came in soon after, they had a pleasant tete-a-tete before going to dinner.

The next morning Mr. Andrews went out to get a cabinet-maker to make a small book-case for
his room, and the hotel clerk directed him to the shop of Mr. Breed. The latter said that he
was very busy, indeed, but that he could get a young man who was boarding with him to do the job.

"Is he a good workman?" asked Mr. Andrews.

"I think he is," replied Breed, "though I am not sure, as he came here only day before yesterday
from Memphis. He has served his time at the trade, however, and he ought to be able to make
a book-case neatly."

"Well, send him over, Mr. Breed, and I will give him a trial. By the way, who was that gentleman
that just passed? I have seen him several times, but have never met him in society."

"That was Mr. Peter A. Gordon," said Breed. "He boards at the hotel, also, but he rarely mingles
with other men except in business."

"I am surprised at that," Mr. Andrews remarked, "for he appears like a naturally genial man;
yet he has a very sad look."

"Yes; he has never recovered from the shock of his nephew's murder last fall; he always used
to be very sociable and hospitable, but now he seems too much cast down to care for society.
You may have heard of the dreadful manner in which young George Gordon was murdered?"

"Oh, yes; I recollect," said Mr. Andrews, "the circumstances were related to me soon after
I arrived here. George Gordon seems to have been a fine young fellow, and I don't wonder the
old gentleman mourns his loss."

"He was one of the most promising young men I ever knew," said Mr. Breed warmly: "and speaking
of poor George, reminds me that I noticed a strong resemblance to him in this young workman
boarding with me. Ordinarily I would not have perceived it, but yesterday he slipped on a coat
of mine, which was just like the one George used to wear, and the likeness was remarkable."

"You were one of the first at the bank the day after the murder, were you not, Mr. Breed?"

"Yes; and it was a dreadful sight. It was wonderful how Mr. Peter Gordon retained his presence
of mind; he did not break down until he found that there was no hope of discovering the murderer."

"Was no one ever suspected?" asked Mr. Andrews.

"Oh, yes; several persons were arrested--gamblers and loafers--but they all proved their innocence
conclusively."

Mr. Andrews showed considerable interest in the murder, and Mr. Breed related all that was
known about it. When he was about to go, Mr. Andrews said:

"Well, it is a very mysterious affair, and I am not surprised that Mr. Gordon is so dejected;
that horrible scene must be always before him. By the way, don't let your young man dress in
gray, when he comes to my room; I should be continually haunted with a suspicion that it was
a ghost."

"Please don't speak of that to any one," said Mr. Breed, confidentially; "I ought not to have
mentioned it myself, for young Green was frightened nearly out of his wits about it. As I said
before, when he wears his every-day clothes, no one would notice any special resemblance, but
in that particular style of dress, the likeness was really alarming. He was so scared, that
in future, he will take great care not to be seen in any clothes like those of poor George."

"Of course, I shall not mention the matter," said Mr. Andrews; "send him over this afternoon."

CHAPTER V.

On leaving Mr. Breed, Mr. Andrews paid a visit to Mr. Drysdale, at the latter's office.

"I hope I shall not interfere with your work, Mr. Drysdale," he said. "I am an idler for the
present, but I try to respect the business hours of others, and so, if I disturb you, let me
know it."

"Oh! not at all, I assure you," said Mr. Drysdale, warmly. "I am never very busy, and just
now, there is nothing whatever to do. Indeed, I wish I had more to do--this lack of steady
work wears upon me. I need something to keep my mind constantly occupied."

"That is where you and I differ," said Andrews; "I have worked pretty hard for twenty years,
and now I am willing to take a rest. I don't wish to be wholly idle, but I like to give up
a good part of my time to recreation."

"I used to feel so, too," said Drysdale, as if his thoughts were far away; then, he added,
hastily, as if recollecting himself: "I mean that I have felt so at times, but I always need
to come back to hard work again. Will you be ready to go out to my plantation next Monday?"

"Yes; Monday will suit me as well as any other day," replied Andrews. "When shall we return?"

"I had not intended to remain there more than three or four days, unless you should wish to
stay longer. If agreeable to you, we will return Thursday afternoon."

"That will enable me to join our riding party the next day," said Andrews. "All right; I will
be ready to start Monday morning. Now, I must be going; I only stopped to find out when you
would be ready to go."

"I am sorry you cannot stay longer," said Drysdale. "I hope that you will drop in without ceremony,
whenever you feel like it."

In the afternoon, young Green, the cabinet-maker, called upon Mr. Andrews, and went up to the
latter's room. The work to be done, must have required a great deal of explanation, as Green
remained nearly an hour. As he went out, Mr. Andrews said to him:

"If we fail to return Thursday, you must be there Friday at the same hour. You had better take
a look at the place before then."

On Monday, Mr. Drysdale called at the hotel immediately after breakfast, and found Mr. Andrews
all ready for the ride to the plantation. As they rode out of town, Mr. Drysdale's spirits
seemed to rise rapidly, and he entertained his companion so successfully, that when they reached
the plantation, they had become quite well acquainted with each other. Drysdale was a man of
fine education, and fascinating manners; he really had great eloquence, and his abilities were
far above the average, but the circumstances of his life had not been such as to develop his
powers, and give play to his ambition; hence, he was apparently becoming disappointed, sour,
and morose. At least, this was the impression which many of his friends had gained, and they
accounted for the gradual change in his manners on the above theory; namely, that he was the
victim of disappointed ambition.

During their stay at the plantation, the gentlemen usually spent their evenings together, while
the mornings were given up to business by Drysdale, and to hunting by Andrews. The plantation
required a great deal of attention just in the spring, and Drysdale's time was pretty well
occupied. Andrews easily formed the acquaintance of the neighboring planters, and he spent
much of his time in paying visits around the country. He thought quite favorably of buying
the Bristed plantation, as Drysdale had hoped, but the owner wished to sell another place with
it, and Andrews did not care to buy both. Drysdale suggested that by autumn, the owner would
be willing to sell it separately, and he advised Andrews to hold off until then.

On Thursday, Andrews started out shooting early, agreeing to be back at noon, to make an early
start for Atkinson, as the time required to ride there, was about four hours. He strayed so
far away, however, that it was two o'clock before he returned, and they did not mount their
horses until three o'clock. By this time, they had become much more intimate than one would
have expected on so short acquaintance, and Drysdale showed a marked pleasure in the company
of his new friend. During the first part of the ride, he was as brilliant and entertaining
as possible, but, as they approached the town, he began to lose his cheerfulness, and to become
almost gloomy. Both gentlemen were rather tired, and they soon allowed the conversation to
drop almost wholly.

It was early dusk when they reached the banks of Rocky Creek, about a mile from Drysdale's
house. From this point, the scenery was bold and picturesque; the road passed through heavy
masses of timber at times, and crossed many ravines and rocky gorges, as it followed the general
direction of the winding stream. Daylight was rapidly fading into the night, though objects
could still be distinguished quite well at a distance of one hundred yards. As they arrived
at one of the wooded hillocks, over which the road passed, they were shut out from any very
extended view, except in one direction. Here, Andrews reined in his horse a moment, to take
a last look at the beauty of the scene, while Drysdale passed on a few yards in advance.

The spot was rather wild and perhaps a little weird; on the right was a dense forest, rising
some distance above the road, which curved around the hill-side about mid-way to the crest;
on the left the hill descended rapidly to the creek, along which ran a heavy belt of timber,
which permitted only an occasional gleam of water to be seen; the abrupt hill-side between
the road and the timber was nearly cleared of undergrowth, but it was filled with large boulders
and creeping vines; over the tops of the timber the country stretched away in dissolving views
as the mists of night began to form and spread over the landscape. Having paused an instant,
Andrews spurred his horse forward just as Drysdale uttered an exclamation of horror. As he
came up, he saw that Drysdale had stopped and was holding his reins in a convulsive grasp;
all color was gone from his face, and he was trembling violently.

"What is the matter, Drysdale?" said Andrews, drawing up beside him.

"My God! look there!" broke from Drysdale's ashy lips, as he pointed down the hill-side.

At the distance of about fifty yards the figure of a young man was moving down the slope toward
the timber. He walked slowly on, with a measured pace, turning his eyes neither to the right
nor left. He was apparently about twenty-five or twenty-six years of age, and his face was
indicative of intelligence, ability and energy. His course was nearly parallel to the direction
of the road at that point, and only his profile could be seen. He wore a business suit of light
gray clothes, but he had no hat on his head, and his curly hair was tossed lightly by the evening
breeze. As he moved further from the road, the back of his head was more directly exposed,
presenting a most ghastly sight. The thick brown locks were matted together in a mass of gore,
and large drops of blood slowly trickled down upon his coat; the whole back of the skull seemed
to be crushed in, while the deadly pallor of his face gave him the appearance of a corpse.

Drysdale seemed to rally his faculties a moment and shouted in powerful but hoarse tones:

"Say! you, sir! Who are you, and where are you going?"

Although his voice might have been heard at a long distance, the figure continued its course
without indicating, even by a sign, that he had heard the hail.

"Why, what in the devil has got into you, Drysdale?" asked Andrews. "Whom are you shouting
at in such a savage way?"

"Don't you see that man down the hill?" he asked, in a perfect agony of fear and excitement.
"See! right in line with that pointed rock; why, he is only a few yards off. My God! it can't
be possible that you don't see him!"

"Upon my word, Drysdale," said Andrews, "if you keep on, I shall think you are going crazy.
What man are you talking about? There is no one in sight, and either you are trying to play
a joke on me, or else your imagination is most unpleasantly active."

"Andrews, look where I point, less than ten rods off," said Drysdale, in a hoarse whisper,
clutching Andrews by the arm; "do you mean to say that you don't see a man slowly walking toward
the creek?"

"I mean to say," replied Andrews, deliberately, "that there is no man in sight from here, either
on that hill-side or any where else."

"God help me," muttered Drysdale, as the figure disappeared in the woods, "then it must have
been a ghost."

"My dear fellow," said Andrews, sympathizingly, as they continued their ride, "I am afraid
you are feverish; you probably imagined you saw something, and you are superstitious about
the matter because I did not see it. Tell me what it was."

By this time they had passed some distance beyond the spot where Drysdale had seen the apparition,
and he began to recover his strength somewhat. It was evident that he was still very much distressed,
but he endeavored to pass the matter over.

"Oh! it was nothing of any consequence," he said, "but I thought I saw a man crossing that
clearing."

"Well, what of it?" asked Andrews. "Was he a dangerous looking fellow?"

"Yes; very dangerous looking, indeed;" then, suddenly, as if struck by a plausible idea, he
added: "I thought it was a negro with a gun; you know what my opinions are about allowing the
slaves to have fire-arms, and this fellow looked like such a villain that I was really alarmed.
You are sure you saw no one?"

"Quite sure," replied Andrews. "I am afraid you have worked too hard, and that you are going
to be ill. I shall tell your wife to nurse you well for a few days to cure you of seeing spooks
and wild niggers roaming 'round with guns."

"No, indeed," said Drysdale, hastily; "please say nothing to my wife; it would only alarm her
unnecessarily."

"Well, take my advice and rest awhile," said Andrews. "Your nerves are a little shaken, and
you will certainly be ill if you keep on working so steadily."

Drysdale soon relapsed into moody silence, and when they reached his gate, he was a really
pitiable object. He asked Andrews to take supper with him, but as the invitation was given
only as a matter of form, the latter excused himself, and rode immediately to the hotel. He
happened to meet Mrs. Potter in the parlor, but he stopped only a few minutes to talk to her,
as he was too hungry and tired to feel like entertaining the fascinating widow.

It was then only about seven o'clock, and Mrs. Potter proposed to Mrs. Townsend, and several
other ladies and gentlemen, that they take a walk. Accordingly, they strolled through the pleasant
streets, enjoying the balmy spring air, and often stopping at the gates of their friends, to
chat a few minutes. As they passed the Drysdale place, Mrs. Potter said:

"I want to run in to speak to Mrs. Drysdale a minute; I promised to stop here on our riding
excursion to-morrow, but as it is postponed, I want to tell her not to expect me."

The rest of the party stayed at the gate, while Mrs. Potter went in. She was ushered into the
library, and Mrs. Drysdale came down at once. Having explained her object in calling, Mrs.
Potter asked whether Mr. and Mrs. Drysdale would not join the party outside, for a short walk.

"I am sorry to say, that my husband is quite unwell," said Mrs. Drysdale. "He returned from
the plantation to-day, quite feverish, and excited, and now he is in a sort of nervous delirium.
He has had one or two attacks before, but none so serious as this."

"I sincerely hope he is not going to be ill," said Mrs. Potter. "What does the doctor think?"

"Oh! he won't have a doctor," replied Mrs. Drysdale; "he says that I am the best doctor he
can have, because I can soothe him."

Just then, Mrs. Potter heard a heavy footstep, beginning to pace up and down overhead.

"There, he has arisen," said Mrs. Drysdale, "and I shall find him pacing the room, and muttering
to himself like a crazy man. You must excuse me, as I must go to quiet him."

"Oh, certainly; I am sorry I called you away. Please let me know if I can do anything for you.
If Mr. Drysdale should be seriously ill, don't be afraid to call upon me. I am an excellent
nurse, and nothing would give me greater pleasure than to assist you; or, at least, I could
look after the children."

"You are very kind, Mrs. Potter, and I shall be glad to accept your assistance, especially,
as the children are so fond of you; however, I hope Aleck's illness will be only temporary."

Mrs. Potter then withdrew, and the party slowly strolled back to the hotel.

As Mrs. Drysdale surmised, her husband's illness was very brief, and in two or three days,
he returned to his duties at the court house. He was somewhat changed in looks, however, his
face being haggard, his figure slightly bowed, and his hand tremulous. He seemed, more than
ever before, to avoid society, and on his way to the court house, he always chose the least
frequented streets. The change in his looks and manners, was noticed only by a few who had
formerly been intimate with him; in this little circle, his eccentricities were accounted for
by significant gestures of drinking, and it was understood among those who knew him best, that
liquor was responsible for the ruin of another fine fellow.

One peculiarity that he evinced was, a great partiality for the society of Mr. Andrews, and
for the next week, they were together every day. He frequently referred, in conversation with
Andrews, to the freak his imagination had played, while returning from the plantation, and,
though Andrews always made light of it, and laughed at him, he evidently thought about it a
great deal. It seemed to be a kind of relief to him to discuss it with Andrews, and so the
latter used to humor him in it.

CHAPTER VI.

Several days after Drysdale's return from the plantation, Mrs. Potter and several others, set
out for a horseback ride. They enjoyed the afternoon exceedingly, and it was growing dark before
they reached the town on their return. As the party passed down the street upon which Drysdale
lived, Mrs. Potter, and another lady, lagged behind the others, and the main body were quite
a distance in advance. Mrs. Potter suggested that they put their horses at full speed, in order
to overtake their friends. Mrs. Robbins, her companion, assented, and they dashed off together.
The latter's horse was the faster of the two, however, and Mrs. Potter was about fifty or sixty
yards in the rear, when they approached the Drysdale place. There was no one in sight on the
street, and there was so much foliage on each side, that the road was quite hidden from the
view of the scattered houses.

Suddenly, Mrs. Robbins heard a shriek and a fall behind her; quickly reining in her horse,
she turned back, passing Mrs. Potter's riderless horse on the way. She soon discovered Mrs.
Potter lying by the roadside, groaning, and in great pain. Mrs. Robbins did not stop to ask
any questions; she saw that Mrs. Potter was badly hurt, and she knew that assistance must be
brought instantly. She therefore, galloped up the drive to the Drysdale house, and hastily
told them what had happened. In less than three minutes, Mr. Drysdale had improvised a stretcher
out of a wicker settee and a mattress, and had summoned four stout negroes to bring it after
him, while he and his wife hurried out to the road. There they found Mrs. Potter and Mrs. Robbins
supporting her. She said that she was in great pain, from severe contusion, and possible dislocation
of the knee joint, and that she had also sustained some internal injuries. In a very few minutes,
they had tenderly placed her on the settee, and carried her up to the house. She was carefully
put to bed, and Mrs. Robbins remounted her horse to go for a physician. The latter, on his
arrival, said that he could hardly tell the extent of Mrs. Potter's injuries at once, but he
thought they would not confine her to her bed for more than a week or two. She asked if she
might be removed to the hotel, as she did not wish to trespass on Mrs. Drysdale's hospitality.
Mrs. Drysdale, however, refused to hear of such a thing as the removal of a sick person from
her house, and she said that she should enjoy Mrs. Potter's society enough to compensate for
the slight trouble. It was decided, therefore, that Mrs. Potter should remain until she was
able to go without assistance. She improved very rapidly, but her knee seemed to pain her considerably,
and she spent most of her time in her room, or on a sofa under the veranda, whither her stout
negro nurse used to carry her.

A few days afterwards, Mrs. Potter was lying awake in her room at about seven o'clock in the
morning. Mr. and Mrs. Drysdale's room was next to hers, and the transom over the connecting
door was open, so that whatever was said in one room could be easily heard in the other. Mrs.
Potter heard Drysdale get up and open the blinds to let in the morning sun. He had hardly done
so ere he gave a sharp cry and sank into a chair.

"What is the matter?" asked Mrs. Drysdale, in great alarm.

"Oh, nothing," he replied; "I don't feel well."

"I should think you wouldn't," said Mrs. Drysdale, "for you have had the nose-bleed terribly.
Why, it is all over the pillow and floor, and leads out of the door. You must have gone down
stairs."

"Yes, yes," he exclaimed, hastily, "I did get up in the night. I--I don't feel very well--I
guess I will lie down again."

"Is there anything I can do for you?" asked his wife, anxiously.

"No, nothing at present. Just go right along with your household affairs, as usual; I shall
be all right in a short time."

Mrs. Drysdale saw that her husband was nervous and irritable, and so she dressed quickly and
went down to superintend her domestic duties. When Mrs. Potter's breakfast was ready, she brought
it up herself and stopped a few minutes to talk.

"Do you know of any remedy for bleeding at the nose, Mrs. Potter?" she asked. "My husband had
quite a severe attack last night, and he went down on the front veranda, and then down the
gravel walk, thinking, I suppose, that exercise would stop it. It must have bled frightfully,
for I could see marks of blood all the way down the path to the gate."

"I suppose he let it run instead of trying to stop the flow," replied Mrs. Potter. "Some people
think it is good for the health occasionally, and so they allow the nose to bleed as long as
it wants to."

After a few more remarks, Mrs. Drysdale went down stairs again. Mrs. Potter could hear Mr.
Drysdale tossing about on the bed in the next room, muttering to himself, and occasionally
speaking aloud such expressions as--"Oh! this is horrible!"--"What does this mean?"--"My God!
what could have done it?"

After a time he became quieter, but he did not leave his room until the afternoon. Soon after
he got up, Mr. Andrews called to see him, having failed to find him at his office.

"I thought you might be sick and so I dropped in to see you," he said.

"I am very glad you came," replied Drysdale. "I have been a little unwell, and I need some
one to cheer me up."

"Let us take a short walk," said Andrews; "the exercise will do you good."

As they strolled out, Andrews pointed to some blood and said:

"Any one hurt in your house?"

"No--yes--that is, nothing serious; one of my negroes cut his hand this morning," replied Drysdale,
shuddering. "I can't look at blood without feeling sick," he explained, as he saw that Andrews
was wondering at his agitation.

As they continued their walk, Andrews noticed that Drysdale was very self-absorbed, and so
they strolled down the street without conversing. Their course took them past the bank, and
as Mr. McGregor was standing on the steps of the side entrance, he accosted them heartily.

"Why, how do you do, gentlemen?" he asked. "Won't you walk in for a few minutes? I havn't seen
you since your illness, Mr. Drysdale; won't you come in and rest a while?"

On hearing McGregor's salutation, Drysdale started as if stung, and trembled violently. He
had been walking along with his eyes down, so that he had not seen Mr. McGregor until spoken to.

"No, thank you," he replied; "I think I won't have time--that is, I promised my wife to come
back soon. You must excuse me this time."

He hurried on with a nervous gesture of courtesy, and he did not recover his calmness until
some minutes afterward. Andrews accompanied him to his home, and on the way they agreed to
go to Drysdale's plantation for a short visit on the following Monday. Having settled upon
the time for starting and returning, Andrews declined an invitation to dine with Drysdale that
evening, and they separated. Andrews dropped into Breed's shop on his way back to the hotel,
and there he found young Green, the man who had made his book-case. They talked together only
a few minutes, and Andrews then went to his room, where he stayed the remainder of the day.

On Monday, Andrews and Drysdale rode off to the plantation at daylight, and the latter's spirits
seemed to lighten rapidly after leaving the immediate vicinity of Atkinson. In the afternoon,
Andrews took his gun and wandered off into the woods, but he did not seem very desirous of
shooting anything, for he soon took a position whence he commanded a full view of the house.
In about half an hour, Drysdale came out and walked slowly toward a small cluster of trees,
about five hundred yards from the house. Here, he leaned against a tree, and paused to look
around in every direction; then he began to stride with a measured step in a straight line.
When he stopped, he began to examine the ground carefully for some minutes, and finally, he
seemed satisfied with his inspection, and returned to the house.

During the remainder of their stay at the plantation, Andrews and Drysdale were constantly
together, and the latter seemed to find the greatest pleasure in the former's society. He frequently
recurred to the subject of ghosts and spooks, and always closed by discussing the character
of the apparition he had seen on the roadside. There was no doubt that it had made a deep impression
upon him, for he never tired of talking about it. Andrews laughed at him, ridiculed his vivid
imagination, cross-questioned him, and reasoned with him upon the absurdity of his hallucination,
but all to no effect; Drysdale maintained in the most dogged manner, that he had seen a ghost.

On Friday, they were to return to Atkinson, and in the morning Andrews rode over to make a
short visit to a neighbor. He was so hospitably entertained, however, that he did not get away
until after two o'clock, and it was nearly three before they started on their homeward ride.
As before, it was growing dusky, when they reached the banks of Rocky Creek, and Drysdale was
in a state of high nervous excitement.

On reaching the spot where Drysdale had seen the ghost before, he kept close at Andrews' side,
and endeavored to appear unconcerned. Suddenly, he grasped Andrews by the arm with a faint
groan, and said:

"Andrews, look! look! for God's sake, tell me, don't you see it?"

As he spoke, he pointed toward the same ghastly object which he had seen before. There, right
under his eyes, passed the image of the murdered George Gordon.

"There, I was afraid you would have the same folly again," said Andrews, soothingly, as if
anxious to attract his attention away from his ghostly friend. "What the devil is the matter
with you?"

"Tell me, tell me, Andrews," gasped Drysdale, in such terror that his parched throat and quivering
lips could hardly pronounce the words; "can't you see that horrible man close to the fence,
walking toward the creek?"

"I tell you, my dear fellow," replied Andrews, earnestly, "that you are laboring under a most
unpleasant hallucination. There is absolutely no person, or any moving object in sight, except
you and me."

At this moment, the sound of approaching hoof-beats could be plainly heard, and Drysdale turned
his head to look back in the direction whence they came. On looking for the ghost again, it
was nowhere to be seen.

"Andrews, it is gone--the earth has swallowed it up," he said.

He would have fallen from his horse, if Andrews had not caught him around the waist, and just
as he did so, Mr. Breed and Mr. O'Fallon, the station agent, rode up, one on each side of them.

"What's the matter with Mr. Drysdale?" asked O'Fallon.

"Didn't you see it? Tell me--did the ghost pass you?" Drysdale queried eagerly, turning toward
the new comers.

"What are you talking about? What do you mean by 'the ghost?'" asked Mr. Breed, in great wonderment.

"The ghost, I say--did neither of you see a horrible figure pass out of sight suddenly, toward
the creek yonder?"

"I saw nothing, Mr. Drysdale," said O'Fallon; "did you, Breed?"

"Well, I don't know what Mr. Drysdale means by a ghost," said Breed, deliberately; "but I think
I did see something down there. I couldn't say what it looked like. Why do you call it a ghost,
Mr. Drysdale?"

"Because I have seen it twice close to me, and Mr. Andrews has not been able to see it at all,"
replied Drysdale with great difficulty. "I began to think it must have been imagination on
my part, but now, that you have seen it, I know that it was a ghost."

Drysdale was so helpless, that it was necessary for one gentleman to ride on each side of him
to hold him in his saddle. On arriving at his place, they helped him into the house, and left
him in charge of his wife. He immediately went to bed, and during the night, he suffered a
great deal. Mrs. Potter heard him groaning, tossing, and muttering until nearly daylight.

The story of the ghost was soon freely circulated by O'Fallon and Breed, though they could
not describe the apparition at all. Still, it created quite an excitement, and the results
were not very beneficial to the neighborhood, for the reason that no negro could be induced
to pass along that part of the road after dark; indeed, there were a great many educated white
people who would not ride past the spot alone on a dark night.

Drysdale was confined to his room for several days, during which time he received no visitors
except Andrews. It was curious to observe what a strong preference he showed for his new-found
friend.

Just at this time I decided to re-visit Atkinson myself, and on my arrival there I had a long
interview with Messrs. Ballantine, McGregor, and Gordon. I explained to them all the steps
I had taken, and they learned to their great astonishment that Mr. Andrews, Mrs. Potter, and
Mr. Green were my detectives. The ghost was Green, whose resemblance to young Gordon was a
great aid in carrying out the scheme. Mrs. Potter had voluntarily fallen from her horse in
order to get herself carried into Drysdale's house, and it was she who sprinkled the blood
over Drysdale's clothing and down the walk. After settling all our plans, I returned to the
hotel, where I was easily able to obtain a private interview with Mr. Andrews and Mr. Green.

I gave full instructions to Andrews, and he informed Mrs. Potter of my wishes, at the same
time conveying to her another large bottle of blood.

CHAPTER VII.

About one o'clock that night Mrs. Potter rose, quietly dressed herself, and stealthily left
the house. She walked to the nearest point on the creek and began to drop blood from her bottle.
She spilled small portions of it all the way back to the house, up the front walk, in the hall,
and finally, slipping into Drysdale's room, she scattered the crimson drops on his pillow.
She then retired to bed.

When she awoke in the morning, she found Mrs. Drysdale in a very uneasy state of mind. She
said that her husband had again been attacked by bleeding at the nose, and that he was quite
weak from the loss of blood. Mrs. Potter deeply sympathized with Mrs. Drysdale, but she could
assist her only by kind and consoling words.

The family had hardly finished their breakfast when a number of the neighbors came in in a
high state of excitement. They said that blood had been discovered on the grass near where
the ghost had been seen, and that quite a crowd had gathered around it. They had found other
blood-marks at intervals along the road, and on following the direction in which they traveled,
it was found that they led straight to Drysdale's house. The question now arose, did the wounded
person go from the house to the creek, or vice versa. Drysdale was terribly excited on learning
of the discovery, and he was soon in a species of delirium. It was known that he was quite
sick, so that the neighbors soon withdrew. Many thought that the blood was that of a burglar
or negro sneak-thief, who might have gone to Drysdale's house to steal, but who had been frightened
off before he had secured any plunder. The blood might have been from an old hurt. Others,
more superstitiously inclined, believed that the ghost was in some way responsible for the
blood. No one was able to solve the mystery, however, and it added to the terror with which
the ghost story had inspired the negroes.

Drysdale was now confined to his bed, and he would see no one except his wife and Andrews.
He insisted that he was not sick, but only run down by overwork, and so refused to have a doctor.
Andrews' influence over him was greater than that of any one else, and it was plain that the
latter had completely secured his confidence. As I now felt convinced that Drysdale would surely
confess in a short time, I returned to Chicago, leaving the whole charge of the operation with
Andrews.

A few nights later Mrs. Potter was troubled with the tooth-ache, and she lay awake most of
the night. Suddenly she heard footsteps in Drysdale's room, and then she saw Drysdale pass
her window on the veranda. He was dressed in slippers and night-dress, and his actions were
so strange that she determined to follow him. Hastily putting on some dark clothes, she hurried
cautiously after him. The night was clear with no moon, and she was able to distinguish his
white figure at a considerable distance. He walked rapidly to the creek and followed its windings
a short distance; then he paused a few minutes, as if reflecting. This enabled Mrs. Potter
to hide herself near by in some undergrowth, whence she could watch him more carefully. To
her great astonishment, she saw him walk into the creek at a shallow spot, and begin wading
up against the current. Very soon he stopped and leaned over with his hands in the water, as
if he were feeling for something. In a few minutes he came out of the stream, on the opposite
side from that on which he had entered, and took a path to a footbridge leading across the
creek toward his house. As soon as she saw that he was on his way back, she hastened home as
rapidly as possible, arriving there only a few seconds before him.

The next morning, Drysdale appeared at the breakfast table for the first time, in several days.
He remarked that he felt much better, but he said nothing of his midnight walk, nor did his
wife, as she had slept in a separate room; however, she was probably ignorant of it.

Neither Mrs. Potter, nor Mr. Andrews could imagine what Drysdale's object was in making his
pilgrimage to the creek at that time of night, especially as he had always shown the greatest
aversion to that vicinity, ever since he had first seen the ghost. I was equally puzzled when
I was informed of his freak, but I determined to make use of the incident, in case he should
do the same thing again. I therefore instructed Andrews to have Green watch the house every
night, dressed in his apparition suit. He was then to "shadow" Drysdale, when the latter went
out, and if a favorable opportunity should present itself, he was to appear before him in full
view in the role of the ghost.

By this time, Drysdale had recovered sufficiently, to attend to his office duties, but he always
seemed anxious to have Andrews with him. In order, answer whether no friends, or did not, arise we from

Upon leaving Drysdale, Andrews came to me to report. I had arranged with Mr. McGregor, to pay
a visit to the creek that night, to search the spot which had been visited so often by Drysdale.
I therefore sent Andrews back to offer to remain with Drysdale during the night. This arrangement
pleased Drysdale very much, and he was quite touched by Andrews' kindness. I also instructed
Green to watch Drysdale's house, so as to be ready to appear before Drysdale, in case the latter
left his house. He was to cross and re-cross Drysdale's path, until Drysdale should take notice
of him, while Andrews was to be at hand immediately, pretending that he had fallen asleep during
his watch, and on waking up suddenly and finding Drysdale gone, had come out in search of him.

I told Mr. Bannatine and Mr. McGregor, to bring a wheelbarrow, pick-axe, and large shovel with
them, since we should probably need the two latter to dig up the gold, while the wheelbarrow
would be handy to carry it home. Everything was provided for in advance, and I felt confident
of the success of our expedition.

CHAPTER IX.

The night was clear and bright, and everything was favorable for our work. At twelve o'clock,
we met as previously agreed, and hastened to the banks of Rocky Creek, at the spot which Green
had pointed out to me that day. On reaching the designated place, I threw off my coat and waded
into the creek. I soon found a large flat stone, which I removed to one side. I was just beginning
to dig under it, when Green hurried up and told me that Drysdale had left the house, and that
he was only a short distance behind. We quickly hid ourselves in the underbrush, and in a few
moments Drysdale appeared. Green passed him back and forth, several times, but Drysdale paid
no attention to him whatever. Suddenly the thought flashed upon me, that he was walking in
his sleep, and I soon saw that such was the case. All of his midnight promenades were now accounted
for, and it was not strange that he had not noticed Green. So great was the man's anxiety and
nervous dread of discovery, that he could not rest in quiet, and he was forced to visit the
spot where his blood-stained treasure was concealed, even in his hours of repose.

He now waded into the creek, as before, but he remained a much longer time than usual, as he
was unable to find the large flat stone in its accustomed spot. Finally, he discovered where
I had thrown it, and he immediately replaced it in the very hole whence I had taken it. He
then returned to the house, and went to bed.

I again removed the stone, and while Mr. McGregor handled the pick-axe, I plied the shovel
vigorously. In a very few minutes, we struck a piece of wood which gave back a hollow sound.
This encouraged us to renewed activity, and we were richly rewarded by unearthing a large cheese-box,
whose weight gave ample proof of the value of its contents. Having replaced the flat stone
where we first found it, we put the box on the wheelbarrow, and took turns in wheeling it to
the bank, where we soon broke it open and discovered, as we had expected, that it was full
of gold coin in rouleaux. The counting of this large sum of money was rather tedious, but it
was finally accomplished satisfactorily, and the result showed that only eighty dollars were
missing.

The officers of the bank were in high glee, and they asked me whether I had any hope of recovering
the paper money.

"If I am not mistaken," I replied, "I shall find the paper money also, within twenty-four hours.
I shall go to Drysdale's plantation to-morrow night, and shall search the ground in that group
of trees of which you have already heard so much. I think we shall find there all the paper money."

The next day, Drysdale and Andrews remained together constantly; indeed, Drysdale did not seem
willing to let Andrews leave his sight for a moment. He was perfectly helpless and inert. In
the evening, I met my companions of the night previous, and we drove out to Drysdale's plantation,
taking along the necessary tools. We secured our horses in the grove, and then Green led the
way toward the spot where Drysdale had examined the ground. On making a close examination with
our dark lanterns, we discovered a piece of sod which had evidently been taken up, for the
edges had not yet joined with the surrounding turf. We quickly pulled it up and began to dig
beneath it; as before, our search was rewarded after a few minutes of labor. At the depth of
two feet, we came upon a large candle-box, which we carefully dug up and placed in one of our
buggies. There was apparently, nothing more concealed in this spot, and so we replaced the
earth, packed it down, and put the piece of sod back into its place. We then returned to Atkinson,
where we arrived just before daylight. The bank officers immediately opened the box, and counted
the paper money contained therein; it was found to agree exactly, with the sum stolen from
the bank. The packages of bills were replaced in the box, which was then locked up in the vault.

I sent instructions by Andrews to Mrs. Potter to again make use of the blood about Drysdale's
house, and I also ordered Green to keep watch during the night. The next morning Andrews reported
that Drysdale's terror on discovering the blood had been greater than he had ever shown before,
and that he was fast breaking down. I therefore held a consultation with the bank officers.

"Now, gentlemen," I said, "we have recovered the money, and we have sufficient evidence to
convict the murderer. I think it is time to arrest him; don't you?"

To tell the truth, I was in no easy frame of mind myself. I was morally sure of Drysdale's
guilt, but I had no legal evidence which was sufficient to convict him in case he should maintain
his innocence. Moreover I had assumed a terrible responsibility in taking such extreme measures
with him, for there was danger that he might go insane without confessing his guilt, and in
that case my position would have been really dangerous. I should have been accused of driving
him crazy with no proper justification for my actions, and the result might have been most
disastrous to me. The fact that I, an unknown man from the North, had driven a high-toned Southern
gentleman insane, would have been sufficient to hang me by the summary process of lynch law.

The fact that part of the money had been found on his plantation, would be only circumstantial
evidence, since another man might have buried it there as well as Drysdale. His visits to the
spots where the money was concealed, were not conclusive of guilt, since he was a somnambulist,
and in his sleep-walking he was not responsible for his actions. Mrs. Potter suggested to me
that he might have been sleep-walking the night of the murder, and (while in that condition,)
he might have followed the murderer to the spot where the gold was hidden; it would then be
nothing strange that he should go to the same spot in his subsequent night-wanderings.

It will thus be easily understood that during the remainder of my connection with the case,
I was in a highly wrought up frame of mind. Indeed, when I came to make the arrest, it would
have been hard to tell whether Drysdale or I was the more excited. In reply to my question,
Mr. Bannatine instructed me to take whatever course I saw fit, as they were all perfectly satisfied
with my management of the affair. I learned from Andrews that Drysdale would visit his office
that afternoon, as there were some important matters requiring his attention. Drysdale had
told Andrews that he intended to put the office in the charge of a deputy for a time, so as
to enable him to go off to New Orleans on a visit of several weeks, and he desired that Andrews
should accompany him. He little thought that the toils were closing around him so rapidly,
and that he should never start on his projected excursion.

Having decided to arrest him immediately, I went to the office of an old friend of Mr. Bannatine,
a lawyer, who drew up the necessary affidavit upon which I proposed to apply for a warrant.
I then called upon the sheriff, and asked him to go before a justice of the peace with me,
while I swore to an affidavit for a warrant which I wished him to execute.

"What is the warrant for?" asked the sheriff, as he walked along with me.

"It is quite an important case," I replied, "and I have had the affidavits drawn up by Mr.
Wood, the lawyer, and you will see the charge in a few minutes."

"All right," said the sheriff; "let us go to Squire Baker's."

Fortunately we found the justice alone, and having stated that I wished to obtain a warrant,
I handed him the affidavit which I had had prepared. He carefully adjusted his glasses and
began to read the paper, but in a moment or two he gave a sudden start and dropped the document,
in utter amazement. He looked at me keenly and said:

"Do you mean to accuse Mr. Drysdale of murdering George Gordon?"

At this the sheriff was equally astonished, and he said:

"Oh! nonsense; it can't be possible. Why, do you know, my dear sir, that he is one of the finest
gentlemen, and one of the most honorable men in Atkinson? Surely you are joking."

"No, I am not joking at all," I replied. "I knew, of course, that you would be greatly surprised
and shocked, but the proofs are too clear to admit of any doubt. The matter has been carefully
examined by Mr. Bannatine, Mr. Gordon, and Mr. McGregor, and it is at their request that I
have come to get a warrant. However, I can soon convince you of his guilt."

"How did you come to murder George?" I asked.

"I can't tell," he replied, in a choking voice; "it all occurred like a dream."

"What motive did you have? You surely could have got money without resorting to robbery, much
less murder."

"No, I could not. People think I am wealthy, but the fact is I lost a great deal of money in
speculating when I went to New Orleans, a few months before the murder, and although I have
a good deal of property, I had no ready money, and I could not work my plantation properly
for want of it. I had purchased seven slaves from a man in New Orleans, and I could not pay
for them. He was pressing me for the money, about twelve hundred dollars, and I came down to
the bank to get the money from George. I had only three hundred dollars in bank, and so I gave
my note for the remainder. While George was counting out the money, I was taken with a sort
of insanity, and I struck him with a large hammer which happened to be at hand. Then I carried
off the money and buried it, since which time I have never touched it. It has been a curse
to me. This is all I have to say now."

I turned to Mr. Bannatine and said:

"I have now done all that I can do in this matter, I think."

"Yes, you have completed your task, and the law must now take its course," he replied. "Mr.
Ringwood, you had better take charge of Mr. Drysdale."

Drysdale rose from his chair, wearily, and said:

"I am glad the end has come at last. This affair has been killing me by inches, and I am glad
I have confessed."

The sheriff then touched him on the shoulder and said that he must go.

"Yes, I am ready," he replied, "but please let me speak a few words privately, to Mr. Andrews;
I want to send a message to my wife," he added, with a sob.

He and Andrews then stepped into the small private office, and Andrews closed the door behind him.

"Andrews, my friend," said Drysdale, convulsively, "I beg you to break this news to my poor
wife. God help her and the children. Tell her that I feel better for having confessed, and
whatever happens she must keep up her courage. Now, my dear friend, good bye. Tell the sheriff
to come here and take me to jail."

He wrung Andrews' hand warmly as the latter stepped to the door, but before the latter had
reached us, we heard the ringing report of a pistol shot. We made a simultaneous rush for the
little room, but we were too late. There, quivering on the floor, with a bullet in his brain,
lay the murderer of George Gordon. The crime and the avengement had occurred in the same building,
only a few feet separating the spot where the two bodies had fallen. The somnambulist had walked
on earth for the last time.

THE END.

THE MURDERER AND THE FORTUNE TELLER.

CHAPTER I.

One sultry day in the summer of 185-, I arrived in Chicago, from a tour I had been making through
the Southern States. I had attended to a portion of the accumulated business which I found
awaiting me, when a gentleman entered the outer office and asked one of my clerks whether he
could see me immediately on some very important business. Mr. Howard saw by the gentleman's
appearance, that the matter must be one of great consequence, and, therefore, ushered the visitor
into my private office, without asking any questions.

"Mr. Pinkerton, I believe?" said the gentleman, as he advanced toward me.

"Yes, sir," I replied; "what can I do for you?"

He took a letter from his pocket and handed it to me. I motioned him to be seated, while I
read the letter. I found it to be from my old friend Chapman, a lawyer in New Haven, Connecticut,
introducing the bearer, Captain J. N. Sumner. The letter stated that Captain Sumner was a resident
of Springfield, Massachusetts, near which place he owned a farm. He had a moderate fortune,
and he was a most estimable man. Mr. Chapman had known him for many years, during which time
he had always borne himself in an upright, straightforward manner, free from all reproach.
Lately, however, he had become involved in some very serious difficulties in the West, and
Mr. Chapman had advised him to see me, and obtain my assistance in extricating himself from
his troubles. Mr. Chapman concluded by saying, that he was confident, that, if any one could
aid the Captain, I was the best person to consult.

I had not seen Mr. Chapman for some years, the last time having been while I was attending
to some business in which he was interested. He was especially noted as a criminal lawyer being
employed quite as often for the prosecution, as for the defense. We were the best of friends,
and had cracked many a joke at each other's expense. He did not mention the nature of the Captain's
troubles in his letters, leaving that for the Captain to do himself.

While I was reading the letter, I was aware that the Captain was observing me closely, as if
desirous of reading my very thoughts. When I had finished, I said:

"Captain Sumner, I am glad to meet you. Any one bearing a letter from my old friend Chapman,
is welcome."

As I spoke, I looked straight at him, and took in his whole appearance.

He was apparently, about fifty years of age, but was very well preserved, not a streak of gray
being visible in his dark, curly hair. He was slightly above the middle height, and his frame
was proportionally powerful, his limbs being well knit, and muscular. His clear, hazel eyes
looked frankly out beneath heavy, straight eyebrows, while his large Roman nose and massive
chin, gave his face great firmness and determination. His teeth were white and regular, and
his smile was unusually sweet and expressive. His face was much tanned from long exposure to
the weather, and his hands were large and hard. He was dressed in a quiet, neat suit of gray
cloth, well fitting but easy, and there was nothing loud or in bad taste about him. His only
articles of jewelry were a gold watch and chain, and a seal ring with a peculiar, plain stone,
worn on the little finger of his left hand. I gazed steadily at him for about two minutes,
which is about as long a time as I need to obtain a correct opinion of a man's character. I
was very favorably impressed by his appearance, and I prepared to hear his story with more
interest than I should have had, if he had been a less honest, reliable looking man.

He opened the conversation, while I was still looking straight into his face.

"Mr. Pinkerton," he said, "I have heard a great deal about you from various sources, and I
little thought that I should ever require your services; but, lately, while consulting Mr.
Chapman relative to a possible flaw in the title to my farm, I also laid before him some other
troubles which he acknowledged were so serious as to require the advice and assistance of some
one with a training and experience somewhat different from his. He urged me so strongly to
state my case to you, and obtain your aid, that I have finally decided to follow his advice,
and here I am."

"When did you arrive?" I inquired.

"About a week ago. I looked around for a time to see if my difficulties had diminished,----"(and
he passed his hand nervously through his hair, drawing a long breath)--"but I found they had
increased, if anything. Mr. Pinkerton, when I retired from the sea and settled down on my farm,
I thought my cares and vexations were over, and that I could find in the peace and tranquility
of country life, a rich reward for the hardships I had endured while earning enough to retire
on. My father, also, was a sailor many years, and, after passing the best part of his life
at sea, in like manner, he was able to live his last twenty years in peace and content upon
his farm; there I was reared, until I was old enough to go to sea. I have followed his example;
but, instead of enjoying the peace he did, I find that my serious troubles are only just beginning.
If I were at sea, I should have no fears, for there I am perfectly at home. No matter how the
wind might blow, or the seas roll, I always brought my ship through in safety. I could read
the signs of the weather, and could detect the approach of danger from the elements. I knew
my enemies were there, and that was half the battle. Here, on land, I find it so different;
my worst enemies come to me with the smiles and greetings of friends; they express the tenderest
wishes for my welfare, and shower upon me the tokens of their affection; then, having fairly
won my confidence, they turn upon me when I least expect it, and stab me cruelly. I am a plain,
blunt man--often irritable and unjust, I know--still, I never flinch from danger when I can
see it; but, the very nature of my bringing up has rendered me unfit to cope with the wiles
and subtleties of my fellow man. You, Mr. Pinkerton, it is said, have the power to see direct
to the hearts of men through the shams and artifices by which they seek to hide their true
characters, and you are the only man who can assist me. Oh, I wish I were back on the sea,
far away from all my troubles. I should care but little if I never returned."

He spoke in a low voice, but the tone was clear until the last, when his words were very pathetic.
As he closed, his head dropped forward, and he sat gazing fixedly at his ring in an attitude
of mournful retrospection.

"Perhaps you had better wait awhile before telling me your story," I suggested.

"Yes," he replied, looking at his watch, "it is now five o'clock, so I will defer making my
statement until to-morrow; though I should prefer to make it now, if I had time. The story
is a long one, and I shall have to take a considerable portion of your valuable time in telling
it. Will you please to name the hour when I can meet you to-morrow, to give you all the facts
in the case?"

I had already become interested in the Captain, and, after thinking for a moment how I could
best arrange my other business so as to grant him the necessary time, I told him to come at
nine o'clock next morning. He said he would be punctual in keeping the appointment; then stepping
forward, he took my hand and said, in a very impressive way, "Mr. Pinkerton, I shall meet you
if I am alive. I am not afraid of death; I have met it scores of times, face to face, and have
never flinched from it; but now I must take care of myself. If I don't come, just look for
me at my boarding house."

I glanced quickly at him, but could see nothing wrong about his mind. His eyes were clear and
natural; his whole appearance showed him to be a plain, blunt seaman, little disposed to invent
imaginary dangers. Still, there was in his manner, a deep melancholy which showed me that it
was not any natural disease that he dreaded, and which caused me to exclaim:

"Why, Captain, you fear death by violence, do you not?"

"Yes," he replied; "but I cannot enter into details at present. I shall try to save myself
and meet you to-morrow morning, but if I do not come, please send my body to Connecticut, to
be interred near the rest of my family."

He then said good-day and went out, leaving me to speculate upon his peculiar behavior, and
to wonder what were the dangers which surrounded him. I was so much pleased with his frank,
manly simplicity that I was determined to give him all the assistance in my power.

CHAPTER II.

At nine o'clock the next morning, Captain Sumner walked into my private office, and I immediately
locked the door to avoid interruption. I noticed that he was apparently much more contented
than he had been the evening previous; but I said nothing, preferring to have him tell his
story in his own way. He began immediately, without wasting time in preliminaries:

"Mr. Pinkerton, I know that you are always busy, and that time is money to you; hence, I shall
be as brief as possible. In order to begin right, I must go slightly into my family history.
My father owned a farm near Springfield, Massachusetts, where my mother brought up the family
while he was away at sea. He was as fine a seaman as ever trod a deck, and became Captain in
one of the regular lines of East India packet companies while I was a mere child. Communion,

 He was
dressed in the height of the prevailing fashion, and he showed a good deal of jewelry. They
both pressed me to accompany them to the opera, but as I was not appropriately dressed, I declined
politely, and they went without me.

"I had previously learned at the office of the company, that they had not heard anything of
Henry, so I sorrowfully returned aboard my ship, almost decided to give up a sea-faring life.
I was then fifty years of age, and I thought of buying a farm, where I could settle down at
my ease. I knew that Annie was in a dangerous position for a handsome woman--left alone with
no one to advise or restrain her--and I wished to take her with me, so as to remove her from
temptation. I therefore, wrote to Lucy, asking her opinion, and requesting her to advise Annie
to give up her present mode of life.

"Lucy wrote a long letter in reply: she said that she very much feared there was something
wrong between Annie and Pattmore; when Annie was staying at Greenville, Lucy had written twice,
asking her to come to Morristown, where Lucy lived; Annie had promised to do so, but she had
never come. Pattmore, Lucy said, was a prominent politician in Greenville, and he was looking
forward to the nomination for congressman. Mrs. Pattmore was a very good woman, of fine appearance
and agreeable manners; she was very domestic in her tastes and she delighted in taking care
of her home and children. There were three children living, the eldest son being about twenty-one
years old, and the other two being quite young. Mr. Pattmore's hotel was very well kept and
popular, and he was supposed to be wealthy.

"Lucy's letter added greatly to the anxiety which I felt about Annie, and I was very desirous
of resigning my command immediately, in order to settle down on a farm with her, and thus remove
her from the temptations of a gay city. I felt sure that nothing more would be necessary than
a retired, quiet life for a few months, to prepare her to give Henry a joyful and affectionate
welcome on his return. Circumstances, however, made it impossible for me to give up my ship
at that time, and, at the earnest request of the directors of the company (in which I had invested
a considerable portion of my savings) I consented to make one or two more cruises. Accordingly,
I sailed for the East Indies for the last time, and made a very speedy and prosperous voyage.
I continued my inquiries for Henry Thayer, but was unable to obtain any tidings of him. On
my return, I called to see Annie, and found her occupying her old position as music teacher
in Brooklyn. She said that Mrs. Pattmore had urged her so strongly to visit them that she had
accepted the invitation twice during my absence.

"I had hardly reached New York, before I was hurried away again; my ship was hastily loaded
with a cargo for Rio Janeiro, and I again sailed in command. The trip was a speculative venture,
which resulted very profitably, and, on my return, I asked to be relieved from further service.
I was then fifty-three years of age, and I needed rest. The company treated me very handsomely,
and I sold my shares at a high valuation. Having settled my affairs with the company, I hurried
off to see Annie; but I was surprised to find that she had moved to Greenville, where she was
teaching music to Mr. Pattmore's younger children.

"I had bought a farm near Springfield, Massachusetts, sometime previous, and, learning that
there was some slight inaccuracy in the deed, I went to New Haven to consult a lawyer--your
friend, Mr. Chapman--relative to the title. While there, I wrote to Annie, asking her to come
and live on the farm with me. She immediately replied that she was under an engagement as teacher
for six months, and that she could not leave Greenville until the end of that time. She said
that Lucy had asked her to pay a visit to Morristown, but that she had been obliged to decline
the invitation for the same reason. In conclusion, Annie begged me to visit her in Greenville.

"As soon, therefore, as I had settled my business affairs, I went to Greenville to stay a few
days. Annie seemed very glad to see me, and appeared to be in excellent health. I repeated
my proposal, that she should come to keep house for me on my farm, and she seemed favorably
disposed toward the arrangement, though she asked time to think about it. I told her that at
my death, I should leave her all my property, and that, meantime, she should have everything
she wished. I also tried to talk to her about Henry, but she refused to say much, and seemed
desirous to believe that he was dead.

"I found that she had very little to do as a teacher, the children being too young to study;
but she was much attached to Greenville, as, to use her own words, 'there were so many fashionable
people there.' She used to go out driving with Mr. and Mrs. Pattmore, and sometimes with Mr.
Pattmore alone, often going as far as fifteen or twenty miles into the country. I did not at
all like the way she was acting, and I determined to use every effort to induce her to return
to Massachusetts with me. This visit, Mr. Pinkerton, took place about two months ago.

"After remaining in Greenville a few days, I went to visit Lucy in Morristown. We had a long
talk together about Annie, and finally, Lucy confided to me that she feared that Annie was
enceinte.

"'Good heavens, Lucy! that is impossible!' I exclaimed. 'Our family has never had such a disgrace
cast upon it before; it has always maintained its purity. No, no; it can't be possible.'

"'I am not sure of it,' said Lucy; 'but I know there is something wrong with her, and I greatly
fear that she is a ruined woman.'

"I hardly knew what to say or do, the mere suspicion was such a terrible blow."

Here the Captain became greatly affected; the perspiration started on his forehead in large
beads, and he often made long pauses, as he continued. His emotion would sometimes entirely
overcome him, so that he could not speak.

"Well," he went on, "Lucy wrote to Annie, and back came the answer fully confirming the horrid
suspicion. Annie freely confessed that she was enceinte, and that Pattmore was the father of
her unborn child. She said that she and Pattmore dearly loved each other, and that she could
not bear the thought of separating from him.

"My first impulse was to curse her and never see her again; but my old love for her could not
be set aside, and pity soon took the place of anger. I could see that Pattmore had thrown a
spell around her by his fascinating manners, and she was completely under his influence. I
determined to save her from exposure and disgrace, if possible, and, therefore, started for
Greenville immediately. I had intended to speak to Annie in a severe and indignant tone, but
she rushed to meet me with such a glad little cry that my anger melted away, and tears sprang
unbidden to my eyes.

"'Oh! Annie! Annie!' I exclaimed, 'what have you done! How has this man acquired such a terrible
power over you as to make you forget your marriage vows and live a life of infamy with him?
Have you no stings of conscience? Think how our sainted mother would feel if she could see
her little Annie in the power of a heartless libertine. Return with me at once, and I will
forget everything. In the seclusion of my farm, you need not fear the fiery tongue of scandal,
and I will be a father to your child.'

"She stood with downcast eyes while I was speaking, but when I had finished she began a vehement
defense of her conduct, in the course of which she repeated all the usual arguments of those
who wish to ease their consciences when on the downward path.

"Mr. Pattmore, she said, was a perfect gentleman; he loved her, and she returned his affection;
it was true, unhappily, that they were both married, but nature had intended them for each
other, and she preferred to obey the laws of nature to those of society; Mrs. Pattmore was
a very fine woman, but she could not make her husband happy.

"The doctrine of free-love was fully endorsed by Annie, who had learned it all by heart, and
she advanced the most extraordinary theories in justification of her conduct.

"For years, she said, she had held the first place in Pattmore's heart, and he had lavished
his money upon her freely; the diamond ring I had seen, the rich dresses she had worn, a valuable
necklace, and many other articles of jewelry were among the gifts he had showered upon her;
they loved each other as husband and wife and as soon as Mrs. Pattmore should die, Mr. Pattmore
would make Annie his legal wife.

"I saw that she was completely infatuated, but I endeavored to show her how false her reasoning
was, and to what wicked conclusions it would lead. I asked if she had forgotten Henry, who
was liable to return at any moment; she could not marry until she obtained a divorce. Besides,
the fact that they were looking forward to, and wishing for Mrs. Pattmore's death, was almost
equivalent to committing murder, since to desire any person's death was morally as bad as to
murder that person.

"We had a long conversation, and finally Annie agreed to join me in Springfield in a short
time. I therefore returned to the farm and prepared to settle down. I received no reply to
several letters which I wrote to Annie, but at last she sent me a short note saying that she
had changed her mind, and that she should stay in Greenville. I immediately replied that I
would not permit her to remain there any longer, and I then went to consult Mr. Chapman about
the matter. He acknowledged that he could do nothing, as Annie was her own mistress; but he
advised me to see you, Mr. Pinkerton, and obtain your advice and assistance. As it was a very
delicate matter, affecting the honor of my family, I did not like to speak about it to a third
party, as I feared that the story might be made known publicly, and Annie's reputation would
then be ruined. I therefore told him that I should not consult you if I could possibly avoid
doing so.

"While I was inwardly debating what was best to be done, I received a note from Annie, asking
me to come to her, as she feared that something serious was about to happen. I went at once
to Greenville, and found that she had decided to remove the evidence of her guilt by performing
an abortion. I tried hard to dissuade her from a step which might result in her own death,
but she was resolute in her determination not to wait for the child's natural birth. She said
that if I would stay with her until she recovered, she would return to Springfield with me
and never see Pattmore again. She spoke very feelingly about Henry, and she seemed so deeply
and truly penitent that I was finally won over to her wishes, and I agreed to stay with her
until she had an operation performed. I determined to take her to stay with Lucy, at Morristown,
at first, and she accordingly prepared to leave Greenville.

"She had a long private interview with Pattmore before leaving, and when she came out I saw
she had been shedding bitter tears. As I stepped to the office desk to pay my bill, I saw Pattmore
in the clerk's room back of the office, and he, too, seemed very much dejected. I could hardly
keep my hands off his throat when I recollected his villainy; but I curbed my temper by a great
effort, as I knew that a personal encounter between us would only publish my sister's shame
to the world. On our arrival in Morristown, Lucy and I had a long talk with Annie, which was
far from satisfactory to me, as I saw that she was still infatuated with Pattmore.

"I thought best to go some distance away from the places where we were known during Annie's
trial, and I therefore brought her to Chicago. Here I obtained board in a very respectable
family, where there were only a few other boarders. Annie did not show her condition in her
appearance at all, and no one could possibly have suspected her. I found a physician named
Enfield, who was a noted operator in such cases, and Annie at once placed herself under his
treatment.

"I knew that I was about to assist in committing a great crime, yet I felt that I must shield
Annie at all hazards, and so I yielded to her wishes in the matter. Enfield was an expert in
such matters, and, in a short time, he brought Annie through in safety. She was recovering
fast, when one day, on entering her room, I found Pattmore there. I went out instantly, as
I was afraid to trust myself in the same room with him; but, when he had gone away, I besought
Annie never again to admit him to her presence. She would make no promises, and finally, she
fell back in a swoon. On recovering, she said that she would die if she could not see Pattmore,
and I was obliged to drop the subject until she should become stronger. Pattmore remained in
town two days, and she insisted on having him with her a great deal of the time.

"I fear that you will consider me very weak and foolish for permitting this; but I have never
been able to refuse Annie anything. I knew, moreover, that, in such a case, harsh measures
would only add fuel to the flame, and so I continued to humor her, trusting, that in time,
she would gradually recover her normal condition, and see the folly of her conduct.

"Pattmore told her, during his visit, that he was in great hopes of receiving the democratic
nomination to Congress; and, as the democratic party had a large majority in that district,
the nomination would be equivalent to an election. He also said that his wife was in failing
health, and that she seemed to grow weaker every day. I could see by Annie's manner, when she
told me this, that she hoped to be Pattmore's partner in enjoying the gay life of the National
Capital, though she did not say so directly.

"One day, she brought up the subject of wills, and said that she thought every one owning property,
ought to make a will. She said that otherwise a man's property, in case of sudden death, might
be eaten up by the lawyers and court officials. I admitted the justness of her remarks, and
told her that I should follow her suggestion. I was obliged to go East on business for a few
days at this time, and, on the way, I left a letter and package with Pattmore, which Annie
had asked me to deliver. While in New Haven, I employed Mr. Chapman to draw up my will. Lucy
had asked me to leave all my property to Annie, as she had enough for herself and children,
while Annie had no one to look to for an honest support, except myself; accordingly, I made
my will in that way.

"On my return to Chicago, I hurried to our boarding house to see Annie, and, to my intense
disgust, I found Pattmore with her. The sight of him fondling my poor sister, was too much
for me: and, although I succeeded in restraining myself from doing him any personal violence,
I used the most severe language possible in characterizing his villainy, and in expressing
my contempt for him. I concluded, by telling him that the affair must end then and there; that
he must never address my sister again, or attempt to see her; and that if he dared to disregard
my demand, he must take the consequences. They both hung their heads guiltily, while I was
speaking, and when I closed, Pattmore quitted the room without a word. I found that he left
town the same day.

"I also went out of the house immediately, being too excited to talk calmly to Annie; but I
returned after supper, and reasoned with her as gently as possible on the impropriety and wickedness
of her conduct. She seemed to feel very sorry, and was so penitent that my hopes of saving
her, rose considerably. She promised, with tears in her eyes, to overcome her unholy love for
Pattmore, and never to see him again. I noticed, however, that when I spoke of my efforts to
obtain tidings of Henry, she was very indifferent; but she promised to return to Springfield
with me as soon as she was able to travel, and matters began to look more cheerful for the future.

"A day or two after, she received a letter from Pattmore, saying that his wife was seriously
ill, and that the physicians considered her life in danger.

"'What is the matter with her?' I asked.

"'I don't know,' she replied; 'Mr. Pattmore does not state what is her disease.'

"I then spoke very harshly about Pattmore, and said that he, above all other men, was hateful
to me, because he had ruined her. She replied in his defense, and, as our conversation seemed
likely to become bitter, I walked out to allow time for both our tempers to cool off. On my
return, I found that Annie had gone out for the first time, since her illness, but she soon
came in, saying that she had taken a short walk for exercise. She had regained her good humor,
and seemed more like herself than she had for sometime. She again brought up the subject of
wills, and I told her that I had made my will while I was in New Haven. She asked me about
it, and I told her that I had made her my sole legatee, and that she would be in comfortable
circumstances when I died. She seemed very much pleased at this, and said I was a dear good
brother; but she hoped it might be a long time before she should become heiress to my property.

"'Who knows?' she said, laughing; 'perhaps I may die first.'

"'That is possible,' I said, 'but not probable. In the course of nature, I ought to die many
years before you; and sailors are proverbially short-lived.'

"'Oh, nonsense!' she replied, 'you are so salted and tanned that you will last fifty years yet.'

"She then skipped gaily into the next room and brought out a bottle of ale, to reward me, as
she said, for being good. She poured out a glass for each of us, and we drank to each other's
good health. In about half an hour I became very sick; I vomited and retched terribly, while
my bowels seemed to be on fire. The weather was very warm, and I attributed my illness to some
fruit I had eaten, which the ale had disagreed with. I suffered agony all night, but toward
morning I became quieter and the pain gradually left me.

"At daylight I casually glanced at my ring, and I was surprised to see that the stone had turned
to a creamy white--a sure sign that my life was in danger. You will call me foolish and superstitious,
I know, but I cannot help it. A belief in the virtues of this ring is a part of my very nature,
and it has always been an unerring guide to me. This ring invariably predicts my good or bad
fortune." And so speaking, the Captain held the ring out for me to see it.

I looked him straight in the face, expecting to see some signs of insanity, or at least monomania,
in his eyes, but there were none. He was evidently perfectly rational, and this belief was
apparently as natural to him as a belief in a hereafter, or in any other religious doctrine,
is to other people. After a short pause, as I glanced at the ring, he continued:

"Now, you can see nothing strange in that stone, Mr. Pinkerton, but I can. From its appearance
I can obtain warning of approaching good or bad fortune. Away out at sea, when a storm is coming,
the stone turns black; when enemies are near me it turns the color of blood; and when I am
in danger of death, it becomes a creamy white.

"My father once saved the life of a Sepoy soldier, and, as a mark of gratitude, the latter
presented my father with three rings of wonderful powers. The Sepoy said that he had obtained
them from a Hindoo hermit, far out in the jungle. I have long tried to find other rings possessing
the same qualities, but have never succeeded. One of these rings was buried with my mother,
one with my father, and I have the third."

I looked at the ring carefully, but could see nothing remarkable about it. The stone was an
opal, set in a heavy gold band, peculiarly chased; but, aside from the popular superstition
with regard to opals, there was nothing which would lead me to suppose that it possessed any
exceptional powers.

"When I saw you last," continued the Captain, "I meant to have asked you to have this ring
buried with me, in case I died; but I was afraid you would consider the request too foolish.
I wished it buried with me because I did not wish Annie to have it."

"But why do you think Annie would take it?" I asked.

"Because I know she wants it," replied Captain Sumner. "She thinks that it would enable her
to make Pattmore love her always, and so she wishes to own it. Now, I think Pattmore is a villain,
and I wish to separate her from him and destroy his influence over her. Therefore I do not
wish her to get the ring, since its possession will induce her to continue her connection with
that man."

I confess that I did not know what to make of the Captain. If he was insane, he certainly had
the most impenetrable mask over his insanity that I had ever seen. His eyes were so bright,
clear and honest, that the most experienced physiognomist in the world would have failed to
observe the slightest trace of cunning, or want of a balanced mind in their expression. During
the progress of his story he had continually held his ring where he could see it, and several
times had raised it to the light, in a contemplative sort of way, as if he drew some satisfaction
from its appearance. He bowed his head in his hands as he ceased speaking, and some moments
elapsed before he looked up, though when he did so he was perfectly calm.

"Captain, did you find the ring of any practical value at sea?" I asked.

"Yes; often it has apprised me of a coming storm in time to prepare for it. I have thus passed
in safety through many sudden gales of the approach of which I have been warned only just in
time to save my ship. My men always had perfect confidence in my ability to weather the heaviest
gale."

"Well, Captain, if you should give that ring to me, would it be equally prophetic in my hands?"
I asked.

"But I will not give it to you nor any one else; nor will I part with it, even in death if
I can help it," replied the Captain. "The Sepoy told my father, that he must never allow the
rings to go out of his family, as they would then lose their powers. I know that the fancy
seems strange to you, and, no doubt, you think I am not exactly sane; but I have proved the
power of the ring so often, that I know its virtues, and believe in them. I may be able to
satisfy you of its value by a practical demonstration yet."

I saw that he was not insane, but terribly superstitious, so I made no further remarks about
the ring. He drew his chair closer toward me, and said in a low, painful whisper:

"Mr. Pinkerton, I have positive knowledge that Annie has attempted to poison me three times.
She put poison in that ale; she afterwards gave me some in a cup of coffee; and, the third
time, it was administered so secretly, that I do not know when I took it. The first time, I
recovered because the dose was too large, and I vomited up the poison so soon that it had not
time to act. The second time, I took only a sip of the coffee, and found that it tasted bitter,
so I threw it away, though the little I had taken distressed me exceedingly. The third time,
I nearly died, and it was only by the prompt attendance of a physician that I was saved. He
said it was a metal poison which probably came off from a copper kettle in which some fruit
had been cooked. Neither he, nor any one else, ever suspected that I had been poisoned intentionally.
When I recovered, I accused Annie of trying to poison me; she denied it vehemently at first,
but I said to her:

"'Annie, the ring tells me that I have an enemy near me, and you must be that enemy.'

"I spoke as if positive of her guilt, and, as she is a firm believer in the ring, she finally
burst into tears and confessed having given me poison at three different times. On her knees,
she begged my forgiveness, and thanked God that my life had been spared. She was so broken
down by the thought of her unnatural and wicked purpose, that I feared that she would have
a relapse into sickness. She seemed so wholly contrite, that I thought she would never undertake
such a terrible crime again, and I freely forgave her."

I looked at the Captain in perfect amazement, hardly able to credit my own senses.

"Can it be possible," I asked, "that your sister admitted that she had tried to poison you?"

"Yes," replied the Captain; "and she said that Pattmore had encouraged her to put me out of
the way. He had told her that he would marry her when his wife, (who was now dying) was dead;
that I was bitterly opposed to him, and would never consent to their marriage; that if she
would poison me, they would be married and go to California to live; and, therefore, that it
would be well for her to poison me before Mrs. Pattmore died."

"What!" I exclaimed, "is Mrs. Pattmore dying? What is her disease?"

"I do not know," replied the Captain; "but I fear that she, also, has been poisoned."

"How long is it since you had this talk with Annie?" I inquired.

"About three days ago, and she has been sick abed with excitement and remorse ever since. She
says that she expects to hear of Mrs. Pattmore's death at any time, and she is sure that Pattmore
has poisoned her. Mr. Chapman told me, when I last saw him, Mr. Pinkerton, that you were the
only person who could help me; and so I have come to you to save Mrs. Pattmore and my sister.
I feel that Mr. Chapman was right, Mr. Pinkerton, and I beg you to give me your assistance--I
will pay you liberally."

CHAPTER III.

When the Captain had finished his almost incredible story, I hardly knew what to make of it.
It was impossible to doubt his word; yet it seemed almost equally hard to believe that his
sister could have tried to murder him. Pattmore's intention of killing his wife in order to
marry Annie, was another piece of cold-blooded villainy which was almost past belief. The question
frequently came into my mind: Are all the parties in their right minds? After I had thought
about the matter in silence a few minutes, I said:

"Well, Captain Sumner, yours is certainly a strange case, and I cannot give you any answer
until I have had time for reflection. Return in three hours and I will then tell you my decision.
I will help you if I possibly can do so."

He rose to go, but stopped a moment as he reached the door, and said, with the utmost simplicity
and confidence:

"I know you can help me if you will do so, and no one else can."

After he had gone, I sent a man to the Captain's boarding house with instructions to learn
all he could about the boarders. He reported that, among others, there was a Captain Sumner
boarding there with his sister, Mrs. Annie Thayer. My detective also learned many things about
the Captain and his sister which corroborated the account given by the Captain. Having satisfied
myself that the Captain's story was true--in part at least--I sat down to reflect upon the
strange medley which he had told me.

Mrs. Thayer had, undoubtedly, committed a serious crime against her husband, besides making
the attempt on her brother's life; but I could not have her punished, for her brother's object
was to save her from the ruin in which her downward course would probably end. Pattmore, however,
was a dangerous man, and it would be necessary to proceed with caution in handling him. He
seemed to be a villain at heart, and it was probable that he only sought Mrs. Thayer's society
in order to gratify his sensual passions. Perhaps the Captain's suspicion, that Mrs. Pattmore's
illness was caused by poison administered by her husband, was correct; if so, it would be necessary
to act at once, before she should become his victim. It was barely possible that he might intend
to get a divorce from his wife and then marry Annie; but I did not consider this supposition
a very probable one. He wished to be elected to Congress, and he would not dare to give such
an opportunity for scandal as would ensue if he attempted that course. No; poison had been
his reliance in one case, and he would not scruple to make use of it again. Mrs. Thayer was
probably well informed as to all his plans, but, evidently, she would not willingly divulge
anything prejudicial to her lover. Her brother was clearly unable to compel her to confess
anything, or he would not have applied to me. Moreover he could refuse her nothing, and he
would certainly object to any attempt to force her to give evidence against her will. He admitted
that she was weak, vain and thoughtless; that she had been false to her husband; and that Pattmore
had completely bewitched her; yet the Captain resolutely stood between her and harm.

She could tell all of Pattmore's secrets if she were so disposed, and it would be easier to
get information out of her than out of him; the question was--how shall I go about it?

I reflected that she was very superstitious, as shown by her belief in the Captain's ring;
it occurred to me that I might take advantage of that trait of her character to draw her secrets
out. Why could I not introduce a fortune-teller to her, and thus learn all I wished to know?
The idea seemed to me to be admirably adapted to the necessities of the case. I sketched out,
in my mind, a skeleton plan of operations about as follows:

I should entrust the case to one of my female detectives; she would be posted upon all the
points of Mrs. Thayer's history; she would be required to learn enough of astrology, clairvoyance
and mesmerism, to pass for one of the genuine tribe; the plan would be so arranged that Mrs.
Thayer would voluntarily consult this fortune-teller, who would soon gain a complete ascendency
over her superstitious nature by revealing to her all her past life; finally Mrs. Thayer could
be brought to tell all she knew of Pattmore as a means of aiding the sibyl to read her future.

This plan seemed to me the most feasible of any, and I therefore decided to adopt it in working
up the case against Pattmore. After all, he would be the one against whom my efforts would
be directed, Mrs. Thayer being only an unconscious instrument in bringing him to justice. In
case it could be shown that he had actually attempted to murder his wife, I was determined
that he should not escape the swift vengeance of the law.

Just as I had concluded my deliberations, the Captain hurried into my office, the perspiration
standing in great beads on his forehead.

"Mr. Pinkerton, I fear we are too late!" he exclaimed in a husky voice. "Annie has just received
a telegram from Mr. Pattmore, saying that his wife is dead."

"Dead!" I repeated. "Is it possible! When did she die?"

"To-day," he replied.

"It will be an easy matter to discover the cause of her death," I said, after a moment's pause.
"We must have a post mortem examination held."

"That may be possible," replied the Captain; "but you must recollect that Pattmore has a great
many friends in Greenville; that, in fact, he is a prominent candidate for the Democratic Congressional
nomination; and, even if he were supposed to be guilty, the party would make a strong fight
to protect him, as they could not afford to have him exposed."

"Is it possible that he has so much influence as that?" I asked.

"Oh, yes," said the Captain; "he is a brilliant speaker, and a very agreeable man socially,
so that he makes many friends. He is such a wily scoundrel that I fear we shall have great
difficulty in tracing any crime directly to him. I do not care whether he is convicted or not,
provided I can rescue Annie from his clutches. He has apparently cast a spell over her, and
she is wholly controlled by him."

"If that is the fact, we must use strategy, and undermine his plot with a deeper one. I will
accept a retainer from you, Captain, and then we will proceed to work up the case."

The financial part of the arrangement having been adjusted, I gave the Captain some advice
as to what he should do. I told him that he must place implicit confidence in me, and not try
to interfere in any manner with my plans. If he could not do this, I should withdraw at once.
He must come in to see me often and keep me well informed; but he must not expect me to tell
him about my plans, any further than I should see fit. I should try to show Pattmore's villainous
character to Annie, and if I could gather sufficient evidence that he had poisoned his wife,
I should bring him to justice. I then told the Captain that he ought to have a quarrel with
Annie, at the end of which he should burn his will in her presence, and leave her; on going
out, he should tell her that he intended immediately to deposit his ready money in bank, and
make a will wholly in favor of Lucy. This would prevent Annie from again attempting his life,
as she would have nothing to gain by his death.

The Captain was satisfied to accept my conditions, and he said that he had full confidence
in my ability. All that he desired was to save Annie from the power of Pattmore, and from the
ruin which would inevitably result from their further intercourse. He then went home to have
his quarrel with his sister.

I determined to send a detective named Miller, to Greenville, to obtain board at the Pattmore
House, and, if possible, to become intimate with the proprietor. This part of my plan would
require prompt action, as Pattmore might succeed in removing all evidences of his guilt. I
therefore, sent for Mr. Miller, and went over all the facts of the case with him, giving him
full instructions as to his duties. He was to hail from Bangor, Maine, and to represent that
he wished to start in the lumber business in Greenville, if the prospects were good. I told
him to post himself thoroughly upon the qualities and prices of all kinds of lumber, lath,
shingles, etc., and to read up the local history of Bangor. To make matters easier for him,
I gave him a letter of introduction to a lumber dealer in Greenville, with whom I was well
acquainted. The next day, Miller was ready, and he took passage to Buffalo by steamer, going
thence to Greenville by rail. He then took a room at the Pattmore House, and soon became acquainted
with the proprietor.

The same day that I gave Miller his instructions, I sent for Miss Seaton, one of the detectives
in the female department, and ordered her to make arrangements to take board in the same house
with Captain Sumner and Mrs. Thayer. Miss Seaton was a brunette, about twenty-seven years of
age; she was of agreeable appearance and pleasing manners; she had been a school teacher, and
was a good judge of human nature. Mrs. Warne, the superintendent of the female department,
said that Miss Seaton was very sharp, and that nothing could escape her piercing black eye.
She was to cultivate Mrs. Thayer's acquaintance, and endeavor to win her confidence. This would
probably be a difficult task; but I told Miss Seaton to be patient and discreet, and not to
be discouraged, if she should not be immediately successful. By pretending to be in poor health,
she could obtain Mrs. Thayer's sympathy, and their progress toward intimacy would be accelerated.
Miss Seaton immediately moved to the City Hotel, whence she set out to look for a boarding
place. By a curious coincidence, she could not satisfy herself until she came to the house
where Mrs. Thayer was boarding on the North side. There she found a pleasant room adjoining
Mrs. Thayer's, and it suited her exactly. That evening at supper, she was introduced to her
fellow boarders, of whom there were only three besides the Captain and his sister.

The employment of female detectives has been the subject of some adverse criticism by persons
who think that women should not engage in such a dangerous calling. It has been claimed that
the work is unwomanly; that it is only performed by abandoned women; and that no respectable
woman who becomes a detective can remain virtuous. To these theories, which I regret to say
are quite prevalent, I enter a positive denial. My experience of twenty years with lady operatives
is worth something, and I have no hesitation in saying that the profession of a detective,
for a lady possessing the requisite characteristics, is as useful and honorable employment
as can be found in any walk of life.

Previous to the early part of 1855, I had never regularly employed any female detectives; nor
were women engaged in that capacity in any part of the Union. My first experience with them
was due to Mrs. Kate Warne, an intelligent, brilliant, and accomplished lady. She offered her
services to me in the early spring of that year, and, in spite of the novelty of her proposition,
I determined to give her a trial. She soon showed such tact, readiness of resource, ability
to read character, intuitive perception of motives, and rare discretion, that I created a female
department in the agency, and made Mrs. Warne the superintendent thereof.

The work of my female detectives is generally light. Zeal and discretion are the principal
requisites, though conscientious devotion to duty, and rigid obedience to orders, are also
essential. They are expected to win the confidence of those from whom information is desired,
and to lose no opportunity of encouraging them to talk about themselves.

With regard to the moral influence of their duties, I say boldly that it is in no respect different
from that of any other position where women are thrown upon their own resources. It is an unfortunate
fact in our social system, that no single woman or widow, dependent upon herself for support,
can escape a loss of caste and position by working in the great field of business where she
comes in competition and contact with men; but, aside from this general prejudice, there is
nothing in the detective's duties to make her profession less respectable and honorable than
there is in the duties of a lady cashier, book-keeper, copyist, or clerk. The detective's temptations
are no greater than those of any of the foregoing who mingle with men in their daily business;
while, on the other hand, the safeguards of their virtue are much more numerous, since all
the detectives of my agency know that their conduct is under constant surveillance.

There are instances of frequent occurrence where great criminals are successful in hiding all
traces of their guilt so effectually as to make their conviction impossible without the aid
of the female detective. Most of these men have wives or mistresses in whom they confide to
a great extent. The testimony of these women, then, become the sole means by which to convict
the criminals, and their testimony can be obtained in only one way--a female detective makes
their acquaintance, wins their confidence, and draws out the story of the crime. Such an instance
is given in "The Expressman and the Detective," hitherto published.

I have in my employ several ladies of unquestionable purity of life, who are also among the
most successful operators on my whole force. I take pleasure in offering this tribute to their
ability, and their spotless characters.

The next day the Captain called to see me, and said that, according to my advice, he had quarreled
with Annie about Pattmore, and had worked himself into a great rage. Finally, he had torn up
and burned his will, saying that he should immediately make another, leaving everything to Lucy.

"So far, so good," said I; "she now will have no motive for poisoning you, so you can rest
in peace."

The Captain stated further that he had deposited in bank a few hundred dollars which he had
brought with him, so that he felt comparatively safe for the present.

That evening Miss Seaton reported that Mrs. Thayer had left the house shortly after the Captain.
Miss Seaton had followed her to the post-office, where Mrs. Thayer had deposited a letter,
and had received another at the ladies' window. She had immediately torn it open, read it hastily,
and crumpled it in her hand, while slowly walking home. I was very anxious to know to whom
she had written, and also who had written to her. I immediately wrote to Miller to watch Pattmore's
mail, and to learn whether there were any letters in it from Chicago. If so, I wished him to
obtain a view of the handwriting, and, if possible, to get possession of the letters themselves
long enough to take copies of them.

The next morning Captain Sumner came in again, but he had nothing to report.

"Does Annie write much?" I asked.

"No, very little," he replied.

"Does she correspond with Lucy?"

"Sometimes, but not regularly."

"Did she not write a letter two days ago?" I inquired.

"No," answered the Captain; "but why do you ask?"

"Oh! for no particular reason; however I wish you would write to Lucy and inquire whether she
has received a letter from Annie lately; also whether she has written to Annie."

"Certainly, I will do so now," said the Captain, and, he straightway sat down to write to Lucy.

In a few days, the Captain received a letter from Lucy stating that no letters had passed between
her and Annie for over a month. This made it certain that Lucy was not Annie's correspondent.

Miller sent in a report about the same time, saying that he had become slightly acquainted
with Pattmore, who was deeply mourning the death of his wife. Even the mere mention of her
name was sufficient to draw tears to his eyes, and her loss had so severely affected him that
his friends were afraid he would never be the same man that he had been during her life.

Miller had expressed an intention of opening an office in Greenville, and Pattmore had given
him some valuable advice and information relative to the lumber market in the interior. Since
getting my letter, Miller had noticed that Pattmore had received four letters from Chicago.
Miller said that he had not been able to obtain possession of these letters, but he should
make a great effort to capture those which might come in the future. He had taken pains to
cultivate the friendship of the clerk of the hotel, and he was on such good terms with him
as to find it convenient to pass a great deal of time in the office. He had noticed that when
the clerk received the mail, all of Pattmore's letters were put into a particular box behind
the desk, and he hoped to be able to secure some of them.

I had devoted a large amount of thought to this singular case, and I finally decided that I
would go to Greenville in person. I determined to see the coroner and find out what kind of
a man he was. If possible, I should induce him to have Mrs. Pattmore's body exhumed and an
inquest held upon it.

I had previously written to Mr. Chapman to obtain further information about the Captain and
his family, and had mentioned his superstitious belief in the ring. I said that I was not afraid
of losing money, as the Captain offered me more than my usual scale of prices; but the Captain's
story and his great superstition led me to think that he was a "wee bit daft," and that there
was insanity in the family.

Mr. Chapman replied that he had known the Captain's father and mother intimately, but there
had been no sign of insanity in any of their actions. They had been, however, firm believers
in their rings, and had had the rings which they had worn buried with them. They had been clear-headed,
religious people, and it was surprising that they should have had such a superstitious faith
in the power of those opal rings. The Captain had always been an honorable, straight-forward
man, but he and his sister were even more superstitious than any of the others.

"Well," I thought, on reading Mr. Chapman's letter, "the whole family are a strange medley;
but I think I can turn their superstitious credulity to good account, in any efforts to learn
whether Pattmore poisoned his wife."

CHAPTER IV.

As soon as possible, I started for Greenville, to see the coroner; on my arrival, I was so
fortunate as to meet Mr. Wells, an old friend, who had formerly been sheriff of the county.
He offered to introduce me to his successor, Mr. Tomlinson, who had once been his deputy. Mr.
Wells was quite wealthy, and had retired from business. Mr. Tomlinson was an honest, hard working
carpenter, who was thoroughly reliable and zealous. Neither of these gentlemen, however, had
the shrewdness nor the experience necessary to detect criminals of the character and ability
of Pattmore. They were perfectly competent to attend to the small thieves and swindlers of
the district, but they were wholly ignorant and unsuspicious of the means by which daring and
skillful villains carry out their plans and hide the evidences of their crimes.

They knew Mr. Pattmore well, as he had resided in Greenville for seven years. They stated that
he was a scheming politician who could not be depended upon, and that he was trying to get
the Democratic Nomination for congressman. Probably, he would not succeed, but he was spending
money freely, and he would, therefore, be apt to get some good office. He was not wealthy,
but he kept his hotel well, and did a large business. Mr. Wells thought that he used all his
money as fast as he made it, either in trying to get votes, or in some other way outside of
his business. His wife had been generally esteemed by a large circle of acquaintances.

I told Mr. Tomlinson that I should like to see the coroner, and have him investigate the causes
of Mrs. Pattmore's death.

"Oh! that will be easy," he replied, "as I know Van Valkenburgh, the coroner, very well, and
we are on good terms. He is a warm friend of Pattmore,--in fact, they are boon companions.
He spends most of his time in idling about the Pattmore House, and only yesterday, they went
driving together."

"I am sorry to hear that," said I; "for he will not wish to do anything to injure his friend.
How can I get an inquest called?"

"I don't know," said Mr. Tomlinson.

"Suppose that I should make an affidavit under an assumed name and hand it to you, could you
not serve it on the coroner as a complaint which required his attention?" I asked.

"No; that would not do, as it would involve me in difficulty," replied the sheriff; "but if
I should hear people talking about the death of Mrs. Pattmore, and hinting at foul play, it
would be my duty to lay the matter before the coroner. Then he, as a friend of Pattmore, could
not do otherwise than order an inquest."

I determined to act on this suggestion, and I therefore telegraphed to Mr. Bangs, my General
Superintendent, directing him to send two of my detectives, Mr. Green and Mr. Knox, to meet
me at the Clarendon House in Greenville. They left Chicago by the next train, and when they
arrived in Greenville, I instructed them to go into the office of the hotel and begin a conversation
about Mrs. Pattmore's death; having told them what I wished them to say, I sent them in. I
had previously arranged that Mr. Tomlinson should be present. Accordingly, they took seats
in the main hall in front of the clerk's desk, near which there was a large group of guests
and citizens, and began to talk in loud tones.

"Well," said Knox, "there are more cases of death by poisoning than you would suppose. Now,
there was a case in this town, only a short time ago, in which I think that poison was used."

"Oh! you mean Mrs. Pattmore," said Green. "Yes, that was a very suspicious affair. Was anything
done about it?"

"No," replied Knox; "but every one, who knows anything about the circumstances of her death,
believes that she was poisoned."

My men were soon surrounded by an excited crowd, all of whom were anxious to know the grounds
upon which their suspicions were based. They replied in vague terms and insinuations, as if
they knew a great deal more than they would tell. The news that Mr. Pattmore was suspected
of having poisoned his wife, was soon buzzed all through the Clarendon House; and, as soon
as the excitement had become general, my men slipped away and joined me in my room.

Sheriff Tomlinson was immediately appealed to by many citizens to require the coroner to investigate
the matter, and he finally went to the coroner's office, accompanied by quite a crowd. When
the coroner was informed of the reports in circulation, he became quite indignant.

"What! Pattmore poison his wife!" he exclaimed. "Why, he fairly doted on her, and, since her
death, he can hardly assuage his grief. He is a gentleman in every sense of the word, and his
character ought to be a sufficient protection against so gross a slander. This is a contemptible
invention of his political opponents. I will soon vindicate him, however. I shall have Mrs.
Pattmore's body exhumed, and shall call an inquest. Then, if any one has any charges to make,
there will be an opportunity for them to come forward. I will not consent to see a friend of
mine so vilely slandered."

Coroner Van Valkenburgh immediately wrote an order to have Mrs. Pattmore's body disinterred,
and, also, a call for an inquest the following day. He had become very indignant at the idea
of connecting his friend, Pattmore, with such a hideous crime: he, therefore, hurried over
to tell Pattmore of the rumors, and of the prompt measures he had taken to prove their falsity.
He drew Pattmore into a private room and told him all that he had heard and done. He expected
that Pattmore would thank him heartily for his friendly action; but, instead, Pattmore's face
turned very white, and he asked who it was that had spread the rumors. The coroner said that
the sheriff and several prominent citizens had called upon him to investigate the rumors that
were circulating at the hotels and on the street. Pattmore became very much excited when he
heard this, and paced up and down in a nervous, irritable manner.

"Well," said Van Valkenburgh, "I will have the body exhumed to-morrow, and when we have disproved
the calumny, this scheme of your enemies will do you more good than harm."

"Yes," said Pattmore; "but my love for my wife is far above all other considerations. It is
shocking to think that her body must be torn from the grave to refute the vile slanders of
my political opponents. I do not know what course you usually pursue in such cases, but I would
not, for the world, have her remains exposed to the gaze of a cruel, heartless crowd of strangers."

Mr. Pattmore's feelings quite overcame him, at the thought of such desecration, and he wept.

"I'll take care of that," said the sympathizing coroner; "I will have Dr. Forsythe make the
examination, and his testimony will be sufficient for the jury."

"Well, I shall be satisfied with any arrangements you may make," said Pattmore. "I hope a good
jury will be summoned; I do not wish my wife's body to be examined by a lot of curiosity seekers."

"Your wishes shall be attended to," replied the coroner. "I know who are your friends and I
will summon no one else to sit on the jury."

"Van Valkenburgh," exclaimed Pattmore, seizing the coroner's hand, "I am your friend for life!"

He then led the way to the bar-room and invited the coroner to drink.

Miller was standing in the bar-room as the coroner and Pattmore passed, and noticing a haggard,
pallid expression on the latter's face, he stepped up and said:

"Why, what's the matter Pattmore? Has anything gone wrong with you?"

"No, Mr. Miller, nothing very serious. Some of my enemies have started a story that I am responsible
for my wife's death; but, of course, there is not a word of truth in it. The coroner has taken
the matter in charge, and his verdict will soon set at rest these scandalous lies. There is
nothing too sacred for these political harpies and ghouls: they literally have dragged the
loved dead from the grave in the hope of injuring my reputation. Well, time will show my innocence."

So saying, Pattmore pressed Miller's hand warmly, as if overcome with emotion, and passed into
the office. Mr. Green and Mr. Knox were watching him, and when he went up stairs, he was followed
by Knox, who saw him go into his room. Knox immediately came down stairs and passed across
the street to a corner where I had agreed to wait for him. Having heard his report I said:

"Mr. Knox, you are a stranger here, so you had better go back to see what Pattmore is doing.
You can stumble into his room, as if you had mistaken it for your own. Be quick!" I added,
as he started, "for we must keep watch of him every minute until the inquest has been held."

"Knox rushed into the hotel, ran up stairs and hastily entered Pattmore's room, where he found
Pattmore writing a letter.

"Oh! I beg pardon," said Knox, "I have mistaken the room," and so saying, he withdrew and returned
to me.

"So he is writing a letter, is he?" said I. "We must learn the contents of that letter, and
I have not a minute to lose. Knox, find Green and Miller and bring them over here at once.
Thank goodness, it is getting so dark that we shall not be noticed."

Knox was off like a shot, and in a very few minutes all my men were with me.

"Green," I said, "go to your hotel, pay your bill, and proceed to the Pattmore House. When
you register your name, you must hail the clerk as an old acquaintance. This will be an easy
matter, as hotel clerks are known by hundreds of people. Miller, you must be in the office
at the same time, and you must both remain there until Pattmore puts his letter in the mail-box.
Then, Green you must ask the clerk out to take a drink, and while you are gone, Miller must
get possession of the letter. When you have secured it, come over to the Globe Hotel, where
I am stopping."

Green hurried off to the Clarendon House to get his carpet-bag, and Miller returned to the
Pattmore House. I also sent Knox to watch Pattmore, and to follow him wherever he might go,
until he retired for the night.

Soon after Miller reached the office, Pattmore came down stairs with a letter, which Miller
carefully scrutinized, so as to be able to recognize it among a group of others.

"Has the mail for the West closed yet?" asked Pattmore.

"No," replied the clerk, "there is still about an hour to spare."

Pattmore then dropped his letter into the mail-box and went out. At this moment Green stepped
up to the desk, registered his name, and asked for a room. As the clerk was attending to his
room and baggage, Green looked intently at him, as if trying to recall his name. Then, stepping
forward, he said, cordially:

"Why, how are you? When did you come here? Let me see; the last time I saw you was at a hotel
in Buffalo, wasn't it?"

This was a lucky guess, for the clerk replied:

"Havn't you seen me since then? Why, I left there over a year ago."

"Well, I'm right glad to see you again," said Green; "step into the bar-room and take a 'smile'
with me."

"I can't very well leave the office just now," said the clerk.

"Oh, yes you can," said Green; "your friend there will look after the office for a few minutes;
come along."

"Wait here until I come back, will you?" the clerk asked Miller, as he went off with Green.

As soon as the clerk had left the office, Miller quietly extracted Pattmore's letter from the
box. He had marked its appearance so well that he only needed one glance to identify it and
he secured it so quickly that none of the crowd outside the desk noticed any movement on his
part. In a few minutes the clerk returned to the desk, and Miller lounged out into the bar-room,
whence he hurried over to meet me at the Globe Hotel. He there gave me the letter, which was
addressed:

                  "Mrs. Annie Thayer,
                            "Chicago,
                                "Illinois."

I carefully opened it by a simple process, which did not leave any evidence that the envelope
had been tampered with. The letter began: "My own dear Annie," and the writer went on to caution
Mrs. Thayer that she must not be alarmed at the news he was about to tell her. He said that
some of his enemies had started a report that he had poisoned his late wife. He had no doubt
that the Whig newspapers would spread and magnify these reports; still, he had no fears that
they would be of any permanent injury to him, since his friend, coroner Van Valkenburgh, had
agreed to hold an inquest, and there would be no difficulty in proving his innocence. He begged
her to excuse the haste and brevity of the note, as he only had time to dash off a few lines
to assure her that all was well, and to warn her not to become alarmed at anything she might
see in the newspapers. The letter was signed: "Ever your loving and devoted husband,

ALONZO PATTMORE."

"Well, this is certainly strange," I meditated. "Her 'devoted husband,' eh? How can that be?
He has had no opportunity to marry her since his wife died; hence, unless he committed bigamy,
this title of 'husband' is only assumed in anticipation; yet Mrs. Thayer is, undoubtedly, beautiful
and winning, and she may have induced him to ease her conscience by a form of marriage, even
while his legal wife still lived. I must look into this more closely on my return to Chicago."

I then re-sealed the letter and gave it back to Mr. Miller, with instructions to return to
the hotel and keep a general watch on all that went on. He was not to mail the letter until
early the next morning. As Miller went out Knox came in.

"Well, Knox, what news?" I asked.

"Mr. Pattmore has gone away in a hack," replied Knox, breathlessly.

"What direction did he take?"

"He drove off at a rapid rate toward the southern part of the town, and I could not keep up,
nor get on behind. I took the number of the hack, though," answered Knox.

"That was right," I remarked, as Knox paused to get his breath.

"It was number fifty-two, and the driver seemed to be an Irishman. He looked like a genial,
half-grown, young fellow, and I do not think I shall have any difficulty in pumping him when
he returns, as I know where his stand is."

"Right again," I exclaimed. "Now you had better wait around there until the hack returns; then
get into conversation with the driver, and ask him to take a drink in the nearest saloon; while
you are talking with him, you can easily learn where Pattmore went."

It was ten o'clock when Knox left me, and, as I was greatly fatigued, I went to bed immediately.
Shortly after midnight, Knox again awoke me.

"What news?" I asked, starting up. "Did you succeed in learning anything from the hackman?"

"Yes," replied Knox; "he returned a little before eleven o'clock, and I asked him whether he
knew where there were any young ladies I could visit. He said that he knew several places.
I then asked him to take a drink while we talked about it. I said, I judged, from his appearance,
that he was just the young fellow who could take me where I wanted to go; that I was crossing
the street to employ him in the early part of the evening, when he was taken by another gentleman,
who probably went to the same kind of a place that I wanted to find. This had confirmed my
opinion of the hackman, so I had decided to await his return. 'By the way,' I added, 'was I
right about that gentleman?' The driver laughed loudly, and said that that was Mr. Pattmore,
and that he did not go to such places. He went on to say that Mr. Pattmore's wife had been
dead only a few days, and he supposed that Mr. Pattmore had gone out to pay the grave-digger,
since his visit had been made to that individual at the graveyard gate."

"Did the boy say whether Pattmore saw the grave-digger?" I asked.

"Yes," continued Knox; "I pumped out all that the young fellow knew. The grave-digger lives
in a little shanty close by the graveyard, and, on arriving there, Pattmore called the fellow
to one side, and conversed with him in a low tone for some time. He then paid him some money,
entered the hack, and told the boy to drive straight back to the Pattmore House, where Pattmore
discharged the hackman. I drew this information out of the boy very easily, without appearing
to take any special interest in the story. I then told him to drive me to some quiet house
where I could meet some young ladies. He took me to a place near here, and I paid him off immediately,
saying that I should spend the night there. As soon as he was out of sight, I came straight
here, without going into the house at all."

"By Jove!" I exclaimed, "we shall have some rough work to-night, and we must be quick, too.
Go over to the Pattmore House, find out from the register what room Green is in, and wake him
up as soon as possible. Tell him to come here, being careful that no one notices him, and to
be sure to bring his pistols. You have yours, have you not, Mr. Knox?"

"Yes; do you expect to need them?"

"It is quite possible, as we shall have some risky work to-night. I will meet you outside,
and you must tell Green to prepare for a march. Luckily we are all good walkers."

Knox hurried away, and, in a short time, both of my detectives joined me in the street. We
then hired a hack and drove to within half a mile of the graveyard, where I paid off the hackman,
and we entered the grounds of a residence, standing some distance back from the road. My object
in entering these grounds, was to make the hackman believe we were stopping there; otherwise,
his curiosity would have been excited as to my reasons for going into the country at that hour
of the night. As soon as the hack was out of sight, we returned to the highway, and, after
a brisk walk, we reached the graveyard.

CHAPTER V.

The resting places of the dead are localities which I do not much care to visit in the night.
In the day time it is different; there is a holy calm about a cemetery then which impresses
me with a feeling of rest, and I can really enjoy an hour or two in quiet contemplation of

"I will undertake it," she said, decidedly, after a moment's thought; "I will make it a success,
too, if you will give me my own way about it."

"All right," I answered; "success is all that I require."

Mrs. Warne then withdrew to make her preparations.

In a day or two I received a letter from Miller. He said that the talk over the inquest was
gradually subsiding; that there were some few persons who were not fully satisfied with the
manner of conducting the inquiry, but that the general effect had been favorable to Pattmore;
that the latter had began to drink a great deal, though not enough to become intoxicated; that
he, (Miller,) had been taken into Pattmore's confidence to a considerable extent; and that
the latter had expressed an intention of going to Cincinnati to make a visit. In conclusion,
he said that Pattmore was doing his utmost to appear cheerful, but that he looked very haggard,
and seemed to be in great trouble.

Miss Seaton reported to Mrs. Warne the same day, that she was becoming more intimate with Mrs.
Thayer, though the latter manifested no desire to take any one into her confidence. The day
previous Mrs. Thayer had gone to the post-office, where she had received a letter, as usual.
She had torn it open, as if very anxious to learn the news it contained for her, and had then
crumpled it nervously in her hand, after reading it.

Miss Seaton also described a scene which had taken place that morning. Mrs. Thayer was in her
room about eleven o'clock; soon afterward Miss Seaton went to the door and knocked. No answer
being given, she went in quietly, intending to surprise Mrs. Thayer. She found the latter deeply
absorbed in telling her own fortune with a pack of cards. Miss Seaton laughed pleasantly, and said:

"So you were telling your fortune, were you? Well, how did it come out?"

Mrs. Thayer looked somewhat confused at first, but she gathered up the cards mechanically,
and said:

"I don't know how to tell my fortune; do you?"

"Yes, indeed, I used to be a splendid fortune-teller," replied Miss Seaton. "Let me try to
tell your fortune."

She then shuffled the cards, dealt them in three piles, and turned up the last card, which
happened to be the queen of hearts.

"Now let us see what your fortune has been, what it is, and what it will be," said Miss Seaton.
"You are represented by the queen of hearts; this pile contains your past; that one your present;
and the third your future."

So saying, she turned up the top card of each pile. By an odd coincidence the present and future
were both clubs, the past being a diamond.

Miss Seaton said, gravely:

"Your past has been pleasant, but your future is unpromising."

"Yes, it is always so," replied Mrs. Thayer, despondently.

Then, as Miss Seaton was about to go on, Mrs. Thayer threw all the cards into a heap, saying:

"No, I don't want to hear any more; I shall have the same luck throughout; clubs always come
to me."

"Have you always had such bad fortune?" asked Miss Seaton.

"Oh! no; only a few years ago, I used to be as happy as a bird; sorrow was unknown to me, and
one enjoyment seemed to pass away only to be succeeded by another. Now I have nothing but trouble
all the time."

"Your lot seems hard," remarked Miss Seaton, in a sympathizing tone; "probably you feel worse
since your husband has been dead."

"Dead!" exclaimed Mrs. Thayer, springing up; then, recovering her presence of mind, she sat
down, muttering: "yes, yes, of course, he's dead."

"What do you mean?" said Miss Seaton. "Is it long since he died?"

"I do not feel well to-day; and I shall not try to read my fortune again when I am so nervous,"
replied Mrs. Thayer, evading Miss Seaton's question.

Seeing that Mrs. Thayer wished to change the subject, Miss Seaton did not press her further.
The two ladies remained together until dinner time, and Miss Seaton read a portion of "Eugene
Aram" aloud. Mrs. Thayer became deeply interested in the book, and borrowed it to read.

Next morning I received a telegram from Miller, briefly stating that Pattmore had left Greenville.
His destination was Chicago, though he had given out that he was going to Cincinnati.

I knew that he could not arrive that day, as the railroad connections were not promptly made
at that time; but I instructed Mr. Knox and Mr. Green to be prepared to "shadow" him, on his
arrival at the depot the next morning, and to keep upon his track constantly, while he remained
in Chicago. I also sent word to Miss Seaton to make some pretense for calling upon Mrs. Thayer
early in the forenoon, and to remain with her as long as possible. I knew that Pattmore would
communicate with Mrs. Thayer immediately on his arrival, and my object was, to have some one
to witness their meeting.

On entering my office early the next day, I was surprised to find Captain Sumner awaiting me,
in a great state of excitement.

"That man has come here again, Mr. Pinkerton," he broke out, impetuously. "He came before breakfast
and went straight to Annie's room. I called her to the door and expostulated with her, until
she agreed to send him away as soon as possible. I then came here directly to inform you."

"Quite right, Captain," I replied; "there is nothing like taking prompt action in such cases.
You can return to the house now, and trust to me for the rest."

"But I'm afraid she will run away with that villain," said the Captain.

"Of course, we must prevent that," I replied; "I shall have a plan prepared, in case they attempt
to run away together; but, I do not think Pattmore is quite ready yet for such a step. Keep
your spirits up, Captain, and don't borrow trouble."

"I have all confidence in you, Mr. Pinkerton," he said as he went out; "but I shall be much
happier when I am back on my farm."

According to instructions, Miss Seaton called on Mrs. Thayer, though she did not gain admittance
to her room. When Mrs. Thayer opened the door, Miss Seaton saw that she had been crying, and
that she was evidently much disturbed. She asked Miss Seaton to excuse her, as she had company
from the East.

About noon Pattmore returned to his hotel, as the Captain would not permit him to dine at the
boarding house. As Mrs. Thayer did not come down to dinner, Miss Seaton again visited her,
and found her dressing to go out. She asked Miss Seaton to remain until she was dressed, but
said that she was going out driving in the afternoon and to the theatre in the evening. In
a short time, the Captain came in, and Miss Seaton retired. The Captain asked Mrs. Thayer what
she meant by breaking her promises not to see Pattmore again.

She replied that Pattmore was a man she could not help loving; that she had tried her best
to overcome her passion, but in vain; and that she could not break off the connection so abruptly,
but that she would endeavor to do so gradually in the future. Then she kissed the Captain,
saying that she was never so happy in her life, and that she was going out driving with Pattmore
that afternoon. The Captain remonstrated with her without effect, and, seeing that he could
not move her from her purpose he came straight to my office to report.

Pattmore came again in the afternoon and took Mrs. Thayer out driving. She looked superb as
she went off, having recovered entirely from her illness. She was in a perfect flutter of happiness
and excitement, which gave her a brilliant color, and added to the brightness of her eyes.
She was agitated by conflicting influences; on one side, was her brother, determined to separate
her from her lover, and justly blaming her course; on the other, was Pattmore, claiming her
love, and urging her to abandon her brother's protection.

They were gone about three hours, and, on their return, they seemed very complacent and much
less excited than when they set out. In the evening, they went to the theatre together, being
"shadowed" by Mr. Knox. He took a seat close behind them, in order to listen to their conversation;
but he overheard nothing of any consequence.

Captain Sumner had a long talk with his sister next morning, in relation to their return to
Connecticut. He begged her to go immediately, and thus escape from Pattmore's influence; but
she opposed his wish, on the ground that she was too weak to make the journey. He then lost
his temper, and replied that she was strong enough to go around to places of amusement with
Pattmore, and it was very strange that she could not travel slowly home. This show of anger
on the Captain's part, caused her to commence crying, as she knew that he could not resist
so powerful an appeal to his sympathy. The result equalled her anticipations. The Captain soon
lost all his irritation and began to console her, as if she were a spoilt child; finally, she
induced him to go driving with them that afternoon. The Captain told me afterward, that Pattmore
behaved with great propriety during the drive, and that they did not seem to be so much in
love with each other as he had supposed. I smiled inwardly at the old sailor's simplicity;
for I noticed that they had gone out in an open barouche, (instead of a close carriage, such
as they had used the day before,) and they had remained away only one hour, instead of three.

On their return from the drive, Pattmore and Annie went to Mrs. Thayer's sitting room, and
the Captain went down town. At four o'clock, Miss Seaton knocked at Mrs. Thayer's door; but,
receiving no answer, she tried to enter quietly. She found that the door was locked on the
inside, however, and she was, therefore, obliged to withdraw to her own room to watch. It was
six o'clock before Pattmore came out, having been nearly three hours in Mrs. Thayer's room
with the door locked.

Mr. Knox "shadowed" Pattmore on his departure from the boarding house, and saw him take the
nine o'clock train for Greenville. I immediately notified Mr. Miller by telegraph, directing
him to renew his intimacy with Pattmore, and to remain in Greenville until further orders.

CHAPTER VII.

Mr. Miller was not idle during the time that Pattmore was away. His first action was to learn
who were the nurses attending Mrs. Pattmore in her last illness. One of them had left the city,
but the other, being an old resident of Greenville, was soon found. She was quite an elderly
woman, with no family except one daughter. The latter was a seamstress, and Mr. Miller soon
made her acquaintance by employing her to make some shirts for him. He kept up friendly relations
with them by taking both mother and daughter out riding occasionally in the summer evenings;
and in various ways he ingratiated himself into the old lady's confidence. It was not long
before he was able to draw out all the particulars of Mrs. Pattmore's illness.

He learned that when she first became seriously sick, Mr. Pattmore began to show a very tender
solicitude for her health.

He even insisted upon preparing her medicine and giving it to her himself. Mrs. Pattmore, however,
did not seem to appreciate his watchful care, for she told the nurse that she did not like
to take her medicine from her husband; she also asked very particularly whether the medicine
which she took was that which the doctor prescribed.

Mrs. Reed, the nurse, said that she did not like the effects of the medicine at all. It was
put up in small yellow papers, and when Mrs. Pattmore took a dose of it she was always taken
with violent vomiting; her bowels and stomach would become very hot, and the pain would be
so severe as to cause her to scream terribly. Then Mr. Pattmore would give her a dose of another
kind of medicine, which would soon relieve the patient and cause her to fall into a deep sleep.

When Dr. Forsythe called, Mrs. Pattmore always informed him very carefully about the effect
of the medicine, but he treated it as a case of common occurrence, and said that those symptoms
invariably accompanied an attack of dysentery. After the Doctor had gone, Mr. Pattmore would
return to the room with the same medicine, and his wife would exclaim:

"Oh! has the Doctor ordered that horrid medicine again? I cannot stand it long. Oh! what shall
I do?"

Then her husband would tell her that it pained him almost as much as herself to see her suffer
so, and that he would willingly take it himself if he could thereby save her from pain; but
she must recollect that she was very dangerously sick, and that a failure to obey the Doctor's
instructions might prove fatal to her. Mrs. Pattmore would be too feeble to protest long, and
she would take the medicine; the same symptoms as before would then result, and each day she
seemed to grow weaker and weaker.

The day of Mrs. Pattmore's death the Doctor was unable to call; hence only Mr. Pattmore and
Mrs. Reed were present when she died. Pattmore spoke very endearingly to his wife and tried
to caress her, but she pushed him away, gave him one long, reproachful look, and fell back
dead. Pattmore professed to be overcome with grief, and tears flowed down his cheeks, as he
requested Mrs. Reed to arrange for the funeral, and to spare no expense. He stopped at the
door as he was leaving the room and said:

"By the way, Mrs. Reed, if any one inquires about it, you can say that dysentery was the cause
of my beloved wife's death."

Miller said that there was little doubt that Mrs. Reed suspected foul play in connection with
Mrs. Pattmore's death; but she was a very discreet woman, and would not spread any story which
she could not prove. It was only by very skillful management that he had been able to induce
her to talk upon the subject at all. She knew that Pattmore was very popular, and that she
would be speedily silenced if she attempted to suggest anything against his character; hence
she preferred to keep her suspicions to herself.

On receiving this report from Miller, I sent him instructions to continue his acquaintance
with Mrs. Reed, and to keep a close watch upon her movements, for it was possible that she,
too, might be induced to go away. As she would be an important witness, it would be necessary
not to lose sight of her. At the end of the week I received another report from Miller, stating
that Pattmore had called a select meeting of his political supporters in the district, and
had laid the plans for an energetic effort to obtain the Congressional nomination. Miller had
been taken into their confidence, and he was working hard to secure the election of Pattmore
delegates to the approaching convention. This gave him ample opportunity to become intimate
with Pattmore, and he felt sure that the latter would not take any important steps without
consulting him.

I was much pleased to hear this news, as it showed me that Pattmore was no longer in fear of
detection; moreover, it satisfied me that politics would detain him in Greenville for some
time, and there would be no immediate danger of his marriage with Mrs. Thayer. Having a prospect
that he would not return to Chicago to interfere with my plan for some weeks, I decided to
proceed with my attack on Mrs. Thayer's credulity and superstition. In the afternoon, therefore,
I sent for Mrs. Warne, and asked whether she had secured rooms in which to play the part of
a fortune-teller.

"Yes," she replied, "I have rented three rooms on Clark street, which are just suited for the
purpose. There are two entrances, so that you can slip in at any time without being seen by
my visitors."

"Well, you had better have them fitted up as soon as possible. I will drop in to look at them
to-day."

"No," she answered, "I don't wish you to come until I have completed my preparations. The rooms
are on the second floor, and have not been occupied for some time; hence they will need considerable
cleaning. You are too busy to attend to the furnishing and arranging, so I will relieve you
of all the trouble; only give me carte-blanche for the purpose of furnishing the rooms, and
I know you will not regret it."

"All right," said I; "you have my permission to do as you please, and you can get whatever
money you need from the cashier. All I ask is that everything be done in the best manner. When
you are ready to begin operations let me know, so that I can have an audience with the great
fortune-teller in advance of the general public."

During the next four days, nothing of any consequence occurred. The Captain reported that his
sister was gaining so fast in health and strength that he thought she was able to go back to
Connecticut. Of course, I was obliged to oppose the journey at that time, since I wished to
bring Mrs. Thayer before my fortune-teller. Miss Seaton reported that she was on quite intimate
terms with Mrs. Thayer; but the latter never talked about her own affairs. She wrote daily
to Pattmore, and received daily letters in reply.

At length, Mrs. Warne reported that her temple of magic was in complete order, and that she
would be ready to receive me that afternoon.

"Very well," I replied; "I will drop in to have my fortune told about three o'clock. Have you
arranged it wholly to your own satisfaction?"

"Yes; it is nearly perfect."

"Whom have you engaged for an usher?" I inquired.

"You must not ask questions now," she answered, laughing. "I have taken more liberties than
I ever dared to take before; but I think, when you consider the object to be gained, that you
will be satisfied."

"Well, I hope your rooms are as mysterious as your answers would lead me to expect," said I.
"However, I shall be there promptly at three o'clock, so I will restrain my curiosity for the
present."

At the appointed hour, therefore, I called at the rooms, where I was received by a young negro
of the blackest type. He was dressed in full Turkish costume, and his actions gave me the impression
that he was dumb. This black mute first ushered me into a very large front room, elegantly
furnished in the style of a modern salon. Heavy curtains hung in graceful folds from richly
gilded cornices, sufficiently obscuring the windows to prevent the strong glare of the afternoon
sun from penetrating directly into the room; arm-chairs and sofas were plentifully scattered
about, to accommodate the throng of persons who were expected to visit the fortune-teller;
the walls were hung with engravings and paintings; and on the floor was a thick Brussels carpet
into which my feet sank noiselessly, as I walked about inspecting the pictures and furniture.
After scanning the sable usher for a few minutes, I said:

"Now, if that color would wash off, I should feel sure of finding one of my office boys, named
Jack Scott, underneath." The mute grinned responsively, and I saw that I had guessed correctly.
"Well, Jack," I continued, "I don't think you need fear detection. Where is Mrs. Warne?"

Jack still remained mute; but he went into another room, and soon beckoned me to follow him.
As I crossed the threshold, the door closed noiselessly behind me. It took me several seconds
to accustom my eyes to the change in the light. Then I began to gather an idea of the surroundings,
and my surprise at Mrs. Warne's success was equalled only by my admiration of her good taste
and judgment.

The room was nearly square, but a large mirror, at the end opposite the entrance, gave a duplicate
view of the whole; the shape of the mirror being that of a large doorway, the effect was to
give an appearance of two rooms, instead of one. The walls and windows were hung with some
dark colored material, which wholly shut out every ray of sunlight; but a soft, dim radiance
was shed from five swinging lamps, one in each corner and the fifth in the centre of the room.
These lamps were of bronzed silver, of Oriental patterns, and were all in motion; the corner
lamps swinging back and forth toward the centre, and the centre one, swinging slowly around
in a circle. On the walls, were hung several charts and mystic symbols, while the floor was
covered with a close matting of white straw, upon which was painted the common representation
of the signs of the zodiac. A number of small globes stood upon a low shelf in one corner,
and on a table in the centre of the room was a large globe standing on a chart. With the exception
of one large easy-chair and a lounge, there were no other articles of furniture in the room.
A pair of skeletons stood facing each other, one at each side of the mirror, and their ghastly
appearance, duplicated in the mirror, added to the unnatural effect. Near the table was a small
portable furnace upon which stood a peculiarly shaped retort, and from this, issued a pungent,
aromatic incense.

While I was examining the globe and chart, Mrs. Warne slipped into the room, through the folds
of a curtain at one side of the mirror, and swept down toward me. I should hardly have known
her, so great was her disguise; her face and hands were stained a clear olive, and her hair
hung down in heavy masses to her waist; her dress was of rich material, trimmed with Oriental
extravagance; the sleeves were large and flowing, and the skirt trailed over a yard. In her
right hand she carried a small wand, around which two serpents twined. Her whole appearance
was dignified and imposing. The light and atmosphere added to the general effect, and I felt
wholly satisfied with Mrs. Warne's work.

"Well, Mrs. Warne," said I, "you have certainly made a great success; but I am afraid I shall
not be so much pleased when the bills come in."

"Don't be very much alarmed on that score," replied Mrs. Warne. "I have been very economical.
Many of the most expensive articles have been hired for the occasion, while the rest have been
picked up cheap at auction sales. The expense, I assure you, will not be great."

"All right," I rejoined; "the Captain will have to foot the bill, whatever it may be; but,
if we succeed in our object, he will not have any reason to regret the cost."

Mrs. Warne showed me the door through which she had entered, and asked me to seat myself behind
the curtains. She then called her usher into the room, and conversed with him; though they
spoke in low tones, I was able to hear every word. The door where I was sitting, was hung on
noiseless hinges, and it led into the last room of the suite; from this room, another door
opened on a hall leading to a pair of side stairs. I was thus able to reach my ambush without
entering by the front way.

"Now, Mrs. Warne, nothing remains to be done but to advertise you thoroughly," I said, after
I had inspected all her preparations.

"Very well," she replied; "but you must recollect that I shall not be able to oversee all my
general work, unless you make my office hours as a fortune-teller very short. Three hours will
be the longest time I can spare daily."

I then returned to my office and wrote out the following advertisement:

                 THE GREAT ASIATIC SIBYL,
     L. L. LUCILLE, the only living descendant of Hermes,
       the Egyptian, who has traveled through all the
         known parts of the world, now makes her first
           appearance in Chicago. She will cast
             the horoscope of all callers; will
               tell them the events of their
                 past life, and reveal what
                   the future has in store
                     for them. She has

This advertisement was inserted in the daily newspapers for a week, and I also had a number
of small handbills printed for distribution in the street. In this way Lucille's name was brought
before the public very conspicuously. At that time the trade of fortune-telling was not so
common as it is now, and those engaged in it rarely had the means to advertise themselves so
extensively; hence Lucille's half column in the newspapers attracted an unusual amount of attention.

CHAPTER VIII.

The next morning Miss Seaton called on Mrs. Thayer as usual, and found her eagerly reading
Lucille's advertisement in one of the newspapers. Alpinist is now, me must have profoundly complex

proceeds were feared from ring, and say he went from cataphyll.
 I therefore begged Lucille to give him a full sitting, and to read his past for
him very thoroughly.

"By the way," I added, "you recollect that while he was away at sea, his sweetheart, Miss Curtis,
married a wealthy New York banker, named Agnew. Well, I saw a notice the other day of the death
of a banker of that name in New York, and I feel sure that his old flame is now a widow. I
want you to refer to this fact in telling his future."

"Oh! well," said Lucille, with some vexation, "I'm rather tired of the business already, and
I don't care to spend the whole afternoon in that hot room; so I shall get rid of him as soon
as he is satisfied. If you want to tell me anything, make a sound like the gnawing of a rat,
and I will come out."

Accordingly, I resumed my place at the door, with my stenographer close beside me, and the
Captain was ushered into Lucille's room. She motioned to him to be seated, and then asked,
in her most commanding tones:

"What can you learn from Lucille that you have not already learned from the Hindoo or Calcutta?"

The Captain regarded her for an instant in reverent amazement; but, finally, he said:

"I see that you know my past, and that you are truly one of those who can read the fate of
others. I am in trouble, and I wish to know when I shall escape from it, if ever. The Hindoo
told me much, but I would know more."

Without further conversation, except to ask the day and hour of his birth, Lucille proceeded
to pore over a chart and to examine his hand. Finally, she gazed at him steadily a few minutes,
and said:

"What I have to say is the truth alone; if it be painful to you, it is because the truth is
not always pleasant. Listen calmly, therefore, to the words which the stars declare to be true:
Your parents are both dead; your father was a sea-captain, and he brought you up in the same
profession. On one of his cruises, a Sepoy presented him with three rings, one of which you
now wear; its powers are very great, and it has frequently rendered you important services;
take care that you lose it not. It has even saved your life. Yes," she continued, after closely
examining the palm of his left hand; "your life has been attempted three separate times lately.
You have two sisters living; one of them is happily married and lives in comfort in an eastern
State; the other married a sea-captain, but she does not live with her husband. She is with
you, and is in poor health. Why! is it possible!" she exclaimed, suddenly. "It was your sister
who made the attempt on your life! You may not suspect that your young and charming sister,
whom you so deeply love, could have been guilty of such an act; but, unless my powers have
failed me so that I cannot read the stars aright, such is the fact. Wait; lest I should have
made a mistake, I will try again. It seems too horrible to be believed."

The Captain had buried his face in his hands; but now he looked up and said:

"It is unnecessary to try again; you are right. I see that you are one of the gifted ones of
this world, and I wish you to tell me all; I can bear it."

Lucille continued her examination of the Captain's hand as she went on speaking:

"Your sister still has the same kind of poison with her which she used before. She does not
intend to use it herself--she has no motive for committing suicide; but she may intend to give
it to you again. You must be careful, for that is your greatest danger. Your principal trouble
for some time has been caused by that sister. She no longer loves her husband, who has wholly
disappeared from your knowledge, and she professes to believe that he is dead. This is not
the case, however: he is now in command of an English whaling ship in the South Sea, and he
will soon return to England."

At this, the Captain sprang up in a whirl of excitement and joy. In relating the story to me
the next day, he said that he felt like taking Lucille in his arms and giving her a genuine
sailor hug; but she looked so fierce and wicked that he got the idea that she was a genuine
witch; and he was afraid that her beautiful white hands would turn into claws, and that she
would soon make a meal of him, if she felt so disposed.

When he sat down again, Lucille again scanned the chart and compared it with his hand. She
seemed very much disturbed at the revelations, and, at length, she said:

"Your troubles are so closely interwoven with those of your sister that I cannot separate them;
but I never saw a horoscope so full of frightful scenes--I do not wish to go on with it."

"Please do not stop," said the Captain; "I feel that you have the power to tell me all, and
I must know it. I will pay you anything you ask," he added, taking out a roll of money.

"My fees are invariable," said Lucille, drawing herself up haughtily. "You insult me by suggesting
that I need to be paid extra to tell the truth."

"I beg your pardon," replied the Captain excitedly; "but I hope you will not refuse to tell
me all you know. I can bear it, I assure you."

"Know then that your sister is deeply in love with a very bad man, who lives two or three hundred
miles from here. She became acquainted with him in the East and he seduced her, though he was
a married man, living with his lawful wife. To quiet your sister's scruples, he had a marriage
ceremony performed; but, of course, it had no legal value, since both of the parties were already
married. She became enceinte by this man, and she caused the premature removal of the evidence
of her shame by an abortion. This crime you connived at, though you did not advise it. But
the worst is not yet told: this wicked man, finding that you were determined to prevent him
from seeing your sister, resolved to murder his wife, and to marry your sister legally, supposing
that her husband was dead. He accomplished part of his design by poisoning his wife; but he
has not yet been able to carry out the whole of his plan. He is now in danger, but he knows
it not. He will soon be arrested and tried for murder. If you can succeed in uniting your sister
and her lawful husband, they may be able to forget the past and live together happily. All,
however, depends upon her. At present she is in deep distress, but the effect of it will be
good for her. There is a strong hope that she may be led to see the character of her wicked
lover in its true light, and that she may return penitently to the arms of her husband, if
he will receive her."

"Oh! he will, I know he will," said the Captain.

"Then, when that happens, your troubles will be at an end. Now I can tell you but little more,
as I have a great task to perform, and I must be left alone."

On hearing Lucille say this, I immediately gave the signal, as agreed, and she made an excuse
to leave the room for a moment.

"What more do you want?" she asked.

"You have forgotten to tell him about his old sweetheart, Mrs. Agnew."

"Oh! let me skip that," said Lucille impatiently, "I am nearly exhausted, and I cannot stand
the atmosphere of that room much longer."

"Just tell the Captain about Mrs. Agnew, and then you will be through work for the day. Try
to send him off happy," I pleaded.

"Oh! yes; that is always the way: provided the Captain goes away happy, you don't care what
becomes of me. Well, I suppose I must; but I will never undertake such a role again."

When Lucille returned to the Captain, he was sitting with his face buried in his hands; but
he looked up instantly and asked whether she had anything more to tell him.

She looked at the chart for a few minutes and then said:

"In your youth, you loved a lady of great beauty, and she returned your love; but while you
were away at sea, her parents made her believe that you were false to her. They wished her
to marry a wealthy banker, and, in a fit of pique, she accepted him. She has always loved you
in secret, however, and now that her husband is dead--"

"Is that so?" ejaculated the Captain, springing up in great delight.

"Yes," replied Lucille; "he died a short time ago, and she is now passing her widowhood in
New York. She is stouter than she was, but she is still handsome, and she has never ceased
to love you. This completes the reading of your horoscope."

The Captain rose to go, but paused to express his feelings. He spoke slowly and with great
emotion, since Lucille had completely secured his confidence.

"Madam, I thank you from my heart for the revelations you have made to me. I know that most
of the things you have told me are true, and I am satisfied of the truth of the rest also.
I should like to pay you in proportion to the value of your words to me." So saying he went
out quickly, leaving one hundred dollars on the table.

I found that Lucille's fame was becoming uncomfortably great, since the reception-room was
thronged with eager inquirers, who insisted on seeing her, even after the close of her office
hours. I, therefore, arranged with Mr. Bangs, my general superintendent, to have a crowd of
my own employees constantly in attendance, so that outsiders, seeing so many others waiting
for an audience, would not remain. By this means, Lucille was able thereafter, to receive as
many, or as few, as she chose, and her labors were greatly lightened.

CHAPTER X.

After the interview with Lucille, Mrs. Thayer returned to her boarding-house with Miss Seaton,
and invited the latter to spend the day with her. She said that she was low-spirited and wanted
company to keep off the "blues." She was very nervous, and she could not take an interest in
anything. She said several times that Lucille was the most wonderful person she had ever met,
and that she had heard things which convinced her of Lucille's supernatural powers; but she
carefully avoided stating anything definite relative to the revelations made to her. Finally
she commenced to write a long letter, and Miss Seaton became absorbed in a novel.

After some time the Captain came in, looking very solemn, and Miss Seaton saw that he wished
to have a private talk with Mrs. Thayer. Accordingly she rose to leave the room, remarking
that she was going down town in the evening and would like to have Mrs. Thayer accompany her.
Miss Seaton knew that it was very improbable that Mrs. Thayer would go, on account of the fatigue
and excitement of the morning; but she hoped that the latter would give her the letter to put
in the post-office. On hearing the approach of the Captain, Mrs. Thayer had hastily concealed
her writing materials, thus showing that she was writing to Pattmore. On entering her own room,
Miss Seaton took a seat close by a door which connected the two rooms. This door was nailed
up and the cracks had been filled with cotton; but she quickly pulled out the filling and obtained
an excellent opening to hear all the conversation in the next room.

The Captain first asked his sister when she would be ready to return to Springfield with him.
She replied that she would go as soon as she felt able to stand the journey.

"Annie," said he, in an impressive manner, "I fear that you are deceiving me, and that you
intend to do me harm. Why do you seek my life? You know that I have done all I could for you,
and that I will continue to do so. Why, then, do you wish to poison me? I know that you have
poison with you, and that I am the only one for whom it can be intended."

"No, no, you are wrong," replied Mrs. Thayer, in trembling tones; "you are my brother, and
why should I wish to injure you?"

"Annie, I know that you have poison about you," said the Captain, firmly, "and I am afraid
to remain with you any longer. I have forgiven you once, but now it is my duty to cast you
off; you are plotting to take my life."

"Who told you this? What reason have I given you for thinking so?" demanded Mrs. Thayer.

"I have been to see a wonderful fortune-teller, who----"

The words had no more than passed her lips, when he was interrupted by an exclamation of terror
and surprise from Mrs. Thayer, who started to her feet and then fell back upon the sofa, fainting.
The Captain was much alarmed at the effect of his remark, and he could not understand why she
had fainted at the mere mention of the source of his information. However, he did not spend
any time in trying to account for her terror; his first action was to bathe her temples with
cold water, in order to restore her to consciousness. When she had partly revived, she lay
on the sofa with her eyes closed, as if she had no strength left. Finally she spoke in a weak
voice, without looking at her brother:

"Was it a fortune-teller who told you what you have just accused me of?"

"Yes," replied the Captain, "and I know that she speaks the truth."

"My God!" exclaimed Mrs. Thayer, "how could that woman have known that? Well, it is true that
I have some poison, though, as God is my judge, it was not meant for you; but, I was resolved
that if I could not escape from my present misery, I would take it myself. Never, for an instant,
did I intend it for you."

"In either case, Annie, I must have the poison."

Mrs. Thayer rose with great effort, and, going to her trunk, produced a small package labeled
"POISON," in conspicuous letters. She handed it to the Captain, and he said:

"I will now destroy this package and thus remove all temptation from you; let us both thank
God that you have been prevented from carrying out your design. O, Annie! may this be the last
time that I ever shall have reason to doubt you. The fortune-teller whom I mentioned is a wonderful
woman. I learned from her many things which I will tell you when you are strong enough to hear
them."

"I should like you to tell me very much," said Mrs. Thayer, eagerly; "perhaps she could tell
my fortune, if I should visit her."

"Yes, indeed; she could tell you all your past and future; you ought to go there."

"Well, I guess I will try to go to-morrow, if I am strong enough," said Mrs. Thayer.

The Captain kissed her tenderly, and said:

"Annie, never again follow the advice of an evil counsellor; you will never be happy while
you continue in a path which you know to be wrong. The fortune-teller had good news for us
both, and all will go well if you will only be guided by the wishes of your true friends, who
love you and who desire to save you from sorrow."

The Captain then went out and left Mrs. Thayer dozing on the sofa.

In the evening, after supper, Miss Seaton went to Mrs. Thayer's room to see whether the latter
wished to take a walk. Mrs. Thayer was not able to go out, but she asked Miss Seaton to put
a letter in the post-office for her. Miss Seaton took the letter and brought it straight to
Mrs. Warne, who delivered it to me at once. I opened it and read it aloud to my stenographer,
who took down its contents as fast as the words fell from my lips.

The letter contained a full account of Mrs. Thayer's second visit to Lucille, and it betrayed
great fear of discovery and punishment. She said that she had thought their secret to be perfectly
safe, but now she knew that there was at least one person who could disclose their guilt to
the world, since that person had the power of finding out everything. She begged him to come
to Chicago, to see Lucille, and have his fortune told; he would then learn the wonderful extent
of her powers, and would be able to decide what was the best course to pursue. She thought
he ought to fly for safety at once, since the fortune-teller predicted that he was in great
danger. As for herself, she expected to go East soon, as her brother was anxious to start.
If Pattmore did not come to Chicago immediately she might never see him again; she could not
bear the idea of separation, but she knew that it must come. It was evident that Mrs. Thayer
had wholly forgotten Lucille's injunction to maintain silence upon the subject of her revelations,
and I debated an instant whether I should send the letter; but I finally decided to let it
go, as he would receive it too late to interfere with my plans, even if he should come to Chicago.
I sent a letter to Miller by the same mail, telling him to keep a strict watch on Pattmore,
as I feared that he might leave Greenville suddenly. In case of such a movement Miller must
telegraph to me instantly.

Miller's reports for several days had been to the effect that Pattmore was working very hard
to secure the Congressional nomination, but that he seemed very much troubled about some other
matter. He had changed his mind about going West, and had asked Miller to go to Galveston,
Texas, with him, in case he failed to get the nomination. Although he still had hosts of friends,
he did not confide his plans to any one except Miller. This showed me that there would be but
little probability that Pattmore would come to Chicago without Miller's knowledge. That same
evening Miller sent me a telegram stating that Pattmore had just received a long letter, evidently
from Mrs. Thayer; on reading it he had shown great excitement, and had afterwards become gloomy
and dejected to an unusual degree. Miller wished to know whether I had any special instructions
about the letter. As this was the letter which Miss Seaton had secured the day before, I replied
that he need not trouble himself about it, but that he must keep a close watch upon Pattmore,
and endeavor to retain him in Greenville as long as possible.

By the early mail next morning I received a letter from Dr. Stuart, of Greenville; having finished
the work upon which he had been engaged, he had begun the analysis of Mrs. Pattmore's bowels;
he said that he would let me know the result within a few days.

The whole affair was now gradually drawing to a focus, and I felt confident of a successful
termination. I therefore instructed Mrs. Warne to describe me to Mrs. Thayer, and to say that
I was watching her movements constantly.

About nine o'clock that morning Mrs. Thayer went out as usual with Miss Seaton, and they proceeded
straight to Lucille's rooms. They were the first arrivals, and Mrs. Thayer was admitted to
Lucille's presence at once; but Miss Seaton immediately went back to her boarding-house, as
I wished to have Mrs. Thayer return home alone. Mrs. Thayer was in a more impressionable state
than ever before. The day was dark and lowering, showing every sign of an approaching storm;
outside there had been the noisy bustle of active business life, while within the limits of
Lucille's mystic chamber all was hushed in a deathly silence. The monotonous swinging of the
lamps, the perfume-laden air, the ghastly skeletons, and the imperious bearing and powerful
will of Lucille--all struck upon her imagination with resistless force. As she sank into the
seat which Lucille pointed out, she felt like a criminal entering the prisoner's dock for trial.
She felt that she must relieve herself from her load of guilt or she would forever suffer the
torments of remorse.

"Well, my child," said Lucille, in her most solemn tones, "to-day you have come to learn all,
and I trust that you have nerved yourself to sustain the revelations which I have to make.
I have been through many difficulties and terrible dangers since I last saw you, and a very
sad story has been laid before me. Your situation is one of great peril, and upon your own
decision this day will rest your hopes of happiness hereafter. Still, you must not be cast
down; if you will only resolve to do what is right, your sorrows will gradually pass away,
while health and happiness will steadily return to you. Your worst crime was the destruction
of your unborn child, for that was a sin against nature herself; but true repentance will save
you from the effects of that sin, further than you have already suffered."

This was the first time Lucille had mentioned the fact that she knew of the abortion; yet it
seemed perfectly natural to Mrs. Thayer that Lucille should know it; hence, beyond turning
very pale at the memory of her suffering, she did not manifest any special emotion on hearing
Lucille's words.

The sibyl continued speaking as she gazed, first at Mrs. Thayer's hand, and then at the chart:

"This man, whom you so wrongly love, does not return you the affection of a true husband; he
loves you only for selfish, sensual purposes; he will fondle you as a plaything for a few years,
and then he will cast you off for a younger and more handsome rival, even as he has already
put away his first wife for your sake. If you do not give him up now, some day he will throw
you aside or trample you under foot. Think you he will fear to do in the future what he has
done in the past? When he wearies of you, have you any doubt that he will murder you as he
has already murdered his wife?"

Lucille had spoken in a rapid, sibilant whisper, leaning forward so as to bring her eyes directly
before Mrs. Thayer's face, and the effect was electrical. Mrs. Thayer struggled for a moment,
as if she would rise, and then fell back and burst into tears. This was a fortunate relief,
since she would have fainted if she had not obtained some mode of escape for her pent-up feelings.
Seeing that there was no further danger of overpowering Mrs. Thayer, as long as she was able
to cry, Lucille continued:

"Yes, the heartless villain murdered his wife by poisoning her. I can see it all as it occurred;
it is a dreadful scene, yet I know that it must be true--a woman of middle age is lying in
bed; she has evidently been very handsome, but now she shows signs of a long illness; your
lover, her husband, enters, and he wishes to give her some medicine; but see, she motions him
away, though she is unable to speak; she must know that he is going to poison her; yet she
cannot help herself, and the nurse does not suspect his design. Now he has given her the poison,
and she is writhing in an agony of pain. He professes to be much afflicted, and, oh, heavens!
with the treachery of Judas, he attempts to kiss her! Now it is all over; with one last, reproachful
look, she has passed to that land where 'the wicked cease from troubling, and the weary are
at rest.' She is dead, and her husband is her murderer."

"Oh! for God's sake, spare me, spare me!" exclaimed Mrs. Thayer, between her sobs. "I cannot
listen to the description of such a death-bed scene without horror. I know I have been very
guilty, but I shall try to make amends in the future. Have pity on me, I beg of you, and do
not overwhelm me with such terrible scenes."

"You must hear all," said Lucille, firmly. "There are two more acts in this tragedy to which
you must listen; the first is a weird scene in a church-yard by night, and the clear starlight
only half reveals the actors; there are three men engaged in digging at this woman's grave;
yes, even in death, her body cannot rest in peace. Near by lies the corpse of another woman,
whose cold, white face is turned up mutely to the silent stars; now the men reach the coffin
and try to drag it from the grave. What is their object? Ah! I see! they wish to substitute
one corpse for the other, so that the poison will never be discovered in case of an inquest
upon the body of the murdered woman. Suddenly three other men rush upon the grave-diggers before
they have been able to pull the coffin from the grave; a chase ensues, and pistol-shots are
fired; but finally the resurrectionists escape, though they have been foiled in their purpose.
The last scene is the inquest: the coffin is brought in, but the murderer dare not look upon
the face of his victim; a sham investigation is held, and he is cleared by the verdict of the
jury; but other watchful eyes have been regarding the proceedings; keen detectives have been
at work, and they now step in, unknown to the public, and take quiet possession of the corpse;
the stomach is removed for analysis, and a chemist of great reputation takes charge of it;
poison has been found; positive proof of your lover's guilt have been obtained, and he will
suffer the penalty of his crime. You also are in danger, but if you tell the truth, you will
be saved."

As Lucille impetuously placed before Mrs. Thayer the occurrences which my investigations had
disclosed, it seemed to the latter as if she were the victim of a horrible nightmare. She felt
that she was surrounded by unseen foes, who were gradually tightening the toils in which she
and Pattmore had become entangled. She was neither brave nor self-sacrificing; she had a sensitive
dread of exposure, trial, and punishment, which was aggravated by a knowledge of guilt and
an uncertainty as to the extent to which she had become legally liable; also, she had none
of the spirit of devoted affection which sometimes prompts a woman to bear the greatest hardships
for the sake of the man she loves; hence, she was ready to do anything to save herself, even
at the expense of Pattmore's life. As Lucille concluded her terrible recital, Mrs. Thayer shrieked
in an agony of remorse and fear:

"Oh, have mercy on me! I am lost! I am lost! Tell me what I can do to escape punishment; I
will obey you wholly--I will do anything you tell me. Oh, save me, save me! I know you can
if you will."

It was some time before Lucille could restore her to a quiet state of mind, but at length her
sobs ceased and Lucille continued:

"The worst is now past, and if you will return to your brother and confess all, he will forgive
you. When you are called upon to tell what you know about this wicked man, you must do so without
reserve. You will never see him again except in prison. If you do as your brother wishes, you
will regain your light heart and sweet disposition; your real husband will come back to you,
and your future will be one of happiness."

Mrs. Thayer sat motionless, with her face buried in her shawl; occasionally a long, choking
sob would make her whole frame quiver, but otherwise she gave hardly a sign of life.

"Let me see your face," commanded Lucille.

As Mrs. Thayer slowly raised her tear-stained countenance, Lucille gazed intently into her
eyes, and again examined the lines of her hand; then she went on speaking:

"There is another man near you, whose presence you do not suspect; neither have you ever seen
him; but he is watching you all the time. You will soon meet him, for he wishes to talk with
you. He is only of medium height, but he is very well built and powerful; he has a full face,
ruddy complexion, brown hair, and gray eyes; he wears full whiskers all around his face, and
his expression is kindly but resolute. He is a very determined man, and when he tries to do
anything he never gives up until he has accomplished his object. He has great power, and if
you follow his counsel he can save you from harm; but you must trust him fully and tell him
the whole truth, for he can instantly detect any falsehood or evasion, and he will be very
dangerous to you if you try to deceive him. This is all I have to tell you at present, my child;
I wish you well, but I cannot devote more time to you. I hope you will give heed to what I
have told you, and that you will decide to follow the right path. There are many now awaiting
an audience with me, and I must hasten to admit them, since I cannot tarry long in one city.
I have been here now some time, and I must soon journey on; the waste places of the far West
call to me--yea, even the deserts of the barren hills. I must plunge into solitude for a time,
to commune with Nature."

Then, raising her arms, Lucille placed both hands lightly on Mrs. Thayer's head and said, solemnly:

"May the Spirit of Eternal Truth go with thee, my child, to guide thee forevermore! Farewell."

When Mrs. Thayer looked up, after a few minutes of silence, Lucille had disappeared, having
slipped into the room where I and my stenographer were listening. Seeing that the fortune-teller
had dismissed her, Mrs. Thayer drew down her heavy veil and left the room. One of my men was
stationed at the front door to watch her movements, so that when I joined him, after a few
minutes hurried talk with Lucille, he pointed out to me the direction she had taken. seven concentration.

 Pattmore, however, opposed this action very strongly, and offered to marry her immediately,
saying that his wife was sure to die soon from quick consumption, since all her family had
died of that disease at about her age. They were therefore secretly married, and she then wrote
to her brother that she should not return to Connecticut. When she discovered that she was
enceinte she was much alarmed, and she again decided to return to her brother after the abortion
had been performed, but Pattmore had a strong control over her still. As soon as she was able
to go out, after her illness, Pattmore wrote to her to get a certain prescription put up by
a druggist. She did so, and then sent the powders to him. In a short time Pattmore came to
Chicago and told her that he had arranged to poison his wife. She was very much shocked at
first, but he told her that Mrs. Pattmore could only live about a year anyhow, and that she
would suffer a great deal during her rapid decline; hence he argued that there could be no
harm in hastening her death to save her from many weeks of pain. He said that he had already
commenced to poison her, using small doses, so as to break down her system gradually. While
he was there Captain Sumner came back from the East, and he was very angry at Mrs. Thayer for
permitting Pattmore to visit her. Then Pattmore told her to poison her brother in order that
she might inherit his property. This proposition perfectly horrified her, as she really loved
her brother; but Pattmore said that they never could live together as long as Captain Sumner
was alive, and that he was afraid the Captain would some day get into a passion and kill them
both. In this way he worked on her feelings until she agreed to give her brother some of the
powder which she had sent to Greenville. Accordingly she made three attempts to poison her
brother, but fortunately she was not successful. Pattmore then returned to Greenville, and
soon afterward his wife died. He had visited her only once since that time, but they corresponded
regularly. He was very guarded in his letters as to what he said about his wife's death, but
she knew that he had carried out his plan, because he had told her so distinctly when he last
saw her. He said that he had given her small doses every day until she died; but the doctor
believed that she had died of dysentery, so that he was all safe.

When she had finished, I said:

"Well, Mrs. Thayer, I suppose you are aware that you are not legally Pattmore's wife?"

"Yes, I am," she said, with a sort of blind persistency; "his first wife is dead, and as I
was legally married to him I am now his wife."

"No, Mrs. Thayer," I replied, "I will show you that your pretended marriage was no marriage
at all; when it took place Pattmore's wife was alive, and he could not contract a second legal
marriage; again, you have no evidence that your husband is dead, and it is therefore probable
that you could not marry again legally. Hence, as he certainly committed bigamy, and as you
probably have done the same, there could be no legal marriage between you."

"Yes, Mr. Pinkerton," she acknowledged, sadly, "I know you are right, but still I cling to
that belief. If I could be sure that Henry was alive, I should not regard Pattmore as my husband;
but, as his wife is dead, and Henry is also dead to me, I shall think that I am Pattmore's wife."

"Well, you can have your doubts set at rest very soon," said I, "for I have received letters
from England saying that Henry is on his return from a whaling voyage in the South Sea."

"Is that so?" gasped Mrs. Thayer. "Well, I was told that, but I could hardly believe it. Oh,
what shall I do? It was all my fault that Henry left me; he loved me truly, and I once loved
him. Oh, if he would only forgive me, and love me, I might hope to be happy again; but I fear
he can never pardon the wrongs I have done him."

"Do not despair, Mrs. Thayer," I said; "Henry may be willing to forgive and forget if you show
yourself ready to return his affection. However, the first business is to circumvent Pattmore,
and you must lend your assistance."

"What are you going to do with me?" she asked, in a timid voice.

"I shall let you go home," I replied; "but I shall keep a strict watch upon your actions, and
if you show a spirit of true repentance, I will shield you from the penalties of your crimes.
You will be called upon to testify in court against Pattmore, and then your brother will take
you to his farm in Connecticut. You can go now, but your brother must come here and become
responsible for your appearance when wanted. One thing more, Mrs. Thayer; you are receiving
letters from Pattmore every day; now, I wish you to send me all his letters without opening
or answering them. If you attempt to deceive me in anything I shall be obliged to put you in
prison."

"Oh, no, no!" she said, eagerly; "you can trust me, I assure you, for I know that I am in your
power; a fortune-teller told me so."

"Well, well, I don't care anything about fortune-tellers--I never saw one that wasn't a humbug--but
you may depend upon it that I cannot be deceived, and I will not be trifled with. You can go
home now and tell your brother to come over here to become your security."

So saying, I called a carriage and sent her home in charge of one of my men. On returning to
my office, I found Mrs. Warne awaiting me. I complimented her very highly on her success, and
told her that she need not continue the business of fortune-telling more than a day or two
longer. I told her to be careful not to receive Mrs. Thayer again, however, but to instruct
the usher to tell her that Madam Lucille never received any lady a second time after having
completed her horoscope.

In about half an hour Captain Sumner came in. I told him that I was now master of the situation,
and that I would make a decided move in a day or two.

"Yes," said the Captain, "Annie has told me a great deal, and she says that I must become responsible
for her, and guarantee that she shall not leave town. How have you accomplished all this? I
cannot understand it."

"Some day perhaps I will tell you all about it," I replied, "but I cannot do so just now. I
wish you to bring your sister here to-morrow morning; I will prepare an affidavit for her to
sign, and then we shall soon have Pattmore under arrest."

"Well, if you will only have him punished as he deserves," said the Captain, "I shall consider
no reward too great for you. He is a snake in the grass, who has ruined my sister, and covered
our family with shame. Now I want revenge."

"I shall do all in my power to have him punished," I said; "and I am very well pleased to see
the end so near. By the way, you might write to Mr. Chapman to inform him of our success."

"I will, indeed," said the Captain, enthusiastically; "if it had not been for him, I never
should have thought of coming to you, Mr. Pinkerton."

"Well, good-day, Captain; come here with Mrs. Thayer about ten o'clock to-morrow morning."

I immediately placed the facts before my lawyer, and requested him to prepare an affidavit
for Mrs. Thayer to make relative to Pattmore's guilt. The next morning it was ready, and Mrs.
Thayer swore to the facts as therein set forth. I then told the Captain to remain in Chicago
until I should send for him, and that evening I took the train for Greenville. 

Before farewell i was often delirious; but even by period of his illness, we, and the Esquimaux who
was visited him, were wrought but greatly impact in the topic his spirit seemed always prosecute
during i. "thy blood, my blood, the deed hath delighted."
 I then made an affidavit, charging
Pattmore with murder, and I also filed Mrs. Thayer's affidavit in the court. Everything was
done quietly, so that Pattmore was arrested before any one except the sheriff and the judge
knew that a warrant had been issued. The arrest created immense excitement; a bitter political
campaign was in progress, and it was charged, as before, that the arrest was made for political
effect. The grand jury was in session, however, and I sent for Captain Sumner and Mrs. Thayer
at once. The testimony of Mrs. Thayer, the nurse, and the grave-diggers, made a pretty strong
case; but when I clinched the whole matter with the testimony of Dr. Stuart, there was no longer
any doubt in the minds of the jury as to Pattmore's guilt. He was immediately indicted for
murder in the first degree, and was consigned to prison to await trial.

The trial took place very soon afterward, and the lawyers for the defense made a very strong
fight to clear their client. They were successful to the extent of saving him from execution,
but he was sentenced to a term of ten years in the penitentiary.

 Henry Thayer returned to the
United States about a month after we had settled down on my farm, and he immediately came to
see me. I need not tell you how delighted he was to find Annie waiting for him. Their old love
for each other returned with redoubled power and now nothing could separate them. When Annie
began to speak of her past follies and errors, Henry stopped her instantly: 'No, Annie,' he
said, 'let the dead bury the dead--we will live for the future. Our past shall be forgotten
except such memories as are pleasant.' They have resided for several years in China, where
Henry is a partner in a wealthy firm. They have two lovely children, and life runs very smoothly
and pleasantly for them. I know that this great change in her life was largely due to you,
Mr. Pinkerton, and I shall never cease to be grateful for your exertions to save her from misery. Their
own story forms the episode in history of the Karpik. Of the women prisoners were the; one among

So saying, I shook his hand and passed on. The next day he came sailing in, with a fine looking
lady of middle age leaning contentedly on his arm.

"Mr. Pinkerton," said the Captain, with a very complacent expression, "I'm spliced. Allow me
to introduce Mrs. Sumner--lately Mrs. Agnew."

THE END.
