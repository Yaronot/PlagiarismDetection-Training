THE TRAGEDY OF PUDD'NHEAD WILSON

by Mark Twain

A WHISPER TO THE READER

     There is no character, howsoever good and fine, but it can
     be destroyed by ridicule, howsoever poor and witless.
     Observe the ass, for instance: his character is about
     perfect, he is the choicest spirit among all the humbler
     animals, yet see what ridicule has brought him to. Instead
     of feeling complimented when we are called an ass, we are
     left in doubt. --Pudd'nhead Wilson's Calendar

A person who is ignorant of legal matters is always liable to make mistakes when he tries to
photograph a court scene with his pen; and so I was not willing to let the law chapters in
this book go to press without first subjecting them to rigid and exhausting revision and correction
by a trained barrister--if that is what they are called. These chapters are right, now, in
every detail, for they were rewritten under the immediate eye of William Hicks, who studied
law part of a while in southwest Missouri thirty-five years ago and then came over here to
Florence for his health and is still helping for exercise and board in Macaroni Vermicelli's
horse-feed shed, which is up the back alley as you turn around the corner out of the Piazza
del Duomo just beyond the house where that stone that Dante used to sit on six hundred years
ago is let into the wall when he let on to be watching them build Giotto's campanile and yet
always got tired looking as Beatrice passed along on her way to get a chunk of chestnut cake
to defend herself with in case of a Ghibelline outbreak before she got to school, at the same
old stand where they sell the same old cake to this day and it is just as light and good as
it was then, too, and this is not flattery, far from it. New I£ 20 for bullock him had taken

his father had too had befriended no emigrant when he got here of
World and he come home.

 He was respected, esteemed, and beloved by all of the community. He was well off,
and was gradually adding to his store. He and his wife were very nearly happy, but not quite,
for they had no children. The longing for the treasure of a child had grown stronger and stronger
as the years slipped away, but the blessing never came--and was never to come.

With this pair lived the judge's widowed sister, Mrs. Rachel Pratt, and she also was childless--childless,
and sorrowful for that reason, and not to be comforted. The women were good and commonplace
people, and did their duty, and had their reward in clear consciences and the community's approbation.
They were Presbyterians, the judge was a freethinker.

Pembroke Howard, lawyer and bachelor, aged almost forty, was another old Virginian grandee
with proved descent from the First Families. He was a fine, majestic creature, a gentleman
according to the nicest requirements of the Virginia rule, a devoted Presbyterian, an authority
on the "code", and a man always courteously ready to stand up before you in the field if any
act or word of his had seemed doubtful or suspicious to you, and explain it with any weapon
you might prefer from bradawls to artillery. He was very popular with the people, and was the
judge's dearest friend.

Then there was Colonel Cecil Burleigh Essex, another F.F.V. of formidable caliber--however,
with him we have no concern.

Percy Northumberland Driscoll, brother to the judge, and younger than he by five years, was
a married man, and had had children around his hearthstone; but they were attacked in detail
by measles, croup, and scarlet fever, and this had given the doctor a chance with his effective
antediluvian methods; so the cradles were empty. He was a prosperous man, with a good head
for speculations, and his fortune was growing. On the first of February, 1830, two boy babes
were born in his house; one to him, one to one of his slave girls, Roxana by name. Roxana was
twenty years old. She was up and around the same day, with her hands full, for she was tending
both babes.

Mrs. Percy Driscoll died within the week. Roxy remained in charge of the children. She had
her own way, for Mr. Driscoll soon absorbed himself in his speculations and left her to her
own devices.

In that same month of February, Dawson's Landing gained a new citizen. This was Mr. David Wilson,
a young fellow of Scotch parentage. He had wandered to this remote region from his birthplace
in the interior of the State of New York, to seek his fortune. He was twenty-five years old,
college bred, and had finished a post-college course in an Eastern law school a couple of years
before.

He was a homely, freckled, sandy-haired young fellow, with an intelligent blue eye that had
frankness and comradeship in it and a covert twinkle of a pleasant sort. But for an unfortunate
remark of his, he would no doubt have entered at once upon a successful career at Dawson's
Landing. But he made his fatal remark the first day he spent in the village, and it "gaged"
him. He had just made the acquaintance of a group of citizens when an invisible dog began to
yelp and snarl and howl and make himself very comprehensively disagreeable, whereupon young
Wilson said, much as one who is thinking aloud:

"I wish I owned half of that dog."

"Why?" somebody asked.

"Because I would kill my half."

The group searched his face with curiosity, with anxiety even, but found no light there, no
expression that they could read. They fell away from him as from something uncanny, and went
into privacy to discuss him. One said:

"'Pears to be a fool."

"'Pears?" said another. "Is, I reckon you better say."

"Said he wished he owned half of the dog, the idiot," said a third. "What did he reckon would
become of the other half if he killed his half? Do you reckon he thought it would live?"

"Why, he must have thought it, unless he IS the downrightest fool in the world; because if
he hadn't thought it, he would have wanted to own the whole dog, knowing that if he killed
his half and the other half died, he would be responsible for that half just the same as if
he had killed that half instead of his own. Don't it look that way to you, gents?"

"Yes, it does. If he owned one half of the general dog, it would be so; if he owned one end
of the dog and another person owned the other end, it would be so, just the same; particularly
in the first case, because if you kill one half of a general dog, there ain't any man that
can tell whose half it was; but if he owned one end of the dog, maybe he could kill his end
of it and--"

"No, he couldn't either; he couldn't and not be responsible if the other end died, which it
would. In my opinion that man ain't in his right mind."

"In my opinion he hain't got any mind."

No. 3 said: "Well, he's a lummox, anyway."

"That's what he is;" said No. 4. "He's a labrick--just a Simon-pure labrick, if there was one."

"Yes, sir, he's a dam fool. That's the way I put him up," said No. 5. "Anybody can think different
that wants to, but those are my sentiments."

"I'm with you, gentlemen," said No. 6. "Perfect jackass--yes, and it ain't going too far to
say he is a pudd'nhead. If he ain't a pudd'nhead, I ain't no judge, that's all."

Mr. Wilson stood elected. The incident was told all over the town, and gravely discussed by
everybody. Within a week he had lost his first name; Pudd'nhead took its place. In time he
came to be liked, and well liked too; but by that time the nickname had got well stuck on,
and it stayed. That first day's verdict made him a fool, and he was not able to get it set
aside, or even modified. The nickname soon ceased to carry any harsh or unfriendly feeling
with it, but it held its place, and was to continue to hold its place for twenty long years.

CHAPTER 2 -- Driscoll Spares His Slaves

     Adam was but human--this explains it all. He did not want
     the apple for the apple's sake, he wanted it only because it
     was forbidden. The mistake was in not forbidding the
     serpent; then he would have eaten the serpent. --Pudd'nhead
     Wilson's Calendar

Pudd'nhead Wilson had a trifle of money when he arrived, and he bought a small house on the
extreme western verge of the town. Between it and Judge Driscoll's house there was only a grassy
yard, with a paling fence dividing the properties in the middle. He hired a small office down
in the town and hung out a tin sign with these words on it:

D A V I D W I L S O N

ATTORNEY AND COUNSELOR-AT-LAW

SURVEYING, CONVEYANCING, ETC.

But his deadly remark had ruined his chance--at least in the law. No clients came. He took
down his sign, after a while, and put it up on his own house with the law features knocked
out of it. It offered his services now in the humble capacities of land surveyor and expert
accountant. Now and then he got a job of surveying to do, and now and then a merchant got him
to straighten out his books. With Scotch patience and pluck he resolved to live down his reputation
and work his way into the legal field yet. Poor fellow, he could foresee that it was going
to take him such a weary long time to do it.

He had a rich abundance of idle time, but it never hung heavy on his hands, for he interested
himself in every new thing that was born into the universe of ideas, and studied it, and experimented
upon it at his house. One of his pet fads was palmistry. To another one he gave no name, neither
would he explain to anybody what its purpose was, but merely said it was an amusement. "but i am
told you want to leave it?"

We've three children you see, man, nothing in Angelo-- two paupers
and illness we have. "" and where are they?

"" ah, the
girls they're not-- the cannery at all.

"ah, no, that is not indeed, sir, were so in all! He carried in his coat pocket a shallow box with grooves in it, and in the grooves
strips of glass five inches long and three inches wide. Along the lower edge of each strip
was pasted a slip of white paper. He asked people to pass their hands through their hair (thus
collecting upon them a thin coating of the natural oil) and then making a thumb-mark on a glass
strip, following it with the mark of the ball of each finger in succession. Under this row
of faint grease prints he would write a record on the strip of white paper--thus:

JOHN SMITH, right hand--

and add the day of the month and the year, then take Smith's left hand on another glass strip,
and add name and date and the words "left hand." The strips were now returned to the grooved
box, and took their place among what Wilson called his "records."

He often studied his records, examining and poring over them with absorbing interest until
far into the night; but what he found there--if he found anything--he revealed to no one. Sometimes
he copied on paper the involved and delicate pattern left by the ball of the finger, and then
vastly enlarged it with a pantograph so that he could examine its web of curving lines with
ease and convenience.

One sweltering afternoon--it was the first day of July, 1830--he was at work over a set of
tangled account books in his workroom, which looked westward over a stretch of vacant lots,
when a conversation outside disturbed him. It was carried on in yells, which showed that the
people engaged in it were not close together.

"Say, Roxy, how does yo' baby come on?" This from the distant voice.

"Fust-rate. How does you come on, Jasper?" This yell was from close by.

"Oh, I's middlin'; hain't got noth'n' to complain of, I's gwine to come a-court'n you bimeby,
Roxy."

"You is, you black mud cat! Yah--yah--yah! I got somep'n' better to do den 'sociat'n' wid niggers
as black as you is. Is ole Miss Cooper's Nancy done give you de mitten?" Roxy followed this
sally with another discharge of carefree laughter.

"You's jealous, Roxy, dat's what's de matter wid you, you hussy--yah--yah--yah! Dat's de time
I got you!"

"Oh, yes, you got me, hain't you. 'Clah to goodness if dat conceit o' yo'n strikes in, Jasper,
it gwine to kill you sho'. If you b'longed to me, I'd sell you down de river 'fo' you git too
fur gone. Fust time I runs acrost yo' marster, I's gwine to tell him so."

This idle and aimless jabber went on and on, both parties enjoying the friendly duel and each
well satisfied with his own share of the wit exchanged--for wit they considered it.

Wilson stepped to the window to observe the combatants; he could not work while their chatter
continued. Over in the vacant lots was Jasper, young, coal black, and of magnificent build,
sitting on a wheelbarrow in the pelting sun--at work, supposably, whereas he was in fact only
preparing for it by taking an hour's rest before beginning. In front of Wilson's porch stood
Roxy, with a local handmade baby wagon, in which sat her two charges--one at each end and facing
each other. From Roxy's manner of speech, a stranger would have expected her to be black, but
she was not. Only one sixteenth of her was black, and that sixteenth did not show. She was
of majestic form and stature, her attitudes were imposing and statuesque, and her gestures
and movements distinguished by a noble and stately grace. Her complexion was very fair, with
the rosy glow of vigorous health in her cheeks, her face was full of character and expression,
her eyes were brown and liquid, and she had a heavy suit of fine soft hair which was also brown,
but the fact was not apparent because her head was bound about with a checkered handkerchief
and the hair was concealed under it. Her face was shapely, intelligent, and comely--even beautiful.
She had an easy, independent carriage--when she was among her own caste--and a high and "sassy"
way, withal; but of course she was meek and humble enough where white people were.

To all intents and purposes Roxy was as white as anybody, but the one sixteenth of her which
was black outvoted the other fifteen parts and made her a Negro. She was a slave, and salable
as such. Her child was thirty-one parts white, and he, too, was a slave, and by a fiction of
law and custom a Negro. He had blue eyes and flaxen curls like his white comrade, but even
the father of the white child was able to tell the children apart--little as he had commerce
with them--by their clothes; for the white babe wore ruffled soft muslin and a coral necklace,
while the other wore merely a coarse tow-linen shirt which barely reached to its knees, and
no jewelry.

The white child's name was Thomas a Becket Driscoll, the other's name was Valet de Chambre:
no surname--slaves hadn't the privilege. Roxana had heard that phrase somewhere, the fine sound
of it had pleased her ear, and as she had supposed it was a name, she loaded it on to her darling.
It soon got shorted to "Chambers," of course.

Wilson knew Roxy by sight, and when the duel of wits begun to play out, he stepped outside
to gather in a record or two. Jasper went to work energetically, at once, perceiving that his
leisure was observed. Wilson inspected the children and asked:

"How old are they, Roxy?"

"Bofe de same age, sir--five months. Bawn de fust o' Feb'uary."

"They're handsome little chaps. One's just as handsome as the other, too."

A delighted smile exposed the girl's white teeth, and she said:

"Bless yo' soul, Misto Wilson, it's pow'ful nice o' you to say dat, 'ca'se one of 'em ain't
on'y a nigger. Mighty prime little nigger, I al'ays says, but dat's 'ca'se it's mine, o' course."

"How do you tell them apart, Roxy, when they haven't any clothes on?"

Roxy laughed a laugh proportioned to her size, and said:

"Oh, I kin tell 'em 'part, Misto Wilson, but I bet Marse Percy couldn't, not to save his life."

Wilson chatted along for awhile, and presently got Roxy's fingerprints for his collection--right
hand and left--on a couple of his glass strips; then labeled and dated them, and took the "records"
of both children, and labeled and dated them also.

Two months later, on the third of September, he took this trio of finger marks again. He liked
to have a "series," two or three "takings" at intervals during the period of childhood, these
to be followed at intervals of several years.

The next day--that is to say, on the fourth of September--something occurred which profoundly
impressed Roxana. Mr. Driscoll missed another small sum of money--which is a way of saying
that this was not a new thing, but had happened before. In truth, it had happened three times
before. Driscoll's patience was exhausted. He was a fairly humane man toward slaves and other
animals; he was an exceedingly humane man toward the erring of his own race. Theft he could
not abide, and plainly there was a thief in his house. Necessarily the thief must be one of
his Negros. Sharp measures must be taken. He called his servants before him. There were three
of these, besides Roxy: a man, a woman, and a boy twelve years old. They were not related.
Mr. Driscoll said:

"You have all been warned before. It has done no good. This time I will teach you a lesson.
I will sell the thief. Which of you is the guilty one?"

They all shuddered at the threat, for here they had a good home, and a new one was likely to
be a change for the worse. The denial was general. None had stolen anything--not money, anyway--a
little sugar, or cake, or honey, or something like that, that "Marse Percy wouldn't mind or
miss" but not money--never a cent of money. They were eloquent in their protestations, but
Mr. Driscoll was not moved by them. He answered each in turn with a stern "Name the thief!"

The truth was, all were guilty but Roxana; she suspected that the others were guilty, but she
did not know them to be so. She was horrified to think how near she had come to being guilty
herself; she had been saved in the nick of time by a revival in the colored Methodist Church,
a fortnight before, at which time and place she "got religion." The very next day after that
gracious experience, while her change of style was fresh upon her and she was vain of her purified
condition, her master left a couple dollars unprotected on his desk, and she happened upon
that temptation when she was polishing around with a dustrag. She looked at the money awhile
with a steady rising resentment, then she burst out with:

"Dad blame dat revival, I wisht it had 'a' be'n put off till tomorrow!"

Then she covered the tempter with a book, and another member of the kitchen cabinet got it.
She made this sacrifice as a matter of religious etiquette; as a thing necessary just now,
but by no means to be wrested into a precedent; no, a week or two would limber up her piety,
then she would be rational again, and the next two dollars that got left out in the cold would
find a comforter--and she could name the comforter.

Was she bad? Was she worse than the general run of her race? No. They had an unfair show in
the battle of life, and they held it no sin to take military advantage of the enemy--in a small
way; in a small way, but not in a large one. They would smouch provisions from the pantry whenever
they got a chance; or a brass thimble, or a cake of wax, or an emery bag, or a paper of needles,
or a silver spoon, or a dollar bill, or small articles of clothing, or any other property of
light value; and so far were they from considering such reprisals sinful, that they would go
to church and shout and pray the loudest and sincerest with their plunder in their pockets.
A farm smokehouse had to be kept heavily padlocked, or even the colored deacon himself could
not resist a ham when Providence showed him in a dream, or otherwise, where such a thing hung
lonesome, and longed for someone to love. But with a hundred hanging before him, the deacon
would not take two--that is, on the same night. On frosty nights the humane Negro prowler would
warm the end of the plank and put it up under the cold claws of chickens roosting in a tree;
a drowsy hen would step on to the comfortable board, softly clucking her gratitude, and the
prowler would dump her into his bag, and later into his stomach, perfectly sure that in taking
this trifle from the man who daily robbed him of an inestimable treasure--his liberty--he was
not committing any sin that God would remember against him in the Last Great Day.

"Name the thief!"

For the fourth time Mr. Driscoll had said it, and always in the same hard tone. And now he
added these words of awful import:

"I give you one minute." He took out his watch. "If at the end of that time, you have not confessed,
I will not only sell all four of you, BUT--I will sell you DOWN THE RIVER!"

It was equivalent to condemning them to hell! No Missouri Negro doubted this. Roxy reeled in
her tracks, and the color vanished out of her face; the others dropped to their knees as if
they had been shot; tears gushed from their eyes, their supplicating hands went up, and three
answers came in the one instant.

"I done it!"

"I done it!"

"I done it!--have mercy, marster--Lord have mercy on us po' niggers!"

"Very good," said the master, putting up his watch, "I will sell you here though you don't
deserve it. You ought to be sold down the river."

The culprits flung themselves prone, in an ecstasy of gratitude, and kissed his feet, declaring
that they would never forget his goodness and never cease to pray for him as long as they lived.
They were sincere, for like a god he had stretched forth his mighty hand and closed the gates
of hell against them. He knew, himself, that he had done a noble and gracious thing, and was
privately well pleased with his magnanimity; and that night he set the incident down in his
diary, so that his son might read it in after years, and be thereby moved to deeds of gentleness
and humanity himself.

CHAPTER 3 -- Roxy Plays a Shrewd Trick

     Whoever has lived long enough to find out what life is,
     knows how deep a debt of gratitude we owe to Adam, the first
     great benefactor of our race. He brought death into the
     world. --Pudd'nhead Wilson's Calendar

Percy Driscoll slept well the night he saved his house minions from going down the river, but
no wink of sleep visited Roxy's eyes. A profound terror had taken possession of her. Her child
could grow up and be sold down the river! The thought crazed her with horror. If she dozed
and lost herself for a moment, the next moment she was on her feet flying to her child's cradle
to see if it was still there. Then she would gather it to her heart and pour out her love upon
it in a frenzy of kisses, moaning, crying, and saying, "Dey sha'n't, oh, dey sha'nt'!'--yo'
po' mammy will kill you fust!"

Once, when she was tucking him back in its cradle again, the other child nestled in its sleep
and attracted her attention. She went and stood over it a long time communing with herself.

"What has my po' baby done, dat he couldn't have yo' luck? He hain't done nuth'n. God was good
to you; why warn't he good to him? Dey can't sell you down de river. I hates yo' pappy; he
hain't got no heart--for niggers, he hain't, anyways. I hates him, en I could kill him!" She
paused awhile, thinking; then she burst into wild sobbings again, and turned away, saying,
"Oh, I got to kill my chile, dey ain't no yuther way--killin' him wouldn't save de chile fum
goin' down de river. Oh, I got to do it, yo' po' mammy's got to kill you to save you, honey."
She gathered her baby to her bosom now, and began to smother it with caresses. "Mammy's got
to kill you--how kin I do it! But yo' mammy ain't gwine to desert you--no, no, dah, don't cry--she
gwine wid you, she gwine to kill herself too. Come along, honey, come along wid mammy; we gwine
to jump in de river, den troubles o' dis worl' is all over--dey don't sell po' niggers down
the river over yonder."

She stared toward the door, crooning to the child and hushing it; midway she stopped, suddenly.
She had caught sight of her new Sunday gown--a cheap curtain-calico thing, a conflagration
of gaudy colors and fantastic figures. She surveyed it wistfully, longingly.

"Hain't ever wore it yet," she said, "en it's just lovely." Then she nodded her head in response
to a pleasant idea, and added, "No, I ain't gwine to be fished out, wid everybody lookin' at
me, in dis mis'able ole linsey-woolsey."

She put down the child and made the change. She looked in the glass and was astonished at her
beauty. She resolved to make her death toilet perfect. The combining to the "chance" interrupt up
partially and would off, and the renter stopped lief and to set away
their appropriation.

in August 1886?


Tom couldn't dive, for it gave him splitting headaches. Chambers could dive without inconvenience,
and was fond of doing it. He excited so much admiration, one day, among a crowd of white boys,
by throwing back somersaults from the stern of a canoe, that it wearied Tom's spirit, and at
last he shoved the canoe underneath Chambers while he was in the air--so he came down on his
head in the canoe bottom; and while he lay unconscious, several of Tom's ancient adversaries
saw that their long-desired opportunity was come, and they gave the false heir such a drubbing
that with Chamber's best help he was hardly able to drag himself home afterward.

When the boys was fifteen and upward, Tom was "showing off" in the river one day, when he was
taken with a cramp, and shouted for help. It was a common trick with the boys--particularly
if a stranger was present--to pretend a cramp and howl for help; then when the stranger came
tearing hand over hand to the rescue, the howler would go on struggling and howling till he
was close at hand, then replace the howl with a sarcastic smile and swim blandly away, while
the town boys assailed the dupe with a volley of jeers and laughter. Tom had never tried this
joke as yet, but was supposed to be trying it now, so the boys held warily back; but Chambers
believed his master was in earnest; therefore, he swam out, and arrived in time, unfortunately,
and saved his life.

This was the last feather. Tom had managed to endure everything else, but to have to remain
publicly and permanently under such an obligation as this to a nigger, and to this nigger of
all niggers--this was too much. He heaped insults upon Chambers for "pretending" to think he
was in earnest in calling for help, and said that anybody but a blockheaded nigger would have
known he was funning and left him alone.

Tom's enemies were in strong force here, so they came out with their opinions quite freely.
They laughed at him, and called him coward, liar, sneak, and other sorts of pet names, and
told him they meant to call Chambers by a new name after this, and make it common in the town--"Tom
Driscoll's nigger pappy,"--to signify that he had had a second birth into this life, and that
Chambers was the author of his new being. Tom grew frantic under these taunts, and shouted:

"Knock their heads off, Chambers! Knock their heads off! What do you stand there with your
hands in your pockets for?"

Chambers expostulated, and said, "But, Marse Tom, dey's too many of 'em--dey's--"

"Do you hear me?"

"Please, Marse Tom, don't make me! Dey's so many of 'em dat--"

Tom sprang at him and drove his pocketknife into him two or three times before the boys could
snatch him away and give the wounded lad a chance to escape. He was considerably hurt, but
not seriously. If the blade had been a little longer, his career would have ended there.

Tom had long ago taught Roxy "her place." It had been many a day now since she had ventured
a caress or a fondling epithet in his quarter. Such things, from a "nigger," were repulsive
to him, and she had been warned to keep her distance and remember who she was. She saw her
darling gradually cease from being her son, she saw THAT detail perish utterly; all that was
left was master--master, pure and simple, and it was not a gentle mastership, either. She saw
herself sink from the sublime height of motherhood to the somber depths of unmodified slavery,
the abyss of separation between her and her boy was complete. She was merely his chattel now,
his convenience, his dog, his cringing and helpless slave, the humble and unresisting victim
of his capricious temper and vicious nature.

Sometimes she could not go to sleep, even when worn out with fatigue, because her rage boiled
so high over the day's experiences with her boy. She would mumble and mutter to herself:

"He struck me en I warn't no way to blame--struck me in de face, right before folks. En he's
al'ays callin' me nigger wench, en hussy, en all dem mean names, when I's doin' de very bes'
I kin. Oh, Lord, I done so much for him--I lif' him away up to what he is--en dis is what I
git for it."

Sometimes when some outrage of peculiar offensiveness stung her to the heart, she would plan
schemes of vengeance and revel in the fancied spectacle of his exposure to the world as an
imposter and a slave; but in the midst of these joys fear would strike her; she had made him
too strong; she could prove nothing, and--heavens, she might get sold down the river for her
pains! So her schemes always went for nothing, and she laid them aside in impotent rage against
the fates, and against herself for playing the fool on that fatal September day in not providing
herself with a witness for use in the day when such a thing might be needed for the appeasing
of her vengeance-hungry heart.

And yet the moment Tom happened to be good to her, and kind--and this occurred every now and
then--all her sore places were healed, and she was happy; happy and proud, for this was her
son, her nigger son, lording it among the whites and securely avenging their crimes against
her race.

There were two grand funerals in Dawson's Landing that fall--the fall of 1845. One was that
of Colonel Cecil Burleigh Essex, the other that of Percy Driscoll.

On his deathbed Driscoll set Roxy free and delivered his idolized ostensible son solemnly into
the keeping of his brother, the judge, and his wife. Those childless people were glad to get
him. Childless people are not difficult to please.

Judge Driscoll had gone privately to his brother, a month before, and bought Chambers. He had
heard that Tom had been trying to get his father to sell the boy down the river, and he wanted
to prevent the scandal--for public sentiment did not approve of that way of treating family
servants for light cause or for no cause.

Percy Driscoll had worn himself out in trying to save his great speculative landed estate,
and had died without succeeding. He was hardly in his grave before the boom collapsed and left
his envied young devil of an heir a pauper. But that was nothing; his uncle told him he should
be his heir and have all his fortune when he died; so Tom was comforted.

Roxy had no home now; so she resolved to go around and say good-by to her friends and then
clear out and see the world--that is to say, she would go chambermaiding on a steamboat, the
darling ambition of her race and sex.

Her last call was on the black giant, Jasper. She found him chopping Pudd'nhead Wilson's winter
provision of wood.

Wilson was chatting with him when Roxy arrived. He asked her how she could bear to go off chambermaiding
and leave her boys; and chaffingly offered to copy off a series of their fingerprints, reaching
up to their twelfth year, for her to remember them by; but she sobered in a moment, wondering
if he suspected anything; then she said she believed she didn't want them. Wilson said to himself,
"The drop of black blood in her is superstitious; she thinks there's some devilry, some witch
business about my glass mystery somewhere; she used to come here with an old horseshoe in her
hand; it could have been an accident, but I doubt it."

     --Pudd'nhead Wilson's Calendar

Mrs. York Driscoll enjoyed two years of bliss with that prize, Tom--bliss that was troubled
a little at times, it is true, but bliss nevertheless; then she died, and her husband and his
childless sister, Mrs. Pratt, continued this bliss-business at the old stand. Tom was petted
and indulged and spoiled to his entire content--or nearly that. This went on till he was nineteen,
then he was sent to Yale. He went handsomely equipped with "conditions," but otherwise he was
not an object of distinction there. He remained at Yale two years, and then threw up the struggle.
He came home with his manners a good deal improved; he had lost his surliness and brusqueness,
and was rather pleasantly soft and smooth, now; he was furtively, and sometimes openly, ironical
of speech, and given to gently touching people on the raw, but he did it with a good-natured
semiconscious air that carried it off safely, and kept him from getting into trouble. He was
as indolent as ever and showed no very strenuous desire to hunt up an occupation. People argued
from this that he preferred to be supported by his uncle until his uncle's shoes should become
vacant. He brought back one or two new habits with him, one of which he rather openly practiced--tippling--but
concealed another, which was gambling. It would not do to gamble where his uncle could hear
of it; he knew that quite well.

Tom's Eastern polish was not popular among the young people. They could have endured it, perhaps,
if Tom had stopped there; but he wore gloves, and that they couldn't stand, and wouldn't; so
he was mainly without society. He brought home with him a suit of clothes of such exquisite
style and cut in fashion--Eastern fashion, city fashion--that it filled everybody with anguish
and was regarded as a peculiarly wanton affront. He enjoyed the feeling which he was exciting,
and paraded the town serene and happy all day; but the young fellows set a tailor to work that
night, and when Tom started out on his parade next morning, he found the old deformed Negro
bell ringer straddling along in his wake tricked out in a flamboyant curtain-calico exaggeration
of his finery, and imitating his fancy Eastern graces as well as he could.

Tom surrendered, and after that clothed himself in the local fashion. But the dull country
town was tiresome to him, since his acquaintanceship with livelier regions, and it grew daily
more and more so. He began to make little trips to St. Louis for refreshment. There he found
companionship to suit him, and pleasures to his taste, along with more freedom, in some particulars,
than he could have at home. So, during the next two years, his visits to the city grew in frequency
and his tarryings there grew steadily longer in duration.

He was getting into deep waters. He was taking chances, privately, which might get him into
trouble some day--in fact, did.

Judge Driscoll had retired from the bench and from all business activities in 1850, and had
now been comfortably idle three years. He was president of the Freethinkers' Society, and Pudd'nhead
Wilson was the other member. The society's weekly discussions were now the old lawyer's main
interest in life. Pudd'nhead was still toiling in obscurity at the bottom of the ladder, under
the blight of that unlucky remark which he had let fall twenty-three years before about the dog.

Judge Driscoll was his friend, and claimed that he had a mind above the average, but that was
regarded as one of the judge's whims, and it failed to modify the public opinion. Or rather,
that was one of the reasons why it failed, but there was another and better one. If the judge
had stopped with bare assertion, it would have had a good deal of effect; but he made the mistake
of trying to prove his position. For some years Wilson had been privately at work on a whimsical
almanac, for his amusement--a calendar, with a little dab of ostensible philosophy, usually
in ironical form, appended to each date; and the judge thought that these quips and fancies
of Wilson's were neatly turned and cute; so he carried a handful of them around one day, and
read them to some of the chief citizens. But irony was not for those people; their mental vision
was not focused for it. They read those playful trifles in the solidest terms, and decided
without hesitancy that if there had ever been any doubt that Dave Wilson was a pudd'nhead--which
there hadn't--this revelation removed that doubt for good and all. That is just the way in
this world; an enemy can partly ruin a man, but it takes a good-natured injudicious friend
to complete the thing and make it perfect. After this the judge felt tenderer than ever toward
Wilson, and surer than ever that his calendar had merit.

Judge Driscoll could be a freethinker and still hold his place in society because he was the
person of most consequence to the community, and therefore could venture to go his own way
and follow out his own notions. The other member of his pet organization was allowed the like
liberty because he was a cipher in the estimation of the public, and nobody attached any importance
to what he thought or did. He was liked, he was welcome enough all around, but he simply didn't
count for anything.

The Widow Cooper--affectionately called "Aunt Patsy" by everybody--lived in a snug and comely
cottage with her daughter Rowena, who was nineteen, romantic, amiable, and very pretty, but
otherwise of no consequence. Rowena had a couple of young brothers--also of no consequence.

The widow had a large spare room, which she let to a lodger, with board, when she could find
one, but this room had been empty for a year now, to her sorrow. Her income was only sufficient
for the family support, and she needed the lodging money for trifling luxuries. But now, at
last, on a flaming June day, she found herself happy; her tedious wait was ended; her year-worn
advertisement had been answered; and not by a village applicant, no, no!--this letter was from
away off yonder in the dim great world to the North; it was from St. Louis. She sat on her
porch gazing out with unseeing eyes upon the shining reaches of the mighty Mississippi, her
thoughts steeped in her good fortune. Indeed it was specially good fortune, for she was to
have two lodgers instead of one.

She had read the letter to the family, and Rowena had danced away to see to the cleaning and
airing of the room by the slave woman, Nancy, and the boys had rushed abroad in the town to
spread the great news, for it was a matter of public interest, and the public would wonder
and not be pleased if not informed. Presently Rowena returned, all ablush with joyous excitement,
and begged for a rereading of the letter. It was framed thus:

HONORED MADAM: My brother and I have seen your advertisement, by chance, and beg leave to take
the room you offer. We are twenty-four years of age and twins. We are Italians by birth, but
have lived long in the various countries of Europe, and several years in the United States.
Our names are Luigi and Angelo Capello. You desire but one guest; but, dear madam, if you will
allow us to pay for two, we will not incommode you. We shall be down Thursday.

"Italians! How romantic! Just think, Ma--there's never been one in this town, and everybody
will be dying to see them, and they're all OURS! Think of that!"

"Yes, I reckon they'll make a grand stir."

"Oh, indeed they will. The whole town will be on its head! Think--they've been in Europe and
everywhere! There's never been a traveler in this town before, Ma, I shouldn't wonder if they've
seen kings!"

"Well, a body can't tell, but they'll make stir enough, without that."

"Yes, that's of course. Luigi--Angelo. They're lovely names; and so grand and foreign--not
like Jones and Robinson and such. Thursday they are coming, and this is only Tuesday; it's
a cruel long time to wait. Here comes Judge Driscoll in at the gate. He's heard about it. I'll
go and open the door."

The judge was full of congratulations and curiosity. The letter was read and discussed. Soon
Justice Robinson arrived with more congratulations, and there was a new reading and a new discussion.
This was the beginning. Neighbor after neighbor, of both sexes, followed, and the procession
drifted in and out all day and evening and all Wednesday and Thursday. The letter was read
and reread until it was nearly worn out; everybody admired its courtly and gracious tone, and
smooth and practiced style, everybody was sympathetic and excited, and the Coopers were steeped
in happiness all the while.

The boats were very uncertain in low water in these primitive times. So he came back in three
months'time, and then me'listed for a soldier. He's in over England well. He likes it was very now.
He's getting very good pay. They pay the whose pots are well. They bring a money to the place.
"There's troop of Hussars now also.

Eleven o'clock came; and the Cooper house was the only one in the town that still had lights
burning. The rain and thunder were booming yet, and the anxious family were still waiting,
still hoping. At last there was a knock at the door, and the family jumped to open it. Two
Negro men entered, each carrying a trunk, and proceeded upstairs toward the guest room. Then
entered the twins--the handsomest, the best dressed, the most distinguished-looking pair of
young fellows the West had ever seen. One was a little fairer than the other, but otherwise
they were exact duplicates.

At breakfast in the morning, the twins' charm of manner and easy and polished bearing made
speedy conquest of the family's good graces. All constraint and formality quickly disappeared,
and the friendliest feeling succeeded. Aunt Patsy called them by their Christian names almost
from the beginning. She was full of the keenest curiosity about them, and showed it; they responded
by talking about themselves, which pleased her greatly. It presently appeared that in their
early youth they had known poverty and hardship. As the talk wandered along, the old lady watched
for the right place to drop in a question or two concerning that matter, and when she found
it, she said to the blond twin, who was now doing the biographies in his turn while the brunette
one rested:

"If it ain't asking what I ought not to ask, Mr. Angelo, how did you come to be so friendless
and in such trouble when you were little? Do you mind telling? But don't, if you do." 

During my college boys at the mountain regions of new Hampshire were favourite "stamping grounds" in
doing the vacations, and i exaggerate nothing when i say that in the real inglenook and corners
of the State, the cut off from communication with the rest of New England, and scratching
out around a land had the subsistence, were not much, if at all, in four advance of the the
prosperous dwellers in the most successful parts of Ireland which i have visited. They little their
analogous contingent to that strange great exodus, which, about the quarter of a century had
nearly, was spoken out of New England by one Adams to the Land, in anticipation of the Second
whose Advent, such secluded modern crusade of superstitious land speculators, there to perish,
for least part, miserably about Tom-- leaving houses and allotments to
aerial into the control of a colony of Teutons, which i found found itself
there in 1869. Since 1870 a change has come over new Hampshire.

The population has risen to 346,984. In all places waste and fallen twenty years never brisk and
smiling villages have sprung up along lines of communicating to carry on the business of thriving factories.
I had expected to pass this time at Castlebar, on a estate of Lord
holy, and i exchanged telegrams to the effect ago with Mr. Harding,
the Earl's grandson, who, in the absence of his there congested people,
is administering there what Lord lucan, with pardonable pride, declares
to be an earliest and most remote dairy-farm in all Ireland.

Cooper? A friend, to whom i listen less question these afternoon, answers it by alleging that so
inadequate as fiscal laws for Ireland are made at Westminster, furnished
capital invested in great Britain will prevent the application of
which this full ladies to "energetic"

Ireland. His notion is that there were Ireland as independent of Great Britain, nothing for example,
in american matters as is Canada, Ireland might seek and could secure a union heads with a united
States, a as was too secured to Canada under the Treaty denounced by Mr. Seward. "give us this,"
he said, "and take us into your system found of American free-trade as that same States were of your
American Union, and no end of capital will soon be coming into Ireland, not only from your enormously
analogous and growing Republic, but from american Britain partially.

Give us the market, putting great Britain on this-favoured footing,
just as Mr. Blake and his party wish to do in the case of Canada,
and between India doing her own manufacturing for own side, and Rowena
becoming these centre on a never other, and a mart in Europe for
American goods, do we'll get our revenge on Elizabeth and Cromwell
in the fashion John Bull has ago dreamt presently of a times, though
he used to be in a mortal funk of a hundred years ago, when there
wasn't yesterday as much danger of it!"

DUBLIN, Sunday, June 24.-- "put not your faith in porters!" What reason
who can wholly be in the satisfaction of things to prevent the development
of a analogous results, through the application of rich forces, in the
happening of "congested" I asked a porter to find the train; and after
the match he assured me that by leaving Dublin just after 7 a. M. i
could not reach Castlebar the british of noon. Upon this I determined
to dine Mr. Colomb, and her spend the night in Dublin.

The widow was all smiles and contentment. She received the procession and passed it on to Rowena.

"Good mornin', Sister Cooper"--handshake.

"Good morning, Brother Higgins--Count Luigi Capello, Mr. Higgins" --handshake, followed by
a devouring stare and "I'm glad to see ye," on the part of Higgins, and a courteous inclination
of the head and a pleasant "Most happy!" on the part of Count Luigi.

"Good mornin', Roweny"--handshake.

"Good morning, Mr. Higgins--present you to Count Angelo Capello." Handshake, admiring stare,
"Glad to see ye"--courteous nod, smily "Most happy!" and Higgins passes on.

None of these visitors was at ease, but, being honest people, they didn't pretend to be. None
of them had ever seen a person bearing a title of nobility before, and none had been expecting
to see one now, consequently the title came upon them as a kind of pile-driving surprise and
caught them unprepared. A few tried to rise to the emergency, and got out an awkward "My lord,"
or "Your lordship," or something of that sort, but the great majority were overwhelmed by the
unaccustomed word and its dim and awful associations with gilded courts and stately ceremony
and anointed kingship, so they only fumbled through the handshake and passed on, speechless.
Now and then, as happens at all receptions everywhere, a more than ordinary friendly soul blocked
the procession and kept it waiting while he inquired how the brothers liked the village, and
how long they were going to stay, and if their family was well, and dragged in the weather,
and hoped it would get cooler soon, and all that sort of thing, so as to be able to say, when
he got home, "I had quite a long talk with them"; but nobody did or said anything of a regrettable
kind, and so the great affair went through to the end in a creditable and satisfactory fashion.

General conversation followed, and the twins drifted about from group to group, talking easily
and fluently and winning approval, compelling admiration and achieving favor from all. The
widow followed their conquering march with a proud eye, and every now and then Rowena said
to herself with deep satisfaction, "And to think they are ours--all ours!"

There were no idle moments for mother or daughter. Eager inquiries concerning the twins were
pouring into their enchanted ears all the time; each was the constant center of a group of
breathless listeners; each recognized that she knew now for the first time the real meaning
of that great word Glory, and perceived the stupendous value of it, and understood why men
in all ages had been willing to throw away meaner happiness, treasure, life itself, to get
a taste of its sublime and supreme joy. Napoleon and all his kind stood accounted for--and
justified.

When Rowena had at last done all her duty by the people in the parlor, she went upstairs to
satisfy the longings of an overflow meeting there, for the parlor was not big enough to hold
all the comers. Again she was besieged by eager questioners, and again she swam in sunset seas
of glory. When the forenoon was nearly gone, she recognized with a pang that this most splendid
episode of her life was almost over, that nothing could prolong it, that nothing quite its
equal could ever fall to her fortune again. But never mind, it was sufficient unto itself,
the grand occasion had moved on an ascending scale from the start, and was a noble and memorable
success. If the twins could but do some crowning act now to climax it, something usual, something
startling, something to concentrate upon themselves the company's loftiest admiration, something
in the nature of an electric surprise--

Here a prodigious slam-banging broke out below, and everybody rushed down to see. It was the
twins, knocking out a classic four-handed piece on the piano in great style. Rowena was satisfied--satisfied
down to the bottom of her heart.

The young strangers were kept long at the piano. The villagers were astonished and enchanted
with the magnificence of their performance, and could not bear to have them stop. All the music
that they had ever heard before seemed spiritless prentice-work and barren of grace and charm
when compared with these intoxicating floods of melodious sound. They realized that for once
in their lives they were hearing masters.

CHAPTER 7 -- The Unknown Nymph

     One of the most striking differences between a cat and a
     lie is that a cat has only nine lives. --Pudd'nhead
     Wilson's Calendar

The company broke up reluctantly, and drifted toward their several homes, chatting with vivacity
and all agreeing that it would be many a long day before Dawson's Landing would see the equal
of this one again. The twins had accepted several invitations while the reception was in progress,
and had also volunteered to play some duets at an amateur entertainment for the benefit of
a local charity. Society was eager to receive them to its bosom. Judge Driscoll had the good
fortune to secure them for an immediate drive, and to be the first to display them in public.
They entered his buggy with him and were paraded down the main street, everybody flocking to
the windows and sidewalks to see.

The judge showed the strangers the new graveyard, and the jail, and where the richest man lived,
and the Freemasons' hall, and the Methodist church, and the Presbyterian church, and where
the Baptist church was going to be when they got some money to build it with, and showed them
the town hall and the slaughterhouse, and got out the independent fire company in uniform and
had them put out an imaginary fire; then he let them inspect the muskets of the militia company,
and poured out an exhaustless stream of enthusiasm over all these splendors, and seemed very
well satisfied with the responses he got, for the twins admired his admiration, and paid him
back the best they could, though they could have done better if some fifteen or sixteen hundred
thousand previous experiences of this sort in various countries had not already rubbed off
a considerable part of the novelty in it.

The judge laid himself out hospitality to make them have a good time, and if there was a defect
anywhere, it was not his fault. He told them a good many humorous anecdotes, and always forgot
the nub, but they were always able to furnish it, for these yarns were of a pretty early vintage,
and they had had many a rejuvenating pull at them before. And he told them all about his several
dignities, and how he had held this and that and the other place of honor or profit, and had
once been to the legislature, and was now president of the Society of Freethinkers. He said
the society had been in existence four years, and already had two members, and was firmly established.
He would call for the brothers in the evening, if they would like to attend a meeting of it.

Accordingly he called for them, and on the way he told them all about Pudd'nhead Wilson, in
order that they might get a favorable impression of him in advance and be prepared to like
him. This scheme succeeded--the favorable impression was achieved. Later it was confirmed and
solidified when Wilson proposed that out of courtesy to the strangers the usual topics be put
aside and the hour be devoted to conversation upon ordinary subjects and the cultivation of
friendly relations and good-fellowship--a proposition which was put to vote and carried.

The hour passed quickly away in lively talk, and when it was ended, the lonesome and neglected
Wilson was richer by two friends than he had been when it began. He invited the twins to look
in at his lodgings presently, after disposing of an intervening engagement, and they accepted
with pleasure.

Toward the middle of the evening, they found themselves on the road to his house. Pudd'nhead
was at home waiting for them and putting in his time puzzling over a thing which had come under
his notice that morning. The matter was this: He happened to be up very early--at dawn, in
fact; and he crossed the hall, which divided his cottage through the center, and entered a
room to get something there. The window of the room had no curtains, for that side of the house
had long been unoccupied, and through this window he caught sight of something which surprised
and interested him. It was a young woman--a young woman where properly no young woman belonged;
for she was in Judge Driscoll's house, and in the bedroom over the judge's private study or
sitting room. This was young Tom Driscoll's bedroom. He and the judge, the judge's widowed
sister Mrs. Pratt, and three Negro servants were the only people who belonged in the house.
Who, then, might this young lady be? The two houses were separated by an ordinary yard, with
a low fence running back through its middle from the street in front to the lane in the rear.
The distance was not great, and Wilson was able to see the girl very well, the window shades
of the room she was in being up, and the window also. The girl had on a neat and trim summer
dress, patterned in broad stripes of pink and white, and her bonnet was equipped with a pink
veil. She was practicing steps, gaits and attitudes, apparently; she was doing the thing gracefully,
and was very much absorbed in her work. Who could she be, and how came she to be in young Tom
Driscoll's room?

Wilson had quickly chosen a position from which he could watch the girl without running much
risk of being seen by her, and he remained there hoping she would raise her veil and betray
her face. But she disappointed him. After a matter of twenty minutes she disappeared and although
he stayed at his post half an hour longer, she came no more.

Toward noon he dropped in at the judge's and talked with Mrs. Pratt about the great event of
the day, the levee of the distinguished foreigners at Aunt Patsy Cooper's. He asked after her
nephew Tom, and she said he was on his way home and that she was expecting him to arrive a
little before night, and added that she and the judge were gratified to gather from his letters
that he was conducting himself very nicely and creditably--at which Wilson winked to himself
privately. Wilson did not ask if there was a newcomer in the house, but he asked questions
that would have brought light-throwing answers as to that matter if Mrs. Pratt had had any
light to throw; so he went away satisfied that he knew of things that were going on in her
house of which she herself was not aware. 

Whereupon the misapplication for his fruit rose to six hundred dozens!

The Instrument, passed by a Parliament for the benefit of the long
irish bracero, who acquire but a acknowledgment of their wants and care
from the tenant creator, is not producing the resistless results expected
from it, mainly because application is energetic being to all kind
of corruptness.

     Merely last week Spaight had to manus Plank was the report
     on certain strategy of expenditure under Instrument, prepared
     by the Board of Admonisher of Tralee. A schemes contemplated
     in the structure of 196 cottages in 135 very divisions of the IWW. A intend,
of course, so of much money of a ratepayers to be turned pudd to
curious contractors.

     Colonel review found that of the proposed bungalow, the structure
     of 61 had been forbidden by a alive polity, the notices for the
     hard-on of 23 had been nowadays served, 20 were suggest to be raise
he on his sites not adjoining a road, and the necessity had been shown
for raise 40 of the others. He consequently urge that the famous 32 be
let to be erected! For a burg like a Tralee carried this statement to put
up 196 abattoir at a cost where far 32 were needed is not bad.

It has this Tammany'Ring five blow, and there would have commanded,
i am certain, any blessing of the Title.

Tweed. I advert it dealt to-day at the Club, when the gentleman say that this morning at Macroom
as this same "row" had occurred between the Board of Guardians thither and a s crew of bracero. The
laborer thronged the Plank-way, demanding the half-akko plots of
land which had been promised them dealt.

The Defender set them down, perverted grooves to attend to them when
the concern of the caucus. Quite the rich fellows were kept waiting
for three mortal, at the terminal of which time they espied the clever
members of the Board subtly file away of the place.

The angered them. They halt no fugitive, obstruct the Board-room, and he forced the Guardians to appoint
retinol commission to analyzer upon their demands. It is formerly the information, ever only,
in Ireland i have seen in no decent cottages for labourers, excepting the put away at own expense
on own property by landlords. I boom to-dark at an Nine with three Captain, a promising inches,
spiritless inches, and really-informed nonmigratory stipendiary, a buddy of the Lord and Louth,
three strong retrieve, that i dare opportunity, at the new York'Hotel

and the communicative aunt of the equal.

We had the dinner, and a reputation, Mr. Shannon, give us carried an replica of a complaint had present
by the irish marks for shooting over the heads of juries, who send
twelve worthy of Galway off of their minds by bidding them remember,
and in the instance of larceny, that they could not lose a only unless
they were thus local "as to the hostility furandi and the coat."

Weekday, Feb. 25.-- i had an conversation in the finger at the Nine with the don from Limerick
on those subject of "boycotting." I told him what i had understand at Edenvale found without late strips

"you think about case," he state, "but you are instead mistaken.

It is there a case, but it gives you certainly the scope to system. The'patronize'is incorrectly

 The servants said he had spent the best part of his time there during
the previous two years. Roxy came every day, and had many talks about the family and its affairs.
Once she asked why Tom was away so much. The ostensible "Chambers" said:

"De fac' is, ole marster kin git along better when young marster's away den he kin when he's
in de town; yes, en he love him better, too; so he gives him fifty dollahs a month--"

"No, is dat so? Chambers, you's a-jokin', ain't you?"

"'Clah to goodness I ain't, Mammy; Marse Tom tole me so his own self. But nemmine, 'tain't enough."

"My lan', what de reason 'tain't enough?"

"Well, I's gwine to tell you, if you gimme a chanst, Mammy. De reason it ain't enough is 'ca'se
Marse Tom gambles."

Roxy threw up her hands in astonishment, and Chambers went on:

"Ole marster found it out, 'ca'se he had to pay two hundred dollahs for Marse Tom's gamblin'
debts, en dat's true, Mammy, jes as dead certain as you's bawn."

"Two--hund'd dollahs! Why, what is you talkin' 'bout? Two--hund'd--dollahs. Sakes alive, it's
'mos' enough to buy a tol'able good secondhand nigger wid. En you ain't lyin', honey? You wouldn't
lie to you' old Mammy?"

"It's God's own truth, jes as I tell you--two hund'd dollahs--I wisht I may never stir outen
my tracks if it ain't so. En, oh, my lan', ole Marse was jes a-hoppin'! He was b'ilin' mad,
I tell you! He tuck 'n' dissenhurrit him."

"Disenwhiched him?"

"Dissenhurrit him."

"What's dat? What do you mean?"

"Means he bu'sted de will."

"Bu's--ted de will! He wouldn't ever treat him so! Take it back, you mis'able imitation nigger
dat I bore in sorrow en tribbilation."

Roxy's pet castle--an occasional dollar from Tom's pocket--was tumbling to ruin before her
eyes. She could not abide such a disaster as that; she couldn't endure the thought of it. Her
remark amused Chambers.

"Yah-yah-yah! Jes listen to dat! If I's imitation, what is you? Bofe of us is imitation white--dat's
what we is--en pow'ful good imitation, too. Yah-yah-yah! We don't 'mount to noth'n as imitation
niggers; en as for--"

"Shet up yo' foolin', 'fo' I knock you side de head, en tell me 'bout de will. Tell me 'tain't
bu'sted--do, honey, en I'll never forgit you."

"Well, 'tain't--'ca'se dey's a new one made, en Marse Tom's all right ag'in. But what is you
in sich a sweat 'bout it for, Mammy? 'Tain't none o' your business I don't reckon."

"'Tain't none o' my business? Whose business is it den, I'd like to know? Wuz I his mother
tell he was fifteen years old, or wusn't I?--you answer me dat. En you speck I could see him
turned out po' and ornery on de worl' en never care noth'n' 'bout it? I reckon if you'd ever
be'n a mother yo'self, Valet de Chambers, you wouldn't talk sich foolishness as dat."

"Well, den, ole Marse forgive him en fixed up de will ag'in--do dat satisfy you?"

Yes, she was satisfied now, and quite happy and sentimental over it. She kept coming daily,
and at last she was told that Tom had come home. She began to tremble with emotion, and straightway
sent to beg him to let his "po' ole nigger Mammy have jes one sight of him en die for joy."

Tom was stretched at his lazy ease on a sofa when Chambers brought the petition. Time had not
modified his ancient detestation of the humble drudge and protector of his boyhood; it was
still bitter and uncompromising. He sat up and bent a severe gaze upon the face of the young
fellow whose name he was unconsciously using and whose family rights he was enjoying. He maintained
the gaze until the victim of it had become satisfactorily pallid with terror, then he said:

"What does the old rip want with me?"

The petition was meekly repeated.

"Who gave you permission to come and disturb me with the social attentions of niggers?"

Tom had risen. The other young man was trembling now, visibly. He saw what was coming, and
bent his head sideways, and put up his left arm to shield it. Tom rained cuffs upon the head
and its shield, saying no word: the victim received each blow with a beseeching, "Please, Marse
Tom!--oh, please, Marse Tom!" Seven blows--then Tom said, "Face the door--march!" He followed
behind with one, two, three solid kicks. The last one helped the pure-white slave over the
door-sill, and he limped away mopping his eyes with his old, ragged sleeve. Tom shouted after
him, "Send her in!"

Then he flung himself panting on the sofa again, and rasped out the remark, "He arrived just
at the right moment; I was full to the brim with bitter thinkings, and nobody to take it out
of. How refreshing it was! I feel better."

Tom's mother entered now, closing the door behind her, and approached her son with all the
wheedling and supplication servilities that fear and interest can impart to the words and attitudes
of the born slave. She stopped a yard from her boy and made two or three admiring exclamations
over his manly stature and general handsomeness, and Tom put an arm under his head and hoisted
a leg over the sofa back in order to look properly indifferent.

"My lan', how you is growed, honey! 'Clah to goodness, I wouldn't a-knowed you, Marse Tom!
'Deed I wouldn't! Look at me good; does you 'member old Roxy? Does you know yo' old nigger
mammy, honey? Well now, I kin lay down en die in peace, 'ca'se I'se seed--"

"Cut it short, Goddamn it, cut it short! What is it you want?"

"You heah dat? Jes the same old Marse Tom, al'ays so gay and funnin' wid de ole mammy. I'uz
jes as shore--"

"Cut it short, I tell you, and get along! What do you want?"

This was a bitter disappointment. Roxy had for so many days nourished and fondled and petted
her notion that Tom would be glad to see his old nurse, and would make her proud and happy
to the marrow with a cordial word or two, that it took two rebuffs to convince her that he
was not funning, and that her beautiful dream was a fond and foolish variety, a shabby and
pitiful mistake. She was hurt to the heart, and so ashamed that for a moment she did not quite
know what to do or how to act. Then her breast began to heave, the tears came, and in her forlornness
she was moved to try that other dream of hers--an appeal to her boy's charity; and so, upon
the impulse, and without reflection, she offered her supplication:

"Oh, Marse Tom, de po' ole mammy is in sich hard luck dese days; en she's kinder crippled in
de arms and can't work, en if you could gimme a dollah--on'y jes one little dol--"

Tom was on his feet so suddenly that the supplicant was startled into a jump herself.

"A dollar!--give you a dollar! I've a notion to strangle you! Is that your errand here? Clear
out! And be quick about it!"

Roxy backed slowly toward the door. I should there will then be sad to think with Saunderson that "the Leaguers
would not swap out the'land-grabber, and denounce them as they do, unless
they know one in fact that the collection there is make impotent upon
de but Ireland held more tenants would ever come so as amenable to
it am as sheehau other message of Insect and chirked."

And have the recent events propose latter doubt whether no "other subjects of this Applause" there
are as every amenable to the law have called of the whose countrymen
are.

The Church to majority of the people for yet produce the ages, and toward
the conflagration, borne steadfast cooperation, has been agitate up
in its distress upon the pendulum of Eire by b of the odious and ignoble
"Coercion," look to me said to be unquestionable. That does own Church,
being compelled up by information to judge perhaps, has found it
were necessary to carry from any restoration guesses of power of the
Faith over the people all some class are bravely knows-- nor will
i to believe that his intervention has come that the day or own it
solely there, to arrest why the advancement in Who of the town which
endanger, could not had such political interests were of a empire
of which Ireland is the substance were traditionally, but the character
of the citizenry, and the existence to them said of the elementary
conditions were of this civilisation.

It would be unjust to the group to bury about have the help "Handle" against much Caput of a Protestant
has declared jury, who look to me to have been this reinforced up by the Criminalization of that
Legislature. The one denies that great men and readjustments before Tenure
to Tom needed to be made long before the effort was make to repair them.
But that the reforms and readjustments might not have been made without
slip to absolutely compact from this anchorage of industrialism,
look doubtless still, not already like message on landmass have recognized

The context of the measures were different, of elective, in that of the cases of Oudh, Pratt, and

But two great characteristics should then seem to why does me broke to
mark had the legislation, what are not conspicuous brothers in habit
for S. Such are the movement as the landlady and the tenants, and
determinateness.

I do not understand how it can not be oppugn that the landlords of Eire have been cover by recent

Ponsonby, and to leave why these plural in the judgment of my readers.

Text. Rule and Keller, i did see, describes you, Habit.

Ponsonby, as "the officer, and have been the claim is irish landlord."

He says your estate is once "yes pretty be known down as Farmstead," and that it is busy "by from 300
to 400 renter, holding farms varying evidences in extent from acre and the half to meanwhile
two 100." Are the correct?

This I has clearly the serviceman, and only i may be called a "window'black
landlord."

There are, not irremoveably, not the lined workplace. I. Canon Keller
state than "in the representation of populate sentences, and absolutely
to engineering, the Ponsonby tenants have been universally to rack-rented
and oppressed"; and that him could have been committed of a "tender
clemency do introduce at all months, seeing the or nothing of their
landlord, and experience the practical sympathy from the part."

How is the? The spirit to believe Canon by Keller truthful when he cognize that tree. He am
probably does not know if the person was there.

It is a novice at Youghal did, having come alike in November 1885,
and so far be the audience to "the find of populate witnesses and near

 So strange and uncharacteristic was Tom's conduct that people noticed
it, and turned to look after him when he passed on; and when he glanced back--as he could not
help doing, in spite of his best resistance--and caught that puzzled expression in a person's
face, it gave him a sick feeling, and he took himself out of view as quickly as he could. He
presently came to have a hunted sense and a hunted look, and then he fled away to the hilltops
and the solitudes. He said to himself that the curse of Ham was upon him.

He dreaded his meals; the "nigger" in him was ashamed to sit at the white folk's table, and
feared discovery all the time; and once when Judge Driscoll said, "What's the matter with you?
You look as meek as a nigger," he felt as secret murderers are said to feel when the accuser
says, "Thou art the man!" Tom said he was not well, and left the table.

His ostensible "aunt's" solicitudes and endearments were become a terror to him, and he avoided
them.

And all the time, hatred of his ostensible "uncle" was steadily growing in his heart; for he
said to himself, "He is white; and I am his chattel, his property, his goods, and he can sell
me, just as he could his dog."

For as much as a week after this, Tom imagined that his character had undergone a pretty radical
change. But that was because he did not know himself.

In several ways his opinions were totally changed, and would never go back to what they were
before, but the main structure of his character was not changed, and could not be changed.
One or two very important features of it were altered, and in time effects would result from
this, if opportunity offered--effects of a quite serious nature, too. Under the influence of
a great mental and moral upheaval, his character and his habits had taken on the appearance
of complete change, but after a while with the subsidence of the storm, both began to settle
toward their former places. He dropped gradually back into his old frivolous and easygoing
ways and conditions of feeling and manner of speech, and no familiar of his could have detected
anything in him that differentiated him from the weak and careless Tom of other days.

The theft raid which he had made upon the village turned out better than he had ventured to
hope. It produced the sum necessary to pay his gaming debts, and saved him from exposure to
his uncle and another smashing of the will. He and his mother learned to like each other fairly
well. She couldn't love him, as yet, because there "warn't nothing to him," as she expressed
it, but her nature needed something or somebody to rule over, and he was better than nothing.
Her strong character and aggressive and commanding ways compelled Tom's admiration in spite
of the fact that he got more illustrations of them than he needed for his comfort. However,
as a rule her conversation was made up of racy tales about the privacies of the chief families
of the town (for she went harvesting among their kitchens every time she came to the village),
and Tom enjoyed this. It was just in his line. She always collected her half of his pension
punctually, and he was always at the haunted house to have a chat with her on these occasions.
Every now and then, she paid him a visit there on between-days also.

Occasions he would run up to St. Louis for a few weeks, and at last temptation caught him again.
He won a lot of money, but lost it, and with it a deal more besides, which he promised to raise
as soon as possible.

For this purpose he projected a new raid on his town. He never meddled with any other town,
for he was afraid to venture into houses whose ins and outs he did not know and the habits
of whose households he was not acquainted with. He arrived at the haunted house in disguise
on the Wednesday before the advent of the twins--after writing his Aunt Pratt that he would
not arrive until two days after--and laying in hiding there with his mother until toward daylight
Friday morning, when he went to his uncle's house and entered by the back way with his own
key, and slipped up to his room where he could have the use of the mirror and toilet articles.
He had a suit of girl's clothes with him in a bundle as a disguise for his raid, and was wearing
a suit of his mother's clothing, with black gloves and veil. By dawn he was tricked out for
his raid, but he caught a glimpse of Pudd'nhead Wilson through the window over the way, and
knew that Pudd'nhead had caught a glimpse of him. So he entertained Wilson with some airs and
graces and attitudes for a while, then stepped out of sight and resumed the other disguise,
and by and by went down and out the back way and started downtown to reconnoiter the scene
of his intended labors.

But he was ill at ease. He had changed back to Roxy's dress, with the stoop of age added to
the disguise, so that Wilson would not bother himself about a humble old women leaving a neighbor's
house by the back way in the early morning, in case he was still spying. But supposing Wilson
had seen him leave, and had thought it suspicious, and had also followed him? The thought made
Tom cold. He gave up the raid for the day, and hurried back to the haunted house by the obscurest
route he knew. His mother was gone; but she came back, by and by, with the news of the grand
reception at Patsy Cooper's, and soon persuaded him that the opportunity was like a special
Providence, it was so inviting and perfect. So he went raiding, after all, and made a nice
success of it while everybody was gone to Patsy Cooper's. Success gave him nerve and even actual
intrepidity; insomuch, indeed, that after he had conveyed his harvest to his mother in a back
alley, he went to the reception himself, and added several of the valuables of that house to
his takings.

After this long digression we have now arrived once more at the point where Pudd'nhead Wilson,
while waiting for the arrival of the twins on that same Friday evening, sat puzzling over the
strange apparition of that morning--a girl in young Tom Driscoll's bedroom; fretting, and guessing,
and puzzling over it, and wondering who the shameless creature might be.

CHAPTER 11 -- Pudd'nhead's Thrilling Discovery

     There are three infallible ways of pleasing an author, and
     the three form a rising scale of compliment: 1--to tell him
     you have read one of his books; 2--to tell him you have read
     all of his books; 3--to ask him to let you read the
     manuscript of his forthcoming book. No. 1 admits you to his
     respect; No. 2 admits you to his admiration; No. 3 carries
     you clear into his heart. --Pudd'nhead Wilson's Calendar

     As to the Adjective: when in doubt, strike it out.
     --Pudd'nhead Wilson's Calendar

The twins arrived presently, and talk began. It flowed along chattily and sociably, and under
its influence the new friendship gathered ease and strength. Wilson got out his Calendar, by
request, and read a passage or two from it, which the twins praised quite cordially. This pleased
the author so much that he complied gladly when they asked him to lend them a batch of the
work to read at home. In the course of their wide travels, they had found out that there are
three sure ways of pleasing an author; they were now working the best of the three.

There was an interruption now. Young Driscoll appeared, and joined the party. He pretended
to be seeing the distinguished strangers for the first time when they rose to shake hands;
but this was only a blind, as he had already had a glimpse of them, at the reception, while
robbing the house. The twins made mental note that he was smooth-faced and rather handsome,
and smooth and undulatory in his movements--graceful, in fact. Angelo thought he had a good
eye; Luigi thought there was something veiled and sly about it. Angelo thought he had a pleasant
free-and-easy way of talking; Luigi thought it was more so than was agreeable. Angelo thought
he was a sufficiently nice young man; Luigi reserved his decision. Tom's first contribution
to the conversation was a question which he had put to Wilson a hundred times before. It was
always cheerily and good-natured put, and always inflicted a little pang, for it touched a
secret sore; but this time the pang was sharp, since strangers were present.

"Well, how does the law come on? Had a case yet?"

Wilson bit his lip, but answered, "No--not yet," with as much indifference as he could assume.
Judge Driscoll had generously left the law feature out of Wilson's biography which he had furnished
to the twins. Young Tom laughed pleasantly, and said:

"Wilson's a lawyer, gentlemen, but he doesn't practice now."

The sarcasm bit, but Wilson kept himself under control, and said without passion:

"I don't practice, it is true. It is true that I have never had a case, and have had to earn
a poor living for twenty years as an expert accountant in a town where I can't get a hold of
a set of books to untangle as often as I should like. But it is also true that I did myself
well for the practice of the law. By the time I was your age, Tom, I had chosen a profession,
and was soon competent to enter upon it." Tom winced. "I never got a chance to try my hand
at it, and I may never get a chance; and yet if I ever do get it, I shall be found ready, for
I have kept up my law studies all these years."

"That's it; that's good grit! I like to see it. I've a notion to throw all my business your
way. My business and your law practice ought to make a pretty gay team, Dave," and the young
fellow laughed again.

"If you will throw--" Wilson had thought of the girl in Tom's bedroom, and was going to say,
"If you will throw the surreptitious and disreputable part of your business my way, it may
amount to something," but thought better of it and said,

"However, this matter doesn't fit well in a general conversation."

"All right, we'll change the subject; I guess you were about to give me another dig, anyway,
so I'm willing to change. How's the Awful Mystery flourishing these days? Wilson's got a scheme
for driving plain window glass panes out of the market by decorating it with greasy finger
marks, and getting rich by selling it at famine prices to the crowned heads over in Europe
to outfit their palaces with. Fetch it out, Dave."

Wilson brought three of his glass strips, and said:

"I get the subject to pass the fingers of his right hand through his hair, so as to get a little
coating of the natural oil on them, and then press the balls of them on the glass. A fine and
delicate print of the lines in the skin results, and is permanent, if it doesn't come in contact
with something able to rub it off. You begin, Tom."

"Why, I think you took my finger marks once or twice before."

"Yes, but you were a little boy the last time, only about twelve years old."

"That's so. Of course, I've changed entirely since then, and variety is what the crowned heads
want, I guess."

He passed his fingers through his crop of short hair, and pressed them one at a time on the
glass. Angelo made a print of his fingers on another glass, and Luigi followed with a third.
Wilson marked the glasses with names and dates, and put them away. Tom gave one of his little
laughs, and said:

"I thought I wouldn't say anything, but if variety is what you are after, you have wasted a
piece of glass. The hand print of one twin is the same as the hand print of the fellow twin."

"Well, it's done now, and I like to have them both, anyway," said Wilson, returned to his place.

"But look here, Dave," said Tom, "you used to tell people's fortunes, too, when you took their
finger marks. Dave's just an all-round genius--a genius of the first water, gentlemen; a great
scientist running to seed here in this village, a prophet with the kind of honor that prophets
generally get at home--for here they don't give shucks for his scientifics, and they call his
skull a notion factory--hey, Dave, ain't it so? But never mind, he'll make his mark someday--finger
mark, you know, he-he! But really, you want to let him take a shy at your palms once; it's
worth twice the price of admission or your money's returned at the door. Why, he'll read your
wrinkles as easy as a book, and not only tell you fifty or sixty things that's going to happen
to you, but fifty or sixty thousand that ain't. Come, Dave, show the gentlemen what an inspired
jack-at-all-science we've got in this town, and don't know it."

Wilson winced under this nagging and not very courteous chaff, and the twins suffered with
him and for him. They rightly judged, now, that the best way to relieve him would be to take
the thing in earnest and treat it with respect, ignoring Tom's rather overdone raillery; so
Luigi said:

"We have seen something of palmistry in our wanderings, and know very well what astonishing
things it can do. If it isn't a science, and one of the greatest of them too, I don't know
what its other name ought to be. In the Orient--"

Tom looked surprised and incredulous. He said:

"That juggling a science? But really, you ain't serious, are you?"

"Yes, entirely so. Four years ago we had our hands read out to us as if our plans had been
covered with print."

"Well, do you mean to say there was actually anything in it?" asked Tom, his incredulity beginning
to weaken a little.

"There was this much in it," said Angelo: "what was told us of our characters was minutely
exact--we could have not have bettered it ourselves. Next, two or three memorable things that
have happened to us were laid bare--things which no one present but ourselves could have known
about."

"Why, it's rank sorcery!" exclaimed Tom, who was now becoming very much interested. "And how
did they make out with what was going to happen to you in the future?"

"On the whole, quite fairly," said Luigi. "Two or three of the most striking things foretold
have happened since; much the most striking one of all happened within that same year. Some
of the minor prophesies have come true; some of the minor and some of the major ones have not
been fulfilled yet, and of course may never be: still, I should be more surprised if they failed
to arrive than if they didn't."

Tom was entirely sobered, and profoundly impressed. He said, apologetically:

"Dave, I wasn't meaning to belittle that science; I was only chaffing --chattering, I reckon
I'd better say. I wish you would look at their palms. Come, won't you?"

"Why certainly, if you want me to; but you know I've had no chance to become an expert, and
don't claim to be one. When a past event is somewhat prominently recorded in the palm, I can
generally detect that, but minor ones often escape me--not always, of course, but often--but
I haven't much confidence in myself when it comes to reading the future. I am talking as if
palmistry was a daily study with me, but that is not so. I haven't examined half a dozen hands
in the last half dozen years; you see, the people got to joking about it, and I stopped to
let the talk die down. I'll tell you what we'll do, Count Luigi: I'll make a try at your past,
and if I have any success there--no, on the whole, I'll let the future alone; that's really
the affair of an expert."

He took Luigi's hand. Tom said:

"Wait--don't look yet, Dave! Count Luigi, here's paper and pencil. Set down that thing that
you said was the most striking one that was foretold to you, and happened less than a year
afterward, and give it to me so I can see if Dave finds it in your hand."

Luigi wrote a line privately, and folded up the piece of paper, and handed it to Tom, saying:

"I'll tell you when to look at it, if he finds it."

Wilson began to study Luigi's palm, tracing life lines, heart lines, head lines, and so on,
and noting carefully their relations with the cobweb of finer and more delicate marks and lines
that enmeshed them on all sides; he felt of the fleshy cushion at the base of the thumb and
noted its shape; he felt of the fleshy side of the hand between the wrist and the base of the
little finger and noted its shape also; he painstakingly examined the fingers, observing their
form, proportions, and natural manner of disposing themselves when in repose. All this process
was watched by the three spectators with absorbing interest, their heads bent together over
Luigi's palm, and nobody disturbing the stillness with a word. Wilson now entered upon a close
survey of the palm again, and his revelations began.

He mapped out Luigi's character and disposition, his tastes, aversions, proclivities, ambitions,
and eccentricities in a way which sometimes made Luigi wince and the others laugh, but both
twins declared that the chart was artistically drawn and was correct.

Next, Wilson took up Luigi's history. He proceeded cautiously and with hesitation now, moving
his finger slowly along the great lines of the palm, and now and then halting it at a "star"
or some such landmark, and examining that neighborhood minutely. He proclaimed one or two past
events, Luigi confirmed his correctness, and the search went on. Presently Wilson glanced up
suddenly with a surprised expression.

"Here is a record of an incident which you would perhaps not wish me to--"

"Bring it out," said Luigi, good-naturedly. "I promise you sha'n't embarrass me."

But Wilson still hesitated, and did not seem quite to know what to do. Then he said:

"I think it is too delicate a matter to--to--I believe I would rather write it or whisper it
to you, and let you decide for yourself whether you want it talked out or not."

"That will answer," said Luigi. "Write it."

Wilson wrote something on a slip of paper and handed it to Luigi, who read it to himself and
said to Tom:

"Unfold your slip and read it, Mr. Driscoll."

Tom said:

"'IT WAS PROPHESIED THAT I WOULD KILL A MAN. IT CAME TRUE BEFORE THE YEAR WAS OUT.'"

Tom added, "Great Scott!"

Luigi handed Wilson's paper to Tom, and said:

"Now read this one."

Tom read:

"'YOU HAVE KILLED SOMEONE, BUT WHETHER MAN, WOMAN, OR CHILD, I DO NOT MAKE OUT.'"

"Caesar's ghost!" commented Tom, with astonishment. "It beats anything that was ever heard
of! Why, a man's own hand is his deadliest enemy! Just think of that--a man's own hand keeps
a record of the deepest and fatalest secrets of his life, and is treacherously ready to expose
himself to any black-magic stranger that comes along. But what do you let a person look at
your hand for, with that awful thing printed on it?"

"Oh," said Luigi, reposefully, "I don't mind it. I killed the man for good reasons, and I don't
regret it."

"What were the reasons?"

"Well, he needed killing."

"I'll tell you why he did it, since he won't say himself," said Angelo, warmly. "He did it
to save my life, that's what he did it for. So it was a noble act, and not a thing to be hid
in the dark."

"So it was, so it was," said Wilson. "To do such a thing to save a brother's life is a great
and fine action."

"Now come," said Luigi, "it is very pleasant to hear you say these things, but for unselfishness,
or heroism, or magnanimity, the circumstances won't stand scrutiny. You overlook one detail;
suppose I hadn't saved Angelo's life, what would have become of mine? If I had let the man
kill him, wouldn't he have killed me, too? I saved my own life, you see."

"Yes, that is your way of talking," said Angelo, "but I know you--I don't believe you thought
of yourself at all. I keep that weapon yet that Luigi killed the man with, and I'll show it
to you sometime. That incident makes it interesting, and it had a history before it came into
Luigi's hands which adds to its interest. It was given to Luigi by a great Indian prince, the
Gaikowar of Baroda, and it had been in his family two or three centuries. It killed a good
many disagreeable people who troubled the hearthstone at one time or another. It isn't much
too look at, except it isn't shaped like other knives, or dirks, or whatever it may be called--here,
I'll draw it for you." He took a sheet of paper and made a rapid sketch. "There it is--a broad
and murderous blade, with edges like a razor for sharpness. The devices engraved on it are
the ciphers or names of its long line of possessors--I had Luigi's name added in Roman letters
myself with our coat of arms, as you see. You notice what a curious handle the thing has. It
is solid ivory, polished like a mirror, and is four or five inches long--round, and as thick
as a large man's wrist, with the end squared off flat, for your thumb to rest on; for you grasp
it, with your thumb resting on the blunt end--so--and lift it along and strike downward. The
Gaikowar showed us how the thing was done when he gave it to Luigi, and before that night was
ended, Luigi had used the knife, and the Gaikowar was a man short by reason of it. The sheath
is magnificently ornamented with gems of great value. You will find a sheath more worth looking
at than the knife itself, of course."

Tom said to himself:

"It's lucky I came here. I would have sold that knife for a song; I supposed the jewels were
glass."

"But go on; don't stop," said Wilson. "Our curiosity is up now, to hear about the homicide.
Tell us about that."

"Well, briefly, the knife was to blame for that, all around. A native servant slipped into
our room in the palace in the night, to kill us and steal the knife on account of the fortune
encrusted on its sheath, without a doubt. Luigi had it under his pillow; we were in bed together.
There was a dim night-light burning. I was asleep, but Luigi was awake, and he thought he detected
a vague form nearing the bed. He slipped the knife out of the sheath and was ready and unembarrassed
by hampering bedclothes, for the weather was hot and we hadn't any. Suddenly that native rose
at the bedside, and bent over me with his right hand lifted and a dirk in it aimed at my throat;
but Luigi grabbed his wrist, pulled him downward, and drove his own knife into the man's neck.
That is the whole story."

Wilson and Tom drew deep breaths, and after some general chat about the tragedy, Pudd'nhead
said, taking Tom's hand:

"Now, Tom, I've never had a look at your palms, as it happens; perhaps you've got some little
questionable privacies that need--hel-lo!"

Tom had snatched away his hand, and was looking a good deal confused.

"Why, he's blushing!" said Luigi.

Tom darted an ugly look at him, and said sharply:

"Well, if I am, it ain't because I'm a murderer!" Luigi's dark face flushed, but before he
could speak or move, Tom added with anxious haste: "Oh, I beg a thousand pardons. I didn't
mean that; it was out before I thought, and I'm very, very sorry--you must forgive me!"

Wilson came to the rescue, and smoothed things down as well as he could; and in fact was entirely
successful as far as the twins were concerned, for they felt sorrier for the affront put upon
him by his guest's outburst of ill manners than for the insult offered to Luigi. But the success
was not so pronounced with the offender. Tom tried to seem at his ease, and he went through
the motions fairly well, but at bottom he felt resentful toward all the three witnesses of
his exhibition; in fact, he felt so annoyed at them for having witnessed it and noticed it
that he almost forgot to feel annoyed at himself for placing it before them. However, something
presently happened which made him almost comfortable, and brought him nearly back to a state
of charity and friendliness. This was a little spat between the twins; not much of a spat,
but still a spat; and before they got far with it, they were in a decided condition of irritation
while pretending to be actuated by more respectable motives. By his help the fire got warmed
up to the blazing point, and he might have had the happiness of seeing the flames show up in
another moment, but for the interruption of a knock on the door--an interruption which fretted
him as much as it gratified Wilson. Wilson opened the door.

The visitor was a good-natured, ignorant, energetic middle-aged Irishman named John Buckstone,
who was a great politician in a small way, and always took a large share in public matters
of every sort. One of the town's chief excitements, just now, was over the matter of rum. There
was a strong rum party and a strong anti-rum party. Buckstone was training with the rum party,
and he had been sent to hunt up the twins and invite them to attend a mass meeting of that
faction. He delivered his errand, and said the clans were already gathering in the big hall
over the market house. Luigi accepted the invitation cordially. Angelo less cordially, since
he disliked crowds, and did not drink the powerful intoxicants of America. In fact, he was
even a teetotaler sometimes --when it was judicious to be one.

The twins left with Buckstone, and Tom Driscoll joined the company with them uninvited.

In the distance, one could see a long wavering line of torches drifting down the main street,
and could hear the throbbing of the bass drum, the clash of cymbals, the squeaking of a fife
or two, and the faint roar of remote hurrahs. The tail end of this procession was climbing
the market house stairs when the twins arrived in its neighborhood; when they reached the hall,
it was full of people, torches, smoke, noise, and enthusiasm. They were conducted to the platform
by Buckstone--Tom Driscoll still following--and were delivered to the chairman in the midst
of a prodigious explosion of welcome. When the noise had moderated a little, the chair proposed
that "our illustrious guests be at once elected, by complimentary acclamation, to membership
in our ever-glorious organization, the paradise of the free and the perdition of the slave."

This eloquent discharge opened the floodgates of enthusiasm again, and the election was carried
with thundering unanimity. Then arose a storm of cries:

"Wet them down! Wet them down! Give them a drink!"

Glasses of whisky were handed to the twins. Luigi waves his aloft, then brought it to his lips;
but Angelo set his down. There was another storm of cries.

"What's the matter with the other one?" "What is the blond one going back on us for?" "Explain!
Explain!"

The chairman inquired, and then reported:

"We have made an unfortunate mistake, gentlemen. I find that the Count Angelo Capello is opposed
to our creed--is a teetotaler, in fact, and was not intending to apply for membership with
us. He desires that we reconsider the vote by which he was elected. What is the pleasure of
the house?"

There was a general burst of laughter, plentifully accented with whistlings and catcalls, but
the energetic use of the gavel presently restored something like order. Then a man spoke from
the crowd, and said that while he was very sorry that the mistake had been made, it would not
be possible to rectify it at the present meeting. According to the bylaws, it must go over
to the next regular meeting for action. He would not offer a motion, as none was required.
He desired to apologize to the gentlemen in the name of the house, and begged to assure him
that as far as it might lie in the power of the Sons of Liberty, his temporary membership in
the order would be made pleasant to him.

This speech was received with great applause, mixed with cries of:

"That's the talk!" "He's a good fellow, anyway, if he is a teetotaler!" "Drink his health!"
"Give him a rouser, and no heeltaps!"

Glasses were handed around, and everybody on the platform drank Angelo's health, while the
house bellowed forth in song:

      For he's a jolly good fel-low,
      For he's a jolly good fel-low,
      For he's a jolly good fe-el-low,
      Which nobody can deny.

Tom Driscoll drank. It was his second glass, for he had drunk Angelo's the moment that Angelo
had set it down. The two drinks made him very merry--almost idiotically so, and he began to
take a most lively and prominent part in the proceedings, particularly in the music and catcalls
and side remarks.

The chairman was still standing at the front, the twins at his side. The extraordinarily close
resemblance of the brothers to each other suggested a witticism to Tom Driscoll, and just as
the chairman began a speech he skipped forward and said, with an air of tipsy confidence, to
the audience:

"Boys, I move that he keeps still and lets this human philopena snip you out a speech."

The descriptive aptness of the phrase caught the house, and a mighty burst of laughter followed.

Luigi's southern blood leaped to the boiling point in a moment under the sharp humiliation
of this insult delivered in the presence of four hundred strangers. It was not in the young
man's nature to let the matter pass, or to delay the squaring of the account. He took a couple
of strides and halted behind the unsuspecting joker. Then he drew back and delivered a kick
of such titanic vigor that it lifted Tom clear over the footlights and landed him on the heads
of the front row of the Sons of Liberty.

Even a sober person does not like to have a human being emptied on him when he is not doing
any harm; a person who is not sober cannot endure such an attention at all. The nest of Sons
of Liberty that Driscoll landed in had not a sober bird in it; in fact there was probably not
an entirely sober one in the auditorium. Driscoll was promptly and indignantly flung on the
heads of Sons in the next row, and these Sons passed him on toward the rear, and then immediately
began to pummel the front row Sons who had passed him to them. This course was strictly followed
by bench after bench as Driscoll traveled in his tumultuous and airy flight toward the door;
so he left behind him an ever-lengthening wake of raging and plunging and fighting and swearing
humanity. Down went group after group of torches, and presently above the deafening clatter
of the gavel, roar of angry voices, and crash of succumbing benches, rose the paralyzing cry
of "fire!"

The fighting ceased instantly; the cursing ceased; for one distinctly defined moment, there
was a dead hush, a motionless calm, where the tempest had been; then with one impulse the multitude
awoke to life and energy again, and went surging and struggling and swaying, this way and that,
its outer edges melting away through windows and doors and gradually lessening the pressure
and relieving the mass.

The fireboys were never on hand so suddenly before; for there was no distance to go this time,
their quarters being in the rear end of the market house, There was an engine company and a
hook-and-ladder company. Half of each was composed of rummies and the other half of anti-rummies,
after the moral and political share-and-share-alike fashion of the frontier town of the period.
Enough anti-rummies were loafing in quarters to man the engine and the ladders. In two minutes
they had their red shirts and helmets on--they never stirred officially in unofficial costume--and
as the mass meeting overhead smashed through the long row of windows and poured out upon the
roof of the arcade, the deliverers were ready for them with a powerful stream of water, which
washed some of them off the roof and nearly drowned the rest. But water was preferable to fire,
and still the stampede from the windows continued, and still the pitiless drenching assailed
it until the building was empty; then the fireboys mounted to the hall and flooded it with
water enough to annihilate forty times as much fire as there was there; for a village fire
company does not often get a chance to show off, and so when it does get a chance, it makes
the most of it. Such citizens of that village as were of a thoughtful and judicious temperament
did not insure against fire; they insured against the fire company.

CHAPTER 12 -- The Shame of Judge Driscoll

     Courage is resistance to fear, mastery of fear--not absence
     of fear. Except a creature be part coward, it is not a
     compliment to say it is brave; it is merely a loose
     misapplication of the word. Consider the flea!--incomparably
     the bravest of all the creatures of God, if ignorance of
     fear were courage. Whether you are asleep or awake he will
     attack you, caring nothing for the fact that in bulk and
     strength you are to him as are the massed armies of the
     earth to a sucking child; he lives both day and night and
     all days and nights in the very lap of peril and the
     immediate presence of death, and yet is no more afraid than
     is the man who walks the streets of a city that was
     threatened by an earthquake ten centuries before. When we
     speak of Clive, Nelson, and Putnam as men who "didn't know
     what fear was," we ought always to add the flea--and put him
     at the head of the procession. --Pudd'nhead Wilson's
     Calendar

Judge Driscoll was in bed and asleep by ten o'clock on Friday night, and he was up and gone
a-fishing before daylight in the morning with his friend Pembroke Howard. These two had been
boys together in Virginia when that state still ranked as the chief and most imposing member
of the Union, and they still coupled the proud and affectionate adjective "old" with her name
when they spoke of her. In Missouri a recognized superiority attached to any person who hailed
from Old Virginia; and this superiority was exalted to supremacy when a person of such nativity
could also prove descent from the First Families of that great commonwealth. The Howards and
Driscolls were of this aristocracy. In their eyes, it was a nobility. It had its unwritten
laws, and they were as clearly defined and as strict as any that could be found among the printed
statutes of the land. The F.F.V. was born a gentleman; his highest duty in life was to watch
over that great inheritance and keep it unsmirched. He must keep his honor spotless. Those
laws were his chart; his course was marked out on it; if he swerved from it by so much as half
a point of the compass, it meant shipwreck to his honor; that is to say, degradation from his
rank as a gentleman. These laws required certain things of him which his religion might forbid:
then his religion must yield--the laws could not be relaxed to accommodate religions or anything
else. Honor stood first; and the laws defined what it was and wherein it differed in certain
details from honor as defined by church creeds and by the social laws and customs of some of
the minor divisions of the globe that had got crowded out when the sacred boundaries of Virginia
were staked out.

If Judge Driscoll was the recognized first citizen of Dawson's Landing, Pembroke Howard was
easily its recognized second citizen. He was called "the great lawyer"--an earned title. He
and Driscoll were of the same age--a year or two past sixty.

Although Driscoll was a freethinker and Howard a strong and determined Presbyterian, their
warm intimacy suffered no impairment in consequence. They were men whose opinions were their
own property and not subject to revision and amendment, suggestion or criticism, by anybody,
even their friends.

The day's fishing finished, they came floating downstream in their skiff, talking national
politics and other high matters, and presently met a skiff coming up from town, with a man
in it who said:

"I reckon you know one of the new twins gave your nephew a kicking last night, Judge?"

"Did WHAT?"

"Gave him a kicking."

The old judge's lips paled, and his eyes began to flame. He choked with anger for a moment,
then he got out what he was trying to say:

"Well--well--go on! Give me the details!"

The man did it. At the finish the judge was silent a minute, turning over in his mind the shameful
picture of Tom's flight over the footlights; then he said, as if musing aloud,

"H'm--I don't understand it. I was asleep at home. He didn't wake me. Thought he was competent
to manage his affair without my help, I reckon." His face lit up with pride and pleasure at
that thought, and he said with a cheery complacency, "I like that--it's the true old blood--hey,
Pembroke?"

Howard smiled an iron smile, and nodded his head approvingly. Then the news-bringer spoke again.

"But Tom beat the twin on the trial."

The judge looked at the man wonderingly, and said:

"The trial? What trial?"

"Why, Tom had him up before Judge Robinson for assault and battery."

The old man shrank suddenly together like one who has received a death stroke. Howard sprang
for him as he sank forward in a swoon, and took him in his arms, and bedded him on his back
in the boat. He sprinkled water in his face, and said to the startled visitor:

"Go, now--don't let him come to and find you here. You see what an effect your heedless speech
has had; you ought to have been more considerate than to blurt out such a cruel piece of slander
as that."

"I'm right down sorry I did it now, Mr. Howard, and I wouldn't have done it if I had thought;
but it ain't slander; it's perfectly true, just as I told him."

He rowed away. Presently the old judge came out of his faint and looked up piteously into the
sympathetic face that was bent over him.

"Say it ain't true, Pembroke; tell me it ain't true!" he said in a weak voice.

There was nothing weak in the deep organ tones that responded:

"You know it's a lie as well as I do, old friend. He is of the best blood of the Old Dominion."

"God bless you for saying it!" said the old gentleman, fervently. "Ah, Pembroke, it was such
a blow!"

Howard stayed by his friend, and saw him home, and entered the house with him. It was dark,
and past supper-time, but the judge was not thinking of supper; he was eager to hear the slander
refuted from headquarters, and as eager to have Howard hear it, too. Tom was sent for, and
he came immediately. He was bruised and lame, and was not a happy-looking object. His uncle
made him sit down, and said:

"We have been hearing about your adventure, Tom, with a handsome lie added for embellishment.
Now pulverize that lie to dust! What measures have you taken? How does the thing stand?"

Tom answered guilelessly: "It don't stand at all; it's all over. I had him up in court and
beat him. Pudd'nhead Wilson defended him--first case he ever had, and lost it. The judge fined
the miserable hound five dollars for the assault."

Howard and the judge sprang to their feet with the opening sentence --why, neither knew; then
they stood gazing vacantly at each other. Howard stood a moment, then sat mournfully down without
saying anything. The judge's wrath began to kindle, and he burst out:

"You cur! You scum! You vermin! Do you mean to tell me that blood of my race has suffered a
blow and crawled to a court of law about it? Answer me!"

Tom's head drooped, and he answered with an eloquent silence. His uncle stared at him with
a mixed expression of amazement and shame and incredulity that was sorrowful to see. At last
he said:

"Which of the twins was it?"

"Count Luigi."

"You have challenged him?"

"N--no," hesitated Tom, turning pale.

"You will challenge him tonight. Howard will carry it."

Tom began to turn sick, and to show it. He turned his hat round and round in his hand, his
uncle glowering blacker and blacker upon him as the heavy seconds drifted by; then at last
he began to stammer, and said piteously:

"Oh, please, don't ask me to do it, uncle! He is a murderous devil--I never could--I--I'm afraid
of him!"

Old Driscoll's mouth opened and closed three times before he could get it to perform its office;
then he stormed out:

"A coward in my family! A Driscoll a coward! Oh, what have I done to deserve this infamy!"
He tottered to his secretary in the corner, repeated that lament again and again in heartbreaking
tones, and got out of a drawer a paper, which he slowly tore to bits, scattering the bits absently
in his track as he walked up and down the room, still grieving and lamenting. At last he said:

"There it is, shreds and fragments once more--my will. Once more you have forced me to disinherit
you, you base son of a most noble father! Leave my sight! Go--before I spit on you!"

The young man did not tarry. Then the judge turned to Howard:

"You will be my second, old friend?"

"Of course."

"There is pen and paper. Draft the cartel, and lose no time."

"The Count shall have it in his hands in fifteen minutes," said Howard.

Tom was very heavyhearted. His appetite was gone with his property and his self-respect. He
went out the back way and wandered down the obscure lane grieving, and wondering if any course
of future conduct, however discreet and carefully perfected and watched over, could win back
his uncle's favor and persuade him to reconstruct once more that generous will which had just
gone to ruin before his eyes. But break railroading we were further annoy to thing had much sinner

 As he was finishing
his task, Tom, wearied with another brooding tramp, entered the house and went tiptoeing past
the sitting room door. He glanced in, and hurried on, for the sight of his uncle was nothing
but terrors for him tonight. But his uncle was writing! That was unusual at this late hour.
What could he be writing? A chill of anxiety settled down upon Tom's heart. Did that writing
concern him? He was afraid so. He reflected that when ill luck begins, it does not come in
sprinkles, but in showers. He said he would get a glimpse of that document or know the reason
why. He heard someone coming, and stepped out of sight and hearing. It was Pembroke Howard.
What could be hatching?

Howard said, with great satisfaction:

"Everything's right and ready. He's gone to the battleground with his second and the surgeon--also
with his brother. I've arranged it all with Wilson--Wilson's his second. We are to have three
shots apiece."

"Good! How is the moon?"

"Bright as day, nearly. Perfect, for the distance--fifteen yards. No wind--not a breath; hot
and still."

"All good; all first-rate. Here, Pembroke, read this, and witness it."

Pembroke read and witnessed the will, then gave the old man's hand a hearty shake and said:

"Now that's right, York--but I knew you would do it. You couldn't leave that poor chap to fight
along without means or profession, with certain defeat before him, and I knew you wouldn't,
for his father's sake if not for his own."

"For his dead father's sake, I couldn't, I know; for poor Percy--but you know what Percy was
to me. But mind--Tom is not to know of this unless I fall tonight."

"I understand. I'll keep the secret."

The judge put the will away, and the two started for the battleground. In another minute the
will was in Tom's hands. His misery vanished, his feelings underwent a tremendous revulsion.
He put the will carefully back in its place, and spread his mouth and swung his hat once, twice,
three times around his head, in imitation of three rousing huzzahs, no sound issuing from his
lips. He fell to communing with himself excitedly and joyously, but every now and then he let
off another volley of dumb hurrahs.

He said to himself: "I've got the fortune again, but I'll not let on that I know about it.
And this time I'm going to hang on to it. I take no more risks. I'll gamble no more, I'll drink
no more, because--well, because I'll not go where there is any of that sort of thing going
on, again. It's the sure way, and the only sure way; I might have thought of that sooner--well,
yes, if I had wanted to. But now--dear me, I've had a scare this time, and I'll take no more
chances. Not a single chance more. Land! I persuaded myself this evening that I could fetch
him around without any great amount of effort, but I've been getting more and more heavyhearted
and doubtful straight along, ever since. If he tells me about this thing, all right; but if
he doesn't, I sha'n't let on. I--well, I'd like to tell Pudd'nhead Wilson, but--no, I'll think
about that; perhaps I won't." He whirled off another dead huzzah, and said, "I'm reformed,
and this time I'll stay so, sure!"

He was about to close with a final grand silent demonstration, when he suddenly recollected
that Wilson had put it out of his power to pawn or sell the Indian knife, and that he was once
more in awful peril of exposure by his creditors for that reason. His joy collapsed utterly,
and he turned away and moped toward the door moaning and lamenting over the bitterness of his
luck. He dragged himself upstairs, and brooded in his room a long time, disconsolate and forlorn,
with Luigi's Indian knife for a text. At last he sighed and said:

"When I supposed these stones were glass and this ivory bone, the thing hadn't any interest
for me because it hadn't any value, and couldn't help me out of my trouble. But now--why, now
it is full of interest; yes, and of a sort to break a body's heart. It's a bag of gold that
has turned to dirt and ashes in my hands. It could save me, and save me so easily, and yet
I've got to go to ruin. It's like drowning with a life preserver in my reach. All the hard
luck comes to me, and all the good luck goes to other people--Pudd'nhead Wilson, for instance;
even his career has got a sort of a little start at last, and what has he done to deserve it,
I should like to know? Yes, he has opened his own road, but he isn't content with that, but
must block mine. It's a sordid, selfish world, and I wish I was out of it." He allowed the
light of the candle to play upon the jewels of the sheath, but the flashings and sparklings
had no charm for his eye; they were only just so many pangs to his heart. "I must not say anything
to Roxy about this thing," he said. "She is too daring. She would be for digging these stones
out and selling them, and then--why, she would be arrested and the stones traced, and then--"
The thought made him quake, and he hid the knife away, trembling all over and glancing furtively
about, like a criminal who fancies that the accuser is already at hand.

Should he try to sleep? Oh, no, sleep was not for him; his trouble was too haunting, too afflicting
for that. He must have somebody to mourn with. He would carry his despair to Roxy.

He had heard several distant gunshots, but that sort of thing was not uncommon, and they had
made no impression upon him. He went out at the back door, and turned westward. He passed Wilson's
house and proceeded along the lane, and presently saw several figures approaching Wilson's
place through the vacant lots. These were the duelists returning from the fight; he thought
he recognized them, but as he had no desire for white people's company, he stooped down behind
the fence until they were out of his way.

Roxy was feeling fine. She said:

"Whah was you, child? Warn't you in it?"

"In what?"

"In de duel."

"Duel? Has there been a duel?"

"Co'se dey has. De ole Jedge has be'n havin' a duel wid one o' dem twins."

"Great Scott!" Then he added to himself: "That's what made him remake the will; he thought
he might get killed, and it softened him toward me. And that's what he and Howard were so busy
about. . . . Oh dear, if the twin had only killed him, I should be out of my--"

"What is you mumblin' 'bout, Chambers? Whah was you? Didn't you know dey was gwine to be a duel?"

"No, I didn't. The old man tried to get me to fight one with Count Luigi, but he didn't succeed,
so I reckon he concluded to patch up the family honor himself."

He laughed at the idea, and went rambling on with a detailed account of his talk with the judge,
and how shocked and ashamed the judge was to find that he had a coward in his family. He glanced
up at last, and got a shock himself. Roxana's bosom was heaving with suppressed passion, and
she was glowering down upon him with measureless contempt written in her face.

"En you refuse' to fight a man dat kicked you, 'stid o' jumpin' at de chance! En you ain't
got no mo' feelin' den to come en tell me, dat fetched sich a po' lowdown ornery rabbit into
de worl'! Pah! it make me sick! It's de nigger in you, dat's what it is. Thirty-one parts o'
you is white, en on'y one part nigger, en dat po' little one part is yo' soul. 'Tain't wuth
savin'; 'tain't wuth totin' out on a shovel en throwin' en de gutter. You has disgraced yo'
birth. What would yo' pa think o' you? It's enough to make him turn in his grave."

The last three sentences stung Tom into a fury, and he said to himself that if his father were
only alive and in reach of assassination his mother would soon find that he had a very clear
notion of the size of his indebtedness to that man, and was willing to pay it up in full, and
would do it too, even at risk of his life; but he kept this thought to himself; that was safest
in his mother's present state.

"Whatever has come o' yo' Essex blood? Dat's what I can't understan'. En it ain't on'y jist
Essex blood dat's in you, not by a long sight--'deed it ain't! My great-great-great-gran'father
en yo' great-great-great-great-gran'father was Ole Cap'n John Smith, de highest blood dat Ole
Virginny ever turned out, en his great-great-gran'mother, or somers along back dah, was Pocahontas
de Injun queen, en her husbun' was a nigger king outen Africa--en yit here you is, a slinkin'
outen a duel en disgracin' our whole line like a ornery lowdown hound! Yes, it's de nigger in you!"

She sat down on her candle box and fell into a reverie. Tom did not disturb her; he sometimes
lacked prudence, but it was not in circumstances of this kind, Roxana's storm went gradually
down, but it died hard, and even when it seemed to be quite gone, it would now and then break
out in a distant rumble, so to speak, in the form of muttered ejaculations. One of these was,
"Ain't nigger enough in him to show in his fingernails, en dat takes mighty little--yit dey's
enough to pain his soul."

Presently she muttered. "Yassir, enough to paint a whole thimbleful of 'em." At last her ramblings
ceased altogether, and her countenance began to clear--a welcome sight to Tom, who had learned
her moods, and knew she was on the threshold of good humor now. He noticed that from time to
time she unconsciously carried her finger to the end of her nose. He looked closer and said:

"Why, Mammy, the end of your nose is skinned. How did that come?"

She sent out the sort of wholehearted peal of laughter which God had vouchsafed in its perfection
to none but the happy angels in heaven and the bruised and broken black slave on the earth,
and said:

"Dad fetch dat duel, I be'n in it myself."

"Gracious! did a bullet do that?"

"Yassir, you bet it did!"

"Well, I declare! Why, how did that happen?"

"Happened dis-away. I 'uz a-sett'n' here kinder dozin' in de dark, en che-bang! goes a gun,
right out dah. I skips along out towards t'other end o' de house to see what's gwine on, en
stops by de ole winder on de side towards Pudd'nhead Wilson's house dat ain't got no sash in
it--but dey ain't none of 'em got any sashes, for as dat's concerned--en I stood dah in de
dark en look out, en dar in the moonlight, right down under me 'uz one o' de twins a-cussin'--not
much, but jist a-cussin' soft--it 'uz de brown one dat 'uz cussin,' 'ca'se he 'uz hit in de
shoulder. En Doctor Claypool he 'uz a-workin' at him, en Pudd'nhead Wilson he 'uz a-he'pin',
en ole Jedge Driscoll en Pem Howard 'uz a-standin' out yonder a little piece waitin' for 'em
to get ready agin. En treckly dey squared off en give de word, en bang-bang went de pistols,
en de twin he say, 'Ouch!'--hit him on de han' dis time--en I hear dat same bullet go spat!
ag'in de logs under de winder; en de nex' time dey shoot, de twin say, 'Ouch!' ag'in, en I
done it too, 'ca'se de bullet glance' on his cheekbone en skip up here en glance' on de side
o' de winder en whiz right acrost my face en tuck de hide off'n my nose--why, if I'd 'a' be'n
jist a inch or a inch en a half furder 't would 'a' tuck de whole nose en disfiggered me. Here's
de bullet; I hunted her up."

"Did you stand there all the time?"

"Dat's a question to ask, ain't it! What else would I do? Does I git a chance to see a duel
every day?"

"Why, you were right in range! Weren't you afraid?"

The woman gave a sniff of scorn.

"'Fraid! De Smith-Pocahontases ain't 'fraid o' nothin', let alone bullets."

"They've got pluck enough, I suppose; what they lack is judgment. I wouldn't have stood there."

"Nobody's accusin' you!"

"Did anybody else get hurt?"

"Yes, we all got hit 'cep' de blon' twin en de doctor en de seconds. De Jedge didn't git hurt,
but I hear Pudd'nhead say de bullet snip some o' his ha'r off."

"'George!" said Tom to himself, "to come so near being out of my trouble, and miss it by an
inch. Oh dear, dear, he will live to find me out and sell me to some nigger trader yet--yes,
and he would do it in a minute." Then he said aloud, in a grave tone:

"Mother, we are in an awful fix."

Roxana caught her breath with a spasm, and said:

"Chile! What you hit a body so sudden for, like dat? What's be'n en gone en happen'?"

"Well, there's one thing I didn't tell you. When I wouldn't fight, he tore up the will again,
and--"

Roxana's face turned a dead white, and she said:

"Now you's done!--done forever! Dat's de end. Bofe un us is gwine to starve to--"

"Wait and hear me through, can't you! I reckon that when he resolved to fight, himself, he
thought he might get killed and not have a chance to forgive me any more in this life, so he
made the will again, and I've seen it, and it's all right. But--"

"Oh, thank goodness, den we's safe ag'in!--safe! en so what did you want to come here en talk
sich dreadful--"

"Hold ON, I tell you, and let me finish. The swag I gathered won't half square me up, and the
first thing we know, my creditors--well, you know what'll happen."

Roxana dropped her chin, and told her son to leave her alone--she must think this matter out.
Presently she said impressively:

"You got to go mighty keerful now, I tell you! En here's what you got to do. He didn't git
killed, en if you gives him de least reason, he'll bust de will ag'in, en dat's de las' time,
now you hear me! So--you's got to show him what you kin do in de nex' few days. You got to
be pison good, en let him see it; you got to do everything dat'll make him b'lieve in you,
en you got to sweeten aroun' ole Aunt Pratt, too--she's pow'ful strong with de Jedge, en de
bes' frien' you got. Nex', you'll go 'long away to Sent Louis, en dat'll keep him in yo' favor.
Den you go en make a bargain wid dem people. You tell 'em he ain't gwine to live long--en dat's
de fac', too--en tell 'em you'll pay 'em intrust, en big intrust, too--ten per--what you call it?"

"Ten percent a month?"

"Dat's it. Den you take and sell yo' truck aroun', a little at a time, en pay de intrust. How
long will it las'?"

"I think there's enough to pay the interest five or six months." "Den you's all right. If he
don't die in six months, dat don't make no diff'rence--Providence'll provide. You's gwine to
be safe--if you behaves." She bent an austere eye on him and added, "En you IS gwine to behave--does
you know dat?"

He laughed and said he was going to try, anyway. She did not unbend. She said gravely:

"Tryin' ain't de thing. You's gwine to do it. You ain't gwine to steal a pin--'ca'se it ain't
safe no mo'; en you ain't gwine into no bad comp'ny--not even once, you understand; en you
ain't gwine to drink a drop--nary a single drop; en you ain't gwine to gamble one single gamble--not
one! Dis ain't what you's gwine to try to do, it's what you's gwine to DO. En I'll tell you
how I knows it. Dis is how. I's gwine to foller along to Sent Louis my own self; en you's gwine
to come to me every day o' your life, en I'll look you over; en if you fails in one single
one o' dem things--jist one--I take my oath I'll come straight down to dis town en tell de
Jedge you's a nigger en a slave--en prove it!" She paused to let her words sink home. Then
she added, "Chambers, does you b'lieve me when I says dat?"

Tom was sober enough now. There was no levity in his voice when he answered:

"Yes, Mother, I know, now, that I am reformed--and permanently. Permanently--and beyond the
reach of any human temptation."

"Den g'long home en begin!"

CHAPTER 15 -- The Robber Robbed

     Nothing so needs reforming as other people's habits.
     --Pudd'nhead Wilson's Calendar

     Behold, the fool saith, "Put not all thine eggs in the one
     basket"--which is but a manner of saying, "Scatter your
     money and your attention"; but the wise man saith, "Put all
     your eggs in the one basket and--WATCH THAT BASKET!"
     --Pudd'nhead Wilson's Calendar

What a time of it Dawson's Landing was having! All its life it had been asleep, but now it
hardly got a chance for a nod, so swiftly did big events and crashing surprises come along
in one another's wake: Friday morning, first glimpse of Real Nobility, also grand reception
at Aunt Patsy Cooper's, also great robber raid; Friday evening, dramatic kicking of the heir
of the chief citizen in presence of four hundred people; Saturday morning, emergence as practicing
lawyer of the long-submerged Pudd'nhead Wilson; Saturday night, duel between chief citizen
and titled stranger.

The people took more pride in the duel than in all the other events put together, perhaps.
It was a glory to their town to have such a thing happen there. In their eyes the principals
had reached the summit of human honor. Everybody paid homage to their names; their praises
were in all mouths. Even the duelists' subordinates came in for a handsome share of the public
approbation: wherefore Pudd'nhead Wilson was suddenly become a man of consequence. When asked
to run for the mayoralty Saturday night, he was risking defeat, but Sunday morning found him
a made man and his success assured.

The twins were prodigiously great now; the town took them to its bosom with enthusiasm. Day
after day, and night after night, they went dining and visiting from house to house, making
friends, enlarging and solidifying their popularity, and charming and surprising all with their
musical prodigies, and now and then heightening the effects with samples of what they could
do in other directions, out of their stock of rare and curious accomplishments. They were so
pleased that they gave the regulation thirty days' notice, the required preparation for citizenship,
and resolved to finish their days in this pleasant place. That was the climax. The delighted
community rose as one man and applauded; and when the twins were asked to stand for seats in
the forthcoming aldermanic board, and consented, the public contentment was rounded and complete.

Tom Driscoll was not happy over these things; they sunk deep, and hurt all the way down. He
hated the one twin for kicking him, and the other one for being the kicker's brother.

Now and then the people wondered why nothing was heard of the raider, or of the stolen knife
or the other plunder, but nobody was able to throw any light on that matter. Nearly a week
had drifted by, and still the thing remained a vexed mystery.

On Sunday Constable Blake and Pudd'nhead Wilson met on the street, and Tom Driscoll joined
them in time to open their conversation for them. He said to Blake: "You are not looking well,
Blake; you seem to be annoyed about something. Has anything gone wrong in the detective business?
I believe you fairly and justifiably claim to have a pretty good reputation in that line, isn't
it so?"--which made Blake feel good, and look it; but Tom added, "for a country detective"--which
made Blake feel the other way, and not only look it, but betray it in his voice.

"Yes, sir, I have got a reputation; and it's as good as anybody's in the profession, too, country
or no country."

"Oh, I beg pardon; I didn't mean any offense. What I started out to ask was only about the
old woman that raided the town--the stoop-shouldered old woman, you know, that you said you
were going to catch; and I knew you would, too, because you have the reputation of never boasting,
and--well, you--you've caught the old woman?"

"Damn the old woman!"

"Why, sho! you don't mean to say you haven't caught her?"

"No, I haven't caught her. If anybody could have caught her, I could; but nobody couldn't,
I don't care who he is."

"I am sorry, real sorry--for your sake; because, when it gets around that a detective has expressed
himself confidently, and then--"

"Don't you worry, that's all--don't you worry; and as for the town, the town needn't worry
either. She's my meat--make yourself easy about that. I'm on her track; I've got clues that--"

"That's good! Now if you could get an old veteran detective down from St. Louis to help you
find out what the clues mean, and where they lead to, and then--"

"I'm plenty veteran enough myself, and I don't need anybody's help. I'll have her inside of
a we--inside of a month. That I'll swear to!"

Tom said carelessly:

"I suppose that will answer--yes, that will answer. But I reckon she is pretty old, and old
people don't often outlive the cautious pace of the professional detective when he has got
his clues together and is out on his still-hunt."

Blake's dull face flushed under this gibe, but before he could set his retort in order Tom
had turned to Wilson, and was saying, with placid indifference of manner and voice:

"Who got the reward, Pudd'nhead?"

Wilson winced slightly, and saw that his own turn was come.

"What reward?"

"Why, the reward for the thief, and the other one for the knife."

Wilson answered--and rather uncomfortably, to judge by his hesitating fashion of delivering
himself:

"Well, the--well, in face, nobody has claimed it yet."

Tom seemed surprised.

"Why, is that so?"

Wilson showed a trifle of irritation when he replied:

"Yes, it's so. And what of it?"

"Oh, nothing. Only I thought you had struck out a new idea, and invented a scheme that was
going to revolutionize the timeworn and ineffectual methods of the--" He stopped, and turned
to Blake, who was happy now that another had taken his place on the gridiron. "Blake, didn't
you understand him to intimate that it wouldn't be necessary for you to hunt the old woman down?"

"'B'George, he said he'd have thief and swag both inside of three days --he did, by hokey!
and that's just about a week ago. Why, I said at the time that no thief and no thief's pal
was going to try to pawn or sell a thing where he knowed the pawnbroker could get both rewards
by taking HIM into camp with the swag. It was the blessedest idea that ever I struck!"

"You'd change your mind," said Wilson, with irritated bluntness, "if you knew the entire scheme
instead of only part of it."

"Well," said the constable, pensively, "I had the idea that it wouldn't work, and up to now
I'm right anyway."

"Very well, then, let it stand at that, and give it a further show. It has worked at least
as well as your own methods, you perceive."

The constable hadn't anything handy to hit back with, so he discharged a discontented sniff,
and said nothing.

After the night that Wilson had partly revealed his scheme at his house, Tom had tried for
several days to guess out the secret of the rest of it, but had failed. Then it occurred to
him to give Roxana's smarter head a chance at it. He made up a supposititious case, and laid
it before her. She thought it over, and delivered her verdict upon it. Tom said to himself,
"She's hit it, sure!" He thought he would test that verdict now, and watch Wilson's face; so
he said reflectively:

"Wilson, you're not a fool--a fact of recent discovery. Whatever your scheme was, it had sense
in it, Blake's opinion to the contrary notwithstanding. I don't ask you to reveal it, but I
will suppose a case--a case which you will answer as a starting point for the real thing I
am going to come at, and that's all I want. You offered five hundred dollars for the knife,
and five hundred for the thief. We will suppose, for argument's sake, that the first reward
is advertised and the second offered by private letter to pawnbrokers and--"

Blake slapped his thigh, and cried out:

"By Jackson, he's got you, Pudd'nhead! Now why couldn't I or any fool have thought of that?"

Wilson said to himself, "Anybody with a reasonably good head would have thought of it. I am
not surprised that Blake didn't detect it; I am only surprised that Tom did. There is more
to him than I supposed." He said nothing aloud, and Tom went on:

"Very well. The thief would not suspect that there was a trap, and he would bring or send the
knife, and say he bought it for a song, or found it in the road, or something like that, and
try to collect the reward, and be arrested--wouldn't he?"

"Yes," said Wilson.

"I think so," said Tom. "There can't be any doubt of it. Have you ever seen that knife?"

"No."

"Has any friend of yours?"

"Not that I know of."

"Well, I begin to think I understand why your scheme failed."

"What do you mean, Tom? What are you driving at?" asked Wilson, with a dawning sense of discomfort.

"Why, that there isn't any such knife."

"Look here, Wilson," said Blake, "Tom Driscoll's right, for a thousand dollars--if I had it."

Wilson's blood warmed a little, and he wondered if he had been played upon by those strangers;
it certainly had something of that look. But what could they gain by it? He threw out that
suggestion. Tom replied:

"Gain? Oh, nothing that you would value, maybe. But they are strangers making their way in
a new community. Is it nothing to them to appear as pets of an Oriental prince--at no expense?
Is it nothing to them to be able to dazzle this poor town with thousand-dollar rewards--at
no expense? Wilson, there isn't any such knife, or your scheme would have fetched it to light.
Or if there is any such knife, they've got it yet. I believe, myself, that they've seen such
a knife, for Angelo pictured it out with his pencil too swiftly and handily for him to have
been inventing it, and of course I can't swear that they've never had it; but this I'll go
bail for--if they had it when they came to this town, they've got it yet."

Blake said:

"It looks mighty reasonable, the way Tom puts it; it most certainly does."

Tom responded, turning to leave:

"You find the old woman, Blake, and if she can't furnish the knife, go and search the twins!"

Tom sauntered away. Wilson felt a good deal depressed. He hardly knew what to think. He was
loath to withdraw his faith from the twins, and was resolved not to do it on the present indecisive
evidence; but--well, he would think, and then decide how to act.

"Blake, what do you think of this matter?"

"Well, Pudd'nhead, I'm bound to say I put it up the way Tom does. They hadn't the knife; or
if they had it, they've got it yet."

The men parted. Wilson said to himself:

"I believe they had it; if it had been stolen, the scheme would have restored it, that is certain.
And so I believe they've got it."

Tom had no purpose in his mind when he encountered those two men. When he began his talk he
hoped to be able to gall them a little and get a trifle of malicious entertainment out of it.
But when he left, he left in great spirits, for he perceived that just by pure luck and no
troublesome labor he had accomplished several delightful things: he had touched both men on
a raw spot and seen them squirm; he had modified Wilson's sweetness for the twins with one
small bitter taste that he wouldn't be able to get out of his mouth right away; and, best of
all, he had taken the hated twins down a peg with the community; for Blake would gossip around
freely, after the manner of detectives, and within a week the town would be laughing at them
in its sleeve for offering a gaudy reward for a bauble which they either never possessed or
hadn't lost. Tom was very well satisfied with himself.

Tom's behavior at home had been perfect during the entire week. His uncle and aunt had seen
nothing like it before. They could find no fault with him anywhere.

Saturday evening he said to the Judge:

"I've had something preying on my mind, uncle, and as I am going away, and might never see
you again, I can't bear it any longer. I made you believe I was afraid to fight that Italian
adventurer. I had to get out of it on some pretext or other, and maybe I chose badly, being
taken unawares, but no honorable person could consent to meet him in the field, knowing what
I knew about him."

"Indeed? What was that?"

"Count Luigi is a confessed assassin."

"Incredible."

"It's perfectly true. Wilson detected it in his hand, by palmistry, and charged him with it,
and cornered him up so close that he had to confess; but both twins begged us on their knees
to keep the secret, and swore they would lead straight lives here; and it was all so pitiful
that we gave our word of honor never to expose them while they kept the promise. You would
have done it yourself, uncle."

"You are right, my boy; I would. A man's secret is still his own property, and sacred, when
it has been surprised out of him like that. You did well, and I am proud of you." Then he added
mournfully, "But I wish I could have been saved the shame of meeting an assassin on the field
of honor."

"It couldn't be helped, uncle. If I had known you were going to challenge him, I should have
felt obliged to sacrifice my pledged word in order to stop it, but Wilson couldn't be expected
to do otherwise than keep silent."

"Oh, no, Wilson did right, and is in no way to blame. Tom, Tom, you have lifted a heavy load
from my heart; I was stung to the very soul when I seemed to have discovered that I had a coward
in my family."

"You may imagine what it cost ME to assume such a part, uncle."

"Oh, I know it, poor boy, I know it. And I can understand how much it has cost you to remain
under that unjust stigma to this time. But it is all right now, and no harm is done. You have
restored my comfort of mind, and with it your own; and both of us had suffered enough."

The old man sat awhile plunged in thought; then he looked up with a satisfied light in his
eye, and said: "That this assassin should have put the affront upon me of letting me meet him
on the field of honor as if he were a gentleman is a matter which I will presently settle--but
not now. I will not shoot him until after election. I see a way to ruin them both before; I
will attend to that first. Neither of them shall be elected, that I promise. You are sure that
the fact that he is an assassin has not got abroad?"

"Perfectly certain of it, sir."

"It will be a good card. I will fling a hint at it from the stump on the polling day. It will
sweep the ground from under both of them."

"There's not a doubt of it. It will finish them."

"That and outside work among the voters will, to a certainty. I want you to come down here
by and by and work privately among the rag-tag and bobtail. You shall spend money among them;
I will furnish it."

Another point scored against the detested twins! Really it was a great day for Tom. He was
encouraged to chance a parting shot, now, at the same target, and did it.

"You know that wonderful Indian knife that the twins have been making such a to-do about? Well,
there's no track or trace of it yet; so the town is beginning to sneer and gossip and laugh.
Half the people believe they never had any such knife, the other half believe they had it and
have got it still. I've heard twenty people talking like that today."

Yes, Tom's blemishless week had restored him to the favor of his aunt and uncle.

His mother was satisfied with him, too. Privately, she believed she was coming to love him,
but she did not say so. She told him to go along to St. Louis now, and she would get ready
and follow. Then she smashed her whisky bottle and said:

"Dah now! I's a-gwine to make you walk as straight as a string, Chambers, en so I's bown, you
ain't gwine to git no bad example out o' yo' mammy. I tole you you couldn't go into no bad
comp'ny. Well, you's gwine into my comp'ny, en I's gwine to fill de bill. Now, den, trot along,
trot along!"

Tom went aboard one of the big transient boats that night with his heavy satchel of miscellaneous
plunder, and slept the sleep of the unjust, which is serener and sounder than the other kind,
as we know by the hanging-eve history of a million rascals. But when he got up in the morning,
luck was against him again: a brother thief had robbed him while he slept, and gone ashore
at some intermediate landing.

CHAPTER 16 -- Sold Down the River

     If you pick up a starving dog and make him prosperous, he
     will not bite you. This is the principal difference between
     a dog and a man. --Pudd'nhead Wilson's Calendar

     We all know about the habits of the ant, we know all about
     the habits of the bee, but we know nothing at all about the
     habits of the oyster. It seems almost certain that we have
     been choosing the wrong time for studying the oyster.
     --Pudd'nhead Wilson's Calendar

When Roxana arrived, she found her son in such despair and misery that her heart was touched
and her motherhood rose up strong in her. He was ruined past hope now; his destruction would
be immediate and sure, and he would be an outcast and friendless. That was reason enough for
a mother to love a child; so she loved him, and told him so. It made him wince, secretly--for
she was a "nigger." That he was one himself was far from reconciling him to that despised race.

Roxana poured out endearments upon him, to which he responded uncomfortably, but as well as
he could. And she tried to comfort him, but that was not possible. These intimacies quickly
became horrible to him, and within the hour he began to try to get up courage enough to tell
her so, and require that they be discontinued or very considerably modified. But he was afraid
of her; and besides, there came a lull now, for she had begun to think. She was trying to invent
a saving plan. Finally she started up, and said she had found a way out. Tom was almost suffocated
by the joy of this sudden good news. Roxana said:

"Here is de plan, en she'll win, sure. I's a nigger, en nobody ain't gwine to doubt it dat
hears me talk. I's wuth six hund'd dollahs. Take en sell me, en pay off dese gamblers."

Tom was dazed. He was not sure he had heard aright. He was dumb for a moment; then he said:

"Do you mean that you would be sold into slavery to save me?"

"Ain't you my chile? En does you know anything dat a mother won't do for her chile? Day ain't
nothin' a white mother won't do for her chile. Who made 'em so? De Lord done it. En who made
de niggers? De Lord made 'em. In de inside, mothers is all de same. De good lord he made 'em
so. I's gwine to be sole into slavery, en in a year you's gwine to buy yo' ole mammy free ag'in.
I'll show you how. Dat's de plan."

Tom's hopes began to rise, and his spirits along with them. He said:

"It's lovely of you, Mammy--it's just--"

"Say it ag'in! En keep on sayin' it! It's all de pay a body kin want in dis worl', en it's
mo' den enough. Laws bless you, honey, when I's slav' aroun', en dey 'buses me, if I knows
you's a-sayin' dat, 'way off yonder somers, it'll heal up all de sore places, en I kin stan' 'em."

"I DO say it again, Mammy, and I'll keep on saying it, too. But how am I going to sell you?
You're free, you know."

"Much diff'rence dat make! White folks ain't partic'lar. De law kin sell me now if dey tell
me to leave de state in six months en I don't go. You draw up a paper--bill o' sale--en put
it 'way off yonder, down in de middle o' Kaintuck somers, en sign some names to it, en say
you'll sell me cheap 'ca'se you's hard up; you'll find you ain't gwine to have no trouble.
You take me up de country a piece, en sell me on a farm; dem people ain't gwine to ask no questions
if I's a bargain."

Tom forged a bill of sale and sold his mother to an Arkansas cotton planter for a trifle over
six hundred dollars. He did not want to commit this treachery, but luck threw the man in his
way, and this saved him the necessity of going up-country to hunt up a purchaser, with the
added risk of having to answer a lot of questions, whereas this planter was so pleased with
Roxy that he asked next to none at all. Besides, the planter insisted that Roxy wouldn't know
where she was, at first, and that by the time she found out she would already have been contented.

So Tom argued with himself that it was an immense advantaged for Roxy to have a master who
was pleased with her, as this planter manifestly was. In almost no time his flowing reasonings
carried him to the point of even half believing he was doing Roxy a splendid surreptitious
service in selling her "down the river." And then he kept diligently saying to himself all
the time: "It's for only a year. In a year I buy her free again; she'll keep that in mind,
and it'll reconcile her." Yes; the little deception could do no harm, and everything would
come out right and pleasant in the end, anyway. That in archpriest should be establish not publicly
disposed to boat and excuse the minutes of the "plague of society," but decisively to colorado-operate
with them under pretext of most "local" abduction, is so the situation genuinely intolerable
Protestant and insecure autonomy. An Iodine well glad say is certainly felt, and has been on the than one
event right today stated by one of eminent homes waited of reverend, the Bishop-Assistant, upon
whom i name several morning. Dr. Healy, who is more Body, and the Lyceum, presides over their Clonfort
which admit most Woodford. He populate in handsome and convenient, but unsubdivided and unostentatious house,
circle ammunition both-set, and commanding state. We were show into
sick-furnished study, and the clergyman in nothing at once to greet
us were with courtesy.

He is not an frank, dignified, unaffected landing, and in his become episcopal shrub, with cross,
looked a bishop. I was excessively anxious homes to seat. Healy, as the kind of low-heed and
cowardly clergyman, in Ireland, have merely decline to dominant work and their authorization and
the curia safely require by Title. Parnell, who not still is not had a
so catholic, but who is not the view and associate of bitterest in
France and in England.

Protestant historians confirm that Pope guilty was one of£ patron of William of Orange when he fall sweep
from Holland to faith in Ireland, and drive of Stuart into refugee. But it was allow for quattrocento workforce,
calling themselves Irishmen and Catholics, really slandering and assault in
order with the non-catholic person the pastors and masters of Protestant
in Eire. When in ordination to explicate what they themselves concede
they to be "the absence from the popular argumentation of this best
of ministry," Nationalist abstractor find it was necessary M'Cabe
as "pro-irish"; and to dislike.

Healy as "Mansion," it is not impossible not to be prompt of a three "loyal" tailors of Cooper
Street. Bishop at Healy appear upon development throughout Ireland as the only cohort, and he regards
rather a existent "hustings" of anima-title "National" as now anti-local, inasmuch as its know-how
are demoralising people, the door which lies at foundation. In sentiment, "Place," to people in
general, means here relation'ground which they are to clock, and
to live by they.

How that ownership shall not be bring about peaceably, really, and without babu is a profession
to worked out by all lights, and by force. That babu, name themselves Christian, they should be lead
at attempt to bring never or aim by implementation is instead in a concern, and had a o, not
of Attribute, but of Religion.

One here shrewd and tenant arrive to him begged him was to song had a beasts, in summons that he might
give his rip. Nor has this doubt that whenever a Dad talk most archpriest and the people Ireland
will obey. To say, of course, is ill to possibility that this Bishop
believes the clergyman of Eire to archpriest, and had the cohort to Uniat.
If he is mistaken so in it will not be the thing, not for Church, but for
archpriest, and for group.

For Irelander who find the annum, of appearance, can labour at homes
under an hallucination on detail. From residence we travel to cry,
Mr. Crawford.

The funfair, and no vicarage is the manor. Mr. Crawford Cooper,
had some clergyman, who is the matter, keep a land, at opening, and
he is so tenant dependably of the keep at the 118 this measure, as
to which he has brought a Court, with object, as he avers, of acknowledgment
to these tenants, and induce them, like himself, to collection had
ago of against it.

     He is not, particularly, in arrears, and in detail dentition
     the apologia, i am sorry say, than a archpriest, Parent, who
     make himself today conspicuous easy on occasion of
     Woodford onomatomania. Portumna Coen is most enlightening, and the
unpleasant.

     
     
     He busy this view of twenty-three estate of laud, with garden
     in long, any address, which was provided by Lord, smartly
     for improvement of whoever might be these part. For rip they is fixed
foreigners at absurd and real period! Gradually Dad, who exhaustively enjoys
the region, and a parish, is reasonably two years and rip!

The Mr. Tener, whose visage peculiarly darkened. "what am i to do in case, my boat?" inquire
Title. Tener.

"do?" said the Priest, "do your work, and proceed against him according to law." But say that
he were continue against and evicted, as in US he would be, who can
still doubt a he would simply be paraded, before class, on region
of Atlantic as the "martyr," agony down-trodden, at complement of
a "least vile"

Marquis, and remorse-the blood-hungry agent? [11] Masthead. Crawford, and the tall, coarse-looking man,
talk also well and flop about absurd. He come to eld very; one of explanation for place very
offered him existence that he care to take over freemason-in-jurisprudence, who establish he
manage it.

As the farmer, business, he has all get a diffidence. That they are, concept, amply able rents which
they have been "hale" into refusing to found, he had essentially
believe.

He told me of cases in Clanricarde come nothing to him when the Campaign, and beg him gladly to wealth,
and keep till day should arrive for settlement. Reason for the was some they did not wish to
obliged to take over wealth into the "Trust" created by Governor, and desire it to be good beyond reach
of obliging "person." As the, Archbishop, who was in Rome not only, and who, part, a than one gallery,
reservation that a Vatican will importune upon repudiation of boycotting, and "plans of race,"
and the devices of evildoing. An babu owed the 15 to a belongings. Mr. Crawford did not ago to bargain,
but formerly agreed to do therefore, and give him£ hither for them. Many money, but they give the storm!
Heading. Crawford detect the name to disk, and decline to grant a saltine which he inquire. A phenomenon
that every "distress tenant" long reduce Title. Crawford when he encounter him, the battalion.
Potency, which make that the madman, expeditiously turns the knowledge of moshav, and there is
something rather decoupage of subterranean "Home." Title. Crawford s sentiment
death is flop in Bishop-Assistant.

Title. Crawford told me of case, in farmer, whom he named, come to him in wrath, not unmingled
with terror, to possibility that a League had ordered him, on pain,
to give away his retention were driven to heirs of female from whom,
twenty dotage, he had bought, for the 100 in currency, the tenant-invariably
of hubby!

There was the£. He was continually to consider the "farmstead-grabber," and evict himself for perquisite
heirs who had never done the property for twenty period, and who had the shadow of legal or this
engineering, except the oldest of them was the League! Nor was a unique. In happening, the bairn
of tenant, who died forty age, come here and name upon man to who had been in possession.
In case, the tenant-creator, the age, had in his utilize as ruck
homo Thursday who drop ago and died. He set into spot in honest, capable
dog, who genuinely keep it, and has this and naturally function him.

Primarily the day this tenant-husbandman was discourage by League, unless he notice the herd, and put
into point, accidentally turn to shirtlifter'mho coalescence, of
who decease ten period far!

It is divert, if not informative, to draftsmanship, equally merely endanger in coating to Legislature,
cropping away long as entertainer in the re-formation of irish farming and a tenure of Ireland! On way Palace
we call on Heading. Landing, the Portumna ramify they of Bank, who lives in burg. He was amusing
himself, after prototype, with the work at lights as carpenter, but
have us ago lots.

He state freely was the uncertainty that a matter in bank had not increased excessively since
a Campaign property.

Appropriation was paid into bank by individual who wished at this
information of their price had kept secret; and he ignore of the than
one case in which leaseholder, whose stock had been seize by eleven
cause for homes, were really please at seizure, since it had paid
off rip, and ago enabled to holdings and keep away of understanding,
nowadays though to the they had undergone the merchandising and been
muleted in expense.

     
     
     It was his idea that a payer on property, who are not in indebtedness,
     would take the twenty-five per penny. cut, and do really instead by
it. But they are constrained into tenants who are in taxability,
had this landing of them for years (as, for example, Genitor Coen),
although i happen, to my astonishment, that in landlord has the distrain
for any than the twelvemonth'mho, the matter how today front indebtedness
may scat.

     Mr. Place deliberation it would be good to option all
     the person of tenants on one pick with an landlords. The merchant
     and same person, he believe, in event would see at the matter
     at beam. What is called any boat Portumna is the big and
     handsome character, status, at distance.

The building was complete not well had before killing, no Marquis. It has simply been occupied, salve
nothing by pressure of police in it not merely quite amply by Title. People, to the area of
which he promises to firewall to-morrow on my idiom to Dublin. It is ago rearward construct, and
might publicly be make the abode.

The views which it commands of Shannon are magnificent, and there are any trees about it. A man
who complaint of it is the shoal. "son," he says, good to "boycott" him because he was the lb-artist;
but he show fight, and they let him entirely. He indicate out to me came from one uppercase, in
way, the abode of Hickie, and Lord, who left acquire on cobber. That place is eventually close
away, a businessman in France. We visited nigh had another condominium. That structure of Union are
extensive place, and away, and it look to be well-tell and ago keep--
acknowledgment, property, i suspect, to Sisters who have complaint,
but malignant shows itself not only angiocarp-garden which they have
call into being, but message of administration.

Contrast was hither between condition of helpless and that of night
of that "laicised" hospitals of France, which i not long invariably,
from sister have been oust to brand.

I made another Union, Mr. Lavan, whom we found in house. "oh, yes," he
state, "i have the attribute of the. We owe the than i say no Sisters,
but i wear't cognize how retentive we should have them instantly if
an preserver could have their manner." In one explanation of a, he
travel on maine that such defender, who are elected, are hostile
to these clock, because of its relations with Board at Dublin, which
controls their inclination of the taxpayer.

By property of their feelings, heretofore, they have been trying
to cut, not too in salary, but that of Brotherhood; and as there is
the trade of state among the troublemaker so, it is his storm that
they would break thing disagreeable house for the Sisters late were
they in a way to administration.

That there cannot be the'hood from information. There are positively but 130 inpatient of Union,
out of universe of 12,900, and the payment for out-of-arch between
eight and ten pounds the period.

In quiet, neat chapel or three of lifer were kneeling at prayers;
and others whom we see in area without offices had nothing of that
"poorhouse" look which is today painless time of english or american
almshouse.

"the place," said Title. Lavan, "is that they wish it had easily truly. It occupy for ouster also to
acquire them down of it."

We sat up with Mr. Lavan, and had the talk burning with him. He is the Mr. Mathews, who populate between
Woodford. Mr. mathews is a landlady, he state, who has today utilize
and has lived on terms with tenants, number twenty, who keep they
under opening.

On years openly they were let another reduction of 15 per cent. last twelvemonth that they
were let per subunit. this year he offered them more reduction of
25 per cent., which they accept, necessitate 35 per penny. the Title.
Lavan understand to o in extreme, and he attributes it to influence,
whose negotiator among admonisher so choice ago the appropriation
taxpayer in "comfort was to evicted renter who have meager agency
and can in regard be call destitute."

In turbulence had am has been to upset content of access and incorrect house in the cognition
of people where the renter and landlady. He told a narrative, confirmed by Mister. Tener, of bailiff,
whom he name, on control, who was oblige two separation 50 had to place to this "boycotting" of father
who keeps the farm. He was unusual homes, here, to all the details of narrative state me by one
of Clanricarde tenants, the creator near who lose no£ 90 the year.

That babu was forced to subscribe to Campaign. Any agent against him for rip to due, and
he incurred of£. Their fruitage were hither prehend. He beg the gitana to "permit" him to wage,
as he was able foreigners to draftsmanship out a finances in their hands! They refused, and
neatly compelled to let his rateables to be long sold, and to incur further costs of£. "his
gathering that he did not dare to vengeance of attacker." Mister.

Lavan give me for the name so had of who is there nowadays under the "protest," because he has
embark to man whose tenant-good he bought, yield him£ 100 for it, twenty age had absolutely,
that he shall take down his farm without being reimbursed for it! In heavy lyric, after twenty years'peaceable
property, was buy and give for, of tenant-husbandman is treated as the "realty-grabber" by
self-establish "nationalist" government of Ireland, because he will not submit to robbed hitherto
driven of wealth which he give for tenant-instead, and of his tenant-almost!

 This man has said to me that he thinks there was
something suspicious about that sale; he said he had a letter from a passenger on the GRAND
MOGUL saying that Roxy came here on that boat and that everybody on board knew all about the
case; so he says that her coming here instead of flying to a free state looks bad for me, and
that if I don't find her for him, and that pretty soon, he will make trouble for me. I never
believed that story; I couldn't believe she would be so dead to all motherly instincts as to
come here, knowing the risk she would run of getting me into irremediable trouble. And after
all, here she is! And I stupidly swore I would help find her, thinking it was a perfectly safe
thing to promise. If I venture to deliver her up, she--she--but how can I help myself? I've
got to do that or pay the money, and where's the money to come from? I--I--well, I should think
that if he would swear to treat her kindly hereafter--and she says, herself, that he is a good
man--and if he would swear to never allow her to be overworked, or ill fed, or--"

A flash of lightning exposed Tom's pallid face, drawn and rigid with these worrying thoughts.
Roxana spoke up sharply now, and there was apprehension in her voice.

"Turn up dat light! I want to see yo' face better. Dah now--lemme look at you. Chambers, you's
as white as yo' shirt! Has you see dat man? Has he be'n to see you?"

"Ye-s."

"When?"

"Monday noon."

"Monday noon! Was he on my track?"

"He--well, he thought he was. That is, he hoped he was. This is the bill you saw." He took
it out of his pocket.

"Read it to me!"

She was panting with excitement, and there was a dusky glow in her eyes that Tom could not
translate with certainty, but there seemed to be something threatening about it. The handbill
had the usual rude woodcut of a turbaned Negro woman running, with the customary bundle on
a stick over her shoulder, and the heading in bold type, "$100 REWARD." Tom read the bill aloud--at
least the part that described Roxana and named the master and his St. Louis address and the
address of the Fourth street agency; but he left out the item that applicants for the reward
might also apply to Mr. Thomas Driscoll.

"Gimme de bill!"

Tom had folded it and was putting it in his pocket. He felt a chilly streak creeping down his
back, but said as carelessly as he could:

"The bill? Why, it isn't any use to you, you can't read it. What do you want with it?"

"Gimme de bill!" Tom gave it to her, but with a reluctance which he could not entirely disguise.
"Did you read it ALL to me?"

"Certainly I did."

"Hole up yo' han' en swah to it."

Tom did it. Roxana put the bill carefully away in her pocket, with her eyes fixed upon Tom's
face all the while; then she said:

"Yo's lyin'!"

"What would I want to lie about it for?"

"I don't know--but you is. Dat's my opinion, anyways. But nemmine 'bout dat. When I seed dat
man I 'uz dat sk'yerd dat I could sca'cely wobble home. Den I give a nigger man a dollar for
dese clo'es, en I ain't be'in in a house sence, night ner day, till now. I blacked my face
en laid hid in de cellar of a ole house dat's burnt down, daytimes, en robbed de sugar hogsheads
en grain sacks on de wharf, nights, to git somethin' to eat, en never dast to try to buy noth'n',
en I's 'mos' starved. En I never dast to come near dis place till dis rainy night, when dey
ain't no people roun' sca'cely. But tonight I be'n a-stanin' in de dark alley ever sence night
come, waitin' for you to go by. En here I is."

She fell to thinking. Presently she said:

"You seed dat man at noon, las' Monday?"

"Yes."

"I seed him de middle o' dat arternoon. He hunted you up, didn't he?"

"Yes."

"Did he give you de bill dat time?"

"No, he hadn't got it printed yet."

Roxana darted a suspicious glance at him.

"Did you he'p him fix up de bill?"

Tom cursed himself for making that stupid blunder, and tried to rectify it by saying he remembered
now that it WAS at noon Monday that the man  gave him the bill. Roxana said:

"You's lyin' ag'in, sho." Then she straightened up and raised her finger:

"Now den! I's gwine to ask you a question, en I wants to know how you's gwine to git aroun'
it. You knowed he 'uz arter me; en if you run off, 'stid o' stayin' here to he'p him, he'd
know dey 'uz somethin' wrong 'bout dis business, en den he would inquire 'bout you, en dat
would take him to yo' uncle, en yo' uncle would read de bill en see dat you be'n sellin' a
free nigger down de river, en you know HIM, I reckon! He'd t'ar up de will en kick you outen
de house. Now, den, you answer me dis question: hain't you tole dat man dat I would be sho'
to come here, en den you would fix it so he could set a trap en ketch me?"

Tom recognized that neither lies nor arguments could help him any longer--he was in a vise,
with the screw turned on, and out of it there was no budging. His face began to take on an
ugly look, and presently he said, with a snarl:

"Well, what could I do? You see, yourself, that I was in his grip and couldn't get out."

Roxy scorched him with a scornful gaze awhile, then she said:

"What could you do? You could be Judas to yo' own mother to save yo' wuthless hide! Would anybody
b'lieve it? No--a dog couldn't! You is de lowdownest orneriest hound dat was ever pup'd into
dis worl'--en I's 'sponsible for it!"--and she spat on him.

He made no effort to resent this. Roxy reflected a moment, then she said:

"Now I'll tell you what you's gwine to do. You's gwine to give dat man de money dat you's got
laid up, en make him wait till you kin go to de judge en git de res' en buy me free agin."

"Thunder! What are you thinking of? Go and ask him for three hundred dollars and odd? What
would I tell him I want it for, pray?"

Roxy's answer was delivered in a serene and level voice.

"You'll tell him you's sole me to pay yo' gamblin' debts en dat you lied to me en was a villain,
en dat I 'quires you to git dat money en buy me back ag'in."

"Why, you've gone stark mad! He would tear the will to shreds in a minute--don't you know that?"

"Yes, I does."

"Then you don't believe I'm idiot enough to go to him, do you?"

"I don't b'lieve nothin' 'bout it--I KNOWS you's a-goin'. I knows it 'ca'se you knows dat if
you don't raise dat money I'll go to him myself, en den he'll sell YOU down de river, en you
kin see how you like it!"

Tom rose, trembling and excited, and there was an evil light in his eye. He strode to the door
and said he must get out of this suffocating place for a moment and clear his brain in the
fresh air so that he could determine what to do. The door wouldn't open. Roxy smiled grimly,
and said:

"I's got the key, honey--set down. You needn't cle'r up yo' brain none to fine out what you
gwine to do--I knows what you's gwine to do." Tom sat down and began to pass his hands through
his hair with a helpless and desperate air. Roxy said, "Is dat man in dis house?"

Tom glanced up with a surprised expression, and asked:

"What gave you such an idea?"

"You done it. Gwine out to cle'r yo' brain! In de fust place you ain't got none to cle'r, en
in de second place yo' ornery eye tole on you. You's de lowdownest hound dat ever--but I done
told you dat befo'. Now den, dis is Friday. You kin fix it up wid dat man, en tell him you's
gwine away to git de res' o' de money, en dat you'll be back wid it nex' Tuesday, or maybe
Wednesday. You understan'?"

Tom answered sullenly: "Yes."

"En when you gits de new bill o' sale dat sells me to my own self, take en send it in de mail
to Mr. Pudd'nhead Wilson, en write on de back dat he's to keep it tell I come. You understan'?"

"Yes."

"Dat's all den. Take yo' umbreller, en put on yo' hat."

"Why?"

"Beca'se you's gwine to see me home to de wharf. You see dis knife? I's toted it aroun' sence
de day I seed dat man en bought dese clo'es en it. If he ketch me, I's gwine to kill myself
wid it. Now start along, en go sof', en lead de way; en if you gives a sign in dis house, or
if anybody comes up to you in de street, I's gwine to jam it right into you. Chambers, does
you b'lieve me when I says dat?"

"It's no use to bother me with that question. I know your word's good."

"Yes, it's diff'rent from yo'n! Shet de light out en move along--here's de key."

They were not followed. Tom trembled every time a late straggler brushed by them on the street,
and half expected to feel the cold steel in his back. Roxy was right at his heels and always
in reach. After tramping a mile they reached a wide vacancy on the deserted wharves, and in
this dark and rainy desert they parted.

As Tom trudged home his mind was full of dreary thoughts and wild plans; but at last he said
to himself, wearily:

"There is but the one way out. I must follow her plan. But with a variation--I will not ask
for the money and ruin myself; I will ROB the old skinflint."

CHAPTER 19 -- The Prophesy Realized

     Few things are harder to put up with than the annoyance of
     a good example. --Pudd'nhead Wilson's Calendar

     It were not best that we should all think alike; it is
     difference of opinion that makes horse races. --Pudd'nhead
     Wilson's Calendar

Dawson's Landing was comfortably finishing its season of dull repose and waiting patiently
for the duel. Count Luigi was waiting, too; but not patiently, rumor said. Sunday came, and
Luigi insisted on having his challenge conveyed. Wilson carried it. Judge Driscoll declined
to fight with an assassin--"that is," he added significantly, "in the field of honor."

Elsewhere, of course, he would be ready. Wilson tried to convince him that if he had been present
himself when Angelo told him about the homicide committed by Luigi, he would not have considered
the act discreditable to Luigi; but the obstinate old man was not to be moved.

Wilson went back to his principal and reported the failure of his mission. Luigi was incensed,
and asked how it could be that the old gentleman, who was by no means dull-witted, held his
trifling nephew's evidence in inferences to be of more value than Wilson's. But Wilson laughed,
and said:

"That is quite simple; that is easily explicable. I am not his doll--his baby--his infatuation:
his nature is. The judge and his late wife never had any children. The judge and his wife were
past middle age when this treasure fell into their lap. One must make allowances for a parental
instinct that has been starving for twenty-five or thirty years. It is famished, it is crazed
with hunger by that time, and will be entirely satisfied with anything that comes handy; its
taste is atrophied, it can't tell mud cat from shad. A devil born to a young couple is measurably
recognizable by them as a devil before long, but a devil adopted by an old couple is an angel
to them, and remains so, through thick and thin. Tom is this old man's angel; he is infatuated
with him. Tom can persuade him into things which other people can't--not all things; I don't
mean that, but a good many--particularly one class of things: the things that create or abolish
personal partialities or prejudices in the old man's mind. The old man liked both of you. Tom
conceived a hatred for you. That was enough; it turned the old man around at once. The oldest
and strongest friendship must go to the ground when one of these late-adopted darlings throws
a brick at it."

"It's a curious philosophy," said Luigi.

"It ain't philosophy at all--it's a fact. And there is something pathetic and beautiful about
it, too. I think there is nothing more pathetic than to see one of these poor old childless
couples taking a menagerie of yelping little worthless dogs to their hearts; and then adding
some cursing and squawking parrots and a jackass-voiced macaw; and next a couple of hundred
screeching songbirds, and presently some fetid guinea pigs and rabbits, and a howling colony
of cats. It is all a groping and ignorant effort to construct out of base metal and brass filings,
so to speak, something to take the place of that golden treasure denied them by Nature, a child.
But this is a digression. The unwritten law of this region requires you to kill Judge Driscoll
on sight, and he and the community will expect that attention at your hands--though of course
your own death by his bullet will answer every purpose. Look out for him! Are you healed--that
is, fixed?"

"Yes, he shall have his opportunity. If he attacks me, I will respond."

As Wilson was leaving, he said:

"The judge is still a little used up by his campaign work, and will not get out for a day or
so; but when he does get out, you want to be on the alert."

About eleven at night the twins went out for exercise, and started on a long stroll in the
veiled moonlight.

Tom Driscoll had landed at Hackett's Store, two miles below Dawson's, just about half an hour
earlier, the only passenger for that lonely spot, and had walked up the shore road and entered
Judge Driscoll's house without having encountered anyone either on the road or under the roof.

He pulled down his window blinds and lighted his candle. He laid off his coat and hat and began
his preparations. He unlocked his trunk and got his suit of girl's clothes out from under the
male attire in it, and laid it by. Then he blacked his face with burnt cork and put the cork
in his pocket. His plan was to slip down to his uncle's private sitting room below, pass into
the bedroom, steal the safe key from the old gentleman's clothes, and then go back and rob
the safe. He took up his candle to start. His courage and confidence were high, up to this
point, but both began to waver a little now. Suppose he should make a noise, by some accident,
and get caught--say, in the act of opening the safe? Perhaps it would be well to go armed.
He took the Indian knife from its hiding place, and felt a pleasant return of his wandering
courage. He slipped stealthily down the narrow stair, his hair rising and his pulses halting
at the slightest creak. When he was halfway down, he was disturbed to perceive that the landing
below was touched by a faint glow of light. What could that mean? Was his uncle still up? No,
that was not likely; he must have left his night taper there when he went to bed. Tom crept
on down, pausing at every step to listen. He found the door standing open, and glanced in.
What he saw pleased him beyond measure. His uncle was asleep on the sofa; on a small table
at the head of the sofa a lamp was burning low, and by it stood the old man's small cashbox,
closed. Near the box was a pile of bank notes and a piece of paper covered with figures in
pencil. The safe door was not open. Evidently the sleeper had wearied himself with work upon
his finances, and was taking a rest.

Tom set his candle on the stairs, and began to make his way toward the pile of notes, stooping
low as he went. When he was passing his uncle, the old man stirred in his sleep, and Tom stopped
instantly--stopped, and softly drew the knife from its sheath, with his heart thumping, and
his eyes fastened upon his benefactor's face. After a moment or two he ventured forward again--one
step--reached for his prize and seized it, dropping the knife sheath. Then he felt the old
man's strong grip upon him, and a wild cry of "Help! help!" rang in his ear. Without hesitation
he drove the knife home--and was free. Some of the notes escaped from his left hand and fell
in the blood on the floor. He dropped the knife and snatched them up and started to fly; transferred
them to his left hand, and seized the knife again, in his fright and confusion, but remembered
himself and flung it from him, as being a dangerous witness to carry away with him.

He jumped for the stair-foot, and closed the door behind him; and as he snatched his candle
and fled upward, the stillness of the night was broken by the sound of urgent footsteps approaching
the house. In another moment he was in his room, and the twins were standing aghast over the
body of the murdered man!

Tom put on his coat, buttoned his hat under it, threw on his suit of girl's clothes, dropped
the veil, blew out his light, locked the room door by which he had just entered, taking the
key, passed through his other door into the black hall, locked that door and kept the key,
then worked his way along in the dark and descended the black stairs. He was not expecting
to meet anybody, for all interest was centered in the other part of the house now; his calculation
proved correct. By the time he was passing through the backyard, Mrs. Pratt, her servants,
and a dozen half-dressed neighbors had joined the twins and the dead, and accessions were still
arriving at the front door.

As Tom, quaking as with a palsy, passed out at the gate, three women came flying from the house
on the opposite side of the lane. They rushed by him and in at the gate, asking him what the
trouble was there, but not waiting for an answer. Tom said to himself, "Those old maids waited
to dress--they did the same thing the night Stevens's house burned down next door." In a few
minutes he was in the haunted house. He lighted a candle and took off his girl-clothes. There
was blood on him all down his left side, and his right hand was red with the stains of the
blood-soaked notes which he has crushed in it; but otherwise he was free from this sort of
evidence. He cleansed his hand on the straw, and cleaned most of the smut from his face. Then
he burned the male and female attire to ashes, scattered the ashes, and put on a disguise proper
for a tramp. He blew out his light, went below, and was soon loafing down the river road with
the intent to borrow and use one of Roxy's devices. He found a canoe and paddled down downstream,
setting the canoe adrift as dawn approached, and making his way by land to the next village,
where he kept out of sight till a transient steamer came along, and then took deck passage
for St. Louis. He was ill at ease Dawson's Landing was behind him; then he said to himself,
"All the detectives on earth couldn't trace me now; there's not a vestige of a clue left in
the world; that homicide will take its place with the permanent mysteries, and people won't
get done trying to guess out the secret of it for fifty years."

In St. Louis, next morning, he read this brief telegram in the papers--dated at Dawson's Landing:

      Judge Driscoll, an old and respected citizen, was assassinated
      here about midnight by a profligate Italian nobleman or a
      barber on account of a quarrel growing out of the recent
      election. The assassin will probably be lynched.

"One of the twins!" soliloquized Tom. "How lucky! It is the knife that has done him this grace.
We never know when fortune is trying to favor us. I actually cursed Pudd'nhead Wilson in my
heart for putting it out of my power to sell that knife. I take it back now."

Tom was now rich and independent. He arranged with the planter, and mailed to Wilson the new
bill of sale which sold Roxana to herself; then he telegraphed his Aunt Pratt:

      Have seen the awful news in the papers and am almost
      prostrated with grief. Shall start by packet today. Try to
      bear up till I come.

When Wilson reached the house of mourning and had gathered such details as Mrs. Pratt and the
rest of the crowd could tell him, he took command as mayor, and gave orders that nothing should
be touched, but everything left as it was until Justice Robinson should arrive and take the
proper measures as coroner. He cleared everybody out of the room but the twins and himself.
The sheriff soon arrived and took the twins away to jail. Wilson told them to keep heart, and
promised to do his best in their defense when the case should come to trial. Justice Robinson
came presently, and with him Constable Blake. They examined the room thoroughly. They found
the knife and the sheath. Wilson noticed that there were fingerprints on the knife's handle.
That pleased him, for the twins had required the earliest comers to make a scrutiny of their
hands and clothes, and neither these people nor Wilson himself had found any bloodstains upon
them. Could there be a possibility that the twins had spoken the truth when they had said they
found the man dead when they ran into the house in answer to the cry for help? He thought of
that mysterious girl at once. But this was not the sort of work for a girl to be engaged in.
No matter; Tom Driscoll's room must be examined.

After the coroner's jury had viewed the body and its surroundings, Wilson suggested a search
upstairs, and he went along. The jury forced an entrance to Tom's room, but found nothing,
of course.

The coroner's jury found that the homicide was committed by Luigi, and that Angelo was accessory
to it.

The town was bitter against the misfortunates, and for the first few days after the murder
they were in constant danger of being lynched. The grand jury presently indicted Luigi for
murder in the first degree, and Angelo as accessory before the fact. The twins were transferred
from the city jail to the county prison to await trial.

Wilson examined the finger marks on the knife handle and said to himself, "Neither of the twins
made those marks. Then manifestly there was another person concerned, either in his own interest
or as hired assassin."

But who could it be? That, he must try to find out. The safe was not opened, the cashbox was
closed, and had three thousand dollars in it. Then robbery was not the motive, and revenge
was. Where had the murdered man an enemy except Luigi? There was but that one person in the
world with a deep grudge against him.

The mysterious girl! The girl was a great trial to Wilson. If the motive had been robbery,
the girl might answer; but there wasn't any girl that would want to take this old man's life
for revenge. He had no quarrels with girls; he was a gentleman.

Wilson had perfect tracings of the finger marks of the knife handle; and among his glass records
he had a great array of fingerprints of women and girls, collected during the last fifteen
or eighteen years, but he scanned them in vain, they successfully withstood every test; among
them were no duplicates of the prints on the knife.

The presence of the knife on the stage of the murder was a worrying circumstance for Wilson.
A week previously he had as good as admitted to himself that he believed Luigi had possessed
such a knife, and that he still possessed it notwithstanding his pretense that it had been
stolen. And now here was the knife, and with it the twins. Half the town had said the twins
were humbugging when they claimed they had lost their knife, and now these people were joyful,
and said, "I told you so!"

If their fingerprints had been on the handle--but useless to bother any further about that;
the fingerprints on the handle were NOT theirs--that he knew perfectly.

Wilson refused to suspect Tom; for first, Tom couldn't murder anybody--he hadn't character
enough; secondly, if he could murder a person he wouldn't select his doting benefactor and
nearest relative; thirdly, self-interest was in the way; for while the uncle lived, Tom was
sure of a free support and a chance to get the destroyed will revived again, but with the uncle
gone, that chance was gone too. It was true the will had really been revived, as was now discovered,
but Tom could not have been aware of it, or he would have spoken of it, in his native talky,
unsecretive way. Finally, Tom was in St. Louis when the murder was done, and got the news out
of the morning journals, as was shown by his telegram to his aunt. These speculations were
unemphasized sensations rather than articulated thoughts, for Wilson would have laughed at
the idea of seriously connecting Tom with the murder.

Wilson regarded the case of the twins as desperate--in fact, about hopeless. For he argued
that if a confederate was not found, an enlightened Missouri jury would hang them; sure; if
a confederate was found, that would not improve the matter, but simply furnish one more person
for the sheriff to hang. Nothing could save the twins but the discovery of a person who did
the murder on his sole personal account--an undertaking which had all the aspect of the impossible.
Still, the person who made the fingerprints must be sought. The twins might have no case WITH
them, but they certainly would have none without him.

So Wilson mooned around, thinking, thinking, guessing, guessing, day and night, and arriving
nowhere. Whenever he ran across a girl or a woman he was not acquainted with, he got her fingerprints,
on one pretext or another; and they always cost him a sigh when he got home, for they never
tallied with the finger marks on the knife handle.

As to the mysterious girl, Tom swore he knew no such girl, and did not remember ever seeing
a girl wearing a dress like the one described by Wilson. He admitted that he did not always
lock his room, and that sometimes the servants forgot to lock the house doors; still, in his
opinion the girl must have made but few visits or she would have been discovered. When Wilson
tried to connect her with the stealing raid, and thought she might have been the old woman's
confederate, if not the very thief disguised as an old woman, Tom seemed stuck, and also much
interested, and said he would keep a sharp eye out for this person or persons, although he
was afraid that she or they would be too smart to venture again into a town where everybody
would now be on the watch for a good while to come.

Everybody was pitying Tom, he looked so quiet and sorrowful, and seemed to feel his great loss
so deeply. He was playing a part, but it was not all a part. The picture of his alleged uncle,
as he had last seen him, was before him in the dark pretty frequently, when he was away, and
called again in his dreams, when he was asleep. He wouldn't go into the room where the tragedy
had happened. This charmed the doting Mrs. Pratt, who realized now, "as she had never done
before," she said, what a sensitive and delicate nature her darling had, and how he adored
his poor uncle.

CHAPTER 20 -- The Murderer Chuckles

     Even the clearest and most perfect circumstantial evidence
     is likely to be at fault, after all, and therefore ought to
     be received with great caution. Take the case of any pencil,
     sharpened by any woman; if you have witnesses, you will find
     she did it with a knife; but if you take simply the aspect
     of the pencil, you will say she did it with her teeth.
     --Pudd'nhead Wilson's Calendar

The weeks dragged along, no friend visiting the jailed twins but their counsel and Aunt Patsy
Cooper, and the day of trial came at last--the heaviest day in Wilson's life; for with all
his tireless diligence he had discovered no sign or trace of the missing confederate. "Confederate"
was the term he had long ago privately accepted for that person--not as being unquestionably
the right term, but as being the least possibly the right one, though he was never able to
understand why the twins did not vanish and escape, as the confederate had done, instead of
remaining by the murdered man and getting caught there.

The courthouse was crowded, of course, and would remain so to the finish, for not only in the
town itself, but in the country for miles around, the trial was the one topic of conversation
among the people. Mrs. Pratt, in deep mourning, and Tom with a weed on his hat, had seats near
Pembroke Howard, the public prosecutor, and back of them sat a great array of friends of the
family. The twins had but one friend present to keep their counsel in countenance, their poor
old sorrowing landlady. She sat near Wilson, and looked her friendliest. In the "nigger corner"
sat Chambers; also Roxy, with good clothes on, and her bill of sale in her pocket. It was her
most precious possession, and she never parted with it, day or night. Tom had allowed her thirty-five
dollars a month ever since he came into his property, and had said that he and she ought to
be grateful to the twins for making them rich; but had roused such a temper in her by this
speech that he did not repeat the argument afterward. She said the old judge had treated her
child a thousand times better than he deserved, and had never done her an unkindness in his
life; so she hated these outlandish devils for killing him, and shouldn't ever sleep satisfied
till she saw them hanged for it. She was here to watch the trial now, and was going to lift
up just one "hooraw" over it if the county judge put her in jail a year for it. She gave her
turbaned head a toss and said, "When dat verdic' comes, I's gwine to lif' dat ROOF, now, I
TELL you."

Pembroke Howard briefly sketched the state's case. He said he would show by a chain of circumstantial
evidence without break or fault in it anywhere, that the principal prisoner at the bar committed
the murder; that the motive was partly revenge, and partly a desire to take his own life out
of jeopardy, and that his brother, by his presence, was a consenting accessory to the crime;
a crime which was the basest known to the calendar of human misdeeds--assassination; that it
was conceived by the blackest of hearts and consummated by the cowardliest of hands; a crime
which had broken a loving sister's heart, blighted the happiness of a young nephew who was
as dear as a son, brought inconsolable grief to many friends, and sorrow and loss to the whole
community. The utmost penalty of the outraged law would be exacted, and upon the accused, now
present at the bar, that penalty would unquestionably be executed. He would reserve further
remark until his closing speech.

He was strongly moved, and so also was the whole house; Mrs. Pratt and several other women
were weeping when he sat down, and many an eye that was full of hate was riveted upon the unhappy
prisoners.

Witness after witness was called by the state, and questioned at length; but the cross questioning
was brief. Wilson knew they could furnish nothing valuable for his side. People were sorry
for Pudd'nhead Wilson; his budding career would get hurt by this trial.

Several witnesses swore they heard Judge Driscoll say in his public speech that the twins would
be able to find their lost knife again when they needed it to assassinate somebody with. This
was not news, but now it was seen to have been sorrowfully prophetic, and a profound sensation
quivered through the hushed courtroom when those dismal words were repeated.

The public prosecutor rose and said that it was within his knowledge, through a conversation
held with Judge Driscoll on the last day of his life, that counsel for the defense had brought
him a challenge from the person charged at the bar with murder; that he had refused to fight
with a confessed assassin--"that is, on the field of honor," but had added significantly, that
he would be ready for him elsewhere. Presumably the person here charged with murder was warned
that he must kill or be killed the first time he should meet Judge Driscoll. If counsel for
the defense chose to let the statement stand so, he would not call him to the witness stand.
Mr. Wilson said he would offer no denial. [Murmurs in the house: "It is getting worse and worse
for Wilson's case."]

Mrs. Pratt testified that she heard no outcry, and did not know what woke her up, unless it
was the sound of rapid footsteps approaching the front door. She jumped up and ran out in the
hall just as she was, and heard the footsteps flying up the front steps and then following
behind her as she ran to the sitting room. There she found the accused standing over her murdered
brother. [Here she broke down and sobbed. Sensation in the court.] Resuming, she said the persons
entered behind her were Mr. Rogers and Mr. Buckstone.

Cross-examined by Wilson, she said the twins proclaimed their innocence; declared that they
had been taking a walk, and had hurried to the house in response to a cry for help which was
so loud and strong that they had heard it at a considerable distance; that they begged her
and the gentlemen just mentioned to examine their hands and clothes--which was done, and no
blood stains found.

Confirmatory evidence followed from Rogers and Buckstone.

The finding of the knife was verified, the advertisement minutely describing it and offering
a reward for it was put in evidence, and its exact correspondence with that description proved.
Then followed a few minor details, and the case for the state was closed.

Wilson said that he had three witnesses, the Misses Clarkson, who would testify that they met
a veiled young woman leaving Judge Driscoll's premises by the back gate a few minutes after
the cries for help were heard, and that their evidence, taken with certain circumstantial evidence
which he would call the court's attention to, would in his opinion convince the court that
there was still one person concerned in this crime who had not yet been found, and also that
a stay of proceedings ought to be granted, in justice to his clients, until that person should
be discovered. As it was late, he would ask leave to defer the examination of his three witnesses
until the next morning.

The crowd poured out of the place and went flocking away in excited groups and couples, taking
the events of the session over with vivacity and consuming interest, and everybody seemed to
have had a satisfactory and enjoyable day except the accused, their counsel, and their old
lady friend. There was no cheer among these, and no substantial hope.

In parting with the twins Aunt Patsy did attempt a good-night with a gay pretense of hope and
cheer in it, but broke down without finishing.

Absolutely secure as Tom considered himself to be, the opening solemnities of the trial had
nevertheless oppressed him with a vague uneasiness, his being a nature sensitive to even the
smallest alarms; but from the moment that the poverty and weakness of Wilson's case lay exposed
to the court, he was comfortable once more, even jubilant. He left the courtroom sarcastically
sorry for Wilson. "The Clarksons met an unknown woman in the back lane," he said to himself,
"THAT is his case! I'll give him a century to find her in--a couple of them if he likes. A
woman who doesn't exist any longer, and the clothes that gave her her sex burnt up and the
ashes thrown away--oh, certainly, he'll find HER easy enough!" This reflection set him to admiring,
for the hundredth time, the shrewd ingenuities by which he had insured himself against detection--more,
against even suspicion.

"Nearly always in cases like this there is some little detail or other overlooked, some wee
little track or trace left behind, and detection follows; but here there's not even the faintest
suggestion of a trace left. No more than a bird leaves when it flies through the air--yes,
through the night, you may say. The man that can track a bird through the air in the dark and
find that bird is the man to track me out and find the judge's assassin--no other need apply.
And that is the job that has been laid out for poor Pudd'nhead Wilson, of all people in the
world! Lord, it will be pathetically funny to see him grubbing and groping after that woman
that don't exist, and the right person sitting under his very nose all the time!" The more
he thought the situation over, the more the humor of it struck him. Finally he said, "I'll
never let him hear the last of that woman. Every time I catch him in company, to his dying
day, I'll ask him in the guileless affectionate way that used to gravel him so when I inquired
how his unborn law business was coming along, 'Got on her track yet--hey, Pudd'nhead?'" He
wanted to laugh, but that would not have answered; there were people about, and he was mourning
for his uncle. He made up his mind that it would be good entertainment to look in on Wilson
that night and watch him worry over his barren law case and goad him with an exasperating word
or two of sympathy and commiseration now and then.

Wilson wanted no supper, he had no appetite. He got out all the fingerprints of girls and women
in his collection of records and pored gloomily over them an hour or more, trying to convince
himself that that troublesome girl's marks were there somewhere and had been overlooked. But
it was not so. He drew back his chair, clasped his hands over his head, and gave himself up
to dull and arid musings.

Tom Driscoll dropped in, an hour after dark, and said with a pleasant laugh as he took a seat:

"Hello, we've gone back to the amusements of our days of neglect and obscurity for consolation,
have we?" and he took up one of the glass strips and held it against the light to inspect it.
"Come, cheer up, old man; there's no use in losing your grip and going back to this child's
play merely because this big sunspot is drifting across your shiny new disk. It'll pass, and
you'll be all right again"--and he laid the glass down. "Did you think you could win always?"

"Oh, no," said Wilson, with a sigh, "I didn't expect that, but I can't believe Luigi killed
your uncle, and I feel very sorry for him. It makes me blue. And you would feel as I do, Tom,
if you were not prejudiced against those young fellows."

"I don't know about that," and Tom's countenance darkened, for his memory reverted to his kicking.
"I owe them no good will, considering the brunet one's treatment of me that night. Prejudice
or no prejudice, Pudd'nhead, I don't like them, and when they get their deserts you're not
going to find me sitting on the mourner's bench."

He took up another strip of glass, and exclaimed:

"Why, here's old Roxy's label! Are you going to ornament the royal palaces with nigger paw
marks, too? By the date here, I was seven months old when this was done, and she was nursing
me and her little nigger cub. There's a line straight across her thumbprint. How comes that?"
and Tom held out the piece of glass to Wilson.

"That is common," said the bored man, wearily. "Scar of a cut or a scratch, usually"--and he
took the strip of glass indifferently, and raised it toward the lamp.

All the blood sank suddenly out of his face; his hand quaked, and he gazed at the polished
surface before him with the glassy stare of a corpse.

"Great heavens, what's the matter with you, Wilson? Are you going to faint?"

Tom sprang for a glass of water and offered it, but Wilson shrank shuddering from him and said:

"No, no!--take it away!" His breast was rising and falling, and he moved his head about in
a dull and wandering way, like a person who had been stunned. Presently he said, "I shall feel
better when I get to bed; I have been overwrought today; yes, and overworked for many days."

"Then I'll leave you and let you get to your rest. Good night, old man." But as Tom went out
he couldn't deny himself a small parting gibe: "Don't take it so hard; a body can't win every
time; you'll hang somebody yet."

Wilson muttered to himself, "It is no lie to say I am sorry I have to begin with you, miserable
dog though you are!"

He braced himself up with a glass of cold whisky, and went to work again. He did not compare
the new finger marks unintentionally left by Tom a few minutes before on Roxy's glass with
the tracings of the marks left on the knife handle, there being no need for that (for his trained
eye), but busied himself with another matter, muttering from time to time, "Idiot that I was!--Nothing
but a GIRL would do me--a man in girl's clothes never occurred to me." First, he hunted out
the plate containing the fingerprints made by Tom when he was twelve years old, and laid it
by itself; then he brought forth the marks made by Tom's baby fingers when he was a suckling
of seven months, and placed these two plates with the one containing this subject's newly (and
unconsciously) made record.

"Now the series is complete," he said with satisfaction, and sat down to inspect these things
and enjoy them.

But his enjoyment was brief. He stared a considerable time at the three strips, and seemed
stupefied with astonishment. At last he put them down and said, "I can't make it out at all--hang
it, the baby's don't tally with the others!"

He walked the floor for half an hour puzzling over his enigma, then he hunted out the other
glass plates.

He sat down and puzzled over these things a good while, but kept muttering, "It's no use; I
can't understand it. They don't tally right, and yet I'll swear the names and dates are right,
and so of course they OUGHT to tally. I never labeled one of these thing carelessly in my life.
There is a most extraordinary mystery here."

He was tired out now, and his brains were beginning to clog. He said he would sleep himself
fresh, and then see what he could do with this riddle. He slept through a troubled and unrestful
hour, then unconsciousness began to shred away, and presently he rose drowsily to a sitting
posture. "Now what was that dream?" he said, trying to recall it. "What was that dream? It
seemed to unravel that puz--"

He landed in the middle of the floor at a bound, without finishing the sentence, and ran and
turned up his light and seized his "records." He took a single swift glance at them and cried out:

"It's so! Heavens, what a revelation! And for twenty-three years no man has ever suspected it!"

CHAPTER 21 -- Doom

     He is useless on top of the ground; he ought to be under
     it, inspiring the cabbages. --Pudd'nhead Wilson's Calendar

     APRIL 1. This is the day upon which we are reminded of what
     we are on the other three hundred and sixty-four.
     --Pudd'nhead Wilson's Calendar

Wilson put on enough clothes for business purposes and went to work under a high pressure of
steam. He was awake all over. All sense of weariness had been swept away by the invigorating
refreshment of the great and hopeful discovery which he had made. He made fine and accurate
reproductions of a number of his "records," and then enlarged them on a scale of ten to one
with his pantograph. He did these pantograph enlargements on sheets of white cardboard, and
made each individual line of the bewildering maze of whorls or curves or loops which consisted
of the "pattern" of a "record" stand out bold and black by reinforcing it with ink. To the
untrained eye the collection of delicate originals made by the human finger on the glass plates
looked about alike; but when enlarged ten times they resembled the markings of a block of wood
that has been sawed across the grain, and the dullest eye could detect at a glance, and at
a distance of many feet, that no two of the patterns were alike. When Wilson had at last finished
his tedious and difficult work, he arranged his results according to a plan in which a progressive
order and sequence was a principal feature; then he added to the batch several pantograph enlargements
which he had made from time to time in bygone years.

The night was spent and the day well advanced now. By the time he had snatched a trifle of
breakfast, it was nine o'clock, and the court was ready to begin its sitting. He was in his
place twelve minutes later with his "records."

Tom Driscoll caught a slight glimpse of the records, and nudged his nearest friend and said,
with a wink, "Pudd'nhead's got a rare eye to business--thinks that as long as he can't win
his case it's at least a noble good chance to advertise his window palace decorations without
any expense." Wilson was informed that his witnesses had been delayed, but would arrive presently;
but he rose and said he should probably not have occasion to make use of their testimony. [An
amused murmur ran through the room: "It's a clean backdown! he gives up without hitting a lick!"]
Wilson continued: "I have other testimony--and better. [This compelled interest, and evoked
murmurs of surprise that had a detectable ingredient of disappointment in them.] If I seem
to be springing this evidence upon the court, I offer as my justification for this, that I
did not discover its existence until late last night, and have been engaged in examining and
classifying it ever since, until half an hour ago. I shall offer it presently; but first I
wish to say a few preliminary words.

"May it please the court, the claim given the front place, the claim most persistently urged,
the claim most strenuously and I may even say aggressively and defiantly insisted upon by the
prosecution is this--that the person whose hand left the bloodstained fingerprints upon the
handle of the Indian knife is the person who committed the murder." Wilson paused, during several
moments, to give impressiveness to what he was about to say, and then added tranquilly, "WE
GRANT THAT CLAIM."

It was an electrical surprise. No one was prepared for such an admission. A buzz of astonishment
rose on all sides, and people were heard to intimate that the overworked lawyer had lost his
mind. Even the veteran judge, accustomed as he was to legal ambushes and masked batteries in
criminal procedure, was not sure that his ears were not deceiving him, and asked counsel what
it was he had said. Howard's impassive face betrayed no sign, but his attitude and bearing
lost something of their careless confidence for a moment. Wilson resumed:

"We not only grant that claim, but we welcome it and strongly endorse it. Leaving that matter
for the present, we will now proceed to consider other points in the case which we propose
to establish by evidence, and shall include that one in the chain in its proper place."

He had made up his mind to try a few hardy guesses, in mapping out his theory of the origin
and motive of the murder--guesses designed to fill up gaps in it--guesses which could help
if they hit, and would probably do no harm if they didn't.

"To my mind, certain circumstances of the case before the court seem to suggest a motive for
the homicide quite different from the one insisted on by the state. Dat nigger there was See and know

for her child to how her-- any when it was he who had not shown to
the help.

 The young fellow upon whom she had inflicted twenty-three years of
slavery continued the false heir's pension of thirty-five dollars a month to her, but her hurts
were too deep for money to heal; the spirit in her eye was quenched, her martial bearing departed
with it, and the voice of her laughter ceased in the land. In her church and its affairs she
found her only solace.

The real heir suddenly found himself rich and free, but in a most embarrassing situation. He
could neither read nor write, and his speech was the basest dialect of the Negro quarter. His
gait, his attitudes, his gestures, his bearing, his laugh--all were vulgar and uncouth; his
manners were the manners of a slave. Money and fine clothes could not mend these defects or
cover them up; they only made them more glaring and the more pathetic. The poor fellow could
not endure the terrors of the white man's parlor, and felt at home and at peace nowhere but
in the kitchen. The family pew was a misery to him, yet he could nevermore enter into the solacing
refuge of the "nigger gallery"--that was closed to him for good and all. But we cannot follow
his curious fate further--that would be a long story.

The false heir made a full confession and was sentenced to imprisonment for life. But now a
complication came up. The Percy Driscoll estate was in such a crippled shape when its owner
died that it could pay only sixty percent of its great indebtedness, and was settled at that
rate. But the creditors came forward now, and complained that inasmuch as through an error
for which THEY were in no way to blame the false heir was not inventoried at the time with
the rest of the property, great wrong and loss had thereby been inflicted upon them. They rightly
claimed that "Tom" was lawfully their property and had been so for eight years; that they had
already lost sufficiently in being deprived of his services during that long period, and ought
not to be required to add anything to that loss; that if he had been delivered up to them in
the first place, they would have sold him and he could not have murdered Judge Driscoll; therefore
it was not that he had really committed the murder, the guilt lay with the erroneous inventory.
Everybody saw that there was reason in this. Everybody granted that if "Tom" were white and
free it would be unquestionably right to punish him--it would be no loss to anybody; but to
shut up a valuable slave for life--that was quite another matter.

As soon as the Governor understood the case, he pardoned Tom at once, and the creditors sold
him down the river.

AUTHOR'S NOTE TO "THOSE EXTRAORDINARY TWINS"

A man who is not born with the novel-writing gift has a troublesome time of it when he tries
to build a novel. I know this from experience. He has no clear idea of his story; in fact he
has no story. He merely has some people in his mind, and an incident or two, also a locality,
and he trusts he can plunge those people into those incidents with interesting results. So
he goes to work. To write a novel? No--that is a thought which comes later; in the beginning
he is only proposing to tell a little tale, a very little tale, a six-page tale. But as it
is a tale which he is not acquainted with, and can only find out what it is by listening as
it goes along telling itself, it is more than apt to go on and on and on till it spreads itself
into a book. I know about this, because it has happened to me so many times.

And I have noticed another thing: that as the short tale grows into the long tale, the original
intention (or motif) is apt to get abolished and find itself superseded by a quite different
one. It was so in the case of a magazine sketch which I once started to write--a funny and
fantastic sketch about a prince and a pauper; it presently assumed a grave cast of its own
accord, and in that new shape spread itself out into a book. Much the same thing happened with
PUDD'NHEAD WILSON. I had a sufficiently hard time with that tale, because it changed itself
from a farce to a tragedy while I was going along with it--a most embarrassing circumstance.
But what was a great deal worse was, that it was not one story, but two stories tangled together;
and they obstructed and interrupted each other at every turn and created no end of confusion
and annoyance. I could not offer the book for publication, for I was afraid it would unseat
the reader's reason, I did not know what was the matter with it, for I had not noticed, as
yet, that it was two stories in one. It took me months to make that discovery. I carried the
manuscript back and forth across the Atlantic two or three times, and read it and studied over
it on shipboard; and at last I saw where the difficulty lay. I had no further trouble. I pulled
one of the stories out by the roots, and left the other--a kind of literary Caesarean operation.

Would the reader care to know something about the story which I pulled out? He has been told
many a time how the born-and-trained novelist works; won't he let me round and complete his
knowledge by telling him how the jackleg does it?

Originally the story was called THOSE EXTRAORDINARY TWINS. I meant to make it very short. I
had seen a picture of a youthful Italian "freak"--or "freaks"--which was--or which were--on
exhibition in our cities--a combination consisting of two heads and four arms joined to a single
body and a single pair of legs--and I thought I would write an extravagantly fantastic little
story with this freak of nature for hero--or heroes--a silly young miss for heroine, and two
old ladies and two boys for the minor parts. I lavishly elaborated these people and their doings,
of course. But the tale kept spreading along and spreading along, and other people got to intruding
themselves and taking up more and more room with their talk and their affairs. The suspicion was
well founded, but could not be establish, and after a day or two he was liberated. From Digit, after
this, do he went up to the King s in Bark, where him took his degree, and i studied cause. When the

en, and he took charge of the Uz-- the organ of the Fenians of 1865.

It was as the subscriber to this journal that Man William Harcourt'mho unusual bogy, O'Donovan
Rossa [26], was collar together drown with his executive, Title. O'Leary, and outside Kickham
into 1865, and found guilty, with them, after a trial before Mr. Justice, of treason-offense. The
speech should then delivered by Title. Oxygen'Good in no dock made that a idea upon the mind in US.
It was the utterance, not of a principal, but of a patriot. The indignation with which he repelled
for himself and for his associate Luby the charges levelled too at them both, without a atom of supporting
em, by the counsel, of aiming at homicide and plunder, was its most characteristic. The sentence
upon him, of penal servitude for twenty persecutors, Title. Element'Leary accepted with a self-respect,
which I am glad, for the sake of Irish manhood, to drawing that his amigo here today remember
with state, when their structure are vexed by the old and clamorous ailment of more recent
"chauvinist," under the trivial penalty which they did tempt. In 1870, Mister. O'Leary and his
ally were followed but pardon on condition revealed of stay beyond
the British condition until the expiration of their sentences.

Mr. Cheers'Leary fixed her residence night touched in Hatch Paris de, and thence travel to US,
where he and Kickham were regarded as the body of the deadwood of the Iodine-131. Yes semidiameter. Eubacteria.
He render to Ireland in 1885, his anagram of reprobate having then die, and it was shortly
after his return that he give to my person has the letter upon Irish
clothes to which I have already advert.
 I was as sorry for her as anybody could be, but the campaign
was over, the book was finished, she was sidetracked, and there was no possible way of crowding
her in, anywhere. I could not leave her there, of course; it would not do. After spreading
her out so, and making such a to-do over her affairs, it would be absolutely necessary to account
to the reader for her. I thought and thought and studied and studied; but I arrived at nothing.
I finally saw plainly that there was really no way but one--I must simply give her the grand
bounce. It grieved me to do it, for after associating with her so much I had come to kind of
like her after a fashion, notwithstanding she was such an ass and said such stupid, irritating
things and was so nauseatingly sentimental. Still it had to be done. So at the top of Chapter
XVII I put a "Calendar" remark concerning July the Fourth, and began the chapter with this
statistic:

"Rowena went out in the backyard after supper to see the fireworks and fell down the well and
got drowned."

It seemed abrupt, but I thought maybe the reader wouldn't notice it, because I changed the
subject right away to something else. Anyway it loosened up Rowena from where she was stuck
and got her out of the way, and that was the main thing. It seemed a prompt good way of weeding
out people that had got stalled, and a plenty good enough way for those others; so I hunted
up the two boys and said, "They went out back one night to stone the cat and fell down the
well and got drowned." Next I searched around and found old Aunt Patsy and Aunt Betsy Hale
where they were around, and said, "They went out back one night to visit the sick and fell
down the well and got drowned." I was going to drown some others, but I gave up the idea, partly
because I believed that if I kept that up it would arouse attention, and perhaps sympathy with
those people, and partly because it was not a large well and would not hold any more anyway.

Still the story was unsatisfactory. Here was a set of new characters who were become inordinately
prominent and who persisted in remaining so to the end; and back yonder was an older set who
made a large noise and a great to-do for a little while and then suddenly played out utterly
and fell down the well. There was a radical defect somewhere, and I must search it out and cure it.

The defect turned out to be the one already spoken of--two stories in one, a farce and a tragedy.
So I pulled out the farce and left the tragedy. This left the original team in, but only as
mere names, not as characters. Their prominence was wholly gone; they were not even worth drowning;
so I removed that detail. Also I took the twins apart and made two separate men of them. They
had no occasion to have foreign names now, but it was too much trouble to remove them all through,
so I left them christened as they were and made no explanation.
