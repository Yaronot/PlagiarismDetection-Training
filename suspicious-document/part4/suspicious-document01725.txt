When Captain Carey went on his long journey into the unknown and uncharted land, the rest of
the Careys tried in vain for a few months to be still a family, and did not succeed at all.
They clung as closely to one another as ever they could, but there was always a gap in the
circle where father had been. Some men, silent, unresponsive, absent-minded and especially
absorbed in business, might drop out and not be missed, but Captain Carey was full of vitality,
warmth, and high spirits. It is strange so many men think that the possession of a child makes
them a father; it does not; but it is a curious and very general misapprehension. Captain Carey
was a boy with his boys, and a gallant lover with his girls; to his wife--oh! we will not even
touch upon that ground; she never did, to any one or anything but her own heart! Which of the
three dollars is the interesting to you? Which sounds the best when it read aloud? Nowadays state
what you detect to the property of each.

Which is the pathetic? Reread the three selections very carelessly. Which
is the most humorous?

To be the last was by far the easiest, for the earliest effort at economy had been the reluctant
dismissal of Joanna, the chambermaid. In old-fashioned novels the devoted servant always insisted
on remaining without wages, but this story concerns itself with life at a later date. Joanna
wept at the thought of leaving, but she never thought of the romantic and illogical expedient
of staying on without compensation.

Captain Carey's salary had been five thousand dollars, or rather was to have been, for he had
only attained his promotion three months before his death. I have been close to tell you but never
little work that it is going on us, and you must not for moment might
never justify as we have fully made the nature.

Look at the daisies when a storm is threatening. We are gradually learning that everything which
a plant does has its meaning, if we can be only find it out.

And when we are new to this, a flower to b may become a world to us if
we do open our oculus justify to that is going on in it called.

Again, such
flowers able whenever rain is coming.
 Mrs. Carey realized
that that was the only proper thing to do when there were four children under fifteen to be
considered. The pressing question, however, was how to keep it in the bank, and subsist on
a captain's pension of thirty dollars a month. There was the ten thousand, hers and the Captain's,
in Allan Carey's business, but Allan was seriously ill with nervous prostration, and no money
put into his business ever had come out, even in a modified form. The Admiral was at the other
end of the world, and even had he been near at hand Mrs. Carey would never have confided the
family difficulties to him. She could hardly have allowed him even to tide her over her immediate
pressing anxieties, remembering his invalid sister and his many responsibilities. No, the years
until Gilbert was able to help, or Nancy old enough to use her talents, or the years before
the money invested with Allan would bring dividends, those must be years of self-sacrifice
on everybody's part; and more even than that, they must be fruitful years, in which not mere
saving and economizing, but earning, would be necessary.

It was only lately that Mrs. Carey had talked over matters with the three eldest children,
but the present house was too expensive to be longer possible as a home, and the question of
moving was a matter of general concern. Joanna had been, up to the present moment, the only
economy, but alas! Joanna was but a drop in the necessary bucket.
