Her Majesty the Queen of Naples had been sent to Brannan, by the Emperor to receive the Empress.
Queen Caroline, of whom the Emperor once said that she was a man among her sisters, as Prince
Joseph was a woman among his brothers, mistook, it is said, the timidity of Marie Louise for
weakness, and thought that she would only have to speak and her young sister-in-law would hasten
to obey.  On her arrival at Brannan the formal transfer was solemnly made; and the Empress
bade farewell to all her Austrian household, retaining in her service only her first lady of
honor, Madame de Lajanski, who had reared her and never been absent from her.  Etiquette required
that the household of the Empress should be entirely French, and the orders of the Emperor
were very precise in this regard; but I do not know whether it is true, as has been stated,
that the Empress had demanded and obtained from the Emperor permission to retain for a year
this lady of honor.  However that may be, the Queen of Naples thought it to her interest to
remove a person whose influence over the mind of the Empress she so much feared; and as the
ladies of the household of her Imperial Majesty were themselves eager to be rid of the rivalry
of Madame de Lajanski, and endeavored to excite still more the jealousy of her Imperial highness,
a positive order was demanded from the Emperor, and Madame de Lajanski was sent back from Munich
to Vienna. The Empress obeyed without complaint, but knowing who had instigated the blow, cherished
a profound resentment against her Majesty the Queen of Naples.  The Empress traveled only by
short stages, and was welcomed by fetes in each town through which she passed.  Each day the
Emperor sent her a letter from his own hand, and she replied regularly.  The first letters
of the Empress were very short, and probably cold, for the Emperor said nothing about them;
but afterwards they grew longer and gradually more affectionate, and the Emperor read them
in transports of delight, awaiting the arrival of these letters with the impatience of a lover
twenty years of age, and always saying the couriers traveled slowly, although they broke down
their horses.

The Emperor returned from the chase one day holding in his hands two pheasants which he had
himself killed, and followed by footmen bearing in their hands the rarest flowers from the
conservatory of Saint-Cloud.  He wrote a note, and immediately said to his first page, "In
ten minutes be ready to enter your carriage.  You will find there this package which you will
give with your own hand to her Majesty the Empress, with the accompanying letter.  Above all
do not spare the horses; go as fast as possible, and fear nothing.  The Duke of Vicenza shall
say nothing to you."  The young man asked nothing better than to obey his Majesty; and strong
in this authority, which gave him perfect liberty, he did not grudge drink money to the postilions,
and in twenty-four hours had reached Strasburg and delivered his message.

I do not know whether he received a reprimand from the grand equerry on his return; but if
there was any cause for this, the latter would not have failed to bestow it, in spite of the
Emperor's assurance to the first page.  The Duke of Vicenza had organized and kept in admirable
order the service of the stables, where nothing was done except by his will, which was most
absolute; and it was only with the greatest difficulty that the Emperor himself could change
an order which the grand equerry had given.  For instance, his Majesty was one day en route
to Fontainebleau, and being very anxious to arrive quickly, gave orders to the outrider who
regulated the gait of the horses, to go faster.  This order he transmitted to the Duke of Vicenza
whose carriage preceded that of the Emperor; and finding that the grand equerry paid no attention
to this order, the Emperor began to swear, and cried to the outrider through the door, "Let
my carriage pass in front, since those in front will not go on."  The outriders and postilions
were about to execute this maneuver when the grand equerry also put his head out of the door
and exclaimed, "Keep to a trot, the first man who gallops I will dismiss on arriving." It was
well known that he would keep his word, so no one dared to pass, and his carriage continued
to regulate the pace of the others.  On reaching Fontainebleau the Emperor demanded of the
Duke of Vicenza an explanation of his conduct.  "Sire," replied the duke to his Majesty, "when
you allow me a larger sum for the expenses of the stables, you can kill your horses at your
pleasure."

The Emperor cursed every moment the ceremonials and fetes which delayed the arrival of his
young wife.  A camp had been formed near Soissons for the reception of the Empress.  The Emperor
was now at Compiegne, where he made a decree containing several clauses of benefits and indulgences
on the occasion of his marriage, setting at liberty many condemned, giving Imperial marriage
dowries to six thousand soldiers, amnesties, promotions, etc.  At length his Majesty learned
that the Empress was not more than ten leagues from Soissons, and no longer able to restrain
his impatience, called me with all his might, "Ohe ho, Constant!  order a carriage without
livery, and come and dress me."  The Emperor wished to surprise the Empress, and present himself
to her without being announced; and laughed immoderately at the effect this would produce.
He attended to his toilet with even more exquisite care than usual, if that were possible,
and with the coquetry of glory dressed himself in the gray redingote he had worn at Wagram;
and thus arrayed, the Emperor entered a carriage with the King of Naples.  The circumstances
of this first meeting of their Imperial Majesties are well known.

In the little village of Courcelles, the Emperor met the last courier, who preceded by only
a few moments the carriages of the Empress; and as it was raining in torrents, his Majesty
took shelter on the porch of the village church.  As the carriage of the Empress was passing,
the Emperor made signs to the postilions to stop; and the equerry, who was at the Empress's
door, perceiving the Emperor, hastily lowered the step, and announced his Majesty, who, somewhat
vexed by this, exclaimed, "Could you not see that I made signs to you to be silent?"  This
slight ill-humor, however, passed away in an instant; and the Emperor threw himself on the
neck of Marie Louise, who, holding in her hand the picture of her husband, and looking attentively
first at it, then at him, remarked with a charming smile, "It is not flattered."  A magnificent
supper had been prepared at Soissons for the Empress and her cortege; but the Emperor gave
orders to pass on, and drove as far as Compiegne, without regard to the appetites of the officers
and ladies in the suite of the Empress.

CHAPTER XXVI.

On their Majesties' arrival at Compiegne, the Emperor presented his hand to the Empress, and
conducted her to her apartment.  He wished that no one should approach or touch his young wife
before himself; and his jealousy was so extreme on this point that he himself forbade the senator
de Beauharnais, the Empress's chevalier of honor, to present his hand to her Imperial Majesty,
although this was one of the requirements of his position.  According to the programme, the
Emperor should have occupied a different residence from the Empress, and have slept at the
hotel of the Chancellerie; but he did nothing of the sort, since after a long conversation
with the Empress, he returned to his room, undressed, perfumed himself with cologne, and wearing
only a nightdress returned secretly to the Empress.

The next morning the Emperor asked me at his toilet if any one noticed the change he had made
in the programme; and I replied that I thought not, though at the risk of falsehood.  Just
then one of his Majesty's intimate friends entered who was unmarried, to whom his Majesty,
pulling his ears, said, "My dear fellow, marry a German.  They are the best wives in the world;
gentle, good, artless, and fresh as roses."  From the air of satisfaction with which the Emperor
said this, it was easy to see that he was painting a portrait, and it was only a short while
since the painter had left the model.  After making his toilet, the Emperor returned to the
Empress, and towards noon had breakfast sent up for her and him, and served near the bed by
her Majesty's women.  Throughout the day he was in a state of charming gayety, and contrary
to his usual custom, having made a second toilet for dinner, wore the coat made by the tailor
of the King of Naples; but next day he would not allow it to be put on again, saying it was
much too uncomfortable.

The Emperor, as may be seen from the preceding details, loved his new wife most tenderly. 
He paid her constant attentions, and his whole conduct was that of a lover deeply enamoured.
Nevertheless, it is not true, as some one has said, that he remained three months almost without
working, to the great astonishment of his ministers; for work was not only a duty with the
Emperor, it was both a necessity and an enjoyment, from which no other pleasure, however great,
could distract him; and on this occasion, as on every other, he knew perfectly well how to
combine the duties he owed to his empire and his army with those due to his charming wife.

The Empress Marie Louise was only nineteen years old at the period of her marriage.  Her hair
was blond, her eyes blue and expressive, her carriage noble, and her figure striking, while
her hand and foot might have served as models; in fact, her whole person breathed youth, health,
and freshness.  She was diffident, and maintained a haughty reserve towards the court; but
she was said to be affectionate and friendly in private life, and one fact I can assert positively
is that she was very affectionate toward the Emperor, and submissive to his will.  In their
first interview the Emperor asked her what recommendations were made to her on her departure
from Vienna.  "To be entirely devoted to you, and to obey you in all things," which instructions
she seemed to find no difficulty in obeying.

No one could resemble the first Empress less than the second, and except in the two points
of similarity of temperament, and an extreme regard for the Emperor, the one was exactly the
opposite of the other; and it must be confessed the Emperor congratulated himself on this difference,
in which he found both novelty and charm.  He himself drew a parallel between his two wives
in these terms:  "The one [Josephine] was all art and grace; the other [Marie Louise] innocence
and natural simplicity.  At no moment of her life were the manners or habits of the former
other than agreeable and attractive, and it would have been impossible to take her at a disadvantage
on these points; for it was her special object in life to produce only advantageous impressions,
and she gained her end without allowing this effort to be seen.  All that art can furnish to
supplement attractions was practiced by her, but so skillfully that the existence of this deception
could only be suspected at most.  On the contrary, it never occurred to the mind of the second
that she could gain anything by innocent artifices.  The one was always tempted to infringe
upon the truth, and her first emotion was a negative one.  The other was ignorant of dissimulation,
and every deception was foreign to her.  The first never asked for anything, but she owed everywhere.
The second did not hesitate to ask if she needed anything, which was very rarely, and never
purchased anything without feeling herself obliged to pay for it immediately.  To sum it all
up, both were good, gentle wives, and much attached to their husband."  Such, or very nearly
these, were the terms in which the Emperor spoke of his Empresses.  It can be seen that he
drew the comparison in favor of the second; and with this idea he gave her credit for qualities
which she did not possess, or at least exaggerated greatly those really belonging to her.

The Emperor granted Marie Louise 500,000 francs for her toilet, but she never spent the entire
amount.  She had little taste in dress, and would have made a very inelegant appearance had
she not been well advised. The Emperor was present at her toilet those days on which he wished
her to appear especially well, and himself tried the effect of different ornaments on the head,
neck, and arms of the Empress, always selecting something very handsome.  The Emperor was an
excellent husband, of which he gave proof in the case of both his wives.  He adored his son,
and both as father and husband might have served as a model for all his subjects; yet in spite
of whatever he may have said on the subject himself, I do not think he loved Marie Louise with
the same devoted affection as Josephine.  The latter had a charming grace, a kindness, an intelligence,
and a devotion to her husband which the Emperor knew and appreciated at its full value; and
though Marie Louise was younger, she was colder, and had far less grace of manner.  I think
she was much attached to her husband; but she was reserved and reticent, and by no means took
the place of Josephine with those who had enjoyed the happiness of being near the latter.

Notwithstanding the apparent submission with which she had bidden farewell to her Austrian
household, it is certain that she had strong prejudices, not only against her own household,
but also against that of the Emperor, and never addressed a gracious word to the persons in
the Emperor's personal service.  I saw her frequently, but not a smile, a look, a sign, on
the part of the Empress showed me that I was in her eyes anything more than a stranger.  On
my return from Russia, whence I did not arrive until after the Emperor, I lost no time in entering
his room, knowing that he had already asked for me, and found there his Majesty with the Empress
and Queen Hortense.  The Emperor condoled with me on the sufferings I had recently undergone,
and said many flattering things which proved his high opinion of me; and the queen, with that
charming grace of which she is the only model since the death of her august mother, conversed
with me for some time in the kindest manner.  The Empress alone kept silence; and noticing
this the Emperor said to her, "Louise, have you nothing to say to poor Constant?"--"I had not
perceived him," said the Empress.  This reply was most unkind, as it was impossible for her
Majesty not to have "perceived" me, there being at that moment present in the room only the
Emperor, Queen Hortense, and I.

The Emperor from the first took the severest precautions that no one, and especially no man,
should approach the Empress, except in the presence of witnesses.

bob.  The ladies of
the private apartments were required to observe these rules, and were responsible for their
execution; and one of them was required to be present at the music, painting, and embroidery
lessons of the Empress, and wrote letters by her dictation or under her orders.

The Emperor did not wish that any man in the world should boast of having been alone with the
Empress for two minutes; and he reprimanded very severely the lady on duty because she one
day remained at the end of the saloon while M. Biennais, court watchmaker, showed her Majesty
a secret drawer in a portfolio he had made for her.  Another time the Emperor was much displeased
because the lady on duty was not seated by the side of the Empress while she took her music-lesson
with M. Pier.

These facts prove conclusively the falsity of the statement that the milliner Leroy was excluded
from the palace for taking the liberty of saying to her Majesty that she had beautiful shoulders.
M. Leroy had the dresses of the Empress made at his shop by a model which was sent him; and
they were never tried on her Majesty, either by him, or any person of her Majesty's household,
and necessary alterations were indicated by her femmes de chambre.  It was the same with the
other merchants and furnishers, makers of corsets, the shoemaker, glovemaker, etc.; not one
of whom ever saw the Empress or spoke to her in her private apartments.
