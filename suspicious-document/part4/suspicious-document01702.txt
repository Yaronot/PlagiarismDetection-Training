Fate, however, of which lovers make so many complaints, was in this case unfavourable to Charles
Hazlewood. His horse's shoes required an alteration, in consequence of the fresh weather having
decidedly commenced. The lady of the house where he was a visitor chose to indulge in her own
room till a very late breakfast hour. His friend also insisted on showing him a litter of puppies
which his favourite pointer bitch had produced that morning. The colours had occasioned some
doubts about the paternity--a weighty question of legitimacy, to the decision of which Hazlewood's
opinion was called in as arbiter between his friend and his groom, and which inferred in its
consequences which of the litter should be drowned, which saved. Besides, the Laird himself
delayed our young lover's departure for a considerable time, endeavouring, with long and superfluous
rhetoric, to insinuate to Sir Robert Hazlewood, through the medium of his son, his own particular
ideas respecting the line of a meditated turnpike road. It is greatly to the shame of our young
lover's apprehension that, after the tenth reiterated account of the matter, he could not see
the advantage to be obtained by the proposed road passing over the Lang Hirst, Windy Knowe,
the Goodhouse Park, Hailziecroft, and then crossing the river at Simon's Pool, and so by the
road to Kippletringan; and the less eligible line pointed out by the English surveyor, which
would go clear through the main enclosures at Hazlewood, and cut within a mile or nearly so
of the house itself, destroying the privacy and pleasure, as his informer contended, of the
grounds. In short, the adviser (whose actual interest was to have the bridge built as near
as possible to a farm of his own) failed in every effort to attract young Hazlewood's attention
until he mentioned by chance that the proposed line was favoured by 'that fellow Glossin,'
who pretended to take a lead in the county. On a sudden young Hazlewood became attentive and
interested; and, having satisfied himself which was the line that Glossin patronised, assured
his friend it should not be his fault if his father did not countenance any other instead of
that. But these various interruptions consumed the morning. Hazlewood got on horseback at least
three hours later than he intended, and, cursing fine ladies, pointers, puppies, and turnpike
acts of parliament, saw himself detained beyond the time when he could with propriety intrude
upon the family at Woodbourne.

He had passed, therefore, the turn of the road which led to that mansion, only edified by the
distant appearance of the blue smoke curling against the pale sky of the winter evening, when
he thought he beheld the Dominie taking a footpath for the house through the woods. He called
after him, but in vain; for that honest gentleman, never the most susceptible of extraneous
impressions, had just that moment parted from Meg Merrilies, and was too deeply wrapt up in
pondering upon her vaticinations to make any answer to Hazlewood's call. He was therefore obliged
to let him proceed without inquiry after the health of the young ladies, or any other fishing
question, to which he might by good chance have had an answer returned wherein Miss Bertram's
name might have been mentioned. All cause for haste was now over, and, slackening the reins
upon his horse's neck, he permitted the animal to ascend at his own leisure the steep sandy
track between two high banks, which, rising to a considerable height, commanded at length an
extensive view of the neighbouring country.

Hazlewood was, however, so far from eagerly looking forward to this prospect, though it had
the recommendation that great part of the land was his father's, and must necessarily be his
own, that his head still turned backward towards the chimneys of Woodbourne, although at every
step his horse made the difficulty of employing his eyes in that direction become greater.
From the reverie in which he was sunk he was suddenly roused by a voice, too harsh to be called
female, yet too shrill for a man: 'What's kept you on the road sae lang? Maun ither folk do
your wark?'

He looked up. The spokeswoman was very tall, had a voluminous handkerchief rolled round her
head, grizzled hair flowing in elf- locks from beneath it, a long red cloak, and a staff in
her hand, headed with a sort of spear-point; it was, in short, Meg Merrilies. Hazlewood had
never seen this remarkable figure before; he drew up his reins in astonishment at her appearance,
and made a full stop. 'I think,' continued she, 'they that hae taen interest in the house of
Ellangowan suld sleep nane this night; three men hae been seeking ye, and you are gaun hame
to sleep in your bed. D' ye think if the lad-bairn fa's, the sister will do weel? Na, na!'

'I don't understand you, good woman,' said Hazlewood. 'If you speak of Miss---, I mean of any
of the late Ellangowan family, tell me what I can do for them.'

'Of the late Ellangowan family?' she answered with great vehemence--'of the LATE Ellangowan
family! and when was there ever, or when will there ever be, a family of Ellangowan but bearing
the gallant name of the bauld Bertrams?'

'But what do you mean, good woman?'

'I am nae good woman; a' the country kens I am bad eneugh, and baith they and I may be sorry
eneugh that I am nae better. But I can do what good women canna, and daurna do. I can do what
would freeze the blood o' them that is bred in biggit wa's for naething but to bind bairns'
heads and to hap them in the cradle. Hear me: the guard's drawn off at the custom-house at
Portanferry, and it's brought up to Hazlewood House by your father's orders, because he thinks
his house is to be attacked this night by the smugglers. There's naebody means to touch his
house; he has gude blood and gentle blood--I say little o' him for himsell--but there's naebody
thinks him worth meddling wi'. Send the horsemen back to their post, cannily and quietly; see
an they winna hae wark the night, ay will they: the guns will flash and the swords will glitter
in the braw moon.'

'Good God! what do you mean?' said young Hazlewood; 'your words and manner would persuade me
you are mad, and yet there is a strange combination in what you say.'

'I am not mad!' exclaimed the gipsy; 'I have been imprisoned for mad--scourged for mad--banished
for mad--but mad I am not. Hear ye, Charles Hazlewood of Hazlewood: d'ye bear malice against
him that wounded you?'

'No, dame, God forbid; my arm is quite well, and I have always said the shot was discharged
by accident. I should be glad to tell the young man so himself.'

'Then do what I bid ye,' answered Meg Merrilies, 'and ye'll do him mair gude than ever he did
you ill; for if he was left to his ill-wishers he would be a bloody corpse ere morn, or a banished
man; but there's Ane abune a'. Do as I bid you; send back the soldiers to Portanferry. There's
nae mair fear o' Hazlewood House than there's o' Cruffel Fell.' And she vanished with her usual
celerity of pace.

It would seem that the appearance of this female, and the mixture of frenzy and enthusiasm
in her manner, seldom failed to produce the strongest impression upon those whom she addressed.
Her words, though wild, were too plain and intelligible for actual madness, and yet too vehement
and extravagant for sober-minded communication. She seemed acting under the influence of an
imagination rather strongly excited than deranged; and it is wonderful how palpably the difference
in such cases is impressed upon the mind of the auditor. This may account for the attention
with which her strange and mysterious hints were heard and acted upon. It is certain, at least,
that young Hazlewood was strongly impressed by her sudden appearance and imperative tone. He
rode to Hazlewood at a brisk pace. It had been dark for some time before he reached the house,
and on his arrival there he saw a confirmation of what the sibyl had hinted.

Thirty dragoon horses stood under a shed near the offices, with their bridles linked together.
Three or four soldiers attended as a guard, while others stamped up and down with their long
broadswords and heavy boots in front of the house. Hazlewood asked a non-commissioned officer
from whence they came.

'From Portanferry.'

'Had they left any guard there?'

'No; they had been drawn off by order of Sir Robert Hazlewood for defence of his house against
an attack which was threatened by the smugglers.'

Charles Hazlewood instantly went in quest of his father, and, having paid his respects to him
upon his return, requested to know upon what account he had thought it necessary to send for
a military escort. Sir Robert assured his son in reply that, from the information, intelligence,
and tidings which had been communicated to, and laid before him, he had the deepest reason
to believe, credit, and be convinced that a riotous assault would that night be attempted and
perpetrated against Hazlewood House by a set of smugglers, gipsies, and other desperadoes.

'And what, my dear sir,' said his son, 'should direct the fury of such persons against ours
rather than any other house in the country?'

'I should rather think, suppose, and be of opinion, sir,' answered Sir Robert, 'with deference
to your wisdom and experience, that on these occasions and times the vengeance of such persons
is directed or levelled against the most important and distinguished in point of rank, talent,
birth, and situation who have checked, interfered with, and discountenanced their unlawful
and illegal and criminal actions or deeds.'

Young Hazlewood, who knew his father's foible, answered, that the cause of his surprise did
not lie where Sir Robert apprehended, but that he only wondered they should think of attacking
a house where there were so many servants, and where a signal to the neighbouring tenants could
call in such strong assistance; and added, that he doubted much whether the reputation of the
family would not in some degree suffer from calling soldiers from their duty at the custom-house
to protect them, as if they were not sufficiently strong to defend themselves upon any ordinary
occasion. He even hinted that, in case their house's enemies should observe that this precaution
had been taken unnecessarily, there would be no end of their sarcasms.

Sir Robert Hazlewood was rather puzzled at this intimation, for, like most dull men, he heartily
hated and feared ridicule. He gathered himself up and looked with a sort of pompous embarrassment,
as if he wished to be thought to despise the opinion of the public, which in reality he dreaded.

'I really should have thought,' he said, 'that the injury which had already been aimed at my
house in your person, being the next heir and representative of the Hazlewood family, failing
me--I should have thought and believed, I say, that this would have justified me sufficiently
in the eyes of the most respectable and the greater part of the people for taking such precautions
as are calculated to prevent and impede a repetition of outrage.'

'Really, sir,' said Charles, 'I must remind you of what I have often said before, that I am
positive the discharge of the piece was accidental.'

'Sir, it was not accidental,' said his father, angrily; 'but you will be wiser than your elders.'

'Really, sir,' replied Hazlewood, 'in what so intimately concerns myself---'

'Sir, it does not concern you but in a very secondary degree; that is, it does not concern
you, as a giddy young fellow who takes pleasure in contradicting his father; but it concerns
the country, sir, and the county, sir, and the public, sir, and the kingdom of Scotland, in
so far as the interest of the Hazlewood family, sir, is committed and interested and put in
peril, in, by, and through you, sir. And the fellow is in safe custody, and Mr. Glossin thinks---'

'Mr. Glossin, sir?'

'Yes, sir, the gentleman who has purchased Ellangowan; you know who I mean, I suppose?'

'Yes, sir,' answered the young man; 'but I should hardly have expected to hear you quote such

 I think, sir, and believe, sir, and am of opinion, sir, that if any one of these family
pictures were deranged or destroyed or injured it would be difficult for me to make up the
loss upon the guarantee which you so obligingly offer me.'

'In that case I shall be sorry for it, Sir Robert,' answered the downright Mac-Morlan; 'but
I presume I may escape the pain of feeling my conduct the cause of such irreparable loss, as
I can assure you there will be no attempt upon Hazlewood House whatever, and I have received
information which induces me to suspect that the rumour was put afloat merely in order to occasion
the removal of the soldiers from Portanferry. And under this strong belief and conviction I
must exert my authority as sheriff and chief magistrate of police to order the whole, or greater
part of them, back again. I regret much that by my accidental absence a good deal of delay
has already taken place, and we shall not now reach Portanferry until it is late.'

As Mr. Mac-Morlan was the superior magistrate, and expressed himself peremptory in the purpose
of acting as such, the Baronet, though highly offended, could only say, 'Very well, sir; it
is very well. Nay, sir, take them all with you; I am far from desiring any to be left here,
sir. We, sir, can protect ourselves, sir. But you will have the goodness to observe, sir, that
you are acting on your own proper risk, sir, and peril, sir, and responsibility, sir, if anything
shall happen or befall to Hazlewood House, sir, or the inhabitants, sir, or to the furniture
and paintings, sir.'

'I am acting to the best of my judgment and information, Sir Robert,' said Mac-Morlan, 'and
I must pray of you to believe so, and to pardon me accordingly. I beg you to observe it is
no time for ceremony; it is already very late.'

But Sir Robert, without deigning to listen to his apologies, immediately employed himself with
much parade in arming and arraying his domestics. Charles Hazlewood longed to accompany the
military, which were about to depart for Portanferry, and which were now drawn up and mounted
by direction and under the guidance of Mr. Mac-Morlan, as the civil magistrate. Kongfuze-foo-too,

CHAPTER XLVIII

     Wi' coulters and wi' forehammers
     We garr'd the bars bang merrily,
     Until we came to the inner prison,
     Where Willie o' Kinmont he did lie.

          Old Border Ballad.

We return to Portanferry, and to Bertram and his honest-hearted friend, whom we left most innocent
inhabitants of a place built for the guilty. The slumbers of the farmer were as sound as it
was possible.

But Bertram's first heavy sleep passed away long before midnight, nor could he again recover
that state of oblivion. Added to the uncertain and uncomfortable state of his mind, his body
felt feverish and oppressed. This was chiefly owing to the close and confined air of the small
apartment in which they slept. After enduring for some time the broiling and suffocating feeling
attendant upon such an atmosphere, he rose to endeavour to open the window of the apartment,
and thus to procure a change of air. Alas! the first trial reminded him that he was in jail,
and that the building being contrived for security, not comfort, the means of procuring fresh
air were not left at the disposal of the wretched inhabitants.
