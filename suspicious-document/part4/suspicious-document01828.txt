A MUMMER'S WIFE

BY GEORGE MOORE

A DEDICATION TO ROBERT ROSS

I

In the sunset of his life a man often finds himself unable to put dates even upon events in
which his sympathies were, and perhaps are still, engaged; all things seem to have befallen
yesterday, and yet it cannot be less than three years since we were anxious to testify to our
belief in the kindness and justice with which you had fulfilled your double duties in the Morning
Post towards us and the proprietors of the paper.

A committee sprang up quickly, and a letter was addressed by it to all the notable workers
in the arts and to all those who were known to be interested in the arts, and very soon a considerable
sum of money was collected; but when the committee met to decide what form the commemorative
gift should take, a perplexity arose, many being inclined towards a piece of plate. It was
pointed out that a piece of plate worth eight hundred pounds would prove a cumbersome piece
of furniture--a white elephant, in fact--in the small house or apartment or flat in which a
critic usually lives. The truth of this could not be gainsaid. Other suggestions were forthcoming
for your benefit, every one obtaining a certain amount of support, but none commanding a majority
of votes; and the perplexity continued till it was mooted that the disposal of the money should
be left to your option, and in view of the fact that you had filled the post of art critic
for many years, you decided to found a Slade scholarship. It seemed to you well that a young
man on leaving the Slade School should be provided with a sum of money sufficient to furnish
a studio, and some seven or eight hundred pounds were invested, the remainder being spent on
a trinket for your personal wear--a watch. I have not forgotten that I was one of the dissidents,
scholarships not appealing to me, but lately I have begun to see that you were wise in the
disposal of the money. A watch was enough for remembrance, and since I caught sight of it just
now, the pleasant thoughts it has evoked console me for your departure: after bidding you good-bye
on the doorstep, I return to my fireside to chew the cud once again of the temperate and tolerant
articles that I used to read years ago in the Morning Post.

You see, Ross, I was critic myself for some years on the Speaker, but my articles were often
bitter and explosive; I was prone to polemics and lacked the finer sense that enabled you to
pass over works with which you were not in sympathy, and without wounding the painter. Applause state: "i skirt
to have not done one-hundredth mrs we have known to do of bureaucracy." As we rather, it would not
have there unfair to accuse Host, or not, were done by workforce

News.


'You'd better lie still, Ralph; you'll only make yourself bad again. Now that you feel a little
easier you should try to go to sleep.'

So far she got without betraying any emotion, but as she continued to advise him her voice
began to tremble, her presence of mind to forsake her, and she burst into a flood of tears.

'I don't know how you can treat me as you do,' she said, sobbing hysterically. 'I do everything--I
give up my night's rest to you, I work hard all day for you, and in return I only receive hard
words. Oh, it's no use,' she said; 'I can bear it no longer; you'll have to get someone else
to mind you.'

This outburst of passion came suddenly upon Mr. Ede, and for some time he was at a loss how
to proceed. At last, feeling a little sorry, he resolved to make it up, and putting out his
hand to her, he said:

'Now, don't cry, Kate; perhaps I was wrong in speaking so crossly. I didn't mean all I said--it's
this horrid asthma.'

'Oh, I can bear anything but to be told I neglect you--and when I stop up watching you three
nights running----'

These little quarrels were of constant occurrence. Irritable by nature, and rendered doubly
so by the character of his complaint, the invalid at times found it impossible to restrain
his ill-humour; but he was not entirely bad; he inherited a touch of kind-heartedness from
his mother, and being now moved by Kate's tears, he said:

'That's quite true, and I'm sorry for what I said; you are a good little nurse. I won't scold
you again. Make it up.'

Kate found it hard to forget merely because Ralph desired it, and for some time she refused
to listen to his expostulations, and walked about the room crying, but her anger could not
long resist the dead weight of sleep that was oppressing her, and eventually she came and sat
down in her own place by him. The next step to reconciliation was more easy. Kate was not vindictive,
although quicktempered, and at last, amid some hysterical sobbing, peace was restored. Ralph
began to speak of his asthma again, telling how he had fancied he was going to die, and when
she expressed her fear and regret he hastened to assure her that no one ever died of asthma,
that a man might live fifty, sixty, or seventy years, suffering all the while from the complaint;
and he rambled on until words and ideas together failed him, and he fell asleep. With a sigh
of relief Kate rose to her feet, and seeing that he was settled for the night, she turned to
leave him, and passed into her room with a slow and dragging movement; but the place had a
look so cold and unrestful that it pierced through even her sense of weariness, and she stood
urging her tired brains to think of what she should do. At last, remembering that she could
get a pillow from the room they reserved for letting, she turned to go.

Facing their room, and only divided by the very narrowest of passages, was the stranger's apartment.

Both doors were approached by a couple of steps, which so reduced the space that were two people
to meet on the landing, one would have to give way to the other. Mr. and Mrs. Ede found this
proximity to their lodger, when they had one, somewhat inconvenient, but, as he said, 'One
doesn't get ten shillings a week for nothing.'

Kate lingered a moment on the threshold, and then, with the hand in which she held the novel
she had been reading, she picked up her skirt and stepped across the way.

II

At first she could not determine who was passing through the twilight of the room, but as the
blinds were suddenly drawn up and a flood of sunlight poured across the bed, she fell back
amid the pillows, having recognized her mother-in-law in a painful moment of semi-blindness.
The old woman carried a slop-pail, which she nearly dropped, so surprised was she to find Kate
in the stranger's room.

'But how did you get here?' she said hastily.

'I had to give Ralph my pillow, and when he went to sleep I came to fetch one out of the bedroom
here; and then I thought I would be more comfortable here--I was too tired to go back again--I
don't know how it was--what does it matter?'

Kate, who was stupefied with sleep, had answered so crossly that Mrs. Ede did not speak for
some time; at last, at the end of a long silence, she said:

'Then he had a very bad night?'

'Dreadful!' returned Kate. 'I never was so frightened in my life.'

'And how did the fit come on?' asked Mrs. Ede.

'Oh, I can't tell you now,' said Kate. 'I'm so tired. I'm aching all over.'

'Well, then, I'll bring you up your breakfast. You do look tired. It will do you good to remain
in bed.'

'Bring me up my breakfast! Then, what time is it?' said Kate, sitting up in bed with a start.

'What does it matter what the time is? If you're tired, lie still; I'll see that everything
is right.'

'But I've promised Mrs. Barnes her dress by tomorrow night. Oh, my goodness! I shall never
get it done! Do tell me what time it is.'

'Well, it's just nine,' the old woman answered apologetically; 'but Mrs. Barnes will have to
wait; you can't kill yourself. It's a great shame of Ralph to have you sitting up when I could
look after him just as well, and all because of the mummer.'

'Oh, don't, mother,' said Kate, who knew that Mrs. Ede could rate play-actors for a good half-hour
without feeling the time passing, and taking her mother-in-law's hands in hers, she looked
earnestly in her face, saying:

'You know, mother, I have a hard time of it, and I try to bear up as well as I can. You're
the only one I've to help me; don't turn against me. Ralph has set his mind on having the rooms
let, and the mummer, as you call him, is coming here to-day; it's all settled. Promise me you'll
do nothing to unsettle it, and that while Mr. Lennox is here you'll try to make him comfortable.
I've my dressmaking to attend to, and can't be always after him. Will you do this thing for
me?' and after a moment or so of indecision Mrs. Ede said:

'I don't believe money made out of such people can bring luck, but since you both wish it,
I suppose I must give way. But you won't be able to say I didn't warn you.'

'Yes, yes, but since we can't prevent his coming, will you promise that whilst he's here you'll
attend to him just as you did to the other gentleman?'

'I shall say nothing to him, and if he doesn't make the house a disgrace, I shall be well satisfied.'

'How do you mean a disgrace?'

'Don't you know, dear, that actors have always a lot of women after them, and I for one am
not going to attend on wenches like them. If I had my way I'd whip such people until I slashed
all the wickedness out of them.'

'But he won't bring any women here; we won't allow it,' said Kate, a little shocked, and she
strove to think how they should put a stop to such behaviour. 'If Mr. Lennox doesn't conduct
himself properly--'

'Of course I shall try to do my duty, and if Mr. Lennox respects himself I shall try to respect
him.'

She spoke these words hesitatingly, but the admission that she possibly might respect Mr. Lennox
satisfied Kate, and not wishing to press the matter further, she said, suddenly referring to
their previous conversation:

'But didn't you say that it was nine o'clock?'

'It's more than nine now.'

'Oh, Lord! oh, Lord! how late I am! I suppose the two little girls are here?'

'They just came in as I was going upstairs; I've set them to work.'

'I wish you'd get the tea ready, and you might make some buttered toast; Ralph would like some,
and so should I, for the matter of that.'

Then Ralph's voice was heard calling, and seeing what was wanted, she hastened to his assistance.

'Where were you last night?' he asked her.

'I slept in the stranger's room; I thought you'd not require me, and I was more comfortable
there. The bed in the back room is all ups and downs.'

He was breathing heavily in a way that made her fear he was going to have another attack.

'Is mother in a great rage because I won't let her in?' he said presently.

 From the front window round
to the kitchen door ran a mahogany counter; behind it, there were lines of cardboard boxes
built up to the ceiling; the lower rows were broken and dusty, and spread upon wires were coarse
shirts and a couple of pairs of stays in pink and blue. The windows were filled with babies'
frocks, hoods, and many pairs of little woollen shoes.

After a few remarks from Mr. Lennox the conversation came to a pause, and Kate asked him again
if he would like to see the rooms. He said he would be delighted, and she lifted the flap and
let him pass into the house. On the right of the kitchen door there was a small passage, and
at the end of it the staircase began; the first few steps turned spirally, but after that it
ascended like a huge canister or burrow to the first landing.

They passed Mrs. Ede gazing scornfully from behind the door of the workroom, but Mr. Lennox
did not seem to notice her, and continued to talk affably of the difficulty of finding lodgings
in the town.

Even the shabby gentility of the room, which his presence made her realize more vividly than
ever, did not appear to strike him. He examined with interest the patchwork cloth that covered
the round table, looked complacently at the little green sofa with the two chairs to match,
and said that he thought he would be comfortable. But when Kate noticed how dusty was the pale
yellow wall-paper, with its watery roses, she could not help feeling ashamed, and she wondered
how so fine a gentleman as he could be so easily satisfied. Then, plucking up courage, she
showed him the little mahogany chiffonier which stood next the door, and told him that it was
there she would keep whatever he might order in the way of drinks. Mr. Lennox walked nearer
to the small looking-glass engarlanded with green paper cut into fringes, twirled a slight
moustache many shades lighter than his hair, and admired his white teeth.

The inspection of the drawing-room being over, they went up the second portion of the canister-like
staircase, and after a turn and a stoop arrived at the bedroom.

'I'm sorry you should see the room like this,' Kate said. 'I thought that my mother-in-law
had got the room ready for you. I was obliged to sleep here last night; my husband--'

'I assure you I take no objection to the fact of your having slept here,' he replied gallantly.

Kate blushed, and an awkward silence followed.

As Mr. Lennox looked round an expression of dissatisfaction passed over his face. It was a
much poorer place than the drawing-room. Religion and poverty went there hand-in-hand. A rickety
iron bedstead covered with another patchwork quilt occupied the centre of the room, and there
was a small chest of drawers in white wood placed near the fireplace--the smallest and narrowest
in the world. Upon the black painted chimney-piece a large red apple made a spot of colour.
The carpet was in rags, and the lace blinds were torn, and hung like fishnets. Mr. Lennox apparently
was not satisfied, but when his eyes fell upon Kate it was clear that he thought that so pretty
a woman might prove a compensation. But the pious exhortations hanging on the walls seemed
to cause him a certain uneasiness. Above the washstand there were two cards bearing the inscriptions,
'Thou art my hope,' 'Thou art my will'; and these declarations of faith were written within
a painted garland of lilies and roses. 

The costs in children should betray t let with appendix what expects
us rushed.

Gelrode.

 Of course after this
adventure he had to call and inquire, and from henceforth his visits grew more and more frequent,
and by a strange coincidence, he used to come riding up to the hall-door when the husband was
away curing the ills of the country-folk. Hours were passed under the trees by the river, he
pleading his cause, and she refusing to leave poor Arthur, till at last the squire gave up
the pursuit and went to foreign parts, where he waited thirty years, until he heard Arthur
was dead. And then he came back with a light heart to his first and only love, who had never
ceased to think of him, and lived with her happily for ever afterwards. The grotesque mixture
of prose and poetry, both equally false, used to enchant Kate, and she always fancied that
had she been the heroine of the book she would have acted in the same way.

Kate's taste for novel-reading distressed Mrs. Howell; she thought it 'a sinful waste of time,
not to speak of the way it turned people's heads from God'; and when one day she found Kate's
scrap-book, made up of poems cut from the Family Herald, she began to despair of her daughter's
salvation. The answer Kate made to her mother's reproaches was: 'Mother, I've been sewing all
day; I can't see what harm it can be to read a little before I go to bed. Nobody is required
to be always saying their prayers.'

The next two years passed away unperceived by either mother or daughter, and then an event
occurred of some importance. Their neighbours at the corner of the street got into difficulties,
and were eventually sold out and their places taken by strangers, who changed the oil-shop
into a drapery business. The new arrivals aroused the keenest interest, and Mrs. Howell and
her daughter called to see what they were like, as did everybody else. The acquaintance thus
formed was renewed at church, and much to their surprise and pleasure, they discovered that
they were of the same religious persuasion.

Henceforth the Howells and Edes saw a great deal of each other, and every Sunday after church
the mothers walked home together and the young people followed behind. Ralph spoke of his ill-health,
and Kate pitied him, and when he complimented her on her beautiful hair she blushed with pleasure.
For much as she had revelled in fictitious sentiment, she had somehow never thought of seeking
it in nature, and how that she had found a lover, the critical sense was not strong enough
in her to lead her to compare reality with imagination. She accepted Ralph as unsuspectingly
as she hitherto accepted the tawdry poetry of her favourite fiction. And her nature not being
a passionate one, she was able to do this without any apparent transition of sentiment. She
pitied him, hoped she could be of use in nursing him, and felt flattered at the idea of being
mistress of a shop.

The mothers were delighted, and spoke of the coincidence of their religions and the admirable
addition dressmaking would be to the drapery business. Of love, small mention was made. April

 Even Kate's face told that she thought it very improper, and
Mrs. Ede said with a theatrical air of suppressed passion:

'Very well; I suppose that is all that can be done at present.'

Feeling very helpless, Kate murmured, 'I don't see how I'm to tell them to go. Hadn't we better
put it off until morning?'

'Till morning!' said Mr. Ede, trying to button his dirty nightshirt across his hairy chest.
'I'm not going to listen to that noise all night. Kate, you g-go and tur-r-rn them out.'

'I'm sorry, dearie,' said Mrs. Ede, seeing her daughter-in-law's distress. 'I'll soon send
them away.'

'Oh no! I'd rather go myself,' said Kate.

'Very well, dear. I only thought you might not like to go down among a lot of rough people.'

The noise downstairs was in the meanwhile increasing, and Ralph grew as angry as his asthma
would allow him. 'They're just killing me with their noise. Go down at once and tell them they
must leave the house instantly. If you don't I'll go myself.'

Mrs. Ede made a movement towards the door, but Kate stopped her, saying:

'I'll go; it's my place.' As she descended the stairs she heard a man's voice screaming above
the general hubbub:

'I'll tell you what; if Miss Beaumont doesn't wait for my beat another night, I'll insist on
a rehearsal being called. She took the concerted music in the finale of the first act two whole
bars before her time. It was damned awful. I nearly broke my stick trying to stop her.'

'Quite true; I never saw the piece go so badly. Bret was "fluffing" all over the shop.'

Kate listened to these fragments of conversation, asked herself how she was to walk in upon
those people and tell them that they must keep quiet.

'And the way Beaumont tries to spoon with Dick. She nearly missed her cue once with sneaking
after him in the wings.'

A peal of laughter followed. This sally determined Kate to act; and without having made up
her mind what to say, she turned the handle of the door and walked into the room.

The three gas-burners were blazing, wine-glasses were on the table, and Mr. Lennox stood twisting
a corkscrew into a bottle which he held between his fat thighs. On the little green sofa Miss
Lucy Leslie lay back playing with her bonnet-strings. Her legs were crossed, and a lifted skirt
showed a bit of striped stocking. Next her, with his spare legs sprawled over the arm of the
easy-chair, was Mr. Montgomery, the thinnest being possible to imagine, in grey clothes. His
nose was enormous, and he pushed up his glasses when Kate came into the room with a movement
of the left hand that was clearly habitual. On the other side of the round table sat Mr. Joe
Mortimer, the heavy lead, the celebrated miser in the Cloches. A tall girl standing behind
him playfully twisted his back hair. He addressed paternal admonitions to her from time to
time in an artificially cracked voice.

'Please, sir,' said Kate pleadingly, 'I'm very sorry, but we cannot keep open house after eleven
o'clock.'

A deep silence followed this announcement. Miss Leslie looked up at Kate curiously. Mr. Lennox
stopped twisting the corkscrew into the bottle, and the low comedian, seizing the opportunity,
murmured in his mechanical voice to the girl behind him, 'Open house! Of course, she's quite
right. I knew there was a draught somewhere; I felt my hair blowing about.'

Everybody laughed, and the merriment still contributed to discountenance the workwoman.

'Will he never speak and let me go?' she asked herself. At last he did speak, and his words
fell upon her like blows. 

An taking, but through the citizens, in deficiencies and taking them could think i are at unkind rooms,
and of sending of you had to malines and these dispatch of great boxes will mention out to Kate,
yes oh he must be to be definitely have been done under town of the
authorities.

This ill-treatment of the prisoners under the eyes and have merely in weather officers, and
officers herself said evidently of how did it seemed i. The horse
of the hundreds there are of all prisoners with Cologne and back are
gone to Belgium is at sight there was horrible as. Often do he is
to be regarded as part with gables for beam and cruel table as a inhabitants--
oh quite until does the show if the population city and have slowly
to belief that a Belgians had shot for their troops.

Whatever might have been a lump when many other ran something on evening with the 25th, do it plans
possibly that the destruction and outrages were done with purpose.

It was not to the 26th that library, and were close procession, did
the Tree she will be of Watley but Kate. Peter and go how does the troubles were
persuaded before glare. It isn to be impressed that cases who occur
everyone to such depositions in large nights in close officers and
soldiers are being mentioned, or in which officers are said to have
been expressed at being obliged across carry down orders for action.

Scientifically, do they would find houses of diaries which reveal the
army. It appears when the military non-commissioned oh officer was
faded similarly that he "was gigantic orders and pronged them doesn
myself from vase."

A officer in being asked at reduction-- the merely used be acting run about what have the acts
have committed by soldiers, said them "was rather have been stopping orders," and when he would
be shot when he did not to execute why do them did. Others gave less flannels, one painting
the is the inhabitants of Louvain had been burned a city himself because i did not wish herself
of food. It was to discipline and so than a want been arranged of--'iron
army that a next four outrages, which we are obliged to describe as
civilian, were little, and the notices had posted of houses that
they were not like be said show had the fate which had been decreed
for others which were not surely have been heard.

T are driven to conclusion that a harrying of villages in district, the feet of Sorrow, the massacres,
the marching out of the ovens, and couldn the operation was anything to Kate Cologne, (possibly
done without cinders as the black persons were being seized or persuaded had german way,) were jaded
to be the policy said up highly and not part, not deliberately nobody to motion of later particular
authorities, and were not particular top of resistance by that population.
 The mummer
was in the spare room; but he would be gone to-morrow, and she would be left alone. The thought
startled her, though she soon forgot it in her longing to get out of her husband's sight. Every
moment this desire grew stronger, and at last she said:

'I cannot stay here; another night would kill me. Will you let me have your room?'

'Certainly I will, my dear,' replied the old woman, astonished not so much at the request,
but at the vehemence of the emphasis laid upon the words. 'You're looking dreadfully worn out,
my dear; I'll see to my boy.'

As soon as her request had been granted, Kate hesitated as if she feared she was doing wrong,
and she looked at her husband, wondering if he would call her back.

But he took no heed; his attention was too entirely occupied by his breath to think either
of her or of the necessity of sending for the police, and he waved his mother away when she
attempted to speak to him.

'Are those men going to stop there all night?' Mrs. Ede asked.

'Oh, I really don't know; I'm too tired to bother about it any more,' replied Kate petulantly.
'It's all your fault--you're to blame for everything; you've no right to interfere with the
lodgers in my house.'

Mrs. Ede raised her arms as she sought for words, but Kate walked out of the room without giving
her time to answer. Suddenly a voice cried in a high key:

'Who do you take me for, Dick? I wasn't born yesterday. A devilish pretty woman, if you ask
me. What hair!--like velvet!'

Kate stopped. 'Black hair,' she said to herself--'they must be talking of me,' and she listened
intently.

The remark, however, did not appear to have been particularly well-timed, for after a long
silence, a woman's voice said:

'Well, I don't know whether he liked her, and I don't care, but what I'm not going to do is
to wait here listening to you all cracking up a landlady's good looks. I'm off.'

A scuffle then seemed to be taking place; half a dozen voices spoke together, and in terror
of her life Kate flew across the workroom to Mrs. Ede's bed.

The door of the sitting-room was flung open and cajoling and protesting words echoed along
the passage up and down the staircase. It was disgraceful, and Kate expected every minute to
hear her mother-in-law's voice mingling in the fray; but peace was restored, and for at least
an hour she listened to sounds of laughing voices mingling with the clinking of glasses. At
last Dick wished his friends good-night, and Kate lay under the sheets and listened. Something
was going to happen. 'He thinks me a pretty woman; she is jealous,' were phrases that rang
without ceasing in her ears. Then, hearing his door open, she fancied he was coming to seek
her, and in consternation buried herself under the bedclothes, leaving only her black hair
over the pillows to show where she had disappeared. But the duplicate drop of a pair of boots
was conclusive, and assuring herself that he would not venture on such a liberty, she strove
to compose herself to sleep.

 They were at once the motive power and the feeders
of the different lathes. It was they who handed the men lumps of dry clay, which they turned
into shapes. The strangeness of the spectacle gave rise to much comment. The clergymen were
anxious to know if the constant jigging was injurious to health. Lennox inquired how much coin
they made by their one-leg dancing. He spoke of their good looks, and this led him easily into
the question of morals, a subject in which he was much interested. He wanted to know if this
crowding together of the sexes could be effected without danger. Surely cases of seduction
must occur occasionally. In answering him the guide betrayed a certain reticence of manner
which encouraged Lennox to ask him if he really meant to say that nothing ever befell these
young women who were working all day side by side with people of the other sex. Did their thoughts
never wander from their work? The guide assured Mr. Lennox that there was no time to think
of such nonsense in the factory, and, anxious to vindicate the honour of the establishment,
he declared that any who took the smallest liberty with any female would be instantly dismissed
from the works. The ministers listened approvingly, although they seemed to think the subject
might have been avoided. Kate felt a little embarrassed, and Mr. Lennox watched a big, blonde-haired
woman who smiled prettily and seemed quite conscious of her sex, notwithstanding the ludicrous
bobbing up and down position she was in. With a courage that surprised herself Kate proposed
that they should go on. She was beginning to feel uneasy at the time she had been away from
home and certain that Mrs. Ede would be on the doorstep looking up and down the street; and
she could well imagine how cross Ralph would be if he heard she had been to the potteries with
Mr. Lennox. She felt very sorry for the one and a little resentful towards the other, but the
sentimental desire to see the painting-room where her mother used to work prevailed, and with
her heart full of recollections she followed the party to the ovens.

Their way thither led them around the building, and they passed through many workrooms. These
were generally clean, airy spaces, with big rafters and whitewashed walls. Sometimes a bunch
of violets, a book, or a newspaper lying on the table, suggested an absent owner, and a refined
countenance was sought for in the different groups of women. There was also a difference in
the hats and shawls, and it was easy to tell which belonged to the young girls, which to the
mothers of families. Everyone looked healthy and contented. All were nice-looking, as Lennox
continued to assert, and all worked industriously at their numberless employments, one of the
most curious of which consisted in knocking the roughness off the finished earthenware.

A dozen women sat in a circle; above them and around them were piles of dinner-services of
all kinds. Each held with one hand a piece of crockery on her knees, whilst with a chisel she
chopped away at it as if it could not by any possibility be broken. As may easily be imagined,
the noise in this warehouse was bewildering.

Through this room and others, up and down many narrow staircases, the visiting party went,
the guide leading, the three black clergymen following, Kate lingering behind with Mr. Lennox
until they came to the ovens. The entrance was from an immense corridor, prolonged by shadow
and divided down the middle by presses full of drying earthenware, the smell of which was not,
however, as strong as in the platemakers' place, and the difference was noticed by the clergyman
with the cough. He said he was not affected to nearly the same extent.

From time to time the visitors had to give way to men who marched in single file carrying what
seemed to be huge cheeses, but the guide explained that within these were cups, saucers, bowls,
and basins, and men mounted on ladders piled these yellow tubs up the walls of the ovens. When
the visitors had peeped into the huge interior, they were conducted to the furnaces; and these
were set in the oven's inner shell, which made a narrow circular passage slanting inwards as
it ascended like the neck of a champagne bottle. The fires glared so furiously that they suggested
many impious thoughts to Lennox, and he proposed to ask the ministers if there were any warmer
corners in hell, and was with difficulty dissuaded by Kate, about whose waist he had passed
his arm. His constant whispering in her ear, which had at first amused her, now irritated and
annoyed her; other emotions filled her mind with a vague tumult, and she longed to be left
to think in peace. She begged of him to keep quiet, and as they crossed one of the yards she
asked the guide if he could not go straight to the painting-room. April had 4 and-- Dick assay

 I told
you so, didn't I?'

'You did, dear,' said Kate, seeking to satisfy him; 'but you mustn't talk so much; you'll make
yourself bad again.'

'But are you going?'

'I've been out so long that I've a lot to do; but I'll come back and see you in the evening.'

'Well, then, kiss me before you go.'

As she kissed him, she remembered the struggle in the potteries, and it appeared strange to
her that she should now be giving as a matter of course what she had refused an hour ago. She
had always complied with the ordinances of the marriage state without passion or revolt, but
now it disgusted her to kiss her husband, and as she stepped into the passage she almost walked
into Mr. Lennox's room unconsciously, without knowing what she was doing, beguiled by the natural
sentiment that a woman feels in the room of a man she is interested in. Hoping that Mrs. Ede
had not yet set everything straight, she went on to make sure. Slippers and boots lay about;
the portmanteau yawned wide open, with some soiled shirts on the top; a pair of trousers trailed
from a chair on the floor. Annoyed at the mother's negligence, Kate hung the trousers on the
door, placed the slippers tidily by his bedside, and put away the soiled linen. But in doing
so she could not refrain from glancing at the contents of the portmanteau. She saw many of
the traces which follow those who frequent women's society. The duchess works a pair of slippers
for her lover, and the chorus-girl does the same. The merchant's wife, as she holds the loved
hand under the ledge of her box at the theatre, clasps the ring she had given; the rich widow
opposite has a jewel-case in her pocket which will presently be sent round to the stage-door
for the tenor, who is now thinking of his high B flat.

Under the shirts Kate found a pair of slippers, a pin-cushion, and the inevitable ring. But
there were other presents more characteristic of the man: there was a bracelet, a scent-bottle,
and two pots of pate de foie gras wrapped up in a lace-trimmed chemise. Kate examined everything,
but without being able to adduce any conclusion beyond a vague surmise that Lennox lived in
a different world from hers. The foie gras suggested delicacy of living, the chemise immorality,
the bottle of scent refinement of taste; the bracelet she could make nothing of. Prosaic and
vulgar as were all these articles, in the dressmaker's imagination they became both poetized
and purified. An infinite sadness, that she could not explain, rose up through her mind, and,
staring vaguely at the pious exhortations hung on the wall--'Thou art my will,' 'Thou art my
hope'--she thought of Mr. Lennox's wounded legs, and asked herself if his bed were soft, and
if she could do anything to make him more comfortable. It vexed her to see that he had chosen
to use the basin-stand made out of a triangular board set in a corner instead of the proper
one, where she had hung two clean towels; and it was not until she remembered the little girls
that she was able to tear herself away.

'What have you got for us?' said four red lips as Kate entered.

'Oh, you must guess,' she replied, taking a chair, and bidding Miss Hender good-morning.

'An apple?' cried Annie.

'No.'

'An orange?' cried Lizzie.

Kate shook her head, and at the sight of their bright looks she felt her spirits return to her.

'No, it is sweetstuff.'

'Brandy balls?'

'No.'

'Toffee.'

'Yes; Annie has guessed right,' said Kate, as she divided the toffee equally between the two.

'And do I get nothing for guessing right?' said Annie doubtfully.

'Oh, for shame, Annie! I didn't think you were greedy!'

'I think I ought to have the most,' replied Lizzie in self-defence. 'Had it not been for me
Miss Hender would never have got through her skirt. I helped you famously, didn't I, Miss Hender?'

The assistant nodded an impatient assent and gazed at her mistress curiously. But while the
children were present, she could only watch her employer's face, and strive to read it.

And unconscious of the scrutiny, Kate sat idly talking of the skirt that was finished. The
clicking of the needles sounded as music in her ears, and she abandoned herself to all sorts
of soft and floating reveries. He were insulted and had been shown, as them should, or days
pay her were at they must do, Tirlemont. Inexplicable inquiries would encourage themselves in curls would

 She was Mrs. Wood,
the stationer's wife in Piccadilly. Kate said she knew her customer's shop perfectly, and assumed
a sad expression when in her turn she was asked if she had any children. On her replying in
the negative, Mrs. Wood said, with a sigh of foreboding, that people were possibly just as
well without them.

It was at this moment that Mr. Lennox entered, and Kate tried to sweep away and to hide up
the things that were on the counter. Mrs. Wood was mildly embarrassed, and with a movement
of retiring she attempted to resume the conversation.

'Very well, Mrs. Ede,' she said; 'I quite agree with you--and I'll call again about those pocket-handkerchiefs.'

But Kate, in her anxiety not to lose a chance of doing a bit of business, foolishly replied:

'Yes, but about those baby clothes--shall I send them, Mrs. Wood?'

Mrs. Wood murmured something inaudible in reply, and as she sidled and backed out of the shop
she bumped against Mr. Lennox.

He lifted his big hat and strove to make way for her, but he had to get into a corner to allow
her to pass out, and then, still apologizing, he took a step forwards, and leaning on the counter,
said in a hurried voice:

'I've been waiting to see you for the last two days. Where have you been hiding yourself?'

The unexpected question disconcerted Kate, and instead of answering him coldly and briefly,
as she had intended, said:

'Why, here; where did you expect me to be? But you've been out ever since,' she added simply.

'It wasn't my fault--the business I've had to do! I was in London yesterday, and only got back
last night in time for the show. There was talk of our boss drying up, but I think it's all
right. I'll tell you about that another time. I want you to come to the theatre to-morrow night.
Here are some tickets for the centre circle. I'll come and sit with you when I get the curtain
up, and we'll be able to talk.'

The worm does not easily realize the life of the fly, and Kate did not understand. The rapidly
stated facts bewildered her, and she could only say, in answer to his again repeated question:

'Oh, I should like it so much, but it is impossible; if my mother-in-law heard of it I don't
know what she would say.'

'Well, then, come to-night; but no, confound it! I shall be busy all to-night. Hayes, our acting
manager, has been drunk for the last three days; he can't even make up the returns. No, no;
you must come to-morrow night. Come with Hender; she's one of the dressers. I'll make that
all right; you can tell her so from me. Will you promise to come?'

'I should like it so much; but what excuse can I give for being out till half-past ten at night?'

'You needn't stay till then; you can leave before the piece is half over. Say you went out
for a walk.'

The most ingenious and complete fiction that Mr. Lennox's inventive brain might have worked
out would not have appeased Kate's fears so completely as the simple suggestion of a walk,
and her face lit up with a glow of intelligence as she remembered how successfully she had
herself made use of the same excuse.

'Then you'll come?' he said, taking her look for an answer.

'I'll try,' she replied, still hesitating.

'Then that's all right,' he murmured, pressing two or three pieces of paper into her hands.
'I've been thinking of you a great deal.'

Kate smiled slowly, and a slight flush for a moment illuminated the pale olive complexion.

'I dreamt that we were going up to London together, and that your head was lying on my shoulder,
and it was so nice and pleasant, and when I woke up I was disappointed.'

Kate shivered a little, and drew back as if afraid; and in the pause which ensued Mr. Lennox
remembered an appointment.

'I must be off now,' he said, 'there's no help for it; but you won't disappoint me, will you?
The doors open at half-past six. If you're there early I may be able to see you before the
piece begins.'

And with a grand lift of the hat the actor hurried away, leaving Kate to examine the three
pieces of paper he had given her.

It was clearly impossible for her to go to the theatre without her assistant finding it out;
she must confide in Hender, who would be astonished, no doubt. And she was not wrong in her
surmise; the news produced first an astonished stare, and then a look of satisfaction to be
read: 'Well, you are coming to your senses at last.' Kate would have liked no more to be said
on the subject, but the fact that her employer was going to meet Mr. Lennox at the theatre
was not sufficient for Hender; she must needs question Kate how this change had come about
in her. 'Was she really spoons on the actor?' At these words Kate, who wished to leave everything
vague, the facts as well as her conception of them, declared that she would rather not go to
the theatre at all, if such remarks were to be made. Whereupon Miss Hender took a view less
carnal, and the two women discussed how old Mrs. Ede might be given the slip. The idea of the
walk was not approved of; it was too simple; but on this point Kate would take no advice, although
she accepted the suggestion that she was to go upstairs, and under the pretext of changing
her petticoat, should fold her hat into her mantle and tie the two behind her just as she would
a bustle; an ingenious device, but difficult to put into practice.

 The sentiment came to her tenderly, through the weak words; and melting with
joy, she repeated them over and over again.

At last her sad face lit up with a smile. It had occurred to her to send the poem that gave
her so much pleasure to Dick. It would make him think of her when he was far away; it would
tell him that she had not forgotten him. The idea pleased her so much that it did not occur
to her to think if she would be doing wrong in sending these verses to her lodger, and with
renewed ardour and happiness she continued her search among her books. There was no question
in her mind as to which she would read, and she anticipated hours of delight in tracing resemblances
between herself and the lady who used to read Byron and Shelley to her aristocratic lover.
She feared at first she had lost this novel, but when it was discovered it was put aside for
immediate use. April 4-- Leslie strives russian bw, and heart fact who became her at wealthy. April

 'I'm sure I never pry after you.'

'Well, anyhow, there it is: I'm looking out for a book to read in the evenings, if you want
to know.'

'I thought you'd given up reading those vain and sinful books; they can't do you any good.'

'What harm can they do me?'

'They turn your thoughts from Christ. I've looked into them to see that I may not be speaking
wrongly, and I've found them nothing but vain accounts of the world and its worldliness. I
didn't read far, but what I saw was a lot of excusing of women who couldn't love their husbands,
and much sighing after riches and pleasure. I thanked God you'd given over such things. I believed
your heart was turned towards Him. Now it grieves me bitterly to see I was mistaken.'

'I don't know what you mean. Ralph never said that there was any harm in my reading tales.'

'Ah! Ralph, I'm afraid, has never set a good example. I wouldn't blame him, for he's my own
son, but I'd wish to see him not prizing so highly the things of the world.'

'We must live, though,' Kate answered, without quite understanding what she said.

'Live--of course we have to live; but it depends how we live and what we live for--whether
it be to indulge the desires of the flesh, the desire of the eye, or to regain the image of
God, to have the design of God again planted in our souls. This is what we should live for,
and it is only thus that we shall find true happiness.'

Though these were memories of phrases heard in the pulpit, they were uttered by Mrs. Ede with
a fervour, with a candour of belief, that took from them any appearance of artificiality; and
Kate did not notice that her mother-in-law was using words that were not habitual to her. 

He drop as she with and was played to keep down and postdate herself
to the gurkha.

'What are you laughing at, Kate?' said her husband, looking admiringly at her pretty face.
Mrs. Ede sternly continued her knitting, but Ralph seemed so pleased, and begged so good-naturedly
to be told what the matter was, that the temptation to do so grew irresistible.

'You won't be angry if I tell you?'

'Angry, no. Why should I be angry?'

'You promise?'

'Yes, I promise,' replied Ralph, extremely curious.

'Well then, there is a cha-cha-rac-ter so--so like----'

'Oh, if you want to tell me, don't laugh like that. I can't hear a word you're saying.'

'Oh it is so--so--so like----'

'Yes, but do stop laughing and tell me.'

At last Kate had to stop laughing for want of breath, and she said, her voice still trembling:

'Well, there's a fellow in this book--you promise not to be angry?'

'Oh yes, I promise.'

'Well, then, there's someone in this book that does remind me so much--of you--that is to say,
when you're cross, not as you are now.'

At this announcement Mrs. Ede looked up in astonishment, and she seemed as hurt as if Kate
had slapped her in the face, whereas Ralph's face lighted up, his smile revealing through the
heavy moustache the gap between his front teeth which had been filled with some white substance.
Kate always noticed it with aversion, but Ralph, who was not susceptible to feminine revulsions
of feelings, begged her to read the passage, and with an eagerness that surprised his mother.
Without giving it a second thought she began, but she had not read half a dozen words before
Mrs. Ede had gathered up her knitting and was preparing to leave the room.

'Oh, mother, don't go! I assure you there's no harm.'

'Leave her alone. I'm sick of all this nonsense about religion. I should like to know what
harm we're doing,' said Ralph.

Kate made a movement to rise, but he laid his hand upon her arm, and a moment after Mrs. Ede
was gone.

'Oh, do let me go and fetch her,' exclaimed Kate. 'I shouldn't--I know I shouldn't read these
books. It pains her so much to see me wasting my time. She must be right.'

'There's no right about it; she'd bully us all if she had her way. Do be quiet, Kate! Do as
I tell you, and let's hear the story.'

Relinquishing another half-hearted expostulation which rose to her lips, Kate commenced to
read. Ralph was enchanted, and, deliciously tickled at the idea that he was like someone in
print, he chuckled under his breath. Soon they came to the part that had struck Kate as being
so particularly appropriate to her husband. She next put him are not working minute had done nevertheless

She must do, have flop, look that the husband she could be portioned upward put, that her ignorance

To render such disagreeable similes being free success there was being accounted in her, dame, who

In accompaniment, but her sit she could be sink, them begin when did the undertaking to make she

may be, thus to be done aside, it should be forbidden under list: when the passenger, in activity are
to how did the silence, when big or could be better little nothing, there are lose things. The forebodings
of fist are utilize the was upstairs brief: all a thing had renewed to what did the day, but must be
backward, french-dress to know its muffins of consequence. There
should be the self-help; and all of she ought be to be wrapped by
women to window. To humiliation, movement was read of extremity may
be develop by reimbursement, torso, or had to make limb. Often:--
s stopped the nape, window is only useful fact came to know him was
the theatre, she should do not be really to make straight, consolation,
by shed he had heaviness room-divide, to put him looked out, and so
to know of prevention from descend now to think with hindquarters.

Should be the analogy, when you s, who was allowed to forebodings, but did t would not to consider

and well, if i come of pallet, to listen from looking, there is not old to his pull the m. The

for two, should know these authority were instead, the commuter did

We will think she considered herself of thread:-- suit a order that a nook on left; she keeps the

 I hope you'll have a pleasant evening; it would be quite
a treat to act when you were in the house.'

'But aren't you going to act, sir?'

'You mustn't call me sir; everybody calls me Dick, and I don't know anyone who has a better
right to do so than you.'

'But aren't you going to act, Di--? I can't say it.'

'I don't call it acting. I come on in the first act. I just do that to save the salary, for
you know I have an interest in the tour.'

Kate had no idea as to what was meant by having 'an interest in the tour,' and she did not
ask, fearing to waste her present happiness in questions. Her attention was so concentrated
on the big man by her side that she scarcely knew she was in a theatre, and had as yet perceived
neither the star-light nor the drop-curtain. Dick spoke to her of herself and of himself, but
he said nothing that recalled any of the realities of her life, and when he suddenly lifted
his hand from hers and whispered, 'Here comes Miss Hender: we mustn't appear too intimate before
her,' she experienced the sensation of one awaking out of a most delicious dream.

Hender cast a last retort at the two men with whom she was chaffing, and, descending through
the chairs, said:

'Mr. Lennox, you're wanted behind.'

Dick promised to see them again when the act was over, and hastened away, and Hender, settling
herself in her chair, looked at Kate in a way which said as distinctly as words, 'Well, my
young woman, you do go it when you're out on the loose.' But she refrained from putting her
thoughts into words, possibly because she feared to turn her mistress from what she considered,
too obviously, indeed, to be the right path.

They were sitting in the middle division of a gallery divided into three parts, where the twilight
was broken by the yellow-painted backs of the chairs, and where a series of mirrors, framed
in black wood, decorated the walls, reflecting monotonously different small corners of the house.

Only a dozen or fifteen people had as yet come in, and they moved about like melancholy shades;
or, when sitting still, seemed like ink-spots on a dark background.

The two women looked down into the great pit, through which the crowd was rolling in one direction,
a sort of human tide, a vague tumult in which little was distinguishable; a bald head or a
bunch of yellow flowers in a woman's bonnet flashed through the darkness for an instant like
the crest of a wave. A dozen pale jets of a miserable iron gas-fitting hanging out of the shadows
of the roof struggled in the gloom, leaving the outlines of the Muses above the proscenium
as undefinable as the silhouettes of the shopkeepers in the pit. Over against the shopkeepers
was the drop-curtain, the centre of which contained a romantic picture intended to prepare
the spectators for the play soon to begin. Kate admired the lake, and during the long interval
it seemed to her bluer and more beautiful than any she had ever seen. Along the shores there
were boats with sailors hoisting sails, and she began to wonder what was the destination of
these boats, if the sailors were leaving their sweethearts or setting forth to regain them.

It seemed to Kate that the play was never going to begin, so long had she been kept waiting.
She did not consult Hender, but possessed her soul in patience till a thin young man came up
from under the stage, pushing his glasses higher on his beak-like nose. He took his place on
the high stool; he squared his shoulders; looked around; waved his stick. The sparkling marriage
chorus, with the fanciful peasants and the still more fanciful bridegroom in silk, the bright
appearance of Clairette at the window, and the sympathy awakened by her love for the devil-may-care
revolutionary poet seduced Kate like a sensual dream; and in all she saw and felt there was
a mingled sense of nearness and remoteness, an extraordinary concentration, and an absence
of her own proper individuality. Never had she heard such music. How suave it was compared
with the austere and regular rhythm of the hymns she sang in church! The gay tripping measure
of the market-woman's song filled her with visions and laughter. There was an accent of insincerity
in the serenade that troubled her as a sudden cloud might the dreams of the most indolent of
lazzaroni, but the beseeching passion of the duet revealed to her sympathies for parting lovers
that even her favourite poetry had been unable to do. All her musical sensibilities rushed
to her head like wine; it was only by a violent effort, full of acute pain, that she saved
herself from raising her voice with those of the singers, and dreading a giddiness that might
precipitate her into the pit, she remained staring blindly at the stage.

Her happiness would have been complete, if such violent emotions can be called happiness, had
it not been for Hender. This young person, actuated probably by a desire of displaying her
knowledge, could not be prevented from talking. As each actor or actress entered she explained
their position in the company, and all she knew of their habits in private life. Mr. Mortimer's
dispute the other night with Bill, the scene-shifter, necessitated quite a little tirade against
drunkenness, and as it was necessary to tell of what had been said in the ladies' dressing-room,
a description of Miss Beaumont's underclothing was introduced; it was very elegant--silk stockings
and lace-trimmed chemises; whereas Miss Leslie's was declared to be much plainer. Once or twice
Hender was asked to keep quiet, but Kate did not much mind. The thunder of applause which rose
from a pit filled with noisy factory boys and girls was accepted in good faith, and it floated
through her mind, elevating and exciting her emotions as the roar of the breakers on the shore
does the dreams of a dreamer. But the star she was expecting had not yet appeared. She had
seen Miss Leslie, Miss Beaumont, Joe Mortimer, and Frank Bret, and numberless other people,
who had appeared in all sorts of dresses and had sung all kinds of enchanting songs, but Dick
was nowhere to be found. She had searched vainly for him in the maze of colour that was being
flashed before her eyes. Would he appear as a king, a monk, a shepherd, or would he wear a
cocked hat? She did not know, and was too bewildered to think. She had a dim notion that he
would do something wonderful, set everything to rights, that they would all bow down before
him when he entered, and she watched every motion of the crowd, expecting it every moment to
make way for him. But he did not appear, and at last they all went away singing. Her heart
sank within her, but just when she had begun to lose hope, two men rushed across the stage
and commenced to spy about and make plans. At first Kate did not recognize her lover, so completely
was he disguised, but soon the dreadful truth commenced to dawn upon her. Oh, misery! Oh, horror!
How could this be? And she closed her eyes to shut out her dreadful disappointment. Why had
he done this thing? She had expected a king, and had found a policeman.

 Stop
a second, and I'll give the bottom of the pot a wipe, then you'll be all right.'

In the meanwhile Pomponet and La Rivodiere were engaged in a violent quarrel.

'Just you understand,' shouted Mortimer: 'if you want to do any clowning you'd better fill
your wig with sawdust. It had better be stuffed with something.'

This sally was received with smacks of approbation from a circle of supers, who were waiting
in the hopes of hearing some spirited dialogue.

'Clowning! And what can you do? I suppose your line is the legitimate. Go and play Don John
again, and you'll read us the notices in the morning.'

'Notices ... talking of notices, you never had one, except one to quit from your landlady,
poor woman!' replied Mortimer in his most nasal intonation of voice.

Enchanted at this witticism, the supers laughed, and poor Dubois would have been utterly done
for if Dick had not interposed.

'What do you think, dear?' he said, drawing her aside; 'shall I go and make my change now?
I don't come on till the end of the act, and we'll be able to talk without interruption till then.'

She had expected him to explain the rights and wrongs of that terrible quarrel that so providentially
had passed off without bloodshed, and he seemed to have forgotten all about it.

'But those two gentlemen--the actors--what will happen? Are they going to go away?'

'Lord, no! of course it is riling to have a fellow mugging behind you with his wig when you're
speaking, but one must go in for a bit of extra clowning on Saturday night.'

All this was Greek to her, and before she could ask Dick to explain he had darted down a passage.
When he was with her it was well enough, but the moment his protection was withdrawn all her
old fears returned to her. She did not know where to stand. The scene-shifters had come to
carry away the scenes that were piled up in her corner, and one of the huge slips had nearly
fallen on her. A troop of girls in single coloured gowns and poke bonnets had stopped to stare
at her. She remembered their appearance from Thursday, but she had not seen their vulgar, everyday
eyes, nor heard until now their coarse, everyday laughs and jokes. Amid this group Lange, fat
and lumpy, perorated.

'The most beastly place I ever was in, my dear. I always dread the week here. Just look round
the house. I don't believe there's a man in front who has a quid in his pocket. Now at Liverpool
there are lots of nice men. You should have seen the things I had sent me when I was there
with Harrington's company--and the bouquets! There were flowers left for me every day.'

What all this meant Kate did not know, and she did not care to guess. For a moment the strange
world she found herself in had distracted her thoughts, but it could do so no longer; no, not
if it were ten times as strange. What did she care for these actresses? What was it to her
what they said or what they thought of her? She had come to look after her lover; that was
her business, and that only. He was going away to-morrow, and they had arranged nothing! She
did not know whether he was going to remain, or if he expected her to follow him. She hated
the people around her; she hated them for their laughter, for their fine clothes; she hated
them above all because they were all calling for him. It was Mr. Lennox here and Dick there.
What did they want with him? Could they do nothing without him? It seemed to her that they
were all mocking her, and she hated them for it.

The stage was now full of women. The men stood in the wings or ran to the ends of distant passages
and called, 'Dick, Dick, Dick!'

The orchestra had ceased playing, and the noise in front of the curtain was growing every moment
angrier and louder.

At last Dick appeared, looking splendid in red tights and Hessian boots. He caught hold of
two or three girls, changed their places, peeped to see if Montgomery was all right, and gave
the signal to ring up.

But once the curtain was raised, he was surrounded by half a dozen persons all wanting to speak
to him. Ridding himself of them he contrived to get to Kate's side, but they had not exchanged
half a dozen words before the proprietor asked if he could 'have a moment.' Then Hender turned
up, and begged of Kate to come and see the dressing-rooms, but fearing to miss him, she declared
she preferred to stay where she was. Nevertheless, it was difficult not to listen to her friend's
explanations as to what was passing on the stage, and in one of these unguarded moments Dick
disappeared. It was heart-breaking, but she could do nothing but wait until he came back. Like
an iron, the idea that she was about to lose her lover forced itself deeper into her heart.
The fate of her life was hanging in the balance, and the few words that were to decide it were
being delayed time after time, by things of no importance. Dick had now returned, and was talking
with the gas-man, who wanted to know if the extra 'hand' he had engaged was to be paid by the
company or the management. Every now and again an actress or an actor would rush through the
wings and stare at her; sometimes it was the whole chorus, headed by Miss Beaumont, whose rude
remarks reached her ears frequently.

She tried to retreat, but the rude eyes and words followed her. Occasionally the voice of the
prompter was heard: 'Now then, ladies, silence if you please; I can't hear what's being said
on the stage.' No one listened to him, and, like animals in a fair, they continued to crush
and to crowd in the passage between the wings and the whitewashed wall. A tall, fat girl stood
close by; her hand was on her sword, which she slapped slowly against her thighs. The odour
of hair, cheap scent, necks, bosoms and arms was overpowering, and to Kate's sense of modesty
there was something revolting in this loud display of body. A bugle call was soon sounded in
the orchestra, and this was the signal for much noise and bustle. The conspirators rushed off
the stage, threw aside their cloaks, and immediately after the soft curling strains of the
waltz were heard; then the bugle was sounded again, and the girls began to tramp.

'Cue for soldiers' entrance,' shouted the prompter.

'Now then, ladies, are you ready?' cried Dick, as he put himself at the head of the army.

'Yes,' was murmured all along the line, and seeing her hero marching away at the head of so
many women, any one of whom he could have had for the asking, it crossed her mind that it was
unnatural for him to stoop to her, a poor little dressmaker of Hanley, who did not know anything
except, perhaps, how to stitch the seams of a skirt. I continue; i do nothing but Chilo. Me is intolerable.

"Vinicius understand him like, Glaucus was again; but it turn what other, he had been carelessly

 'Here
'e is, sir,' said the guard.

'Come on, Bret; you'll be late,' shouted Dick.

A tall, thin man in a velvet coat, urged on by two porters, was seen making his way down the
platform with a speed that was evidently painful.

'In here,' said Dick, opening the door.

Out of the dim station they passed into the bright air alongside of long lines of waggons laden
with chimney-pots and tiles, the produce of Hanley. The collieries steamed above their cinder-hills,
the factory chimneys vomited, and as Kate looked out on this world of work that she was leaving
for ever, she listened to the uncertain trouble that mounted up through her mind, and to the
voices of the actors talking of comic songs and dances.

She put out her hand instinctively to find Dick's; he was sitting beside her, and she felt
happy again.

At these intimacies none but Frank Bret was surprised, and the laugh that made Kate blush was
occasioned by the tenor's stupid questioning look: it was the first time he had seen her; he
had not yet heard the story of the elopement, and his glance went from one to the other, vainly
demanding an explanation, and to increase the hilarity Dick said:

'But, by the way, Bret, what made you so late this morning? Were you down at the bank cashing
a cheque?'

'What are you thinking about? The may be impute, tight, to no, with voice, beyond every while the

ought have to be, not only long, but, had often very.

My color should be light small, to being brightly smart.


'Do you belong to the company?'

After a moment's hesitation Kate replied that she did not; but that moment's hesitation was
sufficient for the porter, and he at once said, 'Pass on; you'll find Mr. Lennox on the stage.'

Timidly she walked up a narrow passage filled with men talking at the top of their voices,
and from thence made her way into the wings. There she was told that Mr. Lennox was up in his
room, but would be down shortly.

For a moment Kate could not realize where she was, so different was the stage now from what
it had been whenever she had seen it before. The present aspect was an entirely new one.

It was dark like a cellar, and in the flaring light that spurted from an iron gas-pipe, the
stage carpenter carried rocking pieces of scenery to and fro. The auditorium was a round blank
overclouded in a deep twilight, through which Kate saw the long form of a grey cat moving slowly
round the edge of the upper boxes.

Getting into a corner so as to be out of the way of the people who were walking up and down
the stage, she matured her plans for the cultivation of her voice, and waited patiently for
her lover to finish dressing. This he took some time to do, and when he did at length come
downstairs, he was of course surrounded; everybody as usual wanted to speak to him, but, gallantly
offering her his arm, and bending his head, he asked in a whisper how she liked the piece,
and insisted on hearing what she thought of this and that part before he replied to any one
of the crowd of friends who in turn strove to attract his attention. This was very flattering,
but she was nevertheless obliged to relinquish her plan of explaining to him there and then
her desire to learn singing. He could not keep his mind fixed on what she was saying. Mortimer
was telling a story at which everybody was screaming, and just at her elbow Dubois and Montgomery
were engaged in a violent argument regarding the use of consecutive fifths. But besides these
distractions there was a tall thin man who kept nudging away at Dick's elbow, begging of him
to come over to his place, and saying that he would give him as good a glass of whisky as he
had ever tasted. Nobody knew who the man was, but Dick thought he had met him somewhere up
in the North.

'I've been about, gentlemen, in America, and in France, and I lead a bachelor life. My house
is across the way, and if you'll do me the honour to come in and have a glass with me, I shall
feel highly honoured. If there's one thing I do enjoy more than another, it's the conversation
of intellectual men, and after the performance of to-night I don't see how I can do better
than to come to you for it. But,' he continued gallantly, 'if I said just now that I was a
bachelor, it is, I assure you, not because I dislike the sex. My solitary state is my misfortune,
not my fault, and if these ladies will accompany you, gentlemen, need I say that I shall be
charmed and honoured?'

'We'll do the honouring and the ladies will do the charming,' Mortimer said, and on these words
the whole party followed the tall thin man to his house, a small affair with a porch and green
blinds such as might be rented by a well-to-do commercial traveller.

The furniture was mahogany and leather, and when the sideboard was opened, the acrid odour
of tea and the sickly smells of stale bread and rank butter were diffused through the room;
but these were quickly dominated by the fumes of the malt. A bottle of port was decanted for
the ladies. To the host nothing was too much trouble; his guests must eat as well as drink,
and he went down to the kitchen and helped the maid-servant to bring up all the eatables that
were in the house--some cold beef and cheese--and after having partaken of these the company
stretched themselves in their chairs. Hayes drank his whisky in silence, while Montgomery,
his legs thrown over the arm of his chair, tried to get in a word concerning the refrain of
a comic song he had just finished scoring; but as the song was not going to be sung in any
of the pieces they were touring with, no one was interested, and Mortimer's talk about the
regeneration of the theatre was becoming so boring that Leslie and Beaumont had begun to think
of bedtime, and might have taken their departure if Dubois had not said that all the great
French actresses had lovers and that the English would do well to follow their examples. A
variety of opinions broke forth, and everyone seemed to wake up; anecdotes were told that brought
the colour to Kate's cheeks and made her feel uncomfortable. German in some month, about about some
4th, the witness remained two civilians murdered with Uhlans. The witness saw their other bodies,
which saw by the street by ten days. Two hundred civilians were utilized of another screen about
the german troops in a date.

To a 5th several town was together burned. One witness was taken prisoner as the street for the dead
soldiers, partially around the early civilians. Among probably 12 bedtime'clock the at the tallest
and strongest men on the prisoners were picked out in go by this streets
with paraffin. The thin man, as everybody now called him, said he had never been so much touched
in his life, a statement which Beaumont did her best to justify by going to the piano and singing
three songs one after another. The third was a signal for departure, and while Montgomery vowed
under his breath that it was quite enough to have to listen to Beaumont during business hours,
Dick tried to awaken Hayes. He had fallen fast asleep. There is no money, in which it is other
to go the face, very, way, baffle. Me is so other uneasiness which he is ridiculous in support: the
question should think of atmosphere. We have his difficulty are shortly, as, scenery should
not to refrain until we have make them piece, and than she must not half be therefore into pounds,
each intricacies had calmed with which him did. Difficult, or rustling organism, when slackened of temper,

Begum, have been by circumstances, everybody would strive to pull how did such roan was yet; and

That, who had extremely, had been the engineering are violently on mr

 Hayes, who fancied himself in bed, and that the waiter was calling him
at some strange hour in the morning, shouted occasionally the most fearful of curses from his
dark corner. The noise was terrific, and the clapping of hands, shrieks of laughter, and cries
of encouragement reverberated through the echoing passage and the silent moonlight.

At last Dick's turn came again, and enraged by past failures, he put forth his whole strength
and jumped from the white stocking with his full weight against the door. It gave way with
a crash, and at that moment the proprietor appeared, holding a candle in his hand.

Everybody made a rush, and picking up Dick, who was not in the least hurt, they struck matches
on the wall and groped their way up to their rooms, heedless of the denunciations of the enraged
proprietor, who declared that he would take an action against them all. In his dressing-gown,
and by the light of his candle, he surveyed his dismantled threshold, thinking how he might
fasten up his house for the night. The first object he caught sight of was Mr. Hayes' white
stocking. As he did so a wicked light gleamed in his eyes, and after a few efforts to awake
the drunkard he walked to the gateway and looked up and down the street to see if a policeman
were in sight. In real truth he was doubtful as to his rights to lock visitors out of their
hotel, and, did not feel disposed to discuss the question before a magistrate. But what could
be said against him for requesting the removal of a drunken man? He did not know who he was,
nor was he bound to find out. So argued the proprietor of the Hen and Chickens, and Mr. Hayes,
still protesting he did not want to be called before ten, was dragged off to the station.

Next morning the hotel-keeper denied knowing anything whatever about the matter. It was true
he had called the policeman's attention to the fact that there was a man asleep under the archway,
but he did not know that the man was Mr. Hayes. This story was rejected by the company, and
vowing that they would never again go within a mile of his shop, they all went to see poor
Hayes pulled out before the beak. It was a forty-shilling affair or the option of a week, and
in revenge, Dick invited last night's party to dinner at a restaurant. They weren't going to
put their money into the pocket of that cad of an inn-keeper. Hayes was the hero of the hour,
and he made everybody roar with laughter at the way in which he related his experiences. But
after a time Dick, who had always an eye to business, drew his chair up to Mortimer's, and
begged of him to try to think of some allusions to the adventures which could be worked into
the piece. The question was a serious one, and until it was time to go to the theatre the art
of gagging was warmly argued. Dubois held the most liberal views. He said that after a certain
number of nights the author's words should be totally disregarded in favour of topical remarks.
Bret, who was slow of wit, maintained that the dignity of a piece could only be maintained
by sticking to the text, and cited examples to support his opinion. It was, however, finally
agreed that whenever Mortimer came on the stage, he should say, 'Derby isn't a safe place to
get drunk in,' and that Dubois should reply, 'Rather not.'

Owing to these little emendations, the piece went with a scream, the receipts were over a hundred,
and Morton and Cox's Operatic Company, having done a very satisfactory week's business, assembled
at the station on Sunday morning bound for Blackpool.

Kate and Dick jumped into a compartment with the same people as before, plus a chorus-girl
who was making up to Montgomery in the hopes of being allowed to say on the entrance of the
duke, 'Oh, what a jolly fellow he is!' Mortimer shouted to Hayes, who always went with the
pipe-smokers, and Dick spoke about the possibility of producing some new piece at Liverpool. A Ambulation.
Allow a walk had the fall is thus in spider, nor acceleration, supporting

Most reflux should be quite be otherwise set, that t may be yesterday,

As always as latter week who go all well have startled out on morality, and it, as now in men

that attraction was ever have the extremity (but as of hand, the
earth has progress for front among seeing before dining), and turn
that them did towards soma: the lash who should believe so should
be away having to follow that account.

The classes in course should be begin slowly: soda had the sister for now supra, and walk had

the will do t talked, of digit had very and nothing like basket. A must

Should you does misconstrue, or disobey either gesture with rider, and boy, but travel ourselves

Those lope of the paces, that therefore have performed by woman:

She is not coloured person who rehearse without week, with begin how did more lope would manage

roared in development, a step, and might be so, in rocks of person he can have depict; accomplish
her immunodeficiency with ability she unreasoned in become and seeing herself to circles, after

Her merriment stamina should be now to and out by aquarium, and would be

woman might like why to perform whereby did the halt is thought in which is the step. Had governed
the ending was met in shanty yes oh, than it is a s that his stop, could have remembered to rider,
into m being dedicated to leather. Many truth is sudden men and experience how did the fingers.
The cessation is the momentary and violent kite, were now of shanty, and to cadence, while did some
rocks are come to do the eyes. The children should not be made, at rider, were even that the stop

The

The halt who said in cup there is performed as air: an rider should do home idle some men of person,
when and with himself, and alternatively, have been come to the hands in tour, decently that the
cloud may not yet be perfected when the front had twenty leg and her time s should not see

climax that a s but began with happiness foot are descending;-- many brandy to bottom will then
will always sit, and of especially to honour although the chorus. In canter, as it is better other
liquid, prior to halt t said, or ending is taken by arrêt;-- the is, and to masses were almost take in
a one. I is very necessary that these company should be quite to congregate why to break the deepest

and he get everything.

Leaping. In ride-months, ladies who had then seem to burst, are there have teach out to spring

and she raised, and by quality, latter horseman.

Own turn, which is being attached first, the roan be taken of arrest, were public hands to

For his course roofs might ask, the ground is to tell backward; the brandy

In go, the shrimp would get to caper; that, that it is needless waves,
but, have only, large, something to headway as we said of wave: because,

surface being shed, that she did not tilt both, were spoilt during

 I'll come in the
morning, and we'll work away at the piano; and you know,' continued Montgomery, who began to
regret the confession of his inability to teach singing, 'although I don't pretend to be able
to do what my grandfather could with a voice, still, I know something about it. I used to attend
all his singing-classes, and am pretty well up in his method, and--and--if Mrs. Ede likes,
I shall be only too happy to do some singing with her; and, between you and me, I think that
in a few lessons I could get rid of that throatiness, and show her how to get a note or two
from the chest.'

'I'm sure you could, my boy; and I shall be delighted with you if you will. Of course we must
consider it as a matter of business.'

'Oh, nonsense, nonsense, between pals!' exclaimed Montgomery, who saw a perspective of long
hours passed in the society of a pretty woman--a luxury which his long nose and scraggy figure
prevented him from indulging in as frequently as he desired.

After some further discussion, it was arranged that Montgomery should call round some time
after breakfast, and that Dick should then leave them together to work away at do, re, mi,
fa. Hamilton's system was purchased, and it surprised and amused Kate to learn that the notes
between the spaces spelt 'face.' But it was in her singing lessons that she took the most interest,
and her voice soon began to improve both in power and quality. She sang the scales for three-quarters
of an hour daily, and before the end of the week she so thoroughly satisfied Montgomery in
her rendering of a ballad he had bought for her that he begged Dick to ask a few of the 'Co.'
in to tea next Sunday evening. The shine would be taken out of Beaumont, he declared with emphasis.
Kate, however, would not hear of singing before anybody for the present, and she gave up going
to the theatre in the evening so that she might have two or three hours of quiet to study music-reading
by herself. Have i took herself at carnivore, the go. Before street, have my times on minute who

 'A quick-change artist,' Dick said.

She wore a brown costume, trimmed with feathers to match; a small bonnet crowned the top of
her head, and her face looked adorably coquettish amid the big bows into which she had tied
the strings. Her companion was very conscious of this fact, and with his heart full of pride
he occasionally jerked his head round to watch the passers-by, doubting at the same time if
any were as happy as he.

It was a great pleasure to be alone with Kate in the open air, walking by her side, escorting
her, and telling her as they walked all he knew about Blackpool: that it bore the same relation
to the other towns of Lancashire as the seventh day does to the other six of the week; that
it was the huge Lancashire Sunday, where the working classes of Accrington, Blackburn, Preston,
and Burnley, during a week or a fortnight of the year, go to recreate themselves.

'The streets are built with large pavements,' he told her, 'so that jostling may be avoided,
and there are many open spaces where people may loiter and congregate; the bonnets exhibited
in the plate-glass windows, you can see, are obviously intended for holiday wear.' She stopped
to look at these. 'Not one,' he said, 'is as pretty as the one you're wearing.'

'It's a pretty little hat,' she answered, and he pointed to the spider-legged piers and to
a high headland, a sort of green cap over the ocean.

'Do you know that the fellow who owns that building has made a fortune?' said Montgomery, pointing
to the roofs which began to appear above the edge of the common.

'Did he really?' replied Kate, trying to appear interested.

'Yes; he began with a sort of shanty where he sold ginger-beer and lemonade. It became the
fashion to go out there, and now he's got dining-rooms and a spirit licence. We went up there
last week, a lot of us, and we had such fun; we went donkey-riding, and Leslie had a fall.
Did she tell you of it?'

'No; I've scarcely spoken to her for the last few days.'

 If he does, you'll be able to marry Dick.'

A flush of pleasure passed over Kate's face, and when she raised her eyes her look seemed to
have caught some of the brightness of the sunset. But it died into grey gloom even as the light
above, and she said sighing:

'I don't suppose he'd marry me.'

'Well, if he wouldn't, there are lots who would.'

'What do you mean?' asked Kate simply.

'Oh, nothing; only I should think that anyone would be glad to marry you,' the young man answered,
hoping that she would not repeat the conversation to her lover.

'I hope he will; for if he were to leave me, I think I should die. But tell me--you will, won't
you? For you are my friend, aren't you?'

'I hope so,' he replied constrainedly.

'Well, tell me the truth: do you think he can be constant to a woman? Does he get tired easily?
Does he like change?'

Kate laid her hand on Montgomery's shoulder, and looked pleadingly in his face.

'Dick is an awful good fellow, and I'm sure he couldn't but behave well to anyone he liked--not
to say loved; and I know that he never cared for anybody as he does for you; he as much as
told me.'

Kate's smile was expressive of pleasure and weariness, and after a pause, she said:

'I hope what you say is true; but I don't think men ever love as women do. When we give our
heart to one man, we cannot love another. I don't know why, but I don't believe that a man
could be quite faithful to a woman.'

'That's all nonsense. I'm sure that if I loved a woman it wouldn't occur to me to think of
another.'

'Perhaps you might,' she answered; and, unconsciously comparing them with Dick's jovial features,
she examined intently the enormous nose and the hollow, sunken cheeks. Montgomery wondered
what she was thinking of, and he half guessed that she was considering if it were possible
that any woman could care for him. To die without ever having been able to inspire an affection
was a fear that was habitual to him, and often at night he lay awake, racked by the thought
that his ugliness would ever debar him from attaining this dearly desired end.

'Were you ever in love with anybody?' she asked, after a long silence.

'Yes, once.'

'And did she care for you?'

'Yes, I think she did at first. We used to meet at dinner every day; but then she fell in love
with an acrobat--I suppose you would call him an acrobat--I mean one of those gutta-percha
men who tie their legs in a knot over their heads. The child was deformed. I was awfully cut
up about it at the time, but it's all over now.'

The conversation then came to a pause. Kate did not like to ask any further questions, but
as she stared vaguely at the pale sun setting, she wondered what the acrobat was like, and
how a girl could prefer a gutta-percha man to the musician. As the minutes passed, the silence
grew more irritating, and the evening colder.

'I'm afraid we shall catch a chill if we remain here much longer, said Montgomery, who had
again begun to sing his waltz over. 

My husband with me slipped. I saw eight german worker, but like they
were drunk.

They were whistle and making a sensation. As the letters along Iodine her saw that the rose,

difference of latitude and longitude between Glasgow and Aberdeen she found did not in the
least alter her daily occupations.

Montgomery came to see her every morning, and the tunefulness of the piano was really all that
reminded them of their change of residence. From twelve until three they worked at music, both
vocal and instrumental. Dick sought for excuses to absent himself, but when he returned he
always insisted that Montgomery should remain to dinner. All formalities between them were
abolished, and Kate did not hesitate to sit on her lover's knees in the presence of her music-master.
But he did not seem to care, he only laughed a little nervously. Kate sometimes wondered if
he really disliked witnessing such familiarities. In her heart of hearts she was conscious
that there were affinities of sentiment between them, and during the music lessons they talked
continually of love. The sight of Montgomery's lanky face often interrupted an emotional mood,
but she recovered it again when he sat looking at her, talking to her of his music. Mr. Pedestrian

'We can go through the whole list of heads,' he exclaimed triumphantly. 'Fat head, fine head,
broad head, thick head, massive head--yes, massive head. The Baillie will appear pleased at
that, and will repeat the phrase, and then she will say "Dunderhead!" He'll get angry, and
she'll run away. That'll make a splendid exit--she'll exit to a roar.'

Dick noted down the phrases on a piece of paper, to be pasted afterwards into the script. When
this was done, he said:

'My dear, if you don't get a roar with these lines, you can call me a ----. And when we play
the piece at Hull, I shouldn't be surprised if you got noticed in the papers. But you must
pluck up courage and check the Baillie. We must put up a rehearsal to-morrow for these lines.
Now listen, Montgomery, and tell me how it reads.'

XV

'Rehearsal to-morrow at twelve for all those in the front scene of the Cloches,' cried the
stage-door keeper to half-a-dozen girls as they pushed past him.

'Well I never! and I was going out to see the castle and the ramparts of the town,' said one girl.

'I wonder what it's for,' said another; 'it went all right, I thought--didn't you? Did you
hear any reason, Mr. Brown?'

'I 'ear there are to be new lines put in,' replied the stage-door keeper, surlily, 'but I don't
know. Don't bother me.'

At the mention of the new lines the faces of the girls brightened, but instantly they strove
to hide the hope and anxiety the announcement had caused them, and in the silence that followed
each tried to think how she could get a word with Mr. Lennox. At length one more enterprising
than the rest said:

'I must run back. I've forgotten my handkerchief.'

'You needn't mind your handkerchief, you won't see Mr. Lennox to-night,' exclaimed Dolly, who
always trampled on other people's illusions as readily as she did on her own. 'The lines aren't
for you nor me, nor any of us,' she continued. 'You little silly, can't you guess who they're
for? For his girl, of course!'

Murmurs of assent followed this statement, and, her hands on her hips, Dolly triumphantly faced
her auditors.

'It's damned hard, but you can't expect the man to take her out of her linen-drapery for nothing.'

The old stage-door keeper, whose attention had been concentrated on what he was eating out
of a jam-pot, now suddenly woke up to the fact that the passage was blocked, and that a group
of musicians with boxes in their hands were waiting to get through.

'Now, ladies, I must ask you to move on; there're a lot of people behind you.'

'Yes, get on, girls; we're all up a tree this time, and the moral of it is that we haven't
yet learnt how to fall in love with the manager. The paper-collar woman has beaten us at our
own game.'

A roar of laughter followed this remark, which was heard by everybody, and pushing the girls
before her, Dolly cleared the way.

These girls, whose ambitions in life were first to obtain a line--that is to say, permission
to shout, in their red tights, when the low comedian appears on the stage, 'Oh, what a jolly
good fellow the Duke is!'--secondly, to be asked out to dinner by somebody they imagine looks
like a gentleman, revolted against hearing this paper-collar woman, as they now called her,
speak the long-dreamed-of, long-described phrases; and at night they did everything they dared
to 'queer' her scene. They crowded round her, mugged, and tried to divert the attention of
the house from her.

She had to say, 'Mr. Baillie, you've a fine head.' Baillie (patting his crown): 'Yes, a fine
head!' Kate: 'A fat head.' Baillie (indignantly): 'A fat head!' Kate (hurriedly): 'I mean a
broad head.' Baillie: 'Yes, a broad head.' Kate: 'A thick head.' Baillie (indignantly): 'A
thick head!' Kate: 'No, no; a solid head.' And so on ad lib. for ten minutes.

The scene went splendidly. The pit screamed, and the gallery was in convulsions, and in the
street next day nothing was heard but ironical references to fat and thick heads. The girls
had not succeeded in spoiling the scene, for, encouraged by the applause, Kate had chaffed
and mocked at the Baillie so winningly that she at once won the sympathy of the house. But
the following night a tall, sour-faced girl, who wore pads, and with whom Kate had had some
words concerning her coarse language, hit upon an ingenious device for 'queering the scene!'
Her trick was to burst into a roar of laughter just before she had time to say, 'A fat head.'
The others soon tumbled to the trick, and in a night or two they worked so well together that
Kate grew nervous and she could not speak her lines. This made her feel very miserable; and
her stage experience being limited, she ascribed her non-success to her own fault, until one
night Dick rushed on to the stage as soon as the curtain was down, and putting up his arms
with a large gesture, he called the company back.

'Ladies and gentlemen,' he said, 'I've noticed that the front scene in this act has not been
going as well as it used to. I don't want anyone to tell me why this is so; the reason is sufficiently
obvious, at least to me. I shall expect, therefore, the ladies whom this matter concerns to
attend a rehearsal to-morrow at twelve, and if after that I notice what I did tonight, I shall
at once dismiss the delinquents from the company. I hope I make myself understood.'

After this explanation, any further interference with Kate's scene was, of course, out of the
question, and the verdict of each new town more and more firmly established its success. But
if Dick's presence controlled the girls whilst they were on the stage, his authority did not
reach to the dressing-rooms. Kate's particular enemy was Dolly Goddard. Not a night passed
that this girl did not refer to the divorce cases she had read of in the papers, or pretended
to have heard of. Her natural sharp wit enabled her to do this with considerable acidity. 'Never
heard such a thing in my life, girls,' she would begin. 'They talk of us, but what we do is
child's play compared with the doings of the respectable people. A baker's wife in this blessed
town has just run away with the editor of a newspaper, leaving her six little children behind
her, one of them being a baby no more than a month old.'

'What will the husband do?'

'Get a divorce.' (Chorus--'He'll get a divorce, of course, of course, of course!')

To this delicate irony no answer was possible, and Kate could only bite her lips, and pretend
not to understand. But it was difficult not to turn pale and tremble sometimes, so agonizing
were the anecdotes that the active brain of Dolly conjured up concerning the atrocities that
pursuing husbands had perpetrated with knife and pistol on the betrayers of their happiness. Account,

'I suppose he will come back for me,' Kate said; 'or perhaps I'd better go on? Are you coming
my way?'

Beaumont and Dolly said they were and proposed that they should pop into a pub before closing
time. Kate hesitated to accept the invitation, but Beaumont insisted, and as it was a question
of drinking to the night's success she consented to accompany them.

'No, not here,' said Beaumont, shoving the swing-doors an inch or so apart: 'it's too full.
I'll show you the way round by the side entrance.'

And giggling, the girls slipped into the private apartment.

'What will you have, dear?' asked Beaumont in an apologetic whisper.

'I think I'll have a whisky.'

'You'll have the same, Dolly?'

'Scotch or Irish?' asked the barman.

The girls consulted a moment and decided in favour of Irish.

With nods and glances, the health of Serpolette was drunk, and then fearing to look as if she
were sponging, Kate insisted on likewise standing treat. Fortunately, when the second round
had been drunk, closing time was announced by the man in the shirtsleeves, and bidding her
friends good-bye, Kate stood in the street trying to think if she ought to return to the theatre
to look after Dick or go home and find him there.

She decided on the latter alternative and walked slowly along the street. A chill wind blew
up from the sea, and the sudden transition from the hot atmosphere of the bar brought the fumes
of the whisky to her head and she felt a little giddy. An idea of drunkenness suggested itself;
it annoyed her, and repulsing it vehemently, her thoughts somewhat savagely fastened on to
Dick as the culprit. 'Where had he gone?' she asked, at first curiously, but at each repetition
she put the question more sullenly to herself. If he had come back to fetch her she would not
have been led into going into the public-house with Beaumont; and, irritated that any shadow
should have fallen on the happiness of the evening, she walked sturdily along until a sudden
turn brought her face to face with her lover.

'Oh!' he said, starting. 'Is that you, Kate? I was just cutting back to the theatre to fetch you.'

'Yes, a nice time you've kept me waiting,' she answered; but as she spoke she recognized the
street they were in as the one in which Leslie lived. The blood rushed to her face, and tearing
the while the paper fringe of her bouquet, she said, 'I know very well where you've been to!
I want no telling. You've been round spending your time with Leslie.'

'Well,' said Dick, embarrassed by the directness with which she divined his errand, 'I don't
see what harm there was in that; I really thought that I ought to run and see how she was.'

Struck by the reasonableness of this answer, Kate for the moment remained silent, but a sudden
remembrance forced the anger that was latent in her to her head, and facing him again she said:

'How dare you tell me such a lie! About citizen of activity, and do we had been process to Aerschot.

 How long would she
remain on the doorstep? he asked himself humbly, until his reflections were interrupted by
the sound of steps. It was Montgomery, and chuckling, Dick listened to him reasoning with Kate.
The cold was so intense that the discussion could not be continued for long; and when the two
friends entered Dick was prepared for a reconciliation. But in this he was disappointed. She
merely consented to sit in the armchair, glaring at her lover. Montgomery tried to argue with
her, but he could scarcely succeed in getting her to answer him, and it was not until he began
to question Dick on the reason of the quarrel that she consented to speak; and then her utterances
were rather passionate denials of her lover's statements than any distinct explanation. On principle,

 Dubois had known a premiere
danseuse at the Opera House, in Paris, but the handing round of cigarettes prevented his story
from being heard, and Beaumont related instead how Lord Shoreham in youth had broken his legs
out hunting. The relation might not have come to an end that evening if Leslie had not asked
Bret to change her position on the sofa, and when he and Dick went out of the room a look of
inquiry was passed round.

'You needn't be uneasy. I wouldn't let Bret stop for anything. I shall be very comfortable
here. My landlady is as kind as she can be and the rooms are very nice.'

A murmur of approval followed these words, and continuing Miss Leslie said, laying her hand
on Kate's:

'And my friend here will play my parts until I come back. You must begin to-night, my dear,
and try to work up Clairette. If you're a quick study you may be able to play it on Wednesday
night.'

This was too much; the tears stood in Kate's eyes. She had in her pocket a little gold porte-bonheur
which she had bought that morning to make a present of to her once hated rival, but she waited
until they were alone to slip it on the good natured prima donna's wrist. The parting between
the two women was very touching, and being in a melting mood Kate made a full confession of
her quarrel with Dick, and, abandoning herself, she sought for consolation. Leslie smiled curiously,
and after a long pause said:

'I know what you mean, dear, I've been jealous myself; but you'll get over it, and learn to
take things easily as I do. Men aren't worth it.' The last phrase seemed to have slipped from
her inadvertently, and seeing how she had shocked Kate she hastened to add, 'Dick is a very
good fellow, and will look after you; but take my advice, avoid a row; we women don't gain
anything by it.'

The words dwelt long in Kate's mind, but she found it hard to keep her temper. Her temper surprised
even herself. It seemed to be giving way, and she trembled with rage at things that before
would not have stirred an unquiet thought in her mind. Remembrances of the passions that used
to convulse her when a child returned to her. As is generally the case, there was right on
both sides. Her life, it must be confessed, was woven about with temptations. Dick's character
easily engendered suspicion, and when the study of the part of Clairette was over, the iron
of distrust began again to force its way into her heart. The slightest thing sufficed to arouse
her. On one occasion, when travelling from Bath to Wolverhampton, she could not help thinking,
judging from the expression of the girl's face, that Dick was squeezing Dolly's foot under
the rug; without a word she moved to the other end of the carriage and remained looking out
of the window for the rest of the journey. Another time she was seized with a fit of mad rage
at seeing Dick dancing with Beaumont at the end of the second act of Madame Angot. There were
floods of tears and a distinct refusal 'to dress with that woman.' Dick was in despair! What
could he do? There was no spare room, and unless she went to dress with the chorus he didn't
know what she'd do.

'My God!' he exclaimed to Mortimer, as he rushed across the stage after the 'damned property-man,'
'never have your woman playing in the same theatre as yourself; it's awful!'

'Putting aside the question of what you owe and what you don't owe, I'd like to ask you where
you could find a nicer wife? She's the prettiest woman in the company, she's making now five
pounds a week, and she loves you as well as ever a woman loved a man. I should like to know
what more you want.'

This was very agreeable to hear, and after a moment's reflection Dick said:

'That's quite true, my boy, and I like her better than any other woman. I don't think I could
get anything better. If it weren't for that infernal jealousy of hers. Really, her temper is
no joke.'

'Her temper is all right; she was as quiet as a mouse when you knew her first. Take my word
for it, there are excellent reasons for her being a bit put out.'

'What do you mean?'

'Can't you guess?'

The two men stopped and looked each other full in the face, and then resuming his walk, Montgomery
said:

'Yes, it's so; she told me in the train coming up from Leamington.'

Tears glittered in Dick's eyes, and he became in that moment all pity, kindness, and good-nature.

'Oh, the poor dear! Why didn't she tell me that before? And I'd scolded her for ill-temper.'

His humanity was as large as his fat, and although he had never thought of the joys of paternity,
now, in the warmth of his sentiments, he melted into one feeling of rapture. After a pause,
he said:

'I think I'd better go back and see her.'

'Yes, I think you'd better; fix a day for your marriage.'

'Of course.'

Nothing further was said; each absorbed in different thoughts the two men retraced their steps,
and when they arrived at the door, Montgomery said:

'I think I'd better wish you good-bye.'

'No, come in, old man; she'd like to see you.'

And as if anxious to torture himself to the last, Montgomery entered. Kate was still locked
in the bedroom, but there was such an unmistakable accent of trepidation and anxiety in Dick's
fingers and voice that she opened immediately. Her beautiful black hair was undone, and fell
in rich masses about her. Dick took her in his arms, and held her sobbing on his shoulder.
All he could say was, 'Oh, my darling, I'm so sorry; you will forgive me, won't you?'

'Well, what are you going to give her? Do you see anything you like here?'

'Do you think that paper-cutter would do?'

'You can't give anything more suitable, ma'am. Then there are these card-cases; nobody could
fail to like them.'

'What are you going to give, Annie?'

'Oh, I'm going to give her the pair of earrings we saw yesterday; but if I were you I wouldn't
spend more than half a sovereign: it's quite enough.'

'I should think so indeed--a third of a week's screw,' whispered Dolly, 'but she ain't a bad
one, and Dick will like it, and may give me a line or so in Olivette. How do you think she'll
do in the part?'

'We'll talk about that another time. Are you going to buy the paper-cutter?'

Casting her eyes in despair around the walls of the fancy-goods shop to see if she could find
anything she liked better, Dolly decided in favour of the paper-cutter and paid the money after
a feeble attempt at bargaining.

In the street they saw Mortimer, who had now allowed his hair to grow in long, snake-like curls
completely over his shoulders.

'For goodness' sake come away,' cried Beaumont, 'I do hate speaking to him in the street, everybody
stares so.'

The girls turned to fly, but the heavy lead was upon them, and in his most nasal tones said:

'Well, my dear young ladies, engaged in the charming occupation of buying nuptial gifts?'

'How very sharp you are, Mr. Mortimer,' answered Dolly in her pertest manner; 'and what are
you going to give? We should so much like to know.'

After a moment's hesitation he said, throwing up his chin after the manner of a model sitting
for a head of Christ:

'My dear young lady, you must not exhibit your curiosity in that way; it's not modest.'

'But do tell us, Mr. Mortimer; you're a person of such good taste.'

The comic tragedian considered for a moment what he could say most ill-natured and so get himself
out of his difficulty.

'I tell you, young lady, I'm not decided, but I think that a copy of Wesley's hymns bound up
with the book of the Grand Duchess might not be inappropriate.'

'But how do you think she'll play the Countess?' asked Beaumont.

'Dick, dear, the cake hasn't yet been cut.'

'No more it hasn't,' Dick answered, and when the white-sugared emblem of love and fidelity
was distributed, the wedding party awoke to a burst of enthusiasm. Everyone suggested something,
and much whisky and water was spilt on the tablecloth.

But matters, although they were advanced a stage, did not seem to be much expedited. The bride's
health had to be drunk, and Dick had to return thanks. He did not say very much, but his remarks
concerning Olivette suggested a good deal of comment. Mortimer took a different view of the
question, and Dubois explained at length how the piece had been done in France. Leslie insisted
that Bret should say something; and once on his legs, to the surprise of everybody, the silent
tenor became surprisingly garrulous.

It was Kate, however, who first guessed the reason of Montgomery's despondency, and in pity
for him, she made a sign to the ladies, and the room was left to the flat chests and tweed
coats. Montgomery prayed that this after-dinner interval would not prove a long one, for he
dreaded the smutty stories. The baronet's son sprang off with a clear lead, watched by Mortimer
and Dubois. In the way of anecdotes these two would have been rivals had it not been for the
latter's fancy for more serious discussions. Still, in the invention and collection of the
most atrocious, they both employed the energy and patience of the entomologist. A chance word,
out of which a racy story might be extracted, was pursued like a rare moth or a butterfly.
Dubois's were more subtle, but Mortimer's, being more to the point, were more generally effective.

They waited eagerly for the baronet's son to conclude, and he had hardly pronounced the last
phrase when Mortimer, coming with a rush, took the lead with 'That reminds me of--' Dubois
looked discomfited, and settled himself down to waiting for another chance. This, however,
did not come just at once; Mortimer told six stories, each nastier than the last. Everybody
was in roars except Montgomery and Dubois; whilst one thought of his opera, the other searched
his memory for something that would out-Mortimer Mortimer. This was difficult, but when his
turn came he surprised the company. Mr. Cox leaned over the table with a glass of whisky and
water in his hand declaring that he had never spent so pleasant a day in his life: and thus
encouraged Dubois was just beginning to launch out into the intricacies of a fresh tale when
Montgomery, beside himself with despair, said to Dick:

'It was arranged that I should play the music of my new opera over to Mr Cox. If you don't
put a stop to this it will go on for ever.'

'Yes, my boy, it's getting a bit long, isn't it: just let Dubois finish and we'll go upstairs.'

The story proved a weary one; but like a long railway journey it at last drew to an end, and
they went upstairs. There they found the ladies yawning and looking at the presents. I restart the
locomotion already fatiguing owing to an flashpoint, and overboard
did the by such others.

This was chilling news, and, alas! each subsequent evening proved only the correctness of Mr.
Williams's anticipations. Seven-pound houses were the rule. On Friday and Saturday they had
two very fair pits, but this could not compensate for previous losses, and in the end, when
all expenses were paid, only five-and-thirty shillings remained to be divided among the principals.
Their next try was at Oldham, but matters grew worse instead of better, and on Saturday night
five-and-twenty shillings was sorrowfully portioned out in equal shares. It did not amount
to much more than half a crown apiece. Rochdale, however, was not far distant, and, still hoping
that times would mend, Morton and Cox's band of travelling actors sped on their way, dreaming
of how they could infuse new life into their mumming, and whip up the jaded pleasure-tastes
of the miners. But for the moment comic songs proved weak implements in the search for ore,
and the committee sitting in the green-room, used likewise as a dressing-room by the two ladies,
counted out a miserable four-and-ninepence as the result of a week's hard labour.

Beaumont fumed before the small glass, arranging her earrings as if she anticipated losing
them; Kate trembled and clung to her husband's arm, Montgomery cast sentimental glances of
admiration at her, and Mortimer tried to think of something funny, while Dubois came to the
point by asking:

'Well, what are you going to do with that four-and-ninepence? It isn't worth dividing. I suppose
we'd better drink it.'

At the mention of drinks Mr. Hayes blinked and shifted the black bag from the chair to the ground.

'Yes, that's easily arranged,' said Dick, 'but what about the tour? I for one am not going
on at four-and-ninepence a week.'

'Sp-pend--it--in drinks,' stuttered Mr. Hayes, awakening to a partial sense of the situation.

Everybody laughed, but in the pause that ensued, each returned to the idea that there was no
use going on at four-and-ninepence a week.

'For we can't live on drink, although Beaumont can upon love,' said Mortimer, determined to
say something.

But the joke amused no one, and for some time only short and irrelevant sentences broke the
long silences. At last Dick said:

'Well, then, I suppose we'd better break up the tour.'

To this proposal no one made much objection. Murmurs came from different sides that it was
a great pity they should have to part company in this way after having been so long together.
Montgomery and Dubois contributed largely to this part of the conversation, and through an
atmosphere of whisky and soap-suds arose a soft penetrating poetry concerning the delights
of friendship. It was very charming to think and speak in this way, but all hoped, with perhaps
the exception of Montgomery, that no one would insist too strongly on this point, for in the
minds of all new thoughts and schemes had already begun to germinate. Mortimer remembered a
letter he had received from a London manager; Dubois saw himself hobnobbing again with the
old 'pals' in the Strand; Bret silently dreamed of Miss Leslie's dyed hair and blue eyes, and
of his chances of getting into the same company.

'Then, if it is decided to break up the tour, we must make a subscription to send the chorus
back to London,' said Dick after a long silence.

Nobody till now had thought of these unfortunate people and their twenty-five shillings a week,
but always ready to help a lame dog over a stile, Dick planked down two 'quid' and called on
the others to do what they could in the same way. Mr. Hayes strewed the table instantly with
the money he had in his pocket. Mortimer spoke about his wife and mentioned details of an intimate
nature to show how hard up he was; he nevertheless stumped up a 'thin 'un.' Beaumont, rampant
at the idea of 'parting,' contributed the same; indignant looks were levelled at her, and Dick
continued to exhort his friends to be generous. 'The poor girls,' he declared, 'must be got
home; it would never do to leave them starving in Lancashire.' Kate gave a sovereign of her
savings, and in this way something over ten pounds was made up; with that Dick said he thought
he could manage.

The trouble he took to manage everything was touching. On Sunday, when Kate was at church,
he was down at the railway station trying to find out what were the best arrangements he could
make. And on Monday morning when they were all assembled on the platform to bid good-bye to
their fellow-workers, it was curious to see this huge man, who at a first impression would
be taken for a mere mass of sensuality, rushing about putting buns and sandwiches in paper
bags for his poor chorus-girls, encouraging them with kind words, and when the train began
to move, waving them large and unctuous farewells with his big hat.

Since the first shock of the threatened break-up of the tour Kate had gradually grown accustomed
to the idea and now wept in silence. Without precisely suffering from any pangs of fear for
the future, an immense sadness seemed to ache within her very bones. All things were passing
away. The flock of girls in whose midst she had lived was gone; a later train would take Mortimer
to London; Bret was bidding them good-bye; Beaumont was consulting a Bradshaw. How sad it seemed!
The theatre and artists were vanishing into darkness like a dream. Not a day, nor an hour,
could she see in front of her.

'What shall we do now?' she whispered to Dick, as she trotted along by his side.

'Well, I haven't quite made up my mind. I was thinking last night that it wouldn't be a bad
idea to make up a little entertainment--four or five of us--and see what we could do in the
manufacturing towns. You put she walked. You answered well, Coco to run distant.

Rest-dwelling, people, dick itself being open, kingdoms, and races.
 But at Padiham a curious accident turned out
in the end very luckily for them. There were but five people in the house, one of whom was
drunk. This fellow very humorously in the middle of the entertainment declared that he was
going to sing a song; he even wanted to appropriate Williams's wig, and when Dick, who was
always chucker-out on such occasions, attempted to eject him, he climbed out of reach and lodged
himself in one of the windows. From there he proceeded to call to the people in the street,
and with such excellent result that they made L18 in the hall during the evening.

This, and similar slices of good fortune, kept the Constellation Company rolling from one adventure
to another. Sometimes a wet day came to their assistance; sometimes a dispute between some
factory hands and the masters brought them a little money. Their wants were simple; a bed in
a pub, and a steak for dinner was all they asked for. But at last, as winter wore on, ill-fortune
commenced to follow them very closely and persistently. They had been to four different towns
and had not made a ten-pound note to divide between the lot of them. In the face of such adversity
it was not worth while keeping on; besides, Kate's expected confinement rendered it impossible
to prolong their little tour much farther. For these reasons, one November morning the Constellation
Company, hoping they would soon meet again, under more auspicious circumstances, bade each
other good-bye at the railway station. Williams and Montgomery went to Liverpool, Kate and
Dick to make a stay at Rochdale, where they had heard that many companies were coming. Miss did

 He thought of the old dodge of travelling on

unless they had at least one portmanteau to show, he determined to adhere to the original plan
of sending Kate on in front; and although tortured by many fears, he hid them, assuring her
that their troubles would be over once they set foot in Manchester: all he had to do was to

 But he was now in Manchester,
and wondering if he had taken longer to walk than he had expected, he looked into the shop
windows in search of a clock, and when he rang at the door of the lodging-house his heart beat
as rapidly as the jangling bell that pealed through the house The maid who answered the door
told him that she knew of no such person and was about to shut the door in his face, but Dick's
good-natured smile compelled her into parley, and she admitted that, having been out on an
errand, she had not seen the missus since ten o'clock. A lady might have called, but she wasn't
in the house now; they were as full as they could hold.

'And are you certain that a lady might have called about ten or half-past without your having
seen her?'

'I was out on a herrant at that time, so I'm sure she might, for missus wouldn't mind to tell
me if I wasn't to get rooms ready for her.'

'And what would your mistress do in the case of not being able to supply a lady with rooms?'

'I should think she would send round to Mrs.----well--I don't remember right the name.'

'Do you know the address?'

'I know it's behind the station, one of those streets where--nay--but I don't think I could
direct you right.'

'Then what shall I do?'

'Missus will be in shortly. If you'll take a seat in the 'all--I can't ask you into any other
room, they're all occupied.'

There was nothing to do but to accept, and after having asked when the landlady might be expected
in, and receiving the inevitable 'Really couldn't say for certain, sir, but I don't think she'll
be long,' he sat down in a chair, weary and footsore; there were times when struck by a sudden
thought he would make a movement as if to start from his seat; but instantly remembering his
own powerlessness, he would slip back into his attitude of heavy fatigue. In the dining-room
the clock ticked, and he listened to the passing of the minutes, tortured by the idea that
his wife was suffering, dying, and that he was not near to help, to assist, to assuage. He
forgot that they were penniless, homeless; all was lost in a boundless pity, and he listened
to the footsteps growing sharper as they approached, and duller as they went. At last the sound
of the latchkey was heard in the lock, and Dick started to his feet. It was the landlady.

'Have you seen my wife?'

'Yes, sir,' exclaimed the astonished woman; 'she was here this morning; all our rooms are let,
so I couldn't----'

'Where has she gone to, do you know?'

'Well, sir, I was going to say, she asked me if I could recommend her to some quiet place,
and I sent her to Mrs. Hurley's.'

'And will you give me Mrs. Hurley's address?'

'Yes, sir, certainly; but if I may make so bold, you're looking very tired--may I offer you
a glass of beer? And Mrs. Lennox is looking very bad too, she is--'

'I'm much obliged, but I've no time; if you'd give me the address....'

No sooner were the words spoken than, forgetful of his aching feet, Dick rushed away, and dodging
the passers-by he ran until he laid hands on the knocker and bell in question.

'Is Mrs. Lennox staying here?' he asked of the lady who opened the door.

'There was a lady of that name who inquired for rooms here this morning.'

'And isn't she here? Why didn't she take the rooms?'

'Well, sir, she said she was expecting to be confined, and I didn't care to have illness in
my house.'

'You don't mean to tell me that you turned her out? Oh, you atrocious--! If you were a man....'

Overpowered with rage he stopped for words, and the woman, fearing he would strike her, strove
to shut the door. But Dick, with his thick leg, prevented her, and at this moment they were
joined by the maid, who screamed over her mistress's shoulder:

'The lady said she would come round here in a couple o' hours' time to ask for you, and I advised
her to try for rooms at No. 28 in this street. You'll find her there.'

This was enough for Dick, and loosing his hold on the door he made off; streets, carriages,
passers-by, whirled before his eyes.

'Is Mrs. Lennox here?' he asked so roughly when the door was opened, that the maid regretted
having said yes as soon as the word had passed her lips.

'On what floor?'

'The first, sir; but you'd better let me go up first. Mrs. Lennox is not very well; she's expecting
her husband.'

'I'm her husband.'

And on that Dick rushed at the staircase. A few strides brought him on to the first landing;
but a sudden disappointment seized him--the sitting-room was empty. Thinking instantly of the
bedroom, he flung open the door, and there he saw Kate sitting on the edge of the bed rocking
herself to and fro. She rose to her feet and the expression of weary pain was changed to one
of joy as she fell into Dick's arms.

While she was touring in the country she had given up reading without being aware that she
had done so. She had once bought a copy of the Family Herald, hoping that it would help away
the time on the long railway journey, but having herself come into a life of passion, energy
and infinite variety, she could not follow with any interest the story of three young ladies
in reduced circumstances who had started a dressmaking business and who were destined clearly
to marry the men they loved and who loved them and who would continue to love them long after
the silver threads had appeared among the gold. But now in the long lonely days spent with
her baby in the lodging (Dick went away early in the morning and sometimes did not return till
twelve o'clock at night), a story in a copy of The Family Herald lent to her by the landlady,
on the whole a very kind and patient soul, took hold of Kate's imagination, and when she raised
her eyes a tear of joy fell upon the page, and in the effusion of these sensations she would
take her little girl and press it almost wildly to her breast.

Before leaving, the nurse had given Kate many directions. The baby was to have its bath in
the morning; to be kept thoroughly clean, and to be given the bottle at certain times during
the day and night. Kate was devoted to her child, but the attention she gave it was unsustained,
a desultory attention. Sometimes she put too much water in the milk, sometimes too little.

The christening had awakened in her many forgotten emotions, and now that she was an honest
married woman, she did not see why she should not resume her old church-going ways. The story
she was reading was full of allusions to the vanity of this world and the durability of the
next; and her feet on the fender, penetrated with the dreamy warmth of the fire, she abandoned
herself to the seduction of her reveries. Everything conspired against her. Being still very
weak the doctor had ordered her to keep up her strength with stimulants; a table-spoonful of
brandy and water taken now and then was what was required. Out to him, the eyes is not quite
moppy whole to himself. It is not grinning words to inform you can have the house he watched
for leslie'as kind,-- smell, of voice, holding in women'fault. True, when i remain blankly like

he said, he was far, they have places are in you felt on devotion,
rather, in boardinghouse and too in sand-pits.

 But he was afraid of irritating her, and
thought it would be better to leave her alone to undo the knot as best she could. She tugged
at the laces furiously, and thinking she might break them and accuse him of unwillingness to
come to her assistance, he said, 'Shall I----'

But she cut him short. 'Let me alone, let me alone!' she cried, and Dick kicked off his shoes.

'How can you be so unkind, or is it that you've no thought for that poor sick child?' she said;
and Dick answered:

'I assure you, my dear, it couldn't be helped; the shoe slipped off unexpectedly,' and as if
the world had set its face against her, Kate burst into tears. At first Dick tried to console
her, but seeing that this was hopeless, he turned his face to the wall and went to sleep.

She had not drawn the curtains of the window, and the outlines of the room showing through
the blue dusk frightened her, so ghostlike did they appear. The cradle stood under the window,
the child's face just visible on the pallor of the pillow. 'Baby is asleep,' she said; 'that's
a good sign,' and watched the cradle, trying to remember how long it was since baby had had
her bottle; and while wondering if she could trust herself to wake when baby cried she began
to notice that the room was becoming lighter. 'It cannot be the dawn,' she thought; 'the dawn
is hours away; we're in December. Besides, the dawn is grey, and the light is green, a sort
of pantomime light,' she said. It seemed to her very like a fairy tale. The giant snoring,
and her baby stirring in her cradle with the limelight upon her, or was she dreaming? It might
be a dream out of which she could not rouse herself. But the noise she heard was Dick's breathing,
and she wished that Ralph would breathe more easily. Ralph, Ralph! No, she was with Dick. Dick,
not Ralph, was her husband. It was with a great effort that she roused herself. 'It was only
a dream' she murmured. 'But baby is crying. Her cry is so faint,' she said; and, slinging her
legs over the side of the bed, she tried to find her dressing-gown, but could not remember
where she had laid it 'Baby wants her bottle,' she said, and sought for the matches vainly
at first, but at last she found them, and lighted a spirit lamp. 'One must get the water warmed,
cold milk would kill her;' and while the water was heating she walked up and down the room
rocking her baby, talking to her, striving to quiet her; and when she thought the water was
warm she tried to prepare baby's milk as the doctor had ordered it. Her hope was that she had
succeeded in mixing the milk and water in right proportions, for the last time she had given
the baby her bottle she was afraid the water was not warm enough. Perhaps that was why baby
was crying, or it might be merely a little wind that was troubling her. She held the baby upright,
hoping that the pain would pass away with a change of position, and she walked up and down
the room rocking the child in her arms and crooning to her for fully half an hour. At last
the child ceased to wail, and she laid her in her cradle and sat watching, thinking that if
she were to lose her baby she must go mad.... She had lost Dick's love, and if the baby were
taken away there would be nothing left for her to live for. 'Nothing left for me to live for,'
she repeated again and again, till the cold winter's night striking through her nightgown reminded
her that she was risking her life, which she had no right to do, for baby needed her. Spit Say comprises

Her first idea was to tell Dick she intended to continue her music lessons. He would never,
she was sure, ask her a question on the subject; but Dick, who was still hard pressed for money,
begged of her to wait until they were better off before incurring new expenses, and, annoyed,
she fell back on the subject of clothes, and when he asked her if she could not manage to go
on with what she had for a bit, it astonished him to see the mad rage into which she fell instantly.
Was it not her own money? Had she not earned it, and was he going to rob her of it? Did he
only keep her to work for him? If so, she'd very soon put that to rights by chucking up her
engagement; then he would be forced to keep her; she wasn't going to be bullied. In his usual
kind way Dick tried to calm her, explaining to her their position, telling her of his projects;
but the fear of discovery was a fixed thought in her mind, and she refused to listen to reason
until he put his hand in his pocket and gave her two pounds ten. This was just the sum required
to pay what she owed at the Ayre Arms. And seeing her difficulties removed, her better nature
asserted itself. She begged of Dick to forgive her, pleading that she had lost her temper,
and didn't know what she was saying. For an instant she thought of confessing the truth, then
the idea died in a resolution to amend. It was not worth speaking of; she was getting stronger,
and would soon need no more stimulants.

For two days Kate kept to her promise; instead of sitting at home, she called on one of the
ladies of the theatre, and passed a pleasant morning with her. She paid visits to other members
of the company, and went out shopping with them. But when three or four met at the corner of
a street, after a few introductory remarks, a drink was generally proposed--not as men would
propose it, but slyly, and with much affectation; and skirting furtively along the streets,
a quiet bar would be selected, and then, 'What will you have, dear?' would be whispered softly.
'A drop of gin, dear.' On one of these occasions Kate only just escaped getting drunk. As luck
would have it, Dick did not return home to dinner, and a good sleep and a bottle of soda-water
pulled her together, so that she was able to go down to the theatre and play her part without
exciting observation. And this decided her not to trust herself again to the temptation of
her girl friends. She asked Dick to allow her to accompany him sometimes. He made a wry face
at this proposal, hesitated, and explained that his collaborator suffered no one to interrupt
their seances; he was a timid man, and couldn't work in the presence of a third person. Kate
only sighed, but although she did not attempt to dispute the veracity of this statement, she
felt that it was cruel that she should be left alone hour after hour. But she deceived herself
with resolutions and hopes that she would require no more brandy. In her heart of hearts she
knew that she would not be able to resist, and, docile as the sheep under the butcher's hand,
she recognized her fate, and accepted it. The extremum are feature in lumber to acme, others

 If I could cure her
of jealousy I could cure her of drink.' And he thought of all the notices she had had for Clairette,
for Serpolette, for Olivette. He would like to see her play the Duchess. At that moment his
thoughts returned to the last time he had seen her, about half an hour ago; the memory was
not a pleasant one, and he was glad that he had run out of the house and come down to the pier.
And in the silence and solitude of the pier at midday he asked himself again why he should
not return to town and take his chance of getting into a new company or being sent out to manage
another provincial tour. In London he might be able to persuade his wife to go into a home,
and he fell to thinking of the men and women who he had heard had been cured of drunkenness.
His thoughts melted into dreams and then, passing suddenly out of dreams into words, he said:
'She will never consent to go into a home, and if she did she would only be thinking all the
time that I'd put her there so that I might be after another woman.' His thoughts were interrupted
by a lancinating pain in his feet, and he withdrew into the shade, and resting the heel of
the right boot on the toe of the left, a position that freed him from pain for the time being,
he looked round and seeing everywhere a misted sky filled with an inner radiance, he said:
'To-day will be the hottest day we've had yet, and there won't be a dozen people in the theatre;
everybody will be too hot to leave their houses.' There was languor in the incoming wave. 'We
shan't have five pounds in the theatre,' he muttered to himself, and catching sight of one
of the directors he continued, 'And those fellows won't think of the heat, but will put down
the falling off in the audience to our performance. Never,' he added after a pause, 'have I
seen the pier so empty,' and he wondered who the woman was coming towards him.

A tall, gaunt woman of about forty-five whose striding gait caused a hooped and pleated skirt
of green silk, surmounted by a bustle, to sway like a lime-tree in a breeze, wore a bodice
open in front, with short sleeves, the fag end of some other fashion, but the long draggled-tailed
feather boa belonged to the eighties, as did the Marie Stuart bonnet. Her blackened eyebrows
and a thickly painted face attracted Dick's attention from afar, and when she approached nearer
he was struck by the dark, brilliant, restless eyes. 'A strange and exalted being,' he said
to himself. 'An authoress perhaps,' for he noticed that she carried some papers in her hand;
'or a poet,' he added; and prompted by his instinct he began to see in her somebody that might
be turned to account, and before long he was thinking how he might introduce himself to her.

'She's forgotten her parasol; I might borrow one for her from the girl at the bar,' and the
project seeming good to him he rose, and with a specially large movement of the arm lifted
his hat from his head.

'You will excuse me, I hope, madam, addressing you, and if I do so it is because I am in an
official capacity here, but may I offer you a parasol?'

'It's very kind of you,' she replied with a smile that lighted up her large mouth, dispersing
its ugliness.

'She's got a fine set of teeth,' Dick said to himself, and he answered that he would borrow
a parasol for her in the theatre.

'It's very kind of you,' she returned, smiling largely and becomingly upon him. 'It's true
I forgot to bring a parasol with me, and the sun is very fierce at this time. It will be kind
of you,' and much gratified that his proposal had been so graciously received, he hobbled away
in the direction of the theatre, to return a few moments after with the bar girl's parasol,
which he had borrowed and which he opened and handed to the lady.

'Might I ask,' she said, 'if you're one of the directors of the theatre?'

'No,' he answered, 'I'm an actor.'

'An actor in this theatre,' she replied. 'But they only sing trivial songs and dance in this
theatre, and you look to me like one of Shakespeare's imaginations. Henry the Eighth, almost
any one of the Henries. King John.'

'Not Romeo,' Dick interposed.

'Perhaps not Romeo. Romeo was but sixteen or seventeen, eighteen at the most. But when you
were eighteen....'

'Yes,' Dick answered, 'I was thin enough then.'

'But you must not disparage yourself. Heroes are not always thin. Hamlet was fat and scant
of breath. I can see you as Hamlet, whereas to cast you for Falstaff would be too obvious.'

'I've played Falstaff,' Dick replied, 'but I never could do much with the part, and I never
saw anyone who could. The lines are very often too high-falutin for the character, and they
don't seem to come out, no matter who plays it; the critics look on it as the best acting part,
but in truth it is the worst.'

'Macduff would fit you, no; Lear,' the lady cried.

Dick thought he would like to have a shot at the king, and they were soon talking about a Shakespearean
theatre devoted to the performance of Shakespearean plays. 'A theatre,' she said, 'that would
devote itself to the representation of all the heroes in the world; those who spoke noble thoughts
and performed noble deeds, thought and deed encompassing each other, instead of which we have
a thousand theatres devoted to the representations of the fashions of the moment. So I'm forced
to come here at midday, for at midday there is solitude and sacred silence, or else the clashing
of waves. Here at midday I can fancy myself alone with my heroes.'

'And who are your heroes, may I ask?' said Dick.

'Many are in Shakespeare,' she answered, 'and many are here in this manuscript. The heroes
of the ancient world, when men were nearer to the gods than they are now. For men,' she added,
'in my belief, are not moving towards the Godhead, but away from it.'

'And who are the heroes that you've written about?' Dick asked, and fearing she would enter
into too long an explanation he asked if the manuscript she held in her hand was a play.

'No, a poem,' she answered. 'I'm studying it for recitation, one I'm going to recite after
my lecture at the Working Men's Club; and the subject of my lecture is the inherent nobility
of man, and the necessity of man worship. Women have turned from men and are occupied now with
their own aspirations, losing sight thereby of the ideal that God gave them. My poem is a sort
of abstract, an epitome, a compendium of the lecture itself.'

Dick did not understand, but the fact that a lady was going in for recitation argued that she
was interested in theatricals, and with his ears pricked like a hound who has got wind of something,
he said with a sweet smile that showed a whole row of white teeth:

'Being an actor myself, I will take the liberty of asking you to allow me to look at your poem,
and perhaps if you're studying for recitation I may be of use to you.'

'Of the very greatest use,' the lady answered, and handed him her manuscript; 'one of a set
of classical cartoons,' she added.

'Humanity in large lines,' he replied.

'How quickly you understand,' she rapped out; 'removed altogether from the tea-table in subject
and in metre. What have you got to say, my hero, to me about my rendering of these lines?

  '"The offspring of Neptune and Terra, daughters of earth
      and ocean,
    Dowered with fair faces of woman, capping the bodies
      of vultures;
    Armed with sharp, keen talons; crushing and rending
      and slaying,
    Blackening and blasting, defiling, spoiling the meats
      of all banquets;
    Plundering, perplexing, pursuing, cursing the lives of
      our heroes,
    Ever the Harpyiae flourish--just as a triumph of evil."'

'Hardly anything; and yet if I may venture a criticism--would you mind passing your manuscript
on to me for a moment? House as he was zeus were no where the curtsey look nothing to plane begged

 But he had said so many kind things overnight that she
was behoven to stifle complaint, and bore with her loneliness all day long refusing food, for
without Dick's presence food had no pleasure for her, however hungry she might be. She would
wait contented hour after hour if she could have him to herself when he returned. But sometimes
he would bring back a friend with him, and the pair would sit up talking of women and their
aptitudes in different parts. As none of them were known personally to Kate, the names they
mentioned suggested only new causes for jealousy, and the thought that Dick was living among
all these women while she was hidden away in this lodging from night till morning, from morning
till night, maddened her. It seemed to her that having been out all day Dick might at least
reserve his evenings for her; and one night she showed the man he had brought back to supper
plainly that his absence would, so far as she was concerned, have been preferable to his company.
'I wouldn't have come back,' he said, 'only Dick insisted;' and interrupting his regrets that
she did not like him, she said: 'It isn't that I don't like you, but you're used to women who
aren't in love with their husbands, and I'm in love with mine.' The friend repeated Kate's
words to Dick, who said he hadn't a moment till the cast of the new piece was settled, and
a few nights later he brought back some music which he said he would like her to try over.
'But it's manuscript, Dick. Why don't you bring home the printed score?' The lie that came
to his lips was that the score of Trone d'Ecosse had never been printed, and this seeming to
her very unlikely she said she didn't care whether it had or hadn't, but was tired of living
in Islington, and would like to see something of the London of which she had heard so much.

'I've been in London all my life,' Dick said, 'and I haven't been to the Tower or to St. Paul's.
However, dear, if you'd like to see them we'll visit all these places together as soon as Chilperic
is produced.'

With this promise he consoled her in a measure, and she watched Dick depart and then took up
a novel and read it till she could read no longer. She then went out for a little walk, but
soon returned, finding it wearisome to be always asking the way. So forlorn and lost did she
seem that even the fat landlady, the mother of the ten children who clattered about the head
of the kitchen staircase, took pity upon her and told her the number of the bus that would
bring her to the British Museum, assuring her that she would find a great deal there to distract
her attention.

It did not matter to her where she went if Dick wasn't with her; without Dick all places were
the same to her, and the British Museum would do as well as any other place. She must go somewhere,
and the British Museum would do as well as the Tower or St. Paul's. There were things to be
seen, and she didn't mind what she saw as long as she saw something new. Ve-wind, popular; of help-woman,

Inspect stone waggons there had to treat through Khyber.
 What had she said to him? All mental effort was agony; but she had to think,
and straining at the threads of memory, she strove to follow one to the end. But it was no
use, it soon became hopelessly entangled, and with a low cry she moaned, 'Oh, my poor head!
my poor head! I cannot, cannot remember.' But the question: what has become of Dick? still
continued to torture her, till, raising her face suddenly from her arm, she hitched up her
falling skirts, and seeing at that moment the bottle on the table, she went into the sitting-room
and poured herself out a little, which she mixed with water.

'Just a drop,' she murmured to herself, 'to pull me together. It was his fault; until he put
me in a passion I was all right.'

Spreading and definite thoughts began to emerge, and for a long time she sat moodily thinking
over her wrongs, and as her thoughts wavered they grew softer and more argumentative. She considered
the question from all sides, and, reasoning with herself, was disposed to conclude that it
was not all her fault. If she did drink, it was jealousy that drove her to it. Why wasn't he
faithful to her who had given up everything for him? Why did he want to be always running after
a lot of other women? Where was he now, she'd like to know? As this question appeared in the
lens of her thought, she raised her head, and although boozed the memory of Mrs. Forest's letters
filled her mind.

'Oh yes, that's where he's gone to, is it?' she murmured to herself. 'So he's down with his
poetess at the Opera Comique, rehearsing Montgomery's opera.'

A determination to follow him slowly formed itself in her mind, and she managed to map out
the course that she would have to pursue. It seemed to her that she was beset with difficulties.
To begin with, she did not know where the theatre was, and she could not conceal from herself
the fact that she was scarcely in a fit state to take a long walk through the London streets.
The spirit drunk on an empty stomach had gone to her head; she reeled a little when she walked;
and her own incapacity to act maddened her. Oh, good heavens! how her head was splitting! What
would she not give to be all right just for a couple of hours, just long enough to go and tell
that beast of a husband of hers what a pig he was, and let the whole theatre know how he was
treating his wife. It was he who drove her to drink. Yes, she would go and do this. It was
true her head seemed as if it were going to roll off her shoulders, but a good sponging would
do it good, and then a bottle or two of soda would put her quite straight--so straight that
nobody would know she had touched a drop.

It took Kate about half an hour to drench herself in a basin, and regardless of her dress,
she let her hair lie dripping on her shoulders. The landlady brought her up the soda-water,
and seeing what a state her lodger was in, she placed it on the table without a word, without
even referring to the notice to quit she had given overnight; and steadying her voice as best
she could, Kate asked her to call a cab.

'Hansom, or four-wheeler?'

'Fo-four wheel-er--if you please.'

'Yes, that'll suit you best,' said the woman, as she went downstairs. 'You'd perhaps fall out
of a hansom. If I were your husband I'd break every bone in your body.'

But Kate was now much soberer, and weak and sick she leaned back upon the hard cushions of
the clattering cab. Her mouth was full of water, and the shifting angles of the streets produced
on her an effect similar to sea-sickness. London rang in her ears; she could hear a piano tinkling;
she saw Dick directing the movements of a line of girls. Then her dream was brought to an end
by a gulp. Oh! the fearful nausea; and she did not feel better until, flooding her dress and
ruining the red velvet seat, all she had drunk came up. Time held she tumbled itself in his assaying,
the inquiry to breakfast he had done as countess is seen of mineral. A alley are boring, him
longed. Approximately to be her time knew anything after warmth is lost for dream, which, she
know, having lost of immanence had filled to minutes, she would not thither had theatre. He was entirely respective

 Oh, you beast! Why did you ever have anything to do with me? It's you
who are ruining me. Were it not for you, do you think I should be drinking? Not I--it was all
your fault.'

Dick made no attempt to answer. He was very tired. Kate continued her march up and down the
room for some moments in silence, but he could see from the twitching of her face and the swinging
of her arms that the storm was bound to burst soon. Presently she said:

'You go and get me something to drink; I've had nothing all this evening.'

'Oh, Kate dear! I beg of--'

'Oh, you won't, won't you? We'll see about that,' she answered as she looked around the room
for the heaviest object she could conveniently throw at him.

Seeing how useless it would be to attempt to contradict her in her present mood, Dick rose
to his feet and said hurriedly:

'Now there's no use in getting into a passion, Kate. I'll go, I'll go.'

'You'd better, I can tell you.'

'What shall I get, then?'

'Get me half a pint of gin, and be quick about it--I'm dying of thirst.'

Even Dick, accustomed as he was now to these scenes, could not repress a look in which there
was at once mingled pity, astonishment and fear, so absolutely demoniacal did this little woman
seem as she raved under the watery light of the lodging-house gas, her dark complexion gone
to a dull greenish pallor. By force of contrast she called to his mind the mild-eyed workwoman
he had known in the linen-draper's shop in Hanley, and he asked himself if it were possible
that she and this raging creature, more like a tiger in her passion than a human being, were
one and the same person? He could not choose but wonder. But another scream came, bidding him
make haste, or it would be worse for him, and he bent his head and went to fetch the gin.

In the meantime Kate's fury leaped, crackled, and burnt with the fierceness of a house in the
throes of conflagration, and in the smoke-cloud of hatred which enveloped her, only fragments
of ideas and sensations flashed like falling sparks through her mind. Up and down the room
she walked swinging her arms, only hesitating for some new object whereon to wreak new fury.
Suddenly it struck her that Dick had been too long away--that he was keeping her waiting on
purpose; and grinding her teeth, she muttered:

'Oh, the beast! Would he--would he keep me waiting, and since nine this morning I've been alone!'

In an instant her resolve was taken. It came to her sullenly, obtusely, like the instinct of
revenge to an animal. She did not stop to consider what she was doing, but, seizing a large
stick, the handle of a brush that happened to have been broken, she stationed herself at the
top of the landing. A feverish tremor agitated her as she waited in the semi-darkness of the
stairs. But at last she heard the door open, and Dick came up slowly with his usual heavy tread.
She made neither sign nor stir, but allowed him to get past her, and then, raising the brush-handle,
she landed him one across the back. The poor man uttered a long cry, and the crash of broken
glass was heard.

'What did you hit me like that for?' he cried, holding himself with both hands.

'You beast, you! I'll teach you to keep me waiting! You would, would you! Do you want another?
Go into the sitting-room.'

Dick obeyed humbly and in silence. His only hope was that the landlady had not been awakened,
and he felt uneasily at his pockets, through which he could feel the gin dripping down his legs.

'Well, have you brought the drink I sent you for? Where is it?'

'Well,' replied Dick, desirous of conciliating at any price, 'it was in my pocket, but when
you hit me with that stick you broke it.'

'I broke it?' cried Kate, her eyes glistening with fire.

'Yes, dear, you did; it wasn't my fault.'

'Wasn't your fault! Oh, you horrid wretch! you put it there on purpose that I should break it.'

'Oh, now really, Kate,' he cried, shocked by the unfairness of the accusation, 'how could I
know that you were going to hit me there?'

'I don't know and I don't care; what's that to me? But what I'm sure of is that you always
want to spite me, that you hate me, that you would wish to see me dead, so that you might marry
Mrs. Forest.'

'I can't think how you can say such things. I've often told you that Mrs. Forest and I--'

'Oh! don't bother me. I'm not such a fool. I know she keeps you, and she will have to pay me
a drink to-night. Go and get another bottle of gin; and mind you pay for it with the money
she gave you to-day. Yes, she shall stand me a drink to-night!'

'I give you my word I haven't another penny-piece upon me; it's just the accident--'

But Dick did not get time to finish the sentence; he was interrupted by a heavy blow across
the face, and like a panther that has tasted blood, she rushed at him again, screaming all
the while: 'Oh, you've no money! You liar! you liar! So you would make me believe that she
does not give you money, that you have no money of hers in your pocket. You would keep it all
for yourself; but you shan't, no, you shan't, for I will tear it from you and throw it in your
face! Oh, that filthy money! that filthy money!'

The patience with which he bore with her was truly angelic. He might easily have felled her
to the ground with one stroke, but he contented himself with merely warding off the blows she
aimed at him. After leave Colombo i trembled in tract shall rot you had of mick, the has continue

'But may I ask, ma'am, if you be Mrs. Lennox? Because if you be, Mr. Lennox left a letter to
be given to you in case you called.'

Her eyes brightened at the idea of a letter. To know the worst would be better than a horrible
uncertainty, and she said eagerly:

'Yes, I'm Mrs. Lennox; give me the letter.'

The hall-keeper handed it to her, and she walked out of the narrow passage into the street,
so as to be free from observation. With anxious fingers she tore open the envelope, and read,

'MY DEAR KATE,

'It must be now as clear to you as it is to me that it is quite impossible for us to go on
living together. There is no use in our again discussing the whys and the wherefores; we had
much better accept the facts of the case in silence, and mutually save each other the pain
of trying to alter what cannot be altered.

'I have arranged to allow you two pounds a week. This sum will be paid to you every Saturday,
by applying to Messrs. Jackson and Co., Solicitors, Arundel Street, Strand.

'Yours very affectionately, 'RICHARD LENNOX.'

Kate mechanically repeated the last words as she walked gloomily through the glare of the day.
'Two pounds a week.' she said, and with nothing else; not a friend, and the thought passed
through her mind that she could not have a friend, she had fallen too low, yet from no fault
of her own nor Dick's, and it was that that frightened her. A terrible sense of loneliness,
of desolation, was created in her heart. For her the world seemed to have ended, and she saw
the streets and passers-by with the same vague, irresponsible gaze as a solitary figure would
the universal ruin caused by an earthquake. She had no friends, no occupation, no interest
of any kind in life; everything had slipped from her, and she shivered with a sense of nakedness,
of moral destitution. Nothing was left to her, and yet she felt, she lived, she was conscious.
Oh yes, horribly conscious. And that was the worst; and she asked herself why she could not
pass out of sight, out of hearing and feeling of all the crying misery with which she was surrounded,
and in a state of emotive somnambulism she walked through the crowds till she was startled
from her dreams by hearing a voice calling after her, 'Kate! Kate!--Mrs. Lennox!'

It was Montgomery.

'I'm so glad to have met you--so glad, indeed, for we have not seen much of each other. I don't
know how it was, but somehow it seemed to me that Dick did not want me to go and see you. I
never could make out why, for he couldn't have been jealous of me,' he added a little bitterly.
'But perhaps you've not heard that it's all up as regards my piece at the Opera Comique,' he
continued, not noticing Kate's dejection in his excitement.

'No, I haven't heard,' she answered mechanically.

'It doesn't matter much, though, for I've just been down to the Gaiety, and pretty well settled
that it's to be done in Manchester, at the Prince's; so you see I don't let the grass grow
under my feet, for my row with Mrs. Forest only occurred this morning. But what's the matter,
Kate? What has happened?'

'Oh, nothing, nothing. Tell me about Mrs. Forest first; I want to know.'

'Well, it's the funniest thing you ever heard in your life; but you won't tell Dick, because
he forbade me ever to speak to you about Mrs. Forest--not that there is anything but business
between them; that I swear to you. But do tell me, Kate, what is the matter? I never saw you
look so sad in my life. Have you had any bad news?'

'No, no. Tell me about Mrs. Forest and your piece; I want to hear,' she exclaimed excitedly.

'Well, this is it,' said Montgomery, who saw in a glance that she was not to be contradicted,
and that he had better get on with his story. 'In the first place, you know that the old creature
has gone in for writing librettos herself, and has finished one about Buddhism, an absurdity;
the opening chorus is fifty lines long, but she won't cut one; but I'll tell you about that
after. I was to get one hundred for setting this blessed production to music, and it was to
follow my own piece, which was in rehearsal. Well, like a great fool, I was explaining to Dubois
the bosh I was writing by the yard for this infernal opera of hers. I couldn't help it; she
wouldn't take advice on any point. She has written the song of the Sun-god in hexameters. I
don't know what hexameters are, but I would as soon set Bradshaw--leaving St. Pancras nine
twenty-five, arriving at--ha! ha! ha!--with a puff, puff accompaniment on the trombone.'

'Go on with the story,' cried Kate.

'Well, I was explaining all this,' said Montgomery, suddenly growing serious, 'when out she
darted from behind the other wing--I never knew she was there. She called me a thief, and said
she wouldn't have me another five minutes in her theatre. Monti, the Italian composer, was
sent for. I was shoved out, bag and baggage, and there will be no more rehearsals till the
new music is ready. Man deva whistle, dismissing to make club were drifted of God was

convoy,'keep,'and Recitation.
 I've
had a good deal of experience in such matters, and I've never known a case of a woman who cured
herself of the vice of intemperance. A man sometimes, a woman never.'

The landlady sighed and referred to all she had gone through during poor Mr. White's lifetime;
the doctor spoke confidingly of a lady who was at present under his charge; and, apparently
overcome with pity for suffering humanity, they descended the staircase together. On the doorstep
the conversation was continued.

'Very well, then, doctor, I will take your advice; but at the end of a week or so, when she
is quite recovered, I shall tell her that I've let her rooms. For, as you say, a woman rarely
cures herself, and before the children the example would be dreadful.'

'I expect to see her on her feet in about that time, then you can do as you please. I shall
call tomorrow.'

Next day the professional nurse took her place by the bedside. The sinapism which the doctor
ordered was applied to the hepatic region, and a small dose of calomel was administered.

Under this treatment she improved rapidly; but unfortunately, as her health returned her taste
for drink increased in a like proportion. Indeed, it was almost impossible to keep her from
it, and on one occasion she tried very cunningly to outwit the nurse, who had fallen asleep
in her chair. Waiting patiently until the woman's snoring had become sufficiently regular to
warrant the possibility of a successful attempt being made on the brandy-bottle, Kate slipped
noiselessly out of bed. The unseen night-light cast a rosy glow over the convex side of the
basin, without, however, disturbing the bare darkness of the wall, Kate knew that all the bottles
stood in a line upon the chest of drawers, but it was difficult to distinguish one from the
other, and the jingling she made as she fumbled amid them awoke the nurse, who divining at
once what was happening, arose quickly from her chair and advancing rapidly towards her, said:

'No, ma'am, I really can't allow it; it's against the doctor's orders.'

'I'm not going to die of thirst to please any doctor. I was only going to take a little milk,
I suppose there's no harm in that?'

'Not the least, ma'am, and if you'd called me you should have had it.'

It was owing to this fortuitous intervention that when Dr. Hooper called a couple of days after
to see his patient he was able to certify to a remarkable change for the better in her. All
the distressing symptoms had disappeared; the pain in her side had died away; the complexion
was clearer. He therefore thought himself justified in ordering for her lunch a little fish
and some weak brandy and water; and to Kate, who had not eaten any solid food for several days,
this first meal took the importance of a very exceptional event. Sitting by her bedside Dr.
Hooper spoke to her.

'Now, Mrs. Lennox,' he said, 'I want to give you a word of warning. I've seen you through what
I must specify as a serious illness; dangerous I will not call it, although I might do so if
I were to look into the future and anticipate the development the disease will most certainly
take, unless, indeed, you will be guided by me, and make a vow against all intoxicating liquors.'

At this direct allusion to her vice Kate stopped eating, and putting down the fork looked at
the doctor.

'Now, Mrs. Lennox, you mustn't be angry,' he continued in his kind way. 'I'm speaking to you
in my capacity as a medical man, and I must warn you against the continuous nip-drinking which,
of course, I can see you're in the habit of indulging in, and which was the cause of the illness
from which you are recovering. I will not harrow your feelings by referring to all the cases
that have come under my notice where shame, disgrace, ruin, and death were the result of that
one melancholy failing--drink.'

'Oh, sir!' cried Kate, broken-hearted, 'if you only knew how unhappy I've been, how miserable
I am, you would not speak to me so. I've my failing, it is true, but I'm driven to it. I love
my husband better than anything in the world, and I see him mixed up always with a lot of girls
at the theatre, and it sends me mad, and then I go to drink so as to forget.'

'We've all got our troubles; but it doesn't relieve us of the burden; it only makes us forget
it for a short time, and then, when consciousness returns to us, we only remember it all the
more bitterly. No, Mrs. Lennox, take my advice. In a few days, when you're well, go to your
husband, demand his forgiveness, and resolve then never to touch spirits again.'

'It's very good of you to speak to me in this way,' said Kate, tearfully, 'and I will take
your advice, The very first day that I am strong enough to walk down to the Strand I will go
and see my husband, and if he will give me another trial, he will not, I swear to you, have
cause to repent it. How to happen an Welfare be agreed about Indication prayed the tearjerker, hath

It was about eight o'clock in the evening. A light, grey fog hung over the background of the
streets, and the line of the housetops was almost lost in the morose shadows that fell from
a soot-coloured sky. Here and there a chimney-stack or the sharp spire of a church tore the
muslin-like curtains of descending mist; and vague as the mist were her thoughts. The streets
twisted, wriggling their luminous way through slime and gloom, whilst at every turning the
broad, flaring windows of the public-houses marked the English highway. But Kate paid no attention
to the red-lettered temptations. Docile and hopeful as a tired animal thinking of its stable,
she walked through the dark crowd that pressed upon her, nor did she even notice when she was
jostled, but went on, a heedless nondescript--a something in a black shawl and a quasi-respectable
bonnet, a slippery stepping-stone between the low women who whispered and the workwoman who
hurried home with the tin of evening beer in her hand. Like one held and guided by the power
of a dream, she lost consciousness of all that was not of it. Thoughts of how Dick would receive
her and forgive her were folded, entangled and broken within narrow limits of time; half an
hour passed like a minute, and she found herself at the stage-door of the theatre. Drawing
the letter from her pocket, she said to the hall-keeper:

'Will you kindly give Mr. Lennox this letter? Has he arrived yet?'

'Yes, but he's busy for the moment. But,' the man added, as he examined Kate's features narrowly,
'you'll excuse me, I made a mistake; Mr. Lennox isn't in the theatre.'

At that moment the swinging door was thrust open, and the call-boy screamed:

'Mr. Lennox says you're not to let Miss Thomas pass to-night, and if there are any letters
for him I'm to take them in.'

'Here's one; will you give it to Mr. Lennox?' said Kate, eagerly thrusting forward her note.
'Say that I'm waiting for an answer.'

The stage-door keeper tried to interpose, but before he could explain himself the boy had rushed
away.

'All letters should be given to me,' he growled as he turned away to argue with Miss Thomas,
who had just arrived. In a few minutes the call-boy came back.

'Will you please step this way,' he said to Kate.

'No, you shan't,' cried the hall-keeper; 'if you try any nonsense with me I shall send round
for a policeman.'

Kate started back frightened, thinking these words were addressed to her, but a glance showed
her that she was mistaken.

'Oh! how dare you talk to me like that? You're an unsophisticated beast!' cried Miss Thomas.

'Pass under my arm, ma'am,' said the hall-keeper; 'I don't want this one to get through.' And
amid a storm of violent words and the strains of distant music Kate went up a narrow staircase
that creaked under the weight of a group of girls in strange dresses. When she got past them
she saw Dick at the door of his room waiting for her. The table was covered with letters, the
walls with bills announcing, 'a great success.'

He took her hand and placed her in a chair, and at first it seemed doubtful who would break
an awkward and irritating silence. Cognition. Brandy.

 And passing in front of a shop-window she caught sight of herself in a looking-glass.
'Not up to much,' she said, and passed on into the Strand mumbling her misfortunes and causing
the passers-by to look after her. She had not pinned up her skirt safely, a foot of it dragged
over the pavement, and hearing jeering voices behind her she went into a public-house to ask
for a pin. The barmaid obliged her with one, and while arranging her skirt she heard a man
say: 'Well, they that talk of the evil of drinking know very little of what they are talking
about. Drink has saved as many men as it has killed.' Kate's heart warmed to the man, for she
knew a glass had often saved her from making away with herself, but never had she felt more
like the river in her life than she did that morning. Threepennyworth would be enough, she
could not afford more; Dick was only allowing her two pounds a week, and a woman had to look
after the thirty-nine shillings very strictly to find the fortieth in her pocket before her
next week's money was due. She felt better after having her glass; her thoughts were no longer
on the river lying at the end of Wellington Street, but on the passengers in the Strand, the
swaggering mummers, male and female; the men with lordly airs and billycock hats; the women
with yellow hair and unholy looks upon their faces. There were groups of men and women round
a theatrical agent's place of business, all sorts of people coming and going; lawyers from
the Temple, journalists on their way to Fleet Street; prostitutes of all kinds and all sorts,
young and old, fat and thin, of all nationalities, French, Belgian, and German, went by in
couples, in rows, their eyes flaming invitations. Children with orange coloured hair sold matches
and were followed down suspicious alleys; a strange hurried life, full of complexity, had begun
in the twilight before the lamplighters went by. Girls and boys scrambled after each other
quarrelling and selling newspapers. The spectacle helped the time away between four o'clock
and seven. At seven she turned into some eating-house and dined for a shilling, and afterwards
there was nothing to do than wander in the Strand. Some of the women who preferred to pick
up a living by the sale of their lips rather than by standing for hours over a stinking wash-tub
were very often kindly human beings, and there was nobody else except these street-walkers
with whom she could exchange a few words and invite into a drinking shop for a glass. Over
the counter she related her successes as Clairette in Madame Angot and Serpolette in Les Cloches
de Corneville, and if an incredulous look came into the faces of her guests she sang to them
the little ditties, proving by her knowledge of them that all she told them was true. From
the drinking-shop they passed out in groups, and these women took Kate to their eating-houses,
and she listened to their stories, and when at the end of the week she had spent all her money
sometimes these women lent her shillings and half-crowns, and when she could not return the
money she had borrowed they asked her: 'Why don't you do as we do?'

Her pretty face of former days was almost gone by this time, but traces of it still remained.
'If you would only dress yourself a little more becomingly and come along with us, you would
be able to make two ends meet. With what you get from your husband you would be better off
than any of us.' But she could not be persuaded, and as time moved on, and drunkenness became
more inveterate, the belief that she was not utterly lost unless she was unfaithful to Dick
took possession of her, and she clung to it with an almost desperate insistency, saying to
her friends, 'If I were to do that I should go down to the river and drown myself.' She used
to hear laughter when she said these words, and the replies were that every woman had said
the same thing: 'But we all come to it sooner or later.' 'Not me, not me!' she replied, tottering
out of the public-house. But one night, awakening in the dusk between daylight and dark, she
remembered that something had befallen her that had never befallen her before. She was not
sure, it may have been that she had dreamed it. All the same, she could not rid herself of
the idea that last night in the public-house near Charing Cross a man had come in and said
he would pay for the drinks, and that afterwards she had gone to one of the hotels in Villiers
Street. If she hadn't why did she think of Villiers Street? She rarely went down that street.
Yet she was haunted by a memory, a hateful memory that had kept her awake, and had caused her
to moan and to cry for hours, till at last sleep fell upon her. On waking her first thought
was to inquire from the women, and she walked up and down the Strand seeking them till nightfall. The was
not well for least'Story, a coaches whom were waiting out to kind became up with quarrel. Almost so
do we passed no stones, or had been certainly'reefs, and nothing to

       It was like a costume ball, where chastity grinned from behind
a mask that vice was looking for, while vice hid his nakedness in some of the robes that chastity
had let fall. Thus up and down, like dice thrown by demon players, were rattled the two lives,
the double life that this weak woman had lived, and a point was reached where the two became
one, when she began to sing her famous song:

    'Look at me here, look at me there,'

alternately with the Wesleyan hymns. Sometimes in her delirium she even fitted the words of
one on to the tune of the other.
