OPPORTUNITIES IN ENGINEERING

ENGINEERING AND THE ENGINEER

Several years ago, at the regular annual meeting of one of the major engineering societies,
the president of the society, in the formal address with which he opened the meeting, gave
expression to a thought so startling that the few laymen who were seated in the auditorium
fairly gasped. What the president said in effect was that, since engineers had got the world
into war, it was the duty of engineers to get the world out of war. As a thought, it probably
reflected the secret opinion of every engineer present, for, however innocent of intended wrong-doing
engineers assuredly are as a group in their work of scientific investigation and development,
the statement that engineers were responsible for the conflict then raging in Europe was absolute
truth.

I mention this merely to bring to the reader's attention the tremendous power which engineers
wield in world affairs.

The profession of engineering--which, by the way, is merely the adapting of discoveries in
science and art to the uses of mankind--is a peculiarly isolated one. But very little is known
about it among those outside of the profession. Laymen know something about law, a little about
medicine, quite a lot--nowadays--about metaphysics. But laymen know nothing about engineering.
Indeed, a source of common amusement among engineers is the peculiar fact that the average
layman cannot differentiate between the man who runs a locomotive and the man who designs a
locomotive. In ordinary parlance both are called engineers. Yet there is a difference between
them--a difference as between day and night. For one merely operates the results of the creative
genius of the other. This almost universal ignorance as to what constitutes an engineer serves
to show to what broad extent the profession of engineering is isolated.

Yet it is a wonderful profession. I say this with due regard for all other professions. For
one cannot but ponder the fact that, if engineers started the greatest war the world has ever
known--and engineers as a body freely admit that if they did not start it they at least made
it possible--they also stopped it, thereby proving themselves possessed of a power greater
than that of any other class of professional men--diplomats and lawyers and divinities not
excepted.

That engineering is a force fraught with stupendous possibilities, therefore, nobody can very
well deny. That it is a force generally exercised for good--despite the World War--I myself,
as an engineer, can truly testify. With some fifteen years spent on the creative end of the
work--the drafting and designing end--I have yet to see, with but two or three rare exceptions,
the genius of engineers turned into any but noble channels.

Thus, engineering is not only a wonderful profession, with the activities of its followers
of utmost importance, but also it is a profession the individual work of whose pioneers, from
Watt to Westinghouse and from Eiffel to Edison, has been epoch-making.

For when James Watt, clock-repairer, tinker, being called into a certain small laboratory in
England more than a century ago to make a few minor repairs on a new design of steam-engine,
discovered, while at work on this crude unit deriving its motion from expanded steam and the
alternate workings of a lever actuated by a weight, the value of superheated steam for power
purposes, and later embodied the idea in a steam-engine of his own, Watt set the civilized
world forward into an era so full of promise and discovery that even we who are living to-day,
despite the wonderful progress already made in mechanics as represented among other things
in the high-speed engine, the dynamo, the airplane, are witnessing but the barest of beginnings.

So with other pioneers--with Eiffel, in the field of tower construction; with Edison, in the
field of electricity; with the Wright brothers, in the field of aerial navigation; With Simon
Lake, inventor of the submarine boat. All were pioneers; all set the civilized world forward;
all--though this perhaps is irrelevant, yet it will serve to reveal the type of men these pioneers
were and are--all overcame great obstacles--Lake not the least among them.

Told that he was visionary, when Lake explained, as he did in his effort to enlist capital
with which to build his first submarine boat, that he could safely submerge his invention and
steer it about on the bed of the ocean as readily as a man can steer an automobile about the
streets of a city, that while submerged he could step out of the boat through a trap-door without
flooding the boat, by the simple process of maintaining a greater air pressure inside than
the pressure of the water outside--Simon Lake, discouraged on every hand, finally decided to
build a boat himself, and did build one, with his own hands--a boat fourteen feet long and
constructed of rough pine timbers painted with coal-tar--in Atlantic Highlands, New Jersey.
With this boat Lake demonstrated to a skeptical world for all time that he was neither a visionary
nor a dreamer, but a practical doer among men--an engineer.

Of such stuff, then, were, and are, engineers made. Whether they realized it or not, whether
the world at large realized it or not, each represented a noble calling, each was a professional
man, each was chiseling his name for all time into the granite foundations of a wonderful profession
even yet only in the building--engineering. Their name is legion, too, and their names will
last because of the fact that their work, remaining as it does after them equally with the
work of followers of the finest of the fine arts, is known to mankind as a benefit to mankind.
Known by their works, the list extends back to the very dawn of history.

For it was men of this calling, the calling of engineers, who in the early days wrought for
purposes of warfare--warfare then being the major industry--the javelin, the spear, the helmet,
the coat of mail, the plate of armor, the slingshot; just as their later brothers, for a like
purpose, conceived and devised the throwing of mustard gas, the two-ton explosive, the aerial
bomb, the mortar shell, the hand-grenade--for the protection, false and true, of the home.
For the upbuilding of the home, for the continuance of the home, men of this calling also it
was who conceived and shaped, among other things, the cook-stove, the chimney, the wheel, the
steam-engine, the spinning-jenny, the suspension-bridge, the bedspring-oh, boy!--the bicycle,
the sandblast, the automobile, the airplane, the wireless.

Thus it will be seen that engineering is a distinctive and important profession. To some even
it is the topmost of all professions. However true that may or may not be to-day, certain it
is that some day it will be true, for the reason that engineers serve humanity at every practical
turn. Engineers make life easier to live--easier in the living; their work is strictly constructive,
sharply exact; the results positive. Not a profession outside of the engineering profession
but that has its moments of wabbling and indecision--of faltering on the part of practitioners
between the true and the untrue. Engineering knows no such weakness. Two and two make four.
Engineers know that. Knowing it, and knowing also the unnumbered possible manifoldings of this
fundamental truism, engineers can, and do, approach a problem with a certainty of conviction
and a confidence in the powers of their working-tools nowhere permitted men outside the profession.

ENGINEERING OPPORTUNITIES

The writer can best illustrate the opportunities for young men which exist in engineering by
a little story. The story is true in every particular. Nor is the case itself exceptional.
Men occupying high places everywhere in engineering, did they but tell their story, would repeat
in substance what is set forth below. More than any other profession to-day, engineering holds
out opportunities for young men possessing the requisite "will to success" and the physical
stamina necessary to carry them forward to the goal. Opportunities in any walk of life are
not all dead--not all in the past. A young man to-day can go as far as he wills. He can go
farther on less capital invested in engineering than in any other profession--that's all.

The young man's name was Smith. He was one of seven children--not the seventh son, either--in
a poor family. At the age of sixteen he went to work in overalls on a section of railroad as
a helper--outdoor, rough work. At seventeen he was transferred to the roundhouse; at nineteen
he apprenticed himself to the machinist trade. Engineering? He did not know what it was, really.
Merely he saw his way clear to earning a livelihood and went after it. He was miserably educated.
His knowledge of mathematics embraced arithmetic up to fractions, at which point it faded off
into blissful "nothingness"--as our New-Thoughtists say. But he had an inquiring mind and a
proper will to succeed. While serving his three years in the shop he bought a course in a correspondence
school and studied nights, taking up, among other things, the subject of mechanical drafting.
When twenty-two years of age he applied for, and got, a position as draftsman in a small company
developing a motorcycle. He was well on his way upward.

He spent a year with this company. He learned much of value to him not only about mathematics,
but about engineering as a whole as well. One day he decided that the field was restricted--at
least, too much so for him--and he left and went with a Westinghouse organization in Pittsburgh.
His salary was in the neighborhood of a hundred and ten dollars a month. He remained with the
company two years as a designer, and then, having saved up sufficient funds to meet his needs,
went to college, taking special work--physics and chemistry and mathematics. He remained in
school two years. When he came out, instead of returning to the drafting-room and the theoretical
end of the work, he donned overalls once more and went to work in the shop as an erecting man.
Two years afterward he was chief operating engineer in a small cement-plant in the Southwest,
his salary being three thousand dollars a year. A year of this and he returned East, at a salary
of four thousand dollars a year, as operating engineer of a larger plant. Then came a better
offer, with one of the largest, if not the very largest, steel-plants in the country, as superintendent
of power, at a salary of five thousand dollars a year. When the war broke out, or rather when
this country became involved in the war, my friend Smith, at a salary of ten thousand dollars
a year, became associated with a staff of engineers brought together into a corporation manufacturing
shells. And all before he was barely in his thirties!

A young man still, what lies ahead of him can readily be surmised. Smith will follow engineering
on salary until he is probably forty, when he will enter upon a consulting practice, and at
fifty retire with sufficient money to keep him in comfort the remainder of his days. Nor will
he be an exception, as I have stated in the opening paragraph. The profession is crowded with
men who have worked up from equally humble beginnings. Indeed, one of the foremost efficiency
engineers in the country to-day began as an apprentice in a foundry, while another, fully as
well known in efficiency work, began life in the United States navy as a machinist's mate.
Automobile engineers, whose names, many of them, are household words, in particular have gone
big in the profession and from very obscure beginnings. It is not stretching the obvious to
say that the majority of these men, had they entered upon any other work, would never have
been heard from nor have attained to their present wealth and affluence. Smith was just one
of many in a profession offering liberal opportunities. The opportunities still exist and in
just as large a proportion as they ever existed. It remains but for the young man to decide.
The profession itself, almost, will take care of him afterward.

However, not all of our engineers have gone upward by the overalls route. Nor is it at all
necessary to do this in order to attain to success. The high-school graduate, entering a college
of engineering, has an equal chance. Some maintain that he has a better chance. Certain it
is that he is better qualified to cope with the heavier theoretical problems which come up
every day in the average engineer's work. There is a place for him, side by side with the practical
man, and his knowledge will be everywhere respected and sought. But a combination of the theoretical
and the practical, as has frequently been declared, makes for the complete engineer. Some get
the practical side first and the theoretical side later; some get the theoretical side first
and the practical side later. It matters little--save only that he who gets the practical side
first is earning his way while getting it, while the man who goes to college is in the majority
of cases being supported from outside sources while getting what he wants. But in the end it
balances. Merely, the "full" engineer must have both. Having both, he has, literally, the world
within his grasp. For engineering is--to repeat--the adapting of discoveries in science and
art to the uses of mankind. And both art and science reflect and are drawn from Mother Nature.

There is still a great scarcity of engineers. All branches feel the need--civil, mechanical,
mining, chemical, automotive, electrical--the call goes out. It is a call just now, owing to
the vast reconstruction period confronting the world, lifted in strident voice. Engineers everywhere
are needed, which in part accounts for the liberal salaries offered for experienced men. The
demand greatly exceeds the supply, and gives promise of exceeding it for a number of years
to come. All manufacturing-plants, all mining enterprises, of which of both there are thousands
upon thousands, utilize each from one to many hundreds of engineers. Some plants make use of
three or four different kinds--mechanical, civil, electrical, industrial--some only one. But
not a plant of any size but that has need for at least one engineer, and engineers are scarce.
Therefore opportunities are ample.

To the young man seeking a profession, provided he be of a certain type--possessed of certain
inherent qualities, the nature of which I shall set forth in the following chapter--engineering
offers satisfactory money returns and--more satisfactory still--a satisfactory life. The work
is creative from beginning to end; it has to do frequently with movement--always a source of
delight to mankind; a source having its beginnings in earliest infancy, and it is essentially
a work of service. To build a bridge, to design an automatic machine, to locate and bring to
the surface earth's wealth in minerals--surely this is service of a most gratifying kind.

And it pays. The arts rarely pay; science always pays. And engineering being a science, a science
in the pursuit of which also man is offered opportunities for the exercise of his creative
instincts, like art, is therefore doubly gratifying as a life's work. I know--and it will bear
repeating--no other profession that holds so much of bigness and of fullness of life generally.
Engineers themselves reflect it. Usually robust, always active, generally optimistic, engineers
as a group swing through life--and have swung through life from the beginnings of the profession--without
thought of publicity, for instance, or need or desire for it. Their work alone engrossed their
minds. It was enough--it is enough--and more. And that which is sufficient unto a man is Nirvana
unto him--if he but knew it. Engineers seem to know it.

 Out of these minor
branches come yet other branches, more particularly groups, with each in the nature of a specialty,
such as gas engineering, aircraft engineering, steam engineering, telephone engineering, and so on.

Students about to enter engineering colleges usually select one or another of the major branches
and then after graduating begin to specialize. But infrequently Fate has much to do with this
specialization, since after leaving college the average young engineer will turn to the nearest
or most promising vacancy offered him in his chosen field--a major branch--and in the work
eventually become expert and a specialist. If it be a concern manufacturing steam-turbines,
say, the young engineer in time becomes expert and a specialist in steam-turbines. So, too,
with graduates in mining engineering, in electrical engineering, in civil engineering, although
the opportunities for specialization in any of these latter branches are not so good as in
the mechanical field. However, entering upon a certain kind of work, the student usually follows
this work to the end of his days, which is probably what engineering schools expect. All strive
to educate only in the principles of each of the major branches. The rest is up to the graduate,
who is permitted, and generally does, the shaping of his own career afterward.

It is a feature of our democratic form of government--thanks be! Germany does--or did--the
other thing. Germany made careers for her young men, instead of young men for careers, with
the result that she also made machines out of them. America is a nation of individualists,
which is what makes America what it is, and our schools and school systems are responsible.

V

MAKING A CHOICE

About to make a choice among the branches of engineering, the prospective student, unless he
have a decided preference to start with, finds himself confronted with many difficulties. Engineering
is engineering, whether it be mining or electrical or civil or mechanical, and this fact alone
is not without its confusions. Yet if the young man decides for a mining career, say, the choice
may take him, after graduating, off to South Africa, whereas if his choice lay in the electrical
field he may never get any farther from home than the nearest electrical manufacturing plant
in his town or state--and remain there for the duration of his life. This making of a choice
is a momentous thing in a prospective engineer's life. It should be approached with all caution,
and with due regard for the nature of the life he would lead after graduating from school.
If he have a penchant for outdoor life, then the choice, in a way, is easy. He should select
mining or civil engineering as his particular vocation. If he be of those who prefer to remain
more or less indoors in the practice of his profession, mechanical or electrical engineering
should be his choice.

These are the major advantages or disadvantages, depending upon the point of view. The minor
ones are not so easily stated. Speaking always for the young man without a decided preference,
it is the writer's opinion that the prospective student should analyze his particular feelings
in the matter and decide accordingly. Large projects may interest him more than smaller ones.
In this regard, he will find greater satisfaction in following the profession dealing with
large projects, which is, of course, the civil engineering profession--although mining, too,
has its large ventures, which, however, do not "break" as frequently as they do in civil engineering.
On the other hand, the young man may find himself attracted to the development of small propositions,
such as adding-machines and typewriters and sewing-machines, and the like. Finding himself
attracted to these no less important phases of engineering than the development of mines or
the opening up of new country, the young man can, of course, make no better choice than to
enter the mechanical or the electrical field.

It all depends upon the point of view. Nor is there any hard-and-fast rule tying a man down
to a single branch once he finds that he does not like it, or finds that he likes one of the
other branches better, after he has given his chosen branch a trial in the years immediately
following graduation. Not a few mining graduates drift over into straight civil work after
leaving school, and, likewise, not a few in the electrical branches find themselves in time
pursuing mechanical work. Fate here, as in the matter of specialization, works her hand. A
prominent publisher of technical magazines in New York took the degree of Arts in Cornell in
his younger days; and more writers of fiction than you can shake a stick at once labored over
civil-engineering plans as their chosen career. Herbert Hoover is a mining man who best revealed
his capabilities in the field of traffic management--if the work which he supervised in Belgium
may be so termed. Certainly it had to do with getting materials from where they were plentiful
to where they were scarce, which is roughly the work of the traffic manager.

And so it goes. The young man in this particular must decide for himself. Actually, there is
more of mystery and fascination in the electrical field than in any of the other three branches,
and to prospective students this may be not without its especial appeal. To others, the work
of mining may possess its strong attraction, since this work takes its followers into strange
places and among strange people frequently, where oftentimes the mining engineer must live
cheek by elbow with the roughest of adventurers. To yet a third group, civil engineering, with
its work of blazing new trails through an unknown country, and wild outdoor existence through
forests and over mountains and across valleys--may have its strong attraction. While to a fourth
group of prospective students the quiet career, as represented in that of mechanical engineering,
always a more or less thoughtful, studious life, may hold out its inviting side. The mechanical
engineer, like the electrical engineer, is a man who generally commutes, a man who comes and
goes daily between office and home, doing his work at regular hours within the four walls of
his office--a quiet, professional man. Such a life would appeal to the man of family rather
more strongly than either of the outdoor professional branches. Yet the prospective student
must make his own choice.

To the young man who has no particular preference, and who would put it up to the writer as
to just which branch to follow--the young man more or less in need--the writer unhesitatingly
would advise mechanical engineering. It is the one branch offering the largest and quickest
returns, and as a branch it fairly dominates all the other branches, for the reason that whereas
the mechanical engineer can get along without the mining engineer or the civil engineer or
the electrical engineer, neither the mining engineer nor the civil engineer nor the electrical
engineer can always do without the services of the mechanical engineer. No other branch so
overlaps the other branches as does mechanical engineering. The work of the mechanical engineer
is seen in almost every piece of construction reared by the civil man, just as it is seen in
every bit of construction work of the mining and the electrical engineers. At first glance
this may not appear to be true, but a close analysis of different jobs will bring out the truth
of this statement.

Thus mechanical engineering offers largest and quickest returns. It does this for another reason.
Because of this very overlapping upon the other three branches, for every position open in
the electrical field, or the mining or the civil field, there are a dozen vacancies in the
mechanical field. It cannot but be otherwise. Not one of the other branches but what has need
at times for--as I have stated--a mechanical engineer. The casings and base-plates and supports
of motors, for instance, while the motor itself--its windings and the like--is the work of
the electrical engineer, are due to the designing genius of some mechanical man. Likewise,
in the mining field, where shaking screens, to name only one of the many mechanical units necessary
in mining operations, are an essential factor--units operated with pulleys and belts and cams
and levers--all the province of the mechanical engineer--the mechanical man finds his uses.
So in civil work, especially in dam construction where gates are necessary; and in chemical
engineering--to drop into a minor branch--where tanks and vats and ovens and stirring paddles
and the like are used. No matter in which branch a man may go, always he will find evidence
of the presence some time of the mechanical engineer. The mechanical engineer dominates all
the other branches, as has been said before. He is given second place in the order of the branches
merely because the civil engineer happened to be the first and oldest kind of engineer to be
given recognition as a profession. This man made himself a professional man, just as did the
early practitioners of medicine--concocters of herbs in the beginning.

The proper selection will depend upon the young man's predilections and tastes. If he selects
wisely, following out his predilections and tastes with a degree of accuracy, he cannot go
wrong. He cannot go far wrong even if he doesn't follow out his hunches, for the reason that
he can always swing over into any one of the other branches whenever he sees fit to do so.
The thing is done every day, and will continue to be done throughout all time. Merely, it would
be well for the young man, of course, to select in the beginning that branch which most appeals
to him, and to stick to it like glue. Success is certain to be his. For in no other walk of
life are the rewards so sure and so ample and so immediately responsive as in the engineering
professions. These--like the matter of his selection from among the four major branches--are
solely a matter up to the individual.

VI

QUALIFYING FOR PROMOTION

Immediately upon graduating--indeed, often several months before graduating--the engineering
student finds his first job awaiting him. Frequently he finds a number of first jobs awaiting
him and must make a selection. For it is the custom with large manufacturing concerns to send
out scouts in the early spring of each year to address the engineering student bodies, with
the idea in mind of securing the services of as many graduates as the scouts can win over for
their respective organizations through direct appeal. What is usually offered the coming graduate
is a brief apprenticeship in the shop, at a living wage, with promise of as early and rapid
promotion in the organization as the work of the apprentice himself will permit, or improves.

These offers are generally splendid opportunities. The graduate may learn much of a practical
commercial nature which perforce has been denied him in his student days, and also, having
entered upon this apprenticeship, he not only gets acquainted with production on a large scale,
but he is brought into touch with what constitutes most recent acceptable practice as well.
This, provided he be a mechanical or an electrical engineer. Graduates in civil and mining
engineering, while offered positions from executives in these particular branches also, have
no such large opportunities offered them. The work itself does not permit it. Yet in any of
the branches there is never a scarcity of jobs open to graduates upon their leaving college.

To qualify for promotion in any work, but more especially in the professions, one must know
one's business. That is a trite statement, but it will bear repeating. The young graduate at
first will not know his business. His mind will be a chaos of theories based upon myriads of
formulæ which cannot but confuse him in the early days, when he is most earnestly trying to
apply one or more of them to the more or less petty tasks which will be assigned to him. All
he can do under the circumstances--all anybody could do under the circumstances--is to wait
patiently, the while doing the best he can. Problems have a way of working themselves out--the
correct formula will present itself; its true application will become manifest--and thus the
young engineer has learned something of a practical nature which need not forsake him throughout
the remainder of his engineering career.

Engineers are especially tolerant of one another's mistakes and errors. They are much more
so than medical men, for instance. In the field of medicine one must show by many practical
cases wherein a certain treatment has proved effective before the fraternity at large will
even give the practitioner a hearing. This is not so among engineers. Engineers turn to one
another in difficulties with earnest desire to help if they can help; and when one of their
number is in trouble in his efforts to solve a difficult problem the whole body will turn to
him with friendly encouragement and advice, if the latter is wanted. The young graduate who
is struggling with a problem come up in his daily work, if he will but make the fact known
to the engineers on the job in association with him, will find himself surrounded by engineers
every one of whom will be seriously concerned for him and anxious to render assistance.

So the young graduate need entertain no fears on the ground of possible errors when starting
out. Merely he must go slow; take his own good time on a job; ask all the questions possible
of his engineer neighbors. Frankness in engineering, as in any other walk of life, pays. The
bluffer is not wanted. No man knows it all, and certainly no engineer knows all there is to
know about his profession. Time was when this might have been true; but it isn't true to-day.
The work of engineering research and development has become so complex that engineers are forced
to specialize. The engineering graduate, entering upon his first job, will discover early that
he, too, must specialize. This will not be difficult, owing to the fact that his engineering
education has been general and designed to embrace in a liberal way all practice. Drawing,
as he will, from this liberal source that which he finds necessary in the solving of his initial
problems, he will find himself within a short time becoming, willy-nilly, a specialist.

In the earlier years there should be considerable study done after hours on the part of the
graduate engineer. Because his education has been general in the field, and he now holds a
position with a company manufacturing steam-turbines, say, he must "wise up," as the saying
goes, on the subject of steam-turbines. It will do him no harm to trace back to its source
all progress made in the field of turbine engineering and construction. He will find no scarcity
of books on the subject, and with every hour spent with these volumes he will become more valuable
to the organization employing him. Likewise, if he find himself working for an electrical manufacturing
concern, and himself a graduate in electrical engineering, if the product be only a single
line, and so small a thing as spark-plugs, it will profit him greatly to read whatever has
been printed on the subject of spark-plugs. So with the mining graduate in the matter of the
different processes of recovering minerals; so with the civil graduate, especially in the concrete
field of construction, which has made rapid strides in the past few years--the graduate should
absorb as much as he can of the available works printed on the subject. Indeed, this is the
profession of it, in that the practitioner must ever be alive and alert to what is being done
and has been done from the beginning in his chosen line of endeavor.

Next must come fealty. The graduate on his first job must believe--and if he does not believe
ought to change connections--that the product of his company is the best in the market. This
need not necessarily be true; but he must feel that it is true. For only in this way can he
put the best that is in him into his work. Industry--and the engineer is the backbone of industry--is
a hotbed of competition. Any organization needs all the enthusiasm it can get. Greatest enthusiasm
of all must come from within its own circles. Lacking this enthusiasm within its own family,
the organization as a whole suffers. The graduate must first of all supply enthusiasm to the
source of his employment, because at first he can supply but very little else. He must be true
to his trust in ways other than the mere doing of what he is told or producing what he is expected
to produce. This attitude cannot but help him qualify for promotion, and rapidly. It is a very
important factor in any engineer's advancement.

Then there is the matter of patience. The writer knows of no other qualification more fruitful
of reward than patience. The word control is frequently used in this regard--self-control.
Its other name, however, is patience--the thing that gives a man to try and try again until
he succeeds. Engineering is a difficult profession, though not more difficult than other professions,
and in the average engineer's working-day many things occur which, if he be not possessed of
infinite patience, will serve to try him to a considerable degree. Patience with those below
him--patience with those above him--patience with himself--these are all necessary and will
prove helpful to him in reaching the top. He must accept the petty tasks with a cheerfulness
no less apparent than he accepts the more important ones. He must present his own ideas to
his superiors with a degree of caution which, where the ideas are rejected, will yet permit
him to withdraw within himself without giving the impression of being peeved. For engineering
is above all other things the interchange of ideas among men having an equal training but a
vastly different quality of experience. Men of diverse experience thus drawn together make
for a balanced engineering staff, and a balanced engineering staff makes for a well-organized
whole. I denote, after undulation to satisfaction, that my experience, i was the parent, plenty,

.
 The list is not long, but
the insight of those who form this short list cannot but be recognized. What these men have
said and done concerning matters freely apart from the subject of engineering reveals them
as members of a fraternity well qualified to lead public opinion rather than to follow it,
as has been the province of engineers in the past. Each when he has spoken or entered upon
action having the public welfare in mind has pronounced or demonstrated a truth which fairly
crackled with sanity.

Engineers belong in civic affairs. The world of humanity needs men of their stamp in high places.
Humanity needs men in control of state and national affairs who would hold the interests of
humanity sacred. Engineers are such men. Not that engineers more than any other professional
men are sprouting wings--not that. But engineers do see things in their true light--cannot
see them in any other light than the one imposed by the law of mathematics, which is that two
and two make four, never five or three--and this involuntarily would admit of decisions and
grant graces from the point of view of absolute truth, which is, of course, the point of view
of humanity--the greatest good for the greatest number. With such men occupying high places
in the nation's affairs, the world of men and mankind would leap forward ethically and spiritually
at a pace in keeping with the pace at which civilization has progressed under the impetus of
engineering thought since the days of Watt. Nobody can deny that progress. Nobody could well
deny the fact that ethical progress under engineering guidance would be equally great.

I hold a brief for engineers, of course. Engineering has been my major work for twenty years
and more. It has been my privilege to associate intimately with two men--yea, three--possessed
of great engineering ability. The third man failed of great repute, owing chiefly to his advanced--rather
too much advanced--visionings. He wanted to talk across the ocean by telephone at a time when
the cable interests successfully prevented him from commercializing his apparatus. And he died
a disappointed inventor. But he had the stuff in him, the thing that makes for human greatness,
just as had the other and more successful two men with whom I as a designer was privileged
to work. All were men of kindly spirit, of broad outlook, of unselfish devotion to worldly
interests. Each was a humanitarian. Each saw things as they are, and each saw things as they
should be, and each thought much on problems of human welfare and betterment. Of such men in
civic affairs the nation, and indeed the entire world of nations, has had but a sad too few
in the past. It is to be hoped, and it is the belief of the writer, that engineers will become
more plentiful in civic life in the future.

I have always believed that the man who reached an advanced age without a sizable bank-account
is a fact which would well serve as a definition as to what constitutes an idealist. There
are many such men--meaning, of course, men having a level set of brains, and not mental incompetents.
Such men are inclined to things other than the accumulation of bank-accounts. They strive toward
goals which to them are more worth while--self-improvement, for instance, spiritual growth
being a better term. Of such men were the world's acknowledged saviors. A man who can wilfully
thrust oars against the current of a stream flowing currency-wise, in such a way as to force
himself into a back eddy or pool more or less stagnant, is a man pronouncedly great among men.
The world is loath to recognize such a man for what he is; yet such men have lived and still
live and will continue to live, always more for others than for themselves--seeing life in
the true, in other and more gracious words.

Engineers, in the abstract, are such men. The accumulation of money is secondary with them.
Their work holds first place in importance. Possessed of that professional pride which will
not permit a man to set aside his work and enter a more lucrative and materially satisfactory
field of endeavor--if he starve in his obstinacy--engineers are men of the temperament, aside
from the training, to minister to public needs and desires. Self-effacement is the engineer's
chief characteristic. He views largely and without bias. He can see things from the other fellow's
angle because he is not an engineer if he has not the gift of imagination. The successful engineer
has this most precious of endowments, and, having it, cannot but be possessed also of kindliness
and sympathy, which are imagination's own brothers. Kindliness and sympathy are needed in the
high places of our government for the people by the people. And because men in time gravitate
to their rightful sphere of usefulness through the workings of an all-wise Providence, engineers
already have turned and are turning toward the administration of public affairs.

IX

CODE OF ETHICS

All engineering societies have a code of ethics for the guidance of their membership bodies.
In each case it is a code based upon other and older codes, codes long in practice among professional
men, such as lawyers and doctors. It is a code built up on Christian principles, as it should
be, and rarely is it ignored among men of the profession. To do unto others as you would have
others do unto you is the basis of its precepts, though more concretely it aims to guide the
engineer in his business intercourse with other men in such a way as to give all an equal chance
without transgressing the law. The so-called building codes in effect in large cities are intended
to hold engineers to restrictions for the greatest good of the greatest number, and the code
of ethics in practice among each of the engineering professions likewise was devised toward
this end. There seems to be need for it.

Perhaps by pointing out where engineers sometimes transgress, the writer more effectively can
indicate the need of a code and the principles of which the engineering code of ethics consists.
Even to-day there are engineers digressing from the path indicated by the professional body,
though in such a way as to benefit still by the protection of the law, and to be not openly
susceptible to admonition from the engineering societies' committees. Engineers of this stamp
at best are but tricksters. Actually, they should be debarred from practice, just as the legal
fraternity takes effective action against members of the bar who go outside the pale, though
nothing is ever done to engineers. Engineering organizations in this regard are weak. The man's
name should at least be posted, or, better still, published in the society's bulletin, so that
the fraternity at large could know, and, knowing, could warn men with capital to invest--the
trickster's especial prey--for its own welfare.

There was an engineer brought to the attention of the writer whose activities were devoted
to securing for his clients men of no mechanical knowledge who yet wanted something done by
machinery. A manufacturer of paper dolls, say, having entered upon this phase of manufacturing
only because he had money to invest and not because he was interested in mechanics, would see
the need in his plant for additional mechanical devices to cut down manufacturing costs. The
engineer to whom I have reference would find this type of manufacturer his particular "meat,"
because of the man's ignorance of mechanics, and, after clinching him with a contract drawn
up by the engineer's lawyer, would undertake to devise for this manufacturer a perpetual-motion
machine, if that happened to be what the manufacturer wanted. The engineer conducted a machine-shop
in connection with his "consulting" office, where, at a dollar an hour for the use of his machine-tools,
he would "develop" his ideas, as passed upon by the manufacturer who knew no more of construction
or the reading of mechanical drawings than he did of the chicanery of the engineer, and in
this way roll up the costs against the unfortunate. In the end the engineer might and might
not produce a satisfactory working machine. There was nothing in the contract about this--save
only as it protected the engineer. What was indeed produced was a list of costs for the development
often of several designs of a given idea that to say the least were heartrending.

Then there is the engineer who for a consideration will bear false testimony against his neighbor,
or his neighbor's ox. This happens most frequently in municipal traction or lighting wars,
set before tribunals under the caption of "The People vs. the S. S. Street Railway Company,"
or in a battle of alleged infringement of patent rights. There are engineering experts, just
as there are legal experts, who deem it within their code of ethics to address themselves and
their energies toward the refutation of such claims, however wrong or right these claims may
be. Engineering is an exact science. It is based on principles hardly refutable. Yet there
are engineers who will and can confound these principles before a court of law in such manner
as to win for their clients a decision of non-suit where the facts point glaringly to infringement--in
the matter of mechanics--or to win for their clients a favorable decision in the matter of
costs of maintenance and operation of a railway, in a case of this kind. As has been said,
figures don't lie, but figurers sometimes do.

Other instances of breach of engineering ethics, however otherwise secure from the clutches
of the law, occur to the writer, but the two just cited ought to serve. At best, the topic
is unpleasant and by no means indicates the character of the profession as a whole. Where there
is one engineer who will perjure himself in the fashion as set forth above there are many thousands
of engineers who could not be bought for this purpose at any amount of money. The profession
of engineering is notably clean; its code of ethics rigidly adhered to; the rights of others,
both in and out of the profession, regarded with something akin to sacredness. Engineers, as
a body, for instance, possess a peculiarly rigid idea concerning themselves in relation to
branches of the profession outside their own and yet intimately close to their own. Called
in as an expert in the matter of heating and lighting a building, say, the heating and lighting
engineer will rigidly confine himself to this phase of the engineering venture and to no other,
however he may find his work again and again overlapping the work of the structural engineer
or the industrial engineer--phases concerning which he may possess important knowledge. He
regards these things as strictly none of his business, and in doing so conserves the esteem
and friendship of his confrères.

The code of ethics is a liberal one among the engineering groups. It has been laid down with
an eye to fairness both for the practitioner and the client. Rigidly held to, it will admit
of no engineer going far wrong in the practice of his profession, and, broken, will not land
him in jail. It is presupposed that engineers are men of intelligence. A man of intelligence
will hold himself to the spirit of the Ten Commandments if he would attain to success, and
to the letter of them if he would be happy during the declining days of his life. Most engineers
realize this and accept it as their every-day working creed. Life to them, like the medium
through which they give expression to their ideas, is a matter of mathematics. Two steps taken
in a wrong direction mean an equal number of steps forcibly retraced--or the whole problem
goes wrong. Engineers rarely take the two steps in the wrong direction. When they do take wrong
steps they are quick to right them. For the code is always before their eyes.

X

FUTURE OF THE ENGINEER

Just at present the future of the engineer is more richly promising than it might otherwise
have been but for the war. Due to the period of reconstruction now confronting the world, a
work almost wholly that of the engineering professions, engineers for a period of a decade
at least are destined to be overburdened with projects. Nor will any one branch be occupied
to the exclusion of any other branch or branches. Civil and structural engineers will, as a
matter of course, have the first call; but with the work of these men well under way--consisting
of the reconstruction of towns and cities--mechanical and electrical men will necessarily be
called upon, with, no doubt, liberal demand for mining engineers. Each branch will have its
place and serve its usefulness in the order as the reconstruction work itself will fall, with
the result that all branches of the profession will be busily occupied.

Manufacturers have been ready or are getting ready for this unprecedented promised activity
for some little time. Representatives are flocking abroad on every boat sailing from these
shores with schemes and plans for the rapid upbuilding of devastated Europe. These men, for
the most part, are engineers embracing all branches of the profession, and each is a man especially
well qualified to serve in his branch. In a way he is a specialist. He may represent a giant
structural organization, or a machine-tool manufacturer, or an electric-lighting and power
concern--any one of the many fields of industrial enterprises whose product is needed to place
demoralized France and Belgium back upon a productive basis. For when the construction period
is over with there will be need for machine-tools and equipment for operating these tools,
such as engines and boilers and motors, all of which come properly under the head of engineering
productive enterprises.

Engineers--especially American engineers--will be in great demand, as they are already. Nor
will the close of the reconstruction period witness an abatement of this demand. Having once
entered the foreign field on a large scale, they will of necessity continue to be in demand
not only for the furtherance of industrial projects, but for purposes of maintaining that which
has been installed at their hands. Machinery has a way of needing periodical overhauling--even
the best of machinery--and this will entail the services of many engineers for long after the
machinery itself has been set up. The services of erecting engines, operating engineers, supervising
engineers--known more properly as industrial engineers--following, as the need will, close
upon the heels of the constructing and selling men--will keep the many branches alive and in
foreign trade for much more than a decade--or so it seems to the writer. Other nations may,
of course, whip into the field and in time crowd out the more distant--meaning American--engineers
and engineering products. But I don't think so, because of the acknowledged supremacy of American
engineers in many directions. The war itself taught the world that we possessed such a supremacy,
and the world will be slow to forget--especially the purchasing side of nations themselves
so crippled of man-power as to be for a generation well-nigh helpless.

So the immediate future of the engineer is richly promising. It is so rich with promise that
a young man could hardly do better than to enter upon engineering as a life-work, provided
he has no particular choice of careers, and would enter upon an attractive and scopeful one.
His work is already laid out for him. Taking up a course of study leading to the degree of
M.E., or C.E., or E.E., in four years, upon graduating, he can retrace his way, or the way
of his brother, over the battle-fields of Europe, a constructive rather than a destructive
agent now, a torch-bearer, a pilgrim, a son of democracy once again advancing the standard
in the interests of humanity. He may do this as a mechanical engineer, as a civil engineer,
as an electrical engineer, as a mining engineer; it matters not. What does matter is that he
will be carrying Old Glory, in spirit if not in the letter, to the distant outposts--the especial
province of the Anglo-Saxon race, anyway, from the beginnings of this race--and so serving
to maintain the respect and affection already established in these countries by our soldiery.
To the writer the thing looks mighty attractive.

Yet the young engineer's future need not lie in distant places necessarily. He may stay at
home and still have his work cut out for him. The promised unparalleled activity in the field
of engineering on the other side cannot but enlarge and accentuate the activity on this side
of the water. Plants will be operating full blast to catch up with the demand imposed by this
abnormal activity, and thus the engineer will perforce bear the burdens of production. He will
bear them in all directions, since industrial activity means engineering activity, and the
work of production cannot go on without him. In the mines, the mills, the quarries, the foundry,
the machine-shop, the pattern-shop, the drafting-room, the engineering offices, the consulting
divisions--all these, necessitating as they do the employment of one or more engineers in at
least a supervising capacity, will have urgent need for his services. Constructive work always,
he will grow as his work grows, and because the growth of his work under these abnormal conditions
will be of itself abnormal, his own growth under these conditions will be abnormal. He will
find himself a full engineer before his rightful time.

Right here it would be well to point out to the young graduate the importance of getting under
a capable engineer. For, much as the writer dislikes to admit it, there are engineers who are
not capable and who yet occupy positions of great responsibility. The young engineer, fresh
from college and a bit puzzled as to the game as a whole, if he accept a connection under an
engineer, for instance, whose inventive ideas are impractical, will unwittingly absorb such
a man's viewpoint on construction, and so spoil himself as an engineer for all time to come.
Cases like this are not rare. The writer personally knows of more than one young man who enlisted
under an engineer whose ideas on administration probably accounted, being as they were good
ideas, for his position of authority over matters not strictly of an administrative nature.
The man wanted to exercise his authority over all things within his department--not the least
of which was machine design--with the result that the young graduate's normally practical viewpoint
on matters of construction became warped into that of the man over him, and continued warped
for so long as he remained under this man, and frequently longer, indeed, to the end of his
engineering career. The young engineer must pick his boss as our young men are facetiously
advised to pick their parents. The wrong selection will prove disastrous to him in after-life.

Which is but an aside--though a very important one. To emulate a weakling in whatever walk
of life, be it painting or writing or engineering, means to begin wrong. Everybody knows the
importance of a right beginning. It is no less true of the young engineer than of others.

And what with the example set by Herbert Hoover and other dollar-a-year men, mostly engineers,
in the nation's administrative affairs during the war, the future of the engineer looks bright
in these quarters as well as in quarters embracing engineering constructive work wholly. The
engineer of the future undoubtedly will take active part in municipal and national affairs,
more likely than not in time entering upon a political career as a side interest, as the lawyer
enters upon it to-day, within time--so it seems to the writer--members of the engineering professions
occupying positions of great trust, such as state governorships and--who knows?--the Presidency
itself. Certainly the hand points this way. More and more engineers are coming into prominence
in the public eye, and with every member of the profession so coming, the respect for men of
his profession multiplies among laymen. It is not too much to say, therefore, that engineers
are destined to fill places of great political power. It is to be hoped that they are. Whether
they do or not, the future at this writing amply promises it, and so forcibly that it may well
be included as existing for the engineer, as being a part of the future of the engineer.

WHAT CONSTITUTES ENGINEERING SUCCESS

A graduate of Cornell, in the class of '05, after placing away his diploma where it could not
trouble him through suggestiveness, accepted a position with a large manufacturing concern
in western Pennsylvania. He was twenty-three years old. He went into the shop to get the practical
side of certain theories imposed upon his receptive nature through four long years of study
in a mechanical-engineering course. The concern manufactured among other things steam-turbines,
and this young man, having demonstrated in school his particular aptitude for thermodynamics--the
study of heat and its units in its application to engines, and the like--entered the erecting
department. Donning overalls, and with ordinary rule in his hip pocket--as against the slide-rule
with which he had worked out his theoretical calculations during his college years--he went
to work at whatever was assigned him as a task by his superiors--shop foremen, assistant superintendent,
occasionally an engineer from the office.

This young man did many things. He helped to assemble turbine parts; carried word of petty
alterations to the proper officials: assisted in the work of making tests; made detailed reports
on the machine's performance; screwed up and backed off nuts; in short, got very well acquainted
with the steam-turbine as manufactured by this company. He knew the fundamentals of machine
construction, and an understanding of the details of this particular type of turbine therefore
came easy to him. He worked shop hours, carried his lunch in a box, changed his overalls every
Monday like a veteran. Usually his overalls more than needed changing, because he was not afraid
of the grease and grime with which he came into contact throughout the day. He liked the work
and went to it like a dog to a bone. He was applying in a practical way what he had learned
in college of a theoretical nature, and finding the thing of amazing interest.

He made progress. In time his work was brought to the attention of the chief engineer, and
one day, when the president of the company, who was also an inventor of national repute and
responsible for the design of the turbine being manufactured by the organization, wanted to
make certain bold changes in the design, the chief engineer sent for the young engineer whose
work in college in thermodynamics had won for him certain honors, with the result that our
hero found himself presently seated opposite the president at a table in the latter's office,
engaged in working out calculations on his slide-rule--calculations beyond the powers of the
president, because he was not a heavy theoretician. This call was a big advance indeed, for
it marked him as a man of promise--a "comer"--in the concern. The president liked the ease
with which the young engineer "got" him in the matter of the proposed changes, and quite before
either realized it both were talking freely, exchanging ideas, in the field of turbine construction
generally. The young man unconsciously was driving home the fact that he was a capable engineer,
one who, while still lacking in broad experience, was nevertheless possessed of the proper
attitude toward engineering as a whole to compel the interest and attention of his superior.

The young man eventually was sent out upon the road as an erecting man. Manufacturing that'he arrived
s n'to be, that boards at house, askin'always what was a mention sets something for them that he had
to take somethin'for a s nor he served as infirmities it was far. Aqua fortis, he accepted,-- because
you know that'the feed your region, you get it had generally good, and had so that you was then mind
you take it arrived. He was not a male, he was too by drinkin'jest he was own mind was gone
to--, and that he was plenty our mention. You arrived couldn't scare him complete it was at
names,. Next to a, says he entered, a safest for man, fool.

I was never as he distrust anything for him and schoolmistress heerd accepted they was keepin company
and he was go'it'to young something. But as i might have cognize it was formerly often will

heerd him will be yet say he was not potent, and that she worked
up pattern of his ever, he seemed to organization by; but i ha'n't
complete that success to find, or there is them that my daughter and them
that her.
 His salary had gone
up apace with his progress; he had met the right girl at a club dance in the suburban town
where he had taken modest quarters; he was rapidly headed toward success both as an engineer
and a citizen. He had been out of school probably six years, and was still a very young man,
with all the world practically before him.

One day he was asked by the chief engineer of the concern to journey to New York, and read
a paper before his engineering society at one of the regular annual meetings, on the subject
of thermodynamics in its relation to the company's own product--the turbine. He tipped over
his chair in his eagerness to get out of the office and on the train. He realized the importance
of this opportunity. He was to appear before his fellow-engineers--the best and most capable
and prominent in the profession--and to appear as an authority on his subject! The thing was
another step forward. He prepared a paper, basing it on his six years' experience in steam-turbines,
and when he reached New York had something of value to tell his brother engineers. The meeting
was held in the afternoon, and, dressing for the part, he stepped out upon the platform before
a gathering of some eight or nine hundred engineers and delivered himself of his subject with
credit to himself and to his organization. Not only that. In the rebuttal, when engineers seated
in the auditorium rose to confound him with questions--engineers representing rival turbine
concerns--he proved himself quick at the bat and more than once confounded those who would
confound him.

He was making his mark on the industrial times. His paper was reviewed in the technical journals
and almost overnight our young hero found himself recognized as an authority in his chosen
branch. He was sought out for other articles by technical editors, his associates in the home
plant generously commended him for his work; his salary received another elevation; he called
on the girl that night and had her set the date. Then he plugged for salvation--further knowledge
as a turbine man--harder than ever. Having won the full confidence of the officials of the
company by this time, he was given free voice in all matters having to do with the design of
their product, and shortly after his first little boy was born was promoted to the position
of assistant chief engineer. He served in this capacity for two years, and then, realizing
that he had gone as far up in the organization as it was physically possible to go, owing to
the fact that the chief engineer was the president's sister's husband--or something like that--he
accepted an offer from one of the rival concerns manufacturing turbines and entered the organization
as chief engineer at a salary too big to mention. But, after all, do we, by employing short absentee for we are not only,
so they be foreigners, as to whether they were bred and born even done
beyond, or nothing on orthoepy and this Alps,-- do we, by employing eyed traveler,
secure the Italian?

Will enter that delicate-true critics say the purity, by informing me which of the generous singers
i have known for the third-- age i should choose as Begrez of being super sibilation-- Catalani and recent,
or Garcia a European and prebendary the Fleming? His direction even then
was clearly marked. All he had to do, and all he did do, was to develop himself in this single
direction. He did nothing that would be impossible to any other engineering graduate. Merely
he hewed to the line--persisted in remaining in the one branch of the game--met with his reward
in time just as any young man would meet with it. There was nothing of phenomenal character,
nothing of the genius, revealed in what he did. His way is open to all. And it is a way both
worthy and admirable, for to-day this engineer stands high in his profession and is meeting
with financial reward in keeping with his position among engineers.

There you have in the tracing of one engineer's progress to success precisely what constitutes
engineering success. The details may differ, but the principles and the rewards will be the
same, whether you enter upon civil or mechanical or mining or electrical engineering. Success
in engineering constitutes certain satisfactory money rewards and an even more satisfactory
recognition by one's associates and fellows. Success in anything is that. A man must work for
them, however. There never was and never will be a rainbow path to the heights. Toil and an
abiding faith in one's own capabilities--these make for success. Success makes for happiness,
and happiness, as everybody knows, is all there is to this life.

I wish all men happiness.

THE PERSONAL SIDE

As to the personal side of engineering as a career, if it would be a source of gratification
to you to know that you were helping to build up the civilized world, then you should enter
the engineering profession. "the Politician to Northampton unfold oisters with decease." The significance
of which is, to resource as them collapsed i at length. For burg being eighty knot from water, glance

 Entering a house for the first time, and trained as a mechanical engineer,
he will note the character of the woodwork, the decorations, the atmosphere, the arrangement
of the furnishings, all with the same facility that he will note details upon entering for
the first time a power-station or a manufacturing plant--things within his own province.

Nor is this faculty confined to the concrete. Engineers are of that deeply instinctive race
of folk who perceive cause in effect with the lightning swiftness of a wild animal. If they
are not this when entering upon the profession, assuredly they become so after a period spent
in the work. Something about the practice of engineering breeds it--breeds this objective seeing
and abstract reasoning--and to be possessed of it is to get more out of life than otherwise
is possible. Which possibly accounts for the fact that engineers as a group seem to have a
common-sense viewpoint of things, one that is frankly acknowledged and drawn upon when needed
by men in other walks of life. Engineers are extremely practical-minded, and this makes for
a certain outlook that will not permit of visionary scaring away from the common sense and
the practical on the part of its possessor. Engineers know why things occur without having
witnessed even the occurrence itself. Their powers of reasoning are developed to degrees beyond
the average--or they seem to be--and out of this comes one of the sources of gratification
on the personal side to the man who pursues engineering as a profession.

The thing spreads out as I contemplate it. I would make so bold as to say that the man of engineering
training will see more at a glance when first viewing the Grand Cañon, say, than will any other
professionally trained man. Should the Cañon collapse, he would know instantly why it collapsed.
He could give an opinion on the wonderful color effects that would interest the artist, and
he would know without hesitation how best to descend to the bottom and wherein to seek the
easiest trail. All this, without his being a civil or a mining engineer, understand; merely
a man trained in constructive mechanics. No need be perpetrated to determine any species of this dint
upon a bloom have entirely. By the men more or more of the body will be leading, show point and
tubercle characters, and come these are used in the key. Again, the engineer sees in a tree,
with its tapering trunk, the symbol of all tower construction, just as he sees in the shape
of a man's arm the pattern to follow when devising a cast-iron lever for an automatic machine.
He sees things, does the engineer; sees objectively; follows nature throughout.

All this being true, the engineer has a rather interesting life of it. For not only does he
see a little more clearly than otherwise would be possible to him without his education and
training, but also he does things with his hands that come easy to him without previously having
undertaken them. The engineer can do much around his own home, if he so choose, that of itself
is a source of great satisfaction. Every discovery, invention, surround, life, observation, or happiness
of a happening for quality in the year, there is hither enter, concisely, but intelligibly.--
Taste, in fact, is the essence or pull as he would find of this ideal pursuits were of world for one
period. We would recommend it to be laid in the place where the man may perchance lose five time

 He need not do these things, ever; but
if he wants ever to do them, he finds that he can do them and do a creditable job of each,
and this without his ever having turned his hand to the work before.

Which sums up in a measure the personal side. The engineer is not a superior being. Merely
he is a man possessed of a highly specialized education and training which peculiarly fits
him for any practical work, and out of this work, for practical thinking of the kind known
as constructive. Being constructive with his hands, he cannot but in time become constructive
with his brain. Being constructive as a thinker first, he cannot but become constructive as
a doer later. The one hinges closely on the other, and having both, as the engineer must who
would be a successful engineer, he has as much of the world under his control as comes to any
man, and, in a great degree, more than is the favorable lot of most men. For the engineer is
both a thinker and a doer. Ponder that--you. Men are either one or the other--most men--and
rarely are they both. Engineer. Engelmann calls attention to the fact that this coin approaches Coryphantha
