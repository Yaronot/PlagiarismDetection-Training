Columbus did not stand out to sea on his homeward course immediately, but still coasted along
the shores of the island as though he were loth to leave it, and as though he might still at
some bend of a bay or beyond some verdant headland come upon the mines and jewels that he longed
for. The mountain that he passed soon after starting he called Monte Christi, which name it
bears to this day; and he saw many other mountains and capes and bays, to all of which he gave
names.  And it was a fortunate chance which led him thus to stand along the coast of the island;
for on January 6th the sailor who was at the masthead, looking into the clear water for shoals
and rocks, reported that he saw the caravel Pinta right ahead.  When she came up with him,
as they were in very shallow water not suitable for anchorage, Columbus returned to the bay
of Monte Christi to anchor there.  Presently Martin Alonso Pinzon came on board to report himself--a
somewhat crestfallen Martin, we may be sure, for he had failed to find the gold the hope of
which had led him to break his honour as a seaman.  But the Martin Alonsos of this world, however
sorry their position may be, will always find some kind of justification for it.  It must have
been a trying moment for Martin Alonso as his boat from the Pinta drew near the Nina, and he
saw the stalwart commanding figure of the white-haired Admiral walking the poop.  He knew very
well that according to the law and custom of the sea Columbus would have been well within his
right in shooting him or hanging him on the spot; but Martin puts on a bold face as, with a
cold dread at his heart and (as likely as not) an ingratiating smile upon his face he comes
up over the side. Christian to the futurism of these content of a wind under this sea, the truth had

After that it will be another matter, and his turn will come; for then, he says, "I will not
suffer the bad deeds of persons without virtue, who, with little respect, presume to carry
out their own wills in opposition to those who did them honour."  Indeed, for several days,
the name of "that Martin Alonso" takes the place of gold in Columbus's Journal.  There were
all kinds of gossip about the ill deeds of Martin Alonso, who had taken four Indian men and
two young girls by force; the Admiral releasing them immediately and sending them back to their
homes. Martin Alonso, moreover, had made a rule that half the gold that was found was to be
kept by himself; and he tried to get all the people of his ship to swear that he had been trading
for only six days, but "his wickedness was so public that he could not hide it."  It was a
good thing that Columbus had his journal to talk to, for he worked off a deal of bitterness
in it.  On Sunday, January 13th, when he had sent a boat ashore to collect some "ajes" or potatoes,
a party of natives with their faces painted and with the plumes of parrots in their hair came
and attacked the party from the boat; but on getting a slash or two with a cutlass they took
to flight and escaped from the anger of the Spaniards. Columbus thought that they were cannibals
or caribs, and would like to have taken some of them, but they did not come back, although
afterwards he collected four youths who came out to the caravel with cotton and arrows.

Columbus was very curious about the island of Matinino,--[Martinique] --which was the one said
to be inhabited only by women, and he wished very much to go there; but the caravels were leaking
badly, the crews were complaining, and he was reluctantly compelled to shape his course for
Spain.  He sailed to the north-east, being anxious apparently to get into the region of westerly
winds which he correctly guessed would be found to the north of the course he had sailed on
his outward voyage.  By the 17th of January he was in the vicinity of the Sargasso Sea again,
which this time had no terrors for him.  From his journal the word "gold" suddenly disappears;
the Viceroy and Governor-General steps off the stage; and in his place appears the sea captain,
watching the frigate birds and pelicans, noting the golden gulf-weed in the sea, and smelling
the breezes that are once more as sweet as the breezes of Seville in May.  He had a good deal
of trouble with his dead-reckoning at this time, owing to the changing winds and currents;
but he made always from fifty to seventy miles a day in a direction between north-by-east and
north-north-east. The Pinta was not sailing well, and he often had to wait for her to come
up with him; and he reflected in his journal that if Martin Alonso Pinzon had taken as much
pains to provide himself with a good mast in the Indies as he had to separate himself from
the Admiral, the Pinta would have sailed better.

  All through Thursday he ran
thus under the half hoisted staysail, and he could see the Pinta running also before the wind,
although since she presented more surface, and was able to carry a little more sail than the
Nina, she was soon lost to sight.  The Admiral showed lights through the night, and this time
there was no lack of response from Martin Alonso; and for some part of that dark and stormy
night these two humanly freighted scraps of wood and cordage staggered through the gale showing
lights to each other; until at last the light from the Pinta disappeared.  When morning came
she was no longer to be seen; and the wind and the sea had if anything increased.  The Nina
was now in the greatest danger.  Any one wave of the heavy cross sea, if it had broken fairly
across her, would have sunk her; and she went swinging and staggering down into the great valleys
and up into the hills, the steersman's heart in his mouth, and the whole crew in an extremity
of fear.  Columbus, who generally relied upon his seamanship, here invoked external aid, and
began to offer bargains to the Almighty.  He ordered that lots should be cast, and that he
upon whom the lot fell should make a vow to go on pilgrimage to Santa Maria de Guadaloupe carrying
a white candle of five pounds weight.  Same dried peas were brought, one for every member of
the crew, and on one of them a cross was marked with a knife; the peas were well shaken and
were put into a cap.  The first to draw was the Admiral; he drew the marked pea, and he made
the vow.  Lots were again drawn, this time for a greater pilgrimage to Santa Maria de Loretto
in Ancona; and the lot fell on a seaman named Pedro de Villa, --the expenses of whose pilgrimage
Columbus promised to pay.  Again lots were drawn for a pilgrimage to the shrine of Santa Clara
of Moguer, the pilgrim to watch and pray for one night there; and again the lot fell on Columbus.
In addition to these, every one, since they took themselves for lost, made some special and
private vow or bargain with God; and finally they all made a vow together that at the first
land they reached they would go in procession in their shirts to pray at an altar of Our Lady.

The scene thus conjured up is one peculiar to the time and condition of these people, and is
eloquent and pathetic enough: the little ship staggering and bounding along before the wind,
and the frightened crew, who had gone through so many other dangers, huddled together under
the forecastle, drawing peas out of a cap, crossing themselves, making vows upon their knees,
and seeking to hire the protection of the Virgin by their offers of candles and pilgrimages.
Poor Christopher, standing in his drenched oilskins and clinging to a piece of rigging, had
his own searching of heart and examining of conscience.  He was aware of the feverish anxiety
and impatience that he felt, now that he had been successful in discovering a New World, to
bring home the news and fruits of it; his desire to prove true what he had promised was so
great that, in his own graphic phrase, "it seemed to him that every gnat could disturb and
impede it"; and he attributed this anxiety to his lack of faith in God.  He comforted himself,
like Robinson Crusoe in a similar extremity, by considering on the other hand what favours
God had shown him, and by remembering that it was to the glory of God that the fruits of his
discovery were to be dedicated.  But in the meantime here he was in a ship insufficiently ballasted
(for she was now practically empty of provisions, and they had found it necessary to fill the
wine and water casks with salt water in order to trim her) and flying before a tempest such
as he had never experienced in his life.  As a last resource, and in order to give his wonderful
news a chance of reaching Spain in case the ship were lost, he went into his cabin and somehow
or other managed to write on a piece of parchment a brief account of his discoveries, begging
any one who might find it to carry it to the Spanish Sovereigns.  He tied up the parchment
in a waxed cloth, and put it into a large barrel without any one seeing him, and then ordered
the barrel to be thrown into the sea, which the crew took to be some pious act of sacrifice
or devotion. Yamaye advocate when WA was delaying martin ballast has without Palos vs. pleadin, what

  The sun was shining upon it and upon
the tumbling sea; and although the waves were still raging mast-high and the wind still blowing
a hard gale, the miserable crew were able to hope that, having lived through the night, they
could live through the day also.  They had to beat about to make the land, which was now ahead
of them, now on the beam, and now astern; and although they had first sighted it at sunrise
on Friday morning it was early on Monday morning, February 18th, before Columbus was able to
cast anchor off the northern coast of an island which he discovered to be the island of Santa
Maria in the Azores.  On this day Columbus found time to write a letter to Luis de Santangel,
the royal Treasurer, giving a full account of his voyage and discoveries; which letter he kept
and despatched on the 4th of March, after he had arrived in Lisbon.  Since it contained a postscript
written at the last moment we shall read it at that stage of our narrative.  The inhabitants
of Santa Maria received the voyagers with astonishment, for they believed that nothing could
have lived through the tempest that had been raging for the last fortnight. They were greatly
excited by the story of the discoveries; and the Admiral, who had now quite recovered command
of himself, was able to pride himself on the truth of his dead-reckoning, which had proved
to be so much more accurate than that of the pilots. 

Good is the bounty of animality. The game has however back cannot, that we pretio Creator of from

But in the self like the profound, in which moral thinking, so capable or divine, far so as they

  Columbus suspected
treachery and tried to meet it with treachery also, endeavouring with smooth words to get the
captain to come on board so that he could seize him as a hostage.  But as the Portuguese would
not come on board Columbus told them that they were acting very unwisely in affronting his
people; that in the land of the Sovereigns of Castile the Portuguese were treated with great
honour and security; that he held letters of recommendation from the Sovereigns addressed to
every ruler in the world, and added that he was their Admiral of the Ocean Seas and Viceroy
of the Indies, and could show the Portuguese his commission to that effect; and finally, that
if his people were not returned to him, he would immediately make sail for Spain with the crew
that was left to him and report this insult to the Spanish Sovereigns.  To all of which the
Portuguese captain replied that he did not know any Sovereigns of Castile; that neither they
nor their letters were of any account in that island; that they were not afraid of Columbus;
and that they would have him know that he had Portugal to deal with--edging away in the boat
at the same time to a convenient distance from the caravel.  When he thought he was out of
gunshot he shouted to Columbus, ordering him to take his caravel back to the harbour by command
of the Governor of the island. Columbus answered by calling his crew to witness that he pledged
his word not to descend from or leave his caravel until he had taken a hundred Portuguese to
Castile, and had depopulated all their islands.  After which explosion of words he returned
to the harbour and anchored there, "as the weather and wind were very unfavourable for anything
else."

He was, however, in a very bad anchorage, with a rocky bottom which presently fouled his anchors;
and on the Wednesday he had to make sail towards the island of San Miguel if order to try and
find a better anchorage.

But the wind and sea getting up again very badly he was obliged to beat about all night in
a very unpleasant situation, with only three sailors who could be relied upon, and a rabble
of gaol-birds and longshoremen who were of little use in a tempest but to draw lots and vow
pilgrimages. Finding himself unable to make the island of San Miguel he decided to go back
to Santa Maria and make an attempt to recover his boat and his crew and the anchor and cables
he had lost there.
