The President of the Night, who is thought to be as clear and quick- lighted as any one of
the whole Club in Things of this Nature, discovered plainly, That the Disturbances therein
set forth, related to those on the Continent:--That Trim could be Nobody but the King of France,
by whole shifting and intriguing Behaviour, all Europe was set together by the Ears:--That
Trim's Wife was certainly the Empress, who are as kind together, says he, as any Man and Wife
can be for their Lives.--The more Shame for 'em, says an Alderman, low to himself.-- Agreeable
to this Key, continues the President,--The Parson, who I think is a most excellent Character,--is
His Most Excellent Majesty King George;--John, the Parish-Clerk, is the King of Prussia; who,
by the Manner of his first entering Saxony, shew'd the World most evidently,-- That he did
know how to lead out the Psalm, and in Tune and Time too, notwithstanding Trim's vile Insult
upon him in that Particular.--But who do you think, says a Surgeon and Man-Midwife, who sat
next him, (whose Coat-Button the President, in the Earnestness of this Explanation, had got
fast hold of, and had thereby partly drawn him over to his Opinion) Who do you think, Mr. President,
says he, are meant by the Church- Wardens, Sides-Men, Mark Slender, Lorry Slim, &c.--Who do
I think? says he, Why,--Why, Sir, as I take the Thing,--the Church-Wardens and Sides- Men,
are the Electors and the other Princes who form the Germanick Body.--And as for the other subordinate
Characters of Mark Slim,--the unlucky Wight in the Plush Breeches,--the Parson's Man who was
so often out of the Way, &c. &c.--these, to be sure, are the several Marshals and Generals,
who fought, or should have fought, under them the last Campaign.--The Men in Buckram, continued
the President, are the Grofs of the King of Prussia's Army, who are as stiff a Body of Men
as are in the World:--And Trim's saying they were twelve, and then nineteen, is a Wipe for
the Brussels Gazetteer, who, to my Knowledge, was never two Weeks in the same Story, about
that or any thing else.

As for the rest of the Romance, continued the President, it sufficiently explains itself,--The
Old-cast-Pair-of-Black-Plush-Breeches must be Saxony, which the Elector, you see, has left
of wearing:--And as for the Great Watch-Coat, which, you know, covers all, it signifies all
Europe; comprehending, at least, so many of its different States and Dominions, as we have
any Concern with in the present War.

I protest, says a Gentleman who sat next but one to the President, and who, it seems, was the
Parson of the Parish, a Member not only of the Political, but also of a Musical Club in the
next Street;--I protest, says he, if this Explanation is right, which I think it is, That the
whole makes a very fine Symbol.--You have always some Musical Instrument or other in your Head,
I think, says the Alderman.--Musical instrument! replies the Parson, in Astonishment,--Mr.
Alderman, I mean an Allegory; and I think the greedy Disposition of Trim and his Wife, in ripping
the Great Watch-Coat to Pieces, in order to convert it into a Petticoat for the one, and a
Jerkin for the other, is one of the most beautiful of the Kind I ever met with; and will shew
all the World what have been the true Views and Intentions of the Houses of Bourbon and Austria
in this abominable Coalition,--I might have called it Whoredom:--Nay, says the Alderman, 'tis
downright Adulterydom, or nothing.

This Hypothesis of the President's explain'd every Thing in the Romance extreamly well; and,
withall, was delivered with so much Readiness and Air of Certainty, as begot an Opinion in
two Thirds of the Club, that Mr. President was actually the Author of the Romance himself:
But a Gentleman who sat on the opposite Side of the Table, who had come piping-hot from reading
the History of King William's and Queen Anne's Wars, and who was thought, at the Bottom, to
envy the President the Honour both of the Romance and Explanation too, gave an entire new Turn
to it all. He acquainted the Club, That Mr. President was altogether wrong in every Supposition
he had made, except that one, where the Great Watch-Coat was said by him to represent Europe,
or at least a great Part of it:--So far he acknowledged he was pretty right; but that he had
not gone far enough backwards into our History to come at the Truth. He then acquainted them,
that the dividing the Great Watch-Coat did, and could, allude to nothing else in the World
but the Partition-Treaty; which, by the Bye, he told them, was the most unhappy and scandalous
Transaction in all King William's Life: It was that false Step, and that only, says he, rising
from his Chair, and striking his Hand upon the Table with great Violence; it was that false
Step, says he, knitting his Brows and throwing his Pipe down upon the Ground, that has laid
the Foundation of all the Disturbances and Sorrows we feel and lament at this very Hour; and
as for Trim's giving up the Breeches, look ye, it is almost Word for Word copied from the French
King and Dauphin's Renunciation of Spain and the West-Indies, which all the World knew (as
was the very Case of the Breeches) were renounced by them on purpose to be reclaim'd when Time
should serve.

This Explanation had too much Ingenuity in it to be altogether slighted; and, in Truth, the
worst Fault it had, seem'd to be the prodigious Heat of it; which (as an Apothecary, who sat
next the Fire, observ'd, in a very low Whisper to his next Neighbour) was so much incorporated
into every Particle of it, that it was impossible, under such Fermentation, it should work
its defined Effect.

This, however, no way intimidated a little valiant Gentleman, though he sat the very next Man,
from giving an Opinion as diametrically opposite as East is from West.

This Gentleman, who was by much the best Geographer in the whole Club, and, moreover, second
Cousin to an Engineer, was positive the Breeches meant Gibraltar; for, if you remember, Gentlemen,
says he, tho' possibly you don't, the Ichnography and Plan of that Town and Fortress, it exactly
resembles a Pair of Trunk-Hose, the two Promontories forming the two Slops, &c. &c.--Now we
all know, continued he, that King George the First made a Promise of that important Pass to
the King of Spain:--So that the whole Drift of the Romance, according to my Sense of Things,
is merely to vindicate the King and the Parliament in that Transaction, which made so much
Noise in the World.

A Wholesale Taylor, who from the Beginning had resolved not to speak at all in the Debate,--was
at last drawn into it, by something very unexpected in the last Person's Argument.

He told the Company, frankly, he did not understand what Ichnography meant:--But as for the
Shape of a Pair of Breeches, as he had had the Advantage of cutting out so many hundred Pairs
in his Life-Time, he hoped he might be allowed to know as much of the Matter as another Man.
