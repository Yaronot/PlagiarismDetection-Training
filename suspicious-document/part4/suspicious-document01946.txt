"We can't choose for our brothers," said Miss Letitia, "and, hard as it is, we must make up
our minds to love those they bring to us. Who knows what good influences may do for poor Lillie
Ellis? She never has had any yet. Her family are extremely common sort of people, without any
culture or breeding, and only her wonderful beauty brought them into notice; and they have
always used that as a sort of stock in trade."

"And John says, in this letter, that she reminds him of our mother," said Miss Grace; "and
he thinks that naturally she was very much such a character. Just think of that, now!"

"He must be far gone," said Miss Ferguson; "but then, you see, she is distractingly pretty.
She has just the most exquisitely pearly, pure, delicate, saint-like look, at times, that you
ever saw; and then she knows exactly how she does look, and just how to use her looks; and
John can't be blamed for believing in her. I, who know all about her, am sometimes taken in
by her."

"Well," said Miss Grace, "Mrs. Lennox was at Newport last summer at the time that she was there,
and she told me all about her. I think her an artful, unscrupulous, unprincipled woman, and
her being made mistress of this house just breaks up our pleasant sociable life here. She has
no literary tastes; she does not care for reading or study; she won't like our set here, and
she will gradually drive them from the house. She won't like me, and she will want to alienate
John from me,--so there is just the situation."

"You may read that letter," added Miss Grace, wiping her eyes, and tossing her brother's letter
into Miss Letitia's lap. That the writing he is the negligé. He is there was the autobiography to which
have the pleasant and spiritual hem of character.

CHAPTER III.

THE SISTER.

Grace Seymour was a specimen of a class of whom we are happy to say New England possesses a
great many.

She was a highly cultivated, intelligent, and refined woman, arrived at the full age of mature
womanhood unmarried, and with no present thought or prospect of marriage. I presume all my
readers, who are in a position to run over the society of our rural New-England towns, can
recall to their minds hundreds of such. They are women too thoughtful, too conscientious, too
delicate, to marry for any thing but a purely personal affection; and this affection, for various
reasons, has not fallen in their way.

The tendency of life in these towns is to throw the young men of the place into distant fields
of adventure and enterprise in the far Western and Southern States, leaving at their old homes
a population in which the feminine element largely predominates. It is not, generally speaking,
the most cultivated or the most attractive of the brethren who remain in the place where they
were born. The ardent, the daring, the enterprising, are off to the ends of the earth; and
the choice of the sisters who remain at home is, therefore, confined to a restricted list;
and so it ends in these delightful rose-gardens of single women which abound in New England,--women
who remain at home as housekeepers to aged parents, and charming persons in society; women
over whose graces of conversation and manner the married men in their vicinity go off into
raptures of eulogium, which generally end with, "Why hasn't that woman ever got married?"

It often happens to such women to expend on some brother that stock of hero-worship and devotion
which it has not come in their way to give to a nearer friend. Alas! it is building on a sandy
foundation; for, just as the union of hearts is complete, the chemical affinity which began
in the cradle, and strengthens with every year of life, is dissolved by the introduction of
that third element which makes of the brother a husband, while the new combination casts out
the old,--sometimes with a disagreeable effervescence.

John and Grace Seymour were two only children of a very affectionate family; and they had grown
up in the closest habits of intimacy. They had written to each other those long letters in
which thoughtful people who live in retired situations delight; letters not of outward events,
but of sentiments and opinions, the phases of the inner life. They had studied and pursued
courses of reading together. They had together organized and carried on works of benevolence
and charity.

The brother and sister had been left joint heirs of a large manufacturing property, employing
hundreds of hands, in their vicinity; and the care and cultivation of these work-people, the
education of their children, had been most conscientiously upon their minds. Half of every
Sunday they devoted together to labors in the Sunday school of their manufacturing village;
and the two worked so harmoniously together in the interests of their life, that Grace had
never felt the want of any domestic ties or relations other than those that she had.

Our readers may perhaps, therefore, concede that, among the many claimants for their sympathy
in this cross-grained world of ours, some few grains of it may properly be due to Grace.

Things are trials that try us: afflictions are what afflict us; and, under this showing, Grace
was both tried and afflicted by the sudden engagement of her brother. When the whole groundwork
on which one's daily life is built caves in, and falls into the cellar without one moment's
warning, it is not in human nature to pick one's self up, and reconstruct and rearrange in
a moment. So Grace thought, at any rate; but she made a hurried effort to dash back her tears,
and gulp down a rising in her throat, anxious only not to be selfish, and not to disgust her
brother in the outset with any personal egotism.

So she ran to the front door to meet him, and fell into his arms, trying so hard to seem congratulatory
and affectionate that she broke out into sobbing.

"My dear Gracie," said John, embracing and kissing her with that gushing fervor with which
newly engaged gentlemen are apt to deluge every creature whom they meet, "you've got my letter.
Well, were not you astonished?"

"O John, it was so sudden!" was all poor Grace could say. "And you know, John, since mother
died, you and I have been all in all to each other."

"And so we shall be, Gracie. Why, yes, of course we shall," he said, stroking her hair, and
playing with her trembling, thin, white hands. "Why, this only makes me love you the more now;
and you will love my little Lillie: fact is, you can't help it. We shall both of us be happier
for having her here."

"Well, you know, John, I never saw her," said Grace, deprecatingly, "and so you can't wonder."

"Oh, yes, of course! Don't wonder in the least. It comes rather sudden,--and then you haven't
seen her. Look, here is her photograph!" said John, producing one from the most orthodox innermost
region, directly over his heart. "Look there! isn't it beautiful?"

"It is a very sweet face," said Grace, exerting herself to be sympathetic, and thankful that
she could say that much truthfully.

"I can't imagine," said John, "what ever made her like me. You know she has refused half the
fellows in the country. I hadn't the remotest idea that she would have any thing to say to
me; but you see there's no accounting for tastes;" and John plumed himself, as young gentlemen
do who have carried off prizes.

"You see," he added, "it's odd, but she took a fancy to me the first time she saw me. Now,
you know, Gracie, I never found it easy to get along with ladies at first; but Lillie has the
most extraordinary way of putting a fellow at his ease. Why, she made me feel like an old friend
the first hour."

"Indeed!"

"Look here," said John, triumphantly drawing out his pocket-book, and producing thence a knot
of rose-colored satin ribbon. "Did you ever see such a lovely color as this? It's so exquisite,
you see! Well, she always is wearing just such knots of ribbon, the most lovely shades. Why,
there isn't one woman in a thousand could wear the things she does. Every thing becomes her.
Sometimes it's rose color, or lilac, or pale blue,--just the most trying things to others are
what she can wear."

"Dear John, I hope you looked for something deeper than the complexion in a wife," said Grace,
driven to moral reflections in spite of herself.

"Oh, of course!" said John: "she has such soft, gentle, winning ways; she is so sympathetic;
she's just the wife to make home happy, to be a bond of union to us all. Now, in a wife, what
we want is just that. Lillie's mind, for instance, hasn't been cultivated as yours and Letitia's.
She isn't at all that sort of girl. She's just a dear, gentle, little confiding creature, that
you'll delight in. You'll form her mind, and she'll look up to you. You know she's young yet."

"Young, John! Why, she's seven and twenty," said Grace, with astonishment.

"Oh, no, my dear Gracie! that is all a mistake. She told me herself she's only twenty. You
see, the trouble is, she went into company injudiciously early, a mere baby, in fact; and that
causes her to have the name of being older than she is. But, I do assure you, she's only twenty.
She told me so herself."

"Oh, indeed!" said Grace, prudently choking back the contradiction which she longed to utter.
"I know it seems a good many summers since I heard of her as a belle at Newport."

"Ah, yes, exactly! You see she went into company, as a young lady, when she was only thirteen.
She told me all about it. Her parents were very injudicious, and they pushed her forward. She
regrets it now. She knows that it wasn't the thing at all. She's very sensitive to the defects
in her early education; but I made her understand that it was the heart more than the head
that I cared for. I dare say, Gracie, she'll fall into all our little ways without really knowing;
and you, in point of fact, will be mistress of the house as much as you ever were. Lillie is
delicate, and never has had any care, and will be only too happy to depend on you. She's one
of the gentle, dependent sort, you know."

To this statement, Grace did not reply. She only began nervously sweeping together the débris
of leaves and flowers which encumbered the table, on which the newly arranged flower-vases
were standing. Then she arranged the vases with great precision on the mantel-shelf. As she
was doing it, so many memories rushed over her of that room and her mother, and the happy,
peaceful family life that had hitherto been led there, that she quite broke down; and, sitting
down in the chair, she covered her face, and went off in a good, hearty crying spell.

Poor John was inexpressibly shocked. He loved and revered his sister beyond any thing in the
world; and it occurred to him, in a dim wise, that to be suddenly dispossessed and shut out
in the cold, when one has hitherto been the first object of affection, is, to make the best
of it, a real and sore trial.

But Grace soon recovered herself, and rose up smiling through her tears. "What a fool I am
making of myself!" she said. "The fact is, John, I am only a little nervous. You mustn't mind
it. You know," she said, laughing, "we old maids are like cats,--we find it hard to be put
out of our old routine. I dare say we shall all of us be happier in the end for this, and I
shall try to do all I can to make it so. Perhaps, John, I'd better take that little house of
mine on Elm Street, and set up my tent in it, and take all the old furniture and old pictures,
and old-time things. If Fénelon.

"It's too bad, now, to take you from your letter," said Miss Clippins, with a sly nod.

"I'm sure you take it philosophically," said Miss Nippins, with a giggle.

"Why shouldn't I?" said the divine Lillie. "I get one every day; and it's all the old story.
I've heard it ever since I was born."

"Well, now, to be sure you have. Let's see," said Miss Clippins, "this is the seventy-fourth
or seventy-fifth offer, was it?"

"Oh, you must ask mamma! she keeps the lists: I'm sure I don't trouble my head," said the little
beauty; and she looked so natty and jaunty when she said it, just arching her queenly white
neck, and making soft, downy dimples in her cheeks as she gave her fresh little childlike laugh;
turning round and round before the looking-glass, and issuing her orders for the fitting of
the jacket with a precision and real interest which showed that there were things in the world
which didn't become old stories, even if one had been used to them ever since one was born.

Lillie never was caught napping when the point in question was the fit of her clothes.

When released from the little blue jacket, there was a rose-colored morning-dress to be tried
on, and a grave discussion as to whether the honiton lace was to be set on plain or frilled.

So important was this case, that mamma was summoned from the sewing-machine to give her opinion.
Mrs. Ellis was a fat, fair, rosy matron of most undisturbed conscience and digestion, whose
main business in life had always been to see to her children's clothes. She had brought up
Lillie with faithful and religious zeal; that is to say, she had always ruffled her underclothes
with her own hands, and darned her stockings, sick or well; and also, as before intimated,
kept a list of her offers, which she was ready in confidential moments to tell off to any of
her acquaintance. The question of ruffled or plain honiton was of such vital importance, that
the whole four took some time in considering it in its various points of view.

"Sarah Selfridge had hers ruffled," said Lillie.

"And the effect was perfectly sweet," said Miss Clippins.

"Perhaps, Lillie, you had better have it ruffled," said mamma.
