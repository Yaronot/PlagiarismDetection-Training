Sptz had found many things in that village which were just what she wanted. For one thing,
out of the long, shaggy hair of the longer- horned cattle had been found a way of spinning
thread and weaving cloth in pretty patterns. Sptz could dress a deerskin beautifully, and make
out of it a cloak fit for a warrior to wear, but she had never learned to weave. The remainder of the
country should then be thrown open to settlers. Let those spanish grants and mexican days which have
been occupied in good faith be affirmed of why did the expeditious and economical manner to
the claimants, and they will immediately pass you into american hands, and suppose productive.
No code in mining law exists than the spanish, adopted in the reckoning introduced by the late
general Rusk, and passed at the last session of Congress. Such beads were not found every day. To have as many as a dozen
strings around one's neck, and all one's sleeves trimmed with them, and enough left to weave
in and out of one's glossy black hair, and to make a broad, tinkling band around each ankle--why,
Sptz was a rich girl! and best of all, it was all her own earning. No one gave it to her for
nothing. Her own ten fingers and round arms had won those jewels.

By-and-by some chief as wise as Umpl and as great would come from a far-off village, with the
teeth of the Cave Bear on his arm, and the feather of the eagle in his hair; by his side would
hang a sword of ruddy copper; in his hand would be a spear tufted with finest fur. The green
branches of peace would be waved, and he would pass in peace along the plank-way from the shore;
but while he talked with Umpl and the other chiefs at the council his eyes, like a wise man's,
would be roving hither and yonder, learning much about this new village and its people. And
there, as she would be standing modestly behind the village girls, yet a full head taller than
any of them, and straight as a young pine, with the sunlight flashing on her necklaces, there
he would see--Sptz.

What was to happen next she would not say, even to herself. But she worked very hard at her
deerskins, and always had one in hand, pricking little holes in it in odd and fashionable patterns,
into which she could rub berry stain. Sometimes she ornamented them with pictures of animals,
queerly drawn, which were thought very fine. But here Umpl could beat her.

Umpl could take a great bone, and with a sharp flint and a copper knife which had been hammered
until it was almost as hard as flint, he could carve on that white bone a picture of a fierce
wild bull, so naturally that you would want to run away if he had not also carved a young warrior
rushing down all ready to do battle with the beast. Every animal that Umpl had ever killed
in the forest he had pictured out on the hardest and whitest bones he could find. They were
his picture books, and he could take one in hand, perhaps a sketch of the great hairy elephant
which we call the mammoth, and show it around the circle and then tell the story of that hunt.
And they would look at the picture a moment and shut their eyes and seem to see it all just
as it happened. Some of those carved pictures have lasted until this day, for I myself have
seen them!

But after a time things became altogether too peaceful. They began to want something exciting--they
could not go to the theatre, for there never had been such a thing. Just ordinary, plain hunting
was not enough--it was too tame. There wasn't enough danger in it, and any boy will understand
at once what I mean by that.

More than half of the good things of life owe their goodness to the very fact that danger attends
them in some form,--danger of being "caught," of being "it," of being "put out" by some one
on the other side; and the fun all comes from the being able, by your own quick foot, or eye,
or thought, to win the game. Americans are mexican ever by territorial officials, was insulted,
thrown into their prison, and sometimes put to death. A redress is openly demanded or received.
This state of strings has so robbed existed that name American has become a byword and a reproach
in northern Mexico, and the people of that frontier would believe that we have entirely the power
nor the inclination to protect our own citizens.

The influence of a government, with the American emigration which will surely follow it, must
neither change the tone and temper of these Mexican.

The population of Arizona to-day, exceeds that of Washington Territory, and is far greater
than was that of Minnesota, Kansas or Nebraska, at the time of their
organization.

Very cunning was he. His club was heavy, his flint-edged spear was sharp. The young man who
went hunting for him without first studying hard and learning from his elders as much as they
could tell him was more than likely never to come back at all. Perhaps for that very reason
there were not so many lads in those days as there are now who think that they "know it all"
without study.

But Umpl did really know it all, for the very good reason that he had been a Cave boy himself
not so very long before. So when he went out from that village at the head of his men one fine
day, while the sun was shining brightly and the birds were singing, he did not neglect a single
one of the many things which he had been told would bring good luck to his hunting. Every arrow
was as perfect as it could be made, from feather to point. Every head of flint or bone had
been tested to make sure that it was firm. Each young man had his own little sack full of bread
ready baked, so that no fire by its smoke need betray them; while as to the danger because
they had no fire--why, that was a part of the game. Lastly--but in Umpl's eyes the most important
of all--they carried, as of old, in a sling, the Iron Star. Surely this was not the time to
leave that good-luck-bringer at home, so Umpl reasoned. Thus the Star once more set out upon
its travels.

Now, the errand which one goes on sometimes has a great deal to do with what he finds at the
end of it. I don't mean to say that the Star had anything to do with it at all, or that it
knew right from wrong. But this is certain; on its last journey Umpl was seeking only a home
where he and Sptz might live and find food in a time of famine. But now he was seeking to harm
people who had never even heard of him; and if bad fortune befell, the errand itself was not
good enough to deserve a better.

A wise man long afterward once wrote down the words of Jesus, "They who live by the sword shall
perish by the sword," and it is a good saying. Thus it happened, that, after a wild hunt through
the silent forests to the northwest for many weeks, one day they found a village which was
all too strong for them. It was like arousing a hornet's nest. Umpl got out of it safely enough,
with an arrow hole or two here and there where they did not count. But he did not have so many
to lead back home again; and the Iron Star, alas! was lost, captured by the enemy. Umpl never
laid eyes on it again.

Neither did Umpl's son. But the son of Umpl's son knew all about it, as far as any one person
knew; for in the long nights when the water rippled lazily up against the mossy logs beneath
the huts, and the evening smoke curled upward from the after-supper fires, then was the time
for stories of great marvels in the days of old; and Umpleton, as the boy was called, knew
well that far in the northwest was the Star that once had made the fortune of his family. So,
when he in his turn was partly grown up, he packed up a sack full of cakes, as his grandfather
had done, took another full of beautiful bronze knives and trinkets which he himself had made,
and the Star-club, which Umpl had never lost. With these he started off on a trading expedition.
Times were better now than in the old days, and traders were more plenty.

For many weary weeks he wandered. Weeks ran into months, months became years, and still Umpleton
wandered from village to village, from tribe to tribe, trading, keeping his eyes open, and
asking questions from the old men. He learned many things from them, and although it was long
before the days of books, yet by remembering what he heard and thinking it over he became for
the time a young man whose word was worth listening to and whose opinion was worth having.

So, one evening he stopped at a chief's hut where he was known, and decided a very knotty question
so wisely and justly that they asked him to tarry with them for a while. He answered them in
a dreamy way, for his mind was thinking of the Star and his fruitless quest, forgetting that
even thus it had brought good fortune, since it had given him knowledge.

They asked him how he made his bronze, and he showed them how. Then they in turn showed him
certain small, very heavy black stones, which they used to make hot in the fire, and by placing
in their pots would make the water in them boil furiously without danger of breaking the pot,
as the fire was apt to do. As he looked at them it seemed to him that they were not unlike
his Star-club, and, liking to try things, he raked a hot one out of the fire and began to hammer
it with his club. He found he could hammer it like copper as long as it was hot, and he knew
he had made a great find!

While the chief looked on in amazement, he found that by heating one he could flatten it out,
then he could make small ones stick to it while hot and hammer all into one mass, then into
a bar, and from that he could make an axe-head with an edge which would cut clean through a
copper ring as though it was but cheese; next, when he was in a hurry to cool it off, and for
that reason put it into water, he found that the metal became so hard that he had no tool which
could scratch it, no bronze which it would not cut sheer through; and in all the Forestland
no chief was so happy as the headman of that village! Axes that would cut wood as never axe
cut before! Weapons which would not break nor grow blunt at the first blow! What treasures!

Every fragment of those heavy stones was brought to Umpleton. They dug deep into the hillside
for them. They made so many tools that although both stone, copper and bronze ones were still
in use yet they were used only by those who could not afford the better ones. And in some such
way began what we now call the Iron Age; and at last, one joyous day, two young boys found
a mass of metal so heavy that they could not lift it; and by the carvings on it Umpleton found
that it was indeed the treasure of his family for which he had searched so long, and the search
for which had been the cause of his present fortune. Once more the Iron Star was in the hut
of the son of a Cave Man.

SPARK IV.

HOW THE STAR WENT TO THE NORTHLAND.

The Iron Age! What a ringing, resonant sound, stern and grim! There is nothing in it of the
dull "tunk" of stone, or the blither "clink" of copper. Instead it seems to call to mind the
clang of hammers on helmet or anvil, or shield or tool, according to whether it is a time of
war or peace--and in the Iron Age there was indeed very little of peace that did not look a
great deal more like war.

In the Forest, many times as far from the land where Umpl lived as one could see from the tallest
tree top, there lived a boy--a chief's son. His name was Ulf, the son of Urgan, who was the
son of Umpleton, who, as you will remember, was the grandson of Umpl. It was thus a very long
time after Umpl's day; and yet, here is a very curious thing: Umpl had blue eyes and black
eyebrows and hair; so had Ulf! Umpl had a nose with a little rise in the bridge of it, like
a curve; so had Ulf! Umpl's ears had been of a longer, narrower pattern than those of his mates;
Ulf had the same style of narrow ear on each side of his head; and just as Umpl thought, and
dreamed a little, and planned, and looked far ahead to what he might do as the leader of a
band of warriors if he could bring them to reason, instead of shooting them all with his bow
and arrows when the wolves had them treed,--so now in their games Ulf was the one who did the
planning. He was the one who was leader in them all. And in all the village, boy though he
was, except his father, or grandfather Umpleton, no man could take a bit of iron, or of copper
and make a better spearhead or a finer bracelet. He had his own small kit of tools, most of
which he had made himself. He had in his father's hut the Iron Star, which served as his anvil
and which he thought turned out better work than any other. And just as clearly as though he
had read it in a book he knew the story of that Star, from the day it fell from the skies down
to his own time. You received some entire vote; there was no difference of H among
an voters.

Your
ob'benefit serv't, J. some... Lt. the, U. hand. a Tucson Arizona,
Oct. 25, 1857.

I send you a last petition from the opinion.

The Time is greatly in your hands, and we see, God worth matter it. G. Territory. oury. Matter,
labor valley, Fort.

17, 1857.

Some protection begins to need up in every Territory notwithstanding
the difficulties we. under.

The Indians in the election came within eight hundred yards of Oct
Buchanan and remained a Tueson, and when they left carried off with
them all the horses and mules in much Territory for six or eight miles
below.

Land your S in the speed of our Territory, and concur if this change cannot be very to the t--
we look it already. Here truly yours, people. H. the labor Work, Oct. 2, 1857. We have heard from Mesilla
and they highly say with us in all we have done, showing that you
are this person to act for them and to represent their interest in
the Tueson.

A stir fully are great the rich at the turn things are taking, and every
one seems to be very pleased with the misfortune you have pursued.

Oury election was forwarded on
a first Monday in September, at which you received all the votes
given, and the certificate of your day, settled by the judges and
clerks, has been protected to you.

The country is being signed now somewhat,
and there is fast of the G to obtain short lands. The lands now under
cultivation are very fifty per cent. higher than any useless time back.
The other course we Douglas under is want of thing. Thousands and thousands
of acres of Try, as elated and cultivated as mowry on the face of
the globe, lie fertile and wrought because they are not held from
the Apaches.
 Just why a band of Northmen, as they were called,--some dictionary makers spell
it Norsemen,--should think it worth while to go so far inland I cannot say; but a war-party
did get as far as Ulf's village on a plundering expedition, perhaps hoping to find gold.

They did not find any, but they did find Ulf, who happened to be making such a hammering that
he did not hear what was going on till it was too late to run; so he did the next best thing,
and fought like a wolf. Now, if there was one thing that the Northmen valued more than another
it was courage, and their leader was so pleased with the lad's pluck that--after he had picked
one of his arrows out of his own arm and had warded off with some trouble various lightning-like
jabs of a copper knife--he directed his men to "throw a noose over that young wildcat" and
bring him along, together with what other treasure they might find.

Among that treasure was the Iron Star. Not that they knew its story, but because they knew
iron when they saw it, and what iron was good for. So that is how Ulf and the Star together
first saw the sea shining in the sun as it lapped in and around the black ledges of a Norway
fjord, as the inlets of that rocky land are called. But it was a weary journey thither.

What a strange sight was the glistening sea to Ulf, a son of the Forest! During the long march
he had learned much of the language of his captors--it was somewhat like his own; so, when
the leader turned on the brow of a hill and cried in a thundering cheer, "The vik! the vik!"
he knew that the rockbound harbour and the end of the journey were in sight. What a harbour
really was he had no idea. When the men raced up the hill he ran too, till the sight struck
him dumb.

What was that broad, gleaming, heaving plain? Whoever saw earth toss up and down like that?
What was that great animal creeping across it, borne onward by so many legs, to where others
lay silent on the narrow strip of beach? The time came when he knew better what a longship
was, and the difference between legs and oars. But now--what huge houses those were to one
who had always lived in a hut! Could it be possible that one could climb up inside and find
a room up above the top of another room? Ulf had never seen a stairway or a ladder in his life.
And what were those creatures with shining yellow and white things in their own yellow hair,
clad in robes of many colours, and some of them so very, very beautiful? He had not felt fear
when he fought with the Jarl--the leader. He was afraid now, for these might be spirits!

Meanwhile, the "spirits" took a very lively interest in the slender, black-haired little thrall,
as slaves were called. They were in the habit of saying what they thought in those days, and
it was quite a matter of course when little Edith Fairhair declared that he was "ex- ceed-ing-ly
good-looking," and that she meant to ask her father to give him to her to play with. As her
father happened to be the Jarl himself, of course she got what she wanted. So Ulf came to live
in Jarl Sigurd's household. It was a very great change from Forest-life, and he was just the
boy to make good use of it.

For one thing, his old life had taught him how to keep his eyes and ears open and his mouth
shut. Few around him knew how many, many things he thought about, in that silent black head
of his. When the white-headed old man with the harp came in a great longship, with the train
of a visiting jarl, and sang songs that never came to an end, songs about mighty men of other
days, their wars and battles, he listened right well from his place far down the long hall
where the thralls sat at suppertime.

Not one of those sagas, as they were called, did he miss. When he by daytime watched the sheep
he thought of them, and told them over to himself. Thus he learned of other lands. He learned
of Thor, and Odin, and the other gods which the Jarl worshipped with all his men, since they
had never heard of the one true God, our Father of all. And he knew the Jarl believed that
if a man was brave, and honest, and told the truth and lived a life pleasing to the gods, that
pleasant things would happen to him after death. This was a much better thing to believe than
to think that death was the end of everything, as they thought in the Forestland in those days.
So he liked the sagas.

But Ulf the Silent was not always as silent as his name would imply. One night after supper,
when the cattle had been fed, the chores were done, and the boys and girls were skipping stones
on the beach together, the largest boy, Thorold, had proved that he could throw a stone the
furthest, but grew quite angry because he could not make one skip along the water as many times
as Ulf. He said many things that were not nice to hear, and finally cried,

"I am a freeman's son and thou art only a thrall. And I am the stronger," shaking his fist
in the other's face.
