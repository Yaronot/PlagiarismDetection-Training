And by this account of his diligence to make his parishioners understand what they prayed,
and why they praised and adored their Creator, I hope I shall the more easily obtain the Reader's
belief to the following account of Mr. Herbert's own practice; which was to appear constantly
with his wife and three nieces--the daughters of a deceased sister--and his whole family, twice
every day at the Church-prayers in the Chapel, which does almost join to his Parsonage-house.
And for the time of his appearing, it was strictly at the canonical hours of ten and four:
and then and there he lifted up pure and charitable hands to God in the midst of the congregation.
And he would joy to have spent that time in that place, where the honour of his Master Jesus
dwelleth; and there, by that inward devotion which he testified constantly by an humble behaviour
and visible adoration, he, like Joshua, brought not only "his own household thus to serve the
Lord;" but brought most of his parishioners, and many gentlemen in the neighbourhood, constantly
to make a part of his congregation twice a day: and some of the meaner sort of his parish did
so love and reverence Mr. Herbert, that they would let their plough rest when Mr. Herbert's
Saint's-bell rung to prayers, that they might also offer their devotions to God with him; and
would then return back to their plough. And his most holy life was such, that it begot such
reverence to God, and to him, that they thought themselves the happier, when they carried Mr.
Herbert's blessing back with them to their labour. Thus powerful was his reason and example
to persuade others to a practical piety and devotion.

And his constant public prayers did never make him to neglect his own private devotions, nor
those prayers that he thought himself bound to perform with his family, which always were a
set form, and not long; and he did always conclude them with a Collect which the Church hath
appointed for the day or week.--Thus he made every day's sanctity a step towards that kingdom,
where impurity cannot enter.

And as his desire to enjoy his Heaven upon earth drew him twice every week to Salisbury, so
his walks thither were the occasion of many happy accidents to others; of which I will mention
some few.

In one of his walks to Salisbury he overtook a gentleman, that is still living in that City;
and in their walk together, Mr. Herbert took a fair occasion to talk with him, and humbly begged
to be excused, if he asked him some account of his faith; and said, "I do this the rather,
because though you are not of my parish, yet I receive tythe from you by the hand of your tenant;
and, Sir, I am the bolder to do it, because I know there be some sermon-hearers that be like
those fishes, that always live in salt water, and yet are always fresh."

After which expression, Mr. Herbert asked him some needful questions, and having received his
answer, gave him such rules for the trial of his sincerity, and for a practical piety, and
in so loving and meek a manner, that the gentleman did so fall in love with him, and his discourse,
that he would often contrive to meet him in his walk to Salisbury, or to attend him back to
Bemerton; and still mentions the name of Mr. George Herbert with veneration, and still praiseth
God for the occasion of knowing him.

[Sidenote: The cure for indifference]

In another of his Salisbury walks, he met with a neighbour Minister; and after some friendly
discourse betwixt them, and some condolement for the decay of piety, and too general contempt
of the Clergy, Mr. Herbert took occasion to say,

"One cure for these distempers would be, for the Clergy themselves to keep the Ember-weeks
strictly, and beg of their parishioners to join with them in fasting and prayers for a more
religious Clergy.

"And another cure would be, for themselves to restore the great and neglected duty of Catechising,
on which the Salvation of so many of the poor and ignorant lay-people does depend; but principally,
that the Clergy themselves would be sure to live unblameably; and that the dignified Clergy
especially which preach temperance, would avoid surfeiting and take all occasions to express
a visible humility and charity in their lives; for this would force a love and an imitation,
and an unfeigned reverence from all that knew them to be such." (And for proof of this, we
need no other testimony than the life and death of Dr. Lake,[24] late Lord Bishop of Bath and
Wells.) "This," said Mr. Herbert, "would be a cure for the wickedness and growing Atheism of
our age. And, my dear brother, till this be done by us, and done in earnest, let no man expect
a reformation of the manners of the Laity; for 'tis not learning, but this, this only that
must do it; and, till then, the fault must lie at our doors."

[Sidenote: The Good Samaritan]

In another walk to Salisbury, he saw a poor man with a poorer horse, that was fallen under
his load: they were both in distress, and needed present help; which Mr. Herbert perceiving,
put off his canonical coat, and helped the poor man to unload, and after to load, his horse.
The poor man blessed him for it, and he blessed the poor man; and was so like the Good Samaritan,
that he gave him money to refresh both himself and his horse; and told him, "That if he loved
himself he should be merciful to his beast." Thus he left the poor man: and at his coming to
his musical friends at Salisbury, they began to wonder that Mr. George Herbert, which used
to be so trim and clean, came into that company so soiled and discomposed: but he told them
the occasion. And now let's tune our instruments."

Thus, as our blessed Saviour, after his Resurrection, did take occasion to interpret the Scripture
to Cleopas, and that other Disciple, which he met with and accompanied in their journey to
Emmaus; so Mr. Herbert, in his path toward Heaven, did daily take any fair occasion to instruct
the ignorant, or comfort any that were in affliction; and did always confirm his precepts,
by shewing humility and mercy, and ministering grace to the hearers. 

His first work was, therefore, written in French measure, and is entitled
"Speculum Meditantis."

There are two copies of this book now in the Bodleian Library at
Oxford.

It contains ten books, and consists of a collection of precepts and examples, compiled from various
authors, recommending the chastity of the marriage bed.

Gower's next work was a Latin production, entitled, "Vox Clamantis," of which there are many copies still
extant. The unfortunate reign of the poet's royal patron, and the rebellion of Wat Tyler, furnished
Gower with ample materials for this publication.-- The "Confessio Amantis" was first printed
in the year 1403, by Caxton.

There is a MS. in Trinity College, Cambridge, consisting of several small poems by Gower; but they
are nearly destitute of merit. The French sonnets, however, of which there is a volume in the
Marquess of Stafford's library, are spoken of by Mr. Warton, who has given a long account of them,
with specimens, as possessing more merit.

The "Boke of Philip Sparrow," by the witty, but obscene Skelton, who wrote towards the close of the
fifteenth century, says that "Gower's Englishe is old;" but the learned Dean Collet, in the early
part of the succeeding century, studied not only Gower, but Chaucer, and even Lydgate, in order
to improve and correct his own style. By the close of that century, however, the language
of these writers was become entirely obsolete.

The "Confessio Amantis" was printed, a second time, by Barthelet, in the year 1532; a third time
in 1544; a fourth in 1554; and, lastly, in a very correct and worthy manner, in the year 1810, under
the judicious inspection of Dr. Chalmers.

It were ungrateful to withhold from Gower some acknowledgment of the share he had in producing a beneficial
revolution in the English language; as it would be absurd and untrue to attribute to him any
great degree of praise, as an inventor in that important work.*****
The church of St. Saviour was founded before the conquest, but was
principally rebuilt in the fourteenth century, since which time it
has undergone many extensive reparations at different periods.

The tower, which is surmounted by four pinnacles, was repaired in
1818 and 1819; and the choir has been recently restored in conformity
with the original design, under the superintendence of that indefatigable
architect, Mr. George Gwilt.

[2] The dramatists, Fletcher and Massinger were buried in this church in one grave; and from
the tower, Hollar drew his Views of London, both before and after the fire. [2] Only the tower
and the choir have yet been restored; but the fidelity with which these portions have been executed,
heightens our anxiety for the renovation of the whole structure. The repairs of the south transept will,
we believe, be shortly commenced, but the fate of the nave and aisles is not yet decided. These
are in a dilapidated condition. Mr. Gwilt has already expended much time and research into the
history of this very interesting structure.

On our last week-day visit to the church, we saw the fine arch of a Saxon
door just uncovered after a concealment of many ages, in one of the
surveys of this erudite artist, who is sedulously attached to the
study of antiquities, and is an honour to his profession.

We ought not to forget the altar-screen which has lately been restored under
Mr. Gwilt's superintendence.

Indeed, the inspection of this venerable fabric will repay a walk
from the most remote corner of the metropolis.

Besides the tomb of Gower, there are monuments to Launcelot Andrews, Bishop of Winchester; Richard
Humble, Alderman of London, erected in 1616; and several others. Gower's monument was once very
splendid, but its present state is not very indicative of the gratitude of the parish in which
he perpetuated his munificence by erecting one of the finest churches in the metropolis.***** A
SECOND CHAPTER ON KISSING. BY A NOVICE IN THE ART. Par. Lost, b. 4, 1. 499-- 502.-------- Kissing
the world begun, And I hope it will never be done Old Song. Kissing has been practised in various
modes, and for various purposes, from a period of very remote antiquity.

Among the ancient oriental nations, presents from a superior were saluted by kissing, to express
gratitude and submission to the person conferring the favour. Reference is made to this custom,
Genesis, ch. xl. v. 41, "According to thy words shall my people be ruled;" or, as the margin, supported
by most eminent critics, renders it, "At thy mouth shall my people
kiss."

The
consecration of the Jewish kings to the regal authority was sealed
by a kiss from the officiator in the ceremony: 1 Sam. ch. x. v. 1.

Kissing was also employed in the heathen worship as a religious rite.

Cicero mentions a statue of Hercules, the chin and lips of which
were considerably worn by the repeated kissing of the worshippers.

When too far removed to be approached in this manner, it was usual
to place the right hand upon the statue, and return it to the lips.

That traces of these customs remain to the present day, kissing the Testament
on oath in our courts of judicature, and kissing the hand as a respectful
salute, afford sufficient evidence.

But it is with kissing as a mode of expressing affection or endearment
that we are principally concerned, and its use, as such, is of equal
(perhaps greater) antiquity with any of the preceding usages.

To the passage cited, MIRROR, No. 357, by Professor Childe Wilful, on this subject, may be added
the meeting of Telemachus and Ulysses on the return of the latter from Troy, as described, Odyssey,
lib. 16, v. 186-- 218; and the history of the courtship of the patriarch Jacob and the "fair
damsel" Rachel, Genesis, ch. xxix. v. 11. This last authority, though it must be acknowledged
not so classical as the foregoing, is nevertheless much more piquant, being perhaps the oldest
record of amorous kissing extant. Thou seest, therefore, courteous reader, that this "divine custom,"
in addition to the claims upon thee which it intrinsically possesseth, and which are neither few
nor small, hath moreover the universal suffrage of the highest antiquity; thou seest that its
date, so far from being confined to the Trojan or Saxon age, can with certainty be traced to patriarchal
times; yea, verily, and I cannot find it in me to rest here, without conducting thee to an era
even more remote. Revert thine eye to the motto at the head of this chapter. Doth it not
carry thee back in spirit to the very baby hours of creation, the "good old days of Adam and Eve?"
and doth it not represent unto thee this delightful art as known and practised in full perfection,
"when young time told his first birth-days by the sun?" I grant thee that such an authority is
not sufficiently critical to fix with precision the "ab initio" of the custom; yet doth it not
possess infinite claim upon thy credence? and more especially when thou considerest that, our respectable
progenitors, the antediluvians, were visited with the deluge of waters for little else than
their license. Vide chap. vi. of the first book of Moses called Genesis, passim. In a world,
of which almost all we know with certainty is its uncertainty, and
that "the fashion thereof passeth away," it is only a natural inquiry
whether the custom of kissing hath, like most others, undergone any material
alteration. Perhaps from its nature, it is as little subjected to
versatility from the lapse of ages as any; yet still, to say that
it has experienced some change, would not be hazarding a very improbable
opinion.

Who knows but the "clamorous smack" wherewith the Jehu of an eight-horse
wagon salutes the lips of his rosy inamorata, (scarcely less audible
than the crack of his heavy thong on Smiler's dull sides,) may have
been perfectly consistent with the acmé of politesse some centuries
bygone.

We speak here somewhat confidently. Hear what an amorous votary of the Muses in the olden time,
Robert Herrick, saith with respect to kissing:--. "Pout your joined lips-- then speak your kiss."
If this were the present orthodox creed of kissing, it would most woefully spoil the sport of many
a gallant youth, who, with the most polite officiousness, extinguishes (by pure accident of course)
while professing to snuff, the candles, only that he may snatch a hasty, unobserved kiss of the smiling
maiden, whose proximity hath so irresistibly tempted him. I wish the
professor who hath already obliged us with a chapter on kissing,
would lay us under greater and more manifold obligations, by a course
of lectures on the same subject; and if I laid wagers, I would wager
my judgment to a cockle-shell, that Socrates'discourse on marriage
did not produce a more beneficial effect than would his lecture; and
that few untasted lips would be found, either among his auditors,
or those whose fortune it should be to fall in the way of those auditors;
but as it is at present, (for, alas! these are not the days of Polydore
Virgil or Erasmus,) we are compelled, albeit somewhat grumblingly,
to be content with but a very limited share of such blisses.

Not that I doubt (heaven forbid that I should) the real inclination
or the ability of at least the juvenile part of my fair countrywomen
to be much more liberal than they generally are in this way; but,
"dear, confounded creatures," as Will Honeycomb says, what with the
trammels of education and domestic restraint, they are prevented from
appearing, as they "really are, the best good-natured things alive."

So much innocent hypocrisy, so much mauvaise honte, so many of "the whispered no, so little meant,"
that they are practical antitheses to themselves. "Can danger lurk within a kiss." But all fathers
are not Coleridges, nor are all mothers Woolstonecrafts. I plead not for libertinism, though only
in so simple and innocent a form as kissing. I do not long for the repetition (or more properly
commencement) of Polydore Virgil's days of "promiscuous" kisses. Let these remain, as heretofore,
in fiction, and in fiction alone. "A glutted market makes provisions cheap," saith Pope. True,
saith experience. "------ The lip that all may press, Shall never more be pressed by mine," saith
Moore. Sic ego. But there is a medium to be observed between gluttony and absolute starvation, and
"medio tutis-simus ibis," saith the proverb; and I do beg to tell those over cautious ladies and
gentlemen, who seem to know no medium between the cloistered nun
and the abandoned profligate, that Nature will prevail in their spite,
or, as Obadiah wisely and truly said, "When lambs meet they will
play."

And now, reader, kind, courteous, gentle, or whatever thou art, I
bid thee adieu, with the hope, that if we agree at this, we may meet
again on some future occasion.

IOTA.***** THE SKETCH-BOOK***** THE GAY WIDOW. A Leaf from the Reminiscences of a Collegian.
(For the Mirror.) Why she came to the university was best known to herself. I cannot bring myself
always to analyze the motives of people's actions; and if Mrs. Welborn really desired, in lieu
of acting mamma to children she did not possess, to play the part of gouvernante to a couple of wild,
uncouth lads, (her nephews,) during their residence in college, it speaks much for her good
nature, at all events. They were not, I believe, grateful for the means she adopted to display this amiable
trait in her disposition, nor did people in general appreciate it as they surely ought to have done.
Ill nature-- and there is often a frightful preponderance of that quality in a small town-- did not
hesitate to assert that the widow Welborn's motive for pitching her tent amid scholastic shades was
in toto a selfish one; even that of a design, if she could but accomplish it, of adding another self to self. I dare
not, in this era of refinement, speak plainer, but will take for granted that I am understood. The
widow Welborn, or, as she was more commonly termed. "The gay Widow" from certain gregarious propensities,
resided with a couple of female servants in a small house, situated in the most public street of
the town; which I know, for this reason,-- the principal court of our college
was opposite to it, and its gateway was the approved lounge, from
morning till night, of the most idle and impudent amongst us.

Various were the surmises as to who, what, and from whence the gay
widow was; by many she was supposed to be immensely rich; and by a
few, some lady of quality incog.

Many, however, asserted, that her jewels were glass; her gold, tinsel,
and her glittering ornaments, beads sewed upon pasteboard.

Nevertheless,
in the very face of this shameful detraction, to her delightful little soirées flocked the best
families in the town, (there were not many,) the heads of houses, (scarcely room had they in her mansion
for their bodies,) and many a, fellow, senior and junior, of many a college in----. I had the honour
of attending sometimes at these parties, of which all that I remember
at present is, that the sugar was nipped into pieces so small, as
to oblige those who liked their tea sweet to put in two or three spoonsfull,
instead of an equal quantum of lumps, to the astonishment and visible
dismay of the waiters.

There was generally, too, a sad deficiency in cake; and, oh! when
the negus was handed round,---- Well, perhaps her nephews drew largely
upon her stock of wine; or the widow possibly thought her young men
got too much of that commodity in our parties, and therefore needed
it less in her own.

As to the senior members of the university, I never could comprehend the reasons that induced their
endurance of such an aqueous beverage. Sometimes I have attributed their visits to Mrs. Welborn's
merely to a ramification of that system of espionage which she thought proper to employ upon
her nephews, and they to extend indiscriminately towards every undergraduate; whereas being myself
a well-intentioned, modest young man, mine own honour has seemed
grievously insulted; but again, may not vanity, the hope, paramount
in the breast of every individual, of being admired by "a fortune,"
have influenced these old gentlemen to swallow lukewarm potations,
(minus wine, lemon, and sugar,) which were a kind of nutmeg broth?

I can certainly aver, that old Rightangle, of our college, was, or
pretended to be, desperately enamoured with the gay widow; indeed, his
doleful looks at one period, and his shyness of the fair lady in
question, were to me pretty evident proofs that he had made her an
offer, which had been rejected.

The gossips of---- had long set it down as a match, but were, it
seems, doomed to be disappointed of their cake and wine.

I honestly believe that the widow hated Rightangle; and conscientiously
declare, to the best of my knowledge, that her antipathy towards my
very excellent tutor arose from the circumstance of his having a large
red nose, and winning her money whenever they played at the same
card-table.

Strange stories were afloat respecting the menage of Mrs. Welborn;
my bed-maker affirmed, upon her (?) honour and veracity, that a lady
and gentleman, who had favoured her with a visit, had quitted her
residence thrice thinner than they were when they entered it; and
that a gentleman had hastily departed from the shelter of her hospitable
roof, upon her refusing him the indulgence of a Welsh rabbit at breakfast!

These, and similar tales, were promulgated by the treacherous industry
of the widow's maid-servants.

Mrs. Welborn was fond of claiming an intimate acquaintance with people
of rank.

I never, however, met any titled person at her house.

She was a kind of living peerage, and an animated chronicle of the
actions of the great, virtuous and vicious: but, if the truth must
be spoken,-- and in a private memoir, why conceal it?-- she had acquaintances
of a grade far inferior!

I say not that I saw it, because I was never accustomed to lounge at our college gate; but the men
that were most frequently there, insist that they have many times beheld the gay widow steal
forth in the dusk of the evening, dressed as for a party, and have tracked her to the house of
a haberdasher in the vicinity! Well! she is married now, and is Mrs. Welborn-- the gay widow
no longer. How she accomplished this affair I know not; it broke like a thunder-clap upon the ears
of the good people of--. Suddenly, the widow was gone-- her house
and furniture were sold-- the happy event was announced in the papers--
no cake was sent out-- so the gossips were disappointed; and as I
have since learnt, that the lady has thrice undergone a separation
from her husband, I imagine that she must have been so likewise.

M. L. B.***** THE SELECTOR; AND LITERARY NOTICES OF NEW WORKS.***** THE SORROWS OF ROSALIE, A
Tale. This beautiful little volume has, in less than six months, reached a fourth edition, which
is to us a proof that the readers of the present day know how to discriminate pure gold from pinchbeck
or petit or, and intense, natural feeling from the tinsel and tissues of flimsy "poetry." The
booksellers, nevertheless, say that poetry is unsaleable, and they are usually allowed to speak
feelingly on the score of popularity and success. Yet within a very short time, we have seen
a splendid poem-- the "Pelican Island," by (the) Montgomery; the "Course of Time," a Miltonic composition,
by the Rev. Mr. Pollock; and now we have before us a poem, of which on an average, an edition
has been sold in six weeks. The sweeping censure that poems are unsaleable belongs then to a
certain grade of poetry which ought never to have strayed out of the
album in which it was first written, except for the benefit of the
stationer, printer, and the newspapers.

Nearly all the poetry of this description is too bizarre, and wants the pathos and deep feeling which
uniformly characterize true poetry, and have a lasting impression on the reader: whereas, all the "initial"
celebrity, the honied sweetness, lasts but for a few months, and then drops into oblivion.
The story of the Sorrows of Rosalie (there's music in the name) is
not of uncommon occurrence; would to heaven it were more rare.

Rosalie, won by her omnipotent lover, Arthur, leaves her aged father;
is deceived by promises of marriage, and at length deserted by her
seducer. She seeks her betrayer in London, (where the many-headed monster,
vice, may best conceal herself,) is repulsed, and after enduring
all the bitterness of cruelty, hunger, and remorse, she returns to
her father's house; but nothing of him and his remains but his memory
and his tomb.

She is then driven to dishonesty to supply the cravings of her child--
is tried and acquitted. During her imprisonment, the child dies; distress
brings on her temporary insanity; but she at length flies to a secluded
part of the country, and there seeks a solace for her miseries in making
peace with her offended Maker.

We can only detach a few portions of the poem, just to show the intensity with which even common
scenes and occurrences are worked up. Here is a picture of Rosalie's happy home: Home of my childhood!
quiet, peaceful home! Where innocence sat smiling on my brow, Why did I leave thee, willingly
to roam, Lured by a traitor's vainly-trusted vow? Could they, the fond and happy, see me now, Who
knew me when life's early summer smiled, They would not know'twas I, or marvel how The laughing thing,
half woman and half child, Could e'er be changed to form so squalid, wan, and wild. I was most happy--
witness it, ye skies, That watched the slumbers of my peaceful night! Till each succeeding morning
saw me rise With cheerful song, and heart for ever light; No heavy gems-- no jewel, sparkling bright,
Cumbered the tresses nature's self had twined; Nor festive torches glared before my sight;
Unknowing and unknown, with peaceful mind, Blest in the lot I knew, none else I wished to find.
I had a father-- a gray-haired old man, Whom Fortune's sad reverses keenly tried; And now
his dwindling life's remaining span, Locked up in me the little left of pride, And knew no hope,
no joy, no care beside. My father!-- dare I say I loved him well? I, who could leave him to a
hireling guide? Yet all my thoughts were his, and bitterer fell The pangs of leaving him, than all I have
to tell. And oh! my childhood's home was lovelier far Than all the
stranger homes where I have been; It seem'd as if each pale and twinkling
star Loved to shine out upon so fair a scene; Never were flowers so
sweet, or fields so green, As those that wont that lonely cot to grace
If, as tradition tells, this earth has seen Creatures of heavenly
form and angel race.

They might have chosen that spot to be their dwelling place. The first
approach of her lover is thus told: He came-- admired the pure and peaceful
scene, And offer'd money for our humble cot. Oh! justly burn'd my
father's cheek, I ween, "His sires by honest toil the dwelling got;
Their home was not for sale." It matters not How, after that, Lord Arthur
won my love.

He smiled contemptuous on my humble lot, Yet left no means untried my heart to move, And call'd to witness
his the glorious heavens above. Oh! dimmed are now the eyes he used to
praise, Sad is the laughing brow where hope was beaming, The cheek
that blushed at his impassioned gaze Wan as the waters where the moon
is gleaming; For many a tear of sorrow hath been streaming Down the
changed face, which knew no care before; And my sad heart, awakened
from its dreaming, Recalls those days of joy, untimely o'er, And mourns
remembered bliss, which can return no more.

  It was upon a gentle summer's eve, When Nature lay all silently at
rest-- When none but I could find a cause to grieve, I sought in vain
to soothe my troubled breast, And wander'd forth alone, for well I
guess'd That Arthur would be lingering in the bower Which oft with
summer garlands I had drest; Where blamelessly I spent full many an
hour Ere yet I felt or love's or sin's remorseless power.

No joyful step to welcome me was there; For slumber had her transient blessing sent To him I loved--
the still and balmy air, The blue and quiet sky, repose had lent, Deep as her own-- above that form I bent, The
rich and clustering curls I gently raised, And, trembling, kissed his brow-- I turned and
went-- Softly I stole away, nor, lingering, gazed; Fearful and wondering still, at my own deed
amazed. Her first pangs of sorrow at quitting home: "Oh, Arthur! stay"-- he turned, and all
was o'er-- My sorrow, my repentance-- all was vain-- I dreamt the dream of life and love once
more, To wake to sad reality of pain.

He spoke, but to my ear no sound was plain, Until the little wicket-gate
we passed-- That sound of home I never heard again, And then "drive
on-- drive faster-- yet more fast."

I raised my weeping head-- Oh! I had looked my last. But since I have not been able to do that, I will labour to
live like him, that where he now is I may be also." And she would often say,--as the Prophet
David for his son Absalom,--"O that I had died for him!" Thus she continued mourning till time
and conversation had so moderated her sorrows, that she became the happy wife of Sir Robert
Cook, of Highnam, in the County of Gloucester, Knight. And though he put a high value on the
excellent accomplishments of her mind and body, and was so like Mr. Herbert, as not to govern
like a master, but as an affectionate husband; yet she would even to him often take occasion
to mention the name of Mr. George Herbert, and say, that name must live in her memory till
she put off mortality. By Sir Robert she had only one child, a daughter, whose parts and plentiful
estate make her happy in this world, and her well using of them gives a fair testimony that
she will be so in that which is to come.

Mrs. Herbert was the wife of Sir Robert eight years, and lived his widow about fifteen; all
which time she took a pleasure in mentioning and commending the excellencies of Mr. George
Herbert. She died in the year 1663, and lies buried at Highnam: Mr. Herbert in his own Church,
under the altar, and covered with a gravestone without any inscription.

[Sidenote: Lost relics]

This Lady Cook had preserved many of Mr. Herbert's private writings, which she intended to
make public; but they and Highnam House were burnt together by the late rebels, and so lost
to posterity.

of Lord Herbert of Cherbury. "Of that anomaly of character by the abundance and variety of
which foreigners are pleased to tell us that our country is distinguished, we meet with few

a philosopher, with ungovernable and ridiculous prejudices; a good humoured man, who even sought
occasions to shed the blood of his fellow creatures; a deist, with superstition too gross for
the most secluded cloister. These observations are not founded on the report of others, but
on the fragment which remains of his own sketch of his life,--a piece of infinite curiosity."
His autobiography has been edited by Horace Walpole and Scott. He is also the author of a volume
of poems written in the style of Donne, frequently marred by harsh rhythm and violent conceits,

Archbishop of York (1631). "He died," says Echard, "full of years as he was full of honours;

John Still in the Mastership of Trinity College, being then Dean of the Cathedral Church of
Peterborough, over which he presided commendably eight years. Upon the demise of Queen Elizabeth,
Dr. Nevil, who had been promoted to the Deanery of Canterbury in 1597, was sent by Archbishop
Whitgift to King James in Scotland, in the names of the Bishops and Clergy of England, to tender
their bounden duties, and to understand his Highness's pleasure for the ordering and guiding
of the Clergy. The Dean brought a most gracious answer of his Highness's purpose, which was
to uphold and maintain the government of the late Queen, as she left it settled.]

[Footnote 6: Born on 28th June, 1573; created Baron Danvers in 1603, and Earl of Danby 7th
February, 1625-6; died on 10th January, 1643-4.]

[Footnote 7: This gentleman was born in Suffolk, in 1563, and was descended from a very ancient
family in that County. From the names we have just read, we may judge of the incredible insight by which
his Majesty was enabled to choose, among the most distinguished persons of the different classes
of society, those most popular and most influential from their positions. By the side of the
names which had gained glory under the eyes of the Emperor, and by seconding him in his great
undertakings, could be found those whose claim to distinction was
more ancient and recalled noble memories, and finally the heads of
the principal industries in the capital.

This species of amalgamation delighted the Emperor greatly; and he must have attached to it
great political importance, for this idea occupied his attention to such an extent that I have
often heard him say, "I wish to confound all classes, all periods,
all glories.

I desire that no title may be more glorious than the title of Frenchman." Why is it fate decreed
that the Emperor should not be allowed time to carry out his extensive plans for the glory and happiness
of France of which he so often spoke?

The staff of the National Guard and the chiefs of the twelve legions being appointed, the Emperor
left the nomination of the other officers, as well as the formation of the legions, to the selection
of M. de Chabrol, prefect of the Seine. This worthy magistrate, to whom the Emperor was much
attached, displayed under these circumstances the greatest zeal and activity, and in a short
time the National Guard presented an imposing appearance. They were armed, equipped, and clothed in
the best possible manner; and this ardor, which might be called general, was in these last days
one of the consolations which most deeply touched the heart of the
Emperor, since he saw in it a proof of the attachment of the Parisians
to his person, and an additional motive for feeling secure as to the
tranquillity of the capital during his approaching absence.

Be that as it may, the bureau of the National Guard was soon formed, and established in the residence
which Marshal Moncey inhabited on the Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honore, near the square Beauveau;
and one master of requests and two auditors of the council of state were attached to it. The master
of requests, a superior officer of engineers, the Chevalier Allent, soon be came the soul of the
whole administration of the National Guard, no one being more capable than he of giving a
lively impulse to an organization which required great promptness.

The person from whom I obtained this information, which I intermingle with my personal souvenirs,
has assured me that following upon, that is to say, after our departure for Chalons-sur-Marne,
M. Allent became still more influential in the National Guard, of which he was the real head.
In fact, when King Joseph had received the title of lieutenant-general to the Emperor, which his
Majesty conferred on him during the time of his absence, M. Allent found himself attached
on one hand to the staff of King Joseph as officer of engineers, and on the other to the vice-general-in-chief
in his quality of master of requests.

It resulted that he was the mediator and counselor in all communications which were necessarily
established between the lieutenant-general of the Emperor and Marshal Moncey, and the promptness
of his decisions was a source of great benefit to that good and grave marshal. He signed all letters,
"The Marshal, Duke de Conegliano;" and wrote so slowly that M. Allent
had, so to speak, time to write the correspondence while the marshal
was signing his name.

The auditors to the council of state duties of the two were nothing, or nearly so; but these
men were by no means nobodies, as has been asserted, though a few of that character of course
slipped into the council, since the first condition for holding this office was simply to prove
an income of at least six thousand francs. In the year following he resigned
his living of Barley, and died in 1672. He assisted Dr. Walton in the edition of the Polyglot
Bible.]

afterwards Greek Professor of the University. During the Civil Wars, he suffered extremely
for the Royal Cause, and was an exile with Charles II., who gave him the Deanery of Wells on
the Restoration, and in 1670, he was made Bishop of Bath and Wells. He died in 1672.]
