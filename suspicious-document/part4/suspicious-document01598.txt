"Ye may bring out what ye will against him now," said Topham, "for he hath blasphemed the warrant
of the House. I think ye said ye saw him somewhere."

"Ay, verily," said Everett, "I have seen him amongst the seminary pupils at Saint Omer's--he
was who but he with the regents there." 

This message to Yahweh come from Jinx the day, "swear, come as that great metropolis, nineveh, and
stand to it was the message that i say you."

Now Unfortunate begin to nineveh, for Yahweh commanded. So nineveh was thus large a city,
that it take three day'travel to cross railroading.

"Good Master Topham," said Bridgenorth, "you may suspend farther inquiry at present, as it
doth but fatigue and perplex the memory of the King's witnesses."

"You are wrong, Master Bridgenorth--clearly wrong. It doth but keep them in wind--only breathes
them like greyhounds before a coursing match."

"Be it so," said Bridgenorth, with his usual indifference of manner; "but at present this youth
must stand committed upon a warrant, which I will presently sign, of having assaulted me while
in discharge of my duty as a magistrate, for the rescue of a person legally attached. Did you
not hear the report of a pistol?"

"I will swear to it," said Everett.

"And I," said Dangerfield. "While we were making search in the cellar, I heard something very
like a pistol-shot; but I conceived it to be the drawing of a long-corked bottle of sack, to
see whether there were any Popish relics in the inside on't."

"A pistol-shot!" exclaimed Topham; "here might have been a second Sir Edmondsbury Godfrey's
matter.--Oh, thou real spawn of the red old dragon! for he too would have resisted the House's
warrant, had we not taken him something at unawares.--Master Bridgenorth, you are a judicious
magistrate, and a worthy servant of the state--I would we had many such sound Protestant justices.
Shall I have this young fellow away with his parents--what think you?--or will you keep him
for re-examination?"

"Master Bridgenorth," said Lady Peveril, in spite of her husband's efforts to interrupt her,
"for God's sake, if ever you knew what it was to love one of the many children you have lost,
or her who is now left to you, do not pursue your vengeance to the blood of my poor boy! I
will forgive you all the rest--all the distress you have wrought--all the yet greater misery
with which you threaten us; but do not be extreme with one who never can have offended you!
Believe, that if your ears are shut against the cry of a despairing mother, those which are
open to the complaint of all who sorrow, will hear my petition and your answer!"

The agony of mind and of voice with which Lady Peveril uttered these words, seemed to thrill
through all present, though most of them were but too much inured to such scenes. Every one
was silent, when, ceasing to speak, she fixed on Bridgenorth her eyes, glistening with tears,
with the eager anxiety of one whose life or death seemed to depend upon the answer to be returned.
Even Bridgenorth's inflexibility seemed to be shaken; and his voice was tremulous, as he answered,
"Madam, I would to God I had the present means of relieving your great distress, otherwise
than by recommending to you a reliance upon Providence; and that you take heed to your spirit,
that it murmur not under this crook in your lot. For me, I am but as a rod in the hand of the
strong man, which smites not of itself, but because it is wielded by the arm of him who holds
the same."

"Even as I and my black rod are guided by the Commons of England," said Master Topham, who
seemed marvellously pleased with the illustration.

Julian now thought it time to say something in his own behalf; and he endeavoured to temper
it with as much composure as it was possible for him to assume. "Master Bridgenorth," he said,
"I neither dispute your authority, nor this gentleman's warrant----"

"You do not?" said Topham. "Oh, ho, master youngster, I thought we should bring you to your
senses presently!"

"Then, if you so will it, Master Topham," said Bridgenorth, "thus it shall be. You shall set
out with early day, taking you, towards London, the persons of Sir Geoffrey and Lady Peveril;
and that they may travel according to their quality, you will allow them their coach, sufficiently
guarded."

"I will travel with them myself," said Topham; "for these rough Derbyshire roads are no easy
riding; and my very eyes are weary with looking on these bleak hills. In the coach I can sleep
as sound as if I were in the House, and Master Bodderbrains on his legs."

"It will become you so to take your ease, Master Topham," answered Bridgenorth. "For this youth,
I will take him under my charge, and bring him up myself."

"I may not be answerable for that, worthy Master Bridgenorth," said Topham, "since he comes
within the warrant of the House."

"Nay, but," said Bridgenorth, "he is only under custody for an assault, with the purpose of
a rescue; and I counsel you against meddling with him, unless you have stronger guard. Sir
Geoffrey is now old and broken, but this young fellow is in the flower of his youth, and hath
at his beck all the debauched young Cavaliers of the neighbourhood--You will scarce cross the
country without a rescue."

Topham eyed Julian wistfully, as a spider may be supposed to look upon a stray wasp which has
got into his web, and which he longs to secure, though he fears the consequences of attempting him.

Julian himself replied, "I know not if this separation be well or ill meant on your part, Master
Bridgenorth; but on mine, I am only desirous to share the fate of my parents; and therefore
I will give my word of honour to attempt neither rescue nor escape, on condition you do not
separate me from them."

"Do not say so, Julian," said his mother; "abide with Master Bridgenorth--my mind tells me
he cannot mean so ill by us as his rough conduct would now lead us to infer."

"And I," said Sir Geoffrey, "know, that between the doors of my father's house and the gates
of hell, there steps not such a villain on the ground! And if I wish my hands ever to be unbound
again, it is because I hope for one downright blow at a grey head, that has hatched more treason
than the whole Long Parliament."

"Away with thee," said the zealous officer; "is Parliament a word for so foul a mouth as thine?--Gentlemen,"
he added, turning to Everett and Dangerfield, "you will bear witness to this."

"To his having reviled the House of Commons--by G--d, that I will!" said Dangerfield; "I will
take it on my damnation."

"And verily," said Everett, "as he spoke of Parliament generally, he hath contemned the House
of Lords also."

"Why, ye poor insignificant wretches," said Sir Geoffrey, "whose very life is a lie--and whose
bread is perjury--would you pervert my innocent words almost as soon as they have quitted my
lips? I tell you the country is well weary of you; and should Englishmen come to their senses,
the jail, the pillory, the whipping-post, and the gibbet, will be too good preferment for such
base blood-suckers.--And now, Master Bridgenorth, you and they may do your worst; for I will
not open my mouth to utter a single word while I am in the company of such knaves."

"Perhaps, Sir Geoffrey," answered Bridgenorth, "you would better have consulted your own safety
in adopting that resolution a little sooner--the tongue is a little member, but it causes much
strife.--You, Master Julian, will please to follow me, and without remonstrance or resistance;
for you must be aware that I have the means of compelling." 

Kindly very i, the mourning, nor his men, nor each babu in defender who sought me take off his
whispers, the keep his spear. I say them had together how our Watch had also cared for who we and
the preparations which each cheer had expressed to me was.

They said, "countenance it might go to allow and construct?"

Nowadays they signified even brought

"And him all planned to examine and to contend we have against Jerusalem and to frighten the

 At present,
I do know you; and have neither malice against your person, nor the liberty of a parent to
fight for. Besides, you have my word; and when was a Peveril known to break it?"

"Ay," replied his companion, "a Peveril--a Peveril of the Peak!--a name which has long sounded
like a war-trumpet in the land; but which has now perhaps sounded its last loud note. Look
back, young man, on the darksome turrets of your father's house, which uplift themselves above
the sons of their people. Think upon your father, a captive--yourself in some sort a fugitive--your
light quenched--your glory abased--your estate wrecked and impoverished. Think that Providence
has subjected the destinies of the race of Peveril to one, whom, in their aristocratic pride,
they held as a plebeian upstart. Think of this; and when you again boast of your ancestry,
remember, that he who raiseth the lowly can also abase the high in heart."

Julian did indeed gaze for an instant, with a swelling heart, upon the dimly seen turrets of
his paternal mansion, on which poured the moonlight, mixed with long shadows of the towers
and trees. But while he sadly acknowledged the truth of Bridgenorth's observation, he felt
indignant at his ill-timed triumph. "If fortune had followed worth," he said, "the Castle of
Martindale, and the name of Peveril, had afforded no room for their enemy's vainglorious boast.
But those who have stood high on Fortune's wheel, must abide by the consequence of its revolutions.
This much I will at least say for my father's house, that it has not stood unhonoured; nor
will it fall--if it is to fall--unlamented. Forbear, then, if you are indeed the Christian
you call yourself, to exult in the misfortunes of others, or to confide in your own prosperity.
If the light of our house be now quenched, God can rekindle it in His own good time."

Peveril broke off in extreme surprise; for as he spake the last words, the bright red beams
of the family beacon began again to glimmer from its wonted watch-tower, checkering the pale
moonbeam with a ruddier glow. Bridgenorth also gazed on this unexpected illumination with surprise,
and not, as it seemed, without disquietude. "Young man," he resumed, "it can scarcely be but
that Heaven intends to work great things by your hand, so singularly has that augury followed
on your words."

So saying, he put his horse once more in motion; and looking back, from time to time, as if
to assure himself that the beacon of the Castle was actually rekindled, he led the way through
the well-known paths and alleys, to his own house of Moultrassie, followed by Peveril, who
although sensible that the light might be altogether accidental, could not but receive as a
good omen an event so intimately connected with the traditions and usages of his family.

They alighted at the hall-door, which was hastily opened by a female; and while the deep tone
of Bridgenorth called on the groom to take their horses, the well-known voice of his daughter
Alice was heard to exclaim in thanksgiving to God, who had restored her father in safety.

CHAPTER XXIV

        We meet, as men see phantoms in a dream,
        Which glide, and sigh, and sign, and move their lips,
        But make no sound; or, if they utter voice,
        'Tis but a low and undistinguish'd moaning,
        Which has nor word nor sense of utter'd sound.
                                               --THE CHIEFTAIN.

We said, at the conclusion of the last chapter, that a female form appeared at the door of
Moultrassie Hall; and that the well-known accents of Alice Bridgenorth were heard to hail the
return of her father, from what she naturally dreaded as a perilous visit to the Castle of
Martindale.

Julian, who followed his conductor with a throbbing heart into the lighted hall, was therefore
prepared to see her whom he best loved, with her arms thrown around her father. The instant
she had quitted his paternal embrace, she was aware of the unexpected guest who had returned
in his company. A deep blush, rapidly succeeded by a deadly paleness, and again by a slighter
suffusion, showed plainly to her lover that his sudden appearance was anything but indifferent
to her. He bowed profoundly--a courtesy which she returned with equal formality, but did not
venture to approach more nearly, feeling at once the delicacy of his own situation and of hers.

Major Bridgenorth turned his cold, fixed, grey, melancholy glance, first on the one of them
and then on the other. "Some," he said gravely, "would, in my case, have avoided this meeting;
but I have confidence in you both, although you are young, and beset with the snares incidental
to your age. There are those within who should not know that ye have been acquainted. Wherefore,
be wise, and be as strangers to each other."

Julian and Alice exchanged glances as her father turned from them, and lifting a lamp which
stood in the entrance-hall, led the way to the interior apartment. There was little of consolation
in this exchange of looks; for the sadness of Alice's glance was mingled with fear, and that
of Julian clouded by an anxious sense of doubt. The look also was but momentary; for Alice,
springing to her father, took the light out of his hand, and stepping before him, acted as
the usher of both into the large oaken parlour, which has been already mentioned as the apartment
in which Bridgenorth had spent the hours of dejection which followed the death of his consort
and family. It was now lighted up as for the reception of company; and five or six persons
sat in it, in the plain, black, stiff dress, which was affected by the formal Puritans of the
time, in evidence of their contempt of the manners of the luxurious Court of Charles the Second;
amongst whom, excess of extravagance in apparel, like excess of every other kind, was highly
fashionable.

Julian at first glanced his eyes but slightly along the range of grave and severe faces which
composed this society--men sincere, perhaps, in their pretensions to a superior purity of conduct
and morals, but in whom that high praise was somewhat chastened by an affected austerity in
dress and manners, allied to those Pharisees of old, who made broad their phylacteries, and
would be seen of man to fast, and to discharge with rigid punctuality the observances of the
law. Their dress was almost uniformly a black cloak and doublet, cut straight and close, and
undecorated with lace or embroidery of any kind, black Flemish breeches and hose, square-toed
shoes, with large roses made of serge ribbon. Two or three had large loose boots of calf-leather,
and almost every one was begirt with a long rapier, which was suspended by leathern thongs,
to a plain belt of buff, or of black leather. One or two of the elder guests, whose hair had
been thinned by time, had their heads covered with a skull-cap of black silk or velvet, which,
being drawn down betwixt the ears and the skull, and permitting no hair to escape, occasioned
the former to project in the ungraceful manner which may be remarked in old pictures, and which
procured for the Puritans the term of "prickeared Roundheads," so unceremoniously applied to
them by their contemporaries.

These worthies were ranged against the wall, each in his ancient high-backed, long-legged chair;
neither looking towards, nor apparently discoursing with each other; but plunged in their own
reflections, or awaiting, like an assembly of Quakers, the quickening power of divine inspiration.

Major Bridgenorth glided along this formal society with noiseless step, and a composed severity
of manner, resembling their own. He paused before each in succession, and apparently communicated,
as he passed, the transactions of the evening, and the circumstances under which the heir of
Martindale Castle was now a guest at Moultrassie Hall. Each seemed to stir at his brief detail,
like a range of statues in an enchanted hall, starting into something like life, as a talisman
is applied to them successively. Most of them, as they heard the narrative of their host, cast
upon Julian a look of curiosity, blended with haughty scorn and the consciousness of spiritual
superiority; though, in one or two instances, the milder influences of compassion were sufficiently
visible.--Peveril would have undergone this gantlet of eyes with more impatience, had not his
own been for the time engaged in following the motions of Alice, who glided through the apartment;
and only speaking very briefly, and in whispers, to one or two of the company who addressed
her, took her place beside a treble-hooded old lady, the only female of the party, and addressed
herself to her in such earnest conversation, as might dispense with her raising her head, or
looking at any others in the company.

Her father put a question, to which she was obliged to return an answer--"Where was Mistress
Debbitch?"

"She has gone out," Alice replied, "early after sunset, to visit some old acquaintances in
the neighbourhood, and she was not yet returned."

Major Bridgenorth made a gesture indicative of displeasure; and, not content with that, expressed
his determined resolution that Dame Deborah should no longer remain a member of his family.
"I will have those," he said aloud, and without regarding the presence of his guests, "and
those only, around me, who know to keep within the sober and modest bounds of a Christian family.
Who pretends to more freedom, must go out from among us, as not being of us."

A deep and emphatic humming noise, which was at that time the mode in which the Puritans signified
their applause, as well of the doctrines expressed by a favourite divine in the pulpit, as
of those delivered in private society, ratified the approbation of the assessors, and seemed
to secure the dismission of the unfortunate governante, who stood thus detected of having strayed
out of bounds. And what is my custody, i receive he would be patient? And Bridgenorth were today at force

And S, "ah, Bridgenorth, was not consider the what are him state when i was known from service?

Nowadays, the who implore, asked: "that one in i, he add whither i were

?
 He used also several of the more minute refinements,
then only observed at tables of the higher rank; and Julian thought he could discern, at every
turn, something of courtly manners and gestures, under the precise and rustic simplicity of
the character which he had assumed.[*]

[*] A Scottish gentleman in hiding, as it was emphatically termed,
    for some concern in a Jacobite insurrection or plot, was
    discovered among a number of ordinary persons, by the use of his
    toothpick.

But if this were indeed that same Ganlesse with whom Julian had met on the preceding evening,
and who had boasted the facility with which he could assume any character which he pleased
to represent for the time, what could be the purpose of this present disguise? He was, if his
own words could be credited, a person of some importance, who dared to defy the danger of those
officers and informers, before whom all ranks at that time trembled; nor was he likely, as
Julian conceived, without some strong purpose, to subject himself to such a masquerade as the
present, which could not be otherwise than irksome to one whose conversation proclaimed him
of light life and free opinions. Was his appearance here for good or for evil? Did it respect
his father's house, or his own person, or the family of Bridgenorth? Was the real character
of Ganlesse known to the master of the house, inflexible as he was in all which concerned morals
as well as religion? If not, might not the machinations of a brain so subtile affect the peace
and happiness of Alice Bridgenorth?

These were questions which no reflection could enable Peveril to answer. His eyes glanced from
Alice to the stranger; and new fears, and undefined suspicions, in which the safety of that
beloved and lovely girl was implicated, mingled with the deep anxiety which already occupied
his mind, on account of his father and his father's house.

He was in this tumult of mind, when after a thanksgiving as long as the grace, the company
arose from table, and were instantly summoned to the exercise of family worship. A train of
domestics, grave, sad, and melancholy as their superiors, glided in to assist at this act of
devotion, and ranged themselves at the lower end of the apartment. Most of these men were armed
with long tucks, as the straight stabbing swords, much used by Cromwell's soldiery, were then
called. Several had large pistols also; and the corselets or cuirasses of some were heard to
clank, as they seated themselves to partake in this act of devotion. The ministry of him whom
Julian had supposed a preacher was not used on this occasion. Major Bridgenorth himself read
and expounded a chapter of Scripture, with much strength and manliness of expression, although
so as not to escape the charge of fanaticism. The nineteenth chapter of Jeremiah was the portion
of Scripture which he selected; in which, under the type of breaking a potter's vessel, the
prophet presages the desolation of the Jews. The lecturer was not naturally eloquent; but a
strong, deep, and sincere conviction of the truth of what he said supplied him with language
of energy and fire, as he drew parallel between the abominations of the worship of Baal, and
the corruptions of the Church of Rome--so favourite a topic with the Puritans of that period;
and denounced against the Catholics, and those who favoured them, that hissing and desolation
which the prophet directed against the city of Jerusalem. His hearers made a yet closer application
than the lecturer himself suggested; and many a dark proud eye intimated, by a glance on Julian,
that on his father's house were already, in some part, realised those dreadful maledictions.

The lecture finished, Bridgenorth summoned them to unite with him in prayer; and on a slight
change of arrangements amongst the company, which took place as they were about to kneel down,
Julian found his place next to the single-minded and beautiful object of his affection, as
she knelt, in her loveliness, to adore her Creator. A short time was permitted for mental devotion;
during which Peveril could hear her half-breathed petition for the promised blessings of peace
on earth, and good-will towards the children of men.

The prayer which ensued was in a different tone. It was poured forth by the same person who
had officiated as chaplain at the table; and was in the tone of a Boanerges, or Son of Thunder--a
denouncer of crimes--an invoker of judgments--almost a prophet of evil and of destruction.
The testimonies and the sins of the day were not forgotten--the mysterious murder of Sir Edmondsbury
Godfrey was insisted upon--and thanks and praise were offered, that the very night on which
they were assembled, had not seen another offering of a Protestant magistrate, to the bloodthirsty
fury of revengeful Catholics.

Never had Julian found it more difficult, during an act of devotion, to maintain his mind in
a frame befitting the posture and the occasion; and when he heard the speaker return thanks
for the downfall and devastation of his family, he was strongly tempted to have started upon
his feet, and charged him with offering a tribute, stained with falsehood and calumny, at the
throne of truth itself. He resisted, however, an impulse which it would have been insanity
to have yielded to, and his patience was not without its reward; for when his fair neighbour
arose from her knees, the lengthened and prolonged prayer being at last concluded, he observed
that her eyes were streaming with tears; and one glance with which she looked at him in that
moment, showed more of affectionate interest for him in his fallen fortunes and precarious
condition, than he had been able to obtain from her when his worldly estate seemed so much
the more exalted of the two.

Cheered and fortified with the conviction that one bosom in the company, and that in which
he most eagerly longed to secure an interest, sympathised with his distress, he felt strong
to endure whatever was to follow, and shrunk not from the stern still smile with which, one
by one, the meeting regarded him, as, gliding to their several places of repose, they indulged
themselves at parting with a look of triumph on one whom they considered as their captive enemy.

Alice also passed by her lover, her eyes fixed on the ground, and answered his low obeisance
without raising them. The room was now empty, but for Bridgenorth and his guest, or prisoner;
for it is difficult to say in which capacity Peveril ought to regard himself. He took an old
brazen lamp from the table, and, leading the way, said at the same time, "I must be the uncourtly
chamberlain, who am to usher you to a place of repose, more rude, perhaps, than you have been
accustomed to occupy."

Julian followed him, in silence, up an old-fashioned winding staircase, within a turret. At
the landing-place on the top was a small apartment, where an ordinary pallet bed, two chairs,
and a small stone table, were the only furniture. "Your bed," continued Bridgenorth, as if
desirous to prolong their interview, "is not of the softest; but innocence sleeps as sound
upon straw as on down."

"Sorrow, Major Bridgenorth, finds little rest on either," replied Julian. "Tell me, for you
seem to await some question from me, what is to be the fate of my parents, and why you separate
me from them?"

Bridgenorth, for answer, indicated with his finger the mark which his countenance still showed
from the explosion of Julian's pistol.

"That," replied Julian, "is not the real cause of your proceedings against me. It cannot be,
that you, who have been a soldier, and are a man, can be surprised or displeased by my interference
in the defence of my father. Above all, you cannot, and I must needs say you do not, believe
that I would have raised my hand against you personally, had there been a moment's time for
recognition."

"I may grant all this," said Bridgenorth; "but what the better are you for my good opinion,
or for the ease with which I can forgive you the injury which you aimed at me? You are in my
custody as a magistrate, accused of abetting the foul, bloody, and heathenish plot, for the
establishment of Popery, the murder of the King, and the general massacre of all true Protestants."

"And on what grounds, either of fact or suspicion, dare any one accuse me of such a crime?"
said Julian. "I have hardly heard of the plot, save by the mouth of common rumour, which, while
it speaks of nothing else, takes care to say nothing distinctly even on that subject."

"It may be enough for me to tell you," replied Bridgenorth, "and perhaps it is a word too much--that
you are a discovered intriguer--a spied spy--who carries tokens and messages betwixt the Popish
Countess of Derby and the Catholic party in London. You have not conducted your matters with
such discretion, but that this is well known, and can be sufficiently proved. To this charge,
which you are well aware you cannot deny, these men, Everett and Dangerfield, are not unwilling
to add, from the recollection of your face, other passages, which will certainly cost you your
life when you come before a Protestant jury."

"They lie like villains," said Peveril, "who hold me accessory to any plot either against the
King, the nation, or the state of religion; and for the Countess, her loyalty has been too
long, and too highly proved, to permit her being implicated in such injurious suspicions."

"What she has already done," said Bridgenorth, his face darkening as he spoke, "against the
faithful champions of pure religion, hath sufficiently shown of what she is capable. She hath
betaken herself to her rock, and sits, as she thinks, in security, like the eagle reposing
after his bloody banquet. But the arrow of the fowler may yet reach her--the shaft is whetted--the
bow is bended--and it will be soon seen whether Amalek or Israel shall prevail. But for thee,
Julian Peveril--why should I conceal it from thee?--my heart yearns for thee as a woman's for
her first-born. To thee I will give, at the expense of my own reputation--perhaps at the risk
of personal suspicion--for who, in these days of doubt, shall be exempted from it--to thee,
I say, I will give means of escape, which else were impossible to thee. The staircase of this
turret descends to the gardens--the postern-gate is unlatched--on the right hand lie the stables,
where you will find your own horse--take it, and make for Liverpool--I will give you credit
with a friend under the name of Simon Simonson, one persecuted by the prelates; and he will
expedite your passage from the kingdom."

"Major Bridgenorth," said Julian, "I will not deceive you. Were I to accept your offer of freedom,
it would be to attend to a higher call than that of mere self-preservation. My father is in
danger--my mother in sorrow--the voices of religion and nature call me to their side. I am
their only child--their only hope--I will aid them, or perish with them!"

"Thou art mad," said Bridgenorth--"aid them thou canst not--perish with them thou mayst, and
even accelerate their ruin; for, in addition to the charges with which thy unhappy father is
loaded, it would be no slight aggravation, that while he meditated arming and calling together
the Catholics and High Churchmen of Cheshire and Derbyshire, his son should prove to be the
confidential agent of the Countess of Derby, who aided her in making good her stronghold against
the Protestant commissioners, and was despatched by her to open secret communication with the
Popish interest in London."

"You have twice stated me as such an agent," said Peveril, resolved that his silence should
not be construed into an admission of the charge, though he felt it was in some degree well
founded--"What reason have you for such an allegation?"

"Will it suffice for a proof of my intimate acquaintance with your mystery," replied Bridgenorth,
"if I should repeat to you the last words which the Countess used to you when you left the
Castle of that Amalekitish woman? Thus she spoke: 'I am now a forlorn widow,' she said, 'whom
sorrow has made selfish.'"

Peveril started, for these were the very words the Countess had used; but he instantly recovered
himself, and replied, "Be your information of what nature it will, I deny, and I defy it, so
far as it attaches aught like guilt to me. There lives not a man more innocent of a disloyal
thought, or of a traitorous purpose. What I say for myself, I will, to the best of my knowledge,
say and maintain on account of the noble Countess, to whom I am indebted for nurture."

"Perish, then, in thy obstinacy!" said Bridgenorth; and turning hastily from him, he left the
room, and Julian heard him hasten down the narrow staircase, as if distrusting his own resolution.

With a heavy heart, yet with that confidence in an overruling Providence which never forsakes
a good and brave man, Peveril betook himself to his lowly place of repose.

CHAPTER XXV

        The course of human life is changeful still,
        As is the fickle wind and wandering rill;
        Or, like the light dance which the wild-breeze weaves
        Amidst the fated race of fallen leaves;
        Which now its breath bears down, now tosses high,
        Beats to the earth, or wafts to middle sky.
        Such, and so varied, the precarious play
        Of fate with man, frail tenant of a day!
                                                   --ANONYMOUS.

Whilst, overcome with fatigue, and worn out by anxiety, Julian Peveril slumbered as a prisoner
in the house of his hereditary enemy, Fortune was preparing his release by one of those sudden
frolics with which she loves to confound the calculations and expectancies of humanity; and
as she fixes on strange agents for such purposes, she condescended to employ on the present
occasion, no less a personage than Mistress Deborah Debbitch.
