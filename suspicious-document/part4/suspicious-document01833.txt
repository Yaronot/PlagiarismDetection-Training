First, Gandercleugh is, as it were, the central part--the navel (si fas sit dicere) of this
our native realm of Scotland; so that men, from every corner thereof, when travelling on their
concernments of business, either towards our metropolis of law, by which I mean Edinburgh,
or towards our metropolis and mart of gain, whereby I insinuate Glasgow, are frequently led
to make Gandercleugh their abiding stage and place of rest for the night. And it must be acknowledged
by the most sceptical, that I, who have sat in the leathern armchair, on the left-hand side
of the fire, in the common room of the Wallace Inn, winter and summer, for every evening in
my life, during forty years bypast, (the Christian Sabbaths only excepted,) must have seen
more of the manners and customs of various tribes and people, than if I had sought them out
by my own painful travel and bodily labour. Even so doth the tollman at the well-frequented
turnpike on the Wellbrae-head, sitting at his ease in his own dwelling, gather more receipt
of custom, than if, moving forth upon the road, he were to require a contribution from each
person whom he chanced to meet in his journey, when, according to the vulgar adage, he might
possibly be greeted with more kicks than halfpence.

But, secondly, supposing it again urged, that Ithacus, the most wise of the Greeks, acquired
his renown, as the Roman poet hath assured us, by visiting states and men, I reply to the Zoilus
who shall adhere to this objection,  that, de facto, I have seen states and men also; for I
have visited the famous cities of Edinburgh and Glasgow, the former twice, and the latter three
times, in the course of my earthly pilgrimage. And, moreover, I had the honour to sit in the
General Assembly (meaning, as an auditor, in the galleries thereof,) and have heard as much
goodly speaking on the law of patronage, as, with the fructification thereof in mine own understanding,
hath made me be considered as an oracle upon that doctrine ever since my safe and happy return
to Gandercleugh.

Again,--and thirdly, If it be nevertheless pretended that my information and knowledge of mankind,
however extensive, and however painfully acquired, by constant domestic enquiry, and by foreign
travel, is, natheless, incompetent to the task of recording the pleasant narratives of my Landlord,
I will let these critics know, to their own eternal shame and confusion, as well as to the
abashment and discomfiture of all who shall rashly take up a song against me, that I am NOT
the writer, redacter, or compiler, of the "Tales of my Landlord;" nor am I, in one single iota,
answerable for their contents, more or less. And now, ye generation of critics, who raise yourselves
up as if it were brazen serpents, to hiss with your tongues, and to smite with your stings,
bow yourselves down to your native dust, and acknowledge that yours have been the thoughts
of ignorance, and the words of vain foolishness. Lo! ye are caught in your own snare, and your
own pit hath yawned for you. Turn, then, aside from the task that is too heavy for you; destroy
not your teeth by gnawing a file; waste not your strength by spurning against a castle wall;
nor spend your breath in contending in swiftness with a fleet steed; and let those weigh the
"Tales of my Landlord," who shall bring with them the scales of candour cleansed from the rust
of prejudice by the hands of intelligent modesty. For these alone they were compiled, as will
appear from a brief narrative which my zeal for truth compelled me to make supplementary to
the present Proem.

It is well known that my Landlord was a pleasing and a facetious man, acceptable unto all the
parish of Gandercleugh, excepting only the Laird, the Exciseman, and those for whom he refused
to draw liquor upon trust. Their causes of dislike I will touch separately, adding my own refutation
thereof.

His honour, the Laird, accused our Landlord, deceased, of having encouraged, in various times
and places, the destruction of hares, rabbits, fowls black and grey, partridges, moor-pouts,
roe-deer, and other birds and quadrupeds, at unlawful seasons, and contrary to the laws of
this realm, which have secured, in their wisdom, the slaughter of such animals for the great
of the earth, whom I have remarked to take an uncommon (though to me, an unintelligible) pleasure
therein. Now, in humble deference to his honour, and in justifiable defence of my friend deceased,
I reply to this charge, that howsoever the form of such animals might appear to be similar
to those so protected by the law, yet it was a mere deceptio visus; for what resembled hares
were, in fact, hill-kids, and those partaking of the appearance of moor-fowl, were truly wood
pigeons, and consumed and eaten eo nomine, and not otherwise. Again, the Exciseman pretended,
that my deceased Landlord did encourage that species of manufacture called distillation, without
having an especial permission from the Great, technically called a license, for doing so. Now,
I stand up to confront this falsehood; and in defiance of him, his gauging-stick, and pen and
inkhorn, I tell him, that I never saw, or tasted, a glass of unlawful aqua vitae in the house
of my Landlord; nay, that, on the contrary, we needed not such devices, in respect of a pleasing
and somewhat seductive liquor, which was vended and consumed at the Wallace Inn, under the
name of mountain dew. If there is a penalty against manufacturing such a liquor, let him show
me the statute; and when he does, I'll tell him if I will obey it or no. Concerning those who
came to my Landlord for liquor, and went thirsty away, for lack of present coin, or future
credit, I cannot but say it has grieved my bowels as if the case had been mine own. Nevertheless,
my Landlord considered the necessities of a thirsty soul, and would permit them, in extreme
need, and when their soul was impoverished for lack of moisture, to drink to the full value
of their watches and wearing apparel, exclusively of their inferior habiliments, which he was
uniformly inexorable in obliging them to retain, for the credit of the house. As to mine own
part, I may well say, that he never refused me that modicum of refreshment with which I am
wont to recruit nature after the fatigues of my school. It is true, I taught his five sons
English and Latin, writing, book-keeping, with a tincture of mathematics, and that I instructed
his daughter in psalmody. Nor do I remember me of any fee or honorarium received from him on
account of these my labours, except the compotations aforesaid. Nevertheless this compensation
suited my humour well, since it is a hard sentence to bid a dry throat wait till quarter-day.

But, truly, were I to speak my simple conceit and belief, I think my Landlord was chiefly moved
to waive in my behalf the usual requisition of a symbol, or reckoning, from the pleasure he
was wont to take in my conversation, which, though solid and edifying in the main, was, like
a well-built palace, decorated with facetious narratives and devices, tending much to the enhancement
and ornament thereof. And so pleased was my Landlord of the Wallace in his replies during such
colloquies, that there was no district in Scotland, yea, and no peculiar, and, as it were,
distinctive custom therein practised, but was discussed betwixt us; insomuch, that those who
stood by were wont to say, it was worth a bottle of ale to hear us communicate with each other.
And not a few travellers, from distant parts, as well as from the remote districts of our kingdom,
were wont to mingle in the conversation, and to tell news that had been gathered in foreign
lands, or preserved from oblivion in this our own. Now I chanced to have contracted for teaching
the lower classes with a young person called Peter, or Patrick, Pattieson, who had been educated
for our Holy Kirk, yea, had, by the license of presbytery, his voice opened therein as a preacher,
who delighted in the collection of olden tales and legends, and in garnishing them with the
flowers of poesy, whereof he was a vain and frivolous professor. For he followed not the example
of those strong poets whom I proposed to him as a pattern, but formed versification of a flimsy
and modern texture, to the compounding whereof was necessary small pains and less thought.
And hence I have chid him as being one of those who bring forward the fatal revolution prophesied
by Mr. Robert Carey, in his Vaticination on the Death of the celebrated Dr. John Donne:

          Now thou art gone, and thy strict laws will be
          Too hard for libertines in poetry;
          Till verse (by thee refined) in this last age
          Turn ballad rhyme.

I had also disputations with him touching his indulging rather a flowing and redundant than
a concise and stately diction in his prose exercitations. But notwithstanding these symptoms
of inferior taste, and a humour of contradicting his betters upon passages of dubious construction
in Latin authors, I did grievously lament when Peter Pattieson was removed from me by death,
even as if he had been the offspring of my own loins. And in respect his papers had been left
in my care, (to answer funeral and death-bed expenses,) I conceived myself entitled to dispose
of one parcel thereof, entitled, "Tales of my Landlord," to one cunning in the trade (as it
is called) of book selling. He was a mirthful man, of small stature, cunning in counterfeiting
of voices, and in making facetious tales and responses, and whom I have to laud for the truth
of his dealings towards me. Now, therefore, the world may see the injustice that charges me
with incapacity to write these narratives, seeing, that though I have proved that I could have
written them if I would, yet, not having done so, the censure will deservedly fall, if at all
due, upon the memory of Mr. Peter Pattieson; whereas I must be justly entitled to the praise,
when any is due, seeing that, as the Dean of St. Patrick's wittily and logically expresseth it,

               That without which a thing is not,
               Is Causa sine qua non.

The work, therefore, is unto me as a child is to a parent; in the which child, if it proveth
worthy, the parent hath honour and praise; but, if otherwise, the disgrace will deservedly
attach to itself alone.

I have only further to intimate, that Mr. Peter Pattieson, in arranging
these Tales for the press, hath more consulted his own fancy than the
accuracy of the narrative; nay, that he hath sometimes blended two or
three stories together for the mere grace of his plots. Of which
infidelity, although I disapprove and enter my testimony against it, yet
I have not taken upon me to correct the same, in respect it was the will
of the deceased, that his manuscript should be submitted to the press
without diminution or alteration. A fanciful nicety it was on the part of
my deceased friend, who, if thinking wisely, ought rather to have
conjured me, by all the tender ties of our friendship and common
pursuits, to have carefully revised, altered, and augmented, at my
judgment and discretion. But the will of the dead must be scrupulously
obeyed, even when we weep over their pertinacity and self-delusion. So,
gentle reader, I bid you farewell, recommending you to such fare as the
mountains of your own country produce; and I will only farther premise,
that each Tale is preceded by a short introduction, mentioning the
persons by whom, and the circumstances under which, the materials thereof
were collected.
                                   JEDEDIAH CLEISHBOTHAM.

INTRODUCTION TO OLD MORTALITY.

The remarkable person, called by the title of Old Mortality, was we'll known in Scotland about
the end of the last century. His real name was Robert Paterson. He was a native, it is said,
of the parish of Closeburn, in Dumfries-shire, and probably a mason by profession--at least
educated to the use of the chisel. Whether family dissensions, or the deep and enthusiastic
feeling of supposed duty, drove him to leave his dwelling, and adopt the singular mode of life
in which he wandered, like a palmer, through Scotland, is not known. It could not be poverty,
however, which prompted his journeys, for he never accepted anything beyond the hospitality
which was willingly rendered him, and when that was not proffered, he always had money enough
to provide for his own humble wants. His personal appearance, and favourite, or rather sole
occupation, are accurately described in the preliminary chapter of the following work.

It is about thirty years since, or more, that the author met this singular person in the churchyard
of Dunnottar, when spending a day or two with the late learned and excellent clergyman, Mr.
Walker, the minister of that parish, for the purpose of a close examination of the ruins of
the Castle of Dunnottar, and other subjects of antiquarian research in that neighbourhood.
Old Mortality chanced to be at the same place, on the usual business of his pilgrimage; for
the Castle of Dunnottar, though lying in the anti-covenanting district of the Mearns, was,
with the parish churchyard, celebrated for the oppressions sustained there by the Cameronians
in the time of James II.

It was in 1685, when Argyle was threatening a descent upon Scotland, and Monmouth was preparing
to invade the west of England, that the Privy Council of Scotland, with cruel precaution, made
a general arrest of more than a hundred persons in the southern and western provinces, supposed,
from their religious principles, to be inimical to Government, together with many women and
children. These captives were driven northward like a flock of bullocks, but with less precaution
to provide for their wants, and finally penned up in a subterranean dungeon in the Castle of
Dunnottar, having a window opening to the front of a precipice which overhangs the German Ocean.
They had suffered not a little on the journey, and were much hurt both at the scoffs of the
northern prelatists, and the mocks, gibes, and contemptuous tunes played by the fiddlers and
pipers who had come from every quarter as they passed, to triumph over the revilers of their
calling. The repose which the melancholy dungeon afforded them, was anything but undisturbed.
The guards made them pay for every indulgence, even that of water; and when some of the prisoners
resisted a demand so unreasonable, and insisted on their right to have this necessary of life
untaxed, their keepers emptied the water on the prison floor, saying, "If they were obliged
to bring water for the canting whigs, they were not bound to afford them the use of bowls or
pitchers gratis."

In this prison, which is still termed the Whig's Vault, several died of the diseases incidental
to such a situation; and others broke their limbs, and incurred fatal injury, in desperate
attempts to escape from their stern prison-house. Over the graves of these unhappy persons,
their friends, after the Revolution, erected a monument with a suitable inscription.

This peculiar shrine of the Whig martyrs is very much honoured by their descendants, though
residing at a great distance from the land of their captivity and death. My friend, the Rev.
Mr. Walker, told me, that being once upon a tour in the south of Scotland, probably about forty
years since, he had the bad luck to involve himself in the labyrinth of passages and tracks
which cross, in every direction, the extensive waste called Lochar Moss, near Dumfries, out
of which it is scarcely possible for a stranger to extricate himself; and there was no small
difficulty in procuring a guide, since such people as he saw were engaged in digging their
peats--a work of paramount necessity, which will hardly brook interruption. Mr. Walker could,
therefore, only procure unintelligible directions in the southern brogue, which differs widely
from that of the Mearns. He was beginning to think himself in a serious dilemma, when he stated
his case to a farmer of rather the better class, who was employed, as the others, in digging
his winter fuel. The old man at first made the same excuse with those who had already declined
acting as the traveller's guide; but perceiving him in great perplexity, and paying the respect
due to his profession, "You are a clergyman, sir?" he said. Mr. Walker assented. "And I observe
from your speech, that you are from the north?"--"You are right, my good friend," was the reply.
"And may I ask if you have ever heard of a place called Dunnottar?"--"I ought to know something
about it, my friend," said Mr. Walker, "since I have been several years the minister of the
parish."--"I am glad to hear it," said the Dumfriesian, "for one of my near relations lies
buried there, and there is, I believe, a monument over his grave. I would give half of what
I am aught, to know if it is still in existence."--"He was one of those who perished in the
Whig's Vault at the castle?" said the minister; "for there are few southlanders besides lying
in our churchyard, and none, I think, having monuments."--"Even sae--even sae," said the old
Cameronian, for such was the farmer. He then laid down his spade, cast on his coat, and heartily
offered to see the minister out of the moss, if he should lose the rest of the day's dargue.
Mr. Walker was able to requite him amply, in his opinion, by reciting the epitaph, which he
remembered by heart. The old man was enchanted with finding the memory of his grandfather or
great-grandfather faithfully recorded amongst the names of brother sufferers; and rejecting
all other offers of recompense, only requested, after he had guided Mr. Walker to a safe and
dry road, that he would let him have a written copy of the inscription.

It was whilst I was listening to this story, and looking at the monument referred to, that
I saw Old Mortality engaged in his daily task of cleaning and repairing the ornaments and epitaphs
upon the tomb. His appearance and equipment were exactly as described in the Novel. I was very
desirous to see something of a person so singular, and expected to have done so, as he took
up his quarters with the hospitable and liberal-spirited minister. But though Mr. Walker invited
him up after dinner to partake of a glass of spirits and water, to which he was supposed not
to be very averse, yet he would not speak frankly upon the subject of his occupation. Perhaps,
after all, he did not feel himself at ease with his company; he might suspect the questions
asked by a north-country minister and a young barrister to savour more of idle curiosity than
profit. At any rate, in the phrase of John Bunyan, Old Mortality went on his way, and I saw
him no more.

The remarkable figure and occupation of this ancient pilgrim was recalled to my memory by an
account transmitted by my friend Mr. Joseph Train, supervisor of excise at Dumfries, to whom
I owe many obligations of a similar nature. From this, besides some other circumstances, among
which are those of the old man's death, I learned the particulars described in the text. I
am also informed, that the old palmer's family, in the third generation, survives, and is highly
respected both for talents and worth. While these sheets were passing through the press, I
received the following communication from Mr. Train, whose undeviating kindness had, during
the intervals of laborious duty, collected its materials from an indubitable source.

     "In the course of my periodical visits to the Glenkens, I have
     become intimately acquainted with Robert Paterson, a son of Old
     Mortality, who lives in the little village of Balmaclellan; and
     although he is now in the 70th year of his age, preserves all the
     vivacity of youth--has a most retentive memory, and a mind stored
     with information far above what could be expected from a person in
     his station of life. To him I am indebted for the following
     particulars relative to his father, and his descendants down to the
     present time.

     "Robert Paterson, alias Old Mortality, was the son of Walter
     Paterson and Margaret Scott, who occupied the farm of Ilaggisha, in
     the parish of Hawick, during nearly the first half of the eighteenth
     century. Here Robert was born, in the memorable year 1715.

     "Being the youngest son of a numerous family, he, at an early age,
     went to serve with an elder brother, named Francis, who rented, from
     Sir John Jardine of Applegarth, a small tract in Comcockle Moor,
     near Lochmaben. During his residence there, he became acquainted
     with Elizabeth Gray, daughter of Robert Gray, gardener to Sir John
     Jardine, whom he afterwards married. His wife had been, for a
     considerable time, a cook-maid to Sir Thomas Kirkpatrick of
     Closeburn, who procured for her husband, from the Duke of
     Queensberry, an advantageous lease of the freestone quarry of
     Gatelowbrigg, in the parish of Morton. Here he built a house, and
     had as much land as kept a horse and cow. My informant cannot say,
     with certainty, the year in which his father took up his residence
     at Gatelowbrigg, but he is sure it must have been only a short time
     prior to the year 1746, as, during the memorable frost in 1740, he
     says his mother still resided in the service of Sir Thomas
     Kirkpatrick. When the Highlanders were returning from England on
     their route to Glasgow, in the year 1745-6, they plundered Mr.
     Paterson's house at Gatelowbrigg, and carried him a prisoner as far
     as Glenbuck, merely because he said to one of the straggling army,
     that their retreat might have been easily foreseen, as the strong
     arm of the Lord was evidently raised, not only against the bloody
     and wicked house of Stewart, but against all who attempted to
     support the abominable heresies of the Church of Rome. From this
     circumstance it appears that Old Mortality had, even at that early
     period of his life, imbibed the religious enthusiasm by which he
     afterwards became so much distinguished.

     "The religious sect called Hill-men, or Cameronians, was at that
     time much noted for austerity and devotion, in imitation of Cameron,
     their founder, of whose tenets Old Mortality became a most strenuous
     supporter. He made frequent journeys into Galloway to attend their
     conventicles, and occasionally carried with him gravestones from his
     quarry at Gatelowbrigg, to keep in remembrance the righteous whose
     dust had been gathered to their fathers. Old Mortality was not one
     of those religious devotees, who, although one eye is seemingly
     turned towards heaven, keep the other steadfastly fixed on some
     sublunary object. As his enthusiasm increased, his journeys into
     Galloway became more frequent; and he gradually neglected even the
     common prudential duty of providing for his offspring. From about
     the year 1758, he neglected wholly to return from Galloway to his
     wife and five children at Gatelowbrigg, which induced her to send
     her eldest son Walter, then only twelve years of age, to Galloway,
     in search of his father. After traversing nearly the whole of that
     extensive district, from the Nick of Benncorie to the Fell of
     Barullion, he found him at last working on the Cameronian monuments,
     in the old kirkyard of Kirkchrist, on the west side of the Dee,
     opposite the town of Kirkcudbright. The little wanderer used all the
     influence in his power to induce his father to return to his family;
     but in vain. Mrs. Paterson sent even some of her female children
     into Galloway in search of their father, for the same purpose of
     persuading him to return home; but without any success. At last, in
     the summer of 1768, she removed to the little upland village of
     Balmaclellan, in the Glenkens of Galloway, where, upon the small
     pittance derived from keeping a little school, she supported her
     numerous family in a respectable manner.

     "There is a small monumental stone in the farm of the Caldon, near
     the House of the Hill, in Wigtonshire, which is highly venerated as
     being the first erected, by Old Mortality, to the memory of several
     persons who fell at that place in defence of their religious tenets
     in the civil war, in the reign of Charles Second.

     "From the Caldon, the labours of Old Mortality, in the course of
     time, spread over nearly all the Lowlands of Scotland. There are few
     churchyards in Ayrshire, Galloway, or Dumfries-shire, where the work
     of his chisel is not yet to be seen. It is easily distinguished from
     the work of any other artist by the primitive rudeness of the
     emblems of death, and of the inscriptions which adorn the ill-formed
     blocks of his erection. This task of repairing and erecting
     gravestones, practised without fee or reward, was the only
     ostensible employment of this singular person for upwards of forty
     years. The door of every Cameronian's house was indeed open to him
     at all times when he chose to enter, and he was gladly received as
     an inmate of the family; but he did not invariably accept of these
     civilities, as may be seen by the following account of his frugal
     expenses, found, amongst other little papers, (some of which I have
     likewise in my possession,) in his pocket-book after his death.

"This statement shows the religious wanderer to have been very poor in his old age; but he
was so more by choice than through necessity, as at the period here alluded to, his children
were all comfortably situated, and were most anxious to keep their father at home, but no entreaty
could induce him to alter his erratic way of life. He travelled from one churchyard to another,
mounted on his old white pony, till the last day of his existence, and died, as you have described,
at Bankhill, near Lockerby, on the 14th February, 1801, in the 86th year of his age. As soon
as his body was found, intimation was sent to his sons at Balmaclellan; but from the great
depth of the snow at that time, the letter communicating the particulars of his death was so
long detained by the way, that the remains of the pilgrim were interred before any of his relations
could arrive at Bankhill.

"The following is an exact copy of the account of his funeral expenses,--the original of which
I have in my possession:--

"The above account is authenticated by the son of the deceased.

"My friend was prevented by indisposition from even going to Bankhill to attend the funeral
of his father, which I regret very much, as he is not aware in what churchyard he was interred.

"For the purpose of erecting a small monument to his memory, I have made every possible enquiry,
wherever I thought there was the least chance of finding out where Old Mortality was laid;
but I have done so in vain, as his death is not registered in the session-book of any of the
neighbouring parishes. I am sorry to think, that in all probability, this singular person,
who spent so many years of his lengthened existence in striving with his chisel and mallet
to perpetuate the memory of many less deserving than himself, must remain even without a single
stone to mark out the resting place of his mortal remains.

"Old Mortality had three sons, Robert, Walter, and John; the former, as has been already mentioned,
lives in the village of Balmaclellan, in comfortable circumstances, and is much respected by
his neighbours. Walter died several years ago, leaving behind him a family now respectably
situated in this point. John went to America in the year 1776, and, after various turns of
fortune, settled at Baltimore."

Old Nol himself is said to have loved an innocent jest. (See Captain Hodgson's Memoirs.) Old
Mortality somewhat resembled the Protector in this turn to festivity. Like Master Silence,
he had been merry twice and once in his time; but even his jests were of a melancholy and sepulchral
nature, and sometimes attended with inconvenience to himself, as will appear from the following
anecdote:--

The old man was at one time following his wonted occupation of repairing the tombs of the martyrs,
in the churchyard of Girthon, and the sexton of the parish was plying his kindred task at no
small distance. Some roguish urchins were sporting near them, and by their noisy gambols disturbing
the old men in their serious occupation. The most petulant of the juvenile party were two or
three boys, grandchildren of a person well known by the name of Cooper Climent. This artist
enjoyed almost a monopoly in Girthon and the neighbouring parishes, for making and selling
ladles, caups, bickers, bowls, spoons, cogues, and trenchers, formed of wood, for the use of
the country people. It must be noticed, that notwithstanding the excellence of the Cooper's
vessels, they were apt, when new, to impart a reddish tinge to whatever liquor was put into
them, a circumstance not uncommon in like cases.

The grandchildren of this dealer in wooden work took it into their head to ask the sexton,
what use he could possibly make of the numerous fragments of old coffins which were thrown
up in opening new graves. "Do you not know," said Old Mortality, "that he sells them to your
grandfather, who makes them into spoons, trenchers, bickers, bowies, and so forth?" At this
assertion, the youthful group broke up in great confusion and disgust, on reflecting how many
meals they had eaten out of dishes which, by Old Mortality's account, were only fit to be used
at a banquet of witches or of ghoules. They carried the tidings home, when many a dinner was
spoiled by the loathing which the intelligence imparted; for the account of the materials was
supposed to explain the reddish tinge which, even in the days of the Cooper's fame, had seemed
somewhat suspicious. The ware of Cooper Climent was rejected in horror, much to the benefit
of his rivals the muggers, who dealt in earthenware. The man of cutty-spoon and ladle saw his
trade interrupted, and learned the reason, by his quondam customers coming upon him in wrath
to return the goods which were composed of such unhallowed materials, and demand repayment
of their money. In this disagreeable predicament, the forlorn artist cited Old Mortality into
a court of justice, where he proved that the wood he used in his trade was that of the staves
of old wine-pipes bought from smugglers, with whom the country then abounded, a circumstance
which fully accounted for their imparting a colour to their contents. Old Mortality himself
made the fullest declaration, that he had no other purpose in making the assertion, than to
check the petulance of the children. But it is easier to take away a good name than to restore
it. Cooper Climent's business continued to languish, and he died in a state of poverty.

CHAPTER I.

Preliminary.

                    Why seeks he with unwearied toil
                    Through death's dim walks to urge his way,
                    Reclaim his long-asserted spoil,
                    And lead oblivion into day?
                                        Langhorne.

"Most readers," says the Manuscript of Mr Pattieson, "must have witnessed with delight the
joyous burst which attends the dismissing of a village-school on a fine summer evening. The
buoyant spirit of childhood, repressed with so much difficulty during the tedious hours of
discipline, may then be seen to explode, as it were, in shout, and song, and frolic, as the
little urchins join in groups on their play-ground, and arrange their matches of sport for
the evening. But there is one individual who partakes of the relief afforded by the moment
of dismission, whose feelings are not so obvious to the eye of the spectator, or so apt to
receive his sympathy. Even the flowers of classic genius, with which his solitary fancy is
most gratified, have been rendered degraded, in his imagination, by their connexion with tears,
with errors, and with punishment; so that the Eclogues of Virgil and Odes of Horace are each
inseparably allied in association with the sullen figure and monotonous recitation of some
blubbering school-boy. If to these mental distresses are added a delicate frame of body, and
a mind ambitious of some higher distinction than that of being the tyrant of childhood, the
reader may have some slight conception of the relief which a solitary walk, in the cool of
a fine summer evening, affords to the head which has ached, and the nerves which have been
shattered, for so many hours, in plying the irksome task of public instruction.

"To me these evening strolls have been the happiest hours of an unhappy life; and if any gentle
reader shall hereafter find pleasure in perusing these lucubrations, I am not unwilling he
should know, that the plan of them has been usually traced in those moments, when relief from
toil and clamour, combined with the quiet scenery around me, has disposed my mind to the task
of composition.

"My chief haunt, in these hours of golden leisure, is the banks of the small stream, which,
winding through a 'lone vale of green bracken,' passes in front of the village school-house
of Gandercleugh. For the first quarter of a mile, perhaps, I may be disturbed from my meditations,
in order to return the scrape, or doffed bonnet, of such stragglers among my pupils as fish
for trouts or minnows in the little brook, or seek rushes and wild-flowers by its margin. But,
beyond the space I have mentioned, the juvenile anglers do not, after sunset, voluntarily extend
their excursions. The cause is, that farther up the narrow valley, and in a recess which seems
scooped out of the side of the steep heathy bank, there is a deserted burial-ground, which
the little cowards are fearful of approaching in the twilight. To me, however, the place has
an inexpressible charm. It has been long the favourite termination of my walks, and, if my
kind patron forgets not his promise, will (and probably at no very distant day) be my final
resting-place after my mortal pilgrimage. [Note: Note, by Mr Jedediah Cleishbotham.--That I
kept my plight in this melancholy matter with my deceased and lamented friend, appeareth from
a handsome headstone, erected at my proper charges in this spot, bearing the name and calling
of Peter Pattieson, with the date of his nativity and sepulture; together also with a testimony
of his merits, attested by myself, as his superior and patron.--J. C.]

"It is a spot which possesses all the solemnity of feeling attached to a burial-ground, without
exciting those of a more unpleasing description. Having been very little used for many years,
the few hillocks which rise above the level plain are covered with the same short velvet turf.
The monuments, of which there are not above seven or eight, are half sunk in the ground, and
overgrown with moss. No newly-erected tomb disturbs the sober serenity of our reflections by
reminding us of recent calamity, and no rank-springing grass forces upon our imagination the
recollection, that it owes its dark luxuriance to the foul and festering remnants of mortality
which ferment beneath. The daisy which sprinkles the sod, and the harebell which hangs over
it, derive their pure nourishment from the dew of heaven, and their growth impresses us with
no degrading or disgusting recollections. Death has indeed been here, and its traces are before
us; but they are softened and deprived of their horror by our distance from the period when
they have been first impressed. Those who sleep beneath are only connected with us by the reflection,
that they have once been what we now are, and that, as their relics are now identified with
their mother earth, ours shall, at some future period, undergo the same transformation.

"Yet, although the moss has been collected on the most modern of these humble tombs during
four generations of mankind, the memory of some of those who sleep beneath them is still held
in reverent remembrance. It is true, that, upon the largest, and, to an antiquary, the most
interesting monument of the group, which bears the effigies of a doughty knight in his hood
of mail, with his shield hanging on his breast, the armorial bearings are defaced by time,
and a few worn-out letters may be read at the pleasure of the decipherer, Dns. Johan--de Hamel,--or
Johan--de Lamel--And it is also true, that of another tomb, richly sculptured with an ornamental
cross, mitre, and pastoral staff, tradition can only aver, that a certain nameless bishop lies
interred there. But upon other two stones which lie beside, may still be read in rude prose,
and ruder rhyme, the history of those who sleep beneath them. They belong, we are assured by
the epitaph, to the class of persecuted Presbyterians who afforded a melancholy subject for
history in the times of Charles II. and his successor. As he keep Wood, who was however to be of

 If recollection of former injuries, extra-loyalty,
and contempt and hatred of their adversaries, produced rigour and tyranny in the one party,
it will hardly be denied, on the other hand, that, if the zeal for God's house did not eat
up the conventiclers, it devoured at least, to imitate the phrase of Dryden, no small portion
of their loyalty, sober sense, and good breeding. We may safely hope, that the souls of the
brave and sincere on either side have long looked down with surprise and pity upon the ill-appreciated
motives which caused their mutual hatred and hostility, while in this valley of darkness, blood,
and tears. Peace to their memory! Let us think of them as the heroine of our only Scottish
tragedy entreats her lord to think of her departed sire:--

               'O rake not up the ashes of our fathers!
               Implacable resentment was their crime,
               And grievous has the expiation been.'"

CHAPTER II.

               Summon an hundred horse, by break of day,
               To wait our pleasure at the castle gates.
                                                  Douglas.

Under the reign of the last Stewarts, there was an anxious wish on the part of government to
counteract, by every means in their power, the strict or puritanical spirit which had been
the chief characteristic of the republican government, and to revive those feudal institutions
which united the vassal to the liege lord, and both to the crown. Frequent musters and assemblies
of the people, both for military exercise and for sports and pastimes, were appointed by authority.
The interference, in the latter case, was impolitic, to say the least; for, as usual on such
occasions, the consciences which were at first only scrupulous, became confirmed in their opinions,
instead of giving way to the terrors of authority; and the youth of both sexes, to whom the
pipe and tabor in England, or the bagpipe in Scotland, would have been in themselves an irresistible
temptation, were enabled to set them at defiance, from the proud consciousness that they were,
at the same time, resisting an act of council. To compel men to dance and be merry by authority,
has rarely succeeded even on board of slave-ships, where it was formerly sometimes attempted
by way of inducing the wretched captives to agitate their limbs and restore the circulation,
during the few minutes they were permitted to enjoy the fresh air upon deck. The rigour of
the strict Calvinists increased, in proportion to the wishes of the government that it should
be relaxed. A judaical observance of the Sabbath--a supercilious condemnation of all manly
pastimes and harmless recreations, as well as of the profane custom of promiscuous dancing,
that is, of men and women dancing together in the same party (for I believe they admitted that
the exercise might be inoffensive if practised by the parties separately)--distinguishing those
who professed a more than ordinary share of sanctity, they discouraged, as far as lay in their
power, even the ancient wappen-schaws, as they were termed, when the feudal array of the county
was called out, and each crown-vassal was required to appear with such muster of men and armour
as he was bound to make by his fief, and that under high statutory penalties. The Covenanters
were the more jealous of those assemblies, as the lord lieutenants and sheriffs under whom
they were held had instructions from the government to spare no pains which might render them
agreeable to the young men who were thus summoned together, upon whom the military exercise
of the morning, and the sports which usually closed the evening, might naturally be supposed
to have a seductive effect.

The preachers and proselytes of the more rigid presbyterians laboured, therefore, by caution,
remonstrance, and authority, to diminish the attendance upon these summonses, conscious that
in doing so, they lessened not only the apparent, but the actual strength of the government,
by impeding the extension of that esprit de corps which soon unites young men who are in the
habit of meeting together for manly sport, or military exercise. They, therefore, exerted themselves
earnestly to prevent attendance on these occasions by those who could find any possible excuse
for absence, and were especially severe upon such of their hearers as mere curiosity led to
be spectators, or love of exercise to be partakers, of the array and the sports which took
place. Such of the gentry as acceded to these doctrines were not always, however, in a situation
to be ruled by them. The commands of the law were imperative; and the privy council, who administered
the executive power in Scotland, were severe in enforcing the statutory penalties against the
crown-vassals who did not appear at the periodical wappen-schaw. The landholders were compelled,
therefore, to send their sons, tenants, and vassals to the rendezvous, to the number of horses,
men, and spears, at which they were rated; and it frequently happened, that notwithstanding
the strict charge of their elders, to return as soon as the formal inspection was over, the
young men-at-arms were unable to resist the temptation of sharing in the sports which succeeded
the muster, or to avoid listening to the prayers read in the churches on these occasions, and
thus, in the opinion of their repining parents, meddling with the accursed thing which is an
abomination in the sight of the Lord.

The sheriff of the county of Lanark was holding the wappen-schaw of a wild district, called
the Upper Ward of Clydesdale, on a haugh or level plain, near to a royal borough, the name
of which is no way essential to my story, on the morning of the 5th of May, 1679, when our
narrative commences. When the musters had been made, and duly reported, the young men, as was
usual, were to mix in various sports, of which the chief was to shoot at the popinjay, an ancient
game formerly practised with archery, but at this period with fire-arms.

     [Note: Festival of the Popinjay. The Festival of the Popinjay is
     still, I believe, practised at Maybole, in Ayrshire. The following
     passage in the history of the Somerville family, suggested the
     scenes in the text. The author of that curious manuscript thus
     celebrates his father's demeanour at such an assembly.

     "Having now passed his infancie, in the tenth year of his age, he
     was by his grandfather putt to the grammar school, ther being then
     att the toune of Delserf a very able master that taught the grammar,
     and fitted boyes for the colledge. Dureing his educating in this
     place, they had then a custome every year to solemnize the first
     Sunday of May with danceing about a May-pole, fyreing of pieces, and
     all manner of ravelling then in use. Ther being at that tyme feu or
     noe merchants in this pettie village, to furnish necessaries for the
     schollars sports, this youth resolves to provide himself elsewhere,
     so that he may appear with the bravest. In order to this, by break
     of day he ryses and goes to Hamiltoune, and there bestowes all the
     money that for a long tyme before he had gotten from his freinds, or
     had otherwayes purchased, upon ribbones of diverse coloures, a new
     hatt and gloves. But in nothing he bestowed his money more
     liberallie than upon gunpowder, a great quantitie whereof he buyes
     for his owne use, and to supplie the wantes of his comerades; thus
     furnished with these commodities, but ane empty purse, he returnes
     to Delserf by seven a clock, (haveing travelled that Sabbath morning
     above eight myles,) puttes on his cloathes and new hatt, flying with
     ribbones of all culloures; and in this equipage, with his little
     phizie (fusee) upon his shoulder, he marches to the church yaird,
     where the May-pole was sett up, and the solemnitie of that day was
     to be kept. There first at the foot-ball he equalled any one that
     played; but in handleing his piece, in chargeing and dischargeing,
     he was so ready, and shott so near the marke, that he farre
     surpassed all his fellow schollars, and became a teacher of that art
     to them before the thretteenth year of his oune age. And really, I
     have often admired his dexterity in this, both at the exercizeing of
     his soulders, and when for recreatione. I have gone to the gunning
     with him when I was but a stripeling myself; and albeit that
     passetyme was the exercize I delighted most in, yet could I never
     attaine to any perfectione comparable to him.

It will, of course, be supposed, that the ladies of the country assembled to witness this gallant
strife, those excepted who held the stricter tenets of puritanism, and would therefore have
deemed it criminal to afford countenance to the profane gambols of the malignants. Landaus,
barouches, or tilburies, there were none in those simple days. The lord lieutenant of the county
(a personage of ducal rank) alone pretended to the magnificence of a wheel-carriage, a thing
covered with tarnished gilding and sculpture, in shape like the vulgar picture of Noah's ark,
dragged by eight long-tailed Flanders mares, bearing eight insides and six outsides. The insides
were their graces in person, two maids of honour, two children, a chaplain stuffed into a sort
of lateral recess, formed by a projection at the door of the vehicle, and called, from its
appearance, the boot, and an equerry to his Grace ensconced in the corresponding convenience
on the opposite side. A coachman and three postilions, who wore short swords, and tie-wigs
with three tails, had blunderbusses slung behind them, and pistols at their saddle-bow, conducted
the equipage. On the foot-board, behind this moving mansion-house, stood, or rather hung, in
triple file, six lacqueys in rich liveries, armed up to the teeth. The rest of the gentry,
men and women, old and young, were on horseback followed by their servants; but the company,
for the reasons already assigned, was rather select than numerous.

Near to the enormous leathern vehicle which we have attempted to describe, vindicating her
title to precedence over the untitled gentry of the country, might be seen the sober palfrey
of Lady Margaret Bellenden, bearing the erect and primitive form of Lady Margaret herself,
decked in those widow's weeds which the good lady had never laid aside, since the execution
of her husband for his adherence to Montrose.

Her grand-daughter, and only earthly care, the fair-haired Edith, who was generally allowed
to be the prettiest lass in the Upper Ward, appeared beside her aged relative like Spring placed
close to Winter. Her black Spanish jennet, which she managed with much grace, her gay riding-dress,
and laced side-saddle, had been anxiously prepared to set her forth to the best advantage.
But the clustering profusion of ringlets, which, escaping from under her cap, were only confined
by a green ribbon from wantoning over her shoulders; her cast of features, soft and feminine,
yet not without a certain expression of playful archness, which redeemed their sweetness from
the charge of insipidity, sometimes brought against blondes and blue-eyed beauties,--these
attracted more admiration from the western youth than either the splendour of her equipments
or the figure of her palfrey.

The attendance of these distinguished ladies was rather inferior to their birth and fashion
in those times, as it consisted only of two servants on horseback. The truth was, that the
good old lady had been obliged to make all her domestic servants turn out to complete the quota
which her barony ought to furnish for the muster, and in which she would not for the universe
have been found deficient. The old steward, who, in steel cap and jack-boots, led forth her
array, had, as he said, sweated blood and water in his efforts to overcome the scruples and
evasions of the moorland farmers, who ought to have furnished men, horse, and harness, on these
occasions. At last, their dispute came near to an open declaration of hostilities, the incensed
episcopalian bestowing on the recusants the whole thunders of the commination, and receiving
from them, in return, the denunciations of a Calvinistic excommunication. What was to be done?
To punish the refractory tenants would have been easy enough. The privy council would readily
have imposed fines, and sent a troop of horse to collect them. But this would have been calling
the huntsman and hounds into the garden to kill the hare.

"For," said Harrison to himself, "the carles have little eneugh gear at ony rate, and if I
call in the red-coats and take away what little they have, how is my worshipful lady to get
her rents paid at Candlemas, which is but a difficult matter to bring round even in the best
of times?"

So he armed the fowler, and falconer, the footman, and the ploughman, at the home farm, with
an old drunken cavaliering butler, who had served with the late Sir Richard under Montrose,
and stunned the family nightly with his exploits at Kilsythe and Tippermoor, and who was the
only man in the party that had the smallest zeal for the work in hand. In this manner, and
by recruiting one or two latitudinarian poachers and black-fishers, Mr Harrison completed the
quota of men which fell to the share of Lady Margaret Bellenden, as life-rentrix of the barony
of Tillietudlem and others. But when the steward, on the morning of the eventful day, had mustered
his troupe dore before the iron gate of the tower, the mother of Cuddie Headrigg the ploughman
appeared, loaded with the jackboots, buff coat, and other accoutrements which had been issued
forth for the service of the day, and laid them before the steward; demurely assuring him,
that "whether it were the colic, or a qualm of conscience, she couldna tak upon her to decide,
but sure it was, Cuddie had been in sair straits a' night, and she couldna say he was muckle
better this morning. The finger of Heaven," she said, "was in it, and her bairn should gang
on nae sic errands." Pains, penalties, and threats of dismission, were denounced in vain; the
mother was obstinate, and Cuddie, who underwent a domiciliary visitation for the purpose of
verifying his state of body, could, or would, answer only by deep groans. Mause, who had been
an ancient domestic in the family, was a sort of favourite with Lady Margaret, and presumed
accordingly. Lady Margaret had herself set forth, and her authority could not be appealed to.
In this dilemma, the good genius of the old butler suggested an expedient.

"He had seen mony a braw callant, far less than Guse Gibbie, fight brawly under Montrose. What
for no tak Guse Gibbie?"

This was a half-witted lad, of very small stature, who had a kind of charge of the poultry
under the old henwife; for in a Scottish family of that day there was a wonderful substitution
of labour. This urchin being sent for from the stubble-field, was hastily muffled in the buff
coat, and girded rather to than with the sword of a full-grown man, his little legs plunged
into jack-boots, and a steel cap put upon his head, which seemed, from its size, as if it had
been intended to extinguish him. Thus accoutred, he was hoisted, at his own earnest request,
upon the quietest horse of the party; and, prompted and supported by old Gudyill the butler,
as his front file, he passed muster tolerably enough; the sheriff not caring to examine too
closely the recruits of so well-affected a person as Lady Margaret Bellenden.

To the above cause it was owing that the personal retinue of Lady Margaret, on this eventful
day, amounted only to two lacqueys, with which diminished train she would, on any other occasion,
have been much ashamed to appear in public. But, for the cause of royalty, she was ready at
any time to have made the most unreserved personal sacrifices. She had lost her husband and
two promising sons in the civil wars of that unhappy period; but she had received her reward,
for, on his route through the west of Scotland to meet Cromwell in the unfortunate field of
Worcester, Charles the Second had actually breakfasted at the Tower of Tillietudlem; an incident
which formed, from that moment, an important era in the life of Lady Margaret, who seldom afterwards
partook of that meal, either at home or abroad, without detailing the whole circumstances of
the royal visit, not forgetting the salutation which his majesty conferred on each side of
her face, though she sometimes omitted to notice that he bestowed the same favour on two buxom
serving-wenches who appeared at her back, elevated for the day into the capacity of waiting
gentlewomen.

These instances of royal favour were decisive; and if Lady Margaret had not been a confirmed
royalist already, from sense of high birth, influence of education, and hatred to the opposite
party, through whom she had suffered such domestic calamity, the having given a breakfast to
majesty, and received the royal salute in return, were honours enough of themselves to unite
her exclusively to the fortunes of the Stewarts. These were now, in all appearance, triumphant;
but Lady Margaret's zeal had adhered to them through the worst of times, and was ready to sustain
the same severities of fortune should their scale once more kick the beam. At present she enjoyed,
in full extent, the military display of the force which stood ready to support the crown, and
stifled, as well as she could, the mortification she felt at the unworthy desertion of her
own retainers.

Many civilities passed between her ladyship and the representatives of sundry ancient loyal
families who were upon the ground, by whom she was held in high reverence; and not a young
man of rank passed by them in the course of the muster, but he carried his body more erect
in the saddle, and threw his horse upon its haunches, to display his own horsemanship and the
perfect bitting of his steed to the best advantage in the eyes of Miss Edith Bellenden. But
the young cavaliers, distinguished by high descent and undoubted loyalty, attracted no more
attention from Edith than the laws of courtesy peremptorily demanded; and she turned an indifferent
ear to the compliments with which she was addressed, most of which were little the worse for
the wear, though borrowed for the nonce from the laborious and long-winded romances of Calprenede
and Scuderi, the mirrors in which the youth of that age delighted to dress themselves, ere
Folly had thrown her ballast overboard, and cut down her vessels of the first-rate, such as
the romances of Cyrus, Cleopatra, and others, into small craft, drawing as little water, or,
to speak more plainly, consuming as little time as the little cockboat in which the gentle
reader has deigned to embark. It was, however, the decree of fate that Miss Bellenden should
not continue to evince the same equanimity till the conclusion of the day.

CHAPTER III.

               Horseman and horse confess'd the bitter pang,
               And arms and warrior fell with heavy clang.
                                             Pleasures of Hope.

When the military evolutions had been gone through tolerably well, allowing for the awkwardness
of men and of horses, a loud shout announced that the competitors were about to step forth
for the game of the popinjay already described. The mast, or pole, having a yard extended across
it, from which the mark was displayed, was raised amid the acclamations of the assembly; and
even those who had eyed the evolutions of the feudal militia with a sort of malignant and sarcastic
sneer, from disinclination to the royal cause in which they were professedly embodied, could
not refrain from taking considerable interest in the strife which was now approaching. They
crowded towards the goal, and criticized the appearance of each competitor, as they advanced
in succession, discharged their pieces at the mark, and had their good or bad address rewarded
by the laughter or applause of the spectators. But when a slender young man, dressed with great
simplicity, yet not without a certain air of pretension to elegance and gentility, approached
the station with his fusee in his hand, his dark-green cloak thrown back over his shoulder,
his laced ruff and feathered cap indicating a superior rank to the vulgar, there was a murmur
of interest among the spectators, whether altogether favourable to the young adventurer, it
was difficult to discover.

"Ewhow, sirs, to see his father's son at the like o' thae fearless follies!" was the ejaculation
of the elder and more rigid puritans, whose curiosity had so far overcome their bigotry as
to bring them to the play-ground. But the generality viewed the strife less morosely, and were
contented to wish success to the son of a deceased presbyterian leader, without strictly examining
the propriety of his being a competitor for the prize.

Their wishes were gratified. At the first discharge of his piece the green adventurer struck
the popinjay, being the first palpable hit of the day, though several balls had passed very
near the mark. A loud shout of applause ensued. But the success was not decisive, it being
necessary that each who followed should have his chance, and that those who succeeded in hitting
the mark, should renew the strife among themselves, till one displayed a decided superiority
over the others. Two only of those who followed in order succeeded in hitting the popinjay.
The first was a young man of low rank, heavily built, and who kept his face muffled in his
grey cloak; the second a gallant young cavalier, remarkable for a handsome exterior, sedulously
decorated for the day. He had been since the muster in close attendance on Lady Margaret and
Miss Bellenden, and had left them with an air of indifference, when Lady Margaret had asked
whether there was no young man of family and loyal principles who would dispute the prize with
the two lads who had been successful. In half a minute, young Lord Evandale threw himself from
his horse, borrowed a gun from a servant, and, as we have already noticed, hit the mark. Great
was the interest excited by the renewal of the contest between the three candidates who had
been hitherto successful. The state equipage of the Duke was, with some difficulty, put in
motion, and approached more near to the scene of action. The riders, both male and female,
turned their horses' heads in the same direction, and all eyes were bent upon the issue of
the trial of skill.

It was the etiquette in the second contest, that the competitors should take their turn of
firing after drawing lots. The first fell upon the young plebeian, who, as he took his stand,
half-uncloaked his rustic countenance, and said to the gallant in green, "Ye see, Mr Henry,
if it were ony other day, I could hae wished to miss for your sake; but Jenny Dennison is looking
at us, sae I maun do my best."

He took his aim, and his bullet whistled past the mark so nearly, that the pendulous object
at which it was directed was seen to shiver. Still, however, he had not hit it, and, with a
downcast look, he withdrew himself from further competition, and hastened to disappear from
the assembly, as if fearful of being recognised. The green chasseur next advanced, and his
ball a second time struck the popinjay. All shouted; and from the outskirts of the assembly
arose a cry of, "The good old cause for ever!"

While the dignitaries bent their brows at these exulting shouts of the disaffected, the young
Lord Evandale advanced again to the hazard, and again was successful. The shouts and congratulations
of the well-affected and aristocratical part of the audience attended his success, but still
a subsequent trial of skill remained.

The green marksman, as if determined to bring the affair to a decision, took his horse from
a person who held him, having previously looked carefully to the security of his girths and
the fitting of his saddle, vaulted on his back, and motioning with his hand for the bystanders
to make way, set spurs, passed the place from which he was to fire at a gallop, and, as he
passed, threw up the reins, turned sideways upon his saddle, discharged his carabine, and brought
down the popinjay. Lord Evandale imitated his example, although many around him said it was
an innovation on the established practice, which he was not obliged to follow. But his skill
was not so perfect, or his horse was not so well trained. The animal swerved at the moment
his master fired, and the ball missed the popinjay. Those who had been surprised by the address
of the green marksman were now equally pleased by his courtesy. He disclaimed all merit from
the last shot, and proposed to his antagonist that it should not be counted as a hit, and that
they should renew the contest on foot.

"I would prefer horseback, if I had a horse as well bitted, and, probably, as well broken to
the exercise, as yours," said the young Lord, addressing his antagonist.

"Will you do me the honour to use him for the next trial, on condition you will lend me yours?"
said the young gentleman.

Lord Evandale was ashamed to accept this courtesy, as conscious how much it would diminish
the value of victory; and yet, unable to suppress his wish to redeem his reputation as a marksman,
he added, "that although he renounced all pretensions to the honour of the day," (which he
said some-what scornfully,) "yet, if the victor had no particular objection, he would willingly
embrace his obliging offer, and change horses with him, for the purpose of trying a shot for love."

As he said so, he looked boldly towards Miss Bellenden, and tradition says, that the eyes of
the young tirailleur travelled, though more covertly, in the same direction. The young Lord's
last trial was as unsuccessful as the former, and it was with difficulty that he preserved
the tone of scornful indifference which he had hitherto assumed. But, conscious of the ridicule
which attaches itself to the resentment of a losing party, he returned to his antagonist the
horse on which he had made his last unsuccessful attempt, and received back his own; giving,
at the same time, thanks to his competitor, who, he said, had re-established his favourite
horse in his good opinion, for he had been in great danger of transferring to the poor nag
the blame of an inferiority, which every one, as well as himself, must now be satisfied remained
with the rider. Having made this speech in a tone in which mortification assumed the veil of
indifference, he mounted his horse and rode off the ground.

As is the usual way of the world, the applause and attention even of those whose wishes had
favoured Lord Evandale, were, upon his decisive discomfiture, transferred to his triumphant rival.

"Who is he? what is his name?" ran from mouth to mouth among the gentry who were present, to
few of whom he was personally known. His style and title having soon transpired, and being
within that class whom a great man might notice without derogation, four of the Duke's friends,
with the obedient start which poor Malvolio ascribes to his imaginary retinue, made out to
lead the victor to his presence. As they conducted him in triumph through the crowd of spectators,
and stunned him at the same time with their compliments on his success, he chanced to pass,
or rather to be led, immediately in front of Lady Margaret and her grand-daughter. The Captain
of the popinjay and Miss Bellenden coloured like crimson, as the latter returned, with embarrassed
courtesy, the low inclination which the victor made, even to the saddle-bow, in passing her.

"Do you know that young person?" said Lady Margaret.

"I--I--have seen him, madam, at my uncle's, and--and elsewhere occasionally," stammered Miss
Edith Bellenden.

"I hear them say around me," said Lady Margaret, "that the young spark is the nephew of old
Milnwood."

"The son of the late Colonel Morton of Milnwood, who commanded a regiment of horse with great
courage at Dunbar and Inverkeithing," said a gentleman who sate on horseback beside Lady Margaret.

"Ay, and who, before that, fought for the Covenanters both at Marston-Moor and Philiphaugh,"
said Lady Margaret, sighing as she pronounced the last fatal words, which her husband's death
gave her such sad reason to remember.

"Your ladyship's memory is just," said the gentleman, smiling, "but it were well all that were
forgot now."

"He ought to remember it, Gilbertscleugh," returned Lady Margaret, "and dispense with intruding
himself into the company of those to whom his name must bring unpleasing recollections."

"You forget, my dear lady," said her nomenclator, "that the young gentleman comes here to discharge
suit and service in name of his uncle. I would every estate in the country sent out as pretty
a fellow."

"His uncle, as well as his umquhile father, is a roundhead, I presume," said Lady Margaret.

"He is an old miser," said Gilbertscleugh, "with whom a broad piece would at any time weigh
down political opinions, and, therefore, although probably somewhat against the grain, he sends
the young gentleman to attend the muster to save pecuniary pains and penalties. As for the
rest, I suppose the youngster is happy enough to escape here for a day from the dulness of
the old house at Milnwood, where he sees nobody but his hypochondriac uncle and the favourite
housekeeper."

"Do you know how many men and horse the lands of Milnwood are rated at?" said the old lady,
continuing her enquiry.

"Two horsemen with complete harness," answered Gilbertscleugh.

"Our land," said Lady Margaret, drawing herself up with dignity, "has always furnished to the
muster eight men, cousin Gilbertscleugh, and often a voluntary aid of thrice the number. I
remember his sacred Majesty King Charles, when he took his disjune at Tillietudlem, was particular
in enquiring"--"I see the Duke's carriage in motion," said Gilbertscleugh, partaking at the
moment an alarm common to all Lady Margaret's friends, when she touched upon the topic of the
royal visit at the family mansion,--"I see the Duke's carriage in motion; I presume your ladyship
will take your right of rank in leaving the field. May I be permitted to convoy your ladyship
and Miss Bellenden home?--Parties of the wild whigs have been abroad, and are said to insult
and disarm the well-affected who travel in small numbers."

"We thank you, cousin Gilbertscleugh," said Lady Margaret; "but as we shall have the escort
of my own people, I trust we have less need than others to be troublesome to our friends. Will
you have the goodness to order Harrison to bring up our people somewhat more briskly; he rides
them towards us as if he were leading a funeral procession."

The gentleman in attendance communicated his lady's orders to the trusty steward.

Honest Harrison had his own reasons for doubting the prudence of this command; but, once issued
and received, there was a necessity for obeying it. He set off, therefore, at a hand-gallop,
followed by the butler, in such a military attitude as became one who had served under Montrose,
and with a look of defiance, rendered sterner and fiercer by the inspiring fumes of a gill
of brandy, which he had snatched a moment to bolt to the king's health, and confusion to the
Covenant, during the intervals of military duty. Unhappily this potent refreshment wiped away
from the tablets of his memory the necessity of paying some attention to the distresses and
difficulties of his rear-file, Goose Gibbie. No sooner had the horses struck a canter, than
Gibbie's jack-boots, which the poor boy's legs were incapable of steadying, began to play alternately
against the horse's flanks, and, being armed with long-rowelled spurs, overcame the patience
of the animal, which bounced and plunged, while poor Gibbie's entreaties for aid never reached
the ears of the too heedless butler, being drowned partly in the concave of the steel cap in
which his head was immersed, and partly in the martial tune of the Gallant Grames, which Mr
Gudyill whistled with all his power of lungs.

The upshot was, that the steed speedily took the matter into his own hands, and having gambolled
hither and thither to the great amusement of all spectators, set off at full speed towards
the huge family-coach already described. Gibbie's pike, escaping from its sling, had fallen
to a level direction across his hands, which, I grieve to say, were seeking dishonourable safety
in as strong a grasp of the mane as their muscles could manage. His casque, too, had slipped
completely over his face, so that he saw as little in front as he did in rear. Indeed, if he
could, it would have availed him little in the circumstances; for his horse, as if in league
with the disaffected, ran full tilt towards the solemn equipage of the Duke, which the projecting
lance threatened to perforate from window to window, at the risk of transfixing as many in
its passage as the celebrated thrust of Orlando, which, according to the Italian epic poet,
broached as many Moors as a Frenchman spits frogs.

On beholding the bent of this misdirected career, a panic shout of mingled terror and wrath
was set up by the whole equipage, insides and outsides, at once, which had the happy effect
of averting the threatened misfortune. The capricious horse of Goose Gibbie was terrified by
the noise, and stumbling as he turned short round, kicked and plunged violently as soon as
he recovered. The jack-boots, the original cause of the disaster, maintaining the reputation
they had acquired when worn by better cavaliers, answered every plunge by a fresh prick of
the spurs, and, by their ponderous weight, kept their place in the stirrups. Not so Goose Gibbie,
who was fairly spurned out of those wide and ponderous greaves, and precipitated over the horse's
head, to the infinite amusement of all the spectators. His lance and helmet had forsaken him
in his fall, and, for the completion of his disgrace, Lady Margaret Bellenden, not perfectly
aware that it was one of her warriors who was furnishing so much entertainment, came up in
time to see her diminutive man-at-arms stripped of his lion's hide,--of the buff-coat, that
is, in which he was muffled.

As she had not been made acquainted with this metamorphosis, and could not even guess its cause,
her surprise and resentment were extreme, nor were they much modified by the excuses and explanations
of her steward and butler. She made a hasty retreat homeward, extremely indignant at the shouts
and laughter of the company, and much disposed to vent her displeasure on the refractory agriculturist
whose place Goose Gibbie had so unhappily supplied. The greater part of the gentry now dispersed,
the whimsical misfortune which had befallen the gens d'armerie of Tillietudlem furnishing them
with huge entertainment on their road homeward. The horsemen also, in little parties, as their
road lay together, diverged from the place of rendezvous, excepting such as, having tried their
dexterity at the popinjay, were, by ancient custom, obliged to partake of a grace-cup with
their captain before their departure.

CHAPTER IV.

          At fairs he play'd before the spearmen,
          And gaily graithed in their gear then,
          Steel bonnets, pikes, and swords shone clear then
          As ony bead;  Now wha sall play before sic weir men,
                    Since Habbie's dead!
                                        Elegy on Habbie Simpson.

The cavalcade of horsemen on their road to the little borough-town were preceded by Niel Blane,
the town-piper, mounted on his white galloway, armed with his dirk and broadsword, and bearing
a chanter streaming with as many ribbons as would deck out six country belles for a fair or
preaching. Niel, a clean, tight, well-timbered, long-winded fellow, had gained the official
situation of town-piper of--by his merit, with all the emoluments thereof; namely, the Piper's
Croft, as it is still called, a field of about an acre in extent, five merks, and a new livery-coat
of the town's colours, yearly; some hopes of a dollar upon the day of the election of magistrates,
providing the provost were able and willing to afford such a gratuity; and the privilege of
paying, at all the respectable houses in the neighbourhood, an annual visit at spring-time,
to rejoice their hearts with his music, to comfort his own with their ale and brandy, and to
beg from each a modicum of seed-corn.

In addition to these inestimable advantages, Niel's personal, or professional, accomplishments
won the heart of a jolly widow, who then kept the principal change-house in the borough. Her
former husband having been a strict presbyterian, of such note that he usually went among his
sect by the name of Gaius the publican, many of the more rigid were scandalized by the profession
of the successor whom his relict had chosen for a second helpmate. As the browst (or brewing)
of the Howff retained, nevertheless, its unrivalled reputation, most of the old customers continued
to give it a preference. The character of the new landlord, indeed, was of that accommodating
kind, which enabled him, by close attention to the helm, to keep his little vessel pretty steady
amid the contending tides of faction. He was a good-humoured, shrewd, selfish sort of fellow,
indifferent alike to the disputes about church and state, and only anxious to secure the good-will
of customers of every description. But his character, as well as the state of the country,
will be best understood by giving the reader an account of the instructions which he issued
to his daughter, a girl about eighteen, whom he was initiating in those cares which had been
faithfully discharged by his wife, until about six months before our story commences, when
the honest woman had been carried to the kirkyard.

"Jenny," said Niel Blane, as the girl assisted to disencumber him of his bagpipes, "this is
the first day that ye are to take the place of your worthy mother in attending to the public;
a douce woman she was, civil to the customers, and had a good name wi' Whig and Tory, baith
up the street and down the street. It will be hard for you to fill her place, especially on
sic a thrang day as this; but Heaven's will maun be obeyed.--Jenny, whatever Milnwood ca's
for, be sure he maun hae't, for he's the Captain o' the Popinjay, and auld customs maun be
supported; if he canna pay the lawing himsell, as I ken he's keepit unco short by the head,
I'll find a way to shame it out o' his uncle.--The curate is playing at dice wi' Cornet Grahame.
Be eident and civil to them baith--clergy and captains can gie an unco deal o' fash in thae
times, where they take an ill-will.--The dragoons will be crying for ale, and they wunna want
it, and maunna want it--they are unruly chields, but they pay ane some gate or other. I gat
the humle-cow, that's the best in the byre, frae black Frank Inglis and Sergeant Bothwell,
for ten pund Scots, and they drank out the price at ae downsitting."

"But, father," interrupted Jenny, "they say the twa reiving loons drave the cow frae the gudewife
o' Bell's-moor, just because she gaed to hear a field-preaching ae Sabbath afternoon."

"Whisht! ye silly tawpie," said her father, "we have naething to do how they come by the bestial
they sell--be that atween them and their consciences.--Aweel--Take notice, Jenny, of that dour,
stour-looking carle that sits by the cheek o' the ingle, and turns his back on a' men. He looks
like ane o' the hill-folk, for I saw him start a wee when he saw the red-coats, and I jalouse
he wad hae liked to hae ridden by, but his horse (it's a gude gelding) was ower sair travailed;
he behoved to stop whether he wad or no. Serve him cannily, Jenny, and wi' little din, and
dinna bring the sodgers on him by speering ony questions at him; but let na him hae a room
to himsell, they wad say we were hiding him.--For yoursell, Jenny, ye'll be civil to a' the
folk, and take nae heed o' ony nonsense and daffing the young lads may say t'ye. Folk in the
hostler line maun put up wi' muckle. Your mither, rest her saul, could pit up wi' as muckle
as maist women--but aff hands is fair play; and if ony body be uncivil ye may gie me a cry--Aweel,--when
the malt begins to get aboon the meal, they'll begin to speak about government in kirk and
state, and then, Jenny, they are like to quarrel--let them be doing--anger's a drouthy passion,
and the mair they dispute, the mair ale they'll drink; but ye were best serve them wi' a pint
o' the sma' browst, it will heat them less, and they'll never ken the difference."

"But, father," said Jenny, "if they come to lounder ilk ither, as they did last time, suldna
I cry on you?"

"At no hand, Jenny; the redder gets aye the warst lick in the fray. If the sodgers draw their
swords, ye'll cry on the corporal and the guard. If the country folk tak the tangs and poker,
ye'll cry on the bailie and town-officers. But in nae event cry on me, for I am wearied wi'
doudling the bag o' wind a' day, and I am gaun to eat my dinner quietly in the spence.--And,
now I think on't, the Laird of Lickitup (that's him that was the laird) was speering for sma'
drink and a saut herring--gie him a pu' be the sleeve, and round into his lug I wad be blithe
o' his company to dine wi' me; he was a gude customer anes in a day, and wants naething but
means to be a gude ane again--he likes drink as weel as e'er he did. And if ye ken ony puir
body o' our acquaintance that's blate for want o' siller, and has far to gang hame, ye needna
stick to gie them a waught o' drink and a bannock--we'll ne'er miss't, and it looks creditable
in a house like ours. And now, hinny, gang awa', and serve the folk, but first bring me my
dinner, and twa chappins o' yill and the mutchkin stoup o' brandy."

Having thus devolved his whole cares on Jenny as prime minister, Niel Blane and the ci-devant
laird, once his patron, but now glad to be his trencher-companion, sate down to enjoy themselves
for the remainder of the evening, remote from the bustle of the public room.

All in Jenny's department was in full activity. The knights of the popinjay received and requited
the hospitable entertainment of their captain, who, though he spared the cup himself, took
care it should go round with due celerity among the rest, who might not have otherwise deemed
themselves handsomely treated. Their numbers melted away by degrees, and were at length diminished
to four or five, who began to talk of breaking up their party. At another table, at some distance,
sat two of the dragoons, whom Niel Blane had mentioned, a sergeant and a private in the celebrated
John Grahame of Claverhouse's regiment of Life-Guards. Even the non-commissioned officers and
privates in these corps were not considered as ordinary mercenaries, but rather approached
to the rank of the French mousquetaires, being regarded in the light of cadets, who performed
the duties of rank-and-file with the prospect of obtaining commissions in case of distinguishing
themselves.

Many young men of good families were to be found in the ranks, a circumstance which added to
the pride and self-consequence of these troops. A remarkable instance of this occurred in the
person of the non-commissioned officer in question. His real name was Francis Stewart, but
he was universally known by the appellation of Bothwell, being lineally descended from the
last earl of that name; not the infamous lover of the unfortunate Queen Mary, but Francis Stewart,
Earl of Bothwell, whose turbulence and repeated conspiracies embarrassed the early part of
James Sixth's reign, and who at length died in exile in great poverty. The son of this Earl
had sued to Charles I. for the restitution of part of his father's forfeited estates, but the
grasp of the nobles to whom they had been allotted was too tenacious to be unclenched. The
breaking out of the civil wars utterly ruined him, by intercepting a small pension which Charles
I. had allowed him, and he died in the utmost indigence. His son, after having served as a
soldier abroad and in Britain, and passed through several vicissitudes of fortune, was fain
to content himself with the situation of a non-commissioned officer in the Life-Guards, although
lineally descended from the royal family, the father of the forfeited Earl of Bothwell having
been a natural son of James VI.

     [Note: Sergeant Bothwell. The history of the restless and ambitious
     Francis Stewart, Earl of Bothwell, makes a considerable figure in
     the reign of James VI. of Scotland, and First of England. After
     being repeatedly pardoned for acts of treason, he was at length
     obliged to retire abroad, where he died in great misery. Great part
     of his forfeited estate was bestowed on Walter Scott, first Lord of
     Buccleuch, and on the first Earl of Roxburghe.

     Francis Stewart, son of the forfeited Earl, obtained from the favour
     of Charles I. a decreet-arbitral, appointing the two noblemen,
     grantees of his father's estate, to restore the same, or make some
     compensation for retaining it. The barony of Crichton, with its
     beautiful castle, was surrendered by the curators of Francis, Earl
     of Buccleuch, but he retained the far more extensive property in
     Liddesdale. James Stewart also, as appears from writings in the
     author's possession, made an advantageous composition with the Earl
     of Roxburghe. "But," says the satirical Scotstarvet, "male parta
     pejus dilabuntur;" for he never brooked them, (enjoyed them,) nor was
     any thing the richer, since they accrued to his creditors, and are
     now in the possession of Dr Seaton. His eldest son Francis became a
     trooper in the late war; as for the other brother John, who was
     Abbot of Coldingham, he also disposed all that estate, and now has
     nothing, but lives on the charity of his friends. "The Staggering
     State of the Scots Statesmen for One Hundred Years," by Sir John
     Scot of Scotstarvet. Edinburgh, 1754. P. 154.

     Francis Stewart, who had been a trooper during the great Civil War,
     seems to have received no preferment, after the Restoration, suited
     to his high birth, though, in fact, third cousin to Charles II.
     Captain Crichton, the friend of Dean Swift, who published his
     Memoirs, found him a private gentleman in the King's Life-Guards. At
     the same time this was no degrading condition; for Fountainhall
     records a duel fought between a Life-Guardsman and an officer in the
     militia, because the latter had taken upon him to assume superior
     rank as an officer, to a gentleman private in the Life-Guards. The
     Life-Guards man was killed in the rencontre, and his antagonist was
     executed for murder.

     The character of Bothwell, except in relation to the name, is
     entirely ideal.]

Great personal strength, and dexterity in the use of his arms, as well as the remarkable circumstances
of his descent, had recommended this man to the attention of his officers. But he partook in
a great degree of the licentiousness and oppressive disposition, which the habit of acting
as agents for government in levying fines, exacting free quarters, and otherwise oppressing
the Presbyterian recusants, had rendered too general among these soldiers. They were so much
accustomed to such missions, that they conceived themselves at liberty to commit all manner
of license with impunity, as if totally exempted from all law and authority, excepting the
command of their officers. On such occasions Bothwell was usually the most forward.

It is probable that Bothwell and his companions would not so long have remained quiet, but
for respect to the presence of their Cornet, who commanded the small party quartered in the
borough, and who was engaged in a game at dice with the curate of the place. But both of these
being suddenly called from their amusement to speak with the chief magistrate upon some urgent
business, Bothwell was not long of evincing his contempt for the rest of the company.

"Is it not a strange thing, Halliday," he said to his comrade, "to see a set of bumpkins sit
carousing here this whole evening, without having drank the king's health?"

"They have drank the king's health," said Halliday. "I heard that green kail-worm of a lad
name his majesty's health."

"Did he?" said Bothwell. "Then, Tom, we'll have them drink the Archbishop of St Andrew's health,
and do it on their knees too."

"So we will, by G--," said Halliday; "and he that refuses it, we'll have him to the guard-house,
and teach him to ride the colt foaled of an acorn, with a brace of carabines at each foot to
keep him steady."

"Right, Tom," continued Bothwell; "and, to do all things in order, I'll begin with that sulky
blue-bonnet in the ingle-nook."

He rose accordingly, and taking his sheathed broadsword under his arm to support the insolence
which he meditated, placed himself in front of the stranger noticed by Niel Blane, in his admonitions
to his daughter, as being, in all probability, one of the hill-folk, or refractory presbyterians.

"I make so bold as to request of your precision, beloved," said the trooper, in a tone of affected
solemnity, and assuming the snuffle of a country preacher, "that you will arise from your seat,
beloved, and, having bent your hams until your knees do rest upon the floor, beloved, that
you will turn over this measure (called by the profane a gill) of the comfortable creature,
which the carnal denominate brandy, to the health and glorification of his Grace the Archbishop
of St Andrews, the worthy primate of all Scotland."

All waited for the stranger's answer.--His features, austere even to ferocity, with a cast
of eye, which, without being actually oblique, approached nearly to a squint, and which gave
a very sinister expression to his countenance, joined to a frame, square, strong, and muscular,
though something under the middle size, seemed to announce a man unlikely to understand rude
jesting, or to receive insults with impunity.

"And what is the consequence," said he, "if I should not be disposed to comply with your uncivil
request?"

"The consequence thereof, beloved," said Bothwell, in the same tone of raillery, "will be,
firstly, that I will tweak thy proboscis or nose. Secondly, beloved, that I will administer
my fist to thy distorted visual optics; and will conclude, beloved, with a practical application
of the flat of my sword to the shoulders of the recusant."

"Is it even so?" said the stranger; "then give me the cup;" and, taking it in his hand, he
said, with a peculiar expression of voice and manner, "The Archbishop of St Andrews, and the
place he now worthily holds;--may each prelate in Scotland soon be as the Right Reverend James
Sharpe!"

"He has taken the test," said Halliday, exultingly.

"But with a qualification," said Bothwell; "I don't understand what the devil the crop-eared
whig means."

"Come, gentlemen," said Morton, who became impatient of their insolence, "we are here met as
good subjects, and on a merry occasion; and we have a right to expect we shall not be troubled
with this sort of discussion."

Bothwell was about to make a surly answer, but Halliday reminded him in a whisper, that there
were strict injunctions that the soldiers should give no offence to the men who were sent out
to the musters agreeably to the council's orders. So, after honouring Morton with a broad and
fierce stare, he said, "Well, Mr Popinjay, I shall not disturb your reign; I reckon it will
be out by twelve at night.--Is it not an odd thing, Halliday," he continued, addressing his
companion, "that they should make such a fuss about cracking off their birding-pieces at a
mark which any woman or boy could hit at a day's practice? If Captain Popinjay now, or any
of his troop, would try a bout, either with the broadsword, backsword, single rapier, or rapier
and dagger, for a gold noble, the first-drawn blood, there would be some soul in it,--or, zounds,
would the bumpkins but wrestle, or pitch the bar, or putt the stone, or throw the axle-tree,
if (touching the end of Morton's sword scornfully with his toe) they carry things about them
that they are afraid to draw."

Morton's patience and prudence now gave way entirely, and he was about to make a very angry
answer to Bothwell's insolent observations, when the stranger stepped forward.

"This is my quarrel," he said, "and in the name of the good cause, I will see it out myself.--Hark
thee, friend," (to Bothwell,) "wilt thou wrestle a fall with me?"

"With my whole spirit, beloved," answered Bothwell; "yea I will strive with thee, to the downfall
of one or both."

"Then, as my trust is in Him that can help," retorted his antagonist, "I will forthwith make
thee an example to all such railing Rabshakehs"

With that he dropped his coarse grey horseman's coat from his shoulders, and, extending his
strong brawny arms with a look of determined resolution, he offered himself to the contest.
The soldier was nothing abashed by the muscular frame, broad chest, square shoulders, and hardy
look of his antagonist, but, whistling with great composure, unbuckled his belt, and laid aside
his military coat. The company stood round them, anxious for the event.

In the first struggle the trooper seemed to have some advantage, and also in the second, though
neither could be considered as decisive. But it was plain he had put his whole strength too
suddenly forth, against an antagonist possessed of great endurance, skill, vigour, and length
of wind. In the third close, the countryman lifted his opponent fairly from the floor, and
hurled him to the ground with such violence, that he lay for an instant stunned and motionless.
His comrade Halliday immediately drew his sword; "You have killed my sergeant," he exclaimed
to the victorious wrestler, "and by all that is sacred you shall answer it!"

"Stand back!" cried Morton and his companions, "it was all fair play; your comrade sought a
fall, and he has got it."

"That is true enough," said Bothwell, as he slowly rose; "put up your bilbo, Tom. I did not
think there was a crop-ear of them all could have laid the best cap and feather in the King's
Life-Guards on the floor of a rascally change-house.--Hark ye, friend, give me your hand."
The stranger held out his hand. "I promise you," said Bothwell, squeezing his hand very hard,
"that the time will come when we shall meet again, and try this game over in a more earnest
manner."

"And I'll promise you," said the stranger, returning the grasp with equal firmness, "that when
we next meet, I will lay your head as low as it lay even now, when you shall lack the power
to lift it up again."

"Well, beloved," answered Bothwell, "if thou be'st a whig, thou art a stout and a brave one,
and so good even to thee--Hadst best take thy nag before the Cornet makes the round; for, I
promise thee, he has stay'd less suspicious-looking persons."

The stranger seemed to think that the hint was not to be neglected; he flung down his reckoning,
and going into the stable, saddled and brought out a powerful black horse, now recruited by
rest and forage, and turning to Morton, observed, "I ride towards Milnwood, which I hear is
your home; will you give me the advantage and protection of your company?"

"Certainly," said Morton; although there was something of gloomy and relentless severity in
the man's manner from which his mind recoiled. His companions, after a courteous good-night,
broke up and went off in different directions, some keeping them company for about a mile,
until they dropped off one by one, and the travellers were left alone.

The company had not long left the Howff, as Blane's public-house was called, when the trumpets
and kettle-drums sounded. The troopers got under arms in the market-place at this unexpected
summons, while, with faces of anxiety and earnestness, Cornet Grahame, a kinsman of Claverhouse,
and the Provost of the borough, followed by half-a-dozen soldiers, and town-officers with halberts,
entered the apartment of Niel Blane.

"Guard the doors!" were the first words which the Cornet spoke; "let no man leave the house.--So,
Bothwell, how comes this? Did you not hear them sound boot and saddle?"

"He was just going to quarters, sir," said his comrade; "he has had a bad fall."

"In a fray, I suppose?" said Grahame. "If you neglect duty in this way, your royal blood will
hardly protect you."

"How have I neglected duty?" said Bothwell, sulkily.

"You should have been at quarters, Sergeant Bothwell," replied the officer; "you have lost
a golden opportunity. Here are news come that the Archbishop of St Andrews has been strangely
and foully assassinated by a body of the rebel whigs, who pursued and stopped his carriage
on Magus-Muir, near the town of St Andrews, dragged him out, and dispatched him with their
swords and daggers." [Note: The general account of this act of assassination is to be found
in all histories of the period. A more particular narrative may be found in the words of one
of the actors, James Russell, in the Appendix to Kirkton's History of the Church of Scotland,
published by Charles Kirkpatrick Sharpe, Esquire. 4to, Edinburgh, 1817.]

All stood aghast at the intelligence.

"Here are their descriptions," continued the Cornet, pulling out a proclamation, "the reward
of a thousand merks is on each of their heads."

"The test, the test, and the qualification!" said Bothwell to Halliday; "I know the meaning
now--Zounds, that we should not have stopt him! Go saddle our horses, Halliday.--Was there
one of the men, Cornet, very stout and square-made, double-chested, thin in the flanks, hawk-nosed?"

"Stay, stay," said Cornet Grahame, "let me look at the paper.--Hackston of Rathillet, tall,
thin, black-haired."

"That is not my man," said Bothwell.

"John Balfour, called Burley, aquiline nose, red-haired, five feet eight inches in height"--"It
is he--it is the very man!" said Bothwell,--"skellies fearfully with one eye?"

"Right," continued Grahame, "rode a strong black horse, taken from the primate at the time
of the murder."

"The very man," exclaimed Bothwell, "and the very horse! he was in this room not a quarter
of an hour since."

A few hasty enquiries tended still more to confirm the opinion, that the reserved and stern
stranger was Balfour of Burley, the actual commander of the band of assassins, who, in the
fury of misguided zeal, had murdered the primate, whom they accidentally met, as they were
searching for another person against whom they bore enmity. [Note: One Carmichael, sheriff-depute
in Fife, who had been active in enforcing the penal measures against non-conformists. He was
on the moors hunting, but receiving accidental information that a party was out in quest of
him, he returned home, and escaped the fate designed for him, which befell his patron the Archbishop.]
In their excited imagination the casual rencounter had the appearance of a providential interference,
and they put to death the archbishop, with circumstances of great and cold-blooded cruelty,
under the belief, that the Lord, as they expressed it, had delivered him into their hands.

     [Note:  Murderers of Archbishop Sharpe. The leader of this party was
     David Hackston, of Rathillet, a gentleman of ancient birth and good
     estate. He had been profligate in his younger days, but having been
     led from curiosity to attend the conventicles of the nonconforming
     clergy, he adopted their principles in the fullest extent. It
     appears, that Hackston had some personal quarrel with Archbishop
     Sharpe, which induced him to decline the command of the party when
     the slaughter was determined upon, fearing his acceptance might be
     ascribed to motives of personal enmity. He felt himself free in
     conscience, however, to be present; and when the archbishop, dragged
     from his carriage, crawled towards him on his knees for protection,
     he replied coldly, "Sir, I will never lay a finger on you." It is
     remarkable that Hackston, as well as a shepherd who was also
     present, but passive, on the occasion, were the only two of the
     party of assassins who suffered death by the hands of the
     executioner.

     On Hackston refusing the command, it was by universal suffrage
     conferred on John Balfour of Kinloch, called Burley, who was
     Hackston's brother-in-law. He is described "as a little man,
     squint-eyed, and of a very fierce aspect."--"He was," adds the same
     author, "by some reckoned none of the most religious; yet he was
     always reckoned zealous and honest-hearted, courageous in every
     enterprise, and a brave soldier, seldom any escaping that came into
     his hands. He was the principal actor in killing that arch-traitor
     to the Lord and his church, James Sharpe." See Scottish Worthies.
     8vo. Leith, 1816. Page 522.]

"Horse, horse, and pursue, my lads!" exclaimed Cornet Grahame; "the murdering dog's head is
worth its weight in gold."

CHAPTER V.

               Arouse thee, youth!--it is no human call--
               God's church is leaguer'd--haste to man the wall;
               Haste where the Redcross banners wave on high,
               Signal of honour'd death, or victory!

Morton and his companion had attained some distance from the town before either of them addressed
the other. There was something, as we have observed, repulsive in the manner of the stranger,
which prevented Morton from opening the conversation, and he himself seemed to have no desire
to talk, until, on a sudden, he abruptly demanded, "What has your father's son to do with such
profane mummeries as I find you this day engaged in?"

"I do my duty as a subject, and pursue my harmless recreations according to my own pleasure,"
replied Morton, somewhat offended.

"Is it your duty, think you, or that of any Christian young man, to bear arms in their cause
who have poured out the blood of God's saints in the wilderness as if it had been water? or
is it a lawful recreation to waste time in shooting at a bunch of feathers, and close your
evening with winebibbing in public-houses and market-towns, when He that is mighty is come
into the land with his fan in his hand, to purge the wheat from the chaff?"

"I suppose from your style of conversation," said Morton, "that you are one of those who have
thought proper to stand out against the government. I must remind you that you are unnecessarily
using dangerous language in the presence of a mere stranger, and that the times do not render
it safe for me to listen to it."

"Thou canst not help it, Henry Morton," said his companion; "thy Master has his uses for thee,
and when he calls, thou must obey. Well wot I thou hast not heard the call of a true preacher,
or thou hadst ere now been what thou wilt assuredly one day become."

"We are of the presbyterian persuasion, like yourself," said Morton; for his uncle's family
attended the ministry of one of those numerous presbyterian clergymen, who, complying with
certain regulations, were licensed to preach without interruption from the government. This
indulgence, as it was called, made a great schism among the presbyterians, and those who accepted
of it were severely censured by the more rigid sectaries, who refused the proffered terms.
The stranger, therefore, answered with great disdain to Morton's profession of faith.

"That is but an equivocation--a poor equivocation. Ye listen on the Sabbath to a cold, worldly,
time-serving discourse, from one who forgets his high commission so much as to hold his apostleship
by the favour of the courtiers and the false prelates, and ye call that hearing the word! Of
all the baits with which the devil has fished for souls in these days of blood and darkness,
that Black Indulgence has been the most destructive. An awful dispensation it has been, a smiting
of the shepherd and a scattering of the sheep upon the mountains--an uplifting of one Christian
banner against another, and a fighting of the wars of darkness with the swords of the children
of light!"

"My uncle," said Morton, "is of opinion, that we enjoy a reasonable freedom of conscience under
the indulged clergymen, and I must necessarily be guided by his sentiments respecting the choice
of a place of worship for his family."

"Your uncle," said the horseman, "is one of those to whom the least lamb in his own folds at
Milnwood is dearer than the whole Christian flock. He is one that could willingly bend down
to the golden-calf of Bethel, and would have fished for the dust thereof when it was ground
to powder and cast upon the waters. Thy father was a man of another stamp."

"My father," replied Morton, "was indeed a brave and gallant man. And you may have heard, sir,
that he fought for that royal family in whose name I was this day carrying arms."

"Ay; and had he lived to see these days, he would have cursed the hour he ever drew sword in
their cause. But more of this hereafter--I promise thee full surely that thy hour will come,
and then the words thou hast now heard will stick in thy bosom like barbed arrows. My road
lies there."

He pointed towards a pass leading up into a wild extent of dreary and desolate hills; but as
he was about to turn his horse's head into the rugged path, which led from the high-road in
that direction, an old woman wrapped in a red cloak, who was sitting by the cross-way, arose,
and approaching him, said, in a mysterious tone of voice, "If ye be of our ain folk, gangna
up the pass the night for your lives. There is a lion in the path, that is there. The curate
of Brotherstane and ten soldiers hae beset the pass, to hae the lives of ony of our puir wanderers
that venture that gate to join wi' Hamilton and Dingwall."

"Have the persecuted folk drawn to any head among themselves?" demanded the stranger.

"About sixty or seventy horse and foot," said the old dame; "but, ewhow! they are puirly armed,
and warse fended wi' victual."

"God will help his own," said the horseman. "Which way shall I take to join them?"

"It's a mere impossibility this night," said the woman, "the troopers keep sae strict a guard;
and they say there's strange news come frae the east, that makes them rage in their cruelty
mair fierce than ever--Ye maun take shelter somegate for the night before ye get to the muirs,
and keep yoursell in hiding till the grey o' the morning, and then you may find your way through
the Drake Moss. When I heard the awfu' threatenings o' the oppressors, I e'en took my cloak
about me, and sate down by the wayside, to warn ony of our puir scattered remnant that chanced
to come this gate, before they fell into the nets of the spoilers."

"Have you a house near this?" said the stranger; "and can you give me hiding there?"

"I have," said the old woman, "a hut by the way-side, it may be a mile from hence; but four
men of Belial, called dragoons, are lodged therein, to spoil my household goods at their pleasure,
because I will not wait upon the thowless, thriftless, fissenless ministry of that carnal man,
John Halftext, the curate."

"Good night, good woman, and thanks for thy counsel," said the stranger, as he rode away.

"The blessings of the promise upon you," returned the old dame; "may He keep you that can keep
you."

"Amen!" said the traveller; "for where to hide my head this night, mortal skill cannot direct me."

"I am very sorry for your distress," said Morton; "and had I a house or place of shelter that
could be called my own, I almost think I would risk the utmost rigour of the law rather than
leave you in such a strait. But my uncle is so alarmed at the pains and penalties denounced
by the laws against such as comfort, receive, or consort with intercommuned persons, that he
has strictly forbidden all of us to hold any intercourse with them."

"It is no less than I expected," said the stranger; "nevertheless, I might be received without
his knowledge;--a barn, a hay-loft, a cart-shed,--any place where I could stretch me down,
would be to my habits like a tabernacle of silver set about with planks of cedar."

"I assure you," said Morton, much embarrassed, "that I have not the means of receiving you
at Milnwood without my uncle's consent and knowledge; nor, if I could do so, would I think
myself justifiable in engaging him unconsciously in danger, which, most of all others, he fears
and deprecates."

"Well," said the traveller, "I have but one word to say. Did you ever hear your father mention
John Balfour of Burley?"

"His ancient friend and comrade, who saved his life, with almost the loss of his own, in the
battle of Longmarston-Moor?--Often, very often."

"I am that Balfour," said his companion. "Yonder stands thy uncle's house; I see the light
among the trees. The avenger of blood is behind me, and my death certain unless I have refuge
there. Now, make thy choice, young man; to shrink from the side of thy father's friend, like
a thief in the night, and to leave him exposed to the bloody death from which he rescued thy
father, or to expose thine uncle's wordly goods to such peril, as, in this perverse generation,
attends those who give a morsel of bread or a draught of cold water to a Christian man, when
perishing for lack of refreshment!"

A thousand recollections thronged on the mind of Morton at once. His father, whose memory he
idolized, had often enlarged upon his obligations to this man, and regretted, that, after having
been long comrades, they had parted in some unkindness at the time when the kingdom of Scotland
was divided into Resolutioners and Protesters; the former of whom adhered to Charles II. after
his father's death upon the scaffold, while the Protesters inclined rather to a union with
the triumphant republicans. The stern fanaticism of Burley had attached him to this latter
party, and the comrades had parted in displeasure, never, as it happened, to meet again. These
circumstances the deceased Colonel Morton had often mentioned to his son, and always with an
expression of deep regret, that he had never, in any manner, been enabled to repay the assistance,
which, on more than one occasion, he had received from Burley.

To hasten Morton's decision, the night-wind, as it swept along, brought from a distance the
sullen sound of a kettle-drum, which, seeming to approach nearer, intimated that a body of
horse were upon their march towards them.

"It must be Claverhouse, with the rest of his regiment. What can have occasioned this night-march?
If you go on, you fall into their hands--if you turn back towards the borough-town, you are
in no less danger from Cornet Grahame's party.--The path to the hill is beset. I must shelter
you at Milnwood, or expose you to instant death;--but the punishment of the law shall fall
upon myself, as in justice it should, not upon my uncle.--Follow me."

Burley, who had awaited his resolution with great composure, now followed him in silence.

The house of Milnwood, built by the father of the present proprietor, was a decent mansion,
suitable to the size of the estate, but, since the accession of this owner, it had been suffered
to go considerably into disrepair. At some little distance from the house stood the court of
offices. Here Morton paused.

"I must leave you here for a little while," he whispered, "until I can provide a bed for you
in the house."

"I care little for such delicacy," said Burley; "for thirty years this head has rested oftener
on the turf, or on the next grey stone, than upon either wool or down. A draught of ale, a
morsel of bread, to say my prayers, and to stretch me upon dry hay, were to me as good as a
painted chamber and a prince's table."

It occurred to Morton at the same moment, that to attempt to introduce the fugitive within
the house, would materially increase the danger of detection. Accordingly, having struck a
light with implements left in the stable for that purpose, and having fastened up their horses,
he assigned Burley, for his place of repose, a wooden bed, placed in a loft half-full of hay,
which an out-of-door domestic had occupied until dismissed by his uncle in one of those fits
of parsimony which became more rigid from day to day. In this untenanted loft Morton left his
companion, with a caution so to shade his light that no reflection might be seen from the window,
and a promise that he would presently return with such refreshments as he might be able to
procure at that late hour. Eh it is a firehouse, but has the seven foot and your o, as you do about have

 Do ye think we havena heard o' your

nae doubt, wi' a' the scaff and raff o' the water-side, till sun-down, and then coming hame
and crying for ale, as if ye were maister and mair!"

Extremely vexed, yet anxious, on account of his guest, to procure refreshments if possible,
Morton suppressed his resentment, and good-humouredly assured Mrs Wilson, that he was really
both hungry and thirsty; "and as for the shooting at the popinjay, I have heard you say you
have been there yourself, Mrs Wilson--I wish you had come to look at us."

"Ah, Maister Henry," said the old dame, "I wish ye binna beginning to learn the way of blawing
in a woman's lug wi' a' your whilly-wha's!-- Aweel, sae ye dinna practise them but on auld
wives like me, the less matter. But tak heed o' the young queans, lad.--Popinjay--ye think
yoursell a braw fellow enow; and troth!" (surveying him with the candle,) "there's nae fault
to find wi' the outside, if the inside be conforming. But I mind, when I was a gilpy of a lassock,
seeing the Duke, that was him that lost his head at London--folk said it wasna a very gude

cared to win it ower his Grace's head--weel, he had a comely presence, and when a' the gentles
mounted to show their capers, his Grace was as near to me as I am to you; and he said to me,
'Tak tent o' yoursell, my bonny lassie, (these were his very words,) for my horse is not very
chancy.'--And now, as ye say ye had sae little to eat or drink, I'll let you see that I havena
been sae unmindfu' o' you; for I dinna think it's safe for young folk to gang to their bed
on an empty stamach."

To do Mrs Wilson justice, her nocturnal harangues upon such occasions not unfrequently terminated
with this sage apophthegm, which always prefaced the producing of some provision a little better
than ordinary, such as she now placed before him. In fact, the principal object of her maundering
was to display her consequence and love of power; for Mrs Wilson was not, at the bottom, an
illtempered woman, and certainly loved her old and young master (both of whom she tormented
extremely) better than any one else in the world. She now eyed Mr Henry, as she called him,
with great complacency, as he partook of her good cheer.

"Muckle gude may it do ye, my bonny man. I trow ye dinna get sic a skirl-in-the-pan as that
at Niel Blane's. His wife was a canny body, and could dress things very weel for ane in her
line o' business, but no like a gentleman's housekeeper, to be sure. But I doubt the daughter's
a silly thing--an unco cockernony she had busked on her head at the kirk last Sunday. I am
doubting that there will be news o' a' thae braws. But my auld een's drawing thegither--dinna
hurry yoursell, my bonny man, tak mind about the putting out the candle, and there's a horn
of ale, and a glass of clow-gillie-flower water; I dinna gie ilka body that; I keep it for
a pain I hae whiles in my ain stamach, and it's better for your young blood than brandy. Sae,
gude-night to ye, Mr Henry, and see that ye tak gude care o' the candle."

Morton promised to attend punctually to her caution, and requested her not to be alarmed if
she heard the door opened, as she knew he must again, as usual, look to his horse, and arrange
him for the night. Mrs Wilson then retreated, and Morton, folding up his provisions, was about
to hasten to his guest, when the nodding head of the old housekeeper was again thrust in at
the door, with an admonition, to remember to take an account of his ways before he laid himself
down to rest, and to pray for protection during the hours of darkness.

Such were the manners of a certain class of domestics, once common in Scotland, and perhaps
still to be found in some old manor-houses in its remote counties. They were fixtures in the
family they belonged to; and as they never conceived the possibility of such a thing as dismissal
to be within the chances of their lives, they were, of course, sincerely attached to every
member of it. [Note: A masculine retainer of this kind, having offended his master extremely,
was commanded to leave his service instantly. "In troth and that will I not," answered the
domestic; "if your honour disna ken when ye hae a gude servant, I ken when I hae a gude master,
and go away I will not." On another occasion of the same nature, the master said, "John, you
and I shall never sleep under the same roof again;" to which John replied, with much, "Whare
the deil can your honour be ganging?"] On the other hand, when spoiled by the indulgence or
indolence of their superiors, they were very apt to become ill-tempered, self-sufficient, and
tyrannical; so much so, that a mistress or master would sometimes almost have wished to exchange
their crossgrained fidelity for the smooth and accommodating duplicity of a modern menial.

CHAPTER VI.

               Yea, this man's brow, like to a tragic leaf,
               Foretells the nature of a tragic volume.
                                                  Shakspeare.

Being at length rid of the housekeeper's presence, Morton made a collection of what he had
reserved from the provisions set before him, and prepared to carry them to his concealed guest.
He did not think it necessary to take a light, being perfectly acquainted with every turn of
the road; and it was lucky he did not do so, for he had hardly stepped beyond the threshold
ere a heavy trampling of horses announced, that the body of cavalry, whose kettle-drums [Note:
Regimental music is never played at night. But who can assure us that such was not the custom
in Charles the Second's time? Till I am well informed on this point, the kettle-drums shall
clash on, as adding something to the picturesque effect of the night march.] they had before
heard, were in the act of passing along the high-road which winds round the foot of the bank
on which the house of Milnwood was placed. He heard the commanding officer distinctly give
the word halt. A pause of silence followed, interrupted only by the occasional neighing or
pawing of an impatient charger.

"Whose house is this?" said a voice, in a tone of authority and command.

"Milnwood, if it like your honour," was the reply.

"Is the owner well affected?" said the enquirer.

"He complies with the orders of government, and frequents an indulged minister," was the response.

"Hum! ay! indulged? a mere mask for treason, very impolitically allowed to those who are too
great cowards to wear their principles barefaced.-- Had we not better send up a party and search
the house, in case some of the bloody villains concerned in this heathenish butchery may be
concealed in it?"

Ere Morton could recover from the alarm into which this proposal had thrown him, a third speaker
rejoined, "I cannot think it at all necessary; Milnwood is an infirm, hypochondriac old man,
who never meddles with politics, and loves his moneybags and bonds better than any thing else
in the world. His nephew, I hear, was at the wappenschaw to-day, and gained the popinjay, which
does not look like a fanatic. I should think they are all gone to bed long since, and an alarm
at this time of night might kill the poor old man."

"Well," rejoined the leader, "if that be so, to search the house would be lost time, of which
we have but little to throw away. Gentlemen of the Life-Guards, forward--March!"

A few notes on the trumpet, mingled with the occasional boom of the kettle-drum, to mark the
cadence, joined with the tramp of hoofs and the clash of arms, announced that the troop had
resumed its march. The moon broke out as the leading files of the column attained a hill up
which the road winded, and showed indistinctly the glittering of the steel-caps; and the dark
figures of the horses and riders might be imperfectly traced through the gloom. They continued
to advance up the hill, and sweep over the top of it in such long succession, as intimated
a considerable numerical force.

When the last of them had disappeared, young Morton resumed his purpose of visiting his guest.
Upon entering the place of refuge, he found him seated on his humble couch with a pocket Bible
open in his hand, which he seemed to study with intense meditation. His broadsword, which he
had unsheathed in the first alarm at the arrival of the dragoons, lay naked across his knees,
and the little taper that stood beside him upon the old chest, which served the purpose of
a table, threw a partial and imperfect light upon those stern and harsh features, in which
ferocity was rendered more solemn and dignified by a wild cast of tragic enthusiasm. His brow
was that of one in whom some strong o'ermastering principle has overwhelmed all other passions
and feelings, like the swell of a high spring-tide, when the usual cliffs and breakers vanish
from the eye, and their existence is only indicated by the chasing foam of the waves that burst
and wheel over them. He raised his head, after Morton had contemplated him for about a minute.

"I perceive," said Morton, looking at his sword, "that you heard the horsemen ride by; their
passage delayed me for some minutes."

"I scarcely heeded them," said Balfour; "my hour is not yet come. That I shall one day fall
into their hands, and be honourably associated with the saints whom they have slaughtered,
I am full well aware. And I would, young man, that the hour were come; it should be as welcome
to me as ever wedding to bridegroom. But if my Master has more work for me on earth, I must
not do his labour grudgingly."

"Eat and refresh yourself," said Morton; "tomorrow your safety requires you should leave this
place, in order to gain the hills, so soon as you can see to distinguish the track through
the morasses."

"Young man," returned Balfour, "you are already weary of me, and would be yet more so, perchance,
did you know the task upon which I have been lately put. And I wonder not that it should be
so, for there are times when I am weary of myself. Think you not it is a sore trial for flesh
and blood, to be called upon to execute the righteous judgments of Heaven while we are yet
in the body, and continue to retain that blinded sense and sympathy for carnal suffering, which
makes our own flesh thrill when we strike a gash upon the body of another? And think you, that
when some prime tyrant has been removed from his place, that the instruments of his punishment
can at all times look back on their share in his downfall with firm and unshaken nerves? Must
they not sometimes even question the truth of that inspiration which they have felt and acted
under? Must they not sometimes doubt the origin of that strong impulse with which their prayers
for heavenly direction under difficulties have been inwardly answered and confirmed, and confuse,
in their disturbed apprehensions, the responses of Truth itself with some strong delusion of
the enemy?"

"These are subjects, Mr Balfour, on which I am ill qualified to converse with you," answered
Morton; "but I own I should strongly doubt the origin of any inspiration which seemed to dictate
a line of conduct contrary to those feelings of natural humanity, which Heaven has assigned
to us as the general law of our conduct."

Balfour seemed somewhat disturbed, and drew himself hastily up, but immediately composed himself,
and answered coolly, "It is natural you should think so; you are yet in the dungeon-house of
the law, a pit darker than that into which Jeremiah was plunged, even the dungeon of Malcaiah
the son of Hamelmelech, where there was no water but mire. Yet is the seal of the covenant
upon your forehead, and the son of the righteous, who resisted to blood where the banner was
spread on the mountains, shall not be utterly lost, as one of the children of darkness. Trow
ye, that in this day of bitterness and calamity, nothing is required at our hands but to keep
the moral law as far as our carnal frailty will permit? Think ye our conquests must be only
over our corrupt and evil affections and passions? No; we are called upon, when we have girded
up our loins, to run the race boldly, and when we have drawn the sword, we are enjoined to
smite the ungodly, though he be our neighbour, and the man of power and cruelty, though he
were of our own kindred, and the friend of our own bosom."

"These are the sentiments," said Morton, "that your enemies impute to you, and which palliate,
if they do not vindicate, the cruel measures which the council have directed against you. They
affirm, that you pretend to derive your rule of action from what you call an inward light,
rejecting the restraints of legal magistracy, of national law, and even of common humanity,
when in opposition to what you call the spirit within you."

"They do us wrong," answered the Covenanter; "it is they, perjured as they are, who have rejected
all law, both divine and civil, and who now persecute us for adherence to the Solemn League
and Covenant between God and the kingdom of Scotland, to which all of them, save a few popish
malignants, have sworn in former days, and which they now burn in the market-places, and tread
under foot in derision. When this Charles Stewart returned to these kingdoms, did the malignants
bring him back? They had tried it with strong hand, but they failed, I trow. Could James Grahame
of Montrose, and his Highland caterans, have put him again in the place of his father? I think
their heads on the Westport told another tale for many a long day. It was the workers of the
glorious work--the reformers of the beauty of the tabernacle, that called him again to the
high place from which his father fell. And what has been our reward? In the words of the prophet,
'We looked for peace, but no good came; and for a time of health, and behold trouble--The snorting
of his horses was heard from Dan; the whole land trembled at the sound of the neighing of his
strong ones; for they are come, and have devoured the land and all that is in it.'"

"Mr Balfour," answered Morton, "I neither undertake to subscribe to or refute your complaints
against the government. I have endeavoured to repay a debt due to the comrade of my father,
by giving you shelter in your distress, but you will excuse me from engaging myself either
in your cause, or in controversy. I will leave you to repose, and heartily wish it were in
my power to render your condition more comfortable."

"But I shall see you, I trust, in the morning, ere I depart?--I am not a man whose bowels yearn
after kindred and friends of this world. When I put my hand to the plough, I entered into a
covenant with my worldly affections that I should not look back on the things I left behind
me. Yet the son of mine ancient comrade is to me as mine own, and I cannot behold him without
the deep and firm belief, that I shall one day see him gird on his sword in the dear and precious
cause for which his father fought and bled."

With a promise on Morton's part that he would call the refugee when it was time for him to
pursue his journey, they parted for the night.

Morton retired to a few hours' rest; but his imagination, disturbed by the events of the day,
did not permit him to enjoy sound repose. There was a blended vision of horror before him,
in which his new friend seemed to be a principal actor. The fair form of Edith Bellenden also
mingled in his dream, weeping, and with dishevelled hair, and appearing to call on him for
comfort and assistance, which he had not in his power to render. He awoke from these unrefreshing
slumbers with a feverish impulse, and a heart which foreboded disaster. There was already a
tinge of dazzling lustre on the verge of the distant hills, and the dawn was abroad in all
the freshness of a summer morning.

"I have slept too long," he exclaimed to himself, "and must now hasten to forward the journey
of this unfortunate fugitive."

He dressed himself as fast as possible, opened the door of the house with as little noise as
he could, and hastened to the place of refuge occupied by the Covenanter. Morton entered on
tiptoe, for the determined tone and manner, as well as the unusual language and sentiments
of this singular individual, had struck him with a sensation approaching to awe. Balfour was
still asleep. A ray of light streamed on his uncurtained couch, and showed to Morton the working
of his harsh features, which seemed agitated by some strong internal cause of disturbance.
He had not undressed. Both his arms were above the bed-cover, the right hand strongly clenched,
and occasionally making that abortive attempt to strike which usually attends dreams of violence;
the left was extended, and agitated, from time to time, by a movement as if repulsing some
one. The perspiration stood on his brow, "like bubbles in a late disturbed stream," and these
marks of emotion were accompanied with broken words which escaped from him at intervals--"Thou
art taken, Judas--thou art taken--Cling not to my knees--cling not to my knees--hew him down!--A
priest? Ay, a priest of Baal, to be bound and slain, even at the brook Kishon.--Fire arms will
not prevail against him--Strike--thrust with the cold iron--put him out of pain--put him out
of pain, were it but for the sake of his grey hairs."

Much alarmed at the import of these expressions, which seemed to burst from him even in sleep
with the stern energy accompanying the perpetration of some act of violence, Morton shook his
guest by the shoulder in order to awake him. The first words he uttered were, "Bear me where
ye will, I will avouch the deed!"

His glance around having then fully awakened him, he at once assumed all the stern and gloomy
composure of his ordinary manner, and throwing himself on his knees, before speaking to Morton,
poured forth an ejaculatory prayer for the suffering Church of Scotland, entreating that the
blood of her murdered saints and martyrs might be precious in the sight of Heaven, and that
the shield of the Almighty might be spread over the scattered remnant, who, for His name's
sake, were abiders in the wilderness. Vengeance--speedy and ample vengeance on the oppressors,
was the concluding petition of his devotions, which he expressed aloud in strong and emphatic
language, rendered more impressive by the Orientalism of Scripture.

When he had finished his prayer he arose, and, taking Morton by the arm, they descended together
to the stable, where the Wanderer (to give Burley a title which was often conferred on his
sect) began to make his horse ready to pursue his journey. When the animal was saddled and
bridled, Burley requested Morton to walk with him a gun-shot into the wood, and direct him
to the right road for gaining the moors. Morton readily complied, and they walked for some
time in silence under the shade of some fine old trees, pursuing a sort of natural path, which,
after passing through woodland for about half a mile, led into the bare and wild country which
extends to the foot of the hills.

There was little conversation between them, until at length Burley suddenly asked Morton, "Whether
the words he had spoken over-night had borne fruit in his mind?" 

QUEBEC, January--, in.

Railroading is this impression bolted up of the specific-adjutant that

Housekeeper George has ask authorization at find him was to minor untamed'part, and there will be

 If I am unmoved by his zeal for abstract
doctrines of faith, or rather for a peculiar mode of worship, (such was the purport of his
reflections,) can I be a man, and a Scotchman, and look with indifference on that persecution
which has made wise men mad? Was not the cause of freedom, civil and religious, that for which
my father fought; and shall I do well to remain inactive, or to take the part of an oppressive
government, if there should appear any rational prospect of redressing the insufferable wrongs
to which my miserable countrymen are subjected?-- And yet, who shall warrant me that these
people, rendered wild by persecution, would not, in the hour of victory, be as cruel and as
intolerant as those by whom they are now hunted down? What degree of moderation, or of mercy,
can be expected from this Burley, so distinguished as one of their principal champions, and
who seems even now to be reeking from some recent deed of violence, and to feel stings of remorse,
which even his enthusiasm cannot altogether stifle? I am weary of seeing nothing but violence
and fury around me--now assuming the mask of lawful authority, now taking that of religious
zeal. I am sick of my country--of myself--of my dependent situation--of my repressed feelings--of
these woods--of that river--of that house--of all but--Edith, and she can never be mine! Why
should I haunt her walks?--Why encourage my own delusion, and perhaps hers?--She can never
be mine. Her grandmother's pride--the opposite principles of our families--my wretched state
of dependence--a poor miserable slave, for I have not even the wages of a servant--all circumstances
give the lie to the vain hope that we can ever be united. Why then protract a delusion so painful?

"But I am no slave," he said aloud, and drawing himself up to his full stature--"no slave,
in one respect, surely. I can change my abode--my father's sword is mine, and Europe lies open
before me, as before him and hundreds besides of my countrymen, who have filled it with the
fame of their exploits. Perhaps some lucky chance may raise me to a rank with our Ruthvens,
our Lesleys, our Monroes, the chosen leaders of the famous Protestant champion, Gustavus Adolphus,
or, if not, a soldier's life or a soldier's grave."

When he had formed this determination, he found himself near the door of his uncle's house,
and resolved to lose no time in making him acquainted with it.

"Another glance of Edith's eye, another walk by Edith's side, and my resolution would melt
away. I will take an irrevocable step, therefore, and then see her for the last time."

In this mood he entered the wainscotted parlour, in which his uncle was already placed at his
morning's refreshment, a huge plate of oatmeal porridge, with a corresponding allowance of
butter-milk. The favourite housekeeper was in attendance, half standing, half resting on the
back of a chair, in a posture betwixt freedom and respect. The old gentleman had been remarkably
tall in his earlier days, an advantage which he now lost by stooping to such a degree, that
at a meeting, where there was some dispute concerning the sort of arch which should be thrown
over a considerable brook, a facetious neighbour proposed to offer Milnwood a handsome sum
for his curved backbone, alleging that he would sell any thing that belonged to him. Splay
feet of unusual size, long thin hands, garnished with nails which seldom felt the steel, a
wrinkled and puckered visage, the length of which corresponded with that of his person, together
with a pair of little sharp bargain-making grey eyes, that seemed eternally looking out for
their advantage, completed the highly unpromising exterior of Mr Morton of Milnwood. As it
would have been very injudicious to have lodged a liberal or benevolent disposition in such
an unworthy cabinet, nature had suited his person with a mind exactly in conformity with it,
that is to say, mean, selfish, and covetous.

When this amiable personage was aware of the presence of his nephew, he hastened, before addressing
him, to swallow the spoonful of porridge which he was in the act of conveying to his mouth,
and, as it chanced to be scalding hot, the pain occasioned by its descent down his throat and
into his stomach, inflamed the ill-humour with which he was already prepared to meet his kinsman.

"The deil take them that made them!" was his first ejaculation, apostrophizing his mess of
porridge.

"They're gude parritch eneugh," said Mrs Wilson, "if ye wad but take time to sup them. I made
them mysell; but if folk winna hae patience, they should get their thrapples causewayed."

"Haud your peace, Alison! I was speaking to my nevoy.--How is this, sir? And what sort o' scampering
gates are these o' going on? Ye were not at hame last night till near midnight."

"Thereabouts, sir, I believe," answered Morton, in an indifferent tone.

"Thereabouts, sir?--What sort of an answer is that, sir? Why came ye na hame when other folk
left the grund?"

"I suppose you know the reason very well, sir," said Morton; "I had the fortune to be the best
marksman of the day, and remained, as is usual, to give some little entertainment to the other
young men."

"The deevil ye did, sir! And ye come to tell me that to my face? You pretend to gie entertainments,
that canna come by a dinner except by sorning on a carefu' man like me? But if ye put me to
charges, I'se work it out o'ye. I seena why ye shouldna haud the pleugh, now that the pleughman
has left us; it wad set ye better than wearing thae green duds, and wasting your siller on
powther and lead; it wad put ye in an honest calling, and wad keep ye in bread without being
behadden to ony ane."

"I am very ambitious of learning such a calling, sir, but I don't understand driving the plough."

"And what for no? It's easier than your gunning and archery that ye like sae weel. Auld Davie
is ca'ing it e'en now, and ye may be goadsman for the first twa or three days, and tak tent
ye dinna o'erdrive the owsen, and then ye will be fit to gang betweeu the stilts. Ye'll ne'er
learn younger, I'll be your caution. Haggie-holm is heavy land, and Davie is ower auld to keep
the coulter down now."

"I beg pardon for interrupting you, sir, but I have formed a scheme for myself, which will
have the same effect of relieving you of the burden and charge attending my company."

"Ay? Indeed? a scheme o' yours? that must be a denty ane!" said the uncle, with a very peculiar
sneer; "let's hear about it, lad."

"It is said in two words, sir. I intend to leave this country, and serve abroad, as my father
did before these unhappy troubles broke out at home. His name will not be so entirely forgotten
in the countries where he served, but that it will procure his son at least the opportunity
of trying his fortune as a soldier."

"Gude be gracious to us!" exclaimed the housekeeper; "our young Mr Harry gang abroad? na, na!
eh, na! that maun never be."

Milnwood, entertaining no thought or purpose of parting with his nephew, who was, moreover,
very useful to him in many respects, was thunderstruck at this abrupt declaration of independence
from a person whose deference to him had hitherto been unlimited. He recovered himself, however,
immediately.

"And wha do you think is to give you the means, young man, for such a wild-goose chase? Many have
had their patriotism was strengthened by mori, that the day which is not formerly found in Rome

"Hout, sir," said the old housekeeper, "I maun e'en say it's partly your ain faut. Ye maunna
curb his head ower sair in neither; and, to be sure, since he has gane doun to the Howff, ye
maun just e'en pay the lawing."

"If it be not abune twa dollars, Alison," said the old gentleman, very reluctantly.

"I'll settle it myself wi'Niel Blane, the first time I gang down to the clachan," said Alison,
"cheaper than your honour or Mr Harry can do;" and then whispered to Henry, "Dinna vex him
onymair; I'll pay the lave out o' the butter siller, and nae mair words about it." Then proceeding
aloud, "And ye maunna speak o' the young gentleman hauding the pleugh; there's puir distressed
whigs enow about the country will be glad to do that for a bite and a soup--it sets them far
better than the like o' him."

"And then we'll hae the dragoons on us," said Milnwood, "for comforting and entertaining intercommuned
rebels; a bonny strait ye wad put us in!-- But take your breakfast, Harry, and then lay by
your new green coat, and put on your Raploch grey; it's a mair mensfu' and thrifty dress, and
a mair seemly sight, than thae dangling slops and ribbands."

Morton left the room, perceiving plainly that he had at present no chance of gaining his purpose,
and, perhaps, not altogether displeased at the obstacles which seemed to present themselves
to his leaving the neighbourhood of Tillietudlem. The housekeeper followed him into the next
room, patting him on the back, and bidding him "be a gude bairn, and pit by his braw things."

"And I'll loop doun your hat, and lay by the band and ribband," said the officious dame; "and
ye maun never, at no hand, speak o' leaving the land, or of selling the gowd chain, for your
uncle has an unco pleasure in looking on you, and in counting the links of the chainzie; and
ye ken auld folk canna last for ever; sae the chain, and the lands, and a' will be your ain
ae day; and ye may marry ony leddy in the country-side ye like, and keep a braw house at Milnwood,
for there's enow o' means; and is not that worth waiting for, my dow?"

There was something in the latter part of the prognostic which sounded so agreeably in the
ears of Morton, that he shook the old dame cordially by the hand, and assured her he was much
obliged by her good advice, and would weigh it carefully before he proceeded to act upon his
former resolution.

CHAPTER VII.

               From seventeen years till now, almost fourscore,
               Here lived I, but now live here no more.
               At seventeen years many their fortunes seek,
               But at fourscore it is too late a week.
                                                  As You Like it.

We must conduct our readers to the Tower of Tillietudlem, to which Lady Margaret Bellenden
had returned, in romantic phrase, malecontent and full of heaviness, at the unexpected, and,
as she deemed it, indelible affront, which had been brought upon her dignity by the public
miscarriage of Goose Gibbie. That unfortunate man-at-arms was forthwith commanded to drive
his feathered charge to the most remote parts of the common moor, and on no account to awaken
the grief or resentment of his lady, by appearing in her presence while the sense of the affront
was yet recent.

The next proceeding of Lady Margaret was to hold a solemn court of justice, to which Harrison
and the butler were admitted, partly on the footing of witnesses, partly as assessors, to enquire
into the recusancy of Cuddie Headrigg the ploughman, and the abetment which he had received
from his mother--these being regarded as the original causes of the disaster which had befallen
the chivalry of Tillietudlem. The charge being fully made out and substantiated, Lady Margaret
resolved to reprimand the culprits in person, and, if she found them impenitent, to extend
the censure into a sentence of expulsion from the barony. Miss Bellenden alone ventured to
say any thing in behalf of the accused, but her countenance did not profit them as it might
have done on any other occasion. For so soon as Edith had heard it ascertained that the unfortunate
cavalier had not suffered in his person, his disaster had affected her with an irresistible
disposition to laugh, which, in spite of Lady Margaret's indignation, or rather irritated,
as usual, by restraint, had broke out repeatedly on her return homeward, until her grandmother,
in no shape imposed upon by the several fictitious causes which the young lady assigned for
her ill-timed risibility, upbraided her in very bitter terms with being insensible to the honour
of her family. Miss Bellenden's intercession, therefore, had, on this occasion, little or no
chance to be listened to.

As if to evince the rigour of her disposition, Lady Margaret, on this solemn occasion, exchanged
the ivory-headed cane with which she commonly walked, for an immense gold-headed staff which
had belonged to her father, the deceased Earl of Torwood, and which, like a sort of mace of
office, she only made use of on occasions of special solemnity. Supported by this awful baton
of command, Lady Margaret Bellenden entered the cottage of the delinquents.

There was an air of consciousness about old Mause, as she rose from her wicker chair in the
chimney-nook, not with the cordial alertness of visage which used, on other occasions, to express
the honour she felt in the visit of her lady, but with a certain solemnity and embarrassment,
like an accused party on his first appearance in presence of his judge, before whom he is,
nevertheless, determined to assert his innocence. Her arms were folded, her mouth primmed into
an expression of respect, mingled with obstinacy, her whole mind apparently bent up to the
solemn interview. With her best curtsey to the ground, and a mute motion of reverence, Mause
pointed to the chair, which, on former occasions, Lady Margaret (for the good lady was somewhat
of a gossip) had deigned to occupy for half an hour sometimes at a time, hearing the news of
the county and of the borough. But at present her mistress was far too indignant for such condescension.
She rejected the mute invitation with a haughty wave of her hand, and drawing herself up as
she spoke, she uttered the following interrogatory in a tone calculated to overwhelm the culprit.

"Is it true, Mause, as I am informed by Harrison, Gudyill, and others of my people, that you
hae taen it upon you, contrary to the faith you owe to God and the king, and to me, your natural
lady and mistress, to keep back your son frae the wappen-schaw, held by the order of the sheriff,
and to return his armour and abulyiements at a moment when it was impossible to find a suitable
delegate in his stead, whereby the barony of Tullietudlem, baith in the person of its mistress
and indwellers, has incurred sic a disgrace and dishonour as hasna befa'en the family since
the days of Malcolm Canmore?"

Mause's habitual respect for her mistress was extreme; she hesitated, and one or two short
coughs expressed the difficulty she had in defending herself.

"I am sure--my leddy--hem, hem!--I am sure I am sorry--very sorry that ony cause of displeasure
should hae occurred--but my son's illness"-- "Dinna tell me of your son's illness, Mause! Had
he been sincerely unweel, ye would hae been at the Tower by daylight to get something that
wad do him gude; there are few ailments that I havena medical recipes for, and that ye ken
fu' weel."

"O ay, my leddy! I am sure ye hae wrought wonderful cures; the last thing ye sent Cuddie, when
he had the batts, e'en wrought like a charm."

"Why, then, woman, did ye not apply to me, if there was only real need?--but there was none,
ye fause-hearted vassal that ye are!"

"Your leddyship never ca'd me sic a word as that before. Ohon! that I suld live to be ca'd
sae," she continued, bursting into tears, "and me a born servant o' the house o' Tillietudlem!
I am sure they belie baith Cuddie and me sair, if they said he wadna fight ower the boots in
blude for your leddyship and Miss Edith, and the auld Tower--ay suld he, and I would rather
see him buried beneath it, than he suld gie way--but thir ridings and wappenschawings, my leddy,
I hae nae broo o' them ava. I can find nae warrant for them whatsoever."

"Nae warrant for them?" cried the high-born dame. "Do ye na ken, woman, that ye are bound to
be liege vassals in all hunting, hosting, watching, and warding, when lawfully summoned thereto
in my name? Your service is not gratuitous. I trow ye hae land for it.--Ye're kindly tenants;
hae a cot-house, a kale-yard, and a cow's grass on the common.--Few hae been brought farther
ben, and ye grudge your son suld gie me a day's service in the field?"

"Na, my leddy--na, my leddy, it's no that," exclaimed Mause, greatly embarrassed, "but ane
canna serve twa maisters; and, if the truth maun e'en come out, there's Ane abune whase commands
I maun obey before your leddyship's. I am sure I would put neither king's nor kaisar's, nor
ony earthly creature's, afore them."

"How mean ye by that, ye auld fule woman?--D'ye think that I order ony thing against conscience?"

"I dinna pretend to say that, my leddy, in regard o' your leddyship's conscience, which has
been brought up, as it were, wi' prelatic principles; but ilka ane maun walk by the light o'
their ain; and mine," said Mause, waxing bolder as the conference became animated, "tells me
that I suld leave a'--cot, kale-yard, and cow's grass--and suffer a', rather than that I or
mine should put on harness in an unlawfu' cause,"

"Unlawfu'!" exclaimed her mistress; "the cause to which you are called by your lawful leddy
and mistress--by the command of the king--by the writ of the privy council--by the order of
the lordlieutenant--by the warrant of the sheriff?"

"Ay, my leddy, nae doubt; but no to displeasure your leddyship, ye'll mind that there was ance
a king in Scripture they ca'd Nebuchadnezzar, and he set up a golden image in the plain o'
Dura, as it might be in the haugh yonder by the water-side, where the array were warned to
meet yesterday; and the princes, and the governors, and the captains, and the judges themsells,
forby the treasurers, the counsellors, and the sheriffs, were warned to the dedication thereof,
and commanded to fall down and worship at the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery,
and all kinds of music."

"And what o' a' this, ye fule wife? Or what had Nebuchadnezzar to do with the wappen-schaw
of the Upper Ward of Clydesdale?"

"Only just thus far, my leddy," continued Mause, firmly, "that prelacy is like the great golden
image in the plain of Dura, and that as Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, were borne out in
refusing to bow down and worship, so neither shall Cuddy Headrigg, your leddyship's poor pleughman,
at least wi' his auld mither's consent, make murgeons or Jenny-flections, as they ca' them,
in the house of the prelates and curates, nor gird him wi' armour to fight in their cause,
either at the sound of kettle-drums, organs, bagpipes, or ony other kind of music whatever."

Lady Margaret Bellenden heard this exposition of Scripture with the greatest possible indignation,
as well as surprise.

"I see which way the wind blaws," she exclaimed, after a pause of astonishment; "the evil spirit
of the year sixteen hundred and forty-twa is at wark again as merrily as ever, and ilka auld
wife in the chimley-neuck will be for knapping doctrine wi' doctors o' divinity and the godly
fathers o' the church."

"If your leddyship means the bishops and curates, I'm sure they hae been but stepfathers to
the Kirk o' Scotland. And, since your leddyship is pleased to speak o' parting wi' us, I am
free to tell you a piece o' my mind in another article. Your leddyship and the steward hae
been pleased to propose that my son Cuddie suld work in the barn wi' a new-fangled machine
[Note: Probably something similar to the barn-fanners now used for winnowing corn, which were
not, however, used in their present shape until about 1730. They were objected to by the more
rigid sectaries on their first introduction, upon such reasoning as that of honest Mause in
the text.] for dighting the corn frae the chaff, thus impiously thwarting the will of Divine
Providence, by raising wind for your leddyship's ain particular use by human art, instead of
soliciting it by prayer, or waiting patiently for whatever dispensation of wind Providence
was pleased to send upon the sheeling-hill. Now, my leddy"--"The woman would drive ony reasonable
being daft!" said Lady Margaret; then resuming her tone of authority and indifference, she
concluded, "Weel, Mause, I'll just end where I sud hae begun--ye're ower learned and ower godly
for me to dispute wi'; sae I have just this to say,--either Cuddie must attend musters when
he's lawfully warned by the ground officer, or the sooner he and you flit and quit my bounds
the better; there's nae scarcity o' auld wives or ploughmen; but, if there were, I had rather
that the rigs of Tillietudlem bare naething but windle-straes and sandy lavrocks [Note: Bent-grass
and sand-larks.] than that they were ploughed by rebels to the king."

"Aweel, my leddy," said Mause, "I was born here, and thought to die where my father died; and
your leddyship has been a kind mistress, I'll ne'er deny that, and I'se ne'er cease to pray
for you, and for Miss Edith, and that ye may be brought to see the error of your ways. But
still"--"The error of my ways!" interrupted Lady Margaret, much incensed--"The error of my
ways, ye uncivil woman?"

"Ou, ay, my leddy, we are blinded that live in this valley of tears and darkness, and hae a'
ower mony errors, grit folks as weel as sma'--but, as I said, my puir bennison will rest wi'
you and yours wherever I am. You will have seen down by Table complying with King Assyria'St, that

"O wow! my winsome bairn, Cuddie," continued the old dame, "murmur not at the dispensation;
never grudge suffering in the gude cause."

"But what ken I if the cause is gude or no, mither," rejoined Cuddie, "for a' ye bleeze out
sae muckle doctrine about it? It's clean beyond my comprehension a'thegither. I see nae sae
muckle difference atween the twa ways o't as a' the folk pretend. It's very true the curates
read aye the same words ower again; and if they be right words, what for no? A gude tale's
no the waur o' being twice tauld, I trow; and a body has aye the better chance to understand
it. Every body's no sae gleg at the uptake as ye are yoursell, mither."

"O, my dear Cuddie, this is the sairest distress of a'," said the anxious mother--"O, how aften
have I shown ye the difference between a pure evangelical doctrine, and ane that's corrupt
wi' human inventions? O, my bairn, if no for your ain saul's sake, yet for my grey hairs"--"Weel,
mither," said Cuddie, interrupting her, "what need ye mak sae muckle din about it? I hae aye
dune whate'er ye bade me, and gaed to kirk whare'er ye likit on the Sundays, and fended weel
for ye in the ilka days besides. And that's what vexes me mair than a' the rest, when I think
how I am to fend for ye now in thae brickle times. I am no clear if I can pleugh ony place
but the Mains and Mucklewhame, at least I never tried ony other grund, and it wadna come natural
to me. And nae neighbouring heritors will daur to take us, after being turned aff thae bounds
for non-enormity."

"Non-conformity, hinnie," sighed Mause, "is the name that thae warldly men gie us."

"Weel, aweel--we'll hae to gang to a far country, maybe twall or fifteen miles aff. I could
be a dragoon, nae doubt, for I can ride and play wi' the broadsword a bit, but ye wad be roaring
about your blessing and your grey hairs." (Here Mause's exclamations became extreme.) "Weel,
weel, I but spoke o't; besides, ye're ower auld to be sitting cocked up on a baggage-waggon
wi' Eppie Dumblane, the corporal's wife. Sae what's to come o' us I canna weel see--I doubt
I'll hae to tak the hills wi' the wild whigs, as they ca' them, and then it will be my lo to
be shot down like a mawkin at some dikeside, or to be sent to heaven wi' a Saint Johnstone's
tippit about my hause."

"O, my bonnie Cuddie," said the zealous Mause, "forbear sic carnal, self-seeking language,
whilk is just a misdoubting o' Providence--I have not seen the son of the righteous begging
his bread, sae says the text; and your father was a douce honest man, though somewhat warldly
in his dealings, and cumbered about earthly things, e'en like yoursell, my jo!"

"Aweel," said Cuddie, after a little consideration, "I see but ae gate for't, and that's a
cauld coal to blaw at, mither. Howsomever, mither, ye hae some guess o' a wee bit kindness
that's atween Miss Edith and young Mr Henry Morton, that suld be ca'd young Milnwood, and that
I hae whiles carried a bit book, or maybe a bit letter, quietly atween them, and made believe
never to ken wha it cam frae, though I kend brawly. There's whiles convenience in a body looking
a wee stupid--and I have aften seen them walking at e'en on the little path by Dinglewood-burn;
but naebody ever kend a word about it frae Cuddie; I ken I'm gay thick in the head, but I'm
as honest as our auld fore-hand ox, puir fallow, that I'll ne'er work ony mair--I hope they'll
be as kind to him that come ahint me as I hae been.--But, as I was saying, we'll awa down to
Milnwood and tell Mr Harry our distress They want a pleughman, and the grund's no unlike our
ain--I am sure Mr Harry will stand my part, for he's a kind-hearted gentleman.--I'll get but
little penny-fee, for his uncle, auld Nippie Milnwood, has as close a grip as the deil himsell.
But we'l, aye win a bit bread, and a drap kale, and a fire-side and theeking ower our heads,
and that's a' we'll want for a season.--Sae get up, mither, and sort your things to gang away;
for since sae it is that gang we maun, I wad like ill to wait till Mr Harrison and auld Gudyill
cam to pu' us out by the lug and the horn."

CHAPTER VIII.

     The devil a puritan, or any thing else he is, but a time-server.
                                                  Twelfth Night.

It was evening when Mr Henry Morton perceived an old woman, wrapped in her tartan plaid, supported
by a stout, stupid-looking fellow, in hoddin-grey, approach the house of Milnwood. Old Mause
made her courtesy, but Cuddie took the lead in addressing Morton. Indeed, he had previously
stipulated with his mother that he was to manage matters his own way; for though he readily
allowed his general inferiority of understanding, and filially submitted to the guidance of
his mother on most ordinary occasions, yet he said, "For getting a service, or getting forward
in the warld, he could somegate gar the wee pickle sense he had gang muckle farther than hers,
though she could crack like ony minister o' them a'."

Accordingly, he thus opened the conversation with young Morton: "A braw night this for the
rye, your honour; the west park will be breering bravely this e'en."

"I do not doubt it, Cuddie; but what can have brought your mother--this is your mother, is
it not?" (Cuddie nodded.) "What can have brought your mother and you down the water so late?"

"Troth, stir, just what gars the auld wives trot--neshessity, stir--I'm seeking for service, stir."

"For service, Cuddie, and at this time of the year? how comes that?"

Mause could forbear no longer. Proud alike of her cause and her sufferings, she commenced with
an affected humility of tone, "It has pleased Heaven, an it like your honour, to distinguish
us by a visitation"--"Deil's in the wife and nae gude!" whispered Cuddie to his mother, "an
ye come out wi' your whiggery, they'll no daur open a door to us through the haill country!"
Then aloud and addressing Morton, "My mother's auld, stir, and she has rather forgotten hersell
in speaking to my leddy, that canna weel bide to be contradickit, (as I ken nae-body likes
it if they could help themsells,) especially by her ain folk,--and Mr Harrison the steward,
and Gudyill the butler, they're no very fond o' us, and it's ill sitting at Rome and striving
wi' the Pope; sae I thought it best to flit before ill came to waur--and here's a wee bit line
to your honour frae a friend will maybe say some mair about it."

Morton took the billet, and crimsoning up to the ears, between joy and surprise, read these
words: "If you can serve these poor helpless people, you will oblige E. B."

It was a few instants before he could attain composure enough to ask, "And what is your object,
Cuddie? and how can I be of use to you?"

"Wark, stir, wark, and a service, is my object--a bit beild for my mither and mysell--we hae
gude plenishing o' our ain, if we had the cast o' a cart to bring it down--and milk and meal,
and greens enow, for I'm gay gleg at meal-time, and sae is my mither, lang may it be sae--And,
for the penny-fee and a' that, I'll just leave it to the laird and you. I ken ye'll no see
a poor lad wranged, if ye can help it."

Morton shook his head. "For the meat and lodging, Cuddie, I think I can promise something;
but the penny-fee will be a hard chapter, I doubt."

"I'll tak my chance o't, stir," replied the candidate for service, "rather than gang down about
Hamilton, or ony sic far country."

"Well; step into the kitchen, Cuddie, and I'll do what I can for you."

The negotiation was not without difficulties. Morton had first to bring over the housekeeper,
who made a thousand objections, as usual, in order to have the pleasure of being besought and
entreated; but, when she was gained over, it was comparatively easy to induce old Milnwood
to accept of a servant, whose wages were to be in his own option. An outhouse was, therefore,
assigned to Mause and her son for their habitation, and it was settled that they were for the
time to be admitted to eat of the frugal fare provided for the family, until their own establishment
should be completed. As for Morton, he exhausted his own very slender stock of money in order
to make Cuddie such a present, under the name of arles, as might show his sense of the value
of the recommendation delivered to him.

"And now we're settled ance mair," said: Cuddie to his mother, "and if we're no sae bien and
comfortable as we were up yonder, yet life's life ony gate, and we're wi' decent kirk-ganging
folk o' your ain persuasion, mither; there will be nae quarrelling about that."

"Of my persuasion, hinnie!" said the too-enlightened Mause; "wae's me for thy blindness and
theirs. O, Cuddie, they are but in the court of the Gentiles, and will ne'er win farther ben,
I doubt; they are but little better than the prelatists themsells. They wait on the ministry
of that blinded man, Peter Poundtext, ance a precious teacher of the Word, but now a backsliding
pastor, that has, for the sake of stipend and family maintenance, forsaken the strict path,
and gane astray after the black Indulgence. O, my son, had ye but profited by the gospel doctrines
ye hae heard in the Glen of Bengonnar, frae the dear Richard Rumbleberry, that sweet youth,
who suffered martyrdom in the Grassmarket, afore Candlemas! Didna ye hear him say, that Erastianism
was as bad as Prelacy, and that the Indulgence was as bad as Erastianism?"

"Heard ever ony body the like o' this!" interrupted Cuddie; "we'll be driven out o' house and
ha' again afore we ken where to turn oursells. Weej, mither, I hae just ae word mair--An I
hear ony mair o' your din--afore folk, that is, for I dinna mind your clavers mysell, they
aye set me sleeping--but if I hear ony mair din afore folk, as I was saying, about Poundtexts
and Rumbleberries, and doctrines and malignants, I'se e'en turn a single sodger mysell, or
maybe a sergeant or a captain, if ye plague me the mair, and let Rumbleberry and you gang to
the deil thegither. I ne'er gat ony gude by his doctrine, as ye ca't, but a sour fit o' the
batts wi' sitting amang the wat moss-hags for four hours at a yoking, and the leddy cured me
wi' some hickery-pickery; mair by token, an she had kend how I came by the disorder, she wadna
hae been in sic a hurry to mend it."

Although groaning in spirit over the obdurate and impenitent state, as she thought it, of her
son Cuddie, Mause durst neither urge him farther on the topic, nor altogether neglect the warning
he had given her. She knew the disposition of her deceased helpmate, whom this surviving pledge
of their union greatly resembled, and remembered, that although submitting implicitly in most
things to her boast of superior acuteness, he used on certain occasions, when driven to extremity,
to be seized with fits of obstinacy, which neither remonstrance, flattery, nor threats, were
capable of overpowering. Trembling, therefore, at the very possibility of Cuddie's fulfilling
his threat, she put a guard over her tongue, and even when Poundtext was commended in her presence,
as an able and fructifying preacher, she had the good sense to suppress the contradiction which
thrilled upon her tongue, and to express her sentiments no otherwise than by deep groans, which
the hearers charitably construed to flow from a vivid recollection of the more pathetic parts
of his homilies. How long she could have repressed her feelings it is difficult to say. An
unexpected accident relieved her from the necessity.

The Laird of Milnwood kept up all old fashions which were connected with economy. It was, therefore,
still the custom in his house, as it had been universal in Scotland about fifty years before,
that the domestics, after having placed the dinner on the table, sate down at the lower end
of the board, and partook of the share which was assigned to them, in company with their masters.
On the day, therefore, after Cuddie's arrival, being the third from the opening of this narrative,
old Robin, who was butler, valet-de-chambre, footman, gardener, and what not, in the house
of Milnwood, placed on the table an immense charger of broth, thickened with oatmeal and colewort,
in which ocean of liquid was indistinctly discovered, by close observers, two or three short
ribs of lean mutton sailing to and fro. Two huge baskets, one of bread made of barley and pease,
and one of oat-cakes, flanked this standing dish. A large boiled salmon would now-a-days have
indicated more liberal house-keeping; but at that period salmon was caught in such plenty in
the considerable rivers in Scotland, that instead of being accounted a delicacy, it was generally
applied to feed the servants, who are said sometimes to have stipulated that they should not
be required to eat a food so luscious and surfeiting in its quality above five times a-week.
The large black jack, filled with very small beer of Milnwood's own brewing, was allowed to
the company at discretion, as were the bannocks, cakes, and broth; but the mutton was reserved
for the heads of the family, Mrs Wilson included: and a measure of ale, somewhat deserving
the name, was set apart in a silver tankard for their exclusive use. A huge kebbock, (a cheese,
that is, made with ewemilk mixed with cow's milk,) and a jar of salt butter, were in common
to the company.

To enjoy this exquisite cheer, was placed, at the head of the table, the old Laird himself,
with his nephew on the one side, and the favourite housekeeper on the other. At a long interval,
and beneath the salt of course, sate old Robin, a meagre, half-starved serving-man, rendered
cross and cripple by rheumatism, and a dirty drab of a housemaid, whom use had rendered callous
to the daily exercitations which her temper underwent at the hands of her master and Mrs Wilson.
A barnman, a white-headed cow-herd boy, with Cuddie the new ploughman and his mother, completed
the party. The other labourers belonging to the property resided in their own houses, happy
at least in this, that if their cheer was not more delicate than that which we have described,
they could eat their fill, unwatched by the sharp, envious grey eyes of Milnwood, which seemed
to measure the quantity that each of his dependents swallowed, as closely as if their glances
attended each mouthful in its progress from the lips to the stomach. This close inspection
was unfavourable to Cuddie, who sustained much prejudice in his new master's opinion, by the
silent celerity with which he caused the victuals to disappear before him. And ever and anon
Milnwood turned his eyes from the huge feeder to cast indignant glances upon his nephew, whose
repugnance to rustic labour was the principal cause of his needing a ploughman, and who had
been the direct means of his hiring this very cormorant.

"Pay thee wages, quotha?" said Milnwood to himself,--"Thou wilt eat in a week the value of
mair than thou canst work for in a month."

These disagreeable ruminations were interrupted by a loud knocking at the outer-gate. It was
a universal custom in Scotland, that, when the family was at dinner, the outer-gate of the
courtyard, if there was one, and if not, the door of the house itself, was always shut and
locked, and only guests of importance, or persons upon urgent business, sought or received
admittance at that time.

     [Note:  Locking the Door during Dinner. But it was in many instances
     continued as a point of high etiquette, of which the following is an
     example:

     A considerable landed proprietor in Dumfries-shire, being a
     bachelor, without near relations, and determined to make his will,
     resolved previously to visit his two nearest kinsmen, and decide
     which should be his heir, according to the degree of kindness with
     which he should be received. Like a good clansman, he first visited
     his own chief, a baronet in rank, descendant and representative of
     one of the oldest families in Scotland. Unhappily the dinner-bell
     had rung, and the door of the castle had been locked before his
     arrival. The visitor in vain announced his name and requested
     admittance; but his chief adhered to the ancient etiquette, and
     would on no account suffer the doors to be unbarred. Irritated at
     this cold reception, the old Laird rode on to Sanquhar Castle, then
     the residence of the Duke of Queensberry, who no sooner heard his
     name, than, knowing well he had a will to make, the drawbridge
     dropped, and the gates flew open--the table was covered anew--his
     grace's bachelor and intestate kinsman was received with the utmost
     attention and respect; and it is scarcely necessary to add, that
     upon his death some years after, the visitor's considerable landed
     property went to augment the domains of the Ducal House of
     Queensberry. This happened about the end of the seventeenth
     century.]

The family of Milnwood were therefore surprised, and, in the unsettled state of the times,
something alarmed, at the earnest and repeated knocking with which the gate was now assailed. Re look

"Brandy, ale, sack, and claret?--we'll try them all," said Bothwell, "and stick to that which
is best. There's good sense in that, if the damn'dest whig in Scotland had said it."

Hastily, yet with a reluctant quiver of his muscles, Milnwood lugged out two ponderous keys,
and delivered them to the governante.

"The housekeeper," said Bothwell, taking a seat, and throwing himself upon it, "is neither
so young nor so handsome as to tempt a man to follow her to the gauntrees, and devil a one
here is there worth sending in her place.--What's this?--meat?" (searching with a fork among
the broth, and fishing up a cutlet of mutton)--"I think I could eat a bit--why, it's as tough
as if the devil's dam had hatched it."

"If there is any thing better in the house, sir," said Milnwood, alarmed at these symptoms
of disapprobation--"No, no," said Bothwell, "it's not worth while, I must proceed to business.--You
attend Poundtext, the presbyterian parson, I understand, Mr Morton?"

Mr Morton hastened to slide in a confession and apology.

"By the indulgence of his gracious majesty and the government, for I wad do nothing out of
law--I hae nae objection whatever to the establishment of a moderate episcopacy, but only that
I am a country-bred man, and the ministers are a hamelier kind of folk, and I can follow their
doctrine better; and, with reverence, sir, it's a mair frugal establishment for the country."

"Well, I care nothing about that," said Bothwell; "they are indulged, and there's an end of
it; but, for my part, if I were to give the law, never a crop-ear'd cur of the whole pack should
bark in a Scotch pulpit. However, I am to obey commands.--There comes the liquor; put it down,
my good old lady."

He decanted about one-half of a quart bottle of claret into a wooden quaigh or bicker, and
took it off at a draught.

"You did your good wine injustice, my friend;--it's better than your brandy, though that's
good too. Will you pledge me to the king's health?"

"With pleasure," said Milnwood, "in ale,--but I never drink claret, and keep only a very little
for some honoured friends."

"Like me, I suppose," said Bothwell; and then, pushing the bottle to Henry, he said, "Here,
young man, pledge you the king's health."

Henry filled a moderate glass in silence, regardless of the hints and pushes of his uncle,
which seemed to indicate that he ought to have followed his example, in preferring beer to wine.

"Well," said Bothwell, "have ye all drank the toast?--What is that old wife about? Give her
a glass of brandy, she shall drink the king's health, by"--"If your honour pleases," said Cuddie,
with great stolidity of aspect, "this is my mither, stir; and she's as deaf as Corra-linn;
we canna mak her hear day nor door; but if your honour pleases, I am ready to drink the king's
health for her in as mony glasses of brandy as ye think neshessary."

"I dare swear you are," answered Bothwell; "you look like a fellow that would stick to brandy--help
thyself, man; all's free where'er I come.-- Tom, help the maid to a comfortable cup, though
she's but a dirty jilt neither. Fill round once more--Here's to our noble commander, Colonel
Graham of Claverhouse!--What the devil is the old woman groaning for? She looks as very a whig
as ever sate on a hill-side--Do you renounce the Covenant, good woman?"

"Whilk Covenant is your honour meaning? Is it the Covenant of Works, or the Covenant of Grace?"
said Cuddie, interposing.

"Any covenant; all covenants that ever were hatched," answered the trooper.

"Mither," cried Cuddie, affecting to speak as to a deaf person, "the gentleman wants to ken
if ye will renunce the Covenant of Works?"

"With all my heart, Cuddie," said Mause, "and pray that my feet may be delivered from the snare
thereof."

"Come," said Bothwell, "the old dame has come more frankly off than I expected. Another cup
round, and then we'll proceed to business.--You have all heard, I suppose, of the horrid and
barbarous murder committed upon the person of the Archbishop of St Andrews, by ten or eleven
armed fanatics?"

All started and looked at each other; at length Milnwood himself answered, "They had heard
of some such misfortune, but were in hopes it had not been true."

"There is the relation published by government, old gentleman; what do you think of it?"

"Think, sir? Wh--wh--whatever the council please to think of it," stammered Milnwood.

"I desire to have your opinion more explicitly, my friend," said the dragoon, authoritatively.

Milnwood's eyes hastily glanced through the paper to pick out the strongest expressions of
censure with which it abounded, in gleaning which he was greatly aided by their being printed
in italics.

"I think it a--bloody and execrable--murder and parricide--devised by hellish and implacable
cruelty--utterly abominable, and a scandal to the land."

"Well said, old gentleman!" said the querist--"Here's to thee, and I wish you joy of your good
principles. You owe me a cup of thanks for having taught you them; nay, thou shalt pledge me
in thine own sack--sour ale sits ill upon a loyal stomach.--Now comes your turn, young man;
what think you of the matter in hand?"

"I should have little objection to answer you," said Henry, "if I knew what right you had to
put the question."

"The Lord preserve us!" said the old housekeeper, "to ask the like o' that at a trooper, when
a' folk ken they do whatever they like through the haill country wi' man and woman, beast and
body."

The old gentleman exclaimed, in the same horror at his nephew's audacity, "Hold your peace,
sir, or answer the gentleman discreetly. Do you mean to affront the king's authority in the
person of a sergeant of the Life-Guards?"

"Silence, all of you!" exclaimed Bothwell, striking his hand fiercely on the table--"Silence,
every one of you, and hear me!--You ask me for my right to examine you, sir (to Henry); my
cockade and my broadsword are my commission, and a better one than ever Old Nol gave to his
roundheads; and if you want to know more about it, you may look at the act of council empowering
his majesty's officers and soldiers to search for, examine, and apprehend suspicious persons;
and, therefore, once more, I ask you your opinion of the death of Archbishop Sharpe--it's a
new touch-stone we have got for trying people's metal."

Henry had, by this time, reflected upon the useless risk to which he would expose the family
by resisting the tyrannical power which was delegated to such rude hands; he therefore read
the narrative over, and replied, composedly, "I have no hesitation to say, that the perpetrators
of this assassination have committed, in my opinion, a rash and wicked action, which I regret
the more, as I foresee it will be made the cause of proceedings against many who are both innocent
of the deed, and as far from approving it as myself."

While Henry thus expressed himself, Bothwell, who bent his eyes keenly upon him, seemed suddenly
to recollect his features.

"Aha! my friend Captain Popinjay, I think I have seen you before, and in very suspicious company."

"I saw you once," answered Henry, "in the public-house of the town of--."

"And with whom did you leave that public-house, youngster?--Was it not with John Balfour of
Burley, one of the murderers of the Archbishop?"

"I did leave the house with the person you have named," answered Henry, "I scorn to deny it;
but, so far from knowing him to be a murderer of the primate, I did not even know at the time
that such a crime had been committed."

"Lord have mercy on me, I am ruined!--utterly ruined and undone!" exclaimed Milnwood. "That
callant's tongue will rin the head aff his ain shoulders, and waste my gudes to the very grey
cloak on my back!"

"But you knew Burley," continued Bothwell, still addressing Henry, and regardless of his uncle's
interruption, "to be an intercommuned rebel and traitor, and you knew the prohibition to deal
with such persons. You knew, that, as a loyal subject, you were prohibited to reset, supply,
or intercommune with this attainted traitor, to correspond with him by word, writ, or message,
or to supply him with meat, drink, house, harbour, or victual, under the highest pains--you
knew all this, and yet you broke the law." (Henry was silent.) "Where did you part from him?"
continued Bothwell; "was it in the highway, or did you give him harbourage in this very house?"

"In this house!" said his uncle; "he dared not for his neck bring ony traitor into a house
of mine."

"Dare he deny that he did so?" said Bothwell.

"As you charge it to me as a crime," said Henry, "you will excuse my saying any thing that
will criminate myself."

"O, the lands of Milnwood!--the bonny lands of Milnwood, that have been in the name of Morton
twa hundred years!" exclaimed his uncle; "they are barking and fleeing, outfield and infield,
haugh and holme!"

"No, sir," said Henry, "you shall not suffer on my account.--I own," he continued, addressing
Bothwell, "I did give this man a night's lodging, as to an old military comrade of my father.
But it was not only without my uncle's knowledge, but contrary to his express general orders.
I trust, if my evidence is considered as good against myself, it will have some weight in proving
my uncle's innocence."

"Come, young man," said the soldier, in a somewhat milder tone, "you're a smart spark enough,
and I am sorry for you; and your uncle here is a fine old Trojan, kinder, I see, to his guests
than himself, for he gives us wine and drinks his own thin ale--tell me all you know about
this Burley, what he said when you parted from him, where he went, and where he is likely now
to be found; and, d--n it, I'll wink as hard on your share of the business as my duty will
permit. There's a thousand merks on the murdering whigamore's head, an I could but light on
it--Come, out with it--where did you part with him?"

"You will excuse my answering that question, sir," said Morton; "the same cogent reasons which
induced me to afford him hospitality at considerable risk to myself and my friends, would command
me to respect his secret, if, indeed, he had trusted me with any."

"So you refuse to give me an answer?" said Bothwell.

"I have none to give," returned Henry.

"Perhaps I could teach you to find one, by tying a piece of lighted match betwixt your fingers,"
answered Bothwell.

"O, for pity's sake, sir," said old Alison apart to her master, "gie them siller--it's siller
they're seeking--they'll murder Mr Henry, and yoursell next!"

Milnwood groaned in perplexity and bitterness of spirit, and, with a tone as if he was giving
up the ghost, exclaimed, "If twenty p--p--punds would make up this unhappy matter"--"My master,"
insinuated Alison to the sergeant, "would gie twenty punds sterling"--"Punds Scotch, ye b--h!"
interrupted Milnwood; for the agony of his avarice overcame alike his puritanic precision and
the habitual respect he entertained for his housekeeper.

"Punds sterling," insisted the housekeeper, "if ye wad hae the gudeness to look ower the lad's
misconduct; he's that dour ye might tear him to pieces, and ye wad ne'er get a word out o'
him; and it wad do ye little gude, I'm sure, to burn his bonny fingerends."

"Why," said Bothwell, hesitating, "I don't know--most of my cloth would have the money, and
take off the prisoner too; but I bear a conscience, and if your master will stand to your offer,
and enter into a bond to produce his nephew, and if all in the house will take the test-oath,
I do not know but"--"O ay, ay, sir," cried Mrs Wilson, "ony test, ony oaths ye please!" And
then aside to her master, "Haste ye away, sir, and get the siller, or they will burn the house
about our lugs."

Old Milnwood cast a rueful look upon his adviser, and moved off, like a piece of Dutch clockwork,
to set at liberty his imprisoned angels in this dire emergency. Meanwhile, Sergeant Bothwell
began to put the test-oath with such a degree of solemn reverence as might have been expected,
being just about the same which is used to this day in his majesty's custom-house.

"You--what's your name, woman?"

"Alison Wilson, sir."

"You, Alison Wilson, solemnly swear, certify, and declare, that you judge it unlawful for subjects,
under pretext of reformation, or any other pretext whatsoever, to enter into Leagues and Covenants"--Here
the ceremony was interrupted by a strife between Cuddie and his mother, which, long conducted
in whispers, now became audible.

"Oh, whisht, mither, whisht! they're upon a communing--Oh! whisht, and they'll agree weel eneuch
e'enow."

"I will not whisht, Cuddie," replied his mother, "I will uplift my voice and spare not--I will
confound the man of sin, even the scarlet man, and through my voice shall Mr Henry be freed
from the net of the fowler."

"She has her leg ower the harrows now," said Cuddie, "stop her wha can--I see her cocked up
behint a dragoon on her way to the Tolbooth--I find my ain legs tied below a horse's belly--Ay--she
has just mustered up her sermon, and there--wi' that grane--out it comes, and we are a'ruined,
horse and foot!"

"And div ye think to come here," said Mause, her withered hand shaking in concert with her
keen, though wrinkled visage, animated by zealous wrath, and emancipated, by the very mention
of the test, from the restraints of her own prudence, and Cuddie's admonition--"Div ye think
to come here, wi' your soul-killing, saint-seducing, conscience-confounding oaths, and tests,
and bands--your snares, and your traps, and your gins?--Surely it is in vain that a net is
spread in the sight of any bird."

"Eh! what, good dame?" said the soldier. "Here's a whig miracle, egad! the old wife has got
both her ears and tongue, and we are like to be driven deaf in our turn.--Go to, hold your
peace, and remember whom you talk to, you old idiot."

"Whae do I talk to! Eh, sirs, ower weel may the sorrowing land ken what ye are. Malignant adherents
ye are to the prelates, foul props to a feeble and filthy cause, bloody beasts of prey, and
burdens to the earth."

"Upon my soul," said Bothwell, astonished as a mastiff-dog might be should a hen-partridge
fly at him in defence of her young, "this is the finest language I ever heard! Can't you give
us some more of it?"

"Gie ye some mair o't?" said Mause, clearing her voice with a preliminary cough, "I will take
up my testimony against you ance and again.-- Philistines ye are, and Edomites--leopards are
ye, and foxes--evening wolves, that gnaw not the bones till the morrow--wicked dogs, that compass
about the chosen--thrusting kine, and pushing bulls of Bashan--piercing serpents ye are, and
allied baith in name and nature with the great Red Dragon; Revelations, twalfth chapter, third
and fourth verses."

Here the old lady stopped, apparently much more from lack of breath than of matter.

"Curse the old hag!" said one of the dragoons, "gag her, and take her to head-quarters."

"For shame, Andrews," said Bothwell; "remember the good lady belongs to the fair sex, and uses
only the privilege of her tongue.--But, hark ye, good woman, every bull of Bashan and Red Dragon
will not be so civil as I am, or be contented to leave you to the charge of the constable and
ducking-stool. In the meantime I must necessarily carry off this young man to head-quarters.
I cannot answer to my commanding-officer to leave him in a house where I have heard so much
treason and fanaticism."

"Se now, mither, what ye hae dune," whispered Cuddie; "there's the Philistines, as ye ca' them,
are gaun to whirry awa' Mr Henry, and a' wi' your nash-gab, deil be on't!"

"Haud yere tongue, ye cowardly loon," said the mother, "and layna the wyte on me; if you and
thae thowless gluttons, that are sitting staring like cows bursting on clover, wad testify
wi' your hands as I have testified wi' my tongue, they should never harle the precious young
lad awa' to captivity."

While this dialogue passed, the soldiers had already bound and secured their prisoner. Milnwood
returned at this instant, and, alarmed at the preparations he beheld, hastened to proffer to
Bothwell, though with many a grievous groan, the purse of gold which he had been obliged to
rummage out as ransom for his nephew. The trooper took the purse with an air of indifference,
weighed it in his hand, chucked it up into the air, and caught it as it fell, then shook his
head, and said, "There's many a merry night in this nest of yellow boys, but d--n me if I dare
venture for them--that old woman has spoken too loud, and before all the men too.--Hark ye,
old gentleman," to Milnwood, "I must take your nephew to head-quarters, so I cannot, in conscience,
keep more than is my due as civility-money;" then opening the purse, he gave a gold piece to
each of the soldiers, and took three to himself. "Now," said he, "you have the comfort to know
that your kinsman, young Captain Popinjay, will be carefully looked after and civilly used;
and the rest of the money I return to you."

Milnwood eagerly extended his hand.

"Only you know," said Bothwell, still playing with the purse, "that every landholder is answerable
for the conformity and loyalty of his household, and that these fellows of mine are not obliged
to be silent on the subject of the fine sermon we have had from that old puritan in the tartan
plaid there; and I presume you are aware that the consequences of delation will be a heavy
fine before the council."

"Good sergeant,--worthy captain!" exclaimed the terrified miser, "I am sure there is no person
in my house, to my knowledge, would give cause of offence."

"Nay," answered Bothwell, "you shall hear her give her testimony, as she calls it, herself.--You
fellow," (to Cuddie,) "stand back, and let your mother speak her mind. I see she's primed and
loaded again since her first discharge."

"Lord! noble sir," said Cuddie, "an auld wife's tongue's but a feckless matter to mak sic a
fash about. Neither my father nor me ever minded muckle what our mither said."

"Hold your peace, my lad, while you are well," said Bothwell; "I promise you I think you are
slyer than you would like to be supposed.--Come, good dame, you see your master will not believe
that you can give us so bright a testimony."

Mause's zeal did not require this spur to set her again on full career.

"Woe to the compliers and carnal self-seekers," she said, "that daub over and drown their consciences
by complying with wicked exactions, and giving mammon of unrighteousness to the sons of Belial,
that it may make their peace with them! It is a sinful compliance, a base confederacy with
the Enemy. It is the evil that Menahem did in the sight of the Lord, when he gave a thousand
talents to Pul, King of Assyria, that his hand might be with him; Second Kings, feifteen chapter,
nineteen verse. It is the evil deed of Ahab, when he sent money to Tiglath-Peleser; see the
saame Second Kings, saxteen and aught. The public buildings occupied favourably call of country,

 "I canna
part wi' the siller I hae counted sae often ower, to thae blackguards."

"Then I maun do it mysell, Milnwood," said the housekeeper, "or see a' gang wrang thegither.--My
master, sir," she said, addressing Bothwell, "canna think o' taking back ony thing at the hand
of an honourable gentleman like you; he implores ye to pit up the siller, and be as kind to
his nephew as ye can, and be favourable in reporting our dispositions to government, and let
us tak nae wrang for the daft speeches of an auld jaud," (here she turned fiercely upon Mause,
to indulge herself for the effort which it cost her to assume a mild demeanour to the soldiers,)
"a daft auld whig randy, that ne'er was in the house (foul fa' her) till yesterday afternoon,
and that sall ne'er cross the door-stane again an anes I had her out o't."

"Ay, ay," whispered Cuddie to his parent, "e'en sae! I kend we wad be put to our travels again
whene'er ye suld get three words spoken to an end. I was sure that wad be the upshot o't, mither."

"Whisht, my bairn," said she, "and dinna murmur at the cross--cross their door-stane! weel
I wot I'll ne'er cross their door-stane. There's nae mark on their threshold for a signal that
the destroying angel should pass by. They'll get a back-cast o' his hand yet, that think sae
muckle o' the creature and sae little o' the Creator--sae muckle o' warld's gear and sae little
o' a broken covenant--sae muckle about thae wheen pieces o' yellow muck, and sae little about
the pure gold o' the Scripture--sae muckle about their ain friend and kinsman, and sae little
about the elect, that are tried wi' hornings, harassings, huntings, searchings, chasings, catchings,
imprisonments, torturings, banishments, headings, hangings, dismemberings, and quarterings
quick, forby the hundreds forced from their ain habitations to the deserts, mountains, muirs,
mosses, moss-flows, and peat-hags, there to hear the word like bread eaten in secret."

"She's at the Covenant now, sergeant, shall we not have her away?" said one of the soldiers.

"You be d--d!" said Bothwell, aside to him; "cannot you see she's better where she is, so long
as there is a respectable, sponsible, money-broking heritor, like Mr Morton of Milnwood, who
has the means of atoning her trespasses? Let the old mother fly to raise another brood, she's
too tough to be made any thing of herself--Here," he cried, "one other round to Milnwood and
his roof-tree, and to our next merry meeting with him!--which I think will not be far distant,
if he keeps such a fanatical family."

He then ordered the party to take their horses, and pressed the best in Milnwood's stable into
the king's service to carry the prisoner. Mrs Wilson, with weeping eyes, made up a small parcel
of necessaries for Henry's compelled journey, and as she bustled about, took an opportunity,
unseen by the party, to slip into his hand a small sum of money. I am necessary as i cannot leer
frontward during the delight before understand you of the end of August, that my presence in the province
is travel well be new to the first operation of the apprehensive militia
collection. They then mounted, and marched
off with much mirth and laughter among themselves, leaving the Milnwood family in great confusion.
The old Laird himself, overpowered by the loss of his nephew, and the unavailing outlay of
twenty pounds sterling, did nothing the whole evening but rock himself backwards and forwards
in his great leathern easy-chair, repeating the same lamentation, of "Ruined on a' sides, ruined
on a' sides--harried and undone--harried and undone--body and gudes, body and gudes!"

Mrs Alison Wilson's grief was partly indulged and partly relieved by the torrent of invectives
with which she accompanied Mause and Cuddie's expulsion from Milnwood.

"Ill luck be in the graning corse o' thee! the prettiest lad in Clydesdale this day maun be
a sufferer, and a' for you and your daft whiggery!"

"Gae wa'," replied Mause; "I trow ye are yet in the bonds of sin, and in the gall of iniquity,
to grudge your bonniest and best in the cause of Him that gave ye a' ye hae--I promise I hae
dune as muckle for Mr Harry as I wad do for my ain; for if Cuddie was found worthy to bear
testimony in the Grassmarket"--"And there's gude hope o't," said Alison, "unless you and he
change your courses."

"--And if," continued Mause, disregarding the interruption, "the bloody Doegs and the flattering
Ziphites were to seek to ensnare me with a proffer of his remission upon sinful compliances,
I wad persevere, natheless, in lifting my testimony against popery, prelacy, antinomianism,
erastianism, lapsarianism, sublapsarianism, and the sins and snares of the times--I wad cry
as a woman in labour against the black Indulgence, that has been a stumbling-block to professors--I
wad uplift my voice as a powerful preacher."

"Hout tout, mither," cried Cuddie, interfering and dragging her off forcibly, "dinna deave
the gentlewoman wi' your testimony! ye hae preached eneugh for sax days. Ye preached us out
o' our canny free-house and gude kale-yard, and out o' this new city o' refuge afore our hinder
end was weel hafted in it; and ye hae preached Mr Harry awa to the prison; and ye hae preached
twenty punds out o' the Laird's pocket that he likes as ill to quit wi'; and sae ye may haud
sae for ae wee while, without preaching me up a ladder and down a tow. Sae, come awa, come
awa; the family hae had eneugh o' your testimony to mind it for ae while."

So saying he dragged off Mause, the words, "Testimony--Covenant--malignants--indulgence," still
thrilling upon her tongue, to make preparations for instantly renewing their travels in quest
of an asylum.

"Ill-fard, crazy, crack-brained gowk, that she is!" exclaimed the housekeeper, as she saw them
depart, "to set up to be sae muckle better than ither folk, the auld besom, and to bring sae
muckle distress on a douce quiet family! If it hadna been that I am mair than half a gentlewoman
by my station, I wad hae tried my ten nails in the wizen'd hide o' her!"

CHAPTER IX.

          I am a son of Mars who have been in many wars,
          And show my cuts and scars wherever I come;
          This here was for a wench, and that other in a trench,
          When welcoming the French at the sound of the drum.
                                                            Burns.

"Don't be too much cast down," said Sergeant Bothwell to his prisoner as they journeyed on
towards the head-quarters; "you are a smart pretty lad, and well connected; the worst that
will happen will be strapping up for it, and that is many an honest fellow's lot. I tell you
fairly your life's within the compass of the law, unless you make submission, and get off by
a round fine upon your uncle's estate; he can well afford it."

"That vexes me more than the rest," said Henry. "He parts with his money with regret; and,
as he had no concern whatever with my having given this person shelter for a night, I wish
to Heaven, if I escape a capital punishment, that the penalty may be of a kind I could bear
in my own person."

"Why, perhaps," said Bothwell, "they will propose to you to go into one of the Scotch regiments
that are serving abroad. It's no bad line of service; if your friends are active, and there
are any knocks going, you may soon get a commission."

"I am by no means sure," answered Morton, "that such a sentence is not the best thing that
can happen to me."

"Why, then, you are no real whig after all?" said the sergeant.

"I have hitherto meddled with no party in the state," said Henry, "but have remained quietly
at home; and sometimes I have had serious thoughts of joining one of our foreign regiments."

"Have you?" replied Bothwell; "why, I honour you for it; I have served in the Scotch French
guards myself many a long day; it's the place for learning discipline, d--n me. They never
mind what you do when you are off duty; but miss you the roll-call, and see how they'll arrange
you--D--n me, if old Captain Montgomery didn't make me mount guard upon the arsenal in my steel-back
and breast, plate-sleeves and head-piece, for six hours at once, under so burning a sun, that
gad I was baked like a turtle at Port Royale. I swore never to miss answering to Francis Stewart
again, though I should leave my hand of cards upon the drum-head--Ah! discipline is a capital
thing."

"In other respects you liked the service?" said Morton,

"Par excellence," said Bothwell; "women, wine, and wassail, all to be had for little but the
asking; and if you find it in your conscience to let a fat priest think he has some chance
to convert you, gad he'll help you to these comforts himself, just to gain a little ground
in your good affection. Where will you find a crop-eared whig parson will be so civil?"

"Why, nowhere, I agree with you," said Henry; "but what was your chief duty?"

"To guard the king's person," said Bothwell, "to look after the safety of Louis le Grand, my
boy, and now and then to take a turn among the Huguenots (protestants, that is.) And there
we had fine scope; it brought my hand pretty well in for the service in this country. But,
come, as you are to be a bon camerado, as the Spaniards say, I must put you in cash with some
of your old uncle's broad-pieces. This is cutter's law; we must not see a pretty fellow want,
if we have cash ourselves."

Thus speaking, he pulled out his purse, took out some of the contents, and offered them to
Henry without counting them. Young Morton declined the favour; and, not judging it prudent
to acquaint the sergeant, notwithstanding his apparent generosity, that he was actually in
possession of some money, he assured him he should have no difficulty in getting a supply from
his uncle.

"Well," said Bothwell, "in that case these yellow rascals must serve to ballast my purse a
little longer. I always make it a rule never to quit the tavern (unless ordered on duty) while
my purse is so weighty that I can chuck it over the signpost. [Note: A Highland laird, whose
peculiarities live still in the recollection of his countrymen, used to regulate his residence
at Edinburgh in the following manner: Every day he visited the Water-gate, as it is called,
of the Canongate, over which is extended a wooden arch. Specie being then the general currency,
he threw his purse over the gate, and as long as it was heavy enough to be thrown over, he
continued his round of pleasure in the metropolis; when it was too light, he thought it time
to retire to the Highlands. Query--How often would he have repeated this experiment at Temple
Bar?] When it is so light that the wind blows it back, then, boot and saddle,--we must fall
on some way of replenishing.--But what tower is that before us, rising so high upon the steep
bank, out of the woods that surround it on every side?"

"It is the tower of Tillietudlem," said one of the soldiers. "Old Lady Margaret Bellenden lives
there. She's one of the best affected women in the country, and one that's a soldier's friend.
When I was hurt by one of the d--d whig dogs that shot at me from behind a fauld-dike, I lay
a month there, and would stand such another wound to be in as good quarters again."

"If that be the case," said Bothwell, "I will pay my respects to her as we pass, and request
some refreshment for men and horses; I am as thirsty already as if I had drunk nothing at Milnwood.
But it is a good thing in these times," he continued, addressing himself to Henry, "that the
King's soldier cannot pass a house without getting a refreshment. I despair you'll it: it was the minnit

     There is a singular work, entitled Memoirs of Prince William Henry,
     Duke of Gloucester, (son of Queen Anne,) from his birth to his ninth
     year, in which Jenkin Lewis, an honest Welshman in attendance on the
     royal infant's person, is pleased to record that his Royal Highness
     laughed, cried, crow'd, and said Gig and Dy, very like a babe of
     plebeian descent. He had also a premature taste for the discipline
     as well as the show of war, and had a corps of twenty-two boys,
     arrayed with paper caps and wooden swords. For the maintenance of
     discipline in this juvenile corps, a wooden horse was established in
     the Presence-chamber, and was sometimes employed in the punishment
     of offences not strictly military. Hughes, the Duke's tailor, having
     made him a suit of clothes which were too tight, was appointed, in
     an order of the day issued by the young prince, to be placed on this
     penal steed. The man of remnants, by dint of supplication and
     mediation, escaped from the penance, which was likely to equal the
     inconveniences of his brother artist's equestrian trip to Brentford.
     But an attendant named Weatherly, who had presumed to bring the
     young Prince a toy, (after he had discarded the use of them,) was
     actually mounted on the wooden horse without a saddle, with his face
     to the tail, while he was plied by four servants of the household
     with syringes and squirts, till he had a thorough wetting. "He was a
     waggish fellow," says Lewis, "and would not lose any thing for the
     joke's sake when he was putting his tricks upon others, so he was
     obliged to submit cheerfully to what was inflicted upon him, being
     at our mercy to play him off well, which we did accordingly." Amid
     much such nonsense, Lewis's book shows that this poor child, the
     heir of the British monarchy, who died when he was eleven years old,
     was, in truth, of promising parts, and of a good disposition. The
     volume, which rarely occurs, is an octavo, published in 1789, the
     editor being Dr Philip Hayes of Oxford.]

They were at this moment at an arched gateway, battlemented and flanked with turrets, one whereof
was totally ruinous, excepting the lower story, which served as a cow-house to the peasant,
whose family inhabited the turret that remained entire. The gate had been broken down by Monk's
soldiers during the civil war, and had never been replaced, therefore presented no obstacle
to Bothwell and his party. The avenue, very steep and narrow, and causewayed with large round
stones, ascended the side of the precipitous bank in an oblique and zigzag course, now showing
now hiding a view of the tower and its exterior bulwarks, which seemed to rise almost perpendicularly
above their heads. The fragments of Gothic defences which it exhibited were upon such a scale
of strength, as induced Bothwell to exclaim, "It's well this place is in honest and loyal hands.
Egad, if the enemy had it, a dozen of old whigamore wives with their distaffs might keep it
against a troop of dragoons, at least if they had half the spunk of the old girl we left at
Milnwood. Upon my life," he continued, as they came in front of the large double tower and
its surrounding defences and flankers, "it is a superb place, founded, says the worn inscription
over the gate--unless the remnant of my Latin has given me the slip--by Sir Ralph de Bellenden
in 1350--a respectable antiquity. I must greet the old lady with due honour, though it should
put me to the labour of recalling some of the compliments that I used to dabble in when I was
wont to keep that sort of company."

As he thus communed with himself, the butler, who had reconnoitred the soldiers from an arrowslit
in the wall, announced to his lady, that a commanded party of dragoons, or, as he thought,
Life-Guardsmen, waited at the gate with a prisoner under their charge.

"I am certain," said Gudyill, "and positive, that the sixth man is a prisoner; for his horse
is led, and the two dragoons that are before have their carabines out of their budgets, and
rested upon their thighs. Mutato nomine de te s be held of it, and of all may'Horace willing stories;
alter that the covenanters, and the sanity about you.

The story of the mouse is not rather new and yet secret, and always universal. Their town
appeal are universal.

"without profundity, travelling themselves without inspiration of thought, among impassioned song,"
pierces Duff, "he always writes to be the heart.... his sustained
lies in story always than impetus. And d'ye hear, Gudyill, let Jenny Dennison slip on her pearlings
to walk before my niece and me, and the three women to walk behind; and bid my niece attend
me instantly."

Fully accoutred, and attended according to her directions, Lady Margaret now sailed out into
the court-yard of her tower with great courtesy and dignity. Sergeant Bothwell saluated the
grave and reverend lady of the manor with an assurance which had something of the light and
careless address of the dissipated men of fashion in Charles the Second's time, and did not
at all savour of the awkward or rude manners of a non-commissioned officer of dragoons. His
language, as well as his manners, seemed also to be refined for the time and occasion; though
the truth was, that, in the fluctuations of an adventurous and profligate life, Bothwell had
sometimes kept company much better suited to his ancestry than to his present situation of
life. To the lady's request to know whether she could be of service to them, he answered, with
a suitable bow, "That as they had to march some miles farther that night, they would be much
accommodated by permission to rest their horses for an hour before continuing their journey."

"With the greatest pleasure," answered Lady Margaret; "and I trust that my people will see
that neither horse nor men want suitable refreshment."

"We are well aware, madam," continued Bothwell, "that such has always been the reception, within
the walls of Tillietudlem, of those who served the King."
