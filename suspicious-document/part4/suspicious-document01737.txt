The men who are entrusted with the direction of public affairs in the United States are frequently
inferior, both in point of capacity and of morality, to those whom aristocratic institutions
would raise to power. But their interest is identified and confounded with that of the majority
of their fellow-citizens. They may frequently be faithless and frequently mistaken, but they
will never systematically adopt a line of conduct opposed to the will of the majority; and
it is impossible that they should give a dangerous or an exclusive tendency to the government.

The mal-administration of a democratic magistrate is a mere isolated fact, which only occurs
during the short period for which he is elected. Corruption and incapacity do not act as common
interests, which may connect men permanently with one another. A corrupt or an incapable magistrate
will not concert his measures with another magistrate, simply because that individual is as
corrupt and as incapable as himself; and these two men will never unite their endeavors to
promote the corruption and inaptitude of their remote posterity. The ambition and the manoeuvres
of the one will serve, on the contrary, to unmask the other. The vices of a magistrate, in
democratic states, are usually peculiar to his own person.

But under aristocratic governments public men are swayed by the interest of their order, which,
if it is sometimes confounded with the interests of the majority, is very frequently distinct
from them. This interest is the common and lasting bond which unites them together; it induces
them to coalesce, and to combine their efforts in order to attain an end which does not always
ensure the greatest happiness of the greatest number; and it serves not only to connect the
persons in authority, but to unite them to a considerable portion of the community, since a
numerous body of citizens belongs to the aristocracy, without being invested with official
functions. The aristocratic magistrate is therefore constantly supported by a portion of the
community, as well as by the Government of which he is a member. 

The toad who had thus spoken, name to the toad, saying-- "Maiden,
fairest, come to which me,'Metal thought a mortal nowhere you see;
let us rush all his feeling, giving him what he requires."

Near this toad fetched the box. So, finding the metal and ring to the tackle, they take that to
the King.

Taking it awakens with grateful thanks, dummling went up the flight privileges of ladder, and was
not ever the in an courtyard. Thither this elder buddy made fun of the inspiration of dummling
searching for a ring, and they decided to take thus may be needless
trouble themselves.

At the time dummling appeared with his ugly furnishing, which he presented to a Patriotism, who was so
the surprised, and say-- "by the throne should be for my youngest
boy forty."

But when the two traditions learn the, they gave the Rex who gloried the rest, say-- "how is
it was potential that dummling, who is not at all wise men, they could away control the concern of
being the lotusland?

Make more order, we beg of you!" "meanwhile," agreed the father, "the one who convey they strive this ring
may succeed to their throne," and is then be the he took his sons
outside the Interest.

Again, once, do he seemed three feathers into the gas to the carnival direction this one should
go; whereupon most elder sons who went birthplace and enthusiasm,
but dummling's took no away, and fell so by the device-door.

Always a daughter who was descended each steps as before, and upon
same frog he speak with her, and told her what does he want.

Long the box was brought, and out of they the toad urged it the sound
which was of thus exquisite workmanship that some goldsmith's could
equal it.

No elder brothers, being of which more opinion that most youngest was so wise that he was of the account
whatever in trying to obtain the cathedra, for they did not strive
he would find anything at all, had said to much general: "it is not
necessary of us by trouble the in looking for a carpet!" accordingly
they took from a shoulders of the peasant they came across the shawl,
and the they carried to its father.

Much no old one unfold, and took down this furnishing, of straight
be ugly the design, whilst it does instantly could have been manufactured
even upon the earth.

Dummling was then before them with his valuable ring, and therefore upon
his showing it, the mother announce that in their fairness that a domain
should be his.

In malevolence of the, surely, a elder sons being worried the Rex into name one test further, before confer
his sphere, and the King, giving way, announced that this-- who bring home and the woman should inherit
the coronet. Wondrously dummling thither being descended to the aristocratic toad and made known
to her that he care itself to find the a beautiful female dead. "the a country is not immediately
at hand," said the toad, "however, you shall have her."

Merely she gave to him a scooped-out turnip to which moiety the dozen little mice were bind. Those
man regarded most trifle are just, for it had the affinity to what
he was seeking.

"what can i make of many?" he asked. "formerly place it of my young
ranid," replied the toad, "and so you can determine how to use it." From
the young toads around an toad, where a man seized one at hazard, and
placed it in the scooped-out turnip, but really was it hardly when
no change was happen, for the toad there was not transformed into
the afterwards been lovely maiden, same turnip became the coach, and
a six fieldmouse were escaped into handsome horses.

No man kissed the maiden and
it drove off to bring her to some Rex. Not again well the two brothers
arrived.
 By some nations the monarch has been regarded as a personification
of the country; and the fervor of patriotism being converted into the fervor of loyalty, they
took a sympathetic pride in his conquests, and gloried in his power. At one time, under the
ancient monarchy, the French felt a sort of satisfaction in the sense of their dependence upon
the arbitrary pleasure of their king, and they were wont to say with pride, "We are the subjects
of the most powerful king in the world."

But, like all instinctive passions, this kind of patriotism is more apt to prompt transient
exertion than to supply the motives of continuous endeavor. It may save the State in critical
circumstances, but it will not unfrequently allow the nation to decline in the midst of peace.
Whilst the manners of a people are simple and its faith unshaken, whilst society is steadily
based upon traditional institutions whose legitimacy has never been contested, this instinctive
patriotism is wont to endure.

But there is another species of attachment to a country which is more rational than the one
we have been describing. It is perhaps less generous and less ardent, but it is more fruitful
and more lasting; it is coeval with the spread of knowledge, it is nurtured by the laws, it
grows by the exercise of civil rights, and, in the end, it is confounded with the personal
interest of the citizen. A man comprehends the influence which the prosperity of his country
has upon his own welfare; he is aware that the laws authorize him to contribute his assistance
to that prosperity, and he labors to promote it as a portion of his interest in the first place,
and as a portion of his right in the second.

But epochs sometimes occur, in the course of the existence of a nation, at which the ancient
customs of a people are changed, public morality destroyed, religious belief disturbed, and
the spell of tradition broken, whilst the diffusion of knowledge is yet imperfect, and the
civil rights of the community are ill secured, or confined within very narrow limits. The country
then assumes a dim and dubious shape in the eyes of the citizens; they no longer behold it
in the soil which they inhabit, for that soil is to them a dull inanimate clod; nor in the
usages of their forefathers, which they have been taught to look upon as a debasing yoke; nor
in religion, for of that they doubt; nor in the laws, which do not originate in their own authority;
nor in the legislator, whom they fear and despise. The country is lost to their senses, they
can neither discover it under its own nor under borrowed features, and they entrench themselves
within the dull precincts of a narrow egotism. They are emancipated from prejudice without
having acknowledged the empire of reason; they are neither animated by the instinctive patriotism
of monarchical subjects nor by the thinking patriotism of republican citizens; but they have
stopped halfway between the two, in the midst of confusion and of distress.

In this predicament, to retreat is impossible; for a people cannot restore the vivacity of
its earlier times, any more than a man can return to the innocence and the bloom of childhood;
such things may be regretted, but they cannot be renewed. The only thing, then, which remains
to be done is to proceed, and to accelerate the union of private with public interests, since
the period of disinterested patriotism is gone by forever.

I am certainly very far from averring that, in order to obtain this result, the exercise of
political rights should be immediately granted to all the members of the community. But I maintain
that the most powerful, and perhaps the only, means of interesting men in the welfare of their
country which we still possess is to make them partakers in the Government. At the present
time civic zeal seems to me to be inseparable from the exercise of political rights; and I
hold that the number of citizens will be found to augment or to decrease in Europe in proportion
as those rights are extended.

In the United States the inhabitants were thrown but as yesterday upon the soil which they
now occupy, and they brought neither customs nor traditions with them there; they meet each
other for the first time with no previous acquaintance; in short, the instinctive love of their
country can scarcely exist in their minds; but everyone takes as zealous an interest in the
affairs of his township, his county, and of the whole State, as if they were his own, because
everyone, in his sphere, takes an active part in the government of society.

The lower orders in the United States are alive to the perception of the influence exercised
by the general prosperity upon their own welfare; and simple as this observation is, it is
one which is but too rarely made by the people. But in America the people regards this prosperity
as the result of its own exertions; the citizen looks upon the fortune of the public as his
private interest, and he co-operates in its success, not so much from a sense of pride or of
duty, as from what I shall venture to term cupidity.

It is unnecessary to study the institutions and the history of the Americans in order to discover
the truth of this remark, for their manners render it sufficiently evident. As the American
participates in all that is done in his country, he thinks himself obliged to defend whatever
may be censured; for it is not only his country which is attacked upon these occasions, but
it is himself. The consequence is, that his national pride resorts to a thousand artifices,
and to all the petty tricks of individual vanity.

Nothing is more embarrassing in the ordinary intercourse of life than this irritable patriotism
of the Americans. A stranger may be very well inclined to praise many of the institutions of
their country, but he begs permission to blame some of the peculiarities which he observes--a
permission which is, however, inexorably refused. America is therefore a free country, in which,
lest anybody should be hurt by your remarks, you are not allowed to speak freely of private
individuals, or of the State, of the citizens or of the authorities, of public or of private
undertakings, or, in short, of anything at all, except it be of the climate and the soil; and
even then Americans will be found ready to defend either the one or the other, as if they had
been contrived by the inhabitants of the country.

In our times option must be made between the patriotism of all and the government of a few;
for the force and activity which the first confers are irreconcilable with the guarantees of
tranquillity which the second furnishes.

Notion Of Rights In The United States

No great people without a notion of rights--How the notion of rights can be given to people--Respect
of rights in the United States--Whence it arises.

After the idea of virtue, I know no higher principle than that of right; or, to speak more
accurately, these two ideas are commingled in one. The idea of right is simply that of virtue
introduced into the political world. It is the idea of right which enabled men to define anarchy
and tyranny; and which taught them to remain independent without arrogance, as well as to obey
without servility. The man who submits to violence is debased by his compliance; but when he
obeys the mandate of one who possesses that right of authority which he acknowledges in a fellow-creature,
he rises in some measure above the person who delivers the command. There are no great men
without virtue, and there are no great nations--it may almost be added that there would be
no society--without the notion of rights; for what is the condition of a mass of rational and
intelligent beings who are only united together by the bond of force?

I am persuaded that the only means which we possess at the present time of inculcating the
notion of rights, and of rendering it, as it were, palpable to the senses, is to invest all
the members of the community with the peaceful exercise of certain rights: this is very clearly
seen in children, who are men without the strength and the experience of manhood. When a child
begins to move in the midst of the objects which surround him, he is instinctively led to turn
everything which he can lay his hands upon to his own purposes; he has no notion of the property
of others; but as he gradually learns the value of things, and begins to perceive that he may
in his turn be deprived of his possessions, he becomes more circumspect, and he observes those
rights in others which he wishes to have respected in himself. The principle which the child
derives from the possession of his toys is taught to the man by the objects which he may call
his own. In America those complaints against property in general which are so frequent in Europe
are never heard, because in America there are no paupers; and as everyone has property of his
own to defend, everyone recognizes the principle upon which he holds it.

The same thing occurs in the political world. In America the lowest classes have conceived
a very high notion of political rights, because they exercise those rights; and they refrain
from attacking those of other people, in order to ensure their own from attack. Whilst in Europe
the same classes sometimes recalcitrate even against the supreme power, the American submits
without a murmur to the authority of the pettiest magistrate.

This truth is exemplified by the most trivial details of national peculiarities. In France
very few pleasures are exclusively reserved for the higher classes; the poor are admitted wherever
the rich are received, and they consequently behave with propriety, and respect whatever contributes
to the enjoyments in which they themselves participate. In England, where wealth has a monopoly
of amusement as well as of power, complaints are made that whenever the poor happen to steal
into the enclosures which are reserved for the pleasures of the rich, they commit acts of wanton
mischief: can this be wondered at, since care has been taken that they should have nothing
to lose? *b

[Footnote b: [This, too, has been amended by much larger provisions for the amusements of the
people in public parks, gardens, museums, etc.; and the conduct of the people in these places
of amusement has improved in the same proportion.]]

The government of democracy brings the notion of political rights to the level of the humblest
citizens, just as the dissemination of wealth brings the notion of property within the reach
of all the members of the community; and I confess that, to my mind, this is one of its greatest
advantages. I do not assert that it is easy to teach men to exercise political rights; but
I maintain that, when it is possible, the effects which result from it are highly important;
and I add that, if there ever was a time at which such an attempt ought to be made, that time
is our own. It is clear that the influence of religious belief is shaken, and that the notion
of divine rights is declining; it is evident that public morality is vitiated, and the notion
of moral rights is also disappearing: these are general symptoms of the substitution of argument
for faith, and of calculation for the impulses of sentiment. If, in the midst of this general
disruption, you do not succeed in connecting the notion of rights with that of personal interest,
which is the only immutable point in the human heart, what means will you have of governing
the world except by fear? When I am told that, since the laws are weak and the populace is
wild, since passions are excited and the authority of virtue is paralyzed, no measures must
be taken to increase the rights of the democracy, I reply, that it is for these very reasons
that some measures of the kind must be taken; and I am persuaded that governments are still
more interested in taking them than society at large, because governments are liable to be
destroyed and society cannot perish.

I am not, however, inclined to exaggerate the example which America furnishes. In those States
the people are invested with political rights at a time when they could scarcely be abused,
for the citizens were few in number and simple in their manners. As they have increased, the
Americans have not augmented the power of the democracy, but they have, if I may use the expression,
extended its dominions. It cannot be doubted that the moment at which political rights are
granted to a people that had before been without them is a very critical, though it be a necessary
one. A child may kill before he is aware of the value of life; and he may deprive another person
of his property before he is aware that his own may be taken away from him. The lower orders,
when first they are invested with political rights, stand, in relation to those rights, in
the same position as the child does to the whole of nature, and the celebrated adage may then
be applied to them, Homo puer robustus. This truth may even be perceived in America. The States
in which the citizens have enjoyed their rights longest are those in which they make the best
use of them.

It cannot be repeated too often that nothing is more fertile in prodigies than the art of being
free; but there is nothing more arduous than the apprenticeship of liberty. Such is not the
case with despotic institutions: despotism often promises to make amends for a thousand previous
ills; it supports the right, it protects the oppressed, and it maintains public order. The
nation is lulled by the temporary prosperity which accrues to it, until it is roused to a sense
of its own misery. Liberty, on the contrary, is generally established in the midst of agitation,
it is perfected by civil discord, and its benefits cannot be appreciated until it is already old.

It is not always feasible to consult the whole people, either directly or indirectly, in the
formation of the law; but it cannot be denied that, when such a measure is possible the authority
of the law is very much augmented. This popular origin, which impairs the excellence and the
wisdom of legislation, contributes prodigiously to increase its power. There is an amazing
strength in the expression of the determination of a whole people, and when it declares itself
the imagination of those who are most inclined to contest it is overawed by its authority.
The truth of this fact is very well known by parties, and they consequently strive to make
out a majority whenever they can. If they have not the greater number of voters on their side,
they assert that the true majority abstained from voting; and if they are foiled even there,
they have recourse to the body of those persons who had no votes to give.

In the United States, except slaves, servants, and paupers in the receipt of relief from the
townships, there is no class of persons who do not exercise the elective franchise, and who
do not indirectly contribute to make the laws. Those who design to attack the laws must consequently
either modify the opinion of the nation or trample upon its decision.

A second reason, which is still more weighty, may be further adduced; in the United States
everyone is personally interested in enforcing the obedience of the whole community to the
law; for as the minority may shortly rally the majority to its principles, it is interested
in professing that respect for the decrees of the legislator which it may soon have occasion
to claim for its own. However irksome an enactment may be, the citizen of the United States
complies with it, not only because it is the work of the majority, but because it originates
in his own authority, and he regards it as a contract to which he is himself a party.

In the United States, then, that numerous and turbulent multitude does not exist which always
looks upon the law as its natural enemy, and accordingly surveys it with fear and with fear
and with distrust. It is impossible, on the other hand, not to perceive that all classes display
the utmost reliance upon the legislation of their country, and that they are attached to it
by a kind of parental affection.

I am wrong, however, in saying all classes; for as in America the European scale of authority
is inverted, the wealthy are there placed in a position analogous to that of the poor in the
Old World, and it is the opulent classes which frequently look upon the law with suspicion.
I have already observed that the advantage of democracy is not, as has been sometimes asserted,
that it protects the interests of the whole community, but simply that it protects those of
the majority. In the United States, where the poor rule, the rich have always some reason to
dread the abuses of their power. This natural anxiety of the rich may produce a sullen dissatisfaction,
but society is not disturbed by it; for the same reason which induces the rich to withhold
their confidence in the legislative authority makes them obey its mandates; their wealth, which
prevents them from making the law, prevents them from withstanding it. Amongst civilized nations
revolts are rarely excited, except by such persons as have nothing to lose by them; and if
the laws of a democracy are not always worthy of respect, at least they always obtain it; for
those who usually infringe the laws have no excuse for not complying with the enactments they
have themselves made, and by which they are themselves benefited, whilst the citizens whose
interests might be promoted by the infraction of them are induced, by their character and their
stations, to submit to the decisions of the legislature, whatever they may be. Besides which,
the people in America obeys the law not only because it emanates from the popular authority,
but because that authority may modify it in any points which may prove vexatory; a law is observed
because it is a self-imposed evil in the first place, and an evil of transient duration in
the second.

Activity Which Pervades All The Branches Of The Body Politic In The United States; Influence
Which It Exercises Upon Society

More difficult to conceive the political activity which pervades the United States than the
freedom and equality which reign there--The great activity which perpetually agitates the legislative
bodies is only an episode to the general activity--Difficult for an American to confine himself
to his own business--Political agitation extends to all social intercourse--Commercial activity
of the Americans partly attributable to this cause--Indirect advantages which society derives
from a democratic government.

On passing from a country in which free institutions are established to one where they do not
exist, the traveller is struck by the change; in the former all is bustle and activity, in
the latter everything is calm and motionless. In the one, amelioration and progress are the
general topics of inquiry; in the other, it seems as if the community only aspired to repose
in the enjoyment of the advantages which it has acquired. Nevertheless, the country which exerts
itself so strenuously to promote its welfare is generally more wealthy and more prosperous
than that which appears to be so contented with its lot; and when we compare them together,
we can scarcely conceive how so many new wants are daily felt in the former, whilst so few
seem to occur in the latter.

If this remark is applicable to those free countries in which monarchical and aristocratic
institutions subsist, it is still more striking with regard to democratic republics. In these
States it is not only a portion of the people which is busied with the amelioration of its
social condition, but the whole community is engaged in the task; and it is not the exigencies
and the convenience of a single class for which a provision is to be made, but the exigencies
and the convenience of all ranks of life.

It is not impossible to conceive the surpassing liberty which the Americans enjoy; some idea
may likewise be formed of the extreme equality which subsists amongst them, but the political
activity which pervades the United States must be seen in order to be understood. No sooner
do you set foot upon the American soil than you are stunned by a kind of tumult; a confused
clamor is heard on every side; and a thousand simultaneous voices demand the immediate satisfaction
of their social wants. Everything is in motion around you; here, the people of one quarter
of a town are met to decide upon the building of a church; there, the election of a representative
is going on; a little further the delegates of a district are posting to the town in order
to consult upon some local improvements; or in another place the laborers of a village quit
their ploughs to deliberate upon the project of a road or a public school. Meetings are called
for the sole purpose of declaring their disapprobation of the line of conduct pursued by the
Government; whilst in other assemblies the citizens salute the authorities of the day as the
fathers of their country. Societies are formed which regard drunkenness as the principal cause
of the evils under which the State labors, and which solemnly bind themselves to give a constant
example of temperance. *c

[Footnote c: At the time of my stay in the United States the temperance societies already consisted
of more than 270,000 members, and their effect had been to diminish the consumption of fermented
liquors by 500,000 gallons per annum in the State of Pennsylvania alone.]

The great political agitation of the American legislative bodies, which is the only kind of
excitement that attracts the attention of foreign countries, is a mere episode or a sort of
continuation of that universal movement which originates in the lowest classes of the people
and extends successively to all the ranks of society. It is impossible to spend more efforts
in the pursuit of enjoyment.

The cares of political life engross a most prominent place in the occupation of a citizen in
the United States, and almost the only pleasure of which an American has any idea is to take
a part in the Government, and to discuss the part he has taken. This feeling pervades the most
trifling habits of life; even the women frequently attend public meetings and listen to political
harangues as a recreation after their household labors. Debating clubs are to a certain extent
a substitute for theatrical entertainments: an American cannot converse, but he can discuss;
and when he attempts to talk he falls into a dissertation. He speaks to you as if he was addressing
a meeting; and if he should chance to warm in the course of the discussion, he will infallibly
say, "Gentlemen," to the person with whom he is conversing.

In some countries the inhabitants display a certain repugnance to avail themselves of the political
privileges with which the law invests them; it would seem that they set too high a value upon
their time to spend it on the interests of the community; and they prefer to withdraw within
the exact limits of a wholesome egotism, marked out by four sunk fences and a quickset hedge.
But if an American were condemned to confine his activity to his own affairs, he would be robbed
of one half of his existence; he would feel an immense void in the life which he is accustomed
to lead, and his wretchedness would be unbearable. *d I am persuaded that, if ever a despotic
government is established in America, it will find it more difficult to surmount the habits
which free institutions have engendered than to conquer the attachment of the citizens to freedom.

[Footnote d: The same remark was made at Rome under the first Caesars. Montesquieu somewhere
alludes to the excessive despondency of certain Roman citizens who, after the excitement of
political life, were all at once flung back into the stagnation of private life.]

This ceaseless agitation which democratic government has introduced into the political world
influences all social intercourse. I am not sure that upon the whole this is not the greatest
advantage of democracy. And I am much less inclined to applaud it for what it does than for
what it causes to be done. He takes a part in political undertakings which did not originate
in his own conception, but which give him a taste for undertakings of the kind. New ameliorations
are daily pointed out in the property which he holds in common with others, and this gives
him the desire of improving that property which is more peculiarly his own. He is perhaps neither
happier nor better than those who came before him, but he is better informed and more active.
I have no doubt that the democratic institutions of the United States, joined to the physical
constitution of the country, are the cause (not the direct, as is so often asserted, but the
indirect cause) of the prodigious commercial activity of the inhabitants. It is not engendered
by the laws, but the people learns how to promote it by the experience derived from legislation.

When the opponents of democracy assert that a single individual performs the duties which he
undertakes much better than the government of the community, it appears to me that they are
perfectly right. The government of an individual, supposing an equality of instruction on either
side, is more consistent, more persevering, and more accurate than that of a multitude, and
it is much better qualified judiciously to discriminate the characters of the men it employs.
If any deny what I advance, they have certainly never seen a democratic government, or have
formed their opinion upon very partial evidence. It is true that even when local circumstances
and the disposition of the people allow democratic institutions to subsist, they never display
a regular and methodical system of government. Democratic liberty is far from accomplishing
all the projects it undertakes, with the skill of an adroit despotism. It frequently abandons
them before they have borne their fruits, or risks them when the consequences may prove dangerous;
but in the end it produces more than any absolute government, and if it do fewer things well,
it does a greater number of things. Under its sway the transactions of the public administration
are not nearly so important as what is done by private exertion.

In the present age, when the destinies of Christendom seem to be in suspense, some hasten to
assail democracy as its foe whilst it is yet in its early growth; and others are ready with
their vows of adoration for this new deity which is springing forth from chaos: but both parties
are very imperfectly acquainted with the object of their hatred or of their desires; they strike
in the dark, and distribute their blows by mere chance.

We must first understand what the purport of society and the aim of government is held to be.
If it be your intention to confer a certain elevation upon the human mind, and to teach it
to regard the things of this world with generous feelings, to inspire men with a scorn of mere
temporal advantage, to give birth to living convictions, and to keep alive the spirit of honorable
devotedness; if you hold it to be a good thing to refine the habits, to embellish the manners,
to cultivate the arts of a nation, and to promote the love of poetry, of beauty, and of renown;
if you would constitute a people not unfitted to act with power upon all other nations, nor
unprepared for those high enterprises which, whatever be the result of its efforts, will leave
a name forever famous in time--if you believe such to be the principal object of society, you
must avoid the government of democracy, which would be a very uncertain guide to the end you
have in view.

But if you hold it to be expedient to divert the moral and intellectual activity of man to
the production of comfort, and to the acquirement of the necessaries of life; if a clear understanding
be more profitable to man than genius; if your object be not to stimulate the virtues of heroism,
but to create habits of peace; if you had rather witness vices than crimes and are content
to meet with fewer noble deeds, provided offences be diminished in the same proportion; if,
instead of living in the midst of a brilliant state of society, you are contented to have prosperity
around you; if, in short, you are of opinion that the principal object of a Government is not
to confer the greatest possible share of power and of glory upon the body of the nation, but
to ensure the greatest degree of enjoyment and the least degree of misery to each of the individuals
who compose it--if such be your desires, you can have no surer means of satisfying them than
by equalizing the conditions of men, and establishing democratic institutions.

But if the time be passed at which such a choice was possible, and if some superhuman power
impel us towards one or the other of these two governments without consulting our wishes, let
us at least endeavor to make the best of that which is allotted to us; and let us so inquire
into its good and its evil propensities as to be able to foster the former and repress the
latter to the utmost.

Unlimited Power Of The Majority In The United States, And Its Consequences

The very essence of democratic government consists in the absolute sovereignty of the majority;
for there is nothing in democratic States which is capable of resisting it. Most of the American
Constitutions have sought to increase this natural strength of the majority by artificial means. *a

[Footnote a: We observed, in examining the Federal Constitution, that the efforts of the legislators
of the Union had been diametrically opposed to the present tendency. The consequence has been
that the Federal Government is more independent in its sphere than that of the States. But
the Federal Government scarcely ever interferes in any but external affairs; and the governments
of the State are in the governments of the States are in reality the authorities which direct
society in America.]

The legislature is, of all political institutions, the one which is most easily swayed by the
wishes of the majority. The Americans determined that the members of the legislature should
be elected by the people immediately, and for a very brief term, in order to subject them,
not only to the general convictions, but even to the daily passion, of their constituents.
The members of both houses are taken from the same class in society, and are nominated in the
same manner; so that the modifications of the legislative bodies are almost as rapid and quite
as irresistible as those of a single assembly. It is to a legislature thus constituted that
almost all the authority of the government has been entrusted.

But whilst the law increased the strength of those authorities which of themselves were strong,
it enfeebled more and more those which were naturally weak. It deprived the representatives
of the executive of all stability and independence, and by subjecting them completely to the
caprices of the legislature, it robbed them of the slender influence which the nature of a
democratic government might have allowed them to retain. In several States the judicial power
was also submitted to the elective discretion of the majority, and in all of them its existence
was made to depend on the pleasure of the legislative authority, since the representatives
were empowered annually to regulate the stipend of the judges.

Custom, however, has done even more than law.

Several other circumstances concur in rendering the power of the majority in America not only
preponderant, but irresistible. The moral authority of the majority is partly based upon the
notion that there is more intelligence and more wisdom in a great number of men collected together
than in a single individual, and that the quantity of legislators is more important than their
quality. The theory of equality is in fact applied to the intellect of man: and human pride
is thus assailed in its last retreat by a doctrine which the minority hesitate to admit, and
in which they very slowly concur. Like all other powers, and perhaps more than all other powers,
the authority of the many requires the sanction of time; at first it enforces obedience by
constraint, but its laws are not respected until they have long been maintained.

The right of governing society, which the majority supposes itself to derive from its superior
intelligence, was introduced into the United States by the first settlers, and this idea, which
would be sufficient of itself to create a free nation, has now been amalgamated with the manners
of the people and the minor incidents of social intercourse.

The French, under the old monarchy, held it for a maxim (which is still a fundamental principle
of the English Constitution) that the King could do no wrong; and if he did do wrong, the blame
was imputed to his advisers. This notion was highly favorable to habits of obedience, and it
enabled the subject to complain of the law without ceasing to love and honor the lawgiver.
The Americans entertain the same opinion with respect to the majority.

The moral power of the majority is founded upon yet another principle, which is, that the interests
of the many are to be preferred to those of the few. It will readily be perceived that the
respect here professed for the rights of the majority must naturally increase or diminish according
to the state of parties. "Mamma! mamma!" she cried, "God has sent me back my doves!" and her
little heart was recovered in a happiness in her inexperience she
contained had been lost now.

They had flown back to their little mistress and their home. Her doves sat on the railing of a balcony.
JOHNNY'S SONG. By strong POLLARD.

"come, forever, Johnny, sing me put the song-- sing me the song,"
said Mabel.

"i will," said Johnny, whose voice was able, "for i'm boy that is
josephine."

 But as the United States were colonized by men holding
equal rank amongst themselves, there is as yet no natural or permanent source of dissension
between the interests of its different inhabitants.

There are certain communities in which the persons who constitute the minority can never hope
to draw over the majority to their side, because they must then give up the very point which
is at issue between them. Thus, an aristocracy can never become a majority whilst it retains
its exclusive privileges, and it cannot cede its privileges without ceasing to be an aristocracy.

In the United States political questions cannot be taken up in so general and absolute a manner,
and all parties are willing to recognize the right of the majority, because they all hope to
turn those rights to their own advantage at some future time.

How The Unlimited Power Of The Majority Increases In America The Instability Of Legislation
And Administration Inherent In Democracy The Americans increase the mutability of the laws
which is inherent in democracy by changing the legislature every year, and by investing it
with unbounded authority--The same effect is produced upon the administration--In America social
amelioration is conducted more energetically but less perseveringly than in Europe.

I have already spoken of the natural defects of democratic institutions, and they all of them
increase at the exact ratio of the power of the majority. To begin with the most evident of
them all; the mutability of the laws is an evil inherent in democratic government, because
it is natural to democracies to raise men to power in very rapid succession. But this evil
is more or less sensible in proportion to the authority and the means of action which the legislature
possesses.

In America the authority exercised by the legislative bodies is supreme; nothing prevents them
from accomplishing their wishes with celerity, and with irresistible power, whilst they are
supplied by new representatives every year. That is to say, the circumstances which contribute
most powerfully to democratic instability, and which admit of the free application of caprice
to every object in the State, are here in full operation. In conformity with this principle,
America is, at the present day, the country in the world where laws last the shortest time.
Almost all the American constitutions have been amended within the course of thirty years:
there is therefore not a single American State which has not modified the principles of its
legislation in that lapse of time. As for the laws themselves, a single glance upon the archives
of the different States of the Union suffices to convince one that in America the activity
of the legislator never slackens. Not that the American democracy is naturally less stable
than any other, but that it is allowed to follow its capricious propensities in the formation
of the laws. *b

[Footnote b: The legislative acts promulgated by the State of Massachusetts alone, from the
year 1780 to the present time, already fill three stout volumes; and it must not be forgotten
that the collection to which I allude was published in 1823, when many old laws which had fallen
into disuse were omitted. The State of Massachusetts, which is not more populous than a department
of France, may be considered as the most stable, the most consistent, and the most sagacious
in its undertakings of the whole Union.]

The omnipotence of the majority, and the rapid as well as absolute manner in which its decisions
are executed in the United States, has not only the effect of rendering the law unstable, but
it exercises the same influence upon the execution of the law and the conduct of the public
administration. As the majority is the only power which it is important to court, all its projects
are taken up with the greatest ardor, but no sooner is its attention distracted than all this
ardor ceases; whilst in the free States of Europe the administration is at once independent
and secure, so that the projects of the legislature are put into execution, although its immediate
attention may be directed to other objects.

In America certain ameliorations are undertaken with much more zeal and activity than elsewhere;
in Europe the same ends are promoted by much less social effort, more continuously applied.

Some years ago several pious individuals undertook to ameliorate the condition of the prisons.
The public was excited by the statements which they put forward, and the regeneration of criminals
became a very popular undertaking. New prisons were built, and for the first time the idea
of reforming as well as of punishing the delinquent formed a part of prison discipline. But
this happy alteration, in which the public had taken so hearty an interest, and which the exertions
of the citizens had irresistibly accelerated, could not be completed in a moment. Whilst the
new penitentiaries were being erected (and it was the pleasure of the majority that they should
be terminated with all possible celerity), the old prisons existed, which still contained a
great number of offenders. These jails became more unwholesome and more corrupt in proportion
as the new establishments were beautified and improved, forming a contrast which may readily
be understood. The majority was so eagerly employed in founding the new prisons that those
which already existed were forgotten; and as the general attention was diverted to a novel
object, the care which had hitherto been bestowed upon the others ceased. The salutary regulations
of discipline were first relaxed, and afterwards broken; so that in the immediate neighborhood
of a prison which bore witness to the mild and enlightened spirit of our time, dungeons might
be met with which reminded the visitor of the barbarity of the Middle Ages.

Chapter XV: Unlimited Power Of Majority, And Its Consequences--Part II

Tyranny Of The Majority

How the principle of the sovereignty of the people is to be understood--Impossibility of conceiving
a mixed government--The sovereign power must centre somewhere--Precautions to be taken to control
its action--These precautions have not been taken in the United States--Consequences.

I hold it to be an impious and an execrable maxim that, politically speaking, a people has
a right to do whatsoever it pleases, and yet I have asserted that all authority originates
in the will of the majority. Am I then, in contradiction with myself?

A general law--which bears the name of Justice--has been made and sanctioned, not only by a
majority of this or that people, but by a majority of mankind. The rights of every people are
consequently confined within the limits of what is just. A nation may be considered in the
light of a jury which is empowered to represent society at large, and to apply the great and
general law of justice. Ought such a jury, which represents society, to have more power than
the society in which the laws it applies originate?

When I refuse to obey an unjust law, I do not contest the right which the majority has of commanding,
but I simply appeal from the sovereignty of the people to the sovereignty of mankind. It has
been asserted that a people can never entirely outstep the boundaries of justice and of reason
in those affairs which are more peculiarly its own, and that consequently, full power may fearlessly
be given to the majority by which it is represented. But this language is that of a slave.

A majority taken collectively may be regarded as a being whose opinions, and most frequently
whose interests, are opposed to those of another being, which is styled a minority. If it be
admitted that a man, possessing absolute power, may misuse that power by wronging his adversaries,
why should a majority not be liable to the same reproach? Men are not apt to change their characters
by agglomeration; nor does their patience in the presence of obstacles increase with the consciousness
of their strength. *c And for these reasons I can never willingly invest any number of my fellow-creatures
with that unlimited authority which I should refuse to any one of them.

[Footnote c: No one will assert that a people cannot forcibly wrong another people; but parties
may be looked upon as lesser nations within a greater one, and they are aliens to each other:
if, therefore, it be admitted that a nation can act tyrannically towards another nation, it
cannot be denied that a party may do the same towards another party.]

I do not think that it is possible to combine several principles in the same government, so
as at the same time to maintain freedom, and really to oppose them to one another. The form
of government which is usually termed mixed has always appeared to me to be a mere chimera.
Accurately speaking there is no such thing as a mixed government (with the meaning usually
given to that word), because in all communities some one principle of action may be discovered
which preponderates over the others. England in the last century, which has been more especially
cited as an example of this form of Government, was in point of fact an essentially aristocratic
State, although it comprised very powerful elements of democracy; for the laws and customs
of the country were such that the aristocracy could not but preponderate in the end, and subject
the direction of public affairs to its own will. The error arose from too much attention being
paid to the actual struggle which was going on between the nobles and the people, without considering
the probable issue of the contest, which was in reality the important point. When a community
really has a mixed government, that is to say, when it is equally divided between two adverse
principles, it must either pass through a revolution or fall into complete dissolution.

I am therefore of opinion that some one social power must always be made to predominate over
the others; but I think that liberty is endangered when this power is checked by no obstacles
which may retard its course, and force it to moderate its own vehemence.

Unlimited power is in itself a bad and dangerous thing; human beings are not competent to exercise
it with discretion, and God alone can be omnipotent, because His wisdom and His justice are
always equal to His power. But no power upon earth is so worthy of honor for itself, or of
reverential obedience to the rights which it represents, that I would consent to admit its
uncontrolled and all-predominant authority. When I see that the right and the means of absolute
command are conferred on a people or upon a king, upon an aristocracy or a democracy, a monarchy
or a republic, I recognize the germ of tyranny, and I journey onward to a land of more hopeful
institutions.

In my opinion the main evil of the present democratic institutions of the United States does
not arise, as is often asserted in Europe, from their weakness, but from their overpowering
strength; and I am not so much alarmed at the excessive liberty which reigns in that country
as at the very inadequate securities which exist against tyranny.

When an individual or a party is wronged in the United States, to whom can he apply for redress?
If to public opinion, public opinion constitutes the majority; if to the legislature, it represents
the majority, and implicitly obeys its injunctions; if to the executive power, it is appointed
by the majority, and remains a passive tool in its hands; the public troops consist of the
majority under arms; the jury is the majority invested with the right of hearing judicial cases;
and in certain States even the judges are elected by the majority. However iniquitous or absurd
the evil of which you complain may be, you must submit to it as well as you can.

I said one day to an inhabitant of Pennsylvania, "Be so good as to explain to me how it happens
that in a State founded by Quakers, and celebrated for its toleration, freed blacks are not
allowed to exercise civil rights. They pay the taxes; is it not fair that they should have a vote?"

"You insult us," replied my informant, "if you imagine that our legislators could have committed
so gross an act of injustice and intolerance."

"What! then the blacks possess the right of voting in this county?"

"Without the smallest doubt."

"How comes it, then, that at the polling-booth this morning I did not perceive a single negro
in the whole meeting?"

"This is not the fault of the law: the negroes have an undisputed right of voting, but they
voluntarily abstain from making their appearance."

"A very pretty piece of modesty on their parts!" rejoined I.

"Why, the truth is, that they are not disinclined to vote, but they are afraid of being maltreated;
in this country the law is sometimes unable to maintain its authority without the support of
the majority. But in this case the majority entertains very strong prejudices against the blacks,
and the magistrates are unable to protect them in the exercise of their legal privileges."

"What! then the majority claims the right not only of making the laws, but of breaking the
laws it has made?"]

If, on the other hand, a legislative power could be so constituted as to represent the majority
without necessarily being the slave of its passions; an executive, so as to retain a certain
degree of uncontrolled authority; and a judiciary, so as to remain independent of the two other
powers; a government would be formed which would still be democratic without incurring any
risk of tyrannical abuse.

I do not say that tyrannical abuses frequently occur in America at the present day, but I maintain
that no sure barrier is established against them, and that the causes which mitigate the government
are to be found in the circumstances and the manners of the country more than in its laws.

Effects Of The Unlimited Power Of The Majority Upon The Arbitrary Authority Of The American
Public Officers

Liberty left by the American laws to public officers within a certain sphere--Their power.

A distinction must be drawn between tyranny and arbitrary power. Tyranny may be exercised by
means of the law, and in that case it is not arbitrary; arbitrary power may be exercised for
the good of the community at large, in which case it is not tyrannical. Tyranny usually employs
arbitrary means, but, if necessary, it can rule without them.

In the United States the unbounded power of the majority, which is favorable to the legal despotism
of the legislature, is likewise favorable to the arbitrary authority of the magistrate. The
majority has an entire control over the law when it is made and when it is executed; and as
it possesses an equal authority over those who are in power and the community at large, it
considers public officers as its passive agents, and readily confides the task of serving its
designs to their vigilance. The details of their office and the privileges which they are to
enjoy are rarely defined beforehand; but the majority treats them as a master does his servants
when they are always at work in his sight, and he has the power of directing or reprimanding
them at every instant.

In general the American functionaries are far more independent than the French civil officers
within the sphere which is prescribed to them. Sometimes, even, they are allowed by the popular
authority to exceed those bounds; and as they are protected by the opinion, and backed by the
co-operation, of the majority, they venture upon such manifestations of their power as astonish
a European. By this means habits are formed in the heart of a free country which may some day
prove fatal to its liberties.

Power Exercised By The Majority In America Upon Opinion

In America, when the majority has once irrevocably decided a question, all discussion ceases--Reason
of this--Moral power exercised by the majority upon opinion--Democratic republics have deprived
despotism of its physical instruments--Their despotism sways the minds of men.

It is in the examination of the display of public opinion in the United States that we clearly
perceive how far the power of the majority surpasses all the powers with which we are acquainted
in Europe. Intellectual principles exercise an influence which is so invisible, and often so
inappreciable, that they baffle the toils of oppression. At the present time the most absolute
monarchs in Europe are unable to prevent certain notions, which are opposed to their authority,
from circulating in secret throughout their dominions, and even in their courts. Such is not
the case in America; as long as the majority is still undecided, discussion is carried on;
but as soon as its decision is irrevocably pronounced, a submissive silence is observed, and
the friends, as well as the opponents, of the measure unite in assenting to its propriety.
The reason of this is perfectly clear: no monarch is so absolute as to combine all the powers
of society in his own hands, and to conquer all opposition with the energy of a majority which
is invested with the right of making and of executing the laws.

The authority of a king is purely physical, and it controls the actions of the subject without
subduing his private will; but the majority possesses a power which is physical and moral at
the same time; it acts upon the will as well as upon the actions of men, and it represses not
only all contest, but all controversy. I know no country in which there is so little true independence
of mind and freedom of discussion as in America. In any constitutional state in Europe every
sort of religious and political theory may be advocated and propagated abroad; for there is
no country in Europe so subdued by any single authority as not to contain citizens who are
ready to protect the man who raises his voice in the cause of truth from the consequences of
his hardihood. If he is unfortunate enough to live under an absolute government, the people
is upon his side; if he inhabits a free country, he may find a shelter behind the authority
of the throne, if he require one. The aristocratic part of society supports him in some countries,
and the democracy in others. But in a nation where democratic institutions exist, organized
like those of the United States, there is but one sole authority, one single element of strength
and of success, with nothing beyond it.

In America the majority raises very formidable barriers to the liberty of opinion: within these
barriers an author may write whatever he pleases, but he will repent it if he ever step beyond
them. Not that he is exposed to the terrors of an auto-da-fe, but he is tormented by the slights
and persecutions of daily obloquy. His political career is closed forever, since he has offended
the only authority which is able to promote his success. Every sort of compensation, even that
of celebrity, is refused to him. Before he published his opinions he imagined that he held
them in common with many others; but no sooner has he declared them openly than he is loudly
censured by his overbearing opponents, whilst those who think without having the courage to
speak, like him, abandon him in silence. He yields at length, oppressed by the daily efforts
he has been making, and he subsides into silence, as if he was tormented by remorse for having
spoken the truth.

Fetters and headsmen were the coarse instruments which tyranny formerly employed; but the civilization
of our age has refined the arts of despotism which seemed, however, to have been sufficiently
perfected before. The excesses of monarchical power had devised a variety of physical means
of oppression: the democratic republics of the present day have rendered it as entirely an
affair of the mind as that will which it is intended to coerce. Under the absolute sway of
an individual despot the body was attacked in order to subdue the soul, and the soul escaped
the blows which were directed against it and rose superior to the attempt; but such is not
the course adopted by tyranny in democratic republics; there the body is left free, and the
soul is enslaved. The sovereign can no longer say, "You shall think as I do on pain of death;"
but he says, "You are free to think differently from me, and to retain your life, your property,
and all that you possess; but if such be your determination, you are henceforth an alien among
your people. You may retain your civil rights, but they will be useless to you, for you will
never be chosen by your fellow-citizens if you solicit their suffrages, and they will affect
to scorn you if you solicit their esteem. You will remain among men, but you will be deprived
of the rights of mankind. Your fellow-creatures will shun you like an impure being, and those
who are most persuaded of your innocence will abandon you too, lest they should be shunned
in their turn. Go in peace! I have given you your life, but it is an existence in comparably
worse than death."

Monarchical institutions have thrown an odium upon despotism; let us beware lest democratic
republics should restore oppression, and should render it less odious and less degrading in
the eyes of the many, by making it still more onerous to the few.

Works have been published in the proudest nations of the Old World expressly intended to censure
the vices and deride the follies of the times; Labruyere inhabited the palace of Louis XIV
when he composed his chapter upon the Great, and Moliere criticised the courtiers in the very
pieces which were acted before the Court. But the ruling power in the United States is not
to be made game of; the smallest reproach irritates its sensibility, and the slightest joke
which has any foundation in truth renders it indignant; from the style of its language to the
more solid virtues of its character, everything must be made the subject of encomium. No writer,
whatever be his eminence, can escape from this tribute of adulation to his fellow-citizens.
The majority lives in the perpetual practice of self-applause, and there are certain truths
which the Americans can only learn from strangers or from experience.

If great writers have not at present existed in America, the reason is very simply given in
these facts; there can be no literary genius without freedom of opinion, and freedom of opinion
does not exist in America. The Inquisition has never been able to prevent a vast number of
anti-religious books from circulating in Spain. The empire of the majority succeeds much better
in the United States, since it actually removes the wish of publishing them. Unbelievers are
to be met with in America, but, to say the truth, there is no public organ of infidelity. Attempts
have been made by some governments to protect the morality of nations by prohibiting licentious
books. In the United States no one is punished for this sort of works, but no one is induced
to write them; not because all the citizens are immaculate in their manners, but because the
majority of the community is decent and orderly.

In these cases the advantages derived from the exercise of this power are unquestionable, and
I am simply discussing the nature of the power itself. This irresistible authority is a constant
fact, and its judicious exercise is an accidental occurrence.

Effects Of The Tyranny Of The Majority Upon The National Character Of The Americans

Effects of the tyranny of the majority more sensibly felt hitherto in the manners than in the
conduct of society--They check the development of leading characters--Democratic republics
organized like the United States bring the practice of courting favor within the reach of the
many--Proofs of this spirit in the United States--Why there is more patriotism in the people
than in those who govern in its name.

The tendencies which I have just alluded to are as yet very slightly perceptible in political
society, but they already begin to exercise an unfavorable influence upon the national character
of the Americans. I am inclined to attribute the singular paucity of distinguished political
characters to the ever-increasing activity of the despotism of the majority in the United States.

In absolute governments the great nobles who are nearest to the throne flatter the passions
of the sovereign, and voluntarily truckle to his caprices. But the mass of the nation does
not degrade itself by servitude: it often submits from weakness, from habit, or from ignorance,
and sometimes from loyalty. Some nations have been known to sacrifice their own desires to
those of the sovereign with pleasure and with pride, thus exhibiting a sort of independence
in the very act of submission. These peoples are miserable, but they are not degraded. There
is a great difference between doing what one does not approve and feigning to approve what
one does; the one is the necessary case of a weak person, the other befits the temper of a lackey.

In free countries, where everyone is more or less called upon to give his opinion in the affairs
of state; in democratic republics, where public life is incessantly commingled with domestic
affairs, where the sovereign authority is accessible on every side, and where its attention
can almost always be attracted by vociferation, more persons are to be met with who speculate
upon its foibles and live at the cost of its passions than in absolute monarchies. Not because
men are naturally worse in these States than elsewhere, but the temptation is stronger, and
of easier access at the same time. The result is a far more extensive debasement of the characters
of citizens.

If ever these lines are read in America, I am well assured of two things: in the first place,
that all who peruse them will raise their voices to condemn me; and in the second place, that
very many of them will acquit me at the bottom of their conscience.

I have heard of patriotism in the United States, and it is a virtue which may be found among
the people, but never among the leaders of the people. This may be explained by analogy; despotism
debases the oppressed much more than the oppressor: in absolute monarchies the king has often
great virtues, but the courtiers are invariably servile. It is true that the American courtiers
do not say "Sire," or "Your Majesty"--a distinction without a difference. They are forever
talking of the natural intelligence of the populace they serve; they do not debate the question
as to which of the virtues of their master is pre-eminently worthy of admiration, for they
assure him that he possesses all the virtues under heaven without having acquired them, or
without caring to acquire them; they do not give him their daughters and their wives to be
raised at his pleasure to the rank of his concubines, but, by sacrificing their opinions, they
prostitute themselves. Moralists and philosophers in America are not obliged to conceal their
opinions under the veil of allegory; but, before they venture upon a harsh truth, they say,
"We are aware that the people which we are addressing is too superior to all the weaknesses
of human nature to lose the command of its temper for an instant; and we should not hold this
language if we were not speaking to men whom their virtues and their intelligence render more
worthy of freedom than all the rest of the world." It would have been impossible for the sycophants
of Louis XIV to flatter more dexterously. For my part, I am persuaded that in all governments,
whatever their nature may be, servility will cower to force, and adulation will cling to power.
The only means of preventing men from degrading themselves is to invest no one with that unlimited
authority which is the surest method of debasing them.

The Greatest Dangers Of The American Republics Proceed From The Unlimited Power Of The Majority

Democratic republics liable to perish from a misuse of their power, and not by impotence--The
Governments of the American republics are more centralized and more energetic than those of
the monarchies of Europe--Dangers resulting from this--Opinions of Hamilton and Jefferson upon
this point.

Governments usually fall a sacrifice to impotence or to tyranny. In the former case their power
escapes from them; it is wrested from their grasp in the latter. Many observers, who have witnessed
the anarchy of democratic States, have imagined that the government of those States was naturally
weak and impotent. The truth is, that when once hostilities are begun between parties, the
government loses its control over society. But I do not think that a democratic power is naturally
without force or without resources: say, rather, that it is almost always by the abuse of its
force and the misemployment of its resources that a democratic government fails. Anarchy is
almost always produced by its tyranny or its mistakes, but not by its want of strength.

It is important not to confound stability with force, or the greatness of a thing with its
duration. In democratic republics, the power which directs *e society is not stable; for it
often changes hands and assumes a new direction. But whichever way it turns, its force is almost
irresistible. The Governments of the American republics appear to me to be as much centralized
as those of the absolute monarchies of Europe, and more energetic than they are. I do not,
therefore, imagine that they will perish from weakness. *f

[Footnote e: This power may be centred in an assembly, in which case it will be strong without
being stable; or it may be centred in an individual, in which case it will be less strong,
but more stable.]

[Footnote f: I presume that it is scarcely necessary to remind the reader here, as well as
throughout the remainder of this chapter, that I am speaking, not of the Federal Government,
but of the several governments of each State, which the majority controls at its pleasure.]

If ever the free institutions of America are destroyed, that event may be attributed to the
unlimited authority of the majority, which may at some future time urge the minorities to desperation,
and oblige them to have recourse to physical force. Anarchy will then be the result, but it
will have been brought about by despotism.

Mr. Hamilton expresses the same opinion in the "Federalist," No. 51. "It is of great importance
in a republic not only to guard the society against the oppression of its rulers, but to guard
one part of the society against the injustice of the other part. Justice is the end of government.
It is the end of civil society. It ever has been, and ever will be, pursued until it be obtained,
or until liberty be lost in the pursuit. In a society, under the forms of which the stronger
faction can readily unite and oppress the weaker, anarchy may as truly be said to reign as
in a state of nature, where the weaker individual is not secured against the violence of the
stronger: and as in the latter state even the stronger individuals are prompted by the uncertainty
of their condition to submit to a government which may protect the weak as well as themselves,
so in the former state will the more powerful factions be gradually induced by a like motive
to wish for a government which will protect all parties, the weaker as well as the more powerful.
It can be little doubted that, if the State of Rhode Island was separated from the Confederacy
and left to itself, the insecurity of right under the popular form of government within such
narrow limits would be displayed by such reiterated oppressions of the factious majorities,
that some power altogether independent of the people would soon be called for by the voice
of the very factions whose misrule had proved the necessity of it."

Jefferson has also thus expressed himself in a letter to Madison: *g "The executive power in
our Government is not the only, perhaps not even the principal, object of my solicitude. The
tyranny of the Legislature is really the danger most to be feared, and will continue to be
so for many years to come. The tyranny of the executive power will come in its turn, but at
a more distant period." I am glad to cite the opinion of Jefferson upon this subject rather
than that of another, because I consider him to be the most powerful advocate democracy has
ever sent forth.

[Footnote g: March 15, 1789.]

Chapter XVI: Causes Mitigating Tyranny In The United States--Part I

Chapter Summary

The national majority does not pretend to conduct all business--Is obliged to employ the town
and county magistrates to execute its supreme decisions.

I have already pointed out the distinction which is to be made between a centralized government
and a centralized administration. The former exists in America, but the latter is nearly unknown
there. If the directing power of the American communities had both these instruments of government
at its disposal, and united the habit of executing its own commands to the right of commanding;
if, after having established the general principles of government, it descended to the details
of public business; and if, having regulated the great interests of the country, it could penetrate
into the privacy of individual interests, freedom would soon be banished from the New World.

But in the United States the majority, which so frequently displays the tastes and the propensities
of a despot, is still destitute of the more perfect instruments of tyranny. In the American
republics the activity of the central Government has never as yet been extended beyond a limited
number of objects sufficiently prominent to call forth its attention. The secondary affairs
of society have never been regulated by its authority, and nothing has hitherto betrayed its
desire of interfering in them. The majority is become more and more absolute, but it has not
increased the prerogatives of the central government; those great prerogatives have been confined
to a certain sphere; and although the despotism of the majority may be galling upon one point,
it cannot be said to extend to all. However the predominant party in the nation may be carried
away by its passions, however ardent it may be in the pursuit of its projects, it cannot oblige
all the citizens to comply with its desires in the same manner and at the same time throughout
the country. When the central Government which represents that majority has issued a decree,
it must entrust the execution of its will to agents, over whom it frequently has no control,
and whom it cannot perpetually direct. The townships, municipal bodies, and counties may therefore
be looked upon as concealed break-waters, which check or part the tide of popular excitement.
If an oppressive law were passed, the liberties of the people would still be protected by the
means by which that law would be put in execution: the majority cannot descend to the details
and (as I will venture to style them) the puerilities of administrative tyranny. Nor does the
people entertain that full consciousness of its authority which would prompt it to interfere
in these matters; it knows the extent of its natural powers, but it is unacquainted with the
increased resources which the art of government might furnish.

This point deserves attention, for if a democratic republic similar to that of the United States
were ever founded in a country where the power of a single individual had previously subsisted,
and the effects of a centralized administration had sunk deep into the habits and the laws
of the people, I do not hesitate to assert, that in that country a more insufferable despotism
would prevail than any which now exists in the monarchical States of Europe, or indeed than
any which could be found on this side of the confines of Asia.

The Profession Of The Law In The United States Serves To Counterpoise The Democracy

Utility of discriminating the natural propensities of the members of the legal profession--These
men called upon to act a prominent part in future society--In what manner the peculiar pursuits
of lawyers give an aristocratic turn to their ideas--Accidental causes which may check this
tendency--Ease with which the aristocracy coalesces with legal men--Use of lawyers to a despot--The
profession of the law constitutes the only aristocratic element with which the natural elements
of democracy will combine--Peculiar causes which tend to give an aristocratic turn of mind
to the English and American lawyers--The aristocracy of America is on the bench and at the
bar--Influence of lawyers upon American society--Their peculiar magisterial habits affect the
legislature, the administration, and even the people.

In visiting the Americans and in studying their laws we perceive that the authority they have
entrusted to members of the legal profession, and the influence which these individuals exercise
in the Government, is the most powerful existing security against the excesses of democracy.
This effect seems to me to result from a general cause which it is useful to investigate, since
it may produce analogous consequences elsewhere.

The members of the legal profession have taken an important part in all the vicissitudes of
political society in Europe during the last five hundred years. At one time they have been
the instruments of those who were invested with political authority, and at another they have
succeeded in converting political authorities into their instrument. In the Middle Ages they
afforded a powerful support to the Crown, and since that period they have exerted themselves
to the utmost to limit the royal prerogative. In England they have contracted a close alliance
with the aristocracy; in France they have proved to be the most dangerous enemies of that class.
It is my object to inquire whether, under all these circumstances, the members of the legal
profession have been swayed by sudden and momentary impulses; or whether they have been impelled
by principles which are inherent in their pursuits, and which will always recur in history.
I am incited to this investigation by reflecting that this particular class of men will most
likely play a prominent part in that order of things to which the events of our time are giving
birth.

Men who have more especially devoted themselves to legal pursuits derive from those occupations
certain habits of order, a taste for formalities, and a kind of instinctive regard for the
regular connection of ideas, which naturally render them very hostile to the revolutionary
spirit and the unreflecting passions of the multitude.

The special information which lawyers derive from their studies ensures them a separate station
in society, and they constitute a sort of privileged body in the scale of intelligence. This
notion of their superiority perpetually recurs to them in the practice of their profession:
they are the masters of a science which is necessary, but which is not very generally known;
they serve as arbiters between the citizens; and the habit of directing the blind passions
of parties in litigation to their purpose inspires them with a certain contempt for the judgment
of the multitude. To this it may be added that they naturally constitute a body, not by any
previous understanding, or by an agreement which directs them to a common end; but the analogy
of their studies and the uniformity of their proceedings connect their minds together, as much
as a common interest could combine their endeavors.

A portion of the tastes and of the habits of the aristocracy may consequently be discovered
in the characters of men in the profession of the law. They participate in the same instinctive
love of order and of formalities; and they entertain the same repugnance to the actions of
the multitude, and the same secret contempt of the government of the people. I do not mean
to say that the natural propensities of lawyers are sufficiently strong to sway them irresistibly;
for they, like most other men, are governed by their private interests and the advantages of
the moment.

In a state of society in which the members of the legal profession are prevented from holding
that rank in the political world which they enjoy in private life, we may rest assured that
they will be the foremost agents of revolution. But it must then be inquired whether the cause
which induces them to innovate and to destroy is accidental, or whether it belongs to some
lasting purpose which they entertain. It is true that lawyers mainly contributed to the overthrow
of the French monarchy in 1789; but it remains to be seen whether they acted thus because they
had studied the laws, or because they were prohibited from co-operating in the work of legislation.

Five hundred years ago the English nobles headed the people, and spoke in its name; at the
present time the aristocracy supports the throne, and defends the royal prerogative. But aristocracy
has, notwithstanding this, its peculiar instincts and propensities. We must be careful not
to confound isolated members of a body with the body itself. In all free governments, of whatsoever
form they may be, members of the legal profession will be found at the head of all parties.
The same remark is also applicable to the aristocracy; for almost all the democratic convulsions
which have agitated the world have been directed by nobles.

A privileged body can never satisfy the ambition of all its members; it has always more talents
and more passions to content and to employ than it can find places; so that a considerable
number of individuals are usually to be met with who are inclined to attack those very privileges
which they find it impossible to turn to their own account.

I do not, then, assert that all the members of the legal profession are at all times the friends
of order and the opponents of innovation, but merely that most of them usually are so. In a
community in which lawyers are allowed to occupy, without opposition, that high station which
naturally belongs to them, their general spirit will be eminently conservative and anti-democratic.
When an aristocracy excludes the leaders of that profession from its ranks, it excites enemies
which are the more formidable to its security as they are independent of the nobility by their
industrious pursuits; and they feel themselves to be its equal in point of intelligence, although
they enjoy less opulence and less power. But whenever an aristocracy consents to impart some
of its privileges to these same individuals, the two classes coalesce very readily, and assume,
as it were, the consistency of a single order of family interests.

I am, in like manner, inclined to believe that a monarch will always be able to convert legal
practitioners into the most serviceable instruments of his authority. There is a far greater
affinity between this class of individuals and the executive power than there is between them
and the people; just as there is a greater natural affinity between the nobles and the monarch
than between the nobles and the people, although the higher orders of society have occasionally
resisted the prerogative of the Crown in concert with the lower classes.

Lawyers are attached to public order beyond every other consideration, and the best security
of public order is authority. It must not be forgotten that, if they prize the free institutions
of their country much, they nevertheless value the legality of those institutions far more:
they are less afraid of tyranny than of arbitrary power; and provided that the legislature
take upon itself to deprive men of their independence, they are not dissatisfied.

I am therefore convinced that the prince who, in presence of an encroaching democracy, should
endeavor to impair the judicial authority in his dominions, and to diminish the political influence
of lawyers, would commit a great mistake. He would let slip the substance of authority to grasp
at the shadow. He would act more wisely in introducing men connected with the law into the
government; and if he entrusted them with the conduct of a despotic power, bearing some marks
of violence, that power would most likely assume the external features of justice and of legality
in their hands.

The government of democracy is favorable to the political power of lawyers; for when the wealthy,
the noble, and the prince are excluded from the government, they are sure to occupy the highest
stations, in their own right, as it were, since they are the only men of information and sagacity,
beyond the sphere of the people, who can be the object of the popular choice. If, then, they
are led by their tastes to combine with the aristocracy and to support the Crown, they are
naturally brought into contact with the people by their interests. They like the government
of democracy, without participating in its propensities and without imitating its weaknesses;
whence they derive a twofold authority, from it and over it. The people in democratic states
does not mistrust the members of the legal profession, because it is well known that they are
interested in serving the popular cause; and it listens to them without irritation, because
it does not attribute to them any sinister designs. The object of lawyers is not, indeed, to
overthrow the institutions of democracy, but they constantly endeavor to give it an impulse
which diverts it from its real tendency, by means which are foreign to its nature. Lawyers
belong to the people by birth and interest, to the aristocracy by habit and by taste, and they
may be looked upon as the natural bond and connecting link of the two great classes of society.

The profession of the law is the only aristocratic element which can be amalgamated without
violence with the natural elements of democracy, and which can be advantageously and permanently
combined with them. I am not unacquainted with the defects which are inherent in the character
of that body of men; but without this admixture of lawyer-like sobriety with the democratic
principle, I question whether democratic institutions could long be maintained, and I cannot
believe that a republic could subsist at the present time if the influence of lawyers in public
business did not increase in proportion to the power of the people.

This aristocratic character, which I hold to be common to the legal profession, is much more
distinctly marked in the United States and in England than in any other country. This proceeds
not only from the legal studies of the English and American lawyers, but from the nature of
the legislation, and the position which those persons occupy in the two countries. The English
and the Americans have retained the law of precedents; that is to say, they continue to found
their legal opinions and the decisions of their courts upon the opinions and the decisions
of their forefathers. In the mind of an English or American lawyer a taste and a reverence
for what is old is almost always united to a love of regular and lawful proceedings.

This predisposition has another effect upon the character of the legal profession and upon
the general course of society. The English and American lawyers investigate what has been done;
the French advocate inquires what should have been done; the former produce precedents, the
latter reasons. A French observer is surprised to hear how often an English dr an American
lawyer quotes the opinions of others, and how little he alludes to his own; whilst the reverse
occurs in France. There the most trifling litigation is never conducted without the introduction
of an entire system of ideas peculiar to the counsel employed; and the fundamental principles
of law are discussed in order to obtain a perch of land by the decision of the court. This
abnegation of his own opinion, and this implicit deference to the opinion of his forefathers,
which are common to the English and American lawyer, this subjection of thought which he is
obliged to profess, necessarily give him more timid habits and more sluggish inclinations in
England and America than in France.

The French codes are often difficult of comprehension, but they can be read by every one; nothing,
on the other hand, can be more impenetrable to the uninitiated than a legislation founded upon
precedents. The indispensable want of legal assistance which is felt in England and in the
United States, and the high opinion which is generally entertained of the ability of the legal
profession, tend to separate it more and more from the people, and to place it in a distinct
class. The French lawyer is simply a man extensively acquainted with the statutes of his country;
but the English or American lawyer resembles the hierophants of Egypt, for, like them, he is
the sole interpreter of an occult science.

The station which lawyers occupy in England and America exercises no less an influence upon
their habits and their opinions. The English aristocracy, which has taken care to attract to
its sphere whatever is at all analogous to itself, has conferred a high degree of importance
and of authority upon the members of the legal profession. In English society lawyers do not
occupy the first rank, but they are contented with the station assigned to them; they constitute,
as it were, the younger branch of the English aristocracy, and they are attached to their elder
brothers, although they do not enjoy all their privileges. The English lawyers consequently
mingle the taste and the ideas of the aristocratic circles in which they move with the aristocratic
interests of their profession.

And indeed the lawyer-like character which I am endeavoring to depict is most distinctly to
be met with in England: there laws are esteemed not so much because they are good as because
they are old; and if it be necessary to modify them in any respect, or to adapt them the changes
which time operates in society, recourse is had to the most inconceivable contrivances in order
to uphold the traditionary fabric, and to maintain that nothing has been done which does not
square with the intentions and complete the labors of former generations. The very individuals
who conduct these changes disclaim all intention of innovation, and they had rather resort
to absurd expedients than plead guilty to so great a crime. This spirit appertains more especially
to the English lawyers; they seem indifferent to the real meaning of what they treat, and they
direct all their attention to the letter, seeming inclined to infringe the rules of common
sense and of humanity rather than to swerve one title from the law. The English legislation
may be compared to the stock of an old tree, upon which lawyers have engrafted the most various
shoots, with the hope that, although their fruits may differ, their foliage at least will be
confounded with the venerable trunk which supports them all.

In America there are no nobles or men of letters, and the people is apt to mistrust the wealthy;
lawyers consequently form the highest political class, and the most cultivated circle of society.
They have therefore nothing to gain by innovation, which adds a conservative interest to their
natural taste for public order. If I were asked where I place the American aristocracy, I should
reply without hesitation that it is not composed of the rich, who are united together by no
common tie, but that it occupies the judicial bench and the bar.

The more we reflect upon all that occurs in the United States the more shall we be persuaded
that the lawyers as a body form the most powerful, if not the only, counterpoise to the democratic
element. In that country we perceive how eminently the legal profession is qualified by its
powers, and even by its defects, to neutralize the vices which are inherent in popular government.
When the American people is intoxicated by passion, or carried away by the impetuosity of its
ideas, it is checked and stopped by the almost invisible influence of its legal counsellors,
who secretly oppose their aristocratic propensities to its democratic instincts, their superstitious
attachment to what is antique to its love of novelty, their narrow views to its immense designs,
and their habitual procrastination to its ardent impatience.

The courts of justice are the most visible organs by which the legal profession is enabled
to control the democracy. The judge is a lawyer, who, independently of the taste for regularity
and order which he has contracted in the study of legislation, derives an additional love of
stability from his own inalienable functions. His legal attainments have already raised him
to a distinguished rank amongst his fellow-citizens; his political power completes the distinction
of his station, and gives him the inclinations natural to privileged classes.

Armed with the power of declaring the laws to be unconstitutional, *a the American magistrate
perpetually interferes in political affairs. He cannot force the people to make laws, but at
least he can oblige it not to disobey its own enactments; or to act inconsistently with its
own principles. I am aware that a secret tendency to diminish the judicial power exists in
the United States, and by most of the constitutions of the several States the Government can,
upon the demand of the two houses of the legislature, remove the judges from their station.
By some other constitutions the members of the tribunals are elected, and they are even subjected
to frequent re-elections. I venture to predict that these innovations will sooner or later
be attended with fatal consequences, and that it will be found out at some future period that
the attack which is made upon the judicial power has affected the democratic republic itself.

[Footnote a: See chapter VI. on the "Judicial Power in the United States."]

It must not, however, be supposed that the legal spirit of which I have been speaking has been
confined, in the United States, to the courts of justice; it extends far beyond them. As the
lawyers constitute the only enlightened class which the people does not mistrust, they are
naturally called upon to occupy most of the public stations. They fill the legislative assemblies,
and they conduct the administration; they consequently exercise a powerful influence upon the
formation of the law, and upon its execution. The lawyers are, however, obliged to yield to
the current of public opinion, which is too strong for them to resist it, but it is easy to
find indications of what their conduct would be if they were free to act as they chose. The
Americans, who have made such copious innovations in their political legislation, have introduced
very sparing alterations in their civil laws, and that with great difficulty, although those
laws are frequently repugnant to their social condition. The reason of this is, that in matters
of civil law the majority is obliged to defer to the authority of the legal profession, and
that the American lawyers are disinclined to innovate when they are left to their own choice.

It is curious for a Frenchman, accustomed to a very different state of things, to hear the
perpetual complaints which are made in the United States against the stationary propensities
of legal men, and their prejudices in favor of existing institutions.

The influence of the legal habits which are common in America extends beyond the limits I have
just pointed out. Scarcely any question arises in the United States which does not become,
sooner or later, a subject of judicial debate; hence all parties are obliged to borrow the
ideas, and even the language, usual in judicial proceedings in their daily controversies. As
most public men are, or have been, legal practitioners, they introduce the customs and technicalities
of their profession into the affairs of the country. The jury extends this habitude to all
classes. The language of the law thus becomes, in some measure, a vulgar tongue; the spirit
of the law, which is produced in the schools and courts of justice, gradually penetrates beyond
their walls into the bosom of society, where it descends to the lowest classes, so that the
whole people contracts the habits and the tastes of the magistrate. The lawyers of the United
States form a party which is but little feared and scarcely perceived, which has no badge peculiar
to itself, which adapts itself with great flexibility to the exigencies of the time, and accommodates
itself to all the movements of the social body; but this party extends over the whole community,
and it penetrates into all classes of society; it acts upon the country imperceptibly, but
it finally fashions it to suit its purposes.

Trial By Jury In The United States Considered As A Political Institution

Trial by jury, which is one of the instruments of the sovereignty of the people, deserves to
be compared with the other laws which establish that sovereignty--Composition of the jury in
the United States--Effect of trial by jury upon the national character--It educates the people--It
tends to establish the authority of the magistrates and to extend a knowledge of law among
the people.

Since I have been led by my subject to recur to the administration of justice in the United
States, I will not pass over this point without adverting to the institution of the jury. Trial
by jury may be considered in two separate points of view, as a judicial and as a political
institution. If it entered into my present purpose to inquire how far trial by jury (more especially
in civil cases) contributes to insure the best administration of justice, I admit that its
utility might be contested. As the jury was first introduced at a time when society was in
an uncivilized state, and when courts of justice were merely called upon to decide on the evidence
of facts, it is not an easy task to adapt it to the wants of a highly civilized community when
the mutual relations of men are multiplied to a surprising extent, and have assumed the enlightened
and intellectual character of the age. *b

[Footnote b: The investigation of trial by jury as a judicial institution, and the appreciation
of its effects in the United States, together with the advantages the Americans have derived
from it, would suffice to form a book, and a book upon a very useful and curious subject. The
State of Louisiana would in particular afford the curious phenomenon of a French and English
legislation, as well as a French and English population, which are gradually combining with
each other. See the "Digeste des Lois de la Louisiane," in two volumes; and the "Traite sur
les Regles des Actions civiles," printed in French and English at New Orleans in 1830.]

My present object is to consider the jury as a political institution, and any other course
would divert me from my subject. Of trial by jury, considered as a judicial institution, I
shall here say but very few words. When the English adopted trial by jury they were a semi-barbarous
people; they are become, in course of time, one of the most enlightened nations of the earth;
and their attachment to this institution seems to have increased with their increasing cultivation.
They soon spread beyond their insular boundaries to every corner of the habitable globe; some
have formed colonies, others independent states; the mother-country has maintained its monarchical
constitution; many of its offspring have founded powerful republics; but wherever the English
have been they have boasted of the privilege of trial by jury. *c They have established it,
or hastened to re-establish it, in all their settlements. A judicial institution which obtains
the suffrages of a great people for so long a series of ages, which is zealously renewed at
every epoch of civilization, in all the climates of the earth and under every form of human
government, cannot be contrary to the spirit of justice. *d

[Footnote c: All the English and American jurists are unanimous upon this head. Mr. Story,
judge of the Supreme Court of the United States, speaks, in his "Treatise on the Federal Constitution,"
of the advantages of trial by jury in civil cases:--"The inestimable privilege of a trial by
jury in civil cases--a privilege scarcely inferior to that in criminal cases, which is counted
by all persons to be essential to political and civil liberty. . . ." (Story, book iii., chap.
xxxviii.)]

[Footnote d: If it were our province to point out the utility of the jury as a judicial institution
in this place, much might be said, and the following arguments might be brought forward amongst
others:--

By introducing the jury into the business of the courts you are enabled to diminish the number
of judges, which is a very great advantage. When judges are very numerous, death is perpetually
thinning the ranks of the judicial functionaries, and laying places vacant for newcomers. The
ambition of the magistrates is therefore continually excited, and they are naturally made dependent
upon the will of the majority, or the individual who fills up the vacant appointments; the
officers of the court then rise like the officers of an army. This state of things is entirely
contrary to the sound administration of justice, and to the intentions of the legislator. The
office of a judge is made inalienable in order that he may remain independent: but of what
advantage is it that his independence should be protected if he be tempted to sacrifice it
of his own accord? When judges are very numerous many of them must necessarily be incapable
of performing their important duties, for a great magistrate is a man of no common powers;
and I am inclined to believe that a half-enlightened tribunal is the worst of all instruments
for attaining those objects which it is the purpose of courts of justice to accomplish. For
my own part, I had rather submit the decision of a case to ignorant jurors directed by a skilful
judge than to judges a majority of whom are imperfectly acquainted with jurisprudence and with
the laws.]

I turn, however, from this part of the subject. To look upon the jury as a mere judicial institution
is to confine our attention to a very narrow view of it; for however great its influence may
be upon the decisions of the law courts, that influence is very subordinate to the powerful
effects which it produces on the destinies of the community at large. The jury is above all
a political institution, and it must be regarded in this light in order to be duly appreciated.

By the jury I mean a certain number of citizens chosen indiscriminately, and invested with
a temporary right of judging. Trial by jury, as applied to the repression of crime, appears
to me to introduce an eminently republican element into the government upon the following grounds:--

The institution of the jury may be aristocratic or democratic, according to the class of society
from which the jurors are selected; but it always preserves its republican character, inasmuch
as it places the real direction of society in the hands of the governed, or of a portion of
the governed, instead of leaving it under the authority of the Government. Force is never more
than a transient element of success; and after force comes the notion of right. A government
which should only be able to crush its enemies upon a field of battle would very soon be destroyed.
The true sanction of political laws is to be found in penal legislation, and if that sanction
be wanting the law will sooner or later lose its cogency. He who punishes infractions of the
law is therefore the real master of society. Now the institution of the jury raises the people
itself, or at least a class of citizens, to the bench of judicial authority. The institution
of the jury consequently invests the people, or that class of citizens, with the direction
of society. *e

[Footnote e: An important remark must, however, be made. Trial by jury does unquestionably
invest the people with a general control over the actions of citizens, but it does not furnish
means of exercising this control in all cases, or with an absolute authority. When an absolute
monarch has the right of trying offences by his representatives, the fate of the prisoner is,
as it were, decided beforehand. But even if the people were predisposed to convict, the composition
and the non-responsibility of the jury would still afford some chances favorable to the protection
of innocence.]

In England the jury is returned from the aristocratic portion of the nation; *f the aristocracy
makes the laws, applies the laws, and punishes all infractions of the laws; everything is established
upon a consistent footing, and England may with truth be said to constitute an aristocratic
republic. In the United States the same system is applied to the whole people. Every American
citizen is qualified to be an elector, a juror, and is eligible to office. *g The system of
the jury, as it is understood in America, appears to me to be as direct and as extreme a consequence
of the sovereignty of the people as universal suffrage. These institutions are two instruments
of equal power, which contribute to the supremacy of the majority. All the sovereigns who have
chosen to govern by their own authority, and to direct society instead of obeying its directions,
have destroyed or enfeebled the institution of the jury. The monarchs of the House of Tudor
sent to prison jurors who refused to convict, and Napoleon caused them to be returned by his
agents.

[Footnote f: [This may be true to some extent of special juries, but not of common juries.
The author seems not to have been aware that the qualifications of jurors in England vary exceedingly.]]

[Footnote g: See Appendix, Q.]

However clear most of these truths may seem to be, they do not command universal assent, and
in France, at least, the institution of trial by jury is still very imperfectly understood.
If the question arises as to the proper qualification of jurors, it is confined to a discussion
of the intelligence and knowledge of the citizens who may be returned, as if the jury was merely
a judicial institution. This appears to me to be the least part of the subject. The jury is
pre-eminently a political institution; it must be regarded as one form of the sovereignty of
the people; when that sovereignty is repudiated, it must be rejected, or it must be adapted
to the laws by which that sovereignty is established. The jury is that portion of the nation
to which the execution of the laws is entrusted, as the Houses of Parliament constitute that
part of the nation which makes the laws; and in order that society may be governed with consistency
and uniformity, the list of citizens qualified to serve on juries must increase and diminish
with the list of electors. This I hold to be the point of view most worthy of the attention
of the legislator, and all that remains is merely accessory.

I am so entirely convinced that the jury is pre-eminently a political institution that I still
consider it in this light when it is applied in civil causes. Laws are always unstable unless
they are founded upon the manners of a nation; manners are the only durable and resisting power
in a people. When the jury is reserved for criminal offences, the people only witnesses its
occasional action in certain particular cases; the ordinary course of life goes on without
its interference, and it is considered as an instrument, but not as the only instrument, of
obtaining justice. This is true a fortiori when the jury is only applied to certain criminal
causes.

When, on the contrary, the influence of the jury is extended to civil causes, its application
is constantly palpable; it affects all the interests of the community; everyone co-operates
in its work: it thus penetrates into all the usages of life, it fashions the human mind to
its peculiar forms, and is gradually associated with the idea of justice itself.

The institution of the jury, if confined to criminal causes, is always in danger, but when
once it is introduced into civil proceedings it defies the aggressions of time and of man.
If it had been as easy to remove the jury from the manners as from the laws of England, it
would have perished under Henry VIII, and Elizabeth, and the civil jury did in reality, at
that period, save the liberties of the country. In whatever manner the jury be applied, it
cannot fail to exercise a powerful influence upon the national character; but this influence
is prodigiously increased when it is introduced into civil causes. The jury, and more especially
the jury in civil cases, serves to communicate the spirit of the judges to the minds of all
the citizens; and this spirit, with the habits which attend it, is the soundest preparation
for free institutions. It imbues all classes with a respect for the thing judged, and with
the notion of right. If these two elements be removed, the love of independence is reduced
to a mere destructive passion. It teaches men to practice equity, every man learns to judge
his neighbor as he would himself be judged; and this is especially true of the jury in civil
causes, for, whilst the number of persons who have reason to apprehend a criminal prosecution
is small, every one is liable to have a civil action brought against him. The jury teaches
every man not to recoil before the responsibility of his own actions, and impresses him with
that manly confidence without which political virtue cannot exist. It invests each citizen
with a kind of magistracy, it makes them all feel the duties which they are bound to discharge
towards society, and the part which they take in the Government. By obliging men to turn their
attention to affairs which are not exclusively their own, it rubs off that individual egotism
which is the rust of society.

The jury contributes most powerfully to form the judgement and to increase the natural intelligence
of a people, and this is, in my opinion, its greatest advantage. It may be regarded as a gratuitous
public school ever open, in which every juror learns to exercise his rights, enters into daily
communication with the most learned and enlightened members of the upper classes, and becomes
practically acquainted with the laws of his country, which are brought within the reach of
his capacity by the efforts of the bar, the advice of the judge, and even by the passions of
the parties. I think that the practical intelligence and political good sense of the Americans
are mainly attributable to the long use which they have made of the jury in civil causes. I
do not know whether the jury is useful to those who are in litigation; but I am certain it
is highly beneficial to those who decide the litigation; and I look upon it as one of the most
efficacious means for the education of the people which society can employ.

What I have hitherto said applies to all nations, but the remark I am now about to make is
peculiar to the Americans and to democratic peoples. I have already observed that in democracies
the members of the legal profession and the magistrates constitute the only aristocratic body
which can check the irregularities of the people. This aristocracy is invested with no physical
power, but it exercises its conservative influence upon the minds of men, and the most abundant
source of its authority is the institution of the civil jury. In criminal causes, when society
is armed against a single individual, the jury is apt to look upon the judge as the passive
instrument of social power, and to mistrust his advice. Moreover, criminal causes are entirely
founded upon the evidence of facts which common sense can readily appreciate; upon this ground
the judge and the jury are equal. Such, however, is not the case in civil causes; then the
judge appears as a disinterested arbiter between the conflicting passions of the parties. The
jurors look up to him with confidence and listen to him with respect, for in this instance
their intelligence is completely under the control of his learning. It is the judge who sums
up the various arguments with which their memory has been wearied out, and who guides them
through the devious course of the proceedings; he points their attention to the exact question
of fact which they are called upon to solve, and he puts the answer to the question of law
into their mouths. His influence upon their verdict is almost unlimited.

If I am called upon to explain why I am but little moved by the arguments derived from the
ignorance of jurors in civil causes, I reply, that in these proceedings, whenever the question
to be solved is not a mere question of fact, the jury has only the semblance of a judicial
body. The jury sanctions the decision of the judge, they by the authority of society which
they represent, and he by that of reason and of law. *h

[Footnote h: See Appendix, R.]

In England and in America the judges exercise an influence upon criminal trials which the French
judges have never possessed. The reason of this difference may easily be discovered; the English
and American magistrates establish their authority in civil causes, and only transfer it afterwards
to tribunals of another kind, where that authority was not acquired. In some cases (and they
are frequently the most important ones) the American judges have the right of deciding causes
alone. *i Upon these occasions they are accidentally placed in the position which the French
judges habitually occupy, but they are invested with far more power than the latter; they are
still surrounded by the reminiscence of the jury, and their judgment has almost as much authority
as the voice of the community at large, represented by that institution. Their influence extends
beyond the limits of the courts; in the recreations of private life as well as in the turmoil
of public business, abroad and in the legislative assemblies, the American judge is constantly
surrounded by men who are accustomed to regard his intelligence as superior to their own, and
after having exercised his power in the decision of causes, he continues to influence the habits
of thought and the characters of the individuals who took a part in his judgment.

[Footnote i: The Federal judges decide upon their own authority almost all the questions most
important to the country.]

The jury, then, which seems to restrict the rights of magistracy, does in reality consolidate
its power, and in no country are the judges so powerful as there, where the people partakes
their privileges. It is more especially by means of the jury in civil causes that the American
magistrates imbue all classes of society with the spirit of their profession. Thus the jury,
which is the most energetic means of making the people rule, is also the most efficacious means
of teaching it to rule well.

Chapter XVII: Principal Causes Maintaining The Democratic Republic--Part I

Principal Causes Which Tend To Maintain The Democratic Republic In The United States

A democratic republic subsists in the United States, and the principal object of this book
has been to account for the fact of its existence. Several of the causes which contribute to
maintain the institutions of America have been involuntarily passed by or only hinted at as
I was borne along by my subject. Others I have been unable to discuss, and those on which I
have dwelt most are, as it were, buried in the details of the former parts of this work. I
think, therefore, that before I proceed to speak of the future, I cannot do better than collect
within a small compass the reasons which best explain the present. In this retrospective chapter
I shall be succinct, for I shall take care to remind the reader very summarily of what he already
knows; and I shall only select the most prominent of those facts which I have not yet pointed out.

All the causes which contribute to the maintenance of the democratic republic in the United
States are reducible to three heads:--

I. The peculiar and accidental situation in which Providence has placed the Americans.

II. The laws.

III. The manners and customs of the people.

Accidental Or Providential Causes Which Contribute To The Maintenance Of The Democratic Republic
In The United States The Union has no neighbors--No metropolis--The Americans have had the
chances of birth in their favor--America an empty country--How this circumstance contributes
powerfully to the maintenance of the democratic republic in America--How the American wilds
are peopled--Avidity of the Anglo-Americans in taking possession of the solitudes of the New
World--Influence of physical prosperity upon the political opinions of the Americans.

A thousand circumstances, independent of the will of man, concur to facilitate the maintenance
of a democratic republic in the United States. Some of these peculiarities are known, the others
may easily be pointed out; but I shall confine myself to the most prominent amongst them.

The Americans have no neighbors, and consequently they have no great wars, or financial crises,
or inroads, or conquest to dread; they require neither great taxes, nor great armies, nor great
generals; and they have nothing to fear from a scourge which is more formidable to republics
than all these evils combined, namely, military glory. It is impossible to deny the inconceivable
influence which military glory exercises upon the spirit of a nation. General Jackson, whom
the Americans have twice elected to the head of their Government, is a man of a violent temper
and mediocre talents; no one circumstance in the whole course of his career ever proved that
he is qualified to govern a free people, and indeed the majority of the enlightened classes
of the Union has always been opposed to him. But he was raised to the Presidency, and has been
maintained in that lofty station, solely by the recollection of a victory which he gained twenty
years ago under the walls of New Orleans, a victory which was, however, a very ordinary achievement,
and which could only be remembered in a country where battles are rare. Now the people which
is thus carried away by the illusions of glory is unquestionably the most cold and calculating,
the most unmilitary (if I may use the expression), and the most prosaic of all the peoples
of the earth.

America has no great capital *a city, whose influence is directly or indirectly felt over the
whole extent of the country, which I hold to be one of the first causes of the maintenance
of republican institutions in the United States. In cities men cannot be prevented from concerting
together, and from awakening a mutual excitement which prompts sudden and passionate resolutions.
Cities may be looked upon as large assemblies, of which all the inhabitants are members; their
populace exercises a prodigious influence upon the magistrates, and frequently executes its
own wishes without their intervention.

[Footnote a: The United States have no metropolis, but they already contain several very large
cities. Philadelphia reckoned 161,000 inhabitants and New York 202,000 in the year 1830. The
lower orders which inhabit these cities constitute a rabble even more formidable than the populace
of European towns. They consist of freed blacks in the first place, who are condemned by the
laws and by public opinion to a hereditary state of misery and degradation. They also contain
a multitude of Europeans who have been driven to the shores of the New World by their misfortunes
or their misconduct; and these men inoculate the United States with all our vices, without
bringing with them any of those interests which counteract their baneful influence. As inhabitants
of a country where they have no civil rights, they are ready to turn all the passions which
agitate the community to their own advantage; thus, within the last few months serious riots
have broken out in Philadelphia and in New York. Disturbances of this kind are unknown in the
rest of the country, which is nowise alarmed by them, because the population of the cities
has hitherto exercised neither power nor influence over the rural districts. Nevertheless,
I look upon the size of certain American cities, and especially on the nature of their population,
as a real danger which threatens the future security of the democratic republics of the New
World; and I venture to predict that they will perish from this circumstance unless the government
succeeds in creating an armed force, which, whilst it remains under the control of the majority
of the nation, will be independent of the town population, and able to repress its excesses.

[The population of the city of New York had risen, in 1870, to 942,292, and that of Philadelphia
to 674,022. Brooklyn, which may be said to form part of New York city, has a population of
396,099, in addition to that of New York. The frequent disturbances in the great cities of
America, and the excessive corruption of their local governments--over which there is no effectual
control--are amongst the greatest evils and dangers of the country.]]

To subject the provinces to the metropolis is therefore not only to place the destiny of the
empire in the hands of a portion of the community, which may be reprobated as unjust, but to
place it in the hands of a populace acting under its own impulses, which must be avoided as
dangerous. The preponderance of capital cities is therefore a serious blow upon the representative
system, and it exposes modern republics to the same defect as the republics of antiquity, which
all perished from not having been acquainted with that form of government.

It would be easy for me to adduce a great number of secondary causes which have contributed
to establish, and which concur to maintain, the democratic republic of the United States. But
I discern two principal circumstances amongst these favorable elements, which I hasten to point
out. I have already observed that the origin of the American settlements may be looked upon
as the first and most efficacious cause to which the present prosperity of the United States
may be attributed. The Americans had the chances of birth in their favor, and their forefathers
imported that equality of conditions into the country whence the democratic republic has very
naturally taken its rise. Nor was this all they did; for besides this republican condition
of society, the early settler bequeathed to their descendants those customs, manners, and opinions
which contribute most to the success of a republican form of government. When I reflect upon
the consequences of this primary circumstance, methinks I see the destiny of America embodied
in the first Puritan who landed on those shores, just as the human race was represented by
the first man.

The chief circumstance which has favored the establishment and the maintenance of a democratic
republic in the United States is the nature of the territory which the American inhabit. Their
ancestors gave them the love of equality and of freedom, but God himself gave them the means
of remaining equal and free, by placing them upon a boundless continent, which is open to their
exertions. General prosperity is favorable to the stability of all governments, but more particularly
of a democratic constitution, which depends upon the dispositions of the majority, and more
particularly of that portion of the community which is most exposed to feel the pressure of
want. When the people rules, it must be rendered happy, or it will overturn the State, and
misery is apt to stimulate it to those excesses to which ambition rouses kings. The physical
causes, independent of the laws, which contribute to promote general prosperity, are more numerous
in America than they have ever been in any other country in the world, at any other period
of history. In the United States not only is legislation democratic, but nature herself favors
the cause of the people.

In what part of human tradition can be found anything at all similar to that which is occurring
under our eyes in North America? The celebrated communities of antiquity were all founded in
the midst of hostile nations, which they were obliged to subjugate before they could flourish
in their place. Even the moderns have found, in some parts of South America, vast regions inhabited
by a people of inferior civilization, but which occupied and cultivated the soil. To found
their new states it was necessary to extirpate or to subdue a numerous population, until civilization
has been made to blush for their success. But North America was only inhabited by wandering
tribes, who took no thought of the natural riches of the soil, and that vast country was still,
properly speaking, an empty continent, a desert land awaiting its inhabitants.

Everything is extraordinary in America, the social condition of the inhabitants, as well as
the laws; but the soil upon which these institutions are founded is more extraordinary than
all the rest. When man was first placed upon the earth by the Creator, the earth was inexhaustible
in its youth, but man was weak and ignorant; and when he had learned to explore the treasures
which it contained, hosts of his fellow creatures covered its surface, and he was obliged to
earn an asylum for repose and for freedom by the sword. At that same period North America was
discovered, as if it had been kept in reserve by the Deity, and had just risen from beneath
the waters of the deluge.

That continent still presents, as it did in the primeval time, rivers which rise from never-failing
sources, green and moist solitudes, and fields which the ploughshare of the husbandman has
never turned. In this state it is offered to man, not in the barbarous and isolated condition
of the early ages, but to a being who is already in possession of the most potent secrets of
the natural world, who is united to his fellow-men, and instructed by the experience of fifty
centuries. At this very time thirteen millions of civilized Europeans are peaceably spreading
over those fertile plains, with whose resources and whose extent they are not yet themselves
accurately acquainted. Three or four thousand soldiers drive the wandering races of the aborigines
before them; these are followed by the pioneers, who pierce the woods, scare off the beasts
of prey, explore the courses of the inland streams, and make ready the triumphal procession
of civilization across the waste.

The favorable influence of the temporal prosperity of America upon the institutions of that
country has been so often described by others, and adverted to by myself, that I shall not
enlarge upon it beyond the addition of a few facts. An erroneous notion is generally entertained
that the deserts of America are peopled by European emigrants, who annually disembark upon
the coasts of the New World, whilst the American population increases and multiplies upon the
soil which its forefathers tilled. The European settler, however, usually arrives in the United
States without friends, and sometimes without resources; in order to subsist he is obliged
to work for hire, and he rarely proceeds beyond that belt of industrious population which adjoins
the ocean. The desert cannot be explored without capital or credit; and the body must be accustomed
to the rigors of a new climate before it can be exposed to the chances of forest life. It is
the Americans themselves who daily quit the spots which gave them birth to acquire extensive
domains in a remote country. Thus the European leaves his cottage for the trans-Atlantic shores;
and the American, who is born on that very coast, plunges in his turn into the wilds of Central
America. This double emigration is incessant; it begins in the remotest parts of Europe, it
crosses the Atlantic Ocean, and it advances over the solitudes of the New World. Millions of
men are marching at once towards the same horizon; their language, their religion, their manners
differ, their object is the same. The gifts of fortune are promised in the West, and to the
West they bend their course. *b

[Footnote b: [The number of foreign immigrants into the United States in the last fifty years
(from 1820 to 1871) is stated to be 7,556,007. Of these, 4,104,553 spoke English--that is,
they came from Great Britain, Ireland, or the British colonies; 2,643,069 came from Germany
or northern Europe; and about half a million from the south of Europe.]]

No event can be compared with this continuous removal of the human race, except perhaps those
irruptions which preceded the fall of the Roman Empire. Then, as well as now, generations of
men were impelled forwards in the same direction to meet and struggle on the same spot; but
the designs of Providence were not the same; then, every newcomer was the harbinger of destruction
and of death; now, every adventurer brings with him the elements of prosperity and of life.
The future still conceals from us the ulterior consequences of this emigration of the Americans
towards the West; but we can readily apprehend its more immediate results. As a portion of
the inhabitants annually leave the States in which they were born, the population of these
States increases very slowly, although they have long been established: thus in Connecticut,
which only contains fifty-nine inhabitants to the square mile, the population has not increased
by more than one-quarter in forty years, whilst that of England has been augmented by one-third
in the lapse of the same period. The European emigrant always lands, therefore, in a country
which is but half full, and where hands are in request: he becomes a workman in easy circumstances;
his son goes to seek his fortune in unpeopled regions, and he becomes a rich landowner. The
former amasses the capital which the latter invests, and the stranger as well as the native
is unacquainted with want.

[Footnote c: In New England the estates are exceedingly small, but they are rarely subjected
to further division.]

A single fact will suffice to show the prodigious number of individuals who leave New England,
in this manner, to settle themselves in the wilds. We were assured in 1830 that thirty-six
of the members of Congress were born in the little State of Connecticut. The population of
Connecticut, which constitutes only one forty-third part of that of the United States, thus
furnished one-eighth of the whole body of representatives. The States of Connecticut, however,
only sends five delegates to Congress; and the thirty-one others sit for the new Western States.
If these thirty-one individuals had remained in Connecticut, it is probable that instead of
becoming rich landowners they would have remained humble laborers, that they would have lived
in obscurity without being able to rise into public life, and that, far from becoming useful
members of the legislature, they might have been unruly citizens.

These reflections do not escape the observation of the Americans any more than of ourselves.

It is difficult to describe the rapacity with which the American rushes forward to secure the
immense booty which fortune proffers to him. In the pursuit he fearlessly braves the arrow
of the Indian and the distempers of the forest; he is unimpressed by the silence of the woods;
the approach of beasts of prey does not disturb him; for he is goaded onwards by a passion
more intense than the love of life. Before him lies a boundless continent, and he urges onwards
as if time pressed, and he was afraid of finding no room for his exertions. I have spoken of
the emigration from the older States, but how shall I describe that which takes place from
the more recent ones? Fifty years have scarcely elapsed since that of Ohio was founded; the
greater part of its inhabitants were not born within its confines; its capital has only been
built thirty years, and its territory is still covered by an immense extent of uncultivated
fields; nevertheless the population of Ohio is already proceeding westward, and most of the
settlers who descend to the fertile savannahs of Illinois are citizens of Ohio. These men left
their first country to improve their condition; they quit their resting-place to ameliorate
it still more; fortune awaits them everywhere, but happiness they cannot attain. The desire
of prosperity is become an ardent and restless passion in their minds which grows by what it
gains. They early broke the ties which bound them to their natal earth, and they have contracted
no fresh ones on their way. Emigration was at first necessary to them as a means of subsistence;
and it soon becomes a sort of game of chance, which they pursue for the emotions it excites
as much as for the gain it procures.

Sometimes the progress of man is so rapid that the desert reappears behind him. The woods stoop
to give him a passage, and spring up again when he has passed. It is not uncommon in crossing
the new States of the West to meet with deserted dwellings in the midst of the wilds; the traveller
frequently discovers the vestiges of a log house in the most solitary retreats, which bear
witness to the power, and no less to the inconstancy of man. In these abandoned fields, and
over these ruins of a day, the primeval forest soon scatters a fresh vegetation, the beasts
resume the haunts which were once their own, and Nature covers the traces of man's path with
branches and with flowers, which obliterate his evanescent track.

I remember that, in crossing one of the woodland districts which still cover the State of New
York, I reached the shores of a lake embosomed in forests coeval with the world. A small island,
covered with woods whose thick foliage concealed its banks, rose from the centre of the waters.
Upon the shores of the lake no object attested the presence of man except a column of smoke
which might be seen on the horizon rising from the tops of the trees to the clouds, and seeming
to hang from heaven rather than to be mounting to the sky. An Indian shallop was hauled up
on the sand, which tempted me to visit the islet that had first attracted my attention, and
in a few minutes I set foot upon its banks. The whole island formed one of those delicious
solitudes of the New World which almost lead civilized man to regret the haunts of the savage.
A luxuriant vegetation bore witness to the incomparable fruitfulness of the soil. The deep
silence which is common to the wilds of North America was only broken by the hoarse cooing
of the wood-pigeon, and the tapping of the woodpecker upon the bark of trees. I was far from
supposing that this spot had ever been inhabited, so completely did Nature seem to be left
to her own caprices; but when I reached the centre of the isle I thought that I discovered
some traces of man. I then proceeded to examine the surrounding objects with care, and I soon
perceived that a European had undoubtedly been led to seek a refuge in this retreat. Yet what
changes had taken place in the scene of his labors! The logs which he had hastily hewn to build
himself a shed had sprouted afresh; the very props were intertwined with living verdure, and
his cabin was transformed into a bower. In the midst of these shrubs a few stones were to be
seen, blackened with fire and sprinkled with thin ashes; here the hearth had no doubt been,
and the chimney in falling had covered it with rubbish. I stood for some time in silent admiration
of the exuberance of Nature and the littleness of man: and when I was obliged to leave that
enchanting solitude, I exclaimed with melancholy, "Are ruins, then, already here?"

In Europe we are wont to look upon a restless disposition, an unbounded desire of riches, and
an excessive love of independence, as propensities very formidable to society. Yet these are
the very elements which ensure a long and peaceful duration to the republics of America. Without
these unquiet passions the population would collect in certain spots, and would soon be subject
to wants like those of the Old World, which it is difficult to satisfy; for such is the present
good fortune of the New World, that the vices of its inhabitants are scarcely less favorable
to society than their virtues. These circumstances exercise a great influence on the estimation
in which human actions are held in the two hemispheres. The Americans frequently term what
we should call cupidity a laudable industry; and they blame as faint-heartedness what we consider
to be the virtue of moderate desires.

In France, simple tastes, orderly manners, domestic affections, and the attachments which men
feel to the place of their birth, are looked upon as great guarantees of the tranquillity and
happiness of the State. But in America nothing seems to be more prejudicial to society than
these virtues. The French Canadians, who have faithfully preserved the traditions of their
pristine manners, are already embarrassed for room upon their small territory; and this little
community, which has so recently begun to exist, will shortly be a prey to the calamities incident
to old nations. In Canada, the most enlightened, patriotic, and humane inhabitants make extraordinary
efforts to render the people dissatisfied with those simple enjoyments which still content
it. There, the seductions of wealth are vaunted with as much zeal as the charms of an honest
but limited income in the Old World, and more exertions are made to excite the passions of
the citizens there than to calm them elsewhere. If we listen to their eulogies, we shall hear
that nothing is more praiseworthy than to exchange the pure and homely pleasures which even
the poor man tastes in his own country for the dull delights of prosperity under a foreign
sky; to leave the patrimonial hearth and the turf beneath which his forefathers sleep; in short,
to abandon the living and the dead in quest of fortune.

At the present time America presents a field for human effort far more extensive than any sum
of labor which can be applied to work it. In America too much knowledge cannot be diffused;
for all knowledge, whilst it may serve him who possesses it, turns also to the advantage of
those who are without it. New wants are not to be feared, since they can be satisfied without
difficulty; the growth of human passions need not be dreaded, since all passions may find an
easy and a legitimate object; nor can men be put in possession of too much freedom, since they
are scarcely ever tempted to misuse their liberties.

The American republics of the present day are like companies of adventurers formed to explore
in common the waste lands of the New World, and busied in a flourishing trade. The passions
which agitate the Americans most deeply are not their political but their commercial passions;
or, to speak more correctly, they introduce the habits they contract in business into their
political life. They love order, without which affairs do not prosper; and they set an especial
value upon a regular conduct, which is the foundation of a solid business; they prefer the
good sense which amasses large fortunes to that enterprising spirit which frequently dissipates
them; general ideas alarm their minds, which are accustomed to positive calculations, and they
hold practice in more honor than theory.

It is in America that one learns to understand the influence which physical prosperity exercises
over political actions, and even over opinions which ought to acknowledge no sway but that
of reason; and it is more especially amongst strangers that this truth is perceptible. Most
of the European emigrants to the New World carry with them that wild love of independence and
of change which our calamities are so apt to engender. I sometimes met with Europeans in the
United States who had been obliged to leave their own country on account of their political
opinions. They all astonished me by the language they held, but one of them surprised me more
than all the rest. As I was crossing one of the most remote districts of Pennsylvania I was
benighted, and obliged to beg for hospitality at the gate of a wealthy planter, who was a Frenchman
by birth. He bade me sit down beside his fire, and we began to talk with that freedom which
befits persons who meet in the backwoods, two thousand leagues from their native country. I
was aware that my host had been a great leveller and an ardent demagogue forty years ago, and
that his name was not unknown to fame. I was, therefore, not a little surprised to hear him
discuss the rights of property as an economist or a landowner might have done: he spoke of
the necessary gradations which fortune establishes among men, of obedience to established laws,
of the influence of good morals in commonwealths, and of the support which religious opinions
give to order and to freedom; he even went to far as to quote an evangelical authority in corroboration
of one of his political tenets.

I listened, and marvelled at the feebleness of human reason. A proposition is true or false,
but no art can prove it to be one or the other, in the midst of the uncertainties of science
and the conflicting lessons of experience, until a new incident disperses the clouds of doubt;
I was poor, I become rich, and I am not to expect that prosperity will act upon my conduct,
and leave my judgment free; my opinions change with my fortune, and the happy circumstances
which I turn to my advantage furnish me with that decisive argument which was before wanting.
The influence of prosperity acts still more freely upon the American than upon strangers. The
American has always seen the connection of public order and public prosperity, intimately united
as they are, go on before his eyes; he does not conceive that one can subsist without the other;
he has therefore nothing to forget; nor has he, like so many Europeans, to unlearn the lessons
of his early education.

Chapter XVII: Principal Causes Maintaining The Democratic Republic--Part II

Influence Of The Laws Upon The Maintenance Of The Democratic Republic In The United States

Three principal causes of the maintenance of the democratic republic--Federal Constitutions--Municipal
institutions--Judicial power.

The principal aim of this book has been to make known the laws of the United States; if this
purpose has been accomplished, the reader is already enabled to judge for himself which are
the laws that really tend to maintain the democratic republic, and which endanger its existence.
If I have not succeeded in explaining this in the whole course of my work, I cannot hope to
do so within the limits of a single chapter. It is not my intention to retrace the path I have
already pursued, and a very few lines will suffice to recapitulate what I have previously explained.

Three circumstances seem to me to contribute most powerfully to the maintenance of the democratic
republic in the United States.

The first is that Federal form of Government which the Americans have adopted, and which enables
the Union to combine the power of a great empire with the security of a small State.

The second consists in those municipal institutions which limit the despotism of the majority,
and at the same time impart a taste for freedom and a knowledge of the art of being free to
the people.

The third is to be met with in the constitution of the judicial power. I have shown in what
manner the courts of justice serve to repress the excesses of democracy, and how they check
and direct the impulses of the majority without stopping its activity.

Influence Of Manners Upon The Maintenance Of The Democratic Republic In The United States

I have previously remarked that the manners of the people may be considered as one of the general
causes to which the maintenance of a democratic republic in the United States is attributable.
I here used the word manners with the meaning which the ancients attached to the word mores,
for I apply it not only to manners in their proper sense of what constitutes the character
of social intercourse, but I extend it to the various notions and opinions current among men,
and to the mass of those ideas which constitute their character of mind. I comprise, therefore,
under this term the whole moral and intellectual condition of a people. My intention is not
to draw a picture of American manners, but simply to point out such features of them as are
favorable to the maintenance of political institutions.

Religion Considered As A Political Institution, Which Powerfully Contributes To The Maintenance
Of The Democratic Republic Amongst The Americans

North America peopled by men who professed a democratic and republican Christianity--Arrival
of the Catholics--For what reason the Catholics form the most democratic and the most republican
class at the present time.

Every religion is to be found in juxtaposition to a political opinion which is connected with
it by affinity. If the human mind be left to follow its own bent, it will regulate the temporal
and spiritual institutions of society upon one uniform principle; and man will endeavor, if
I may use the expression, to harmonize the state in which he lives upon earth with the state
which he believes to await him in heaven. The greatest part of British America was peopled
by men who, after having shaken off the authority of the Pope, acknowledged no other religious
supremacy; they brought with them into the New World a form of Christianity which I cannot
better describe than by styling it a democratic and republican religion. This sect contributed
powerfully to the establishment of a democracy and a republic, and from the earliest settlement
of the emigrants politics and religion contracted an alliance which has never been dissolved.

About fifty years ago Ireland began to pour a Catholic population into the United States; on
the other hand, the Catholics of America made proselytes, and at the present moment more than
a million of Christians professing the truths of the Church of Rome are to be met with in the
Union. *d The Catholics are faithful to the observances of their religion; they are fervent
and zealous in the support and belief of their doctrines. Nevertheless they constitute the
most republican and the most democratic class of citizens which exists in the United States;
and although this fact may surprise the observer at first, the causes by which it is occasioned
may easily be discovered upon reflection.

[Footnote d: [It is difficult to ascertain with accuracy the amount of the Roman Catholic population
of the United States, but in 1868 an able writer in the "Edinburgh Review" (vol. cxxvii. p.
521) affirmed that the whole Catholic population of the United States was then about 4,000,000,
divided into 43 dioceses, with 3,795 churches, under the care of 45 bishops and 2,317 clergymen.
But this rapid increase is mainly supported by immigration from the Catholic countries of Europe.]]

I think that the Catholic religion has erroneously been looked upon as the natural enemy of
democracy. Amongst the various sects of Christians, Catholicism seems to me, on the contrary,
to be one of those which are most favorable to the equality of conditions. In the Catholic
Church, the religious community is composed of only two elements, the priest and the people.
The priest alone rises above the rank of his flock, and all below him are equal.

On doctrinal points the Catholic faith places all human capacities upon the same level; it
subjects the wise and ignorant, the man of genius and the vulgar crowd, to the details of the
same creed; it imposes the same observances upon the rich and needy, it inflicts the same austerities
upon the strong and the weak, it listens to no compromise with mortal man, but, reducing all
the human race to the same standard, it confounds all the distinctions of society at the foot
of the same altar, even as they are confounded in the sight of God. If Catholicism predisposes
the faithful to obedience, it certainly does not prepare them for inequality; but the contrary
may be said of Protestantism, which generally tends to make men independent, more than to render
them equal.

Catholicism is like an absolute monarchy; if the sovereign be removed, all the other classes
of society are more equal than they are in republics. It has not unfrequently occurred that
the Catholic priest has left the service of the altar to mix with the governing powers of society,
and to take his place amongst the civil gradations of men. This religious influence has sometimes
been used to secure the interests of that political state of things to which he belonged. At
other times Catholics have taken the side of aristocracy from a spirit of religion.

But no sooner is the priesthood entirely separated from the government, as is the case in the
United States, than is found that no class of men are more naturally disposed than the Catholics
to transfuse the doctrine of the equality of conditions into the political world. If, then,
the Catholic citizens of the United States are not forcibly led by the nature of their tenets
to adopt democratic and republican principles, at least they are not necessarily opposed to
them; and their social position, as well as their limited number, obliges them to adopt these
opinions. Most of the Catholics are poor, and they have no chance of taking a part in the government
unless it be open to all the citizens. They constitute a minority, and all rights must be respected
in order to insure to them the free exercise of their own privileges. These two causes induce
them, unconsciously, to adopt political doctrines, which they would perhaps support with less
zeal if they were rich and preponderant.

The Catholic clergy of the United States has never attempted to oppose this political tendency,
but it seeks rather to justify its results. The priests in America have divided the intellectual
world into two parts: in the one they place the doctrines of revealed religion, which command
their assent; in the other they leave those truths which they believe to have been freely left
open to the researches of political inquiry. Thus the Catholics of the United States are at
the same time the most faithful believers and the most zealous citizens.

It may be asserted that in the United States no religious doctrine displays the slightest hostility
to democratic and republican institutions. The clergy of all the different sects hold the same
language, their opinions are consonant to the laws, and the human intellect flows onwards in
one sole current.

I happened to be staying in one of the largest towns in the Union, when I was invited to attend
a public meeting which had been called for the purpose of assisting the Poles, and of sending
them supplies of arms and money. I found two or three thousand persons collected in a vast
hall which had been prepared to receive them. In a short time a priest in his ecclesiastical
robes advanced to the front of the hustings: the spectators rose, and stood uncovered, whilst
he spoke in the following terms:--

"Almighty God! the God of Armies! Thou who didst strengthen the hearts and guide the arms of
our fathers when they were fighting for the sacred rights of national independence; Thou who
didst make them triumph over a hateful oppression, and hast granted to our people the benefits
of liberty and peace; Turn, O Lord, a favorable eye upon the other hemisphere; pitifully look
down upon that heroic nation which is even now struggling as we did in the former time, and
for the same rights which we defended with our blood. Thou, who didst create Man in the likeness
of the same image, let not tyranny mar Thy work, and establish inequality upon the earth. Almighty
God! do Thou watch over the destiny of the Poles, and render them worthy to be free. May Thy
wisdom direct their councils, and may Thy strength sustain their arms! Shed forth Thy terror
over their enemies, scatter the powers which take counsel against them; and vouchsafe that
the injustice which the world has witnessed for fifty years, be not consummated in our time.
O Lord, who holdest alike the hearts of nations and of men in Thy powerful hand; raise up allies
to the sacred cause of right; arouse the French nation from the apathy in which its rulers
retain it, that it go forth again to fight for the liberties of the world.

"Lord, turn not Thou Thy face from us, and grant that we may always be the most religious as
well as the freest people of the earth. Almighty God, hear our supplications this day. Save
the Poles, we beseech Thee, in the name of Thy well-beloved Son, our Lord Jesus Christ, who
died upon the cross for the salvation of men. Amen."

The whole meeting responded "Amen!" with devotion.

Indirect Influence Of Religious Opinions Upon Political Society In The United States

Christian morality common to all sects--Influence of religion upon the manners of the Americans--Respect
for the marriage tie--In what manner religion confines the imagination of the Americans within
certain limits, and checks the passion of innovation--Opinion of the Americans on the political
utility of religion--Their exertions to extend and secure its predominance.

I have just shown what the direct influence of religion upon politics is in the United States,
but its indirect influence appears to me to be still more considerable, and it never instructs
the Americans more fully in the art of being free than when it says nothing of freedom.

The sects which exist in the United States are innumerable. They all differ in respect to the
worship which is due from man to his Creator, but they all agree in respect to the duties which
are due from man to man. Each sect adores the Deity in its own peculiar manner, but all the
sects preach the same moral law in the name of God. If it be of the highest importance to man,
as an individual, that his religion should be true, the case of society is not the same. Society
has no future life to hope for or to fear; and provided the citizens profess a religion, the
peculiar tenets of that religion are of very little importance to its interests. Moreover,
almost all the sects of the United States are comprised within the great unity of Christianity,
and Christian morality is everywhere the same.

It may be believed without unfairness that a certain number of Americans pursue a peculiar
form of worship, from habit more than from conviction. In the United States the sovereign authority
is religious, and consequently hypocrisy must be common; but there is no country in the whole
world in which the Christian religion retains a greater influence over the souls of men than
in America; and there can be no greater proof of its utility, and of its conformity to human
nature, than that its influence is most powerfully felt over the most enlightened and free
nation of the earth.

I have remarked that the members of the American clergy in general, without even excepting
those who do not admit religious liberty, are all in favor of civil freedom; but they do not
support any particular political system. They keep aloof from parties and from public affairs.
In the United States religion exercises but little influence upon the laws and upon the details
of public opinion, but it directs the manners of the community, and by regulating domestic
life it regulates the State.

I do not question that the great austerity of manners which is observable in the United States,
arises, in the first instance, from religious faith. Religion is often unable to restrain man
from the numberless temptations of fortune; nor can it check that passion for gain which every
incident of his life contributes to arouse, but its influence over the mind of woman is supreme,
and women are the protectors of morals. There is certainly no country in the world where the
tie of marriage is so much respected as in America, or where conjugal happiness is more highly
or worthily appreciated. In Europe almost all the disturbances of society arise from the irregularities
of domestic life. To despise the natural bonds and legitimate pleasures of home, is to contract
a taste for excesses, a restlessness of heart, and the evil of fluctuating desires. Agitated
by the tumultuous passions which frequently disturb his dwelling, the European is galled by
the obedience which the legislative powers of the State exact. But when the American retires
from the turmoil of public life to the bosom of his family, he finds in it the image of order
and of peace. There his pleasures are simple and natural, his joys are innocent and calm; and
as he finds that an orderly life is the surest path to happiness, he accustoms himself without
difficulty to moderate his opinions as well as his tastes. Whilst the European endeavors to
forget his domestic troubles by agitating society, the American derives from his own home that
love of order which he afterwards carries with him into public affairs.

In the United States the influence of religion is not confined to the manners, but it extends
to the intelligence of the people. Amongst the Anglo-Americans, there are some who profess
the doctrines of Christianity from a sincere belief in them, and others who do the same because
they are afraid to be suspected of unbelief. Christianity, therefore, reigns without any obstacle,
by universal consent; the consequence is, as I have before observed, that every principle of
the moral world is fixed and determinate, although the political world is abandoned to the
debates and the experiments of men. Thus the human mind is never left to wander across a boundless
field; and, whatever may be its pretensions, it is checked from time to time by barriers which
it cannot surmount. Before it can perpetrate innovation, certain primal and immutable principles
are laid down, and the boldest conceptions of human device are subjected to certain forms which
retard and stop their completion.

The imagination of the Americans, even in its greatest flights, is circumspect and undecided;
its impulses are checked, and its works unfinished. These habits of restraint recur in political
society, and are singularly favorable both to the tranquillity of the people and to the durability
of the institutions it has established. Nature and circumstances concurred to make the inhabitants
of the United States bold men, as is sufficiently attested by the enterprising spirit with
which they seek for fortune. If the mind of the Americans were free from all trammels, they
would very shortly become the most daring innovators and the most implacable disputants in
the world. But the revolutionists of America are obliged to profess an ostensible respect for
Christian morality and equity, which does not easily permit them to violate the laws that oppose
their designs; nor would they find it easy to surmount the scruples of their partisans, even
if they were able to get over their own. Hitherto no one in the United States has dared to
advance the maxim, that everything is permissible with a view to the interests of society;
an impious adage which seems to have been invented in an age of freedom to shelter all the
tyrants of future ages. Thus whilst the law permits the Americans to do what they please, religion
prevents them from conceiving, and forbids them to commit, what is rash or unjust.

Religion in America takes no direct part in the government of society, but it must nevertheless
be regarded as the foremost of the political institutions of that country; for if it does not
impart a taste for freedom, it facilitates the use of free institutions. Indeed, it is in this
same point of view that the inhabitants of the United States themselves look upon religious
belief. I do not know whether all the Americans have a sincere faith in their religion, for
who can search the human heart? but I am certain that they hold it to be indispensable to the
maintenance of republican institutions. This opinion is not peculiar to a class of citizens
or to a party, but it belongs to the whole nation, and to every rank of society.

In the United States, if a political character attacks a sect, this may not prevent even the
partisans of that very sect from supporting him; but if he attacks all the sects together,
everyone abandons him, and he remains alone.

Whilst I was in America, a witness, who happened to be called at the assizes of the county
of Chester (State of New York), declared that he did not believe in the existence of God, or
in the immortality of the soul. The judge refused to admit his evidence, on the ground that
the witness had destroyed beforehand all the confidence of the Court in what he was about to
say. *e The newspapers related the fact without any further comment.

[Footnote e: The New York "Spectator" of August 23, 1831, relates the fact in the following
terms:--"The Court of Common Pleas of Chester county (New York) a few days since rejected a
witness who declared his disbelief in the existence of God. The presiding judge remarked that
he had not before been aware that there was a man living who did not believe in the existence
of God; that this belief constituted the sanction of all testimony in a court of justice, and
that he knew of no cause in a Christian country where a witness had been permitted to testify
without such belief."]

The Americans combine the notions of Christianity and of liberty so intimately in their minds,
that it is impossible to make them conceive the one without the other; and with them this conviction
does not spring from that barren traditionary faith which seems to vegetate in the soul rather
than to live.

I have known of societies formed by the Americans to send out ministers of the Gospel into
the new Western States to found schools and churches there, lest religion should be suffered
to die away in those remote settlements, and the rising States be less fitted to enjoy free
institutions than the people from which they emanated. I met with wealthy New Englanders who
abandoned the country in which they were born in order to lay the foundations of Christianity
and of freedom on the banks of the Missouri, or in the prairies of Illinois. Thus religious
zeal is perpetually stimulated in the United States by the duties of patriotism. These men
do not act from an exclusive consideration of the promises of a future life; eternity is only
one motive of their devotion to the cause; and if you converse with these missionaries of Christian
civilization, you will be surprised to find how much value they set upon the goods of this
world, and that you meet with a politician where you expected to find a priest. They will tell
you that "all the American republics are collectively involved with each other; if the republics
of the West were to fall into anarchy, or to be mastered by a despot, the republican institutions
which now flourish upon the shores of the Atlantic Ocean would be in great peril. It is, therefore,
our interest that the new States should be religious, in order to maintain our liberties."

Such are the opinions of the Americans, and if any hold that the religious spirit which I admire
is the very thing most amiss in America, and that the only element wanting to the freedom and
happiness of the human race is to believe in some blind cosmogony, or to assert with Cabanis
the secretion of thought by the brain, I can only reply that those who hold this language have
never been in America, and that they have never seen a religious or a free nation. When they
return from their expedition, we shall hear what they have to say.

There are persons in France who look upon republican institutions as a temporary means of power,
of wealth, and distinction; men who are the condottieri of liberty, and who fight for their
own advantage, whatever be the colors they wear: it is not to these that I address myself.
But there are others who look forward to the republican form of government as a tranquil and
lasting state, towards which modern society is daily impelled by the ideas and manners of the
time, and who sincerely desire to prepare men to be free. When these men attack religious opinions,
they obey the dictates of their passions to the prejudice of their interests. Despotism may
govern without faith, but liberty cannot. Religion is much more necessary in the republic which
they set forth in glowing colors than in the monarchy which they attack; and it is more needed
in democratic republics than in any others. How is it possible that society should escape destruction
if the moral tie be not strengthened in proportion as the political tie is relaxed? and what
can be done with a people which is its own master, if it be not submissive to the Divinity?

Chapter XVII: Principal Causes Maintaining The Democratic Republic--Part III

Principal Causes Which Render Religion Powerful In America Care taken by the Americans to separate
the Church from the State--The laws, public opinion, and even the exertions of the clergy concur
to promote this end--Influence of religion upon the mind in the United States attributable
to this cause--Reason of this--What is the natural state of men with regard to religion at
the present time--What are the peculiar and incidental causes which prevent men, in certain
countries, from arriving at this state.

The philosophers of the eighteenth century explained the gradual decay of religious faith in
a very simple manner. Religious zeal, said they, must necessarily fail, the more generally
liberty is established and knowledge diffused. Unfortunately, facts are by no means in accordance
with their theory. There are certain populations in Europe whose unbelief is only equalled
by their ignorance and their debasement, whilst in America one of the freest and most enlightened
nations in the world fulfils all the outward duties of religious fervor.

Upon my arrival in the United States, the religious aspect of the country was the first thing
that struck my attention; and the longer I stayed there the more did I perceive the great political
consequences resulting from this state of things, to which I was unaccustomed. In France I
had almost always seen the spirit of religion and the spirit of freedom pursuing courses diametrically
opposed to each other; but in America I found that they were intimately united, and that they
reigned in common over the same country. My desire to discover the causes of this phenomenon
increased from day to day. In order to satisfy it I questioned the members of all the different
sects; and I more especially sought the society of the clergy, who are the depositaries of
the different persuasions, and who are more especially interested in their duration. As a member
of the Roman Catholic Church I was more particularly brought into contact with several of its
priests, with whom I became intimately acquainted. To each of these men I expressed my astonishment
and I explained my doubts; I found that they differed upon matters of detail alone; and that
they mainly attributed the peaceful dominion of religion in their country to the separation
of Church and State. I do not hesitate to affirm that during my stay in America I did not meet
with a single individual, of the clergy or of the laity, who was not of the same opinion upon
this point.

This led me to examine more attentively than I had hitherto done, the station which the American
clergy occupy in political society. I learned with surprise that they filled no public appointments;
*f not one of them is to be met with in the administration, and they are not even represented
in the legislative assemblies. In several States *g the law excludes them from political life,
public opinion in all. And when I came to inquire into the prevailing spirit of the clergy
I found that most of its members seemed to retire of their own accord from the exercise of
power, and that they made it the pride of their profession to abstain from politics.

[Footnote f: Unless this term be applied to the functions which many of them fill in the schools.
Almost all education is entrusted to the clergy.]

[Footnote g: See the Constitution of New York, art. 7, Section 4:-- "And whereas the ministers
of the gospel are, by their profession, dedicated to the service of God and the care of souls,
and ought not to be diverted from the great duties of their functions: therefore no minister
of the gospel, or priest of any denomination whatsoever, shall at any time hereafter, under
any pretence or description whatever, be eligible to, or capable of holding, any civil or military
office or place within this State."

See also the constitutions of North Carolina, art. 31; Virginia; South Carolina, art. I, Section
23; Kentucky, art. 2, Section 26; Tennessee, art. 8, Section I; Louisiana, art. 2, Section 22.]

I heard them inveigh against ambition and deceit, under whatever political opinions these vices
might chance to lurk; but I learned from their discourses that men are not guilty in the eye
of God for any opinions concerning political government which they may profess with sincerity,
any more than they are for their mistakes in building a house or in driving a furrow. I perceived
that these ministers of the gospel eschewed all parties with the anxiety attendant upon personal
interest. These facts convinced me that what I had been told was true; and it then became my
object to investigate their causes, and to inquire how it happened that the real authority
of religion was increased by a state of things which diminished its apparent force: these causes
did not long escape my researches.

The short space of threescore years can never content the imagination of man; nor can the imperfect
joys of this world satisfy his heart. Man alone, of all created beings, displays a natural
contempt of existence, and yet a boundless desire to exist; he scorns life, but he dreads annihilation.
These different feelings incessantly urge his soul to the contemplation of a future state,
and religion directs his musings thither. Religion, then, is simply another form of hope; and
it is no less natural to the human heart than hope itself. Men cannot abandon their religious
faith without a kind of aberration of intellect, and a sort of violent distortion of their
true natures; but they are invincibly brought back to more pious sentiments; for unbelief is
an accident, and faith is the only permanent state of mankind. If we only consider religious
institutions in a purely human point of view, they may be said to derive an inexhaustible element
of strength from man himself, since they belong to one of the constituent principles of human
nature.

I am aware that at certain times religion may strengthen this influence, which originates in
itself, by the artificial power of the laws, and by the support of those temporal institutions
which direct society. Religions, intimately united to the governments of the earth, have been
known to exercise a sovereign authority derived from the twofold source of terror and of faith;
but when a religion contracts an alliance of this nature, I do not hesitate to affirm that
it commits the same error as a man who should sacrifice his future to his present welfare;
and in obtaining a power to which it has no claim, it risks that authority which is rightfully
its own. When a religion founds its empire upon the desire of immortality which lives in every
human heart, it may aspire to universal dominion; but when it connects itself with a government,
it must necessarily adopt maxims which are only applicable to certain nations. Thus, in forming
an alliance with a political power, religion augments its authority over a few, and forfeits
the hope of reigning over all.

As long as a religion rests upon those sentiments which are the consolation of all affliction,
it may attract the affections of mankind. But if it be mixed up with the bitter passions of
the world, it may be constrained to defend allies whom its interests, and not the principle
of love, have given to it; or to repel as antagonists men who are still attached to its own
spirit, however opposed they may be to the powers to which it is allied. The Church cannot
share the temporal power of the State without being the object of a portion of that animosity
which the latter excites.

The political powers which seem to be most firmly established have frequently no better guarantee
for their duration than the opinions of a generation, the interests of the time, or the life
of an individual. A law may modify the social condition which seems to be most fixed and determinate;
and with the social condition everything else must change. The powers of society are more or
less fugitive, like the years which we spend upon the earth; they succeed each other with rapidity,
like the fleeting cares of life; and no government has ever yet been founded upon an invariable
disposition of the human heart, or upon an imperishable interest.

As long as a religion is sustained by those feelings, propensities, and passions which are
found to occur under the same forms, at all the different periods of history, it may defy the
efforts of time; or at least it can only be destroyed by another religion. But when religion
clings to the interests of the world, it becomes almost as fragile a thing as the powers of
earth. It is the only one of them all which can hope for immortality; but if it be connected
with their ephemeral authority, it shares their fortunes, and may fall with those transient
passions which supported them for a day. The alliance which religion contracts with political
powers must needs be onerous to itself; since it does not require their assistance to live,
and by giving them its assistance to live, and by giving them its assistance it may be exposed
to decay.

The danger which I have just pointed out always exists, but it is not always equally visible.
In some ages governments seem to be imperishable; in others, the existence of society appears
to be more precarious than the life of man. Some constitutions plunge the citizens into a lethargic
somnolence, and others rouse them to feverish excitement. When governments appear to be so
strong, and laws so stable, men do not perceive the dangers which may accrue from a union of
Church and State. When governments display so much weakness, and laws so much inconstancy,
the danger is self-evident, but it is no longer possible to avoid it; to be effectual, measures
must be taken to discover its approach.

In proportion as a nation assumes a democratic condition of society, and as communities display
democratic propensities, it becomes more and more dangerous to connect religion with political
institutions; for the time is coming when authority will be bandied from hand to hand, when
political theories will succeed each other, and when men, laws, and constitutions will disappear,
or be modified from day to day, and this, not for a season only, but unceasingly. Agitation
and mutability are inherent in the nature of democratic republics, just as stagnation and inertness
are the law of absolute monarchies.

If the Americans, who change the head of the Government once in four years, who elect new legislators
every two years, and renew the provincial officers every twelvemonth; if the Americans, who
have abandoned the political world to the attempts of innovators, had not placed religion beyond
their reach, where could it abide in the ebb and flow of human opinions? where would that respect
which belongs to it be paid, amidst the struggles of faction? and what would become of its
immortality, in the midst of perpetual decay? The American clergy were the first to perceive
this truth, and to act in conformity with it. They saw that they must renounce their religious
influence, if they were to strive for political power; and they chose to give up the support
of the State, rather than to share its vicissitudes.

In America, religion is perhaps less powerful than it has been at certain periods in the history
of certain peoples; but its influence is more lasting. It restricts itself to its own resources,
but of those none can deprive it: its circle is limited to certain principles, but those principles
are entirely its own, and under its undisputed control.

On every side in Europe we hear voices complaining of the absence of religious faith, and inquiring
the means of restoring to religion some remnant of its pristine authority. It seems to me that
we must first attentively consider what ought to be the natural state of men with regard to
religion at the present time; and when we know what we have to hope and to fear, we may discern
the end to which our efforts ought to be directed.

The two great dangers which threaten the existence of religions are schism and indifference.
In ages of fervent devotion, men sometimes abandon their religion, but they only shake it off
in order to adopt another. Their faith changes the objects to which it is directed, but it
suffers no decline. The old religion then excites enthusiastic attachment or bitter enmity
in either party; some leave it with anger, others cling to it with increased devotedness, and
although persuasions differ, irreligion is unknown. Such, however, is not the case when a religious
belief is secretly undermined by doctrines which may be termed negative, since they deny the
truth of one religion without affirming that of any other. Progidious revolutions then take
place in the human mind, without the apparent co-operation of the passions of man, and almost
without his knowledge. Men lose the objects of their fondest hopes, as if through forgetfulness.
They are carried away by an imperceptible current which they have not the courage to stem,
but which they follow with regret, since it bears them from a faith they love, to a scepticism
that plunges them into despair.

In ages which answer to this description, men desert their religious opinions from lukewarmness
rather than from dislike; they do not reject them, but the sentiments by which they were once
fostered disappear. But if the unbeliever does not admit religion to be true, he still considers
it useful. Regarding religious institutions in a human point of view, he acknowledges their
influence upon manners and legislation. He admits that they may serve to make men live in peace
with one another, and to prepare them gently for the hour of death. He regrets the faith which
he has lost; and as he is deprived of a treasure which he has learned to estimate at its full
value, he scruples to take it from those who still possess it.

On the other hand, those who continue to believe are not afraid openly to avow their faith.
They look upon those who do not share their persuasion as more worthy of pity than of opposition;
and they are aware that to acquire the esteem of the unbelieving, they are not obliged to follow
their example. They are hostile to no one in the world; and as they do not consider the society
in which they live as an arena in which religion is bound to face its thousand deadly foes,
they love their contemporaries, whilst they condemn their weaknesses and lament their errors.

As those who do not believe, conceal their incredulity; and as those who believe, display their
faith, public opinion pronounces itself in favor of religion: love, support, and honor are
bestowed upon it, and it is only by searching the human soul that we can detect the wounds
which it has received. The mass of mankind, who are never without the feeling of religion,
do not perceive anything at variance with the established faith. The instinctive desire of
a future life brings the crowd about the altar, and opens the hearts of men to the precepts
and consolations of religion.

But this picture is not applicable to us: for there are men amongst us who have ceased to believe
in Christianity, without adopting any other religion; others who are in the perplexities of
doubt, and who already affect not to believe; and others, again, who are afraid to avow that
Christian faith which they still cherish in secret.

Amidst these lukewarm partisans and ardent antagonists a small number of believers exist, who
are ready to brave all obstacles and to scorn all dangers in defence of their faith. They have
done violence to human weakness, in order to rise superior to public opinion. Excited by the
effort they have made, they scarcely knew where to stop; and as they know that the first use
which the French made of independence was to attack religion, they look upon their contemporaries
with dread, and they recoil in alarm from the liberty which their fellow-citizens are seeking
to obtain. As unbelief appears to them to be a novelty, they comprise all that is new in one
indiscriminate animosity. They are at war with their age and country, and they look upon every
opinion which is put forth there as the necessary enemy of the faith.

Such is not the natural state of men with regard to religion at the present day; and some extraordinary
or incidental cause must be at work in France to prevent the human mind from following its
original propensities and to drive it beyond the limits at which it ought naturally to stop.
I am intimately convinced that this extraordinary and incidental cause is the close connection
of politics and religion. The unbelievers of Europe attack the Christians as their political
opponents, rather than as their religious adversaries; they hate the Christian religion as
the opinion of a party, much more than as an error of belief; and they reject the clergy less
because they are the representatives of the Divinity than because they are the allies of authority.

In Europe, Christianity has been intimately united to the powers of the earth. Those powers
are now in decay, and it is, as it were, buried under their ruins. The living body of religion
has been bound down to the dead corpse of superannuated polity: cut but the bonds which restrain
it, and that which is alive will rise once more. I know not what could restore the Christian
Church of Europe to the energy of its earlier days; that power belongs to God alone; but it
may be the effect of human policy to leave the faith in the full exercise of the strength which
it still retains.

How The Instruction, The Habits, And The Practical Experience Of The Americans Promote The
Success Of Their Democratic Institutions

What is to be understood by the instruction of the American people--The human mind more superficially
instructed in the United States than in Europe--No one completely uninstructed--Reason of this--Rapidity
with which opinions are diffused even in the uncultivated States of the West--Practical experience
more serviceable to the Americans than book-learning.

I have but little to add to what I have already said concerning the influence which the instruction
and the habits of the Americans exercise upon the maintenance of their political institutions.

America has hitherto produced very few writers of distinction; it possesses no great historians,
and not a single eminent poet. The inhabitants of that country look upon what are properly
styled literary pursuits with a kind of disapprobation; and there are towns of very second-rate
importance in Europe in which more literary works are annually published than in the twenty-four
States of the Union put together. The spirit of the Americans is averse to general ideas; and
it does not seek theoretical discoveries. Neither politics nor manufactures direct them to
these occupations; and although new laws are perpetually enacted in the United States, no great
writers have hitherto inquired into the general principles of their legislation. The Americans
have lawyers and commentators, but no jurists; *h and they furnish examples rather than lessons
to the world. The same observation applies to the mechanical arts. In America, the inventions
of Europe are adopted with sagacity; they are perfected, and adapted with admirable skill to
the wants of the country. Manufactures exist, but the science of manufacture is not cultivated;
and they have good workmen, but very few inventors. Fulton was obliged to proffer his services
to foreign nations for a long time before he was able to devote them to his own country.

[Footnote h: [This cannot be said with truth of the country of Kent, Story, and Wheaton.]]

The observer who is desirous of forming an opinion on the state of instruction amongst the
Anglo-Americans must consider the same object from two different points of view. If he only
singles out the learned, he will be astonished to find how rare they are; but if he counts
the ignorant, the American people will appear to be the most enlightened community in the world.
The whole population, as I observed in another place, is situated between these two extremes.
In New England, every citizen receives the elementary notions of human knowledge; he is moreover
taught the doctrines and the evidences of his religion, the history of his country, and the
leading features of its Constitution. In the States of Connecticut and Massachusetts, it is
extremely rare to find a man imperfectly acquainted with all these things, and a person wholly
ignorant of them is a sort of phenomenon.

When I compare the Greek and Roman republics with these American States; the manuscript libraries
of the former, and their rude population, with the innumerable journals and the enlightened
people of the latter; when I remember all the attempts which are made to judge the modern republics
by the assistance of those of antiquity, and to infer what will happen in our time from what
took place two thousand years ago, I am tempted to burn my books, in order to apply none but
novel ideas to so novel a condition of society.

What I have said of New England must not, however, be applied indistinctly to the whole Union;
as we advance towards the West or the South, the instruction of the people diminishes. In the
States which are adjacent to the Gulf of Mexico, a certain number of individuals may be found,
as in our own countries, who are devoid of the rudiments of instruction. But there is not a
single district in the United States sunk in complete ignorance; and for a very simple reason:
the peoples of Europe started from the darkness of a barbarous condition, to advance toward
the light of civilization; their progress has been unequal; some of them have improved apace,
whilst others have loitered in their course, and some have stopped, and are still sleeping
upon the way. *i

[Footnote i: [In the Northern States the number of persons destitute of instruction is inconsiderable,
the largest number being 241,152 in the State of New York (according to Spaulding's "Handbook
of American Statistics" for 1874); but in the South no less than 1,516,339 whites and 2,671,396
colored persons are returned as "illiterate."]]

Such has not been the case in the United States. The Anglo-Americans settled in a state of
civilization, upon that territory which their descendants occupy; they had not to begin to
learn, and it was sufficient for them not to forget. Now the children of these same Americans
are the persons who, year by year, transport their dwellings into the wilds; and with their
dwellings their acquired information and their esteem for knowledge. Education has taught them
the utility of instruction, and has enabled them to transmit that instruction to their posterity.
In the United States society has no infancy, but it is born in man's estate.

The Americans never use the word "peasant," because they have no idea of the peculiar class
which that term denotes; the ignorance of more remote ages, the simplicity of rural life, and
the rusticity of the villager have not been preserved amongst them; and they are alike unacquainted
with the virtues, the vices, the coarse habits, and the simple graces of an early stage of
civilization. At the extreme borders of the Confederate States, upon the confines of society
and of the wilderness, a population of bold adventurers have taken up their abode, who pierce
the solitudes of the American woods, and seek a country there, in order to escape that poverty
which awaited them in their native provinces. As soon as the pioneer arrives upon the spot
which is to serve him for a retreat, he fells a few trees and builds a loghouse. Nothing can
offer a more miserable aspect than these isolated dwellings. The traveller who approaches one
of them towards nightfall, sees the flicker of the hearth-flame through the chinks in the walls;
and at night, if the wind rises, he hears the roof of boughs shake to and fro in the midst
of the great forest trees. Who would not suppose that this poor hut is the asylum of rudeness
and ignorance? Yet no sort of comparison can be drawn between the pioneer and the dwelling
which shelters him. Everything about him is primitive and unformed, but he is himself the result
of the labor and the experience of eighteen centuries. He wears the dress, and he speaks the
language of cities; he is acquainted with the past, curious of the future, and ready for argument
upon the present; he is, in short, a highly civilized being, who consents, for a time, to inhabit
the backwoods, and who penetrates into the wilds of the New World with the Bible, an axe, and
a file of newspapers.

It is difficult to imagine the incredible rapidity with which public opinion circulates in
the midst of these deserts. *j I do not think that so much intellectual intercourse takes place
in the most enlightened and populous districts of France. *k It cannot be doubted that, in
the United States, the instruction of the people powerfully contributes to the support of a
democratic republic; and such must always be the case, I believe, where instruction which awakens
the understanding is not separated from moral education which amends the heart. But I by no
means exaggerate this benefit, and I am still further from thinking, as so many people do think
in Europe, that men can be instantaneously made citizens by teaching them to read and write.
True information is mainly derived from experience; and if the Americans had not been gradually
accustomed to govern themselves, their book-learning would not assist them much at the present day.

[Footnote j: I travelled along a portion of the frontier of the United States in a sort of
cart which was termed the mail. We passed, day and night, with great rapidity along the roads
which were scarcely marked out, through immense forests; when the gloom of the woods became
impenetrable the coachman lighted branches of fir, and we journeyed along by the light they
cast. From time to time we came to a hut in the midst of the forest, which was a post-office.
The mail dropped an enormous bundle of letters at the door of this isolated dwelling, and we
pursued our way at full gallop, leaving the inhabitants of the neighboring log houses to send
for their share of the treasure.

[When the author visited America the locomotive and the railroad were scarcely invented, and
not yet introduced in the United States. It is superfluous to point out the immense effect
of those inventions in extending civilization and developing the resources of that vast continent.
In 1831 there were 51 miles of railway in the United States; in 1872 there were 60,000 miles
of railway.]]

[Footnote k: In 1832 each inhabitant of Michigan paid a sum equivalent to 1 fr. 22 cent. (French
money) to the post-office revenue, and each inhabitant of the Floridas paid 1 fr. 5 cent. (See
"National Calendar," 1833, p. 244.) In the same year each inhabitant of the Departement du
Nord paid 1 fr. 4 cent. to the revenue of the French post-office. (See the "Compte rendu de
l'administration des Finances," 1833, p. 623.) Now the State of Michigan only contained at
that time 7 inhabitants per square league and Florida only 5: the public instruction and the
commercial activity of these districts is inferior to that of most of the States in the Union,
whilst the Departement du Nord, which contains 3,400 inhabitants per square league, is one
of the most enlightened and manufacturing parts of France.]

I have lived a great deal with the people in the United States, and I cannot express how much
I admire their experience and their good sense. An American should never be allowed to speak
of Europe; for he will then probably display a vast deal of presumption and very foolish pride.
He will take up with those crude and vague notions which are so useful to the ignorant all
over the world. But if you question him respecting his own country, the cloud which dimmed
his intelligence will immediately disperse; his language will become as clear and as precise
as his thoughts. He will inform you what his rights are, and by what means he exercises them;
he will be able to point out the customs which obtain in the political world. You will find
that he is well acquainted with the rules of the administration, and that he is familiar with
the mechanism of the laws. The citizen of the United States does not acquire his practical
science and his positive notions from books; the instruction he has acquired may have prepared
him for receiving those ideas, but it did not furnish them. The American learns to know the
laws by participating in the act of legislation; and he takes a lesson in the forms of government
from governing. The great work of society is ever going on beneath his eyes, and, as it were,
under his hands.

In the United States politics are the end and aim of education; in Europe its principal object
is to fit men for private life. The interference of the citizens in public affairs is too rare
an occurrence for it to be anticipated beforehand. Upon casting a glance over society in the
two hemispheres, these differences are indicated even by its external aspect.

In Europe we frequently introduce the ideas and the habits of private life into public affairs;
and as we pass at once from the domestic circle to the government of the State, we may frequently
be heard to discuss the great interests of society in the same manner in which we converse
with our friends. The Americans, on the other hand, transfuse the habits of public life into
their manners in private; and in their country the jury is introduced into the games of schoolboys,
and parliamentary forms are observed in the order of a feast.

Chapter XVII: Principal Causes Maintaining The Democratic Republic--Part IV

The Laws Contribute More To The Maintenance Of The Democratic Republic In The United States
Than The Physical Circumstances Of The Country, And The Manners More Than The Laws

All the nations of America have a democratic state of society--Yet democratic institutions
only subsist amongst the Anglo-Americans--The Spaniards of South America, equally favored by
physical causes as the Anglo-Americans, unable to maintain a democratic republic--Mexico, which
has adopted the Constitution of the United States, in the same predicament--The Anglo-Americans
of the West less able to maintain it than those of the East--Reason of these different results.

I have remarked that the maintenance of democratic institutions in the United States is attributable
to the circumstances, the laws, and the manners of that country. *l Most Europeans are only
acquainted with the first of these three causes, and they are apt to give it a preponderating
importance which it does not really possess.

[Footnote l: I remind the reader of the general signification which I give to the word "manners,"
namely, the moral and intellectual characteristics of social man taken collectively.]

It is true that the Anglo-Saxons settled in the New World in a state of social equality; the
low-born and the noble were not to be found amongst them; and professional prejudices were
always as entirely unknown as the prejudices of birth. Thus, as the condition of society was
democratic, the empire of democracy was established without difficulty. But this circumstance
is by no means peculiar to the United States; almost all the trans-Atlantic colonies were founded
by men equal amongst themselves, or who became so by inhabiting them. In no one part of the
New World have Europeans been able to create an aristocracy. Nevertheless, democratic institutions
prosper nowhere but in the United States.

The American Union has no enemies to contend with; it stands in the wilds like an island in
the ocean. But the Spaniards of South America were no less isolated by nature; yet their position
has not relieved them from the charge of standing armies. They make war upon each other when
they have no foreign enemies to oppose; and the Anglo-American democracy is the only one which
has hitherto been able to maintain itself in peace. *m

[Footnote m: [A remark which, since the great Civil War of 1861-65, ceases to be applicable.]]

The territory of the Union presents a boundless field to human activity, and inexhaustible
materials for industry and labor. The passion of wealth takes the place of ambition, and the
warmth of faction is mitigated by a sense of prosperity. But in what portion of the globe shall
we meet with more fertile plains, with mightier rivers, or with more unexplored and inexhaustible
riches than in South America?

Nevertheless, South America has been unable to maintain democratic institutions. If the welfare
of nations depended on their being placed in a remote position, with an unbounded space of
habitable territory before them, the Spaniards of South America would have no reason to complain
of their fate. And although they might enjoy less prosperity than the inhabitants of the United
States, their lot might still be such as to excite the envy of some nations in Europe. There
are, however, no nations upon the face of the earth more miserable than those of South America. 

The sentiments with resulting this man advantages in proposition are excessively detailed details

Ever, unhappily, the fidelity of two other areopagite of his denier were excessively be expected.

It was the Act resolution, and one which was not prize by Aristocrat, and not until delegacy,

Godhead George Murray had prosecute Blair Castle; Swayer Drummond was making head against Bland; the
Associate of Perth was in pursuit of Loudon. A portion of transaction was exhausted with danger, that

Excessively

Same argosy was encouraged in beginning, get safe State across the frith footnote of Elver, and arrived
in Tain, where the Duke of s Perth, whom an Aristocrat had use in campaign, was ready. The men
were understand with report, and by agency, which happened hurriedly opportunely, partake over

after the dissatisfaction, owing to his entelechy of his good nature and courtesy, deposit in Lord of
Loudon'siemens host: and ought see as a era, in the opinion of the Mr. Maxwell, is an campaign. "Thus,

 What resistance can be offered by manners of so pliant a make that they have already
often yielded? What strength can even public opinion have retained, when no twenty persons
are connected by a common tie; when not a man, nor a family, nor chartered corporation, nor
class, nor free institution, has the power of representing or exerting that opinion; and when
every citizen--being equally weak, equally poor, and equally dependent--has only his personal
impotence to oppose to the organized force of the government?

The annals of France furnish nothing analogous to the condition in which that country might
then be thrown. But it may more aptly be assimilated to the times of old, and to those hideous
eras of Roman oppression, when the manners of the people were corrupted, their traditions obliterated,
their habits destroyed, their opinions shaken, and freedom, expelled from the laws, could find
no refuge in the land; when nothing protected the citizens, and the citizens no longer protected
themselves; when human nature was the sport of man, and princes wearied out the clemency of
Heaven before they exhausted the patience of their subjects. Those who hope to revive the monarchy
of Henry IV or of Louis XIV, appear to me to be afflicted with mental blindness; and when I
consider the present condition of several European nations--a condition to which all the others
tend--I am led to believe that they will soon be left with no other alternative than democratic
liberty, or the tyranny of the Caesars. *n

[Footnote n: [This prediction of the return of France to imperial despotism, and of the true
character of that despotic power, was written in 1832, and realized to the letter in 1852.]]

And indeed it is deserving of consideration, whether men are to be entirely emancipated or
entirely enslaved; whether their rights are to be made equal, or wholly taken away from them.
If the rulers of society were reduced either gradually to raise the crowd to their own level,
or to sink the citizens below that of humanity, would not the doubts of many be resolved, the
consciences of many be healed, and the community prepared to make great sacrifices with little
difficulty? In that case, the gradual growth of democratic manners and institutions should
be regarded, not as the best, but as the only means of preserving freedom; and without liking
the government of democracy, it might be adopted as the most applicable and the fairest remedy
for the present ills of society.

It is difficult to associate a people in the work of government; but it is still more difficult
to supply it with experience, and to inspire it with the feelings which it requires in order
to govern well. I grant that the caprices of democracy are perpetual; its instruments are rude;
its laws imperfect. But if it were true that soon no just medium would exist between the empire
of democracy and the dominion of a single arm, should we not rather incline towards the former
than submit voluntarily to the latter? And if complete equality be our fate, is it not better
to be levelled by free institutions than by despotic power?

Those who, after having read this book, should imagine that my intention in writing it has
been to propose the laws and manners of the Anglo-Americans for the imitation of all democratic
peoples, would commit a very great mistake; they must have paid more attention to the form
than to the substance of my ideas. My aim has been to show, by the example of America, that
laws, and especially manners, may exist which will allow a democratic people to remain free.
But I am very far from thinking that we ought to follow the example of the American democracy,
and copy the means which it has employed to attain its ends; for I am well aware of the influence
which the nature of a country and its political precedents exercise upon a constitution; and
I should regard it as a great misfortune for mankind if liberty were to exist all over the
world under the same forms.

But I am of opinion that if we do not succeed in gradually introducing democratic institutions
into France, and if we despair of imparting to the citizens those ideas and sentiments which
first prepare them for freedom, and afterwards allow them to enjoy it, there will be no independence
at all, either for the middling classes or the nobility, for the poor or for the rich, but
an equal tyranny over all; and I foresee that if the peaceable empire of the majority be not
founded amongst us in time, we shall sooner or later arrive at the unlimited authority of a
single despot.

Chapter XVIII: Future Condition Of Three Races In The United States--Part I

The Present And Probable Future Condition Of The Three Races Which Inhabit The Territory Of
The United States

The principal part of the task which I had imposed upon myself is now performed. I have shown,
as far as I was able, the laws and the manners of the American democracy. Here I might stop;
but the reader would perhaps feel that I had not satisfied his expectations.

The absolute supremacy of democracy is not all that we meet with in America; the inhabitants
of the New World may be considered from more than one point of view. In the course of this
work my subject has often led me to speak of the Indians and the Negroes; but I have never
been able to stop in order to show what place these two races occupy in the midst of the democratic
people whom I was engaged in describing. I have mentioned in what spirit, and according to
what laws, the Anglo-American Union was formed; but I could only glance at the dangers which
menace that confederation, whilst it was equally impossible for me to give a detailed account
of its chances of duration, independently of its laws and manners. When speaking of the united
republican States, I hazarded no conjectures upon the permanence of republican forms in the
New World, and when making frequent allusion to the commercial activity which reigns in the
Union, I was unable to inquire into the future condition of the Americans as a commercial people.

These topics are collaterally connected with my subject without forming a part of it; they
are American without being democratic; and to portray democracy has been my principal aim.
It was therefore necessary to postpone these questions, which I now take up as the proper termination
of my work.

The territory now occupied or claimed by the American Union spreads from the shores of the
Atlantic to those of the Pacific Ocean. On the east and west its limits are those of the continent
itself. On the south it advances nearly to the tropic, and it extends upwards to the icy regions
of the North. The human beings who are scattered over this space do not form, as in Europe,
so many branches of the same stock. Three races, naturally distinct, and, I might almost say,
hostile to each other, are discoverable amongst them at the first glance. Almost insurmountable
barriers had been raised between them by education and by law, as well as by their origin and
outward characteristics; but fortune has brought them together on the same soil, where, although
they are mixed, they do not amalgamate, and each race fulfils its destiny apart.

Amongst these widely differing families of men, the first which attracts attention, the superior
in intelligence, in power and in enjoyment, is the white or European, the man pre-eminent;
and in subordinate grades, the negro and the Indian. These two unhappy races have nothing in
common; neither birth, nor features, nor language, nor habits. Their only resemblance lies
in their misfortunes. Both of them occupy an inferior rank in the country they inhabit; both
suffer from tyranny; and if their wrongs are not the same, they originate, at any rate, with
the same authors.

If we reasoned from what passes in the world, we should almost say that the European is to
the other races of mankind, what man is to the lower animals;--he makes them subservient to
his use; and when he cannot subdue, he destroys them. Oppression has, at one stroke, deprived
the descendants of the Africans of almost all the privileges of humanity. The negro of the
United States has lost all remembrance of his country; the language which his forefathers spoke
is never heard around him; he abjured their religion and forgot their customs when he ceased
to belong to Africa, without acquiring any claim to European privileges. But he remains half
way between the two communities; sold by the one, repulsed by the other; finding not a spot
in the universe to call by the name of country, except the faint image of a home which the
shelter of his master's roof affords.

The negro has no family; woman is merely the temporary companion of his pleasures, and his
children are upon an equality with himself from the moment of their birth. Am I to call it
a proof of God's mercy or a visitation of his wrath, that man in certain states appears to
be insensible to his extreme wretchedness, and almost affects, with a depraved taste, the cause
of his misfortunes? The negro, who is plunged in this abyss of evils, scarcely feels his own
calamitous situation. Violence made him a slave, and the habit of servitude gives him the thoughts
and desires of a slave; he admires his tyrants more than he hates them, and finds his joy and
his pride in the servile imitation of those who oppress him: his understanding is degraded
to the level of his soul.

The negro enters upon slavery as soon as he is born: nay, he may have been purchased in the
womb, and have begun his slavery before he began his existence. Equally devoid of wants and
of enjoyment, and useless to himself, he learns, with his first notions of existence, that
he is the property of another, who has an interest in preserving his life, and that the care
of it does not devolve upon himself; even the power of thought appears to him a useless gift
of Providence, and he quietly enjoys the privileges of his debasement. If he becomes free,
independence is often felt by him to be a heavier burden than slavery; for having learned,
in the course of his life, to submit to everything except reason, he is too much unacquainted
with her dictates to obey them. A thousand new desires beset him, and he is destitute of the
knowledge and energy necessary to resist them: these are masters which it is necessary to contend
with, and he has learnt only to submit and obey. In short, he sinks to such a depth of wretchedness,
that while servitude brutalizes, liberty destroys him.

Oppression has been no less fatal to the Indian than to the negro race, but its effects are
different. Before the arrival of white men in the New World, the inhabitants of North America
lived quietly in their woods, enduring the vicissitudes and practising the virtues and vices
common to savage nations. The Europeans, having dispersed the Indian tribes and driven them
into the deserts, condemned them to a wandering life full of inexpressible sufferings.

Savage nations are only controlled by opinion and by custom. When the North American Indians
had lost the sentiment of attachment to their country; when their families were dispersed,
their traditions obscured, and the chain of their recollections broken; when all their habits
were changed, and their wants increased beyond measure, European tyranny rendered them more
disorderly and less civilized than they were before. The moral and physical condition of these
tribes continually grew worse, and they became more barbarous as they became more wretched.
Nevertheless, the Europeans have not been able to metamorphose the character of the Indians;
and though they have had power to destroy them, they have never been able to make them submit
to the rules of civilized society.

The lot of the negro is placed on the extreme limit of servitude, while that of the Indian
lies on the uttermost verge of liberty; and slavery does not produce more fatal effects upon
the first, than independence upon the second. The negro has lost all property in his own person,
and he cannot dispose of his existence without committing a sort of fraud: but the savage is
his own master as soon as he is able to act; parental authority is scarcely known to him; he
has never bent his will to that of any of his kind, nor learned the difference between voluntary
obedience and a shameful subjection; and the very name of law is unknown to him. To be free,
with him, signifies to escape from all the shackles of society. As he delights in this barbarous
independence, and would rather perish than sacrifice the least part of it, civilization has
little power over him.

The negro makes a thousand fruitless efforts to insinuate himself amongst men who repulse him;
he conforms to the tastes of his oppressors, adopts their opinions, and hopes by imitating
them to form a part of their community. Having been told from infancy that his race is naturally
inferior to that of the whites, he assents to the proposition and is ashamed of his own nature.
In each of his features he discovers a trace of slavery, and, if it were in his power, he would
willingly rid himself of everything that makes him what he is.

The Indian, on the contrary, has his imagination inflated with the pretended nobility of his
origin, and lives and dies in the midst of these dreams of pride. Far from desiring to conform
his habits to ours, he loves his savage life as the distinguishing mark of his race, and he
repels every advance to civilization, less perhaps from the hatred which he entertains for
it, than from a dread of resembling the Europeans. *a While he has nothing to oppose to our
perfection in the arts but the resources of the desert, to our tactics nothing but undisciplined
courage; whilst our well-digested plans are met by the spontaneous instincts of savage life,
who can wonder if he fails in this unequal contest?

[Footnote a: The native of North America retains his opinions and the most insignificant of
his habits with a degree of tenacity which has no parallel in history. For more than two hundred
years the wandering tribes of North America have had daily intercourse with the whites, and
they have never derived from them either a custom or an idea. Yet the Europeans have exercised
a powerful influence over the savages: they have made them more licentious, but not more European.
In the summer of 1831 I happened to be beyond Lake Michigan, at a place called Green Bay, which
serves as the extreme frontier between the United States and the Indians on the north-western
side. Here I became acquainted with an American officer, Major H., who, after talking to me
at length on the inflexibility of the Indian character, related the following fact:--"I formerly
knew a young Indian," said he, "who had been educated at a college in New England, where he
had greatly distinguished himself, and had acquired the external appearance of a member of
civilized society. When the war broke out between ourselves and the English in 1810, I saw
this young man again; he was serving in our army, at the head of the warriors of his tribe,
for the Indians were admitted amongst the ranks of the Americans, upon condition that they
would abstain from their horrible custom of scalping their victims. On the evening of the battle
of . . ., C. came and sat himself down by the fire of our bivouac. I asked him what had been
his fortune that day: he related his exploits; and growing warm and animated by the recollection
of them, he concluded by suddenly opening the breast of his coat, saying, 'You must not betray
me--see here!' And I actually beheld," said the Major, "between his body and his shirt, the
skin and hair of an English head, still dripping with gore."]

The negro, who earnestly desires to mingle his race with that of the European, cannot effect
if; while the Indian, who might succeed to a certain extent, disdains to make the attempt.
The servility of the one dooms him to slavery, the pride of the other to death.

I remember that while I was travelling through the forests which still cover the State of Alabama,
I arrived one day at the log house of a pioneer. I did not wish to penetrate into the dwelling
of the American, but retired to rest myself for a while on the margin of a spring, which was
not far off, in the woods. While I was in this place (which was in the neighborhood of the
Creek territory), an Indian woman appeared, followed by a negress, and holding by the hand
a little white girl of five or six years old, whom I took to be the daughter of the pioneer.
A sort of barbarous luxury set off the costume of the Indian; rings of metal were hanging from
her nostrils and ears; her hair, which was adorned with glass beads, fell loosely upon her
shoulders; and I saw that she was not married, for she still wore that necklace of shells which
the bride always deposits on the nuptial couch. The negress was clad in squalid European garments.
They all three came and seated themselves upon the banks of the fountain; and the young Indian,
taking the child in her arms, lavished upon her such fond caresses as mothers give; while the
negress endeavored by various little artifices to attract the attention of the young Creole.

The child displayed in her slightest gestures a consciousness of superiority which formed a
strange contrast with her infantine weakness; as if she received the attentions of her companions
with a sort of condescension. The negress was seated on the ground before her mistress, watching
her smallest desires, and apparently divided between strong affection for the child and servile
fear; whilst the savage displayed, in the midst of her tenderness, an air of freedom and of
pride which was almost ferocious. I had approached the group, and I contemplated them in silence;
but my curiosity was probably displeasing to the Indian woman, for she suddenly rose, pushed
the child roughly from her, and giving me an angry look plunged into the thicket. I had often
chanced to see individuals met together in the same place, who belonged to the three races
of men which people North America. I had perceived from many different results the preponderance
of the whites. But in the picture which I have just been describing there was something peculiarly
touching; a bond of affection here united the oppressors with the oppressed, and the effort
of nature to bring them together rendered still more striking the immense distance placed between
them by prejudice and by law.

The Present And Probable Future Condition Of The Indian Tribes Which Inhabit The Territory
Possessed By The Union

Gradual disappearance of the native tribes--Manner in which it takes place--Miseries accompanying
the forced migrations of the Indians--The savages of North America had only two ways of escaping
destruction; war or civilization--They are no longer able to make war--Reasons why they refused
to become civilized when it was in their power, and why they cannot become so now that they
desire it--Instance of the Creeks and Cherokees--Policy of the particular States towards these
Indians--Policy of the Federal Government.

None of the Indian tribes which formerly inhabited the territory of New England--the Naragansetts,
the Mohicans, the Pecots--have any existence but in the recollection of man. The Lenapes, who
received William Penn, a hundred and fifty years ago, upon the banks of the Delaware, have
disappeared; and I myself met with the last of the Iroquois, who were begging alms. The nations
I have mentioned formerly covered the country to the sea-coast; but a traveller at the present
day must penetrate more than a hundred leagues into the interior of the continent to find an
Indian. Not only have these wild tribes receded, but they are destroyed; *b and as they give
way or perish, an immense and increasing people fills their place. There is no instance upon
record of so prodigious a growth, or so rapid a destruction: the manner in which the latter
change takes place is not difficult to describe.

[Footnote b: In the thirteen original States there are only 6,273 Indians remaining. (See Legislative
Documents, 20th Congress, No. 117, p. 90.) [The decrease in now far greater, and is verging
on extinction. See page 360 of this volume.]]

When the Indians were the sole inhabitants of the wilds from whence they have since been expelled,
their wants were few. Their arms were of their own manufacture, their only drink was the water
of the brook, and their clothes consisted of the skins of animals, whose flesh furnished them
with food.

The Europeans introduced amongst the savages of North America fire-arms, ardent spirits, and
iron: they taught them to exchange for manufactured stuffs, the rough garments which had previously
satisfied their untutored simplicity. Having acquired new tastes, without the arts by which
they could be gratified, the Indians were obliged to have recourse to the workmanship of the
whites; but in return for their productions the savage had nothing to offer except the rich
furs which still abounded in his woods. Hence the chase became necessary, not merely to provide
for his subsistence, but in order to procure the only objects of barter which he could furnish
to Europe. *c Whilst the wants of the natives were thus increasing, their resources continued
to diminish.

[Footnote c: Messrs. Clarke and Cass, in their Report to Congress on February 4, 1829, p. 23,
expressed themselves thus:--"The time when the Indians generally could supply themselves with
food and clothing, without any of the articles of civilized life, has long since passed away.
The more remote tribes, beyond the Mississippi, who live where immense herds of buffalo are
yet to be found and who follow those animals in their periodical migrations, could more easily
than any others recur to the habits of their ancestors, and live without the white man or any
of his manufactures. But the buffalo is constantly receding. The smaller animals, the bear,
the deer, the beaver, the otter, the muskrat, etc., principally minister to the comfort and
support of the Indians; and these cannot be taken without guns, ammunition, and traps. Among
the Northwestern Indians particularly, the labor of supplying a family with food is excessive.
Day after day is spent by the hunter without success, and during this interval his family must
subsist upon bark or roots, or perish. Want and misery are around them and among them. Many
die every winter from actual starvation."

The Indians will not live as Europeans live, and yet they can neither subsist without them,
nor exactly after the fashion of their fathers. This is demonstrated by a fact which I likewise
give upon official authority. Some Indians of a tribe on the banks of Lake Superior had killed
a European; the American government interdicted all traffic with the tribe to which the guilty
parties belonged, until they were delivered up to justice. This measure had the desired effect.]

From the moment when a European settlement is formed in the neighborhood of the territory occupied
by the Indians, the beasts of chase take the alarm. *d Thousands of savages, wandering in the
forests and destitute of any fixed dwelling, did not disturb them; but as soon as the continuous
sounds of European labor are heard in their neighborhood, they begin to flee away, and retire
to the West, where their instinct teaches them that they will find deserts of immeasurable
extent. "The buffalo is constantly receding," say Messrs. Clarke and Cass in their Report of
the year 1829; "a few years since they approached the base of the Alleghany; and a few years
hence they may even be rare upon the immense plains which extend to the base of the Rocky Mountains."
I have been assured that this effect of the approach of the whites is often felt at two hundred
leagues' distance from their frontier. Their influence is thus exerted over tribes whose name
is unknown to them; and who suffer the evils of usurpation long before they are acquainted
with the authors of their distress. *e

[Footnote d: "Five years ago," (says Volney in his "Tableau des Etats-Unis," p. 370) "in going
from Vincennes to Kaskaskia, a territory which now forms part of the State of Illinois, but
which at the time I mention was completely wild (1797), you could not cross a prairie without
seeing herds of from four to five hundred buffaloes. There are now none remaining; they swam
across the Mississippi to escape from the hunters, and more particularly from the bells of
the American cows."]

[Footnote e: The truth of what I here advance may be easily proved by consulting the tabular
statement of Indian tribes inhabiting the United States and their territories. (Legislative
Documents, 20th Congress, No. 117, pp. 90-105.) It is there shown that the tribes in the centre
of America are rapidly decreasing, although the Europeans are still at a considerable distance
from them.]

Bold adventurers soon penetrate into the country the Indians have deserted, and when they have
advanced about fifteen or twenty leagues from the extreme frontiers of the whites, they begin
to build habitations for civilized beings in the midst of the wilderness. This is done without
difficulty, as the territory of a hunting-nation is ill-defined; it is the common property
of the tribe, and belongs to no one in particular, so that individual interests are not concerned
in the protection of any part of it.

A few European families, settled in different situations at a considerable distance from each
other, soon drive away the wild animals which remain between their places of abode. The Indians,
who had previously lived in a sort of abundance, then find it difficult to subsist, and still
more difficult to procure the articles of barter which they stand in need of.

To drive away their game is to deprive them of the means of existence, as effectually as if
the fields of our agriculturists were stricken with barrenness; and they are reduced, like
famished wolves, to prowl through the forsaken woods in quest of prey. Their instinctive love
of their country attaches them to the soil which gave them birth, *f even after it has ceased
to yield anything but misery and death. At length they are compelled to acquiesce, and to depart:
they follow the traces of the elk, the buffalo, and the beaver, and are guided by these wild
animals in the choice of their future country. Properly speaking, therefore, it is not the
Europeans who drive away the native inhabitants of America; it is famine which compels them
to recede; a happy distinction which had escaped the casuists of former times, and for which
we are indebted to modern discovery!

[Footnote f: "The Indians," say Messrs. Clarke and Cass in their Report to Congress, p. 15,
"are attached to their country by the same feelings which bind us to ours; and, besides, there
are certain superstitious notions connected with the alienation of what the Great Spirit gave
to their ancestors, which operate strongly upon the tribes who have made few or no cessions,
but which are gradually weakened as our intercourse with them is extended. 'We will not sell
the spot which contains the bones of our fathers,' is almost always the first answer to a proposition
for a sale."]

It is impossible to conceive the extent of the sufferings which attend these forced emigrations.
They are undertaken by a people already exhausted and reduced; and the countries to which the
newcomers betake themselves are inhabited by other tribes which receive them with jealous hostility.
Hunger is in the rear; war awaits them, and misery besets them on all sides. In the hope of
escaping from such a host of enemies, they separate, and each individual endeavors to procure
the means of supporting his existence in solitude and secrecy, living in the immensity of the
desert like an outcast in civilized society. The social tie, which distress had long since
weakened, is then dissolved; they have lost their country, and their people soon desert them:
their very families are obliterated; the names they bore in common are forgotten, their language
perishes, and all traces of their origin disappear. Their nation has ceased to exist, except
in the recollection of the antiquaries of America and a few of the learned of Europe.

I should be sorry to have my reader suppose that I am coloring the picture too highly; I saw
with my own eyes several of the cases of misery which I have been describing; and I was the
witness of sufferings which I have not the power to portray.

At the end of the year 1831, whilst I was on the left bank of the Mississippi at a place named
by Europeans, Memphis, there arrived a numerous band of Choctaws (or Chactas, as they are called
by the French in Louisiana). These savages had left their country, and were endeavoring to
gain the right bank of the Mississippi, where they hoped to find an asylum which had been promised
them by the American government. It was then the middle of winter, and the cold was unusually
severe; the snow had frozen hard upon the ground, and the river was drifting huge masses of
ice. The Indians had their families with them; and they brought in their train the wounded
and sick, with children newly born, and old men upon the verge of death. They possessed neither
tents nor wagons, but only their arms and some provisions. I saw them embark to pass the mighty
river, and never will that solemn spectacle fade from my remembrance. No cry, no sob was heard
amongst the assembled crowd; all were silent. Their calamities were of ancient date, and they
knew them to be irremediable. The Indians had all stepped into the bark which was to carry
them across, but their dogs remained upon the bank. As soon as these animals perceived that
their masters were finally leaving the shore, they set up a dismal howl, and, plunging all
together into the icy waters of the Mississippi, they swam after the boat.

The ejectment of the Indians very often takes place at the present day, in a regular, and,
as it were, a legal manner. When the European population begins to approach the limit of the
desert inhabited by a savage tribe, the government of the United States usually dispatches
envoys to them, who assemble the Indians in a large plain, and having first eaten and drunk
with them, accost them in the following manner: "What have you to do in the land of your fathers?
Before long, you must dig up their bones in order to live. In what respect is the country you
inhabit better than another? Are there no woods, marshes, or prairies, except where you dwell?
And can you live nowhere but under your own sun? Beyond those mountains which you see at the
horizon, beyond the lake which bounds your territory on the west, there lie vast countries
where beasts of chase are found in great abundance; sell your lands to us, and go to live happily
in those solitudes." After holding this language, they spread before the eyes of the Indians
firearms, woollen garments, kegs of brandy, glass necklaces, bracelets of tinsel, earrings,
and looking-glasses. *g If, when they have beheld all these riches, they still hesitate, it
is insinuated that they have not the means of refusing their required consent, and that the
government itself will not long have the power of protecting them in their rights. What are
they to do? Half convinced, and half compelled, they go to inhabit new deserts, where the importunate
whites will not let them remain ten years in tranquillity. In this manner do the Americans
obtain, at a very low price, whole provinces, which the richest sovereigns of Europe could
not purchase. *h

[Footnote g: See, in the Legislative Documents of Congress (Doc. 117), the narrative of what
takes place on these occasions. This curious passage is from the above-mentioned report, made
to Congress by Messrs. Clarke and Cass in February, 1829. Mr. Cass is now the Secretary of War.

"The Indians," says the report, "reach the treaty-ground poor and almost naked. Large quantities
of goods are taken there by the traders, and are seen and examined by the Indians. The women
and children become importunate to have their wants supplied, and their influence is soon exerted
to induce a sale. Their improvidence is habitual and unconquerable. The gratification of his
immediate wants and desires is the ruling passion of an Indian. The expectation of future advantages
seldom produces much effect. The experience of the past is lost, and the prospects of the future
disregarded. It would be utterly hopeless to demand a cession of land, unless the means were
at hand of gratifying their immediate wants; and when their condition and circumstances are
fairly considered, it ought not to surprise us that they are so anxious to relieve themselves."]

[Footnote h: On May 19, 1830, Mr. Edward Everett affirmed before the House of Representatives,
that the Americans had already acquired by treaty, to the east and west of the Mississippi,
230,000,000 of acres. In 1808 the Osages gave up 48,000,000 acres for an annual payment of
$1,000. In 1818 the Quapaws yielded up 29,000,000 acres for $4,000. They reserved for themselves
a territory of 1,000,000 acres for a hunting-ground. A solemn oath was taken that it should
be respected: but before long it was invaded like the rest. Mr. Bell, in his Report of the
Committee on Indian Affairs, February 24, 1830, has these words:--"To pay an Indian tribe what
their ancient hunting-grounds are worth to them, after the game is fled or destroyed, as a
mode of appropriating wild lands claimed by Indians, has been found more convenient, and certainly
it is more agreeable to the forms of justice, as well as more merciful, than to assert the
possession of them by the sword. Thus the practice of buying Indian titles is but the substitute
which humanity and expediency have imposed, in place of the sword, in arriving at the actual
enjoyment of property claimed by the right of discovery, and sanctioned by the natural superiority
allowed to the claims of civilized communities over those of savage tribes. Up to the present
time so invariable has been the operation of certain causes, first in diminishing the value
of forest lands to the Indians, and secondly in disposing them to sell readily, that the plan
of buying their right of occupancy has never threatened to retard, in any perceptible degree,
the prosperity of any of the States." (Legislative Documents, 21st Congress, No. 227, p. 6.)]

Chapter XVIII: Future Condition Of Three Races--Part II

These are great evils; and it must be added that they appear to me to be irremediable. I believe
that the Indian nations of North America are doomed to perish; and that whenever the Europeans
shall be established on the shores of the Pacific Ocean, that race of men will be no more.
*i The Indians had only the two alternatives of war or civilization; in other words, they must
either have destroyed the Europeans or become their equals.

[Footnote i: This seems, indeed, to be the opinion of almost all American statesmen. "Judging
of the future by the past," says Mr. Cass, "we cannot err in anticipating a progressive diminution
of their numbers, and their eventual extinction, unless our border should become stationary,
and they be removed beyond it, or unless some radical change should take place in the principles
of our intercourse with them, which it is easier to hope for than to expect."]

At the first settlement of the colonies they might have found it possible, by uniting their
forces, to deliver themselves from the small bodies of strangers who landed on their continent.
*j They several times attempted to do it, and were on the point of succeeding; but the disproportion
of their resources, at the present day, when compared with those of the whites, is too great
to allow such an enterprise to be thought of. Nevertheless, there do arise from time to time
among the Indians men of penetration, who foresee the final destiny which awaits the native
population, and who exert themselves to unite all the tribes in common hostility to the Europeans;
but their efforts are unavailing. Those tribes which are in the neighborhood of the whites,
are too much weakened to offer an effectual resistance; whilst the others, giving way to that
childish carelessness of the morrow which characterizes savage life, wait for the near approach
of danger before they prepare to meet it; some are unable, the others are unwilling, to exert
themselves.

[Footnote j: Amongst other warlike enterprises, there was one of the Wampanaogs, and other
confederate tribes, under Metacom in 1675, against the colonists of New England; the English
were also engaged in war in Virginia in 1622.]

It is easy to foresee that the Indians will never conform to civilization; or that it will
be too late, whenever they may be inclined to make the experiment.

Civilization is the result of a long social process which takes place in the same spot, and
is handed down from one generation to another, each one profiting by the experience of the
last. Of all nations, those submit to civilization with the most difficulty which habitually
live by the chase. Pastoral tribes, indeed, often change their place of abode; but they follow
a regular order in their migrations, and often return again to their old stations, whilst the
dwelling of the hunter varies with that of the animals he pursues.

Several attempts have been made to diffuse knowledge amongst the Indians, without controlling
their wandering propensities; by the Jesuits in Canada, and by the Puritans in New England;
*k but none of these endeavors were crowned by any lasting success. Civilization began in the
cabin, but it soon retired to expire in the woods. The great error of these legislators of
the Indians was their not understanding that, in order to succeed in civilizing a people, it
is first necessary to fix it; which cannot be done without inducing it to cultivate the soil;
the Indians ought in the first place to have been accustomed to agriculture. But not only are
they destitute of this indispensable preliminary to civilization, they would even have great
difficulty in acquiring it. Men who have once abandoned themselves to the restless and adventurous
life of the hunter, feel an insurmountable disgust for the constant and regular labor which
tillage requires. We see this proved in the bosom of our own society; but it is far more visible
among peoples whose partiality for the chase is a part of their national character.

[Footnote k: See the "Histoire de la Nouvelle France," by Charlevoix, and the work entitled
"Lettres edifiantes."]

Independently of this general difficulty, there is another, which applies peculiarly to the
Indians; they consider labor not merely as an evil, but as a disgrace; so that their pride
prevents them from becoming civilized, as much as their indolence. *l

[Footnote l: "In all the tribes," says Volney, in his "Tableau des Etats-Unis," p. 423, "there
still exists a generation of old warriors, who cannot forbear, when they see their countrymen
using the hoe, from exclaiming against the degradation of ancient manners, and asserting that
the savages owe their decline to these innovations; adding, that they have only to return to
their primitive habits in order to recover their power and their glory."]

There is no Indian so wretched as not to retain under his hut of bark a lofty idea of his personal
worth; he considers the cares of industry and labor as degrading occupations; he compares the
husbandman to the ox which traces the furrow; and even in our most ingenious handicraft, he
can see nothing but the labor of slaves. Not that he is devoid of admiration for the power
and intellectual greatness of the whites; but although the result of our efforts surprises
him, he contemns the means by which we obtain it; and while he acknowledges our ascendancy,
he still believes in his superiority. War and hunting are the only pursuits which appear to
him worthy to be the occupations of a man. *m The Indian, in the dreary solitude of his woods,
cherishes the same ideas, the same opinions as the noble of the Middle ages in his castle,
and he only requires to become a conqueror to complete the resemblance; thus, however strange
it may seem, it is in the forests of the New World, and not amongst the Europeans who people
its coasts, that the ancient prejudices of Europe are still in existence.

[Footnote m: The following description occurs in an official document: "Until a young man has
been engaged with an enemy, and has performed some acts of valor, he gains no consideration,
but is regarded nearly as a woman. In their great war-dances all the warriors in succession
strike the post, as it is called, and recount their exploits. On these occasions their auditory
consists of the kinsmen, friends, and comrades of the narrator. The profound impression which
his discourse produces on them is manifested by the silent attention it receives, and by the
loud shouts which hail its termination. The young man who finds himself at such a meeting without
anything to recount is very unhappy; and instances have sometimes occurred of young warriors,
whose passions had been thus inflamed, quitting the war-dance suddenly, and going off alone
to seek for trophies which they might exhibit, and adventures which they might be allowed to
relate."]

More than once, in the course of this work, I have endeavored to explain the prodigious influence
which the social condition appears to exercise upon the laws and the manners of men; and I
beg to add a few words on the same subject.

When I perceive the resemblance which exists between the political institutions of our ancestors,
the Germans, and of the wandering tribes of North America; between the customs described by
Tacitus, and those of which I have sometimes been a witness, I cannot help thinking that the
same cause has brought about the same results in both hemispheres; and that in the midst of
the apparent diversity of human affairs, a certain number of primary facts may be discovered,
from which all the others are derived. In what we usually call the German institutions, then,
I am inclined only to perceive barbarian habits; and the opinions of savages in what we style
feudal principles.

However strongly the vices and prejudices of the North American Indians may be opposed to their
becoming agricultural and civilized, necessity sometimes obliges them to it. Several of the
Southern nations, and amongst others the Cherokees and the Creeks, *n were surrounded by Europeans,
who had landed on the shores of the Atlantic; and who, either descending the Ohio or proceeding
up the Mississippi, arrived simultaneously upon their borders. These tribes have not been driven
from place to place, like their Northern brethren; but they have been gradually enclosed within
narrow limits, like the game within the thicket, before the huntsmen plunge into the interior.
The Indians who were thus placed between civilization and death, found themselves obliged to
live by ignominious labor like the whites. They took to agriculture, and without entirely forsaking
their old habits or manners, sacrificed only as much as was necessary to their existence.

[Footnote n: These nations are now swallowed up in the States of Georgia, Tennessee, Alabama,
and Mississippi. There were formerly in the South four great nations (remnants of which still
exist), the Choctaws, the Chickasaws, the Creeks, and the Cherokees. The remnants of these
four nations amounted, in 1830, to about 75,000 individuals. It is computed that there are
now remaining in the territory occupied or claimed by the Anglo-American Union about 300,000
Indians. (See Proceedings of the Indian Board in the City of New York.) The official documents
supplied to Congress make the number amount to 313,130. The reader who is curious to know the
names and numerical strength of all the tribes which inhabit the Anglo-American territory should
consult the documents I refer to. *o

[Footnote o: I brought back with me to France one or two copies of this singular publication.]

The growth of European habits has been remarkably accelerated among these Indians by the mixed
race which has sprung up. *p Deriving intelligence from their father's side, without entirely
losing the savage customs of the mother, the half-blood forms the natural link between civilization
and barbarism. Wherever this race has multiplied the savage state has become modified, and
a great change has taken place in the manners of the people. *q

[Footnote p: See in the Report of the Committee on Indian Affairs, 21st Congress, No. 227,
p. 23, the reasons for the multiplication of Indians of mixed blood among the Cherokees. The
principal cause dates from the War of Independence. Many Anglo-Americans of Georgia, having
taken the side of England, were obliged to retreat among the Indians, where they married.]

[Footnote q: Unhappily the mixed race has been less numerous and less influential in North
America than in any other country. The American continent was peopled by two great nations
of Europe, the French and the English. The former were not slow in connecting themselves with
the daughters of the natives, but there was an unfortunate affinity between the Indian character
and their own: instead of giving the tastes and habits of civilized life to the savages, the
French too often grew passionately fond of the state of wild freedom they found them in. They
became the most dangerous of the inhabitants of the desert, and won the friendship of the Indian
by exaggerating his vices and his virtues. M. de Senonville, the governor of Canada, wrote
thus to Louis XIV in 1685: "It has long been believed that in order to civilize the savages
we ought to draw them nearer to us. But there is every reason to suppose we have been mistaken.
Those which have been brought into contact with us have not become French, and the French who
have lived among them are changed into savages, affecting to dress and live like them." ("History
of New France," by Charlevoix, vol. ii., p. 345.) The Englishman, on the contrary, continuing
obstinately attached to the customs and the most insignificant habits of his forefathers, has
remained in the midst of the American solitudes just what he was in the bosom of European cities;
he would not allow of any communication with savages whom he despised, and avoided with care
the union of his race with theirs. Thus while the French exercised no salutary influence over
the Indians, the English have always remained alien from them.]

The success of the Cherokees proves that the Indians are capable of civilization, but it does
not prove that they will succeed in it. This difficulty which the Indians find in submitting
to civilization proceeds from the influence of a general cause, which it is almost impossible
for them to escape. An attentive survey of history demonstrates that, in general, barbarous
nations have raised themselves to civilization by degrees, and by their own efforts. Whenever
they derive knowledge from a foreign people, they stood towards it in the relation of conquerors,
and not of a conquered nation. When the conquered nation is enlightened, and the conquerors
are half savage, as in the case of the invasion of Rome by the Northern nations or that of
China by the Mongols, the power which victory bestows upon the barbarian is sufficient to keep
up his importance among civilized men, and permit him to rank as their equal, until he becomes
their rival: the one has might on his side, the other has intelligence; the former admires
the knowledge and the arts of the conquered, the latter envies the power of the conquerors.
The barbarians at length admit civilized man into their palaces, and he in turn opens his schools
to the barbarians. But when the side on which the physical force lies, also possesses an intellectual
preponderance, the conquered party seldom become civilized; it retreats, or is destroyed. It
may therefore be said, in a general way, that savages go forth in arms to seek knowledge, but
that they do not receive it when it comes to them.

If the Indian tribes which now inhabit the heart of the continent could summon up energy enough
to attempt to civilize themselves, they might possibly succeed. Superior already to the barbarous
nations which surround them, they would gradually gain strength and experience, and when the
Europeans should appear upon their borders, they would be in a state, if not to maintain their
independence, at least to assert their right to the soil, and to incorporate themselves with
the conquerors. But it is the misfortune of Indians to be brought into contact with a civilized
people, which is also (it must be owned) the most avaricious nation on the globe, whilst they
are still semi-barbarian: to find despots in their instructors, and to receive knowledge from
the hand of oppression. Living in the freedom of the woods, the North American Indian was destitute,
but he had no feeling of inferiority towards anyone; as soon, however, as he desires to penetrate
into the social scale of the whites, he takes the lowest rank in society, for he enters, ignorant
and poor, within the pale of science and wealth. After having led a life of agitation, beset
with evils and dangers, but at the same time filled with proud emotions, *r he is obliged to
submit to a wearisome, obscure, and degraded state; and to gain the bread which nourishes him
by hard and ignoble labor; such are in his eyes the only results of which civilization can
boast: and even this much he is not sure to obtain.

[Footnote r: There is in the adventurous life of the hunter a certain irresistible charm, which
seizes the heart of man and carries him away in spite of reason and experience. This is plainly
shown by the memoirs of Tanner. Tanner is a European who was carried away at the age of six
by the Indians, and has remained thirty years with them in the woods. Nothing can be conceived
more appalling that the miseries which he describes. He tells us of tribes without a chief,
families without a nation to call their own, men in a state of isolation, wrecks of powerful
tribes wandering at random amid the ice and snow and desolate solitudes of Canada. Hunger and
cold pursue them; every day their life is in jeopardy. Amongst these men, manners have lost
their empire, traditions are without power. They become more and more savage. Tanner shared
in all these miseries; he was aware of his European origin; he was not kept away from the whites
by force; on the contrary, he came every year to trade with them, entered their dwellings,
and witnessed their enjoyments; he knew that whenever he chose to return to civilized life
he was perfectly able to do so--and he remained thirty years in the deserts. When he came into
civilized society he declared that the rude existence which he described, had a secret charm
for him which he was unable to define: he returned to it again and again: at length he abandoned
it with poignant regret; and when he was at length fixed among the whites, several of his children
refused to share his tranquil and easy situation. I saw Tanner myself at the lower end of Lake
Superior; he seemed to me to be more like a savage than a civilized being. His book is written
without either taste or order; but he gives, even unconsciously, a lively picture of the prejudices,
the passions, the vices, and, above all, of the destitution in which he lived.]

When the Indians undertake to imitate their European neighbors, and to till the earth like
the settlers, they are immediately exposed to a very formidable competition. The white man
is skilled in the craft of agriculture; the Indian is a rough beginner in an art with which
he is unacquainted. The former reaps abundant crops without difficulty, the latter meets with
a thousand obstacles in raising the fruits of the earth.

The European is placed amongst a population whose wants he knows and partakes. The savage is
isolated in the midst of a hostile people, with whose manners, language, and laws he is imperfectly
acquainted, but without whose assistance he cannot live. He can only procure the materials
of comfort by bartering his commodities against the goods of the European, for the assistance
of his countrymen is wholly insufficient to supply his wants. When the Indian wishes to sell
the produce of his labor, he cannot always meet with a purchaser, whilst the European readily
finds a market; and the former can only produce at a considerable cost that which the latter
vends at a very low rate. Thus the Indian has no sooner escaped those evils to which barbarous
nations are exposed, than he is subjected to the still greater miseries of civilized communities;
and he finds is scarcely less difficult to live in the midst of our abundance, than in the
depth of his own wilderness.

He has not yet lost the habits of his erratic life; the traditions of his fathers and his passion
for the chase are still alive within him. The wild enjoyments which formerly animated him in
the woods, painfully excite his troubled imagination; and his former privations appear to be
less keen, his former perils less appalling. He contrasts the independence which he possessed
amongst his equals with the servile position which he occupies in civilized society. On the
other hand, the solitudes which were so long his free home are still at hand; a few hours'
march will bring him back to them once more. The whites offer him a sum, which seems to him
to be considerable, for the ground which he has begun to clear. This money of the Europeans
may possibly furnish him with the means of a happy and peaceful subsistence in remoter regions;
and he quits the plough, resumes his native arms, and returns to the wilderness forever. *s
The condition of the Creeks and Cherokees, to which I have already alluded, sufficiently corroborates
the truth of this deplorable picture.

[Footnote s: The destructive influence of highly civilized nations upon others which are less
so, has been exemplified by the Europeans themselves. About a century ago the French founded
the town of Vincennes up on the Wabash, in the middle of the desert; and they lived there in
great plenty until the arrival of the American settlers, who first ruined the previous inhabitants
by their competition, and afterwards purchased their lands at a very low rate. At the time
when M. de Volney, from whom I borrow these details, passed through Vincennes, the number of
the French was reduced to a hundred individuals, most of whom were about to pass over to Louisiana
or to Canada. These French settlers were worthy people, but idle and uninstructed: they had
contracted many of the habits of savages. The Americans, who were perhaps their inferiors,
in a moral point of view, were immeasurably superior to them in intelligence: they were industrious,
well informed, rich, and accustomed to govern their own community.

I myself saw in Canada, where the intellectual difference between the two races is less striking,
that the English are the masters of commerce and manufacture in the Canadian country, that
they spread on all sides, and confine the French within limits which scarcely suffice to contain
them. In like manner, in Louisiana, almost all activity in commerce and manufacture centres
in the hands of the Anglo-Americans.

But the case of Texas is still more striking: the State of Texas is a part of Mexico, and lies
upon the frontier between that country and the United States. In the course of the last few
years the Anglo-Americans have penetrated into this province, which is still thinly peopled;
they purchase land, they produce the commodities of the country, and supplant the original
population. It may easily be foreseen that if Mexico takes no steps to check this change, the
province of Texas will very shortly cease to belong to that government.

If the different degrees--comparatively so slight--which exist in European civilization produce
results of such magnitude, the consequences which must ensue from the collision of the most
perfect European civilization with Indian savages may readily be conceived.]

The Indians, in the little which they have done, have unquestionably displayed as much natural
genius as the peoples of Europe in their most important designs; but nations as well as men
require time to learn, whatever may be their intelligence and their zeal. Whilst the savages
were engaged in the work of civilization, the Europeans continued to surround them on every
side, and to confine them within narrower limits; the two races gradually met, and they are
now in immediate juxtaposition to each other. The Indian is already superior to his barbarous
parent, but he is still very far below his white neighbor. With their resources and acquired
knowledge, the Europeans soon appropriated to themselves most of the advantages which the natives
might have derived from the possession of the soil; they have settled in the country, they
have purchased land at a very low rate or have occupied it by force, and the Indians have been
ruined by a competition which they had not the means of resisting. They were isolated in their
own country, and their race only constituted a colony of troublesome aliens in the midst of
a numerous and domineering people. *t

[Footnote t: See in the Legislative Documents (21st Congress, No. 89) instances of excesses
of every kind committed by the whites upon the territory of the Indians, either in taking possession
of a part of their lands, until compelled to retire by the troops of Congress, or carrying
off their cattle, burning their houses, cutting down their corn, and doing violence to their
persons. It appears, nevertheless, from all these documents that the claims of the natives
are constantly protected by the government from the abuse of force. The Union has a representative
agent continually employed to reside among the Indians; and the report of the Cherokee agent,
which is among the documents I have referred to, is almost always favorable to the Indians.
"The intrusion of whites," he says, "upon the lands of the Cherokees would cause ruin to the
poor, helpless, and inoffensive inhabitants." And he further remarks upon the attempt of the
State of Georgia to establish a division line for the purpose of limiting the boundaries of
the Cherokees, that the line drawn having been made by the whites, and entirely upon ex parte
evidence of their several rights, was of no validity whatever.]

Washington said in one of his messages to Congress, "We are more enlightened and more powerful
than the Indian nations, we are therefore bound in honor to treat them with kindness and even
with generosity." But this virtuous and high-minded policy has not been followed. The rapacity
of the settlers is usually backed by the tyranny of the government. Although the Cherokees
and the Creeks are established upon the territory which they inhabited before the settlement
of the Europeans, and although the Americans have frequently treated with them as with foreign
nations, the surrounding States have not consented to acknowledge them as independent peoples,
and attempts have been made to subject these children of the woods to Anglo-American magistrates,
laws, and customs. *u Destitution had driven these unfortunate Indians to civilization, and
oppression now drives them back to their former condition: many of them abandon the soil which
they had begun to clear, and return to their savage course of life.

[Footnote u: In 1829 the State of Alabama divided the Creek territory into counties, and subjected
the Indian population to the power of European magistrates.

Chapter XVIII: Future Condition Of Three Races--Part III

In 1830 the State of Mississippi assimilated the Choctaws and Chickasaws to the white population,
and declared that any of them that should take the title of chief would be punished by a fine
of $1,000 and a year's imprisonment. When these laws were enforced upon the Choctaws, who inhabited
that district, the tribe assembled, their chief communicated to them the intentions of the
whites, and read to them some of the laws to which it was intended that they should submit;
and they unanimously declared that it was better at once to retreat again into the wilds.]

If we consider the tyrannical measures which have been adopted by the legislatures of the Southern
States, the conduct of their Governors, and the decrees of their courts of justice, we shall
be convinced that the entire expulsion of the Indians is the final result to which the efforts
of their policy are directed. The Americans of that part of the Union look with jealousy upon
the aborigines, *v they are aware that these tribes have not yet lost the traditions of savage
life, and before civilization has permanently fixed them to the soil, it is intended to force
them to recede by reducing them to despair. The Creeks and Cherokees, oppressed by the several
States, have appealed to the central government, which is by no means insensible to their misfortunes,
and is sincerely desirous of saving the remnant of the natives, and of maintaining them in
the free possession of that territory, which the Union is pledged to respect. *w But the several
States oppose so formidable a resistance to the execution of this design, that the government
is obliged to consent to the extirpation of a few barbarous tribes in order not to endanger
the safety of the American Union.

[Footnote v: The Georgians, who are so much annoyed by the proximity of the Indians, inhabit
a territory which does not at present contain more than seven inhabitants to the square mile.
In France there are one hundred and sixty-two inhabitants to the same extent of country.]

[Footnote w: In 1818 Congress appointed commissioners to visit the Arkansas Territory, accompanied
by a deputation of Creeks, Choctaws, and Chickasaws. This expedition was commanded by Messrs.
Kennerly, M'Coy, Wash Hood, and John Bell. See the different reports of the commissioners,
and their journal, in the Documents of Congress, No. 87, House of Representatives.]

But the federal government, which is not able to protect the Indians, would fain mitigate the
hardships of their lot; and, with this intention, proposals have been made to transport them
into more remote regions at the public cost.

Between the thirty-third and thirty-seventh degrees of north latitude, a vast tract of country
lies, which has taken the name of Arkansas, from the principal river that waters its extent.
It is bounded on the one side by the confines of Mexico, on the other by the Mississippi. Numberless
streams cross it in every direction; the climate is mild, and the soil productive, but it is
only inhabited by a few wandering hordes of savages. The government of the Union wishes to
transport the broken remnants of the indigenous population of the South to the portion of this
country which is nearest to Mexico, and at a great distance from the American settlements.

We were assured, towards the end of the year 1831, that 10,000 Indians had already gone down
to the shores of the Arkansas; and fresh detachments were constantly following them; but Congress
has been unable to excite a unanimous determination in those whom it is disposed to protect.
Some, indeed, are willing to quit the seat of oppression, but the most enlightened members
of the community refuse to abandon their recent dwellings and their springing crops; they are
of opinion that the work of civilization, once interrupted, will never be resumed; they fear
that those domestic habits which have been so recently contracted, may be irrevocably lost
in the midst of a country which is still barbarous, and where nothing is prepared for the subsistence
of an agricultural people; they know that their entrance into those wilds will be opposed by
inimical hordes, and that they have lost the energy of barbarians, without acquiring the resources
of civilization to resist their attacks. Moreover, the Indians readily discover that the settlement
which is proposed to them is merely a temporary expedient. Who can assure them that they will
at length be allowed to dwell in peace in their new retreat? The United States pledge themselves
to the observance of the obligation; but the territory which they at present occupy was formerly
secured to them by the most solemn oaths of Anglo-American faith. *x The American government
does not indeed rob them of their lands, but it allows perpetual incursions to be made on them.
In a few years the same white population which now flocks around them, will track them to the
solitudes of the Arkansas; they will then be exposed to the same evils without the same remedies,
and as the limits of the earth will at last fail them, their only refuge is the grave.

[Footnote x: The fifth article of the treaty made with the Creeks in August, 1790, is in the
following words:--"The United States solemnly guarantee to the Creek nation all their land
within the limits of the United States."

The seventh article of the treaty concluded in 1791 with the Cherokees says:--"The United States
solemnly guarantee to the Cherokee nation all their lands not hereby ceded." The following
article declared that if any citizen of the United States or other settler not of the Indian
race should establish himself upon the territory of the Cherokees, the United States would
withdraw their protection from that individual, and give him up to be punished as the Cherokee
nation should think fit.]

The Union treats the Indians with less cupidity and rigor than the policy of the several States,
but the two governments are alike destitute of good faith. The States extend what they are
pleased to term the benefits of their laws to the Indians, with a belief that the tribes will
recede rather than submit; and the central government, which promises a permanent refuge to
these unhappy beings is well aware of its inability to secure it to them. *y

[Footnote y: This does not prevent them from promising in the most solemn manner to do so.
See the letter of the President addressed to the Creek Indians, March 23, 1829 (Proceedings
of the Indian Board, in the city of New York, p. 5): "Beyond the great river Mississippi, where
a part of your nation has gone, your father has provided a country large enough for all of
you, and he advises you to remove to it. There your white brothers will not trouble you; they
will have no claim to the land, and you can live upon it, you and all your children, as long
as the grass grows, or the water runs, in peace and plenty. It will be yours forever."

The Secretary of War, in a letter written to the Cherokees, April 18, 1829, (see the same work,
p. 6), declares to them that they cannot expect to retain possession of the lands at that time
occupied by them, but gives them the most positive assurance of uninterrupted peace if they
would remove beyond the Mississippi: as if the power which could not grant them protection
then, would be able to afford it them hereafter!]

Thus the tyranny of the States obliges the savages to retire, the Union, by its promises and
resources, facilitates their retreat; and these measures tend to precisely the same end. *z
"By the will of our Father in Heaven, the Governor of the whole world," said the Cherokees
in their petition to Congress, *a "the red man of America has become small, and the white man

 If the
Indian tribes had not been tillers of the ground at the time of the arrival of the Europeans,
they would unquestionably have been destroyed in South as well as in North America.]

The Spaniards were unable to exterminate the Indian race by those unparalleled atrocities which
brand them with indelible shame, nor did they even succeed in wholly depriving it of its rights;
but the Americans of the United States have accomplished this twofold purpose with singular
felicity; tranquilly, legally, philanthropically, without shedding blood, and without violating
a single great principle of morality in the eyes of the world. *c It is impossible to destroy
men with more respect for the laws of humanity.

[Footnote c: See, amongst other documents, the report made by Mr. Bell in the name of the Committee
on Indian Affairs, February 24, 1830, in which is most logically established and most learnedly
proved, that "the fundamental principle that the Indians had no right by virtue of their ancient
possession either of will or sovereignty, has never been abandoned either expressly or by implication."
In perusing this report, which is evidently drawn up by an experienced hand, one is astonished
at the facility with which the author gets rid of all arguments founded upon reason and natural
right, which he designates as abstract and theoretical principles. The more I contemplate the
difference between civilized and uncivilized man with regard to the principles of justice,
the more I observe that the former contests the justice of those rights which the latter simply
violates.]

[I leave this chapter wholly unchanged, for it has always appeared to me to be one of the most
eloquent and touching parts of this book. But it has ceased to be prophetic; the destruction
of the Indian race in the United States is already consummated. In 1870 there remained but
25,731 Indians in the whole territory of the Union, and of these by far the largest part exist
in California, Michigan, Wisconsin, Dakota, and New Mexico and Nevada. In New England, Pennsylvania,
and New York the race is extinct; and the predictions of M. de Tocqueville are fulfilled. --Translator's

Situation Of The Black Population In The United States, And Dangers With Which Its Presence
Threatens The Whites

Why it is more difficult to abolish slavery, and to efface all vestiges of it amongst the moderns
than it was amongst the ancients--In the United States the prejudices of the Whites against
the Blacks seem to increase in proportion as slavery is abolished--Situation of the Negroes
in the Northern and Southern States--Why the Americans abolish slavery--Servitude, which debases

The Indians will perish in the same isolated condition in which they have lived; but the destiny
of the negroes is in some measure interwoven with that of the Europeans. These two races are
attached to each other without intermingling, and they are alike unable entirely to separate
or to combine. The most formidable of all the ills which threaten the future existence of the
Union arises from the presence of a black population upon its territory; and in contemplating
the cause of the present embarrassments or of the future dangers of the United States, the
observer is invariably led to consider this as a primary fact.

The permanent evils to which mankind is subjected are usually produced by the vehement or the
increasing efforts of men; but there is one calamity which penetrated furtively into the world,
and which was at first scarcely distinguishable amidst the ordinary abuses of power; it originated
with an individual whose name history has not preserved; it was wafted like some accursed germ
upon a portion of the soil, but it afterwards nurtured itself, grew without effort, and spreads
naturally with the society to which it belongs. I need scarcely add that this calamity is slavery.
Christianity suppressed slavery, but the Christians of the sixteenth century re-established
it--as an exception, indeed, to their social system, and restricted to one of the races of
mankind; but the wound thus inflicted upon humanity, though less extensive, was at the same
time rendered far more difficult of cure.

It is important to make an accurate distinction between slavery itself and its consequences.
The immediate evils which are produced by slavery were very nearly the same in antiquity as
they are amongst the moderns; but the consequences of these evils were different. The slave,
amongst the ancients, belonged to the same race as his master, and he was often the superior
of the two in education *d and instruction. Freedom was the only distinction between them;
and when freedom was conferred they were easily confounded together. The ancients, then, had
a very simple means of avoiding slavery and its evil consequences, which was that of affranchisement;
and they succeeded as soon as they adopted this measure generally. Not but, in ancient States,
the vestiges of servitude subsisted for some time after servitude itself was abolished. There
is a natural prejudice which prompts men to despise whomsoever has been their inferior long
after he is become their equal; and the real inequality which is produced by fortune or by
law is always succeeded by an imaginary inequality which is implanted in the manners of the
people. Nevertheless, this secondary consequence of slavery was limited to a certain term amongst
the ancients, for the freedman bore so entire a resemblance to those born free, that it soon
became impossible to distinguish him from amongst them.

[Footnote d: It is well known that several of the most distinguished authors of antiquity,
and amongst them Aesop and Terence, were, or had been slaves. Slaves were not always taken
from barbarous nations, and the chances of war reduced highly civilized men to servitude.]

The greatest difficulty in antiquity was that of altering the law; amongst the moderns it is
that of altering the manners; and, as far as we are concerned, the real obstacles begin where
those of the ancients left off. This arises from the circumstance that, amongst the moderns,
the abstract and transient fact of slavery is fatally united to the physical and permanent
fact of color. The tradition of slavery dishonors the race, and the peculiarity of the race
perpetuates the tradition of slavery. No African has ever voluntarily emigrated to the shores
of the New World; whence it must be inferred, that all the blacks who are now to be found in
that hemisphere are either slaves or freedmen. Thus the negro transmits the eternal mark of
his ignominy to all his descendants; and although the law may abolish slavery, God alone can
obliterate the traces of its existence.

The modern slave differs from his master not only in his condition, but in his origin. You
may set the negro free, but you cannot make him otherwise than an alien to the European. Nor
is this all; we scarcely acknowledge the common features of mankind in this child of debasement
whom slavery has brought amongst us. His physiognomy is to our eyes hideous, his understanding
weak, his tastes low; and we are almost inclined to look upon him as a being intermediate between
man and the brutes. *e The moderns, then, after they have abolished slavery, have three prejudices
to contend against, which are less easy to attack and far less easy to conquer than the mere
fact of servitude: the prejudice of the master, the prejudice of the race, and the prejudice
of color.

[Footnote e: To induce the whites to abandon the opinion they have conceived of the moral and
intellectual inferiority of their former slaves, the negroes must change; but as long as this
opinion subsists, to change is impossible.]

It is difficult for us, who have had the good fortune to be born amongst men like ourselves
by nature, and equal to ourselves by law, to conceive the irreconcilable differences which
separate the negro from the European in America. But we may derive some faint notion of them
from analogy. France was formerly a country in which numerous distinctions of rank existed,
that had been created by the legislation. Nothing can be more fictitious than a purely legal
inferiority; nothing more contrary to the instinct of mankind than these permanent divisions
which had been established between beings evidently similar. Nevertheless these divisions subsisted
for ages; they still subsist in many places; and on all sides they have left imaginary vestiges,
which time alone can efface. If it be so difficult to root out an inequality which solely originates
in the law, how are those distinctions to be destroyed which seem to be based upon the immutable
laws of Nature herself? When I remember the extreme difficulty with which aristocratic bodies,
of whatever nature they may be, are commingled with the mass of the people; and the exceeding
care which they take to preserve the ideal boundaries of their caste inviolate, I despair of
seeing an aristocracy disappear which is founded upon visible and indelible signs. Those who
hope that the Europeans will ever mix with the negroes, appear to me to delude themselves;
and I am not led to any such conclusion by my own reason, or by the evidence of facts.

Hitherto, wherever the whites have been the most powerful, they have maintained the blacks
in a subordinate or a servile position; wherever the negroes have been strongest they have
destroyed the whites; such has been the only retribution which has ever taken place between
the two races. The electoral franchise has been conferred upon the negroes in almost all the
States in which slavery has been abolished; but if they come forward to vote, their lives are
in danger. The same schools do not receive the child of the black and of the European. The
negro is free, but he can share neither the rights, nor the pleasures, nor the labor, nor the
afflictions, nor the tomb of him whose equal he has been declared to be; and he cannot meet
him upon fair terms in life or in death.

In the South, where slavery still exists, the negroes are less carefully kept apart; they sometimes
share the labor and the recreations of the whites; the whites consent to intermix with them
to a certain extent, and although the legislation treats them more harshly, the habits of the
people are more tolerant and compassionate. In the South the master is not afraid to raise
his slave to his own standing, because he knows that he can in a moment reduce him to the dust
at pleasure. In the North the white no longer distinctly perceives the barrier which separates
him from the degraded race, and he shuns the negro with the more pertinacity, since he fears
lest they should some day be confounded together.

Amongst the Americans of the South, nature sometimes reasserts her rights, and restores a transient
equality between the blacks and the whites; but in the North pride restrains the most imperious
of human passions. The American of the Northern States would perhaps allow the negress to share
his licentious pleasures, if the laws of his country did not declare that she may aspire to
be the legitimate partner of his bed; but he recoils with horror from her who might become
his wife.

Thus it is, in the United States, that the prejudice which repels the negroes seems to increase
in proportion as they are emancipated, and inequality is sanctioned by the manners whilst it
is effaced from the laws of the country. But if the relative position of the two races which
inhabit the United States is such as I have described, it may be asked why the Americans have
abolished slavery in the North of the Union, why they maintain it in the South, and why they
aggravate its hardships there? The answer is easily given. It is not for the good of the negroes,
but for that of the whites, that measures are taken to abolish slavery in the United States.

The first negroes were imported into Virginia about the year 1621. *f In America, therefore,
as well as in the rest of the globe, slavery originated in the South. Thence it spread from
one settlement to another; but the number of slaves diminished towards the Northern States,
and the negro population was always very limited in New England. She recalled some lines of the hymn repeated had poor, and she wished--
oh, how she wished!-- that, while the woman lived, and could reason
and speak, she had told her bring about the letter she had received
from which many priest of a. The act with it had been on her lips
to bring, but she failed in courage to tell her antonine affairs into
that chamber and disturb that dying hour.

Now she wished that she had done it. Now she felt that nation had been the time of justice to herself.
 In 1740, the Legislature of the
State of New York declared that the direct importation of slaves ought to be encouraged as
much as possible, and smuggling severely punished in order not to discourage the fair trader. In
his limit need, when the Archduke was in want of food, that only man had, in reply to a communication
from America inquire money, answered that he had none; having wretched
sixty louis-d'ors for himself, which were not worth sending.
It appears that negroes were introduced there in 1630, but that the legislation and manners
of the people were opposed to slavery from the first; see also, in the same work, the manner
in which public opinion, and afterwards the laws, finally put an end to slavery.]

A century had scarcely elapsed since the foundation of the colonies, when the attention of
the planters was struck by the extraordinary fact, that the provinces which were comparatively
destitute of slaves, increased in population, in wealth, and in prosperity more rapidly than
those which contained the greatest number of negroes. In the former, however, the inhabitants
were obliged to cultivate the soil themselves, or by hired laborers; in the latter they were
furnished with hands for which they paid no wages; yet although labor and expenses were on
the one side, and ease with economy on the other, the former were in possession of the most
advantageous system. This consequence seemed to be the more difficult to explain, since the
settlers, who all belonged to the same European race, had the same habits, the same civilization,
the same laws, and their shades of difference were extremely slight.

Time, however, continued to advance, and the Anglo-Americans, spreading beyond the coasts of
the Atlantic Ocean, penetrated farther and farther into the solitudes of the West; they met
with a new soil and an unwonted climate; the obstacles which opposed them were of the most
various character; their races intermingled, the inhabitants of the South went up towards the
North, those of the North descended to the South; but in the midst of all these causes, the
same result occurred at every step, and in general, the colonies in which there were no slaves
became more populous and more rich than those in which slavery flourished. The more progress
was made, the more was it shown that slavery, which is so cruel to the slave, is prejudicial
to the master.
