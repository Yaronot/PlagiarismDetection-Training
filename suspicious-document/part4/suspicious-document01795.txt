The debate was opened by a speech from Mr. Mildmay, in which that gentleman at great length
and with much perspicuity explained his notion of that measure of Parliamentary Reform which
he thought to be necessary. He was listened to with the greatest attention to the close,--and
perhaps, at the end of his speech, with more attention than usual, as there had gone abroad
a rumour that the Prime Minister intended to declare that this would be the last effort of
his life in that course. But, if he ever intended to utter such a pledge, his heart misgave
him when the time came for uttering it. He merely said that as the management of the bill in
committee would be an affair of much labour, and probably spread over many nights, he would
be assisted in his work by his colleagues, and especially by his right honourable friend the
Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. It was then understood that Mr. Gresham would take
the lead should the bill go into committee;--but it was understood also that no resignation
of leadership had been made by Mr. Mildmay.

The measure now proposed to the House was very much the same as that which had been brought
forward in the last session. The existing theory of British representation was not to be changed,
but the actual practice was to be brought nearer to the ideal theory. The ideas of manhood
suffrage, and of electoral districts, were to be as for ever removed from the bulwarks of the
British Constitution. There were to be counties with agricultural constituencies, purposely
arranged to be purely agricultural, whenever the nature of the counties would admit of its
being so. No artificer at Reform, let him be Conservative or Liberal, can make Middlesex or
Lancashire agricultural; but Wiltshire and Suffolk were to be preserved inviolable to the plough,--and
the apples of Devonshire were still to have their sway. Every town in the three kingdoms with
a certain population was to have two members. But here there was much room for cavil,--as all
men knew would be the case. Who shall say what is a town, or where shall be its limits? Bits
of counties might be borrowed, so as to lessen the Conservatism of the county without endangering
the Liberalism of the borough. And then there were the boroughs with one member,--and then
the groups of little boroughs. In the discussion of any such arrangement how easy is the picking
of holes; how impossible the fabrication of a garment that shall be impervious to such picking!

Then Phineas was allowed to proceed and finish his story. "I don't see any way out of it; I
don't, indeed," said Laurence. By this time Phineas had come to think that the duel was in
very truth the best way out of the difficulty. It was a bad way out, but then it was a way;--and
he could not see any other. "As for ill treating him, that's nonsense," said Laurence. "What
are the girls to do, if one fellow mayn't come on as soon as another fellow is down? But then,
you see, a fellow never knows when he's down himself, and therefore he thinks that he's ill
used. I'll tell you what now. I shouldn't wonder if we couldn't do it on the sly,--unless one
of you is stupid enough to hit the other in an awkward place. If you are certain of your hand
now, the right shoulder is the best spot." Phineas felt very certain that he would not hit
Lord Chiltern in an awkward place, although he was by no means sure of his hand. Let come what
might, he would not aim at his adversary. But of this he had thought it proper to say nothing
to Laurence Fitzgibbon.

And the duel did come off on the sly. The meeting in the drawing-room in Portman Square, of
which mention was made in the last chapter, took place on a Wednesday afternoon. On the Thursday,
Friday, Monday, and Tuesday following, the great debate on Mr. Mildmay's bill was continued,
and at three on the Tuesday night the House divided. There was a majority in favour of the
Ministers, not large enough to permit them to claim a triumph for their party, or even an ovation
for themselves; but still sufficient to enable them to send their bill into committee. Mr.
Daubeny and Mr. Turnbull had again joined their forces together in opposition to the ministerial
measure. On the Thursday Phineas had shown himself in the House, but during the remainder of
this interesting period he was absent from his place, nor was he seen at the clubs, nor did
any man know of his whereabouts. Of lord, and the cognition of modern name in a young mho but sands
