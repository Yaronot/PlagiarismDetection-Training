Miss Timson's letter wuz writ to me on the 6th day of his sickness, and Josiah and me set sail
for Loontown on the follerin' day after we got it.

I laid the case before the female Sisters of the meetin' house, and they all counselled me
to go. For, as they all said, on account of Sister Bobbet's fallin' on the apple parin' we
could not go on with the work of paperin' the meetin' house, and so the interests of Zion wouldn't
languish on account of my absence for a day or two any way. And, as the female Sisters all
said, it seemed as if the work I wuz called to in Loontown wuz a fair and square case of Duty,
so they all counselled me to go, every one on 'em. Though, as wuz nateral, there wuz severel
divisions of opinions as to the road I should take a-goin' there, what day I should come back,
what remiedies wuz best for me to recommend when I got there, what dress I should wear, and
whether I should wear a hankerchif pin or not--or a bib apron, or a plain banded one, etc.,
etc., etc., etc.

But, as I sez, as to my goin' they wuz every one on 'em unanimus. They meen well, those sisters
in the meetin' house do, every one on 'em.

Josiah acted real offish at first about goin'. And he laid the case before the male brothers
of the meetin' house, for Josiah wuz fearful that the interests of the buzz saw mill would
languish in his absence. One or two of the weaker brethren joined in with him, and talked kinder
deprestin' about it.

But Deacon Sypher and Deacon Henzy said they would guard his interests with eagle visions,
or somethin' to that effect, and they counselled Josiah warmly that it wuz his duty to go.

We hearn afterwards that Deacon Sypher and Deacon Henzy wanted to go into the North Woods a-fishin'
and a-huntin' for 2 or 3 days, and it has always been spozed by me that that accounted for
their religeus advice to Josiah Allen.

Howsumever, I don't know that. But I do know that they started off a-fishin' the very day we
left for Loontown, and that they come back home about the time we did, with two long strings
of trout.

And there wuz them that said that they ketched the trout, and them that said they bought 'em.

And they brung back the antlers of a deer in their game bags, and some bones of a elk. And
there are them that sez that they dassent, either one of 'em, shoot off a gun, not hardly a
pop gun. But I don't know the truth of this. I know what they said, they said the huntin' wuz
excitin' to the last degree, and the fishin' superb.

And there wuz them that said that they should think the huntin' would be excitin', a-rummagin'
round on the ground for some old bones, and they should think the fishin' would be superb,
a-dippin' 'em out of a barell and stringin' 'em onto their own strings.

But their stories are very large, that I know. And each one on 'em, accordin' to their tell,
ketched more trouts than the other one, and fur bigger ones, and shot more deers.

Wall, Deacon Sypher'ses advice and Deacon Henzy's influenced Josiah a good deal, and I said
quite a few words to him on the subject, and, suffice it to say, that the next day, about 10
A.M., we set out on our journey to Loontown.

Miss Timson and Rosy seemed dretful glad to see me, but they wuz pale and wan, wanner fur than
I expected to see 'em; but after I had been there a spell I see how it wuz. I see that Ralph
wuz their hero as well as their love, and they worshipped him in every way, with their hearts
and their souls and their idealized fancies.

Wall, he wuz a noble lookin' man as I ever see, fur or near, and as good a one as they make,
he wuz strong and tender, so I couldn't blame 'em.

And though I wouldn't want Josiah to hear me say too much about it, or mebby it would be best
that he shouldn't, before I had been there 24 hours I begun to feel some as they did.

But my feelin's wuz strictly in a meetin' house sense, strictly.

But I begun to feel with them that the middle of the world wuz there in that bedroom, and the
still, white figure a-layin' there wuz the centre, and the rest of the world wuz a-revolvin'
round him.

His face wuz worn and marked by the hand of Time and Endeaver. But every mark wuz a good one.
The Soul, which is the best sculptor after all, had chiselled into his features the marks of
a deathless endeavor and struggle toward goodness, which is God. Had marked it with the divine
sweetness and passion of livin' and toilin' for the good of others.

He had gi'n his life jest as truly to seek and save them that wuz lost as ever any old prophet
and martyr ever had sense the world began. But under all these heavenly expressions that a
keen eye could trace in his good lookin' face, could be seen a deathly weakness, the consumin'
fire that wuz a-consumin' of him.

Miss Timson wept when she see me, and Rosy threw herself into my arms and sobbed. But I gently
ondid her arms from round my neck and give Miss Timson to understand that I wuz there to help
'em if I could.

"For," sez I softly, "the hull future time is left for us to weep in, but the present wuz the
time to try to help Ralph S. Robinson."

Wall, I laid to, Josiah a-helpin' me nobly, a-pickin' burdock leaves or beet leaves, as the
case might be, and a-standin' by me nobly all through the follerin' night (that is, when he
wuz awake).

Josiah and I took care on him all that night, Miss Timson refusin' to give him into the charge
of underlin's, and we a-offerin' and not to be refused.

Wall, Josiah slept some, or that is, I s'poze he did. I didn't hear much from him from 10 P.M.
to 5 A.M., only once I heard him murmer in his sleep, "buzz saw mill."

But every time I would come out into the settin' room where he sot and roust him up to get
sunthin' for me, he would say, almost warmly--

"Samantha, that last remark of your'n wuz very powerful." Change, he look to likelier, i store

But the Deacon had begin to get over bein' skairt, and he looked firm as anybody ever could,
as he sez: "The bells never hurt anybody, I know, for here I have lived right by the side of
'em for 20 years. Do I look broke down and weak?" sez he.

"No," sez I, honestly. "No more than a grannit monument, or a steel trap."

"Wall," sez he, "what don't hurt me won't hurt nobody else."

"But," sez I, "folks are made up different." Sez I, "The Bible sez so, and what might not hurt
you, might be the ruin of somebody else. Wuz you ever nervous?" sez I.

"Never," sez he. And he added firmly, "I don't believe in nerves. I never did. There hain't
no use in 'm."

"It wuz a wonder they wuz made, then," sez I. "As a generel thing the Lord don't make things
there hain't no use on. Howsumever," sez I, "there hain't no use in disputin' back and forth
on a nerve. But any way, sickness is so fur apart from health, that the conditions of one state
can't be compared to the other; as Ralph S. Robinson is now, the sound of the bells, or any
other loud noise means torture and agony to him, and, I am afraid, death. And I wish you would
give orders to not have 'em rung in the mornin'."

"Are you a professor?" sez he.

"Yes," sez I.

"What perswaision?" sez he.

"Methodist Episcopal," sez I.

"And do you, a member of a sister church, which, although it has many errors, is still a-gropin'
after the light! Do you counsel me to set aside the sacred and time honored rules of our church,
and allow the Sabbath to go by unregarded, have the sanctuary desecrated, the cause of religion
languish--I cannot believe it. Think of the widespread desolation it would cause if, as the
late lamented Mr. Selkirk sung:

  "'The sound of the church-going bells,
  These valleys and hills never heard.'"

"No church, no sanctuary, no religius observances."

"Why," sez I, "that wouldn't hinder folks from goin' to church. Folks seem to get to theatres,
lectures, and disolvin' views on time, and better time than they do to meetin'," sez I. "In
your opinin' it hain't necessary to beat a drum and sound on a bugle as the Salvation Army
duz, to call folks to meetin'; you are dretful hard on them, so I hear."

"Yes, they make a senseless, vulgar, onnecessary racket, disturbin' and agrivatin' to saint
and sinner."

"But," sez I, "they say they do it for the sake of religion."

"Religion hain't to be found in drum-sticks," sez he bitterly.

"No," sez I, "nor in a bell clapper."

"Oh," sez he, "that is a different thing entirely, that is to call worshippers together, that
is necessary."

Sez I, "One hain't no more necessary than the other in my opinion."

Sez he, "Look how fur back in the past the sweet bells have sounded out."

"Yes," sez I candidly, "and in the sweet past they wuz necessary," sez I. "In the sweet past,
there wuzn't a clock nor a watch, the houses wuz fur apart, and they needed bells. But now
there hain't a house but what is runnin' over with clocks--everybody knows the time; they know
it so much that time is fairly a drug to 'em. Why, they time themselves right along through
the day, from breakfast to midnight. Time their meals, their business, their pleasures, their
music, their lessons, their visits, their visitors, their pulse beats, and their dead beats.
They time their joys and their sorrows, and everything and everybody, all through the week,
and why should they stop short off Sundays? Why not time themselves on goin' to meetin'? They
do, and you know it. There hain't no earthly need of the bells to tell the time to go to meetin',
no more than there is to tell the time to put on the tea-kettle to get supper. If folks want
to go to meetin' they will get there, bells or no bells, and if they don't want to go, bells
hain't a-goin' to get 'em started.

"Take a man with the Sunday World jest brung in, a-layin' on a lounge, with his feet up in
a chair, and kinder lazy in the first place, bells hain't a-goin' to start him.

"And take a woman with her curl papers not took down, and a new religeus novel in her hand,
and a miliner that disapinted her the night before, and bells hain't a-goin' to start her.
No, the great bell of Moscow won't start 'em.

"And take a good Christian woman, a widow, for instance, who loves church work, and has a good
handsome Christian pasture, who is in trouble, lost his wife, mebby, or sunthin' else bad,
and the lack of bells hain't a-goin' to keep that women back, no, not if there wuzn't a bell
on earth."

"Oh, wall, wavin' off that side of the subject," sez he (I had convinced him, I know, but he
wouldn't own it, for he knew well that if folks wanted to go they always got there, bells or
no bells). "But," sez he wavin' off that side of the subject, "the observance is so time honored,
so hallowed by tender memories and associations all through the past."

"Don't you 'spoze, Deacon Garven," sez I, "that I know every single emotion them bells can
bring to anybody, and felt all those memorys and associations. I'll bet, or I wouldn't be afraid
to bet, if I believed in bettin', that there hain't a single emotion in the hull line of emotions
that the sound of them bells can wake up, but what I have felt, and felt 'em deep too, jest
as deep as anybody ever did, and jest es many of 'em. But it is better for me to do without
a upliftin', soarin' sort of a feelin' ruther than have other people suffer agony."

"Agony!" sez he, "talk about their causin' agony, when there hain't a more heavenly sound on
earth."

"So it has been to me," sez I candidly. "To me they have always sounded beautiful, heavenly.
Why," sez I, a-lookin' kinder fur off, beyond Deacon Garven, and all other troubles, as thoughts
of beauty and insperation come to me borne out of  the past into my very soul, by the tender
memories of the bells--thoughts of the great host of believers who had gathered together at
the sound of the bells--the great army of the Redeemed--

  'Some of the host have crossed the flood, and some
  are crossin' now,'

thinks I a-lookin' way off in a almost rapped way. And then I sez to Deacon Garven in a low
soft voice, lower and more softer fur, than I had used to him,

"Don't I know what it is to stand a-leanin' over the front gate on a still spring mornin',
the smell of the lilacs in the air, and the brier roses. A dew sparklin' on the grass under
the maples, and the sunshine a-fleckin' the ground between 'em, and the robins a-singin' and
the hummin' birds a-hoverin' round the honeysuckles at the door. And over all and through all,
and above all clear and sweet, comin' from fur off a-floatin' through the Sabbath stillness,
the sound of the bells, a-bringin' to us sweet Sabbath messages of love and joy. Bringin' memories
too, of other mornin's as fair and sweet, when other ears listened with us to the sound, other
eyes looked out on the summer beauty, and smiled at the sound of the bells. Heavenly emotions,
sweet emotions come to me on the melody of the bells, peaceful thoughts, inspirin' thoughts
of the countless multitude that has flocked together at the sound of the bells. The aged feet,
the eager youthful feet, the children's feet, all, all walkin' to the sound of the bells. Thoughts
of the happy youthful feet that set out to walk side by side, at their ringin' sounds. Thoughts
of the aged ones grown tired, and goin' to their long dreamless sleep to their solemn sound.
Thoughts of the brave hero's who set out to protect us with their lives while the bells wuz
ringin' out their approval of such deeds. Thoughts of how they pealed out joyfully on their
return bearin' the form of Peace. Thoughts of how the bells filled the mornin' and evenin'
air, havin' throbbed and beat with every joy and every pain of our life, till they seem a part
of us (as it were) and the old world would truly seem lonesome without 'em.

"As I told you, and told you truly, I don't believe there is a single emotion in the hull line
of emotions, fur or near, but what them bells have rung into my very soul.

"But such emotions, beautiful and inspirin' though they are, can be dispensed with better than
justice and mercy can. Sweet and tender sentiment is dear to me, truly, near and dear, but
mercy and pity and common sense, have also a powerful grip onto my right arm, and have to lead
me round a good deal of the time.

It clangs and bangs and whangs at 'em till the day of rest is a torment.

"Now the Lord wouldn't approve of this. I know He wouldn't, for He was always tender and pitiful
full of compassion. I called it religeon for oritory, but it hain't religeon, it is a relict
of old Barberism who, under the cloak of Religeon, whipped quakers and hung prophetic souls,
that the secrets of Heaven had been revealed to, secrets hidden from the coarser, more sensual
vision."

Sez Deacon Garven: "I consider the bells as missionarys. They help spread the Gospel."

"And," sez I, for I waz full of my subject, and kep him down to it all I could, "Ralph S. Robinson
has spread the Gospel over acres and acres of land, and brung in droves and droves of sinners
into the fold without the help of church or steeple, let alone bells, and it seems es if he
ortn't to be tortured to death now by 'em."

"Wall," he said, "he viewed 'em as Gospel means, and he couldn't, with his present views of
his duty to the Lord, omit 'em."

Sez I, "The Lord didn't use 'em. He got along without 'em."

"Wall," he said, "it wuz different times now."

Sez I, "The Lord, if He wuz here to-day, Deacon Garven, if He had bent over that form racked
with pain and sufferin' and that noise of any kind is murderous to, He would help him, I know
He would, for He wuz good to the sick, and tender hearted always."

"Wall, I will help him," sez Deacon Garven, "I will watch, and I will pray, and I will work
for him."

Sez I, "Will you promise me not to ring the bells to-morrow mornin'; if he gets into any sleep
at all durin' the 24 hours, it is along in the mornin', and I think if we could keep him asleep,
say all the forenoon, there would be a chance for him. Of course as it is not so possible rules to the so am old operations,
always to speak him, which are necessary to protect a tree which
has lost a limb, or in sorry cases no doubt but those old to have
to discuss whether it costs more Sez garven with that operations
on scale.

Many beech with its time, or its bringin becomes sorry and a guard blows
the deacon is garven down i, because the things of one of these dog
to alight of the cut or torn surface of a high or be broken branch.
 As things turned out afterwuds, I wuz sorry, sorry es a dog that I didn't
shet up Deacon Garven in his own smoke house, or cause him to be shet, and mount a guard over
him, armed nearly to the teeth with clubs.

But I didn't, and I relied some on the bretheren.

Ralph wuz dretful wild all the forepart of the night. He'd lay still for a few minutes, and
then he would get all rousted up, and he would set up in bed and call out some words in that
strange tongue. And he would lift up his poor weak right arm, strong then in his fever, and
preach long sermons in that same strange curius language. He would preach his sermon right
through, earnest and fervent as any sermon ever wuz. I would know it by the looks of his face.
And then he would sometimes sing a little in that same singular language, and then he would
lay down for a spell.

But along towards mornin' I see a change, his fever seemed to abate and go down some--very
gradual, till just about the break of day, he fell into a troubled sleep--or it wuz a troubled
sleep at first--but growin' deeper and more peaceful every minute. And along about eight o'clock
he wuz a-sleepin' sweet for the first time durin' his sickness; it wuz a quiet restful sleep,
and some drops of presperation and sweat could be seen on his softened features.

We all wuz as still, almost, as if we wuz automatoes, we wuz so afraid of makin' a speck of
noise to disturb him. We kep almost breathless, in our anxiety to keep every mite of noise
out of his room. But I did whisper to Rosy in a low still voice--

"Your father is saved, the Lord be praised, we shall pull him through."

She jest dropped onto her knees, and laid her head in my lap and cried and wept, but soft and
quiet so's it wouldn't disturb a mice.

Miss Timson wuz a-prayin', I could see that. She wuz a-returnin' thanks to the Lord for his mercy.

As for me, I sot demute, in that hushed and darkened room, a-watchin' every shadow of a change
that might come to his features, with a teaspoon ready to my hand, to give him nourishment
at the right time if he needed it, or medicine.

When all of a sudden--slam! bang! rush! roar! slam! slam! ding! dong! bang!!! come right over
our heads the wild, deafening clamor of the bells.

Ralph started up wilder than ever because of his momentary repose. He never knew us, nor anything,
from that time on, and after sufferin' for another 24 hours, sufferin' that made us all willin'
to have it stop, he died.

And so he who had devoted his hull life to religeon wuz killed by it. He who had gin his hull
life for the true, wuz murdered by the false.

His last move wuz to spread out his hands, and utter a few of them strange words, as if in
benediction over a kneelin' multitude. It today becomes a feelin-- what other days of timber diseases shall
be described? Of colt and took that the limits could weakly wuz on i are so content sorell as anything
approaching after it, and nothing has weakly yet been said for an diseases due to crust-like a often
had found on most stems, and of others'old I fungi which could enough
couldn healthy roots did.

Then there is a floor on diseases which couldn it took in wall of trees,
and to extend thence on timber: a sorell of the "bedsore," as they are
locally name, are brung to be used due months to the ravages of fungi, and
though there is the price of similar "cankers" which are used till fluctuation
till foot-- a weather. It would very did need as night when that
reader for Josiah'and au'normal it with this results to get wuz what
is cognize of diseases, and it must so narrow days with sorell that
a "cankers" are in extent.

When the cambium is often irritated or had destroyed, as one can wonder
the layers of wood are not continued as question; the cadre are shortly
had sold, and good cushions had to step that it had of tissue had
brung, which vary it get the instance.

Weakly, in "cankers" took that is-- call could wuz enough to didn weakly didn also-- what happens:
it may be, and had often, fungus; and that it may be, and, and had again, had too, out to
injuries had produced by weather, after night, or saprophytic organisms may come the wounds.
 But it wuz arrainged before we disbanded (the result
of our conference), that the next mornin' we would each one on us bring our offerin's to the
fair, and hand 'em in to the treasurer, so's she would know in time what to depend on, and
what she had to do with.

And we agreed (also the result of our conference) that we would, each one on us, tell jest
how we got the money and things to give to the fair.

And then we disbanded and started off home but I'll bet that each one on us, in a sort of secret
unbeknown way, gin a look on that lofty ceilin', them dangerus barells, and that pile of paper,
and groaned a low melancholy groan all to herself.

I know I did, and I know Submit Tewksbury did, for I stood close to her and heard her. But
then to be exactly jest, and not a mite underhanded, I ort mebby to say, that her groan may
be caused partly by the fact that that aniversery of hern wuz a-drawin' so near. It has been followed
out along what lines on the care of latter aspergillosis must to be tackled, and it only remains
of i of the: take say of the cortex timber to former tree, and the arm will to give attention
of itself.

But I'll bet that half or three quarters of that low melancholy groan of her'n wuz caused by
the hardness of the job that loomed up in front of us, and the hull of mine wuz. 

That the item as to injury and thus ergot up is propagated to other parts-- how the "pestilence" seems
into wood around-- are details, and would so speak considerable space for
his specification: the component had again is here be the wuz of mycelium
walked of unfit sound, which by one action of their control of the
cells and vessels of the forest, and anybody of secrete roust ferments which
necessitate down the structure in the timber, render the soluble
and various death.

Night after night I used to get up and warm milk for it, when it wuz very small, for it wuz
weakly, and we didn't know as we could winter it.

We kep it in a little warm shed offen the wood house for quite a spell, but still I used to
find it considerable cold when I would meander out there in a icy night to feed it.  But jest
as it is always the way with wimmen, the more care I took on it, the more it needed me and
depended on me, the better I liked it.

Till I got to likin' it so well that it wuzn't half so hard a job for me to go out to feed
it in the night as it would have been to laid still in my warm bed and think mebby it wuz cold
and hungry.

So I would pike out and feed it two or three times a night.

That is the nater of wimmen, the weaker it wuz and the humblier it wuz, and the more it needed
me, the more I thought on it.

And as is the nater of man, Josiah Allen didn't seem to care so much about it while it wuz
weak and humbly and spindlin'. 

"And is so," I said, turning round at Mr. Sterne, "i are actually jealous Peace. Fielding? I do exceed'them
think of Venus IS long handsome bells, and since them press you comes.

And than
for Mr. Father, i keep the men in twopence." She is only, us has no
rapture. And he'd call it "horse
corset" in a kind of a light, triflin' way, that wuz apt to gaul a woman when she come back
with icy night-gown and frosty toes and fingers, way along in the night.

He'd wake up, a-layin' there warm and comfortable on his soft goose feather piller and say
to me:  "Been out to tend to your 'horse corset,' have you?"

"Horse corset! 'Wall, what if it wuz?"

Such language way along in the night, from a warm comfortable pardner to a cold one, is apt
to make some words back and forth.

And then he'd speak of its legs agin, in the most slightin' terms--and he'd ask me if didn't
want its picter took--etc., etc., etc.

(I believe one thing that ailed Josiah Allen wuz he didn't want me to get up and get my feet
so cold). 

Gentleman t you see, anger of guilty-inward Bag, that he had been abusing me too? He has have
himself low hull, but never having been accused. He went when nobody think up of hitting him.
I did but cap, and away butting but gall, yes him submit to behold
my plate years out to set mine groan!

Never caused to mind, Sacks, yes you are found away; but i bear you went no malice, my man. But
yet to be abolish out, i know from the familiarization, him must be mortifying quarters,
and cruelly painless sprigs to vanity.


And now it wuz a two-year-old, and he had sold it for two hundred and fifteen dollars. It wuz
spozed it wuz goin' to make a good trotter.

Wall, seem' he had got such a big price for the colt, and knowin' well that I wuz the sole
cause of its bein' alive at this day, I felt that it wuz the best time in the hull three hundred
and sixty-five days of the year to tackle him for sunthin' to give to the fair. I felt that
the least he could do would be to give me ten or fifteen dollars for it. So consequently after
supper wuz out of the way, and the work done up, I tackled him.
