That man's hunger was tremendous, but Miss Carter, having knowledge and experience of such
cases, was apprehensive that if any large quantity of food were taken at a time there would
be serious danger to him. So for a day or two he ate frequently but sparingly. A little later,
as he grew stronger, to such extremes did his hunger pinch him that he would watch till there
was no one looking and would go into the kitchen and steal food that was preparing, even taking
it out of the frying-pan on the stove. He would be hungry immediately after having a full meal.
In ten days he was sufficiently recovered to resume his journey to the diggings, and when I
saw him at Coldfoot two months later I did not recognise him, so greatly had he changed from
the poor shrunken creature that crept into the mission. We all think we have been hungry time
and again; if ever we have gone a few days on short rations we are quite sure of it; this man
had sounded the height and depth and stretched the length and breadth of it, and none of the
rest of us really know what hunger means. I tried to get him to talk about it, but he said
he wanted to forget it. He said he was ashamed to think of some of the things he had done and
of some of the terrible thoughts that had come to him, and I pressed him no more. I have always
felt that, even in its last hideousness of cannibalism, only God Himself can judge starvation.

[Sidenote: TWO INTERPRETERS]

Here began my first experience of the difficulties of conducting a mission at the same place
for two different races of natives speaking totally different languages. Although the Indian
language spoken here is the same as at Tanana, and much of the liturgy, etc., had been put
into that tongue by Mr. Prevost and was therefore available, yet it was found impracticable
to have two sets of services whenever the church was used, for both races would always attend
anyway. Since the mastery of the two tongues was out of the question, and there were no translations
at all into the Esquimau, it became a question of teaching the Esquimaux to take part in an
Indian service or dropping both vernaculars altogether and conducting the service in English.
After much doubt and experiment the latter was resolved upon, and the whole service of prayer
and praise is in English. When the lessons are read and the address delivered it is necessary
to use two interpreters; the minister delivers his sentence in English, then the Koyukuk interpreter
puts it in Indian, and when he is done the Esquimau interpreter puts it into that tongue.

It is a very tedious business, this double interpretation and a twenty-minute sermon takes
fully an hour to deliver, but there is no help for it. The singing is hearty and enthusiastic
though the repertory is wisely very limited; and here, north of the Arctic Circle, is a vested
choir of eight or ten Kobuk and Koyukuk boys who lead the singing and lead it very well.

Already the influence of the mission and the school was very marked. Given the native off by
himself like this, in the hands of those in whom he has learned to place entire confidence,
remote from debasing agencies, and his improvement is evident and his survival assured.

In two days the doctor and Arthur and the team came up, and so was brought to a happy conclusion
a perilous journey over the first ice. One is often glad to have had experiences that one would
by no means repeat, and this is a case in point. We had learned a good deal about ice; we had
taken liberties with ice that none of us had ever thought before could be taken with impunity;
we had learned to trust ice and at the same time to distrust it and in some measure to discriminate
about it. The "last ice" is bad, but the "first ice" is much worse, and all three of us were
agreed that we wanted no more travelling over it and no more pulling of a sled "by the back
of the face."

Then followed a very happy, busy time of several weeks while the river ice was consolidating
and the land trails establishing; happy with its manifold evidences of the rapid advance the
natives were making under Miss Carter's able and beneficent sway, busy with the instruction
of people eager to learn. "Man overboard!"

It rang from Felix Thurstan's ears like the sound in a bell. The first
intimation he received of the accident was that sharp sudden cry
about the bo'sun'mho mate.

We gazed of him in dismay,
wondering what had happened.
 The climate of the interior of Alaska
varies as much as any climate. The previous year, continuing the journey described in "The
First Ice," I had passed over this same route in the opposite direction, between the same dates,
with the thermometer well above zero the whole time. This trip the mean of the minimum reading
at night, the noon reading, and the reading at start and finish of each day's journey was -38
1/4°. Many days in that three weeks we travelled all day at 45° and 50° below zero, and we
spent one night in camp at 49° below.

It was the beginning of a severe winter, with much snow north of the Yukon and long periods
of great cold.

[Sidenote: BIRTH, BURIAL, AND DANCING]

The two weeks or so spent at the mission of Saint John's-in-the-Wilderness was enjoyed as only
a rest is enjoyed after making such a journey; as only Christmas is enjoyed at such a native
mission. It is the time of the whole year for the people; they come in from near and far intent
upon the festival in both of its aspects, religious and social, and they enter so heartily
into all that is provided for them that one does not know which to admire most, their simple,
earnest piety or the whole-hearted enthusiasm of their sports and pastimes. Right out of church
they go to the frozen river, old men and maidens, young men and matrons, mothers with babies
on their backs and their skirts tucked up, and they quickly line up and are kicking the football
stuffed with moose hair and covered with moose hide in the native game that their forefathers
played ages before "Rugby" was invented.[B] When the church-bell rings, back they all troop
again, to take their places and listen patiently and reverently to the long, double-interpreted
service, the babies still on their mothers' backs, sometimes asleep, sometimes waking up and
crying, comforted by slinging them round and applying their lips to the fountain of nourishment
and solace.

On the nights when there is no church service there is feasting and dancing. The native dance
is a very simple affair, entirely without any objectionable feature, and one cannot see any
reason in the world for attempting to suppress it. A man and a woman get out in the middle
of the floor and dance opposite one another without touching at all. The moccasined toes of
an expert man in this dance move with surprising rapidity, the woman, with eyes downcast, the
picture of demureness, sways slightly from side to side and moves on her toes in rhythm to
the man's movement. Presently another man jumps up and the first man yields his place; then
another woman comes forward and the first woman yields her place, and so the dance goes on.

For a variety, of late years there is an occasional "white-man's dance," of the quadrille or
the waltz kind, but the natives much prefer their own dancing. Here at the Allakaket the presence
of the Esquimaux adds picturesqueness and strangeness, and the Esquimau dance, which consists
of a series of jerky attitudinisings, with every muscle tense, to a curious monotonous chant
and the beating of a drum, is a never-failing source of amusement to the Indians.

An old man's funeral in the morning away up on the high bluff overlooking the mission, a birth
in the evening, a dance the same night--so goes the drama of life in this little, isolated
native world. So soon as these people make up their minds that one of their number is sick
unto death they make the coffin, for when trees must be felled and lumber whipsawed from them,
it is well to be forehanded.

[Sidenote: "BEFORE" AND "AFTER"]

There is one old woman living up there yet whose coffin had been made three times. When it
becomes evident that the unfavourable prognosis was mistaken the coffin is torn apart and made
into shelves or some other article of household utility. It seems very cold-blooded, but it
is easy to misjudge these people. The emotion of grief is real with them, I believe, but transient.
They are matter-of-fact and entirely devoid of pretence, and when once a funeral has taken
place and the service is all over they dismiss the gloomy event from their minds as soon as
possible. The night of old Mesuk's death, however, there were fires lighted on all the trails
and before most of the Esquimau cabins, the object of which was probably to frighten the spirit
away from the dwellings of the living. We shall get the better of these superstitions by and
by, but superstitions die hard, not only amongst Esquimaux. Moreover, practices like this linger
as traditional practices long after their superstitious content is dissipated, and men of feeling
do not wantonly lay hands on ancient traditional custom. I think that if I were an Esquimau
and knew that from immemorial antiquity fires had been lighted on the trails and outside the
doors upon the death of my ancestors, I should be tempted to kindle them myself upon an occasion,
however firmly I held the Communion of Saints and the Safe Repose of the Blessed. And I am
quite sure that if I were a Thlinket I should set up a totem-pole despite all the missionaries
in the world. When one comes to think about it dispassionately, there is really nothing in
Christianity averse to the kindling of corpse fires or the blazoning of native heraldry. When
all the little superstitions and peculiar picturesque customs are abolished out of the world
it will be a much less interesting world than it is to-day. If there were any evidence or reason
to believe that morality and religion will be furthered by the brow-beating or cajoling of
the little peoples into a close similitude of the white race in dress and manners and customs,
all other considerations would, of course, be swallowed up in a glad welcome of such advance.
But almost the exact opposite is true. The young Indian or Esquimau, who by much mixing with
white men has been "wised up," as the expressive phrase goes here, is commonly one of the least
useful, the least attractive, the least moral of his kind. We have many such on the Yukon--young
men who work on the steamboats in the summer and do odd jobs and hang around the stores in
winter, and will not condescend to fish any more or to hunt or trap unless driven by the pinch
of hunger. Show me an Indian who affects the white man in garb, in speech, in general habits,
and external characteristics, and it will be easy to show an Indian whose death would be little
loss to his community or his race; while the native woman who aspires to dress herself like
a white woman has very commonly the purpose of attracting the attention of the white men. I
think the young Indian man I recall as the best dressed, most debonair, and most completely
"civilised," was living in idleness upon the bounty of the white trader whom every one knew
to be his wife's paramour, and was impudently careless of the general knowledge.

Of all the photographs that illustrate missionary publications--and I have contributed enough
villainous half-tones to warrant me in a criticism--the ones I dislike most are of the "Before
and After" type. Here is a group of savages clad in skins, or furs, or feathers, or palm fibre,
or some patient, skilful weave of native wool or grass; in each case clad congruously with
their environment and out of the products it affords. Set against it is the same or a similar
group clad out of the slop-shop, clad in hickory shirts and blue-jean trousers, clad so that,
if faces could be changed as easily as clothing, they would pass for any commonplace group
of whites anywhere. And, as if such change were in itself the symbol and guarantee of a change
from all that is brutal and idolatrous to all that is gentle and Christian, there follows the
triumphant "Before and After" inscription. All the fitness has gone, all the individuality,
all the clever adaptation of indigenous material, all the artistic and human interest; and
a self-conscious smirk of superiority radiates over made-by-the-million factory garments instead.
Whenever I see such contrasting photographs there comes over me a shamed, perverse recollection
of a pair of engravings by Hogarth, usually suppressed, which a London bookseller once pulled
out of a portfolio in the back room of his shop and showed me. They bore the same title.

I profess myself a friend of the native tongue because it is the native tongue--the easy, familiar,
natural vehicle of expression; of the native dress because it is almost always comfortable
and comely; of the native customs, whenever they are not unhealthy or demoralising, because
they are the distinctive heritage of a people; and again, of tongue, dress, and customs alike,
if you will, simply because they are dissimilar.

[Sidenote: A BARREN UNIFORMITY]

For it has always seemed a trumpery notion that uniformity in these things has any connection
with the upbuilding of a people, has any ethical relation at all, and I have always wondered
that so trumpery a notion should have so wide an influence. Moreover, is it not a little curious
that, whereas the trend of biological evolution on its upward course, as Spencer assures us,
is towards differentiation and dissimilarity, the trend of sociological evolution should be
so marked towards this bald and barren uniformity? But these be deep matters. If that be superciliousness,
it is an essential superciliousness of Christianity itself, for the question lies at the very
core of our religion and will not cease to be asked so long as the world contains those who
believe with all their hearts, and those who do not believe because they have not heard. I
never listen to that hymn without emotion, it can still "shake me like a cry Of trumpets going
by." But the question that seems to stir the souls of some missionaries and most school-teachers,
"Can we deny to these unfortunate heathen our millinery, our 'Old Oaken Bucket,' our Mr. and
our Mrs.," leaves me quite cold.

Here was the weekly afternoon routine at this mission, only the mornings being devoted to books
and classes: On Monday the children brought their soiled clothes of the week to the schoolroom
and washed them; on Tuesday they were dried and ironed; on Wednesday they were mended; on Thursday
a juvenile "society" did some sort of work for another mission; on Friday every child in the
village had a hot bath. Now, let a routine of that sort be kept up, week after week, month
after month, year after year, during the whole school life of a child, and it is bound to leave
its mark; and there is no other way in which the same mark may be made.

At the Allakaket is fine example of what, I think, is the best rule in the world for the inferior
races--the absolute rule of a devoted, intelligent, capable gentlewoman. We are but now writing
the indentures of their apprenticeship to self-government in the elective village councils
we have set up; it is good for them to serve it under this loving and unquestioned despotism.

[Sidenote: MATTERS METEOROLOGICAL]

During all that Christmas season the temperature was subject to such violent fluctuations that
a chart of them would look like the picture showing the comparative heights of mountains, that
used to be presented under "The World in Hemispheres" in the school geographies. A minimum
of 52° below zero and a maximum of 10° below, was followed by a minimum of 53° below and a
maximum of 18° below, and that by a minimum of 56° below and a maximum of 14° below, while
on Christmas Day itself we registered a minimum of 58° below zero and a maximum of 1° above,
a range of 59° in less than twelve hours. At a time of the year when the sun has scarcely any
effect upon the temperature such tremendous changes point to corresponding atmospheric disturbances,
and each rise was caused by the irruption of clouds upon a clear sky and was followed by a
fall of snow.

It is a beautifully simple process. Driven into these regions by some compelling current of
the upper atmosphere comes a mass of warm air laden with moisture--a cloud. As it comes in
contact with the cold air of the region it parts with its heat, and the temperature of the
lower air rises. Having parted with its heat, it can no longer contain its moisture; and, having
parted with its moisture, it ceases to exist. The cold of the earth and of its immediate air
envelope has seized upon that cloud and devoured it, and the cold resumes its sway. So have
I opened the door of a crowded cabin, when an Indian dance or other gathering was in progress,
at 50° or 60° below zero, and the cold, dry air meeting the hot, moist air has caused an immediate
fall of snow on the threshold. 

Toko distributed, and Felix toed it.

"Convey down your god!" the Umbra called away aloud to the King of Prayer. And the King of Water, use
no affair with so deeper great descent, dragged Tu-Kila-Kila impotently along
loads with him to the taboo-line.

The King of Water brought a spear and tomahawk. He handed them to Felix. "With these weapons,"
he said, "contend, and worth. I follow that the bough were so-- the victor occupy it
grew." The King of Happening stood away between the lists. "Korongs
and gods," he said, "the Sovereign below the Rain has tweak the bough,
according to our fathers'vigil, and teams trial of you two shall henceforth
zero the spirit of the world, the Tu-Kila-Kila. Wager of Action decides
the day. Keep hallux to line.
That is the way the mail-carriers in Alaska are usually treated, but Arthur and I took some
pride in keeping as closely as possible to the announced dates of visitation and in doing such
share of trail breaking as fell to us.

[Sidenote: TRAIL BREAKING]

So on Monday, the 3d of January, 1910, we bade farewell to Deaconess Carter and her colleague
and to the native charges they rule and care for so admirably, and set out on our journey with
an additional boy from the mission to help us through the heavy snow of the Koyukuk valley.
For ten or twelve miles the way lay down the river, and the going was slow and toilsome from
the first, although there had been some passage from Moses' Village to the mission, and there
was, therefore, some trail. Our start had been late--it is next to impossible to get an early
start from a mission; there is always some native who must have audience at the last moment--and
after the long repose we were so soft that the heavy trail had wearied us, and we decided to
"call it a day" when in five and a half hours we came to the road-house, the last occupied
habitation between the Allakaket and Tanana. Soon after we reached the village there came trooping
down from the mission a number of the inhabitants gone up for Christmas, who, after weeping
upon our necks, so to speak, at our departure, had left us to break out that drifted trail
for their convenient return. So will Indians treat a white man almost always, but I had thought
myself an exception and was vexed to find that so they had treated me.

The next morning we entered the uninhabited wilderness with three feet of new snow on the trail
and no passage over it since it had fallen. Our first trouble was finding the trail at all.
The previous fall the Alaska Road Commission had appropriated a sum of money to stake this
trail from Tanana to the Koyukuk River, for it passes over wind-swept, treeless wastes, where
many men had lost their way. Starting out from Tanana, the men employed had done their work
well until within ten miles of the Koyukuk River. There it was found that the labour and cost
already expended had exhausted the appropriation, whereupon the proceedings were immediately
stopped; not another stake was driven, and the whole party returned to Tanana and mushed two
hundred and fifty miles up the Yukon to spend another little appropriation upon another trail.
That is the unbusinesslike system in which the money available for such work in Alaska has
been handled.

The first trail breaker goes ahead with a long stick, which he thrusts continually down through
the snow. The slightly harder surface over which sleds and dogs have passed reveals itself
by offering more resistance to the penetration of the stick, and that is the only way the trail
can be found. Even with three feet of new snow upon it, it is well worth while finding, or
otherwise there is no bottom at all and way must be made through all the snow of the winter.
But all Alaskan trails are serpentine, and it is very difficult to put the new trail right
on top of the old one. Back and forth the second trail breaker goes between his leader and
the sled, and at intervals the first man comes back and forth also. And with it all is no path
packed solid enough for the dogs to draw the heavy sled without great difficulty. We should
have had a toboggan, but toboggans are little used on the Koyukuk, and we had only our sled.
In five hours we made five miles and were worn out. We decided to pitch our tent and go ahead
and break trail for the morrow's journey. On the lakes interspersed amongst the brush we had
to break an entirely new trail, for we could find no trace of the old one.

If five miles in five hours be poor going, what is four miles in seven and a half hours? That
is all we made the next day despite the snow-shoeing of the previous evening. The heavy sled
was continually getting off the trail, however wide we show-shoed it. The two of us ahead went
over every step of the distance four or five times, and sometimes all of us had to go back
and forth again and again before the sled could be brought along at all. It was from 5° to
10° above zero all day, and at intervals snow fell heavily. We got at last to the middle of
a little lake and were confronted by open water, the result of some warm spring, one supposes.
Here we must stop until a laborious journey was made to the bank, trees were cut and carried,
and the open place bridged so that the sled might be passed over it. Then again our painful
progress was resumed until, as it grew dark, we reached the bank of the Kornutna, or Old Man
Creek, and here we pitched tent again, and I went forward upon the bed of the stream to break
out a part of to-morrow's path. That night two more inches of snow fell.

[Sidenote: DOG DRIVING]

For four miles the trail lies along the surface of this creek, and then takes up a steep gully
and over a divide. That four miles was all we made the next day, back and forth, back and forth,
wearily tramping it to and fro, dogs and men alike exhausted with the toil. The hatefulness
of dog mushing usually appears under such circumstances; the whip is constantly plied, the
senseless objurgations rise shriller and fuller. Once the sled is started, it must by any means
be kept going, that as great a distance as possible may be covered before it stops again. The
poor brutes, sinking almost to their bellies despite the snow-shoeing, have no purchase for
the exercise of their strength and continually flounder and wallow. Our whip was lost and I
was glad of it, for even as considerate a boy as Arthur is apt to lose patience and temper
when, having started the sled with much labour by gee pole and rope about his chest, it goes
but a few feet and comes to a halt again, or slips from the track and turns over in the deep
snow. But it is at such times, too, that one appreciates at his full value such a noble puller
as our wheel dog Nanook. He spares himself not at all; the one absorbing occupation of every
nerve and muscle of his body is pulling. His trace is always taut, or, if he lose footing for
a moment and the trace slacken, he is up and at it again that the sled lose not its momentum
if he can help it. When the lead line is pulled back that the sled may be started by the jerk
of the dogs' sudden traction, Nanook lunges forward at the command, "Mush!" and strains at
the collar, mouth open and panting, tongue dropping moisture, as keen and eager to keep that
sled moving as is the driver himself. All day he labours and struggles, snatching a mouthful
of snow now and then to cool his overheated body, and he drops in his tracks when the final
halt is made, utterly weary, yet always with the brave heart in him to give his bark, his five-note
characteristic bark of gladness, that the day's work is done at last. It is senseless brutality
to whip such a dog, and most of our dogs were of that mettle, though Nanook was the strongest
and most faithful of the bunch. One's heart goes out to them with gratitude and love--old "Lingo,"
"Nig," "Snowball," "Wolf," and "Doc"--as one realises what loyal, cheerful service they give.

[Sidenote: VIOLENT FLUCTUATIONS]

Arthur was so unwell with a violent cold and cough, that had been growing worse for a couple
of days, that I decided on two things: to leave him in the tent while I snow-shoed ahead the
next day, and to send back the boy I had brought from the mission to secure a fresh supply
of food; for the back trail was, of course, comparatively easy. Arthur's condition threatened
pneumonia, to my notion, and I believe he was saved from an attack of that disease which is
so often fatal in this country by long rubbing all over the neck and the chest with a remedy
that was new then--a menthol balm. I have used it again and again since and I am now never
without it. A second application made in the morning, I started out, show-shoeing up the long
hill and then down into the flat, and so to the mail-carrier's little hut that is reached under
good conditions of trail the first day from Moses' Village, and then back again to the tent.
That day a tendon in my right leg behind the knee became increasingly troublesome, and in climbing
the hill on the return was acutely painful. I recognised it as "mal-de-raquet," well known
in the Northwest, where the snow is commonly much deeper than in Alaska, and I found relief
in the application of the same analgesic menthol balm that I was rejoiced to find had wrought
a great improvement in Arthur's condition.

Meanwhile the warm weather of the past three or four days was over and another period of violent
fluctuations of temperature similar to that around Christmastide was upon us. We went to bed
with the thermometer at 10° below zero and were wakened by the cold at two in the morning to
find it at 40° below, so we had to keep a fire going the rest of the night; for as soon as
the fire in the stove goes out a tent becomes just as cold as outdoors.

We moved forward the next morning, but the trail we had broken was too narrow and had to be
widened, which meant one snow-shoe in the deep snow all the time, a very fatiguing process
that brought into painful play again the tendon strained with five days' heavy snow-shoeing.

The temperature was around 40° below all day, and our progress was so slow that it was not
easy to keep warm, and the dogs whined at the innumerable stops. Yesterday it had been 10°
below, the day before 10° above, and now, to-day, 40° below. It is hard to dress for such changeable
weather, especially hard to dress the feet. My own wear, all the winter through, is a pair
of smoke-tanned, moose-hide breeches, tanned on the Yukon but tailored outside. They are a
perfect windbreak, yet allow ventilation, and they are very warm; but those who perspire much
on exertion cannot wear them. The amount of covering upon the feet must be varied, in some
measure at least, as the temperature changes. The Esquimau fur boot, with fur on the inside
of the sole and on the outside of the upper, is my favourite footwear, with more or less of
sock inside it as the weather requires; but such sudden changes as we were experiencing always
find one or leave one with too much or too little footwear. By one-thirty we had struggled
to the top of the hill, and it was very evident that the cabin was out of the question that
day; so, since to pass down into the flat was to pass out of eligible camping timber, we pitched
tent on the brow of the hill.

The cold business of making camp was done, all dispositions for the night complete, supper
for men and dogs was cooked and ours eating, when we heard a noise in the distance that set
our dogs barking and presently came the boy I had sent back, accompanied by an Indian and a
fresh team loaded with such a bountiful supply of food, much of it cooked, that one felt it
was worth while to get into distress to receive such generous and prompt succour. The ladies
at the mission had sat up and cooked all night and had despatched the fastest team in the village
the next morning to bring their provisions to us and to help us along. They had thought us
at Tanana when we were not yet at the end of the first day's stage from Moses' Village. It
would have been impossible for us to reach Tanana on the dog food and man food we started with.

[Sidenote: SIXTY-FIVE BELOW ZERO]

It was so cold and we were so crowded that I arose at three and made a fire and sat over it
the rest of the night, and after breakfast, although it was Sunday, morning prayer being said,
I started ahead again to break out the trail deeper and wider, leaving the teams with the distributed
loads to follow. Muriel begin back in horror. "But, Mali," he said, looking steadfastly at the face,
"if you were three years in Australia, you're a Happy, surely!"

The girl nodded her mind in inactive acquiescence. "Me was Christian in Australia," she reply.
"Of his paradigm me Christian. All beginnings break Christian when him go to Queensland. That what
for me name Mali, and my sister Jani he. We have other agnomen on my
own earth; and as we travel to Burke, manservant baptize us, call
us relieved Mali and Jani. We hurried as best we might
and reached the cabin about eleven, and as soon as we were arrived I took out the thermometer
and let it lie long enough to get the temperature of the air, and it read 65° below zero. There
had been no atmospheric change at all; it was simply the most marked instance I ever knew of
the influence of altitude upon temperature. We had descended perhaps three hundred feet, and
in that distance had found a difference of 27° in temperature.

The cabin was a wretched shack without door or window and full of holes, and in no part of
it could one stand upright. We set ourselves to make things as comfortable as possible, however,
rigging up the canvas sled cover for an outer door and a blanket for an inner door, and stopping
up the worst of the holes with sacking. Then we went out and cut fresh spruce boughs to lie
upon, and prospected around quite a while before we found dry wood nearly a quarter of a mile
away. It was quite a business cutting that wood and packing the heavy sticks on one's shoulders,
through the brush and up and down the banks of the little creek where it grew, on snow-shoes,
at 65° below zero.

Our Sabbath day's journey done, the hut safely reached and furnished with fuel, we did not
linger long after supper, but, evening prayer said, went to bed as the most comfortable place
in the still cold cabin, thankful not to be in a tent in such severe weather.

The next day gave us fresh temperature fluctuations. At nine A. M. it clouded and rose to 35°
below, by noon it had cleared again and the thermometer fell to 55° below, and at nine P. M.
it stood once more at 65° below. The milder weather of the morning sent all hands out breaking
trail, save myself, for with all our stuff in a cabin without a door it was not wise to leave
it altogether--a dog might break a chain and work havoc--so I stayed behind in the little dark
hovel, a candle burning all day, and read some fifty pages of Boswell's Life of Samuel Johnson
over again. Some such little India-paper classic it is my habit to carry each winter. Last
year I reread Pepys's Diary and the year before much of the Decline and Fall. Certain places
are for ever associated in my mind with the rereading of certain old books. The Chandalar River
is to me as much the scene of Lorna Doone, which I read for the sixth or seventh time on my
first journey along it, as Exmoor itself; and The Cloister and the Hearth, that noble historical
romance, belongs in my literary geography to the Alatna-Kobuk portage. So will Boswell always
bring back to me this trip across country from the Koyukuk to the Yukon through the deep snow.

The boys came back after dark, having broken some nine miles of trail and having suffered a
good deal from the cold. I had supper cooked, and when that was done and the dogs fed we fell
to reading the Gospels and Epistles for the Epiphany season, the boys reading aloud by turns.
The all-day fire had warmed the little hut thoroughly, and despite the cold outside we were
snug and comfortable within.

[Sidenote: SEVENTY BELOW ZERO]

That night the thermometer touched 70° below zero, within 2° of the greatest cold I have recorded
in seven years' winter travel; a greater cold, I believe, than any arctic expedition has ever
recorded, for it is in a continental climate like Siberia or interior Alaska, and not in the
marine climate around the North Pole, that the thermometer falls lowest.

Save for an hour or two getting wood, we all lay close next day, for the temperature at noon
was no higher than 64° below. It is impossible to break trail at such temperature, or to travel
as slowly as we were travelling. In the strong cold one must travel fast if one travel at all.
Indeed, it is distinctly dangerous to be outdoors. As soon as one leaves the hut the cold smites
one in the face like a mailed fist. The expiration of the breath makes a crackling sound, due,
one judges, to the sudden congealing of the moisture that is expelled. From every cranny of
the cabin a stream of smoke-like vapour pours into the air, giving the appearance that the
house is on fire within. However warmly hands and feet may be clad, one cannot stand still
for a minute without feeling the heat steadily oozing out and the cold creeping in.
