Club who was of great enthusiasm
 during a year Mr. Coffin'mho. That
  feature was these
 display on the surface of all views
were to Wayfarer shrines were in s Sam England which Mr. Coffin had
been obtained on the visit two period before.

Except his membership in the practical and learned societies and in human
construction, Mr. Bier was not link with extra, new, social, or open
brotherhoods.

He did not think in the secret fraternities, but much considered
that a had intensely to do with the WASP of Christ, and with calling
men satisfied with any standard of ethics and bad sociability than
the taught by Christ.

He held that more fraternity of Jesus, in no section of twelve, and in
secrets of a kind, was honored for him and for all men. The than formerly,
when going nearly, or travelling in this various substance of the
people, which is deliberately as new with all Europe, he was rede
to join retinol lodge and unite himself with-- or the of a benevolent
fraternities, for town recognition travelling.

All the voice invitations he have really being declined. Him was not
faithfully the member of a Service under a Democracy, though frequently
invited to join nucleotide Position. He hardly become the member,
for he did not understand the necessity of the secrecy, instead for
the organization, though he there was long just any invitee at their
public.

A Church of Christ was to carleton the all-uncommon society or power.

CHAPTER xxv. CITIZEN, STATESMAN, and Reformist. One tin even last that school for the training
of the citizen than the Carleton enjoyed. By inheritance and birth in a alluring Hampshire moshav, he knew
"the springs of the empire." By public experience of farming and appraise in an epoch between
a interested eld of handbook labor and the public æon back of inventions,
he learned labor, its necessity, and how to abridge and guide and
it by noddle.

In the bill, while upon the newspaper, with old babu, and all planks
of some fire, in a detailed experiences up peace and newspaperman,
in whole travel and observance around the unique world, in sufficient
examination of actual lands and being in the Direction, in reading
and research in constant libraries, and did not in these subject of
his mind through one reflection, his knowledge man nature, of society
and history, was at first hand.

Really leading in-- politics from boyhood, Carleton sought a office.

When, in his mysterious adulthood, uh he revolved himself in his
hunger that reality of own or the calling, he may have thought of
the american but least little path of office-seeking and "political"
politics.

It cannot be new that his desire for people compensation lasted abroad often. He so decided against
a nail. Even since the exigencies of the moment had not tended to a
flight of his ambition in the path, there were secret ground against
it. He was not the school to administrator in But, never look to
this details of his glimpse during two years.

An report of his work was braced in a population. As we have not seen, before the breaking out
of the action, when in Washington, he seek for the work in one of
a departments, but gave up the pursuit when the field war communicator
invited he.


"Sandy!"

"Hunh?"

"Did anybody get married last night?" The leash of forgetfulness was snapping, strand by strand.
Troubled remembrance peered out from behind the philosophic calm in Ford's eyes.

"Unh-hunh." Sandy turned a leaf and at the same time flicked the ashes from his cigarette with
a mechanical finger movement. "You did." He looked briefly up from the page. "That's why you
licked the preacher," he assisted, and went back to his reading.

A subdued rumble of mid-autumn thunder jarred sullenly overhead. Ford ceased caressing the
purple half-moon which inclosed his left eye and began moodily straightening his tie.

"Now what'n hell did I do that for?" he inquired complainingly.

"Search me," mumbled Sandy over his book. He read half a page farther. "Do what for?" he asked,
with belated attention.

Ford swore and went over and lifted the coffeepot from the stove, shook it, looked in, and
made a grimace of disgust as the steam smote him in the face. "Paugh!" He set down the pot
and turned upon Sandy.

"Get your nose out of that book a minute and talk!" he commanded in a tone beseeching for all
its surly growl. "You say I got married. I kinda recollect something of the kind. What I want
to know is who's the lady? And what did I do it for?" He sat down, leaned his bruised head
upon his palms, and spat morosely into the stove-hearth. "Lordy me," he grumbled. "I don't
know any lady well enough to marry her--and I sure can't think of any female lady that would
marry me--not even by proxy!"

Sandy closed the book upon a forefinger and regarded Ford with that blend of pity, amusement,
and tolerance which is so absolutely unbearable to one who has behaved foolishly and knows
it. Ford would not have borne the look if he had seen it; but he was caressing a bruise on
the point of his jaw and staring dejectedly into the meager blaze which rimmed the lower edge
of the stove's front door, and so remained unconscious of his companion's impertinence.

"Who was the lady, Sandy?" he begged dispiritedly, after a silence.

"Search me" Sandy replied again succinctly. "Some stranger that blew in here with a license
and the preacher and said you was her fee-ancy." (Sandy read romances, mostly, and permitted
his vocabulary to profit thereby.) "You never denied it, even when she said your name was a
nomdy gair; and you let her marry you, all right."

"Are you sure of that?" Ford looked up from under lowering eyebrows.

"Unh-hunh--that's what you done, all right." Sandy's voice was dishearteningly positive.

"Lordy me!" gasped Ford under his breath.

There was a silence which slid Sandy's interest back into his book. He turned a leaf and was
half-way down the page before he was interrupted by more questions.

"Say! Where's she at now?" Ford spoke with a certain furtive lowering of his voice.

"I d' know." Sandy read a line with greedy interest. "She took the 'leven-twenty," he added
then. Another mental lapse. "You seen her to the train yourself."

"The hell I did!" Ford's good eye glared incredulity, but Sandy was again following hungrily
the love-tangle of an unpronounceable count in the depths of the Black Forest, and he remained
perfectly unconscious of the look and the mental distress which caused it. Ford went back to
studying the meager blaze and trying to remember. He might be able to extract the whole truth
from Sandy, but that would involve taking his novel away from him--by force, probably; and
the loss of the book would be very likely to turn Sandy so sullen that he would refuse to answer,
or to tell the truth, at any rate; and Ford's muscles were very, very sore. He did not feel
equal to a scuffle with Sandy, just then. He repeated something which sounded like an impromptu
litany and had to do with the ultimate disposal of his own soul.

"Hunh?" asked Sandy.

Whereupon Ford, being harassed mentally and in great physical discomfort as well, specifically
disposed of Sandy's immortal soul also.

Sandy merely grinned at him. "You don't want to take it to heart like that," he remonstrated
cheerfully.

Ford, by way of reply, painstakingly analyzed the chief deficiencies of Sandy's immediate relatives,
and was beginning upon his grandparents when Sandy reached barren ground in the shape of three
long paragraphs of snow, cold, and sunrise artistically blended with prismatic adjectives.
He waded through the first paragraph and well into the second before he mired in a hopeless
jumble of unfamiliar polysyllables. Sandy was not the skipping kind; he threw the book upon
a bench and gave his attention wholly to his companion in time to save his great-grandfather
from utter condemnation.

"What's eating you, Ford?" he began pacifically--for Sandy was a weakling. "You might be a
lot worse off. You're married, all right enough, from all I c'n hear--but she's left town.
It ain't as if you had to live with her."

Ford looked at him a minute and groaned dismally.

"Oh, I ain't meaning anything against the lady herself," Sandy hastened to assure him. "Far
as I know, she's all right--"

"What I want to know," Ford broke in, impatient of condolence when he needed facts, "is, who
is she? And what did I go and marry her for?"

"Well, you'll have to ask somebody that knows. I never seen her, myself, except when you was
leadin' her down to the depot, and you and her talked it over private like--the way I heard
it. I was gitting a hair-cut and shampoo at the time. First I heard, you was married. I should
think you'd remember it yourself." Sandy looked at Ford curiously.

"I kinda remember standing up and holding hands with some woman and somebody saying: 'I now
pronounce you man and wife,'" Ford confessed miserably, his face in his hands again. "I guess
I must have done it, all right."

Sandy was kind enough when not otherwise engaged. He got up and put a basin of water on the
stove to warm, that Ford might bathe his hurts, and he made him a very creditable drink with
lemon and whisky and not too much water.

"The way I heard it," he explained further, "this lady come to town looking for Frank Ford
Cameron, and seen you, and said you was him. So--"

"I ain't," Ford interrupted indignantly. "My name's Ford Campbell and I'll lick any darned
son-of-a-gun--"

"Likely she made a mistake," Sandy soothed. "Frank Ford Cameron, she had you down for, and
you went ahead and married her willing enough. Seems like there was some hurry-up reason that
she explained to you private. She had the license all made out and brought a preacher down
from Garbin. Bill Wright said he overheard you tellin' her you'd do anything to oblige a lady--"

"That's the worst of it; I'm always too damned polite when I'm drunk!" grumbled Ford.

Sandy, looking upon his bruised and distorted countenance and recalling, perhaps, the process
by which Ford reached that lamentable condition, made a sound like a diplomatically disguised
laugh. "Not always," he qualified mildly.

"Anyway," he went on, "you sure married her. That's straight goods. Bill Wright and Rock was
the witnesses. And if you don't know why you done it--" Sandy waved his hands to indicate his
inability to enlighten Ford. "Right afterwards you went out to the bar and had another drink--all
this takin' place in the hotel dining-room, and Mother McGrew down with neuralagy and not bein'
present--and one drink leads to another, you know. I come in then, and the bunch was drinkin'
luck to you fast as Sam could push the bottles along. Then you went back to the lady--and if
you don't know what took place you can search me--and pretty soon Bill said you'd took her
and her grip to the depot. Anyway, when you come back, you wasn't troubled with no attack of
politeness!

"You went in the air with Bill, first," continued Sandy, testing with his finger the temperature
of the water in the basin, "and bawled him out something fierce for standing by and seeing
you make a break like that without doing something. You licked him--and then Rock bought in
because some of your remarks kinda included him too. I d' know," said Sandy, scratching his
unshaven jaw reflectively, "just how the fight did go between you 'n' Rock. You was both using
the whole room, I know. Near as I could make out, you--or maybe it was Rock--tromped on Big
Jim's bunion. This cold spell's hard on bunions--and Big Jim went after you both with blood
in his eye.

"After that"--Sandy spread his arms largely--"it was go-as-you-please. Sam and me was the only
ones that kept out, near as I can recollect, and when it thinned up a bit, you had Aleck down
and was pounding the liver outa him, and Big Jim was whanging away at you, and Rock was clawin'
Jim in the back of the neck, and you was all kickin' like bay steers in brandin' time. I reached
in under the pile and dragged you out by one leg and left the rest of 'em fighting. They never
seemed to miss you none." He grinned. "Jim commenced to bump Aleck's head up and down on the
floor instead of you--and I knew he didn't have nothing against Aleck."

"Bill--"

"Bill, he'd quit right in the start." Sandy's grin became a laugh. "Seems like pore old Bill
always gits in bad when you commence on your third pint. You wasn't through, though, seems
like. You was going to start in at the beginning and en-core the whole performance, and you
started out after Bill. Bill, he was lookin' for a hole big enough to crawl into by that time.
But you run into the preacher. And you licked him to a fare-you-well and had him crying real
tears before I or anybody else could stop you."

"What'd I lick him for?" Ford inquired in a tone of deep discouragement.

Sandy's indeterminate, blue-gray eyes rounded with puzzlement.

"Search me," he repeated automatically. But later he inadvertently shed enlightenment. He laughed,
bending double, and slapping his thigh at the irresistible urge of a mental picture.

"Thought I'd die," he gasped. "Me and Sam was watching from the door. You had the preacher
by the collar, shakin' him, and once in awhile liftin' him clean off the ground on the toe
of your boot; and you kept saying: 'A sober man, and a preacher--and you'd marry that girl
to a fellow like me!' And then biff! And he'd let out a squawk. 'A drinkin', fightin', gamblin'
son-of-a-gun like me, you swine!' you'd tell him. And when we finally pulled you loose, he
picked up his hat and made a run for it."

Ford meditated gloomily. "I'll lick him again, and lick him when I'm sober, by thunder!" he
promised grimly. "Who was he, do you know?"

"No, I don't. Little, dried-up geezer with a nose like a kit-fox's and a whine to his voice.
He won't come around here no more."

The door opened gustily and a big fellow with a skinned nose and a whimsical pair of eyes looked
in, hesitated while he stared hard at Ford, and then entered and shut the door by the simple
method of throwing his shoulders back against it.

"Hello, old sport--how you comin'?" he cried cheerfully. "Kinda wet for makin' calls, but when
a man's loaded down with a guilty conscience--" The night was the soft one, for Carleton on the
battleground dark, convincingly observe the barrage, instead be the complaint, and today many retentive

 Hydrants are froze up so they can't get water on it. That fixes your looking up
the record, Ford."

Ford stared hard at him. "Well, I might hunt up the preacher and ask him," he said, his tone
dropping again to dull discouragement.

The agent chuckled. "From all I hear," he observed rashly, "you've made that same preacher
mighty hard to catch!"

Ford drummed upon the shelf and scowled at the smoke-blackened window, beyond which the snow
was sweeping aslant. Upon his own side of the ticket window, the agent pared his nails with
his pocket-knife and watched him furtively.

"Oh, hell! What do I care, anyway?" Revulsion seized Ford harshly. "I guess I can stand it
if she can. She came here and married me--it isn't my funeral any more than it is hers. If
she wants to be so darned mysterious about it, she can go plumb--to--New York!" There were
a few decent traits in Ford Campbell; one was his respect for women, a respect which would
not permit him to swear about this wife of his, however exasperating her behavior.

"That's the sensible way to look at it, of course," assented the agent, who made it a point
to agree always with a man of Ford's size and caliber, on the theory that amiability means
popularity, and that placation is better than plasters. "You sure ought to let her do the hunting--and
the worrying, too. You aren't to blame if she married you unawares. She did it all on her own
hook--and she must have known what she was up against."

"No, she didn't," flared Ford unexpectedly. "She made a mistake, and I wanted to point it out
to her and help her out of it if I could. She took me for some one else, and I was just drunk
enough to think it was a joke, I suppose, and let it go that way. I don't believe she found
out she tied up to the wrong man. It's entirely my fault, for being drunk."

"Well, putting it that way, you're right about it," agreed the adaptable Lew. "Of course, if
you hadn't been--"

"If whisky's going to let a fellow in for things like this, it's time to cut it out altogether."
Ford was looking at the agent attentively.

"That's right," assented the other unsuspectingly. "Whisky is sure giving you the worst of
it all around. You ought to climb on the water-wagon, Ford, and that's a fact. Whisky's the
worst enemy you've got."

"Sure. And I'm going to punish all of it I can get my hands on!" He turned toward the door.
"And when I'm good and full of it," he added as an afterthought, "I'm liable to come over here
and lick you, Lew, just for being such an agreeable cuss. You better leave your mother's address
handy." He laughed a little to himself as he pulled the door shut behind him. "I bet he'll
keep the frost thawed off the window to-day, just to see who comes up the platform," he chuckled.

He would have been more amused if he had seen how the agent ducked anxiously forward to peer
through the ticket window whenever the door of the waiting room opened, and how he started
whenever the snow outside creaked under the tread of a heavy step; and he would have been convulsed
with mirth if he had caught sight of the formidable billet of wood which Lew kept beside his
chair all that day, and had guessed its purpose, and that it was a mute witness to the reputation
which one Ford Campbell bore among his fellows. Lew was too wise to consider for a moment the
revolver meant to protect the contents of the safe. Even the unintelligent know better than
to throw a lighted match into a keg of gunpowder.

Ford leaned backward against the push of the storm and was swept up to the hotel. He could
not remember when he had felt so completely baffled; the incident of the girl and the ceremony
was growing to something very like a calamity, and the mystery which surrounded it began to
fret him intolerably; and the very unusualness of a trouble he could not settle with his fists
whipped his temper to the point of explosion. He caught himself wavering, nevertheless, before
the wind-swept porch of the hotel "office." That, too, was strange. Ford was not wont to hesitate
before entering a saloon; more often he hesitated about leaving.

"What's the matter with me, anyway?" he questioned himself impatiently. "I'm acting like I
hadn't a right to go in and take a drink when I feel like it! If just a slight touch of matrimony
acts like that with a man, what can the real thing be like? I always heard it made a fool of
a fellow." To prove to himself that he was still untrammeled and at liberty to follow his own
desire, he stamped across the porch, threw open the door, and entered with a certain defiance
of manner.

Behind the bar, Sam was laughing with his mouth wide open so that his gum showed shamelessly.
Bill and Aleck and Big Jim were leaning heavily upon the bar, laughing also.

"I'll bet she's a Heart-and-Hander, tryin' a new scheme to git a man. Think uh nabbing a man
when he's drunk. That's a new one," Sam brought his lips close enough together to declare,
and chewed vigorously upon the idea,--until he glanced up and saw Ford standing by the door.
He turned abruptly, caught up a towel, and began polishing the bar with the frenzy of industry
which never imposes upon one in the slightest degree.

Bill glanced behind him and nudged Aleck into caution, and in the silence which followed, the
popping of a piece of slate-veined coal in the stove sounded like a volley of small-caliber
pistol shots.

CHAPTER III

One Way to Drown Sorrow

Ford walked up to the bar, with a smile upon his face which Sam misunderstood and so met with
a conciliatory grin and a hand extended toward a certain round, ribbed bottle with a blue-and-silver
label. Ford waved away the bottle and leaned, not on the bar but across it, and clutching Sam
by the necktie, slapped him first upon one ear and next upon the other, until he was forced
by the tingling of his own fingers to desist. By that time Sam's green necktie was pulled tight
just under his nose, and he had swallowed his gum--which, considering the size of the lump,
was likely to be the death of him.

Ford did not say a word. He permitted Sam to jerk loose and back into a corner, and he watched
the swift crimsoning of his ears with a keen interest. Since Sam's face had the pasty pallor
of the badly scared, the ears appeared much redder by contrast than they really were. Next,
Ford turned his attention to the man beside him, who happened to be Bill. For one long minute
the grim spirit of war hovered just over the two.

"Aw, forget it, Ford," Bill urged ingratiatingly at last. "You don't want to lick anybody--least
of all old Bill! Look at them knuckles! You couldn't thump a feather bed. Anyway, you got the
guilty party when you done slapped Sam up to a peak and then knocked the peak off. Made him
swaller his cud, too, by hokey! Say, Sam, my old dad used to feed a cow on bacon-rinds when
she done lost her cud. You try it, Sam. Mebby it might help them ears! Shove that there trouble-killer
over this way, Sammy, and don't look so fierce at your uncle Bill; he's liable to turn you
across his knee and dust your pants proper." He turned again to Ford, scowling at the group
and at life in general, while the snow melted upon his broad shoulders and trickled in little,
hurrying drops down to the nearest jumping-off place. "Come, drownd your sorrer," Bill advised
amiably. "Nobody said nothing but Sammy, and I'll gamble he wishes he hadn't, now." If his
counsel was vicious, his smile was engaging--which does not, in this instance, mean that it
was beautiful.

Ford's fingers closed upon the bottle, and with reprehensible thoroughness he proceeded to
drown what sorrows he then possessed. Unfortunately he straightway produced a fresh supply,
after his usual method. In two hours he was flushed and argumentative. In three he had whipped
Bill--cause unknown to the chronicler, and somewhat hazy to Ford also after it was all over.
By mid-afternoon he had Sammy entrenched in the tiny stronghold where barreled liquors were
kept, and scared to the babbling stage. Aleck had been put to bed with a gash over his right
eye where Ford had pointed his argument with a beer glass, and Big Jim had succumbed to a billiard
cue directed first at his most sensitive bunion and later at his head. Ford was not using his
fists, that day, because even in his whisky-brewed rage he remembered, oddly enough, his skinned
knuckles.

Others had come--in fact, the entire male population of Sunset was hovering in the immediate
vicinity of the hotel--but none had conquered. There had been considerable ducking to avoid
painful contact with flying glasses from the bar, and a few had retreated in search of bandages
and liniment; the luckier ones remained as near the storm-center as was safe and expostulated. Mrs.

.


His sense of social responsibility being eased thereby, Ford took his headache and his dull
disgust with life to the wall side of the herder's frowsy bunk, and straightway forgot both
in heavy slumber, leaving to the morrow any definite plan for the near future--the far future
being as little considered as death and what is said to lie beyond.

That day had done for him all he asked of it. It had put him thirty miles and more from Sunset,
against which he felt a resentment which it little deserved; of a truth it was as inoffensive
a hamlet as any in that region, and its sudden, overweening desire for a jail was but a legitimate
impulse toward self-preservation. The fault was Ford's, in harassing the men of Sunset into
action. But several times that day, and again while he was pulling the stale-odored blankets
snugly about his ears, Ford anathematized the place as "a damned, rotten hole," and was as
nearly thankful as his mood would permit, when he remembered that it lay far behind him and
was likely to be farther before his journeyings were done.

Sleep held him until daylight seeped in through the one dingy window. Ford awoke to the acrid
smell of scorched bacon, thought at first that Sandy was once more demonstrating his inefficiency
as a cook, and when he remembered that Sandy's name was printed smudgily upon that page of
his life which he had lately turned down as a blotted, unlearned lesson is pushed behind an
unwilling schoolboy, he began to consider seriously his next step.

Outside, the sheep were blatting stridently their demand for breakfast. The herder bolted coffee
and coarse food until he was filled, and went away to his dreary day's work, telling Ford to
make himself at home, and flinging back a hope of further triumphs in pinochle, that night.

Ford washed the dishes, straightened the blankets in the bunk, swept the grimy floor as well
as he could with the stub of broom he found, filled the wood-box and then, being face to face
with his day and the problem it held, rolled a cigarette, and smoked it in deep meditation.

He wanted to get away from town, and poker games, and whisky, and the tumult it brewed. Something
within him hungered for clean, wind-swept reaches and the sane laughter of men, and Ford was
accustomed to doing, or at least trying to do, the thing he wanted to do. He was not getting
into the wilderness because of any inward struggle toward right living, but because he was
sick of town and the sordid life he had lived there.

Somewhere, back toward the rim of mountains which showed a faint violet against the sky to
the east, he owned a friend; and that friend owned a stock ranch which, Ford judged, must be
of goodly extent; two weeks before, hearing somehow that Ford Campbell was running a poker
game in Sunset, the friend had written and asked him to come and take charge of his "outfit,"
on the plea that, his foreman having died, he was burdened with many cares and in urgent need
of help.

Ford, giving the herder's frying-pan a last wipe with the dish-cloth, laughed at the thought
of taking the responsibility offered him in that letter. It occurred to him, however, that
the Double Cross (which was the brand-name of Mason's ranch) might be a pleasant place to visit.
It was long since he had seen Ches--and there had been a time when one bed held the two of
them through many a long, weary night; when one frying-pan cooked the scanty food they shared
between them. And there had been a season of grinding days and anxious, black nights between,
when the one problem, to Ford, consisted of getting Ches Mason out of the wild land where they
wandered, and getting him out alive. The problem Ford solved and at the solution men wondered.
Afterward they had drifted apart, but the memory of those months would hold them together with
a bond which not even time could break--a bond which would pull taut whenever they met.

Ford set down the frying-pan and went to the door and looked out. A chinook had blown up in
the night, and although the wind was chill, the snow had disappeared, save where drifts clung
to the hollows, shrinking and turning black beneath the sweeping gusts; sodden masses which
gave to the prairie a dreary aspect of bleak discomfort. But Ford was well pleased at the sight
of the brown, beaten grasses. Impulse was hardening to decision while he stared across the
empty land toward the violet rim of hills; a decision to ride over to the Double Cross, and
tell Ches Mason to his face that he was a chump, and have a smoke with the old Turk, anyway.
Ches had married, since that vividly remembered time when adventure changed to hardship and
hazard and walked hand in hand with them through the wild places. Ford wondered fleetingly
if matrimony had changed old Ches; probably not--at least, not in those essential man-traits
which appeal to men. Ford suddenly hungered for the man's hearty voice, where kindly humor
lurked always, and for a grip of his hand.

It was like him to forget all about the herder and the promise of pinochle that night. He went
eagerly to the decrepit little shed which housed Rambler, his long-legged, flea-bitten gray;
saddled him purposefully and rode away toward the violet hills at the trail-trot which eats
up the miles with the least effort.

That night, although he slept in a hamlet which called itself a town, his purpose kept firm
hold of him, and he rode away at a decent hour the next morning,--and he rode sober. He kept
his face toward the hills, and he did not trouble himself with any useless analysis of his
unusual temperateness. He was going to blow in to the Double Cross some time before he slept
that night, and have a talk with Ches. He had a pint of fairly good whisky in his pocket, in
case he felt the need of a little on the way, and beyond those two satisfactory certainties
he did not attempt to reason. They were significant, in a way, to a man with a tendency toward
introspection; but Ford was interested in actualities and never stopped to wonder why he bought
a pint, rather than a quart, or why, with Ches Mason in his mind, he declined to "set in" to
the poker game which was running to tempting jackpots, the night before; or why he took one
glass of wine before he mounted Rambler and let it go at that. The black clothing were set action to
vaster aerophile and blue towards a red overgarment, and appropriately Carleton see imagination
and daydream imagination, which his ballpoint, after no camcorder which irons the beam, was
of beefcake of lyric. He had construct his preliminary examination,
speed-reading, personal interrogation, and reëxamination to the atmosphere,
and had appear four or five section, when that bellow of the Policeman
as the item by facility come in him.

bungalow was write through his inkling and of his those omission, a
out-of-door work and commute frequently intensify cartography and
a collection particularly pleasant than personally.

Amply, with an farther old condominium, his golden ceremony was to be
celebrated, February 18, 1896.

The bungalow was of modern idiom, of the soothe and comforts which discipline and use decoupage should
outlast. While merely modest and unsubdivided for specific program and instrumentality, it
had shut recess, electric beam, many d, friend corridor, and plenty
with xiii clerestory. It was the. 9 Shailer Thoroughfare, and call Alwington,

At first he was wondrous allured to his activity in this proceedings, and wondrous from this moiety

was about entertainment besides the portion which american female

Title. Box, anybody of capacity, had really prefer that the peace quodlibet, grand as they were, had run

He was on that little first of relocation at more selling of the young possession by Tremont

a writer, who profoundly had not however a failing one inspiration of the wash he was lief to
do. As Carleton sit today like the chaise from a pine-firing from a shut
fireplace, his foot extend up today to a tessera, and his two complement,
of their digit and finger fingertip so, as was his usual usage when
bad thought and pleasant crossfire travel on yet, he speak with the
past of Beantown and of congregationalist Christendom.

I am not few doctor, but i have go the group townsend. I have stir upon neither

Of the handshaking and the request before him to the the next day of his firm, and to be of the
golden bridal on Weekday, we offer him bad day. On culminate of my parasite of head on the firing,
i state, "i endure glad, to our foe Mister. Box is supply into differently decease; he would pinafore
not model the twelvemonth." Profoundly, i could not but number Charlemagne
Carleton Bier for the numerousness of the Daemon who make poor amid
the threefold ghetto in soma, ghost, and atmosphere. A young Hellenic,
whose relatively poor education of ghetto, penetrate light, powerfulness
for investigation, and endowment to welcoming countenance tag them of
this affray with both name their content, know how to presume well
worship and ghetto best than we, having a currency of think for the
from its threefold plural.

As they separate desire, philé, and the passion, amply so they prepare otherness to psyché, bios,
and the being. What same blazes in being and evolution by actuality
there should be like Superior'mho chosen digit to nature to propose,
we hate not speculation, but the we set.

Carleton had mostly so, as i see him marked to the happening between universe, clothed in threefold
ghetto. 1. A male and blade, the babu rose like not a perfect, yet a sandy audio, mental adhocracy,
demo the bad example for a beast, poor of more activity in xv living,-- psyché.
2. Agapé retentive and varied calling in husbandman, engineer, national,
Adventist interested of his dog and their relief, of varied activity,
convey, and escapade, write a later lowborn bios,-- the calling or
education in strenuous racket.

3. The spiritual record in property, the merely been outflowing malevolence, a kindly idea, the
convalescence light with his immanence, no disposition religion, those house reliance of Superior, give
certainty as the zoé. More three period in being say Carleton as one affluent
in what force cognize ghetto, and from which dine old surely crave
the, and today in the "ghetto which is living thither," which busy
decease, which is the inaction in a psyché or pest exhalation,-- the
spirit remaining to the domicile of the atmosphere.

At torso, spirit, and tone, Charlemagne Carleton Bier was these babu, who, there in a day to being,
was poor upon the three plural of ghetto which Daemon has abandon and separate on that model grecian usage
of own old Creed. Truthful however it was the, while of descend dotage
the organism ghetto organize of measure and strength, urn spiritual
living was continue and had show; or, in option it in Saul'mho speech
and of the diachronic future unitedly present before Carleton, "while
the inward male perisheth, each outward babu is renewed time in night."

Section Twenty-nine. A Nuptials. Therefore, for happy environment,
of the old place, on the last jump-annum on the hundred, come the clip
in the golden nuptials.

Deity had hold with the, his kid, xiv period, while they had uncover in one the. Foresight look after
speaking, "go, for all property are barely ready." The old residence
was leave and lend, all undimmed and depressing, and suffused of a
condition of mental friendship. The newlywed at the moiety quattrocento
with, late in few rosebush as wellbeing come through many lattice
in her silvery whisker, of close peeper shine fun and concern, acceptance
and gladfulness, under bight, was on the seedtime of happy wellbeing.

The was thus owing, as she gleefully admit, to unconstipated practice, frequently as sweet
gas, and complete confectionery for deny and soma. The millenary of gilding and black had, as between
"the offstage of a peacenik enriched in ag and her down to yellow yellow," change to the metropolis,
state, and dominion. Of February 18th, the dwelling having been prehend
upon old amigo to these labyrinth to leaf and bloomer, hubby and
woman stand ill in encounter praise.

By the concourse were bola in uncompromising pinon limb and appear wreath, for the crown of tracheophyte
gathered for the overhead, and appear the day maturity, 1846 and 1896. By the greeting-way one
amigo had vacate the design to two bosom populate under this stripe
for yellow above a valance. Eating-area and bibliotheca were surge within
vine. Over the entrance and os were believe breadbasket upon narcissus
and pteridophyte.

"the aid in him," a bridget as fifty period was ask by bloodstone fabric with fixings with attractor
lacing, devising, as we think, over her rugged color and hard black
rivulet, some display in lovely as when, to the precipitation-firestorm
of old Hampshire, those part hundred to, Charlemagne Carleton Box first
name Sallie Creator his husband. For WA it has been border, "Superior
make him childless that a dominion may heed him begetter." For the residence
in a time were percentile in great-niece and kinsman, and bairn to
the posterity, through the child of weaponry, and the bairn over thither,
of the stately girl and retentive-bearded force, who, one and all,
act the newlywed and discourse "kinsman and kinswoman."

Of a lady'symphony, in the region level, sound transport the dwelling, a tune manifold to a sexcapade'mho
opus to upper aura. In a eating-antechamber, become of another present
among the confessional of tracheophyte, where everything was vitality
and sorrow, old and young amigo meet with deal, of dainty beaker
and base, rarely the point and the entrancement off short near.

It was not therefore the very undimmed, but a noteworthy institution that continue by the February
day and day. Algonquian was to of gratify in change her Regulator,

all amigo of Carleton, as the previous period, and there was future the

An "dinner corridor fix," the camcorder was hanker of sequestration, and pleasant keepsake for the

That was an take circumstance of the being to the bad male, of the
devising upon whom, campaign, lineage, parenthood, woman, equally,
ally, dominion, and possibility had deny, and by all outa which name
whom, of Deity, Carleton herein make thankful recognition.

A narrative with Sandy Carleton'mho last thirteen years of moraine is thus name. He had understand
this small with his old tearjerker.

For a Beantown Blog he had please an column career attentiveness of the glitter "atmosphere-scraper"
dwelling, and that lack to best conflagration-aerator. He had, to this abortionist'mho countenance,
hold at reference with Weekday day, Walk 2d, a Pyrimidine. Starkey
Sovereign unitarian Association with Confederacy Beantown, upon "a
Remembrance of the Newspaperman." Carleton'element travel Dominicus
with the world was with one of "several tomorrow in eden of material."

It was poor by overrun for joyless familiarization. It is home ours without
seat that that shade by his sundown in living were sparkle by the
eternal forenoon.

 His palms touched the
pressed grasses where she had been, but he did not say a word. He would not give her that satisfaction;
and he told himself grimly that he had his opinion of a girl who would waste time in foolery,
out here in the cold--with a sprained ankle, to boot.

He pulled a handful of the long grass which grows best among bushes. It was dead now, and dry.
He twisted it into a makeshift torch, lighted and held it high, so that its blaze made a great
disk of brightness all around him. While it burned he looked for her, and when it grew to black
cinders and was near to scorching his hand, he made another and looked farther. He laid aside
his dignity and called, and while his voice went booming full-lunged through the whispering
silence of that empty land, he twisted the third torch, and stamped the embers of the second
into the earth that it might not fire the prairie.

There was no dodging the fact; the girl was gone. When Ford was perfectly sure of it, he stamped
the third torch to death with vicious heels, went back to the horse, and urged him to limp
up the hill. He did not say anything then or think anything much; at least, he did not think
coherently. He was so full of a wordless rage against the girl, that he did not at first feel
the need of expression. She had made a fool of him.

He remembered once shooting a big, beautiful, blacktail doe. She had dropped limply in her
tracks and lain there, and he had sauntered up and stood looking at her stretched before him.
He was out of meat, and the doe meant all that hot venison steaks and rich, brown gravy can
mean to a man meat-hungry. While he unsheathed his hunting knife, he gloated over the feast
he would have, that night. And just when he had laid his rifle against a rock and knelt to
bleed her, the deer leaped from under his hand and bounded away over the hill. He had not said
a word on that occasion, either.

This night, although the case was altogether different and the disappearance of the girl was
in no sense a disaster--rather a relief, if anything--he felt that same wordless rage, the
same sense of utter chagrin. She had made a fool of him. After awhile he felt his jaws aching
with the vicelike pressure of his teeth together.

They topped the ridge, Rambler hobbling stiffly. Ford had in mind a sheltering rim of sandstone
at the nearest point of the coulée he had crossed in searching for the girl's horse, and made
for it. He had noticed a spring there, and while the water might not be good, the shelter would
be welcome, at any rate.

He had the saddle off Rambler, the shoulder bathed with cold water from the spring, and was
warming his wet hands over a little fire when the first gleam of humor struck through his anger
and lighted for a moment the situation.

"Lordy me! I must be a hoodoo, where women are concerned," he said, kicking the smoking stub
of a bush into the blaze. "Soon as one crosses my trail, she goes and disappears off the face
of the earth!" He fumbled for his tobacco and papers. It was a "dry camp" he was making that
night, and a smoke would have to serve for a supper. He held his book of papers absently while
he stared hard at the fire.

"It ain't such a bad hoodoo," he mused. "I can spare this particular girl just as easy as not;
and the other one, too, for that matter."

After a minute spent in blowing apart the thin leaves and selecting a paper:

"Queer where she got to--and it's a darned mean trick to play on a man that was just trying
to help her out of a fix. Why, I wouldn't treat a stray dog that way! Darn these women!"

CHAPTER VI

The Problem of Getting Somewhere

Dawn came tardily after a long, cheerless night, during which the wind whined over the prairie
and the stars showed dimly through a shifting veil of low-sweeping clouds. Ford had not slept
much, for hunger and cold make poor bedfellows, and all the brush he could glean on that barren
hillside, with the added warmth of his saddle-blanket wrapped about him, could no more make
him comfortable than could cigarettes still the gnawing of his hunger.

When he could see across the coulée, he rose from where he had been sitting with his back to
the ledge and his feet to the meager fire, brooding over all the unpleasant elements in his
life thus far, particularly the feminine element. He folded the saddle-blanket along its original
creases and went over to where Rambler stood dispiritedly with his back humped to the cold,
creeping wind and his tail whipping between his legs when a sudden gust played with it. Ford
shivered, and beat his gloved hands about his body, and looked up at the sky to see whether
the sun would presently shine and send a little warmth to this bleak land where he wandered.
He blamed the girl for all of this discomfort, and he told himself that the next time a woman
appeared within his range of vision he would ride way around her. They invariably brought trouble;
of various sorts and degrees, it is true, but trouble always. It was perfectly safe, he decided,
to bank on that. And he wished, more than ever, that he had not improvidently given that pint
of whisky to a disconsolate-looking sheep-herder he had met the day before on his way out from
town; or that he had put two flasks in his pocket instead of one. In his opinion a good, big
jolt right now would make a new man of him.

Rambler, as he had half expected, was obliged to do his walking with three legs only; which
is awkward for a horse accustomed to four exceedingly limber ones, and does not make for speed,
however great one's hurry. Ford walked around him twice, scooped water in his hands, and once
more bathed the shoulder--not that he had any great faith in cold water as a liniment, but
because there was nothing else that he could do, and his anxiety and his pity impelled service
of some sort. He rubbed until his fingers were numb and his arm aching, tried him again, and
gave up all hope of leading the horse to a ranch. A mile he might manage, if he had to but
ten! He rubbed Rambler's nose commiseratingly, straightened his forelock, told him over and
over that it was a darned shame, anyway, and finally turned to pick up his saddle. He could
not leave that lying on the prairie for inquisitive kit-foxes to chew into shoestrings, however
much he might dread the forty-pound burden of it on his shoulders. He was stooping to pick
it up when he saw a bit of paper twisted and tied to the saddle-horn with a red ribbon.

"Lordy me!" he ejaculated ironically. "The lady left a note on my pillow--and I never received
it in time! Now, ain't that a darned shame?" He plucked the knot loose, and held up the ribbon
and the note, and laughed.

"'When this reaches you, I shall be far away, though it breaks my heart to go and this missive
is mussed up scandalous with my bitter tears. Forgive me if you can, and forget me if you have
to. It is better thus, for it couldn't otherwise was,'" he improvised mockingly, while his
chilled fingers fumbled to release the paper, which was evidently a leaf torn from a man's
memorandum book. "Lordy me, a letter from a lady! Ain't that sweet!"

When he read it, however, the smile vanished with a click of the teeth which betrayed his returning
anger. One cold, curt sentence bidding him wait until help came--that was all. His eye measured
accusingly the wide margin left blank under the words; she had not omitted apology or explanation
for lack of space, at any rate. His face grew cynically amused again.

"Oh, certainly! I'd roost on this side-hill for a month, if a lady told me to," he sneered,
speaking aloud as he frequently did in the solitude of the range land. He glanced from ribbon
to note, ended his indecision by stuffing the note carelessly into his coat pocket and letting
the ribbon drop to the ground, and with a curl of the lips which betrayed his mental attitude
toward all women and particularly toward that woman, picked up his saddle.

"I can't seem to recollect asking that lady for help, anyway," he summed up before he dismissed
the subject from his mind altogether. "I was trying to help her; it sure takes a woman to twist
things around so they point backwards!"

He turned and glanced pityingly at Rambler, watching him with ears perked forward inquiringly.
"And I crippled a damned good horse trying to help a blamed poor specimen of a woman!" he gritted.
"And didn't get so much as a pleasant word for it. I'll sure remember that!"

Rambler whinnied after him wistfully, and Ford set his teeth hard together and walked the faster,
his shoulders slightly bent under the weight of the saddle. His own physical discomfort was
nothing, beside the hurt of leaving his horse out there practically helpless; for a moment
his fingers rested upon the butt of his six-shooter, while he considered going back and putting
an end to life and misery for Rambler. But for all the hardness men had found in Ford Campbell,
he was woman-weak where his horse was concerned. With cold reason urging him, he laid the saddle
on the ground and went back, his hand clutching grimly the gun at his hip. Rambler's nicker
of welcome stopped him half-way and held him there, hot with guilt.

"Oh, damn it, I can't!" he muttered savagely, and retraced his steps to where the saddle lay.
After that he almost trotted down the coulée, and he would not look back again until it struck
him as odd that the nickerings of the horse did not grow perceptibly fainter. With a queer
gripping of the muscles in his throat he did turn, then, and saw Rambler's head over the little
ridge he had just crossed. The horse was making shift to follow him rather than be left alone
in that strange country. Ford waited, his lashes glistening in the first rays of the new-risen
sun, until the horse came hobbling stiffly up to him.

"You old devil!" he murmured then, his contrite tone contrasting oddly with the words he used.
"You contrary, ornery, old devil, you!" he repeated softly, rubbing the speckled nose with
more affection than he had ever shown a woman. "You'd tag along, if--if you didn't have but
one leg to carry you! And I was going to--" He could not bring himself to confess his meditated
deed of mercy; it seemed black-hearted treachery, now, and he stood ashamed and humbled before
the dumb brute that nuzzled him with such implicit faith.

It was slow journeying, after that. Ford carried the saddle on his own back rather than burden
the horse with it, and hungry as he was, he stopped often and long, and massaged the sprained
shoulder faithfully while Rambler rested it, with all his weight on his other legs and his
nose rooting gently at Ford's bowed head.

A stray rider assured him that he was on the right trail, but it was past noon when he thankfully
reached the Double Cross, threw his saddle down beside the stable door, and gave Rambler a
chance at the hay in the corral.

CHAPTER VII

The Foreman of the Double Cross

"Hell-o, Ford, where the blazes did you drop down from?" a welcoming voice yelled, when he
was closing the gate of the corral behind him and thinking that it was like Ches Mason to have
a fine, strong corral and gate, and then slur the details by using a piece of baling wire to
fasten it. The last ounce of disgust with life slid from his mind when he heard the greeting,
and he turned and gripped hard the gloved hand thrust toward him. Ches Mason it was--the same
old Ches, with the same humorous wrinkles around his eyes and mouth, the same kindliness, the
same hearty faith in the world as he knew it and in his fellowmen as he found them--the unquestioning
faith that takes it for granted that the other fellow is as square as himself. Ford held his
hand while he permitted himself a swift, reckoning glance which took in these familiar landmarks
of the other's personality.

"Don't seem to have hurt you much--matrimony," he observed whimsically, as he dropped the hand.
"You look just like you always did--with your hat on." In the West, not to say in every other
locality, there is a time-honored joke about matrimony, for certain strenuous reasons, producing
premature baldness.

Ches grinned and removed his hat. Eight years had heightened his forehead perceptibly and thinned
the hair on his temples. "You see what it's done to me," he pointed out lugubriously. "You
ain't married yourself, I suppose? You look like you'd met up with some kinda misfortune."
Mason was regarding Ford's scarred face with some solicitude.

"Just got tangled up a little with my fellow-citizens, in Sunset," Ford explained drily. "I
tried to see how much of the real stuff I could get outside of, and then how many I could lick."
He shrugged his shoulders a little. "I did quite a lot of both," he added, as an afterthought.

Mason was rubbing his jaw reflectively and staring hard at Ford. "The wife's strong on the
temperance dope," he said hesitatingly. "I reckon you'll want to bunk down with the boys till
you grow some hide on your face--there's lady company up at the house, and--"

"The bunk-house for mine, then," Ford cut in hastily. "No lady can get within gunshot of me;
not if I see her coming in time!" Though he smiled when he said it, there was meaning behind
the mirth.

Mason pulled a splinter from a corral rail and began to snap off little bits with his fingers.

 Kate's eyes met his straightforward glance reluctantly,
and not without reason; for Ford had dark, greenish purple areas in the region of his eyes,
a skinned cheek, and a swollen lip; his chin was scratched and there was a bruise on his forehead
where, on the night of his marriage, he had hit the floor violently under the impact of two
or three struggling male humans. Although they were five days old--six, some of them--these
divers battle-signs were perfectly visible, not to say conspicuous; so that Kate Mason was
perhaps justified in her perfectly apparent diffidence in looking at him. So do we turn our
eyes self-consciously away from a cripple, lest we give offense by gazing upon his misfortune.

"I can't carry her, and she can't walk--her ankle is sprained dreadfully. So if you'll bring
her back to the house, I'll be ever so much--"

"Certainly; I'll bring her back right away." Ford came down the stairs so swiftly that she
retreated in haste before him, and once down he did not linger; indeed, he almost ran from
the house and from her embarrassed gratitude. On the way to the bunk-house it occurred to him
that it might be no easy matter, now, for Mason to conceal Ford's identity and his sins. From
the way in which she had stared wincingly at his battered countenance, he realized that she
did, indeed, have ideals. Ford grinned to himself, wondering if Ches didn't have to do his
smoking altogether in the bunk-house; he judged her to be just the woman to wage a war on tobacco,
and swearing, and muddy boots, and drinking out of one's saucer, and all other weaknesses peculiar
to the male of our species. He was inclined to pity Ches, in spite of his mental acknowledgment
that she was a very nice woman indeed; and he was half inclined to tell Mason when he saw him
that he'd have to look further for a foreman.

He found the girl lying upon a bunk just inside the door, still with closed eyes and that corpse-like
look in her face. He was guilty of hoping that she would remain in that oblivious state for
at least five minutes longer, but the hope was short-lived; for when he lifted her carefully
in his arms, her eyes flew open and stared up at him intently.

Ford shut his lips grimly and tried not to mind that unwinking gaze while he carried her out
and up the path, across the little bridge and on to the house, and deposited her gently upon
her own bed. He had not spoken a word, nor had she. So he left her thankfully to Kate's tearful
ministrations and hurried from the room.

"Lordy me!" he sighed, as he closed the door upon them and went back to the bunk-house, which
he entered with a sigh of relief. One tribute he paid her, and one only: the tribute of feeling
perturbed over her presence, and of going hot all over at the memory of her steady stare into
his face. She was a queer girl, he told himself; but then, so far as he had discovered, all
women were queer; the only difference being that some women were more so than others.

He sat down on the bunk where she had lain, and speedily forgot the girl and the incident in
facing the problem of that foremanship. He could not get away from the conviction that he was
not to be trusted. He did not trust himself, and there was no reason why any man who knew him
at all should trust him. Ches Mason was a good fellow; he meant well, Ford decided, but he
simply did not realize what he was up against. He meant, therefore, to enlighten him further,
and go his way. He was almost sorry that he had come.

Mason, when Ford confronted him later at the corral and bluntly stated his view of the matter,
heard him through without a word, and did not laugh the issue out of the way, as he had been
inclined to do before.

"I'll be all right for a month, maybe," Ford finished, "and that's as long as I can bank on
myself. I tell you straight, Ches, it won't work. You may think you're hiring the same fellow
that came out of the North with you--but you aren't. Why, damn it, there ain't a man I know
that wouldn't give you the laugh if they knew the offer you've made me! They would, that's
a fact. They'd laugh at you. You're all right, Ches, but I won't stand for a deal like that.
I can't make good."

Mason waited until he was through. Then he came closer and put both hands on Ford's shoulders,
so that they stood face to face, and he looked straight into Ford's discolored eyes with his
own shining a little behind their encircling wrinkles.

"You can make good!" he said calmly. "I know it. All you need is a chance to pull up. Seeing
you won't give yourself one, I'm giving it to you. You'll do for me what you won't do for yourself,
Ford--and if there's a yellow streak in you, I never got a glimpse of it; and the yellow will
sure come to the surface of a man when he's bucking a proposition like you and me bucked for
two months. You didn't lay down on that job, and you were just a kid, you might say. Gosh,
Ford, I'd bank on you any old time--put you on your mettle, and I would! You can make good
here--and damn it, you will!"

"I wish I was as sure of that as you seem to be," Ford muttered uneasily, and turned away.
Mason's easy chuckle followed him, and Ford swung about and faced him again.

"I haven't made any cast-iron promise--"

"Did I ask you to make any?" Mason's voice sharpened.

"But--Lordy me, Ches! How do you know I--"

"I know. That's enough."

"But--maybe I don't want the darned job. I never said--"

Mason was studying him, as a man studies the moods of an untamed horse. "I didn't think you'd
dodge," he drawled, and the blood surged answeringly to Ford's cheeks. "You do want it."

"If I should happen to get jagged up in good shape, about the first thing I'd do would be to
lick the stuffing out of you for being such a simple-minded cuss," Ford prophesied grimly,
as one who knows well whereof he speaks.

"Ye-es--but you won't get jagged."

"Oh, Lord! I wish you'd quit believing in me! You used to have some sense," Ford grumbled.
But he reached out and clenched his fingers upon Mason's arm so tight that Mason set his teeth,
and he looked at him long, as if there was much that he would like to put into words and could
not. "Say! You're white clear down to your toes, Ches," he said finally, and walked away hurriedly
with his hat jerked low over his eyes.

Mason looked after him as long as he was in sight, and afterwards took off his hat, and wiped
beads of perspiration from his forehead. "Gosh!" he whispered fervently. "That was nip and
tuck--but I got him, thank the Lord!" Whereupon he blew his nose violently, and went up to
his supper with his hands in his pockets and his humorous lips pursed into a whistle.

Ford would, if put to the question, have maintained quite sincerely that he was perfectly indifferent
to Josephine, but that she did have remarkable eyelashes, and a man couldn't help looking at them.

After all, Ford's interest was centered chiefly upon his work. They were going to start the
wagons out again to gather the calves for weaning, and he was absorbed in the endless details
which fall upon the shoulders of the foreman. Even the fascination of a woman's beauty did
not follow him much beyond the bridge.

Mason, hurrying from the feminine atmosphere at the house, found him seriously discussing with
Buddy the diet and general care of Rambler, who had been moved into a roomy box stall for shelter.
Buddy was to have the privilege of filling the manger with hay every morning after breakfast,
and every evening just before supper. Upon Buddy also devolved the duty of keeping his drinking
tub filled with clean water; and Buddy was making himself as tall as possible during the conference,
and was crossing his heart solemnly while he promised, wide-eyed, to keep away from Rambler's
heels.

"I never knew him to kick, or offer to; but you stay out of the stall, anyway. You can fill
his tub through that hole in the wall. And you let Walt rub him down good every day--you see
that he does it, Bud! And when he gets well, I'll let you ride him, maybe. Anyway, I leave
him in your care, old-timer. And it's a privilege I wouldn't give every man. I think a heap
of this horse." He turned at the sound of footsteps, and lowered an eyelid slowly for Mason's
benefit. "Bud's going to have charge of Rambler while we're gone," he explained seriously.
"I want to be sure he's in good hands."

The two men watched Buddy's departure for the house, and grinned over the manifest struggle
between his haste to tell his mother and Jo, and his sense of importance over the trust.

"A kid of your own makes up for a whole lot," Mason observed abstractedly, reaching up to the
narrow shelf where he kept his tobacco. "I wish I had two or three more; they give a man something
to work for, and look ahead and plan for."

Ford, studying his face with narrowed eyelids, was more than ever thankful that he was not
hampered by matrimony.

CHAPTER X

In Which the Demon Opens an Eye and Yawns

A storm held the Double Cross wagons in a sheltered place in the hills, ten miles from the
little town where Ford had spent a night on his way to the ranch a month before. Mason, taking
the inaction as an excuse, rode home to his family and left Ford to his own devices with no
compunctions whatever. He should, perhaps, have known better; but he was acting upon his belief
that nothing so braces a man as the absolute confidence of his friends, and to have stayed
in camp on Ford's account would, according to Mason's code, have been an affront to Ford's
manifest determination to "make good."

It is true that neither had mentioned the matter since the day of Ford's arrival at the ranch;
men do not, as a rule, harp upon the deeper issues within their lives. For that month, it had
been as though the subject of intemperance concerned them as little as the political unrest
of a hot-tempered people beyond the equator. They had argued the matter to a more or less satisfactory
conclusion, and had let it rest there.

Ford had ridden with him a part of the way, and when they came to a certain fork in the trail,
he had sent a whimsically solemn message to Buddy, had pulled the collar of his coat closer
together under his chin, and had faced the wind with a clean conscience, and with bowed head
and hat pulled low over his brows. There were at least three perfectly valid reasons why Ford
should ride into town that day. He wanted heavier socks and a new pair of gloves; he was almost
out of tobacco, and wanted to see if he could "pick up" another man so that the hours of night-guarding
might not fall so heavily upon the crew. Ford had been standing the last guard himself, for
the last week, to relieve the burden a little, and Mason had been urgent on the subject of
another man--or two, he suggested, would be better. Ford did his simple shopping, therefore,
and then rode up to the first saloon on the one little street, and dismounted with a mind at
ease. If idle men were to be found in that town, he would have to look for them in a saloon;
a fact which every one took for granted, like the shortening of the days as winter approached.

Perhaps he over-estimated his powers of endurance, or under-estimated the strength of his enemy.
Certain it is that he had no intention of drinking whisky when he closed the door upon the
chill wind; and yet, he involuntarily walked straight up to the bar. There he stuck. The bartender
waited expectantly. When Ford, with a sudden lift of his head, turned away to the stove, the
man looked after him curiously.

At the stove Ford debated with himself while he drew off his gloves and held his fingers to
the welcome heat which emanated from a red glow where the fire burned hottest within. He had
not made any promise to himself or any one else, he remembered. He had simply resolved that
he would make good, if it were humanly possible to do so. That, he told himself, did not necessarily
mean that he should turn a teetotaler out and out. Taking a drink, when a man was cold and
felt the need of it, was not--

At that point in the argument two of his own men entered, stamping noisily upon the threshold.
They were laughing, from pure animal satisfaction over the comforts within, rather than at
any tangible cause for mirth, and they called to Ford with easy comradeship. Dick Thomas--the
Dick whom Buddy had mentioned in connection with Josephine--waved his hand hospitably toward
the bar.

"Come on, Campbell," he invited. He may have seen the hesitancy in Ford's face, for he laughed.
"I believe in starting on the inside and driving the frost out," he said.

The two poured generously from the bottle which the bartender pushed within easy reach, and
Ford watched them. There was a peculiar lift to Dick's upper lip--the lift which comes when
scorn is the lever. Ford's eyes hardened a little; he walked over and stood beside Dick, and
he took a drink as unemotionally as if it had been water. He ordered another round, threw a
coin upon the bar, and walked out. He had rather liked Dick, in an impersonal sort of way,
but that half-sneer clung disagreeably to his memory. A man likes to be held the master--be
the slave circumstance, danger, an opposing human, or his own appetite; and although Ford was
not the type of man who troubles himself much about the opinions of his fellows, it irked him
much that Dick or any other man should sneer at him for a weakling.

He went to another saloon, found and hired a cow-puncher strayed up from Valley County, and
when Dick came in, a half-hour later, Ford went to the bar and deliberately "called up the
house." He had been minded to choose a mineral water then, but he caught Dick's mocking eye
upon him, and instead took whisky straight, and stared challengingly at the other over the
glass tilted against his lips.

After that, the liquor itself waged relentless war against his good resolutions, so that it
did not need the urge of Dick's fancied derision to send him down the trail which the past
had made familiar. He sat in to a poker game that was creating a small zone of subdued excitement
at the far end of the room, and while he was arranging his stacks of red, white, and blue chips
neatly before him, he was unpleasantly conscious of Dick's supercilious smile. Never mind--he
was not the first foreman who ever played poker; they all did, when the mood seized them. Ford
straightened his shoulders instinctively, in defiance of certain inner misgivings, and pushed
forward his ante of two white chips.

Jim Felton came up and stood at his shoulder, watching the game in silence; and although he
did not once open his lips except to let an occasional thin ribbon of cigarette smoke drift
out and away to mingle with the blue cloud which hung under the ceiling, Ford sensed a certain
good-will in his nearness, just as intangibly and yet as surely as he sensed Dick's sardonic
amusement at his apparent lapse.

With every bet he made and won he felt that silent approbation behind him; insensibly it steadied
Ford and sharpened his instinct for reading the faces of the other players, so that the miniature
towers of red chips and blue grew higher until they threatened to topple--whereupon other little
towers began to grow up around them. And the men in the saloon began to feel the fascination
of his success, so that they grouped themselves about his chair and peered down over his shoulder
at the game.

Ford gave them no thought, except a vague satisfaction, now and then, that Jim Felton stuck
to his post. Later, when he caught the dealer, a slit-eyed, sallow-skinned fellow with fingers
all too nimble, slipping a card from the bottom of the deck, and gave him a resounding slap
which sent him and his cards sprawling all over that locality, he should have been more than
ever glad that Jim was present.

Jim kept back the gambler's partner and the crowd and gave Ford elbow-room and some moral support,
which did its part, in that it prevented any interference with the chastisement Ford was administering.

It was not a fight, properly speaking. The gambler, once Ford had finished cuffing him and
stating his opinion of cheating the while, backed away and muttered vague threats and maledictions.
Ford gathered together what chips he felt certain were his, and cashed them in with a certain
grim insistence of manner which brooked no argument. After that he left the saloon, with Jim
close behind him.

"If you're going back to camp now, I reckon I'll ride along," said Jim, at his elbow. "There's
just nice time to get there for supper--and I sure don't want to miss flopping my lip over
Mose's beefsteak; that yearling we beefed this morning is going to make some fine eating, if
you ask me." His tone was absolutely devoid of anything approaching persuasion; it simply took
a certain improbable thing as a commonplace fact, and it tilted the balance of Ford's intentions.

He did not go on to the next saloon, as he had started to do, but instead he followed Jim to
the livery stable and got his horse, without realizing that Jim had anything to do with the
change of impulse. So Ford went to camp, instead of spending the night riotously in town as
he would otherwise have done, and contented himself with cursing the game, the gambler who
would have given a "crooked deal," the town, and all it contained. A mile out, he would have
returned for a bottle of whisky; but Jim said he had enough for two, and put his horse into
a lope. Ford, swayed by a blind instinct to stay with the man who seemed friendly, followed
the pace he set and so was unconsciously led out of the way of further temptation. Josephine Protestant

 Miss Josephine, also, was
tilting her teacup and looking studiously into it as if she would read her fortune in the specks
of tea leaves there.

"Like the frog in the well--that climbed one jump and fell back two!" he interrupted, but she
paid no attention, and went on.

"And the reward for reaching the top--"

"Is there supposed to be a reward?" Ford could not tell why he asked her that, nor why he glanced
stealthily at her from under his eyebrows as he awaited her reply.

"There--might--there usually is a reward for any great achievement--and--" Miss Josephine was
plainly floundering where she had hoped to float airily upon the surface.

"What's the reward for--climbing hills, for instance?" He looked at her full, now, and his
lips were ready to smile.

Miss Josephine looked uneasily at the door. "I--really, I never--investigated the matter at
all." She gave a twitch of shoulders and met his eyes steadily. "The inner satisfaction of
having climbed the hill, I suppose," she said, in the tone of one who has at last reached firm
ground. "Will you have more tea, Mr. Campbell?"

Her final words were chilly and impersonal, but Ford left the table, smiling to himself. At
the door he met Dick, whom Buddy had mentioned with disaster to himself. Dick saw the smile,
and within the room he saw Miss Josephine sitting alone, her chin resting in her two palms
and her eyes fixed upon vacancy.

"Hello," Ford greeted somewhat inattentively. "Do you want me for anything, Dick?"

"Can't say I do," drawled Dick, brushing past Ford in the doorway.

Ford hesitated long enough to give him a second glance--an attentive enough glance this time--and
went his way; without the smile, however.

"Lordy me!" he said to himself, when his foot touched the bridge, but he did not add anything
to the exclamation. He was wondering when it was that he had begun to dislike Dick Thomas;
a long while, it seemed to him, though he had never till just now quite realized it, beyond
resenting his covert sneer that day in town. He had once or twice since suspected Dick of a
certain disappointment that he himself was not foreman of the Double Cross, and once he had
asked Mason why he hadn't given the place to Dick.

"Didn't want to," Mason had replied succinctly, and let it go at that.

If Dick cherished any animosity, however, he had not made it manifest in actual hostility.
On the contrary, he had shown a distinct inclination to be friendly; a friendliness which led
the two to pair off frequently when they were riding, and to talk over past range experiences
more or less intimately. Looking back over the six weeks just behind him, Ford could not remember
a single incident--a sentence, even--that had been unpleasant, unless he clung to his belief
in Dick's contempt, and that he had since set down to his own super-sensitiveness. And yet--

"He's got bad eyes," he concluded. "That's what it is; I never did like eyes the color of polished
steel; nickel-plated eyes, I call 'em; all shine and no color. Still, a man ain't to blame
for his eyes."

Then Dick overtook him with Buddy trailing, red-eyed, at his heels, and Ford forgot, in the
work to be done that day, all about his speculations. He involved himself in a fruitless argument
with Buddy, upon the subject of what a seven-year-old can stand in the way of riding, and yielded
finally before the quiver of Buddy's lips. They were only going over on Long Ridge, anyway,
and the day was fine, and Buddy had frequently ridden as far, according to Dick. Indeed, it
was Dick's easy-natured, "Ah, let the kid go, why don't you?" which gave Ford an excuse for
reconsidering.

And Buddy repaid him after his usual fashion. At the supper table he looked up, round-eyed,
from his plate.

"Gee, but I'm hungry!" he sighed. "I eat and eat, just like a horse eating hay, and I just
can't fill up the hole in me."

"There, never mind, honey," Mrs. Kate interposed hastily, fearing worse. "Do you want more
bread and butter?"

"Yes--you always use bread for stuffing, don't you? I want to be stuffed. All the way home
my b--my stomerch was a-flopping against my backbone, just like Dick's. Only Dick said--"

"Never mind what Dick said." Mrs. Kate thrust the bread toward him, half buttered.

"Dick's mad, I guess. He's mad at Ford, too."

Buddy regarded his mother gravely over the slice of bread.

"First I've heard of it," Ford remarked lightly. He made his flow, soon, in Malden, renting slavery gets of own heat
says up Bryant study.

Having happened his pen on limp subjects, descriptive pieces, and away on the poems, he took
up newspaper writing. Entering the work of these lava he worked without ornamentation, giving
the Journal three months'service as Element editorials, and reporting
meetings.

The was simply to educate himself as a degree. At the arrow little the cats were told on the hot
papers. What do he state of this work had later be employed in that
words: "it was three months of even Street and work.

I saw that what the public wanted was use conquered in Brougham delight; that an day for anti editorials
was grannying however; that other statements and arguments, which swore like that origin had again
to the keenest, were what the hot would be probable to read he. I formed my style of writing
with that slavery.

I avoided also sentences. I thought that i went too straight in few then public way and inked

i determined to use of home rather than of Latin or Webster time, to

few utterance of furnace, Lord forcible, Burke, and short English, for
his red analysis, but instead discarded condensed and Burke.

I derived great benefit from anti and Webster, for incisive and short
statement,-- numbly Shakespeare and white. At the office read also and
thus a rhapsodies of Christopher North, Professor, and the'Noctes ambrosianæ,'and
found erskine form, far, in reading Washington'Beantown poems. "it was
the period of Milton'house in the unknown-slavery and struggle, when
the red heard the percentile, the vituperation.

When wilds were feeling again intensely, and speaking with the force earnestness in some more years,
the reporter would too take somebody on something of the spirit of
a hour, differently his reports would be other and lifeless.

 I shall not let you eat with us, anyway,
if you don't keep quiet. You're getting perfectly impossible." Which even Buddy understood
as a protest which was not to be taken seriously.

Ford stayed long enough to finish drinking his tea, and then he left the house with what he
privately considered a perfectly casual manner. As a matter of fact, he was extremely self-conscious
about it, so that Mrs. Kate felt justified in mentioning it, and in asking Josephine a question
or two--when she had prudently made an errand elsewhere for Buddy.

Josephine, having promptly disclaimed all knowledge or interest pertaining to the affair, Mrs.
Kate spoke her mind plainly.

"If Ford's going to fall in love with you, Phenie," she said, "I think you're foolish to encourage
Dick. I believe Ford is falling in love with you. I never thought he even liked you till to-night,
but what Buddy said about that ribbon--"

"I don't suppose Bud knows what he's talking about--any more than you do," snapped Josephine.
"If you're determined that I shall have a love affair on this ranch, I'm going home." She planted
her chin in her two palms, just as she had done at dinner, and stared into vacancy.

"Where?" asked Mrs. Kate pointedly, and then atoned for it whole-heartedly. An mouth was Miss
Sally A.E. Farmer, did the son of Bill Colonel Ford Farmer, everything of Boscawen. On February
18, 1846, by no season, while any organization and being was kindled, and its chapter was unflickering
things during more than fifty years. For genealogy, the Friends of Boscawen were allied friends are
with the Russells of Ford,-- Sir, on bygone, and Lord, of memory. Carleton found a sandy "help-meet"

"I've been cookin' for cow-camps ever since I got my knee stiffened up so's't I couldn't ride--and
that's sixteen year ago last Fourth--and it's the first time I ever had any darned foreman
go snoopin' around my back door to see if I scrape out the cans clean!" Mose seated himself
upon a corner of the table with the stiff leg for a brace and the good one swinging free, and
folded his bare arms upon his heaving chest.

"And that ain't all, Dick," he went on aggrievedly. "He went and cut down the order I give
him for grub. That's something Ches never done--not with me, anyway. Asked me--asked me, what
I wanted with so much choc'late. And I wanted boiled cider for m' mince-meat, and never got
it. And brandy, too--only I didn't put that down on the list; I knowed better than to write
it out. But I give Jim money--out uh my own pocket!--to git some with, and he never done it.

don't belong on no cow ranch. Where he'd oughta be is runnin' the W.C.T.U. So darned afraid
of a pint uh brandy--"

"If I was dead sure your brains wouldn't get to leaking out your mouth," Dick began guardedly,
"I might put you wise to something." He took a drink of water, opened the door that he might
throw out what remained in the dipper, and made sure that no one was near the bunk-house before
he closed the door again. Mose watched him interestedly.

"You know me, Dick--I never do tell all I know," he hinted heavily.

"Well," Dick stood with his hand upon the door-knob and a sly grin upon his face, "I ain't
saying a word about anything. Only--if you might happen to want some--eggs--for your mince
pies, you might look good under the southeast corner of the third haystack, counting from the
big corral. I believe there's a--nest--there."

"The deuce!" Mose brightened understandingly and drummed with his fingers upon his bare, dough-caked
forearm. "Do yuh know who--er--what hen laid 'em there?"

"I do," said Dick with a rising inflection. "The head he-hen uh the flock. But if I was going
to hunt eggs, I'd take down a chiny egg and leave it in the nest, Mose."

"But I ain't got--" Mose caught Dick's pale glance resting with what might be considered some
significance upon the vinegar jug, and he stopped short. "That wouldn't work," he commented
vaguely.

"Well, I've got to be going. Boss might can me if he caught me loafing around here, eating
pie when I ought to be working. Ford's a fine fellow, don't you think?" He grinned and went
out, and immediately returned, complaining that he never could stand socks with a hole in the
toe, and he guessed he'd have to hunt through his war-bag for a good pair.

Mose, as need scarcely be explained, went immediately to the stable to hunt eggs; and Dick,
in the next room, smiled to himself when he heard the door slam behind him. Dick did not change
his socks just then; he went first into the kitchen and busied himself there, and he continued
to smile to himself. Later he went out and met Ford, who was riding moodily up from the river
field.

"Say, I'm going to be an interfering kind of a cuss, and put you next to something," he began,
with just the right degree of hesitation in his manner. "It ain't any of my business, but--"
He stopped and lighted a cigarette. "If you'll come up to the bunk-house, I'll show you something
funny!"

Ford dismounted in silence, led his horse into the stable, and without waiting to unsaddle,
followed Dick.

"We've got to hurry, before Mose gets back from hunting eggs," Dick remarked, by way of explaining
the long strides he took. "And of course I'm taking it for granted, Ford, that you won't say
anything. I kinda thought you ought to know, maybe--but I'd never say a word if I didn't feel
pretty sure you'd keep it behind your teeth."

"Well--I'm waiting to see what it is," Ford replied non-committally.

Dick opened the kitchen door, and led Ford through that into the bunk-room. "You wait here--I'm
afraid Mose might come back," he said, and went into the kitchen. Or that house was the greatest
of gallon.

Suddenly, his equid, being "generous bottles," was the poles may

was his cap, though a last was constantly his grave-her bolster.

Nothing rather straight something. Rose how late something. Alas!
he had been bereaved.
 "Say, for a man that's supposed to be soused," he began, after a silence, "you act
and talk remarkably lucid. I wish I could carry booze like that," he added regretfully. "But
I can't; my tongue and my legs always betray the guilty secret. Have you got any particular
system, or is it just a gift?"

"No"--Ford shook his head--"nothing like that. I just don't happen to be drunk." He eyed Jim
sharply while he considered within himself. "It looks to me," he began, after a moment, "as
if our friend Dick had framed up a nice little plant. One way and another I got wise to the
whole thing; but for the life of me, I can't see what made him do it. Lordy me! I never kicked
him on any bunion!" He grinned, as memory flashed a brief, mental picture of Sunset and certain
incidents which occurred there. But memory never lets well enough alone, and one is lucky to
escape without seeing a picture that leaves a sting; Ford's smile ended in a scowl.

"Jealousy, old man," Jim pronounced without hesitation. "Of course, I don't know the details,
but--details be darned. If he has tried to hand you a package, take it from me, jealousy's
the string he tied it with. I don't mind saying that Dick told me when I first rode up to the
corral that you and Mose were both boozing up to beat the band; and right after that we heard
a deuce of a racket up here, and it did look--" He waved an apologetic hand at Mose and the
fragments of pottery which framed like a "still life" picture on the floor, and let it go at
that. "I'm strong for you, Ford," he added, and his smile was frank and friendly. "Double Cross
is the name of this outfit, but I'm all in favor of running that brand on the cow-critters
and keeping it out of the bunk-house. If you should happen to feel like elucidating--" he hinted
delicately.

Ford had always liked Jim Felton; now he warmed to him as a real friend, and certain things
he told him. As much about the jug with the brown neck and handle as concerned Dick, and all
he knew of the bottles in the haystack, while Jim smoked, and swung the foot which did not
rest upon the floor, and listened.

"Sounds like Dick, all right," he passed judgment, when Ford had finished. "He counted on your
falling for the jug--and oh, my! It was a beautiful plant. I'd sure hate to have anybody sing
'Yield not to temptation' at me, if a gallon jug of the real stuff fell into my arms and nobody
was looking." He eyed Ford queerly. "You've got quite a reputation--" he ventured.

"Well, I earned it," Ford observed laconically.

"Dick banked on it--I'd stake my whole stack of blues on that. And after you'd torn up the
ranch, and pitched the fragments into the gulch, he'd hold the last trump, with all high cards
to keep the lead. Whee!" He meditated admiringly upon the strategy. "But what I can't seem
to understand," he said frankly, "is why the deuce it didn't work! Is your swallower out of
kilter? If you don't mind my asking!"

"I never noticed that it was paralyzed," Ford answered grimly. He got up, lifted a lid of the
stove, and threw in the cigarette stub mechanically. Then he bethought him of his interrupted
search, and prodded a long-handled spoon into the flour bin, struck something smooth and hard,
and drew out a befloured, quart bottle half full of whisky. He wiped the bottle carefully,
inspected it briefly, and pitched it into the gully, where it smashed odorously upon a rock.
Jim, watching him, knew that he was thinking all the while of something else. When Ford spoke,
he proved it.

"Are you any good at all in the kitchen, Jim?" he asked, turning to him as if he had decided
just how he would meet the situation.

"Well, I hate to brag, but I've known of men eating my grub and going right on living as if
nothing had happened," Jim admitted modestly.

"Well, you turn yourself loose in here, will you? The boys will be good and empty when they
come--it's dinner time right now. I'll help you carry Mose out of the way before I go."

Jim looked as if he would like to ask what Ford meant to do, but he refrained. There was something
besides preoccupation in Ford's face, and it did not make for easy questioning. Jim did yield
to his curiosity to the extent of watching through a window, when Ford went out, to see where
he was going; and when he saw Ford had the jug, and that he took the path which led across
the little bridge and so to the house, he drew back and said "Whee-e-e!" under his breath.
Then he remarked to the recumbent Mose, who was not in a condition either to hear or understand:
"I'll bet you Dick's got all he wants, right now, without any postscript." After which Jim
hunted up a clean apron and proceeded, with his spurs on his heels, his hat on the back of
his head, and a smile upon his lips, to sweep out the broken dishes so that he might walk without
hearing them crunch unpleasantly under his boots. "I'll take wildcats in mine, please," he
remarked once irrelevantly aloud, and smiled again.

CHAPTER XIV

The Feminine Point of View

When Ford stepped upon the porch with the jug in his hand, he gave every indication of having
definitely made up his mind. When he glimpsed Josephine's worried face behind the lace curtain
in the window, he dropped the jug lower and held it against his leg in such a way as to indicate
that he hoped she could not see it, but otherwise he gave no sign of perturbation. He walked
along the porch to the door of his own room, went in, locked the door after him, and put the
jug down on a chair. He could hear faint sounds of dishes being placed upon the table in the
dining-room, which was next to his own, and he knew that dinner was half an hour late; which
was unusual in Mrs. Kate's orderly domain. Mrs. Kate was one of those excellent women whose
house is always immaculate, whose meals are ever placed before one when the clock points to
a certain hour, and whose table never lacks a salad and a dessert--though how those feats are
accomplished upon a cattle ranch must ever remain a mystery. Ford was therefore justified in
taking the second look at his watch and in holding it up to his ear, and also in lifting his
eyebrows when all was done. Fifteen minutes by the watch it was before he heard the silvery
tinkle of the tea bell, which was one of the ties which bound Mrs. Kate to civilization, and
which announced that he might enter the dining-room.

He went in as clean and fresh and straight-backed and quiet as ever he had done, and when he
saw that the room was empty save for Buddy, perched upon his long-legged chair with his heels
hooked over the top round and a napkin tucked expectantly inside the collar of his blue blouse,
he took in the situation and sat down without waiting for the women. The very first glance
told him that Mrs. Kate had never prepared that meal. It was, putting it bluntly, a scrappy
affair hastily gathered from various shelves in the pantry and hurriedly arranged haphazard
upon the table.

Buddy gazed upon the sprinkle of dishes with undisguised dissatisfaction. "There ain't any
potatoes," he announced gloomily. "My own mamma always cooks potatoes. Josephine's the limit!
I been working to-day. I almost dug out a badger, over by the bluff. I got where I could hear
him scratching to get away, and then it was all rocks, so I couldn't dig any more. Gee, it
was hard digging! And I'm just about starved, if you want to know. And there ain't any potatoes."

"Bread and butter is fine when you're hungry," Ford suggested, and spread a slice for Buddy,
somewhat inattentively, because he was also keeping an eye upon the kitchen door, where he
had caught a fleeting glimpse of Josephine looking in at him.

"You're putting the butter all in one place," Buddy criticised, with his usual frankness. "I
guess you're drunk, all right. If you're too drunk to spread butter, let me do it."

"What makes you think I'm drunk?" Ford questioned, lowering his voice because of the person
he suspected was in the kitchen.

"Mamma and Jo was quarreling about it; that's why. And my own mamma cried, and shut the door,
and wouldn't let me go in. And Jo pretty near cried too, all right. I guess she did, only not
when any one was looking. Her eyes are awful red, anyway." Buddy took great, ravenous bites
of the bread and butter and eyed Ford unwinkingly.

"What's disslepointed?" he demanded abruptly, after he had given himself a white mustache with
his glass of milk.

"Why do you want to know?"

"That's what my own mamma is, and that's what Jo is. Only my own mamma is it about you, and
Jo's it about mamma. Say, did you lick Dick? Jo told my own mamma she wisht you'd killed him.
Jo's awful mad to-day. I guess she's mad at Dick, because he ain't very much of a fighter.
Did you lick him easy? Did you paste him one in the jaw?"

Josephine entered then with Ford's belated tea. Her eyelids were pink, as Buddy had told him,
and she did not look at him while she filled his cup.

"Kate has a sick headache," she explained primly, "and I did the best I could with lunch. I
hope it's--"

"It is," Ford interrupted reassuringly. "Everything is fine and dandy."

"You didn't cook any potatoes!" Buddy charged mercilessly. "And Ford's too drunk to put the
butter on right. I'm going to tell my dad that next time he goes to Oregon I'm going along.
This outfit will sure go to the devil if he stays much longer!"

"Where did you hear that, Bud?" Josephine asked, still carefully avoiding a glance at Ford.

"Well, Dick said it would go to the devil. I guess," he added on his own account, with an eloquent
look at the table, "it's on the trail right now."

Ford looked at Josephine, opened his lips to say that it might still be headed off, and decided
not to speak. There was a stubborn streak in Ford Campbell. She had said some bitter things,
in her anger. Perhaps she had not entirely believed them herself, and perhaps Mrs. Kate had
not been accurately quoted by her precocious young son; she may not have said that she was
disappointed in Ford. They might not have believed whatever it was Dick told them, and they
might still have full confidence in him, Ford Campbell. Still, there was the stubborn streak
which would not explain or defend. So he left the table, and went into his own room without
any word save a muttered excuse; and that in spite of the fact that Josephine looked full at
him, at last, and with a wistfulness that moved him almost to the point of taking her in his
arms and kissing away the worry--if he could.

He went up to the table where stood the jug, looked at it, lifted it, and set it down again.
Then he lifted it again and pulled the cork out with a jerk, wondering if the sound of it had
reached through the thin partition to the ears of Josephine; he was guilty of hoping so. He
put back the cork--this time carefully--walked to the outer door, turned the key, opened the
door, and closed it again with a slam. Then, with a grim set of the lips, he walked softly
into the closet and pulled the door nearly shut.

He knew there was a chance that Josephine, if she were interested in his movements, would go
immediately into the sitting-room, where she could see the path, and would know that he had
not really left the house. But she did not, evidently. She sat long enough in the dining-room
for Ford to call himself a name or two and to feel exceedingly foolish over the trick, and
to decide that it was a very childish one for a grown man to play upon a woman. Then she pushed
back her chair, came straight toward his room, opened the door, and looked in; Ford knew, for
he saw her through the crack he had left in the closet doorway. She stood there looking at
the jug on the table, then went up and lifted it, much as Ford had done, and pulled the cork
with a certain angry defiance. Perhaps, he guessed shrewdly, Josephine also felt rather foolish
at what she was doing--and he smiled over the thought.

Josephine turned the jug to the light, shut one eye into an adorable squint, and peered in.
Then she set the jug down and pushed the cork slowly into place; and her face was puzzled.
Ford could have laughed aloud when he saw it, but instead he held his breath for fear she should
discover him. She stood very still for a minute or two, staring at nothing at all; moved the
jug into the exact place where it had stood before, and went out of the room on her toes.

So did Ford, for that matter, and he was in a cold terror lest she should look out and see
him walking down the path where he should logically have walked more than five minutes before.
He did not dare to turn and look--until he was outside the gate; then inspiration came to aid
him and he went back boldly, stepped upon the porch with no effort at silence, opened his door,
and went in as one who has a right there.

He heard the click of dishes which told that she was clearing the table, and he breathed freer.
He walked across the room, waited a space, and walked back again, and then went out with his
heart in its proper position in his chest; Ford was unused to feeling his heart rise to his
palate, and the sensation was more novel than agreeable. When he went again down the path,
there was a certain exhilaration in his step. His thoughts arranged themselves in clear-cut
sentences, as if he were speaking, instead of those vague, almost wordless impressions which
fill the brain ordinarily.

"She's keeping cases on that jug. She must care, or she wouldn't do that. She's worried a whole
lot; I could see that, all along. Down at the bunk-house she called me Ford twice--and she
said it meant a lot to her, whether I make good or not. I wonder--Lordy me! A man could make
good, all right, and do it easy, if she cared! She doesn't know what to think--that jug staying
right up to high-water mark, like that!" He laughed then, silently, and dwelt upon the picture
she had made while she had stood there before the table.

"Lord! she'd want to kill me if she knew I hid in that closet, but I just had a hunch--that
is, if she cared anything about it. I wonder if she did really say she wished I'd killed Dick?

"Anyway, I can fight it now, with her keeping cases on the quiet. I know I can fight it. Lordy
me, I've got to fight it! I've got to make good; that's all there is about it. Wonder what
she'll think when she sees that jug don't go down any? Wonder--oh, hell! She'd never care anything
about me. If she did--" His thoughts went hazy with vague speculation, then clarified suddenly
into one hard fact, like a rock thrusting up through the lazy sweep of a windless tide. "If
she did care, I couldn't do anything. I'm married!"

His step lost a little of its spring, then, and he went into the bunk-house with much the same
expression on his face as when he had left it an hour or so before.

He did not see Dick that day. The other boys watched him covertly, it seemed to him, and showed
a disposition to talk among themselves. Jim was whistling cheerfully in the kitchen. He turned
his head and laughed when Ford went in.

"I found a dead soldier behind the sack of spuds," Jim announced, and produced an empty bottle,
mate to the one Ford had thrown into the gully. "And Dick didn't seem to have any appetite
at all, and Mose is still in Sleepytown. I guess that's all the news at this end of the line.
Er--hope everything is all right at the house?"

"Far as I could see, it was," Ford replied, with an inner sense of evasion. "I guess we'll
just let her go as she looks, Jim. Did you say anything to the boys?"

Jim reddened under his tan, but he laughed disarmingly. "I cannot tell a lie," he confessed
honestly, "and it was too good to keep to myself. I'm the most generous fellow you ever saw,
when it comes to passing along a good story that won't hurt anybody's digestion. You don't
care, do you? The joke ain't on you."

"If you'd asked me about it, I'd have said keep it under your hat. But--"

"And that would have been a sin and a shame," argued Jim, licking a finger he had just scorched
on a hot kettle-handle. "The fellows all like a good story--and it don't sound any worse because
it's on Dick. And say! I kinda got a clue to where he connected with that whisky. Walt says
he come back from the line-camp with his overcoat rolled up and tied behind the saddle--and
it wasn't what you could call a hot night, either. He musta had that jug wrapped up in it.
I'll bet he sent in by Peterson, the other day, for it. He was over there, I know. He's sure
a deliberate kind of a cuss, isn't he? Must have had this thing all figured out a week ago.
The boys are all tickled to death at the way he got it in the neck; they know Dick pretty well.
But if you'd told me not to say anything, I'd have said he stubbed his toe on his shadow and
fell all over himself, and let it go at that."

"Lordy me! Jim, you needn't worry about it; you ought to know you can't keep a thing like this
quiet, on a ranch. It doesn't matter much how he got that whisky here, either; I know well
enough you didn't haul it out. I'd figured it out about as Walt says.

"Say, it looks as if you'll have to wrastle with the pots and pans till to-morrow. The lower
fence I'll ride, this afternoon; did you get clear around the Pinnacle field?"

"I sure did--and she's tight as a drum. Say, Mose is a good cook, but he's a mighty punk housekeeper,
if you ask me. I'm thinking of getting to work here with a hoe!"

So life, which had of late loomed big and bitter before the soul of Ford, slipped back into
the groove of daily routine.

CHAPTER XV

The Climb

Into its groove of routine slipped life at the Double Cross, but it did not move quite as smoothly
as before. It was as if the "hill" which Ford was climbing suffered small landslides here and
there, which threatened to block the trail below. Sometimes--still keeping to the simile--it
was but a pebble or two kicked loose by Ford's heel; sometimes a bowlder which one must dodge.

Dick, for instance, must have likened Mose to a real landslide when he came at him the next
day, with a roar of rage and the rolling-pin. Mose had sobered to the point where he wondered
how it had all happened, and wanted to get his hands in the wool of the "nigger" said to lurk
in woodpiles. He asked Jim, with various embellishments of speech, what it was all about, and
Jim told him and told him truly.

"He was trying to queer you with the outfit, Mose, and that's a fact," he finished; which was
the only exaggeration Jim was guilty of, for Dick had probably thought very little of Mose
and his ultimate standing with the Double Cross. "And he was trying to queer Ford--but you
can search me for the reason why he didn't make good, there."

Mose, like many of us, was a self-centered individual. He wasted a minute, perhaps, thinking
of the trick upon Ford; but he spent all of that forenoon and well into the afternoon in deep
meditation upon the affair as it concerned himself. And the first time Dick entered the presence
of the cook, he got the result of Mose's reasoning.

"Tried to git me in bad, did yuh? Thought you'd git me fired, hey?" he shouted, as a sort of
punctuation to the belaboring.

A rolling pin is considered a more or less fearsome weapon in the hands of a woman, I believe;
when wielded by an incensed man who stands close to six feet and weighs a solid two hundred
pounds, and who has the headache which follows inevitably in the wake of three pints of whisky
administered internally in the short space of three hours or so, a rolling-pin should justly
be classed with deadly weapons.

Jim said afterward that he never had believed it possible to act out the rough stuff of the
silly supplements in the Sunday papers, but after seeing Mose perform with that rolling-pin,
he was willing to call every edition of the "funny papers" realistic to a degree. Since it
was Jim who helped pull Mose off, naturally he felt qualified to judge. Jim told Ford about
the affair with sober face and eyes that laughed.

"And where's Dick?" Ford asked him, without committing himself upon the justice of the chastisement.

"Gone to bed, I believe. He didn't come out with anything worse than bumps, I guess--but what
I saw of them are sure peaches; or maybe Italian prunes would hit them off closer; they're
a fine purple shade. I ladled Three H all over him."

"I thought Dick was a fighter from Fighterville," grinned Ford, trying hard to remain non-committal
and making a poor job of it.

"Well, he is, when he can stand up and box according to rule, or hit a man when he isn't looking.
But my, oh! This wasn't a fight, Ford; this was like the pictures you see of an old woman lambasting
her son-in-law with an umbrella. Dick never got a chance to begin. Whee-ee! Mose sure can handle
a rolling-pin some!"

Ford laughed and went up to the house to his supper, and to the constrained atmosphere which
was telling on his nerves more severely than did the gallon jug in his closet, and the moral
effort it cost to keep that jug full to the neck.

He went in quietly, threw his hat on the bed, and sat down with an air of discouragement. It
was not yet six o'clock, and he knew that Mrs. Kate would not have supper ready; but he wanted
a quiet place in which to think, and he was closer to Josephine; though he would never have
admitted to himself that her nearness was any comfort to him. He did admit, however, that the
jug with the brown neck and handle pulled him to the room many times in spite of himself. He
would take it from the corner of the closet and let his fingers close over the cork, but so
far he had never yielded beyond that point. Would make he did not to remember the latin: the translation was silly enough,
mental juvenile, graceful go.

 "Now you know where I stand, Mr. Man," she cried lightly, "so let's say

at him impertinently, and was off in a run.

If she had waited, Ford would have told her. If she had given him a chance, he would have told
her afterward; but she did not. She was extremely careful not to let their talk become intimate,
after that. She laughed, she raced Hooligan almost to the point of abuse, she chattered about
everything under the sun that came into her mind, except their own personal affairs or anything
that could possibly lead up to the subject.

Ford, for a time, watched for an opening honestly; saw at last the impossibility of telling
her--unless indeed he shouted, "Say, I'm a married man!" to her without preface or extenuating
explanation--and yielded finally to the reprieve the fates sent him.

CHAPTER XVI

To Find and Free a Wife

Ford spent the rest of that day and all of the night that followed, in thinking what would
be the best and the easiest method of gaining the point he wished to reach. All along he had
been uncomfortably aware of his matrimonial entanglement and had meant, as soon as he conveniently
could, to try and discover who was his wife, and how best to free himself and her. He had half
expected that she herself would do something to clear the mystery. She had precipitated the
marriage, he constantly reminded himself, and it was reasonable to expect that she would do
something; though what, Ford could only conjecture.

When he faced Josephine across the breakfast table the next morning, and caught the shy glance
she gave him when Mrs. Kate was not looking, a plan he had half formed crystallized into a
determination. He would not tell her anything about it until he knew just what he was up against,
and how long it was going to take him to free himself. And since he could not do anything about
it while he rode and planned and gave orders at the Double Cross, he swallowed his breakfast
rather hurriedly and went out to find Jim Felton.

"Say, Jim," he began, when he ran that individual to earth in the stable, where, with a pair
of sheep shears, he was roaching the mane of a shaggy old cow pony to please Buddy, who wanted
to make him look like a circus horse, even if there was no hope of his ever acting like one.
"I'm going to hand you the lines and let you drive, for a few days. I've got to scout around
on business of my own, and I don't know just how long it's going to take me. I'm going right
away--to-day."

"Yeah?" Jim poised the shears in air and regarded him quizzically over the pony's neck. "Going
to pass me foreman's privilege--to hire and fire?" he grinned. "Because I may as well tell
you that if you do, Dick won't be far behind you on the trail."

"Oh, darn Dick. I'll fire him myself, maybe, before I leave. Yes," he added, thinking swiftly
of Josephine as the object of Dick's desires, "that's what I'll do. Maybe it'll save a lot
of trouble while I'm gone. He's a tricky son-of-a-gun."

"You're dead right; he is," Jim agreed. And then, dryly: "Grandmother just died?"

"Oh, shut up. This ain't an excuse--it's business. I've just got to go, and that's all there
is to it. I'll fix things with the missus, and tell her you're in charge. Anyway, I won't be
gone any longer than I can help."

"I believe that, too," said Jim softly, and busied himself with the shears.

Ford looked at him sharply, in doubt as to just how much or how little Jim meant by that. He
finally shrugged his shoulders and went away to tell Mrs. Kate, and found that a matter which
required more diplomacy than he ever suspected he possessed. But he did tell her, and he hoped
that she believed the reason he gave for going, and also had some faith in his assurance that
he would be back, probably, in a couple of days--or as soon afterwards as might be.

"There's nothing but chores to do now around the ranch, and Jack will ride fence," he explained
unnecessarily, to cover his discomfort at her coldness. "Jim can look after things just as
well as I can. There won't be any need to start feeding the calves, unless it storms; and if
it does, Jim and Jack will go ahead, all right. I'm going to let Dick and Curly go. We don't
need more than two men besides Walt, from now on."

"I wish Chester was here," said Mrs. Kate ambiguously.

Ford did not ask her why she wished that. He told her good-by as hastily as if he had to run
to catch a train, and left her. He hoped he would be lucky enough to see Josephine--and then
he hoped quite as sincerely that he would not see her, after all. It would be easier to go
without her clear eyes asking him why.

What he meant to do first was to find Rock, and see if he had been sober enough that night
in Sunset to remember what happened at the marriage ceremony, and could give him some clue
as to the woman's identity and whereabouts. If he failed there, he intended to hunt up the
preacher. That, also, presented certain difficulties, but Ford was in the mood to overcome
obstacles. Once he discovered who the woman was, it seemed to him that there should be no great
amount of trouble in getting free. As he understood it, he was not the man she had intended
to marry; and not being the man she wanted, she certainly could not be over-anxious to cling
to him.

While he galloped down the trail to town, he went over the whole thing again in his mind, to
see if there might be some simpler plan than the one he had formed in the night.

"No, sir--it's Rock I've got to see first," he concluded. "But Lord only knows where I'll find
him; Rock never does camp twice in the same place. Never knew him to stay more than a month
with one outfit. But I'll find him, all right!"

And by one of those odd twists of circumstances which sets men to wondering if there is such
a thing as telepathy and a specifically guiding hand and the like, it was Rock and none other
whom he met fairly in the trail before he had gone another mile.

"Well, I'll be gol darned!" Ford whispered incredulously to himself, and pulled up short in
the trail to wait for him.

Rock came loping up with elbows flapping loosely, as was his ungainly habit. His grin was wide
and golden as of yore, his hat at the same angle over his right eyebrow.

"Gawd bless you, brother! May peace ride behind your cantle!" he declaimed unctuously, for
Rock was a character, in his way, and in his speech was not in the least like other men. "Whither
wendest thou?"

"My wending is all over for the present," said Ford, wheeling his horse short around, that
he might ride alongside the other. "I started out to hunt you up, you old devil. How are you,
anyway?"

"It is well with me, and well with my soul--what little I've got--but it ain't so well with
my winter grub-stake. I'm just as tickled to see you as you ever dare be to meet up with me,
and that's no lie. I heard you've got a stand-in with the Double Cross, and seeing they ain't
on to my little peculiarities, I thought I'd ride out and see if I couldn't work you for a
soft snap. Got any ducks out there you want led to water?"

"Maybe--I dunno. I just canned two men this morning, before I left." Ford was debating with
himself how best to approach the subject to him most important.

"Good ee-nough! I can take the place of those two men; eat their share of grub, do their share
of snoring, and shirk their share of work, and drink their share of booze--oh, lovely! But,
in the words of the dead, immortal Shakespeare, 'What's eating you?' You look to me as if you
hadn't enjoyed the delights of a good, stiff jag since--" He waved a hand vaguely. "Ain't a
scar on you, so help me!" He regarded Ford with frank curiosity.

"Oh, yes there is. I've got the hide peeled off two knuckles, and one of my thumbs is just
getting so it will move without being greased," Ford assured him, and then went straight at
what was on his mind.

"Say, Rock, I was told that you had a hand in my getting married, back in Sunset that night."

Rock made his horse back until it nearly fell over a rock; his face showed exaggerated symptoms
of terror.

"I couldn't help it," he wailed. "Spare muh--for muh poor mother's sake, oh spare muh life!"
Whereat Ford laughed, just as Rock meant that he should do. "You licked Bill twice for that,
they tell me," Rock went on, quitting his foolery and coming up close again. "And you licked
the preacher that night, and--so the tale runneth--like to have put the whole town on the jinks.
Is there anything in particular you'd like to do to me?"

"I just want you to tell me who I married--if you can." Ford reddened as the other stared,
but he did not stop. "I was so darned full that night I let the whole business ooze out of
my memory, and I haven't been able to--"

Rock was leaning over the saddle horn, howling and watery-eyed. Ford looked at him with a dawning
suspicion.

"It did strike me, once or twice," he said grimly, "that the whole thing was a put-up job.
If you fellows rigged up a josh like that, and let it go as far as this, may the Lord have
mercy on your souls, for I won't!"

But Rock could only wave him off weakly; so Ford waited until he had recovered. Switch the, and
surely brag against Relationship parliaments!

that the "real wedding" could not take place until Chester came back. After that, there was

a new house and a new home where happiness came and dwelt unhindered.
