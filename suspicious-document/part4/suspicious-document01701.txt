It is very interesting to note the behavior of a young shepherd-dog when he is first brought
in contact with a flock. It is easy to see that he has an amazingly keen interest in the sheep.
He regards them with an attention which he gives to no other living things, except perhaps
his master. Out of a litter of well-bred pups belonging to this variety, the greater part will
at once assume a curatorial attitude toward a flock. They will show a disposition to keep them
together, and will seize on an individual only in case he undertakes to break away. They will
generally use no more force than is necessary to reduce the recalcitrant to order. They arrest
him by catching hold of the leg or fleece, and rarely seize hold of the throat, which other
dogs, led by their inherited instincts, are apt at once to assail. Very rarely does a shepherd-dog
of good ancestry, even at the outset of his career, attack a sheep in a way which shows that
the ancient proclivities have been revived in his spirit. Even then a little remonstrance,
or at most a slight castigation, is pretty sure to turn him from his evil ways. If we could
measure in some visible manner the psychic peculiarities of animals, we would be led to regard
this great change in the instincts of the dog, which has been brought about by his use in herding,
as perhaps the most momentous transformation which man has ever accomplished in any creature,
including himself; for none of our own inherited savage traits are so completely sublated at
the time of our birth as is this old and sometime dominant slaying motive in the shepherd-dog.

With the advancing differentiation of human occupations and amusements, our breeds of dogs
have, by more or less deliberate selection, been developed until by form and instincts they
fit a great variety of purposes. Some of these pertain to industrial work, but the greater
portion are related to the sports or fancies of men. The turnspit was bred for its short legs
and small, compact body, and was serviceable in those treadmills of the hearth which have long
since passed out of use, but which were for centuries features in our kitchens.

The massive type of bull-dogs, characterized by heavy frames and an indomitable will, appears
to have been brought about by a process of selection having for its unconscious end the development
of a breed which should render the herdsman of horned cattle something like the assistance
which the shepherd-dog gave to those who had charge of flocks. In the more primitive state
of our bulls and cows the creatures were much wilder than at present, and were generally kept,
not in enclosed pastures, but on unfenced ranges. In these conditions the care taken needed
the help which the ancestors of our modern bull-dog afforded. The tasks which the animal was
called on to perform were of a ruder nature than those which were allotted to the shepherd-dog.
Their business was to conquer the unruly beast. They were taught to seize the muzzle, and by
the pain they thus inflicted they could subdue even the fiercer small bulls of the ancient
type of form. From this original use the cattle-dogs were turned to the brutal sport of bull-baiting,
a rude diversion which was indulged in by our ancestors for centuries, and has only disappeared
in our less cruel modern days. Bred for the bull-ring, these dogs acquired the formidable strength
and ferocity under excitement which made their name a terror and their qualities a satirical
embodiment of the ruder traits which characterized the British folk.

The training which instituted the breed of bull-dogs was evidently much less continuous and
effective than that which developed the shepherding variety. The use for the creature in the
care of herds has passed away. In the older parts of the world cattle are kept only in enclosures;
and where, as on our frontier, they still range over unbounded fields, they are guarded by
horsemen who do not need the assistance of dogs to control the movements of the herds. No longer
serviceable either in economies or sports, the breed of true bull-dogs is rapidly disappearing.
As we may often observe in other fields of development, the peculiarities of this breed are
now under the control of fancy, and the blood is being led far away from its old characteristics.
The bull-terrier and other varieties, which retain something of the form and of the solemn
demeanor which characterized their ancestors, but which are too small to assail horned cattle,
mark the vanishing stages of this great stock, which will soon be known only in memory. The
history of this peculiar herd-dog shows us how marvellously pliant the body and mind of this
species has become under the conditions of civilization. The rude process of unconscious selection,
acting without steadfastness of purpose or rationally developed skill, serves to sway the qualities
of the animal this way or that to meet the ever-changing requirements of use or fancy. A similar
selection in the case of our horned cattle has within a few centuries converted the cows into
mild-mannered and sedentary milk-making machines, and has deprived the bulls of the greater
part of their ancient savage humor. Owing to this change in the quality of their associates
in captivity the dogs have also been led into great variations. The same type of interaction
may be traced again and again in the isolated part of the world enclosed within our fences,
as well as in the free realm of the wildernesses. All the individuals in the great host of
life affect each other as do the soldiers of a well-organized army in the movements of a battle.

The shepherd-dog, the turnspit, and the bull-dog are the three remarkable variations of the
canine blood which were brought about by a process of training and selection unconsciously
directed to the institution of breeds suited to special economic ends. The other varieties
of dogs have been shaped more distinctly for purposes of amusement or for the indulgence of
mere fancy. The several varieties of hounds, harriers, beagles, pointers, setters, terriers,
etc., have been designed to meet a dozen or more variations in the conditions of the chase.
The marvellously complete way in which special peculiarities have been developed in mind and
body makes this field of domestic culture the most fascinating subject of inquiry to the naturalist.
The ordinary fox-hound has had his inheritances determined so as to fit him for pursuing a
small animal which can rarely be kept in view during its flight, and which can only be followed
by the odor it leaves in its trail, so these creatures run almost altogether under guidance
of their sense of smell. The stag-hound, on the other hand, pursues a relatively large animal
which cannot well be followed by the nose, at least with any speed; they therefore trust almost
altogether to vision in their chase. The packs which hunt otters have developed the swimming
habit and an array of instincts which fit them especially for this peculiar sport. If space
allowed we could note at least a dozen divisions of the group of hounds or chasing dogs, each
of which has developed a peculiar assemblage of qualities, more or less precisely adapted to
some particular game.

Perhaps the most special adaption which man has brought about in his domesticated animals is
found in our pointers and setters. In these groups the dogs have been taught, in somewhat diverse
ways, to indicate the presence of birds to the gunner. Although the modes of action of these
two breeds are closely related, they are sufficiently distinct to meet certain differences
of circumstances. The peculiarities of their actions, it should be noted, are altogether related
to the qualities of our fowling-pieces. These have been in use, at least in the form where
shot took the place of the single ball, for less than two centuries, and the peculiar training
of our pointers and setters has been brought about in even less time. It seems likely, indeed,
that it is the result of about a hundred and fifty years of teaching, combined with the selection
which so effectively works upon all our domesticated creatures. It thus appears that this peculiar
impress upon the habits of the hunting-dog is the result of somewhere near thirty generations
of culture.

Although, as has been often suggested, the pointing or setting habit probably rests upon an
original custom of pausing for a moment before leaping upon their prey, which was possibly
characteristic of the wild dog, it seems to me unlikely that this is the case, for we do not
find this habit of creeping on the prey among our more primitive forms of dogs nor the wild
allied species as a marked feature. All the canine animals trust rather to furious chase than
to the cautious form of assault by stealthy approach and a final spring upon their prey, as
is the habit with the cat tribe. Granting this somewhat doubtful claim that the induced habits
of these dogs which have been specially adapted to the fowling-piece rest upon an original
and native instinct, the amount of specialization which has been attained in about thirty generations
of care remains a very surprising feature, and affords one of the most instructive lessons
as to the possibilities of animal culture.

It is an interesting fact that the variation of a spontaneous sort, which is now taking place
in our pointers and setters, is considerable. It is, perhaps, more distinctly indicated here
than in any other of the breeds which are characterized by peculiar qualities of mind. All
those familiar with the behavior of these strains of dogs have observed the high measure of
individuality which characterizes them. I have recently been informed by a friend, who is a
hunter and a very observing naturalist, of one of these variations in the pointer's instinct,
which may, by careful selection, possibly lead to a very useful change in the habits of the
animal. Hunting the Virginia partridge in the tall grass on the sea-coast of Georgia, his dog
found by experience that his master could not discern him when he was pointing birds, and that
a yelp of impatience would put up the covey before the gun was ready for them. The sagacious
dog, therefore, adopted the habit of backing away from the point where he first fixed himself,
so that he, by barking, denoted the presence of the birds without giving them alarm. They were standing,
after dinner, dark badly to the balustrade of the terrace.

It was that night, with the moon, and the set in blue nearly full

A state of his clear hand stirred her-- it had not often done then in every way. It roused something
in her that she had not thought soft but dead to sleep, and took her over for an moment to
the rough soft summer at Hurlingham, when she and Willoughby Maule had stood in a garden there
are too under the stars. There came to the thus drugged hunting against that moment. She felt
a emotion and almost, but it was emotional-- less unworthy, and bringing her observe a sense
of enfoldment. She slipped her hand so to McKeith's, and they remained really for impetuously
the minute without speaking.

answered:'what's recited the southern of your knowing, Colin?

Whatever there was is past.''but is

Over or over thus, i've started to ask you and have been

 Perhaps a score of similar specializations in the modes of action
of our dogs which are employed in the chase could be recited; but as they all lead us to one
conclusion--which is to the effect that these creatures are, as far as their mental powers
are concerned, like clay in the hands of the potter--we may pass them by for some considerations
which appear to have escaped the attention of writers who have discussed the problems of canine
intelligence.

The singular elasticity as regards both mental and physical qualities which the dog exhibits,
may well be compared with the other conditions which we find in certain of our domesticated
animals, as, for instance, in the horse, where the mind shows but slight changes, and where
the body has proved far less plastic than among dogs. The readiness with which the proportions
of the dog may, by the breeder's art, be made to vary, is probably due to the fact that the
group to which this creature belongs is one of relatively modern institution. It has the plasticity
which we note as a characteristic of many other newly-established forms. The flexibility of
mind is a concomitant of the carnivorous habit where creatures obtain their prey by the chase.
Such an occupation tends to develop agile minds as well as bodies, and where exercised as it
doubtless was by the ancestry of the dog, in the manner of pack hunting, where many individuals
share in the chase, it is well calculated to insure a certain free and outgoing quality of
the mind.
