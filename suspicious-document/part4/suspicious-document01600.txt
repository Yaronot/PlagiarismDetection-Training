239. Individuality.--Material difference in digestive power is noticeable among individuals.
Digestion experiments show that one person may digest 5 per cent more of a nutrient than another.
This difference appears to be due to a number of factors, as activity of the organs, as affected
by exercise and kind of labor performed; abnormal composition of the digestive fluids; or failure
of the different parts of the digestive tract to act in harmony. Individuality is one of the
most important factors in digestion. Persons become accustomed to certain foods through long
usage, and the digestive tract adapts itself to those foods, rendering sudden and extreme changes
in the dietary hazardous. Common food articles may fail to properly digest in the case of some
individuals, while with others they are consumed with benefit. What is food to one may prove
to be a poison to another, and while general statements can be made in regard to the digestibility
of foods, individual differences must be recognized.

240. Psychological Factors.--Previously conceived ideas concerning foods influence digestibility.
Foods must be consumed with a relish in order to secure the best results, as flow of the digestive
fluids and activity of the organs are to a certain extent dependent upon the nerve centers.
If it is believed that a food is poisonous or injurious, even when the food is wholesome, normal
digestion fails to take place. In experiments by the author, in which the comparative digestibility
of butter and oleomargarine was being studied, it was found that when the subjects were told
they were eating oleomargarine, its digestibility was depressed 5 per cent, and when they were
not told the nature of the material, but assumed that butter was oleomargarine, the digestibility
of the butter was lowered about 6 per cent.[13] Preconceived notions in regard to foods, not
founded upon well-established facts, but due to prejudice resulting from ignorance, cause many
valuable foods to be excluded from the dietary. Many persons, like the foreign lady who, visiting
this country, said she ate only acquaintances, prefer foods that have a familiar taste and
appearance, and any unusual taste or appearance detracts from the value because of the psychological
influence upon digestion.

CHAPTER XVI

COMPARATIVE COST AND VALUE OF FOODS

241. Cost and Nutrient Content of Foods.--The market price and the nutritive value of foods
are often at variance, as those which cost the most frequently contain the least nutrients.[75]
It is difficult to make absolute comparisons as to the nutritive value of foods at different
prices, because they differ not only in the amounts, but also in the kinds of nutrients. While
it is not possible to express definitely the value of one food in terms of another, approximate
comparisons may be made as to the amounts of nutrients that can be secured for a given sum
of money when foods are at different prices, and tables have been prepared making such comparisons.

242. Nutrients Procurable for a Given Sum.[7]--To ascertain the nutrients procurable for a
given sum first determine the amount in pounds that can be obtained, say, for ten cents, and
then multiply by the percentages of fat, protein, carbohydrates, and calories in the food.
The results are the amounts, in pounds, of nutrients procurable for that sum of money. For
example: if milk is 5 cents per quart, two quarts or approximately four pounds, can be procured
for 10 cents. If the milk contains fat, 4 per cent, protein, 3.3 per cent, carbohydrates, 5
per cent, and fuel value, 310 calories per pound, multiplying each of these by 4 gives the
nutrients and fuel value in four pounds, or 10 cents worth of milk, as follows:

  Protein             0.13 lb.
  Fat                 0.16 lb.
  Carbohydrates       0.2 lb.
  Calories            1240

If it is desired to compare milk at 5 cents per quart with round steak at 15 cents per pound,
10 cents will procure 0.66, or two thirds of a pound of round steak containing on an average
(edible portion) 19 per cent protein, 12.8 per cent fat, and yielding 890 calories per pound.
If 10 per cent is refuse, there is edible about 0.6 of a pound. The amounts of nutrients in
the 0.6 of a pound of steak, edible portion, or 0.66 lb. as purchased would be:

  Protein          0.11 lb.
  Fat              0.08 lb.
  Calories          534

It is to be observed that from the 10 cents' worth of milk a little more protein, 0.08 of a
pound more fat, and nearly two and one half times as many calories can be secured as from the
10 cents' worth of meat. This is due to the carbohydrates and the larger amount of fat which
the milk contains. At these prices, milk should be used liberally in the dietary, as it furnishes
more of all the nutrients than does meat. It would not be advisable to exclude meat entirely
from the ration, but milk at 5 cents per quart is cheaper food than meat at 15 cents per pound.
In making comparisons, preference cannot always be given to one food because of its containing
more of any particular nutrient, for often there are other factors that influence the value.

243. Comparing Foods as to Nutritive Value.--In general, preference should be given to foods
which supply the most protein, provided the differences between the carbohydrates and fats
are not large. When the protein content of two foods is nearly the same, but the fats and carbohydrates
differ materially, the preference may safely be given to the food which supplies the larger
amount of total nutrients. A pound of protein in a ration is more valuable than a pound of
either fat or carbohydrates, although it is not possible to establish an absolute scale as
to the comparative value of these nutrients, because they serve different functional purposes
in the body. It is sometimes necessary to use small amounts of foods rich in protein in order
to secure a balanced ration; excessive use of protein, however, is not economical, as that
which is not needed for functional purposes is converted into heat and energy which could be
supplied as well by the carbohydrates, and they are less expensive nutrients.

  =============================================================================

It is to be noted in the table that, ordinarily, for the same amount of money the most nutrients
can be obtained in the form of milk, cheese, sugar, and beans, corn meal, wheat flour, oatmeal,
and cereals in bulk. While meats supply protein liberally, they fail to furnish carbohydrates
as the vegetables. As discussed in the chapter on Dietary Studies of Families, unnecessarily
expensive foods are often used, resulting either in lack of nutrients or unbalanced rations.

EXAMPLES

1. Compute the calories and the amounts of protein, fat, and carbohydrates that can be procured
for 25 cents in cheese selling for 18 cents per pound; how do these compare with the nutrients
in eggs at 20 cents per dozen?

2. Which food furnishes the larger amount of nutrients, potatoes at 50 cents per bushel or
flour at $6 per barrel?

3. How do beans at 10 cents per quart compare in nutritive value with beef at 15 Cents per pound?

4. How does salt codfish at 10 cents per pound compare in nutritive value with lamb chops at
15 cents per pound?

5. Compare in nutritive value cream at 25 cents per quart with butter at 30 cents per pound.

6. Calculate the composition and nutritive value of a cake made of sugar, 8 oz.; butter, 4
oz.; eggs, 8 oz.; flour, 8 oz.; and milk, 4 oz.; the baked cake weighs one and three fourths
pounds.
