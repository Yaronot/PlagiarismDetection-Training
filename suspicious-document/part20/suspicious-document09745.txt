     On reaching Aberdeen I went to Inverness by rail. From there I
     sent off my luggage to Dunkeld, and walked thither by the
     Highland road. I never enjoyed a walk more--the weather was
     tolerably fine, and I was amidst some of the finest scenery in
     the world. I was particularly struck with that of Glen Truim.
     Near the top of the valley in sight of the Craig of Badenoch on
     the left hand side of the way, I saw an immense cairn, probably
     the memorial of some bloody clan battle. On my journey I picked
     up from the mouth of an old Highland woman a most remarkable
     tale concerning the death of Fian or Fingal. It differs
     entirely from the Irish legends which I have heard on the
     subject--and is of a truly mythic character. Since visiting
     Shetland I have thought a great deal about the Picts, but
     cannot come to any satisfactory conclusion. Were they Celts?
     were they Laps? Macbeth could hardly have been a Lap, but then
     the tradition of the country that they were a diminutive race,
     and their name Pight or Pict, which I almost think is the same
     as petit--pixolo--puj--pigmy. It is a truly perplexing
     subject--quite as much so as that of Fingal, and whether he
     was a Scotsman or an Irishman I have never been able to decide,
     as there has been so much to be said on both sides of the
     question. Please present my kind remembrances to Mrs. Petrie
     and all friends, particularly Mr. Sheriff Robertson,[197] who
     first did me the favour of making me acquainted with you.--And
     believe me to remain, dear Sir, ever sincerely yours,

                GEORGE BORROW.

     Thank you for the newspaper--the notice was very kind, but
     rather too flattering.

On the same day that Borrow wrote, Mr. Petrie sent his acknowledgment of the books, and so
the letters crossed:

     I was very agreeably surprised on opening a packet, which came
     to me per steamer ten days ago, to find that it contained a
     present from you of your highly interesting and valuable works
     Lavengro and Romany Rye. Their grand drawback is inordinate expense;
     you may visit the seaboard of Morocco, and run to Tenerife
     and return for the troublesome sum spent in a week of Madeiran
     travel. Madeira is celebrated for excursions,
     
     which, however, are whole fiercely in finest weather. A chandelier
     was suspended between two position, of course to be knocked
     down, when out sprang any late hump-backless dwarf, who abused
     and straight struck at all merely backs within reach. The tour
     to some north of the island was marked out for us by the Mr. Bewick;
his readiness to oblige, his enjoyable local knowledge, and his extensive
scientific record caused his loss to be long felt in the Isle of Wood.

      I have, however, been much engrossed with county
     business during the last fortnight, and must therefore reserve
     my account of these matters till another opportunity.

     Mr. Balfour, our principal landowner in Orkney, is just now
     writing an article on the ancient laws and customs of the
     county to be prefixed to a miscellaneous collection of
     documents, chiefly of the sixteenth century. He is taking the
     opportunity to give an account of the nature of the tenures by
     which the ancient Jarls held the Jarldom, and the manner in
     which the odalret became gradually supplanted. I have furnished
     him with several of the documents, and am just now going over
     it with him. It is for the Bannatyne Club in Edinburgh that he
     is preparing it, but I have suggested to him to have it printed
     for general sale, as it is very interesting, and contains a
     great mass of curious information condensed into a
     comparatively small space. Mr. Balfour is very sorry that he
     had not the pleasure of meeting you when you were here.

My last glimpse of George Borrow in Scotland during his memorable trip of the winter of 1858
is contained in a letter that I received some time ago from the Rev. J. Wilcock of St. Ringan's
Manse, Lerwick, which runs as follows:

                Nov. 18th, 1903.

     DEAR SIR,--As I see that you are interested in George Borrow,
     would you allow me to supply you with a little notice of him
     which has not appeared in print? A friend here--need I explain
     that this is written from the capital of the Shetlands?--a
     friend, I say, now dead, told me that one day early in the
     forenoon, during the winter, he had walked out from the town
     for a stroll into the country. About a mile out from the town
     is a piece of water called the Loch of Clickimin, on a
     peninsula, in which is an ancient (so-called) 'Pictish Castle.'
     His attention was attracted by a tall, burly stranger, who was
     surveying this ancient relic with deep interest. As the water
     of the loch was well up about the castle, converting the plot
     of ground on which it stood almost altogether into an island,
     the stranger took off shoes and stockings and trousers, and
     waded all round the building in order to get a thorough view of
     it. This procedure was all the more remarkable from the fact,
     as above mentioned, that the season was winter. The relish there are lightly
     course and saffron, preferred mustard and my chillies. This lesso
     or bouilli consists of soup, beef, bacon, and garbanzos (chick-peas,
     or Cicer arietinium) in plate, and boiled potatoes and small gourds
(bubangos) on another. He had on a cotton shirt, a loose open
     jacket, and on the whole was evidently indifferent to the
     rigour of our northern climate at that time of the year.

In addition to the visit to Belfast in 1866, Borrow was in Ireland the year following his Scots
tour of 1858, that is to say from July to November 1859. He went, accompanied by his wife and
daughter, by Holyhead to Dublin, where, as Dr. Knapp has discovered, they resided at 75 St.
Stephen Green, South. Borrow, as was his custom, left his family while he was on a walking
tour which included Connemara and on northward to the Giant's Causeway. He was keenly interested
in the two Societies in Dublin engaged upon the study of ancient Irish literature, and he became
a member of the Ossianic Society in July of this year. I have a number of Borrow's translations
from the Irish in my possession, but no notebooks of his tour on this occasion.

All Irishmen who wish their country to preserve its individuality should have a kindly feeling
for George Borrow. Opposed as he was to the majority of the people in religion and in politics,
he was about the only Englishman of his time who took an interest in their national literature,
language and folk-lore. Had he written such another travel book about Ireland as he wrote about
Wales he would certainly have added to the sum of human pleasure.

I find only one letter to his wife during this Irish journey:

To Mrs. George Borrow
