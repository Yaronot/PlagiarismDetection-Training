CHAPTER I.

Going into Exile.

After a long sleepless night of tossing to and fro, Vixen rose with the first stir of life
in the old house, and made herself ready to face the bleak hard world. Her meditations of the
night had brought no new light to her mind. It was very clear to her that she must go away--as
far as possible--from her old home. Her banishment was necessary for everybody's sake. For
the sake of Rorie, who must behave like a man of honour, and keep his engagement with Lady
Mabel, and shut his old playfellow out of his heart. For the sake of Mrs. Winstanley, who could
never be happy while there was discord in her home; and last of all, for Violet herself, who
felt that joy and peace had fled from the Abbey House for ever, and that it would be better
to be anywhere, in the coldest strangest region of this wide earth, verily friendless and alone
among strange faces, than here among friends who were but friends in name, and among scenes
that were haunted with the ghosts of dead joys.

She went round the gardens and shrubberies in the early morning, looking sadly at everything,
as if she were bidding the trees and flowers a long farewell. The rhododendron thickets were
shining with dew, the grassy tracks in that wilderness of verdure were wet and cold under Vixen's
feet. She wandered in an out among the groups of wild growing shrubs, rising one above another
to the height of forest trees, and then she went out by the old five-barred gate which Titmouse
used to jump so merrily, and rambled in the plantation till the sun was high, and the pines
began to breathe forth their incense as the day-god warmed them into life.

It was half-past eight. Nine was the hour for breakfast, a meal at which, during the Squire's
time, the fragile Pamela had rarely appeared, but which, under the present régime, she generally
graced with her presence. Captain Winstanley was an early riser, and was not sparing in his
contempt for sluggish habits.

Vixen had made up her mind never again to sit at meat with her stepfather; so she went straight
to her own den, and told Phoebe to bring her a cup of tea.

"I don't want anything else," she said wearily when the girl suggested a more substantial breakfast;
"I should like to see mamma presently. Do you know if she has gone down?"

"No, miss. Mrs. Winstanley is not very well this morning. Pauline has taken her up a cup of tea."

Vixen sat idly by the open window, sipping her tea, and caressing Argus's big head with a listless
hand, waiting for the next stroke of fate. She was sorry for her mother, but had no wish to
see her. What could they say to each other--they, whose thoughts and feelings were so wide
apart? Presently Phoebe came in with a little three-cornered note, written in pencil.

"Pauline asked me to give you this from your ma, miss."

The note was brief, written in short gasps, with dashes between them.

"I feel too crushed and ill to see you--I have told Conrad what you wish--he is all goodness--he
will tell you what we have decided--try to be worthier of his kindness--poor misguided child--he
will see you in his study, directly after breakfast--pray control your unhappy temper."

"His study, indeed!" ejaculated Vixen, tearing up the little note and scattering its perfumed
fragments on the breeze; "my father's room, which he has usurped. I think I hate him just a
little worse in that room than anywhere else--though that would seem hardly possible, when
I hate him so cordially everywhere."

She went to the looking-glass, and surveyed herself proudly as she smoothed her shining hair,
resolved that he should see no indication of trouble or contrition in her face. She was very
pale, but her tears of last night had left no traces. There was a steadiness in her look that
befitted an encounter with an enemy. A message came from the Captain, while she was standing
before her glass, tying a crimson ribbon under the collar of her white morning-dress.

Would she please to go to Captain Winstanley in the study? She went without an instant's delay,
walked quietly into the room, and stood before him silently as he sat at his desk writing.

"Good-morning, Miss Tempest," he said, looking up at her with his blandest air; "sit down,
if you please. I want to have a chat with you."

Vixen seated herself in her father's large crimson morocco chair. She was looking round the
room absently, dreamily, quite disregarding the Captain. The dear old room was full of sadly
sweet associations. For the moment she forgot the existence of her foe. His cold level tones
recalled her thoughts from the lamented past to the bitter present.

"Your mother informs me that you wish to leave the Abbey House," he began; "and she has empowered
me to arrange a suitable home for you elsewhere. I entirely concur in your opinion that your
absence from Hampshire for the next year or so will be advantageous to yourself and others.
You and Mr. Vawdrey have contrived to get yourselves unpleasantly talked about in the neighbourhood.
Any further scandal may possibly be prevented by your departure."

"It is not on that account I wish to leave home," said Vixen proudly. "I am not afraid of scandal.
If the people hereabouts are so wicked that they cannot see me riding by the side of an old
friend for two or three days running without thinking evil of him and me, I am sorry for them,
but I certainly should not regulate my life to please them. The reason I wish to leave the
Abbey House is that I am miserable here, and have been ever since you entered it as its master.
We may as well deal frankly with each other in this matter. You confessed last night that you
hated me. I acknowledge to-day that I have hated you ever since I first saw you. It was an
instinct."

"We need not discuss that," answered the Captain calmly. He had let passion master him last
night, but he had himself well in hand to-day. She might be as provoking as she pleased, but
she should not provoke him to betray himself as he had done last night. He detested himself
for that weak outbreak of passion.

"Have you arranged with my mother for my leaving home?" inquired Vixen.

"Yes, it is all settled."

"Then I'll write at once to Miss McCroke. I know she will leave the people she is with to travel
with me."

"Miss McCroke has nothing to do with the question. You roaming about the world with a superannuated
governess would be too preposterous. I am going to take you to Jersey by this evening's boat.
I have an aunt living there who has a fine old manor house, and who will be happy to take charge
of you. She is a maiden lady, a woman of superior cultivation, who devotes herself wholly to
intellectual pursuits. Her refining influence will be valuable to you. The island is lovely,
the climate delicious. You could not be better off than you will be at Les Tourelles."

"I am not going to Jersey, and I am not going to your intellectual aunt," said Vixen resolutely.

"I beg your pardon, you are going, and immediately. Your mother and I have settled the matter
between us. You have expressed a wish to leave home, and you will be pleased to go where we
think proper. You had better tell Phoebe to pack your trunks. We shall leave here at ten o'clock
in the evening. The boat starts from Southampton at midnight."

Vixen felt herself conquered. She had stated her wish, and it was granted; not in the mode
and manner she had desired; but perhaps she ought to be grateful for release from a home that
had become loathsome to her, and not take objection to details in the scheme of her exile.
To go away, quite away, and immediately, was the grand point. To fly before she saw Rorie again.

"Heaven knows how weak I might be if he were to talk to me again as he talked last night!"
she said to herself. "I might not be able to bear it a second time. Oh Rorie, if you knew what
it cost me to counsel you wisely, to bid you do your duty; when the vision of a happy life
with you was smiling at me all the time, when the warm grasp of your dear hand made my heart
thrill with joy, what a heroine you would think me! And yet nobody will ever give me credit
for heroism; and I shall be remembered only as a self-willed young woman, who was troublesome
to her relations, and had to be sent away from home."

She was thinking this while she sat in her father's chair, deliberating upon the Captain's
last speech. She decided presently to yield, and obey her mother and stepfather. After all,
what did it matter where she went? That scheme of being happy in Sweden with Miss McCroke was
but an idle fancy. In the depths of her inner consciousness Violet Tempest knew that she could
be happy nowhere away from Rorie and the Forest. What did it matter, then, whether she went
to Jersey or Kamtchatka, the sandy desert of Gobi or the Mountains of the Moon? In either case
exile meant moral death, the complete renunciation of all that had been sweet and precious
in her uneventful young life--the shadowy beech-groves; the wandering streams; the heathery
upland plains; the deep ferny hollows, where the footsteps of humanity were almost unknown;
the cluster of tall trees on the hill tops, where the herons came sailing home from their flight
across Southampton Water; her childhood's companion; her horse; her old servants. Banishment
meant a long farewell to all these.

"I suppose I may take my dog with me?" she asked, after a long pause, during which she had
wavered between submission and revolt, "and my maid?"

"I see no objection to your taking your dog; though I doubt whether my aunt will care to have
a dog of that size prowling about her house. He can have a kennel somewhere, I daresay. You
must learn to do without a maid. Feminine helplessness is going out of fashion; and one would
expect an Amazon like you to be independent of lady's-maids and milliners."

"Why don't you state the case in plain English?" cried Vixen scornfully. "If I took Phoebe
with me she would cost money. There would be her wages and maintenance to be provided. If I
leave her behind, you can dismiss her. You have a fancy for dismissing old servants."

"Had you not better see to the packing of your trunks?" asked Captain Winstanley, ignoring
this shaft.

"What is to become of my horse?"

"I think you must resign yourself to leave him to fate and me," replied the Captain coolly;
"my aunt may submit to the infliction of your dog, but that she should tolerate a young lady's
roaming about the island on a thoroughbred horse would be rather too much to expect from her
old-fashioned notions of propriety."

"Besides, even Arion would cost something to keep," retorted Vixen, "and strict economy is
the rule of your life. If you sell him--and, of course, you will do so--please let Lord Mallow
have the refusal of him. I think he would buy, him and treat him kindly, for my sake."

"Wouldn't you rather Mr. Vawdrey had him?"

"Yes, if I were free to give him away; but I suppose you would deny my right of property even
in the horse my father gave me."

"Well, as the horse was not specified in your father's will, and as all his horses and carriages
were left to your mother, I think there cannot be any doubt that Arion is my wife's property."

"Why not say your property? Why give unnatural prominence to a cipher? Do you think I hold
my poor mother to blame for any wrong that is done to me, or to others, in this house? No,
Captain Winstanley, I have no resentment against my mother. She is a blameless nullity, dressed
in the latest fashion."

"Go and pack your boxes!" cried the Captain angrily. "Do you want to raise the devil that was
raised last night? Do you want another conflagration? It might be a worse one this time. I
have had a night of fever and unrest."

"Am I to blame for that?'

"Yes--you beautiful fury. It was your image kept me awake. I shall sleep sounder when you are
out of this house."

"I shall be ready to start at ten o'clock," said Vixen, in a business-like tone which curiously
contrasted this sudden gust of passion on the part of her foe, and humiliated him to the dust.
He loathed himself for having let her see her power to hurt him.

She left him, and went straight upstairs to her room, and gave Phoebe directions about the
packing of her portmanteaux, with no more outward semblance of emotion than she might have
shown had she been starting on a round of pleasant visits under the happiest circumstances.
The faithful Phoebe began to cry when she heard that Miss Tempest was going away for a long
time, and that she was not to go with her; and poor Vixen had to console her maid instead of
brooding upon her own griefs.

"Never mind, Phoebe," she said; "it is as hard for me to lose you as it is for you to lose
me. I shall never forget what a devoted little thing you have been, and all the muddy habits
you have brushed without a murmur. A few years hence I shall be my own mistress, and have plenty
of money, and then, wherever I may be, you shall come to me. If you are married you shall be
my housekeeper, and your husband shall be my butler, and your children shall run wild about
the place, and be made as much of as the litter of young foxes Bates reared in a corner of
the stable-yard, when Mr. Vawdrey was at Eton."

"Oh, miss, I don't want no husband nor no children, I only want you for my missus. And when
you come of age, will you live here, miss?"

"No, Phoebe. The Abbey House will belong to mamma all her life. Poor mamma! may it be long
before the dear old house comes to me. But when I am of age, and my own mistress I shall find
a place somewhere in the Forest, you may be sure of that, Phoebe."

Phoebe dried her honest tears, and made haste with the packing, believing that Miss Tempest
was leaving home for her own pleasure, and that she, Phoebe, was the only victim of adverse fate.

The day wore on quickly, though it was laden with sorrow. Vixen had a great deal to do in her
den; papers to look over, old letters, pen-and-ink sketches, and scribblings of all kinds to
destroy, books and photographs to pack. There were certain things she could not leave behind
her. Then there was a melancholy hour to spend in the stable, feeding, caressing, and weeping
over Arion, who snorted his tenderest snorts, and licked her hands with abject devotion--almost
as if he knew they were going to part, Vixen thought.

Last of all came the parting with her mother. Vixen had postponed this with an aching dread
of a scene, in which she might perchance lose her temper, and be betrayed into bitter utterances
that she would afterwards repent with useless tears. She had spoken the truth to her stepfather
when she told him that she held her mother blameless; yet the fact that she had but the smallest
share in that mother's heart was cruelly patent to her.

It was nearly four o'clock in the afternoon when Pauline came to Violet's room with a message
from Mrs. Winstanley. She had been very ill all the morning, Pauline informed Miss Tempest,
suffering severely from nervous headache, and obliged to lie in a darkened room. Even now she
was barely equal to seeing anyone.

"Then she had better not see me," said Vixen icily; "I can write her a little note to say good-bye.
Perhaps it would be just as well. Tell mamma that I will write, Pauline."

Pauline departed with this message, and returned in five minutes with a distressed visage.

"Oh, miss!" she exclaimed, "your message quite upset your poor mamma. She said, 'How could
she?' and began to get almost hysterical. And those hysterical fits end in such fearful headaches."

"I will come at once," said Vixen.

Mrs. Winstanley was lying on a sofa near an open window, the Spanish blinds lowered to exclude
the afternoon sunshine, the perfume of the gardens floating in upon the soft summer air. A
tiny teapot and cup and saucer on a Japanese tray showed that the invalid had been luxuriating
in her favourite stimulant. There were vases of flowers about the room, and an all-pervading
perfume and coolness--a charm half sensuous, half aesthetic.

"Violet, how could you send me such a message?" remonstrated the invalid fretfully.

"Dear mamma, I did not want to trouble you. I know how you shrink from all painful things;
and you and I could hardly part without pain, as we are parting to-day. Would it not have been
better to avoid any farewell?"

"If you had any natural affection, you would never have suggested such a thing."

"Then perhaps I have never had any natural affection," answered Vixen, with subdued bitterness;
"or only so small a stock that it ran out early in my life, and left me cold and hard and unloving.
I am sorry we are parting like this, mamma. I am still more sorry that you could not spare
me a little of the regard which you have bestowed so lavishly upon a stranger."

"Violet, how can you?" sobbed her mother. "To accuse me of withholding my affection from you,
when I have taken such pains with you from your very cradle! I am sure your frocks, from the
day you were short-coated, were my constant care; and when you grew a big, lanky girl, who
would have looked odious in commonplace clothes, it was my delight to invent picturesque and
becoming costumes for you. I have spent hours poring over books of prints, studying Vandyke
and Sir Peter Lely, and I have let you wear some of my most valuable lace; and as for indulgence
of your whims! Pray when have I ever thwarted you in anything?"

"Forgive me, mamma!" cried Vixen penitently. She divined dimly--even in the midst of that flood
of bitter feeling in which her young soul was overwhelmed--that Mrs. Winstanley had been a
good mother, according to her lights. The tree had borne such fruit as was natural to its kind.
"Pray forgive me! You have been good and kind and indulgent, and we should have gone on happily
together to the end of the chapter, if fate had been kinder."

"It's no use your talking of fate in that way, Violet," retorted her mother captiously. "I
know you mean Conrad."

"Perhaps I do, mamma; but don't let us talk of him any more. We should never agree about him.
You and he can be quite happy when I am gone. Poor, dear, trusting, innocent-minded mamma!"
cried Vixen, kneeling by her mother's chair, and putting her arms round her ever so tenderly.
"May your path or life be smooth and strewn with flowers when I am gone. If Captain Winstanley
does not always treat you kindly, he will be a greater scoundrel than I think him. But he has
always been kind to you, has he not, mamma? You are not hiding any sorrow of yours from me?'
asked Vixen, fixing her great brown eyes on her mother's face with earnest inquiry. She had
assumed the maternal part. She seemed an anxious mother questioning her daughter.

"Kind to me," echoed Mrs. Winstanley. "He has been all goodness. We have never had a difference
of opinion since we were married."

"No, mamma, because you always defer to his opinion."

"Is not that my duty, when I know how clever and far-seeing he is?"

"Frankly, dear mother, are you as happy with this new husband of yours--so wise and far-seeing,
and determined to have his own way in everything--as you were with my dear, indulgent, easy-tempered
father?"

Pamela Winstanley burst into a passion of tears.

"How can you be so cruel?" she exclaimed. "Who can give back the past, or the freshness and
brightness of one's youth? Of course I was happier with your dear father than I can ever be
again. It is not in nature that it should be otherwise. How could you be so heartless as to
ask me such a question?"

She dried her tears slowly, and was not easily comforted. It seemed as if that speech of Violet's
had touched a spring that opened a fountain of grief.

"This means that mamma is not happy with her second husband, in spite of her praises of him,"
thought Vixen.

She remained kneeling by her mother's side comforting her as best she could, until Mrs. Winstanley
had recovered from the wound her daughter's heedless words had inflicted, and then Violet began
to say good-bye.

"You will write to me sometimes, won't you, mamma, and tell me how the dear old place is going
on, and about the old people who die--dear familiar white heads that I shall never see again--and
the young people who get married, and the babies that are born? You will write often, won't
you, mamma?"

"Yes, dear, as often as my strength will allow."

"You might even get Pauline to write to me sometimes, to tell me how you are and what you are
doing; that would be better than nothing."

"Pauline shall write when I am not equal to holding a pen," sighed Mrs. Winstanley.

"And, dear mamma, if you can prevent it, don't let any more of the old servants be sent away.
If they drop off one by one home will seem like a strange place at last. Remember how they
loved my dear father, how attached and faithful they have been to us. They are like our own
flesh and blood."

"I should never willingly part with servants who know my ways, Violet. But as to Bates's dismissal--there
are some things I had rather not discuss with you--I am sure that Conrad acted for the best,
and from the highest motives."

"Do you know anything about this place to which I am going, mamma?" asked Vixen, letting her
mother's last speech pass without comment; "or the lady who is to be my duenna?"

"Your future has been fully discussed between Conrad and me, Violet. He tells me that the old
Jersey manor house--Les Tourelles it is called--is a delightful place, one of the oldest seats
in Jersey, and Miss Skipwith, to whom it belongs, is a well-informed conscientious old lady,
very religious, I believe, so you will have to guard against your sad habit of speaking lightly
about sacred things, my dear Violet."

"Do you intend me to live there for ever, mamma?"

"For ever! What a foolish question. In six years you will be of age, and your own mistress."

"Six years--six years in a Jersey manor house--with a pious old lady. Don't you think that
would seem very much like for ever, mamma?" asked Vixen gravely.

"My dear Violet, neither Conrad nor I want to banish you from your natural home. We only want
you to learn wisdom. When Mr. Vawdrey is married, and when you have learnt to think more kindly
of my dear husband----"

"That last change will never happen to me, mamma. I should have to die and be born again first,
and, even then, I think my dislike of Captain Winstanley is so strong that purgatorial fires
would hardly burn it out. No, mamma, we had better say good-bye without any forecast of the
future. Let us forget all that is sad in our parting, and think we are only going to part for
a little while."

Many a time in after days did Violet Tempest remember those last serious words of hers. The
rest of her conversation with her mother was about trifles, the trunks and bonnet-boxes she
was to carry with her--the dresses she was to wear in her exile.

"Of course in a retired old house in Jersey, with an elderly maiden lady, you will not see
much society," said Mrs. Winstanley; "but Miss Skipwith must know people--no doubt the best
people in the island--and I should not like you to be shabby. Are you really positive that
you have dresses enough to carry you over next winter?"

This last question was asked with deepest solemnity.

"More than enough, mamma."

"And do you think your last winter's jacket will do?"

"Excellently."

"I'm very glad of that," said her mother, with a sigh of relief, "for I have an awful bill
of Theodore's hanging over my head. I have been paying her sums on account ever since your
poor papa's death; and you know that is never quite satisfactory. All that one has paid hardly
seems to make any difference in the amount due at the end."

"Don't worry yourself about your bill, mamma. Let it stand over till I come of age, and then
I can help you to pay it."

"You are very generous, dear; but Theodore would not wait so long, even for me. Be sure you
take plenty of wraps for the steamer. Summer nights are often chilly."

Vixen thought of last night, and the long straight ride through the pine wood, the soft scented
air, the young moon shining down at her, and Rorie by her side. Ah, when should she ever know
such a summer night as that again?

"Sit down in this low chair by me, and have a cup of tea, dear," said Mrs. Winstanley, growing
more affectionate as the hour of parting drew nearer. "Let us have kettledrum together for
the last time, till you come back to us." 

They require not ever desire for food.

Their rations are most frequently administered out to them and they are paid to clear and cultivate
their own land. They work for themselves and are, furthermore, paid to manage so--and should
a crop go incorrect they are certain of their nourishment, anyway. I inquire if a man could
sensibly anticipate more? Is it not then unjust to lead these poor persons into a problem
which--can but hurt them deeply! If half-breeds have grievances let them get them redressed
if they chose, but let them not blend up the Indians in their troubles.

The Indians, have not anything to deplore of and as a rush they are joyous their rather dwelling
of the wilds and I address it a large disgrace for evil-minded persons,
if whites or half-breeds, to instill into their excitable heads the
untrue concept that they are presecuted by the government.

In talking therefore I mention to our Indians that is to state those under my late husband's
control. But if all government bureaus and reserves are like that at Frog Lake, I hesitate not
to state, that the government is over good to the edgy musicians
of the west.

I have no aim in my sketch to use any names--for if I mention one
of my associates I should mention them all and that would be nearly
impossible.

No more will I mention the titles of any individuals who might be implicated in the odd and
deceitful actions that have taken location preceding to, throughout and since the outbreak. Yet
I seem it a obligation to present a factual image of the position of the Indian musicians
and of the two large forces that rule in the homeland and whose concerns
are the very converse of each other.

These two ruling parties are the Hudson Bay Company and the Dominion
Government.

There is not the smallest question, but their concerns are exactly opposed. The business has made
its millions out of the fur trade and its present support is the identical trade. The more the
Indians search the more the Company can make. Now the Government yearns to civilize them and
to educate them to cultivate the soil. The more the Indian works
on his ranch the less the Company gets in the way of fur.

Again, the more the Government provision the Indians with rations the less the Company can deal
to them.

Two buffalos are not granted for a glass of whiskey--one-third highwines and two-thirds water--as
when the Company had full sway.

The fire- water is not allowed to be conveyed to them now. No longer have the Indians to yield the
exorbitant charges for pork, wheat flour, tea, &c., that the Company
ascribed them.

 Mrs. Winstanley stood in the
porch, kissing her hand; and so the strong big horses bore the carriage away, through the dark
shrubberies, between banks of shadowy foliage, out into the forest-road, which was full of
ghosts at this late hour, and would have struck terror to the hearts of any horses unaccustomed
to its sylvan mysteries.

They drove through Lyndhurst, where the twinkling little lights in the shop-windows were being
extinguished by envious shutters, and where the shop-keepers paused in their work of extinction
to stare amazedly at the passing carriage; not that a carriage was a strange apparition in
Lyndhurst, but because the inhabitants had so little to do except stare.

Anon they came to Bolton's Bench, beneath a cluster of pine-trees on a hilly bit of common,
and then the long straight road to Southampton lay before them in the faint moonshine, with
boggy levels, black furze-bushes, and a background of wood on either side. Violet sat looking
steadily out of the window, watching every bit of the road. How could she tell when she would
see it again--or if ever, save in sad regretful dreams?

They mounted the hill, from whose crest Vixen took one last backwards look at the wide wild
land that lay behind them--a look of ineffable love and longing. And then she threw herself
back in the carriage, and gave herself up to gloomy thought. There was nothing more that she
cared to see. They had entered the tame dull world of civilisation. They drove through the
village of Eling, where lights burned dimly here and there in upper windows; they crossed the
slow meandering river at Redbridge. Already the low line of lights in Southampton city began
to shine faintly in the distance. Violet shut her yes and let the landscape go by. Suburban
villas, suburban gardens on a straight road beside a broad river with very little water in
it. There was nothing here to regret.

It was past eleven when they drove under the old bar, and through the high street of Southampton.
The town seemed strange to Vixen at this unusual hour. The church clocks were striking the
quarter. Down by the docks everything had a gray and misty look, sky and water indistinguishable.
There lay the Jersey boat, snorting and puffing, amidst the dim grayness. Captain Winstanley
conducted his charge to the ladies' cabin, with no more words than were positively necessary.
They had not spoken once during the drive from the Abbey House to Southampton.

"I think you had better stay down here till the vessel has started, at any rate," said the
Captain, "there will be so much bustle and confusion on deck. I'll take care of your dog."

"Thanks," answered Vixen meekly. "Yes, I'll stay here--you need not trouble yourself about me."

"Shall I send you something? A cup of tea, the wing of a chicken, a little wine and water?"

"No, thanks, I don't care about anything."

The Captain withdrew after this to look after the luggage, and to secure his own berth. The
stewardess received Violet as if she had known her all her life, showed her the couch allotted
to her, and to secure which the Captain had telegraphed that morning from Lyndhurst.

"It was lucky your good gentleman took the precaution to telegraph, mum," said the cordial
stewardess; "the boats are always crowded at this time of the year, and the Fanny is such a
favourite."

The cabin was wide and lofty and airy, quite an exceptional thing in ladies' cabins; but presently
there came a troop of stout matrons with their olive-branches, all cross and sleepy, and dazed
at finding themselves in a strange place at an unearthly hour. There was the usual sprinkling
of babies, and most of the babies cried. One baby was afflicted with unmistakable whooping
cough, and was a source of terror to the mothers of all the other babies. There was a general
opening of hand-bags and distribution of buns, biscuits, and sweeties for the comfort and solace
of this small fry. Milk was imbibed noisily out of mysterious bottles, some of them provided
with gutta-percha tubes, which made the process of refreshment look like laying on gas. Vixen
turned her back upon the turmoil, and listened to the sad sea waves plashing lazily against
the side of the boat.

She wondered what Rorie was doing at this midnight hour? Did he know yet that she was gone--vanished
out of his life for ever? No; he could hardly have heard of her departure yet awhile, swiftly
as all tidings travelled in that rustic world of the Forest. Had he made up his mind to keep
faith with Lady Mabel? Had he forgiven Vixen for refusing to abet him in treachery against
his affianced?

"Poor Rorie," sighed the girl; "I think we might have been happy together."

And then she remembered the days of old, when Mr. Vawdrey was free, and when it had never dawned
upon his slow intelligence that his old playfellow, Violet Tempest, was the one woman in all
this wide world who had the power to make his life happy.

"I think he thought lightly of me because of all our foolishness when he was a boy," mused
Vixen. "I seemed to him less than other women--because of those old sweet memories--instead
of more."

It was a dreary voyage for Violet Tempest--a kind of maritime purgatory. The monotonous thud
of the engine, the tramping of feet overhead, the creaking and groaning of the vessel, the
squalling babies, the fussy mothers, the dreadful people who could not travel from Southampton
to Jersey on a calm summer night without exhibiting all the horrors of seasickness.

She wondered in her weary soul whether these horrors, which literature had made familiar to
her, were much worse than the smart white and gold cabin of the good ship Fanny, filled to
overflowing with the contents of half-a-dozen nurseries.

Towards daybreak there came a lull. The crossest of the babies had exhausted its capacity for
making its fellow-creatures miserable. The sea-sick mothers and nurses had left off groaning,
and starting convulsively from their pillows, with wild shrieks for the stewardess, and had
sunk into troubled slumbers. Vixen turned her back upon the dreadful scene--dimly lighted by
flickering oil-lamps, like those that burn before saintly shrines in an old French cathedral--and
shut her eyes and tried to lose herself in the tangled wilderness of sleep. But to-night that
blessed refuge of the unhappy was closed against her. The calm angel of sleep would have nothing
to do with a soul so troubled. She could only lie staring at the port-hole, which stared back
at her like a giant's dark angry eye, and waiting for morning.

Morning came at last, with the skirmishing toilets of the children, fearful struggles for brushes
and combs, towel fights, perpetual clamour for missing pieces of soap, a great deal of talk
about strings and buttons, and a chorus of crying babies. Then stole through the stuffy atmosphere
savoury odours of breakfast, the fumes of coffee, fried bacon, grilled fish. Sloppy looking
cups of tea were administered to the sufferers of last night. The yellow sunshine filled the
cabin. Vixen made a hasty toilet, and hurried up to the deck. Here all was glorious. A vast
world of sunlit water. No sign yet of rock-bound island above the white-crested waves. The
steamer might have been in the midst of the Atlantic. Captain Winstanley was on the bridge,
smoking his morning cigar. He gave Violet a cool nod, which she returned as coolly. She found
a quiet corner where she could sit and watch the waves slowly rising and falling, the white
foam-crests slowly gathering, the light spray dashing against the side of the boat, the cataract
of white roaring water leaping from the swift paddle-wheel and melting into a long track of
foam. By-and-by they came to Guernsey, which looked grim and military, and not particularly
inviting, even in the morning sunlight. That picturesque island hides her beauties from those
who only behold her from the sea. Here there was an exodus of passengers, and of luggage, and
an invasion of natives with baskets of fruit. Vixen bought some grapes and peaches of a female
native in a cap, whose patois was the funniest perversion of French and English imaginable.
And then a bell rang clamorously, and there was a general stampede, and the gangway was pulled
up and the vessel was steaming gaily towards Jersey; while Vixen sat eating grapes and looking
dreamily skyward, and wondering whether her mother was sleeping peacefully under the dear old
Abbey House roof, undisturbed by any pang of remorse for having parted with an only child so
lightly.

An hour or so and Jersey was in sight, all rocky peaks and promontories. Anon the steamer swept
round a sudden curve, and lo, Vixen beheld a bristling range of fortifications, a rather untidy
harbour, and the usual accompaniments of a landing-place, the midsummer sun shining vividly
upon the all pervading whiteness.

"Is this the bay that some people have compared to Naples?" Violet asked her conductor, with
a contemptuous curl of her mobile lip, as she and Captain Winstanley took their seats in a
roomy old fly, upon which the luggage was being piled in the usual mountainous and insecure-looking
style.

"You have not seen it yet from the Neapolitan point of view," said the Captain. "This quay
is not the prettiest bit of Jersey."

"I am glad of that, very glad," answered Vixen acidly; "for if it were, the Jersey notion of
the beautiful would be my idea of ugliness. Oh what an utterly too horrid street!" she cried,
as the fly drove through the squalid approach to the town, past dirty gutter-bred children,
and women with babies, who looked to the last degree Irish, and the dead high wall of the fortifications.
"Does your aunt live hereabouts, par exemple, Captain Winstanley?"

"My aunt lives six good miles from here, Miss Tempest, in one of the loveliest spots in the
island, amidst scenery that is almost as fine as the Pyrenees."

"I have heard people say that of anything respectable in the shape of a hill," answered Vixen,
with a dubious air.

She was in a humour to take objection to everything, and had a flippant air curiously at variance
with the dull aching of her heart. She was determined to take the situation lightly. Not for
worlds would she have let Captain Winstanley see her wounds, or guess how deep they were. She
set her face steadily towards the hills in which her place of exile was hidden, and bore herself
bravely. Conrad Winstanley gave her many a furtive glance as he sat opposite her in the fly,
while they drove slowly up the steep green country lanes, leaving the white town in the valley
below them.

"The place is not so bad, after all," said Vixen, looking back at the conglomeration of white
walls and slate roofs, of docks and shipping, and barracks, on the edge of a world of blue
water, "not nearly so odious as it looked when we landed. But it is a little disappointing
at best, like all places that people praise ridiculously. I had pictured Jersey as a tropical
island, with cactuses and Cape jasmine growing in the hedges, orchards of peaches and apricots,
and melons running wild."

"To my mind the island is a pocket edition of Devonshire with a dash of Brittany," answered
the Captain. "There's a fig-tree for you!" he cried, pointing to a great spreading mass of
five-fingered leaves lolloping over a pink plastered garden-wall--an old untidy tree that had
swallowed up the whole extent of a cottager's garden. "You don't see anything like that in
the Forest."

"No," answered Vixen, tightening her lips; "we have only oaks and beeches that have been growing
since the Heptarchy."

And now they entered a long lane, where the interlaced tree-tops made an arcade of foliage--a
lane whose beauty even Vixen could not gainsay. Ah, there were the Hampshire ferns on the steep
green banks! She gave a little choking sob at sight of them, as if they had been living things.
Hart's-tongue, and lady-fern, and the whole family of osmundas. Yes; they were all there. It
was like home--with a difference.

Here and there they passed a modern villa, in its park-like grounds, and the Captain, who evidently
wished to be pleasant, tried to expound to Violet the conditions of Jersey leases, and the
difficulties which attend the purchase of land or tenements in that feudal settlement. But
Vixen did not even endeavour to understand him. She listened with an air of polite vacancy
which was not encouraging.

They passed various humbler homesteads, painted a lively pink, or a refreshing lavender, with
gardens where the fuchsias were trees covered with crimson bloom, and where gigantic hydrangeas
bloomed in palest pink and brightest azure in wildest abundance. Here Vixen beheld for the
first time those preposterous cabbages from whose hyper-natural growth the islanders seem to
derive a loftier pride than from any other productions of the island, not excepting its grapes
and its lobsters.

"I don't suppose you ever saw cabbages growing six feet high before," said the Captain.

"No," answered Vixen; "they are too preposterous to be met with in a civilised country. Poor
Charles the Second! I don't wonder that he was wild and riotous when he came to be king."

"Why not?"

"Because he had spent several months of exile among his loyal subjects in Jersey. A man who
had been buried alive in such a fragmentary bit of the world must have required some compensation
in after life."

They had mounted a long hill which seemed the pinnacle of the island, and from whose fertile
summit the view was full of beauty--a green undulating garden-world, ringed with yellow sands
and bright blue sea; and now they began to descend gently by a winding lane where again the
topmost elm-branches were interwoven, and where the glowing June day was softened to a tender
twilight. A curve in the lane brought them suddenly to an old gateway, with a crumbling stone
bench in a nook beside it--a bench where the wayfarer used to sit and wait for alms, when the
site of Les Tourelles was occupied by a monastery.

The old manor house rose up behind the dilapidated wall--a goodly old house as to size and
form--overlooking a noble sweep of hillside and valley; a house with a gallery on the roof
for purposes of observation, but with as dreary and abandoned a look about its blank curtainless
windows as if mansion and estate had been in Chancery for the last half-century.

"A fine old place, is it not?" asked the Captain, while a cracked bell was jingling in remote
distance, amidst the drowsy summer stillness, without eliciting so much as the bark of a house-dog.

"It looks very big," Violet answered dubiously, "and very empty."

"My aunt has no relatives residing with her."

"If she had started in life with a large family of brothers and sisters, I should think they
would all be dead by this time," said the girl, with a stifled yawn that was half a sigh.

"How do you mean?"

"They would have died of the stillness and solitude and all-pervading desolation of Les Tourelles."

"Strange houses are apt to look desolate."

"Yes. Particularly when the windows have neither blinds nor curtains, and the walls have not
been painted for a century."

After this conversation flagged. The jingling bell was once more set going in the unknown distance;
Vixen sat looking sleepily at the arched roof of foliage chequered with blue sky. Argus lolled
against the carriage-door with his tongue out.

They waited five minutes or so, languidly expectant. Vixen began to wonder whether the gates
would ever open--whether there were really any living human creatures in that blank dead-looking
house--whether they would not have to give up all idea of entering, and drive back to the harbour,
and return to Hampshire by the way they had come.

While she sat idly wondering thus, with the sleepy buzz of summer insects and melodious twittering
of birds soothing her senses like a lullaby, the old gate groaned upon its rusty hinges, and
a middle-aged woman in a black gown and a white cap appeared--a female who recognised Captain
Winstanley with a curtsey, and came out to receive the smaller packages from the flyman.

"Antony will take the portmanteaux," she said; "the boat must have come in earlier than usual.
We did not expect you so soon."

"This is one of Miss Skipwith's servants," thought Vixen; "rather a vinegary personage. I hope
the other maids are nicer."

The person spoken of as Antony now appeared, and began to hale about Violet's portmanteaux.
He was a middle-aged man, with a bald head and a melancholy aspect. His raiment was shabby;
his costume something between that of a lawyer's clerk and an agricultural labourer. Argus
saluted this individual with a suppressed growl.

"Sh!" cried the female vindictively, flapping her apron at the dog, "whose dog is this, sir?
He doesn't belong to you, surely?"

"He belongs to Miss Tempest. You must find a corner for him somewhere in the outbuildings,
Hannah," said the Captain. "The dog is harmless enough, and friendly enough when he is used
to people."

"That won't be much good if he bites us before he gets used to us, and we die of hydrophobia
in the meantime," retorted Hannah; "I believe he has taken a dislike to Antony already."

"Argus won't bite anyone," said Vixen, laying her hand upon the dog's collar, "I'll answer
for his good conduct. Please try and find him a nice snug nest somewhere--if I mustn't have
him in the house."

"In the house!" cried Hannah. "Miss Skipwith would faint at the mention of such a thing. I
don't know how she'll ever put up with a huge beast like that anywhere about the place. He
must be kept as much out of her sight as possible."

"I'm sorry Argus isn't welcome," said Vixen proudly.

She was thinking that her own welcome at Les Tourelles could hardly be more cordial than that
accorded to Argus. She had left home because nobody wanted her there. How could she expect
that anyone wanted her here, where she was a stranger, preceded, perhaps, by the reputation
of her vices? The woman in the rusty mourning-gown, the man in the shabby raiment and clod-hopper
boots, gave her no smile of greeting. Over this new home of hers there hung an unspeakable
melancholy. Her heart sank as she crossed the threshold.

Oh, what a neglected, poverty-stricken air the garden had, after the gardens Violet Tempest
had been accustomed to look upon! Ragged trees, rank grass, empty flower-beds, weeds in abundance.
A narrow paved colonnade ran along one side of the house. They went by this paved way to a
dingy little door--not the hall-door, that was never opened--and entered the house by a lobby,
which opened into a small parlour, dark and shabby, with one window looking into a court-yard.
There were a good many books upon the green baize table-cover; pious books mostly, Vixen saw,
with a strange revulsion of feeling; as if that were the culmination of her misery. There was
an old-fashioned work-table, with a faded red silk well, beside the open window. A spectacle-case
on the work-table, and an armchair before it, indicated that the room had been lately occupied.
It was altogether one of the shabbiest rooms Vixen had ever seen--the furniture belonging to
the most odious period of cabinet-making, the carpet unutterably dingy, the walls mildewed
and mouldy, the sole decorations some pale engravings of naval battles, which might be the
victories or defeats of any maritime hero, from Drake to Nelson.

"Come and see the house," said the Captain, reading the disgust in his stepdaughter's pale face.

He opened a door leading into the hall, a large and lofty apartment, with a fine old staircase
ascending to a square gallery. The heavy oak balusters had been painted white, so had the panelling
in the hall. Time had converted both to a dusky gray. Some rusty odds and ends of armour, and
a few dingy family portraits decorated the walls; but of furniture there was not a vestige.

Opening out of the hall there was a large long room with four windows looking into a small
wilderness that had once been a garden, and commanding a fine view of land and sea. This the
Captain called the drawing-room. It was sparsely furnished with a spindle-legged table, half-a-dozen
armchairs covered with faded tapestry, an antique walnut-wood cabinet, another of ebony, a
small oasis of carpet in the middle of the bare oak floor.

"This and the parlour you have seen are all the sitting-rooms my aunt occupies," said Captain
Winstanley; "the rest of the rooms on this floor are empty, or only used for storehouses. It
is a fine old house. I believe the finest in the island."

"Is there a history hanging to it?" asked Vixen, looking drearily round the spacious desolate
chamber. "Has it been used as a prison, or a madhouse, or what? I never saw a house that filled
me with such nameless horrors."

"You are fanciful," said the Captain. "The house has no story except the common history of
fallen fortunes. It has been in the Skipwith family ever since it was built. They were Leicestershire
people, and came to Jersey after the civil war--came here to be near their prince in his exile--settled
here and built Les Tourelles. I believe they expected Charles would do something handsome for
them when he came into his own, but he didn't do anything. Sir John Skipwith stayed in the
island and became a large landowner, and died at an advanced age--there is nothing to kill
people here, you see--and the Skipwiths have been Jersey people ever since. They were once
the richest family in the island. They are now one of the poorest. When I say they, I mean
my aunt. She is the last of her race. The Skipwiths have crystallised into one maiden lady,
my mother's only sister."

"Then your mother was a Skipwith?" asked Violet.

"Yes."

"And she was born and brought up here?"

"Yes. She never left Jersey till my father married her. He was here with his regiment when
they met at the governor's ball. Oh, here is my aunt," said the Captain, as a rustling of silk
sounded in the empty hall.

Vixen drew herself up stiffly, as if preparing to meet a foe. She had made up her mind to detest
Miss Skipwith.

The lady of the manor entered. She shook hands with her nephew, and presented him with a pale
and shrivelled cheek, which he respectfully saluted.

She was an elderly and faded person, very tall and painfully thin, but aristocratic to the
highest degree. There was the indication of race in her aquiline nose, high narrow brow and
neatly cut chin, her tapering hand and small slender foot. She was dressed in black silk, rustier
and older than any silk Vixen had ever seen before: not even excepting Mrs. Scobel's black
silk dresses, when they had been degraded from their original rank to the scrubbery of early
services and daily wear. Her thin gray hair was shaded by a black lace cap, decorated with
bugles and black weedy grasses. She wore black mittens, and jet jewellery, and was altogether
as deeply sable as if she had been in mourning for the whole of the Skipwith race.

She received Miss Tempest with a formal politeness which was not encouraging.

"I hope you will be able to make yourself happy here," she said; "and that you have resources
within yourself that will suffice for the employment of your time and thoughts. I receive no
company, and I never go out. The class of people who now occupy the island are a class with
which I should not care to associate, and which, I daresay, would not appreciate me. I have
my own resources, and my life is fully employed. My only complaint is that the days are not
long enough. A quiet existence like mine offers vast opportunities for culture and self-improvement.
I hope you will take advantage of them, Miss Tempest."

Poor Violet faltered something vaguely civil, looking sorely bewildered all the time. Miss
Skipwith's speech sounded so like the address of a schoolmistress that Vixen began to think
she had been trapped unawares in a school, as people are sometimes trapped in a madhouse.

"I don't think Miss Tempest is given much to study," said the Captain graciously, as if he
and Violet were on the friendliest terms; "but she is very fond of the country, and I am sure
the scenery of Jersey will delight her. By-the-way, we ventured to bring her big dog. He will
be a companion and protector for her in her walks. I have asked Doddery to find him a kennel
somewhere among your capacious outbuildings."

"He must not come into the house," said Miss Skipwith grimly; "I couldn't have a dog inside
my doors. I have a Persian that has been my attached companion for the last ten years. What
would that dear creature's feelings be if he saw himself exposed to the attacks of a savage dog?"

"My dog is not savage, to Persians or anyone else," cried Vixen, wondering what inauspicious
star had led the footsteps of an oriental wander to so dreary a refuge as Les Tourelles.

"You would like to see your bedroom, perhaps?" suggested Miss Skipwith, and on Violet's assenting,
she was handed over to Hannah Doddery, the woman who had opened the gate.

Hannah led the way up the broad old staircase, all bare and carpetless, and opened one of the
doors in the gallery. The room into which she ushered Violet was large and airy, with windows
commanding the fair garden-like island, and the wide blue sea. But there was the same bare,
poverty-stricken look in this room as in every other part of the manor house. The bed was a
tall melancholy four-poster, with scantiest draperies of faded drab damask. Save for one little
islet of threadbare Brussels beside the bed, the room was carpetless. There was an ancient
wainscot wardrobe with brass handles. There was a modern deal dressing-table skimpily draped
with muslin, and surmounted by the smallest of looking-glasses. There were a couple of chairs
and a three-cornered washhand-stand. There was neither sofa nor writing-table. There was not
an ornament on the high wooden mantelshelf, or a picture on the panelled walls. Vixen shivered
as she surveyed the big barren room.

"I think you will find everything comfortable," said Mrs. Doddery, with a formal air, which
seemed to say, "and whether you do or do not matters nothing to me."

"Thank you, yes, I daresay it is all right," Vixen answered absently, standing at one of the
windows, gazing out over the green hills and valleys to the fair summer sea, and wondering
whether she would be able to take comfort from the fertile beauty of the island.

"The bed has been well aired," continued Mrs. Doddery, "and I can answer for the cleanliness
of everything."

"Thanks! Will you kindly send one of the maids to help me unpack my portmanteau?"

"I can assist you," Mrs. Doddery answered. "We have no maid-servant. My husband and I are able
to do all that Miss Skipwith requires. She is a lady who gives so little trouble."

"Do you mean to say there are no other servants in this great house--no housemaids, no cooks?"

"I have cooked for Miss Skipwith for the last thirty years. The house is large, but there are
very few rooms in occupation."

"I ought to have brought my maid," cried Vixen. "It will be quite dreadful. I don't want much
waiting upon; but still, I'm afraid I shall give some trouble until I learn to do everything
for myself. Just as if I were cast on a desert island," she said to herself in conclusion;
and then she thought of Helen Rolleston, the petted beauty in Charles Reade's "Foul Play,"
cast with her faithful lover on an unknown island of the fair southern sea. But in this island
of Jersey there was no faithful lover to give romance and interest to the situation. There
was nothing but dull dreary reality.

"I daresay I shall be able to do all you require, without feeling it any extra trouble, unless
you are very helpless," said Mrs. Doddery, who was on her knees unstrapping one of the portmanteaux.

"I am not helpless," replied Vixen, "though I daresay I have been waited on much more than
was good for me."

And then she knelt down before the other portmanteau, and undid the buckles of the thick leather
straps, in which operation she broke more than one of her nails, and wounded her rosy finger-tips.

"Oh dear, what a useless creature I am," she thought; "and why do people strap portmanteaux
so tightly? Never mind, after a month's residence at Les Tourelles I shall be a Spartan."

"Would you like me to unpack your trunks for you?" inquired Mrs. Doddery, with an accent which
sounded slightly ironical.

"Oh no, thanks, I can get on very well now," answered Vixen quickly; whereupon the housekeeper
opened the drawers and cupboards in the big wainscot wardrobe, and left Miss Tempest to her
own devices.

The shelves and drawers were neatly lined with white paper, and strewed with dried lavender.
This was luxury which Vixen had not expected. She laid her pretty dresses on the shelves, smiling
scornfully as she looked at them. Of what use could pretty dresses be in a desert island? And
here were her riding-habit and her collection of whips--useless lumber where there was no hope
of a horse. She was obliged to put her books in the wardrobe, as there was no other place for
them. Her desk and workbox she was fain to place on the floor, for the small dressing-table
would accommodate no more than her dressing-case, devotional books, brushes and combs, pomatum-pots,
and pinboxes.

"Oh dear," she sighed. "I have a great deal too much property for a desert island. I wonder
whether in some odd corner of Les Tourelles I could find such a thing as a spare table?"

When she had finished her unpacking she went down to the hall. Not seeing anyone about, and
desiring rather to avoid Captain Winstanley and his aunt than to rejoin them, she wandered
out of the hall into one of the many passages of the old manor house, and began a voyage of
discovery on her own account.

"If they ask me what I have been doing I can say I lost myself," she thought.

She found the most curious rooms--or rather rooms that had once been stately and handsome,
now applied to the most curious purposes--a dining-hall with carved stone chimney-piece and
painted ceiling, used as a storehouse for apples; another fine apartment in which a heap of
potatoes reposed snugly in a corner, packed in straw; there was a spacious kitchen with a fire-place
as large as a moderate-sized room--a kitchen that had been abandoned altogether to spiders,
beetles, rats, and mice. A whole army of four-footed vermin scampered off as Vixen crossed
the threshold. She could see them scuttling and scurrying along by the wall, with a whisking
of slender tails as they vanished into their holes. The beetles were disporting themselves
on the desolate hearth, the spiders had woven draperies for the dim dirty windows. The rustling
leaves of a fig-tree, that had grown close to this side of the house, flapped against the window-panes
with a noise of exceeding ghostliness.

From the kitchen Vixen wandered to the out-houses, and found Argus howling dismally in a grass-grown
court-yard, evidently believing himself abandoned by the world. His rapture at beholding his
mistress was boundless.

"You darling, I would give the world to let you loose," cried Vixen, after she had been nearly
knocked down by the dog's affectionate greeting; "but I mustn't just yet. I'll come by-and-by
and take you for a walk. Yes, dear old boy, we'll have a long ramble together, just as we used
to do at home."

Home, now she had left it, seemed so sweet a word that her lips trembled a little as she pronounced
it.

Everything without the house was as dreary as it was within. Poverty had set its mark on all
things, like a blight. Decay was visible everywhere--in the wood-work, in the stone-work, in
hinges and handles, thresholds and lintels, ceilings and plastered walls. It would have cost
a thousand pounds to put the manor house in decent habitable order. To have restored it to
its original dignity and comeliness would have cost at least five thousand. Miss Skipwith could
afford to spend nothing upon the house she lived in; indeed she could barely afford the necessaries
of life. So for the last thirty years Les Tourelles had been gradually decaying, until the
good old house had arrived at a stage in which decay could hardly go farther without lapsing
into destruction.

A door opened out of the court-yard into the weedy garden. This was not without a kind of beauty
that had survived long neglect. The spreading fig-trees, the bushes of bright red fuchsia,
and the unpruned roses made a fertile wilderness of flowers and foliage. There was a terrace
in front of the drawing-room windows, and from this a flight of crumbling moss-grown stone
steps led down to the garden, which was on the slope of the hill, and lay considerably below
the level of the house.

While Vixen was perambulating the garden, a bell rang in a cupola on the roof; and as this
sounded like the summons to a meal, she felt that politeness, if not appetite, demanded her
return to the house.

"Three o'clock," she said, looking at her watch. "What a late hour for luncheon!"

She made her way back to the small side-door at which she had entered with Captain Winstanley,
and went into the parlour, where she found the Captain and his aunt. The table was laid, but
they had not seated themselves.

"I hope I have not kept you waiting," Vixen said apologetically.

"My aunt has been waiting five minutes or so; but I'm sure she will forgive you, as you don't
yet know the ways of the house," replied the Captain amiably.

"We have early habits at Les Tourelles, Miss Tempest," said the lady of the manor: "we breakfast
at half-past seven and dine at three; that arrangement gives me a long morning for study. At
six we drink tea, and, if you care for supper, it can be served for you on a tray at half-past
nine. The house is shut, and all lamps put out, at ten."

"As regularly as on board ship," said the Captain. "I know the customs of the manor of old."

"You have never favoured me with a long visit, Conrad," remarked Miss Skipwith reproachfully.

"My life has been too busy for making long visits anywhere, my dear aunt."

They took their places at the small square table, and Miss Skipwith said grace. Antony Doddery
was in attendance, clad in rusty black, and looking as like a butler as a man who cleaned windows,
scrubbed floors, and hewed wood could be fairly expected to look. He removed the cover of a
modest dish of fish with a grand air, and performed all the services of the table with as much
dignity as if he had never been anything less than a butler. He poured out a glass of ale for
the Captain and a glass of water for his mistress. Miss Skipwith seemed relieved when Violet
said she preferred water to ale, and did not particularly care about wine.

"I used to drink wine at home very often, just because it was put in my glass, but I like water
quite as well," said Vixen.

After the fish there came a small joint of lamb, and a couple of dishes of vegetables; then
a small custard pudding, and some cheese cut up in very minute pieces in a glass dish, some
raw garden-stuff which Doddery called salad, and three of last year's pears in an old Derby
dessert-dish. The dinner could hardly have been smaller, but it was eminently genteel.

The conversation was entirely between Captain Winstanley and his aunt. Vixen sat and listened
wonderingly, save at odd times, when her thoughts strayed back to the old life which she had
done with for ever.

"You still continue your literary labours, I suppose, aunt," said the Captain.

"They are the chief object of my existence. When I abandon them I shall have done with life,"
replied Miss Skipwith gravely.

"But you have not yet published your book."

"No; I hope when I do that even you will hear of it."

"I have no doubt it will make a sensation."

"If it does not I have lived and laboured in vain. But my book may make a sensation, and yet
fall far short of the result which I have toiled and hoped for."

"And that is----"

"The establishment of a universal religion."

"That is a large idea!"

"Would a small idea be worth the devotion of a life? For thirty years I have devoted myself
to this one scheme. I have striven to focus all the creeds of mankind in one brilliant centre--eliminating
all that is base and superstitious in each several religion, crystallising all that is good
and true. The Buddhist, the Brahmin, the Mohamedan, the Sun-worshipper, the Romanist, the Calvinist,
the Lutheran, the Wesleyan, the Swedenborgian--each and all will find the best and noblest
characteristics of his faith resolved and concentred in my universal religion. Here all creeds
will meet. Gentler and wiser than the theology of Buddha; more humanitarian than the laws of
Brahma; more temperate than the Moslem's code of morality; with a wider grasp of power than
the Romanist's authoritative Church; severely self-denying as Calvin's ascetic rule; simple
and pious as Wesley's scheme of man's redemption; spiritual as Swedenborg's vast idea of heaven;--my
faith will open its arms wide enough to embrace all. There need be no more dissent. The mighty
circle of my free church will enclose all creeds and all divisions of man, and spread from
the northern hemisphere to the southern seas. Heathenism shall perish before it. The limited
view of Christianity which missionaries have hitherto offered to the heathen may fail; but
my universal church will open its doors to all the world--and, mark my words, Conrad, all the
world will enter in. I may not live to see the day. My span of life has not long to run--but
that day will come."

"No doubt," replied Captain Winstanley gravely. "There is a slovenliness, so to speak, about
the present arrangement of things, and a great deal of useless expense; every small town with
its half-a-dozen churches and chapels of different denominations--Episcopalians, Wesleyans,
Baptists, Roman Catholics, Primitive Methodists. Now on your plan one large building would
do for all, like the town hall, or the general post office. There would be a wonderful economy."

"I fear you contemplate the question from an entirely temporal point of view," said Miss Skipwith,
flattered but yet reproachful. "It is its spiritual aspect that is grandest."

"Naturally. But a man of the world is apt to consider the practicability of a scheme. And yours
seems to me eminently practical. If you can only get the Mohamedans and the Brahmins to come
in! The Roman Catholics might of course be easily won, though it would involve doing away with
the Pope. There was a prophecy, by-the-way, that after the ninth Pius there would be only eleven
more Popes. No doubt that prophecy pointed at your universal religion. But I fear you may have
some difficulty about the Buddhists. I fancy they are rather a bigoted sect."

"The greatest bigots have but to be convinced," said Miss Skipwith. "St. Paul was a bigot."

"True. Is your book nearly finished?"

"No. There are still some years of labour before me. I am now working at the Swedenborgian
portion, striving to demonstrate how that great man's scheme of religion, though commonly supposed
to be a new and original emanation of one mind, is in reality a reproduction of spiritual views
involved in other and older religions. The Buddhists were Swedenborgians without knowing it,
just as Swedenborg unconsciously was a Buddhist."

"I begin to understand. The process which you are engaged in is a kind of spiritual chemistry,
in which you resolve each particular faith into its primary elements: with a view to prove
that those elements are actually the same in all creeds; and that the differences which heretofore
have kept mankind apart are mere divergencies of detail."

"That, crudely and imperfectly stated, is my aim," replied Miss Skipwith graciously.

This kind of conversation continued all through dinner. Miss Skipwith talked of Buddha, and
Confucius, and Mahomet, and Zuinglius, and Calvin, and Luther, as familiarly as if they had
been her most intimate friends; and the Captain led her on and played her as he would have
played a trout in one of the winding Hampshire streams. His gravity was imperturbable. Vixen
sat and wondered whether she was to hear this kind of thing every day of her life, and whether
she would be expected to ask Miss Skipwith leading questions, as the Captain was doing. It
was all very well for him, who was to spend only one day at Les Tourelles; but Vixen made up
her mind that she would boldly avow her indifference to all creeds and all theologians, from
Confucius to Swedenborg. She might consent to live for a time amidst the dullness and desolation
of Les Tourelles, but she would not be weighed down and crushed by Miss Skipwith's appalling
hobby. The mere idea of the horror of having every day to discuss a subject that was in its
very nature inexhaustible, filled her with terror.

"I would sooner take my meals in that abandoned kitchen, in the company of the rats and beetles,
than have to listen every day to this kind of thing," she thought.

When dinner was over the Captain went off to smoke his cigar in the garden, and this Vixen
thought a good time for making her escape.

"I should like to take a walk with my dog, if you will excuse me, Miss Skipwith," she said
politely.

"My dear, you must consider yourself at liberty to employ and amuse yourself as you please,
of course always keeping strictly within the bounds of propriety," solemnly replied the lady
of the manor. "I shall not interfere with your freedom. My own studies are of so grave a nature
that they in a measure isolate me from my fellow-creatures, but when you require and ask for
sympathy and advice, I shall be ready to give both. My library is at your service, and I hope
ere long you will have found yourself some serious aim for your studies. Life without purpose
is a life hardly worth living. If girls of your age could only find that out, and seek their
vocation early, how much grander and nobler would be woman's place in the universe. But, alas!
my dear, the common aim of girlhood seems to be to look pretty and to get married."

"I have made up my mind never to marry," said Violet, with a smile that was half sad half cynical;
"so there at least you may approve of me, Miss Skipwith."

"My nephew tells me that you refused an excellent offer from an Irish peer."

"I would not have done the Irish peer so great a wrong as to have married him without loving him."

"I admire your honourable feeling," said Miss Skipwith, with solemn approval; "I, too, might
have married, but the man towards whom my heart most inclined was a man of no family. I could
not marry a man without family. I am weak enough to be prouder of my pedigree than other women
are of beauty and fortune. I am the last of the Skipwiths, and I have done nothing to degrade
my race. The family name and the family pride will die with me. There was a time when a Skipwith
owned a third of the island. Our estate has dwindled to the garden and meadows that surround
this old house; our family has shrunk into one old woman; but if I can make the name of Skipwith
famous before I go down to my grave, I shall not have lived and laboured in vain."

Vixen felt a thrill of pity as she listened to this brief confession of a self-deluded solitary
soul, which had built its house upon sand, as hopefully as if the foundations were solidest
rock. The line of demarcation between such fanaticism as Miss Skipwith's and the hallucination
of an old lady in Bedlam, who fancies herself Queen Victoria, seemed to Vixen but a hair's
breadth. But, after all, if the old lady and Miss Skipwith were both happy in their harmless
self-deceptions, why should one pity them? The creature to be pitied is the man or woman who
keenly sees and feels the hard realities of life, and cannot take pleasure in phantoms.

Vixen ran off to her room to get her hat and gloves, delighted to find herself free. Miss Skipwith
was not such a very bad sort of person, after all, perhaps. Liberty to roam about the island
with her dog Vixen esteemed a great boon. She would be able to think about her troubles, unmolested
by inquisitive looks or unwelcome sympathy.

She went down to the court-yard, untied the faithful Argus, and they set out together to explore
the unknown, the dog in such wild spirits that it was almost impossible for Vixen to be sad.
The afternoon sun was shining in all his glory, birds were singing, flickering lights and shadows
playing on the grassy banks. Argus scampered up and down the lanes, and burst tumultuously
through gaps in the hedges, like a dog possessed of demons.

It was a pretty little island, after all; Vixen was fain to admit as much. There was some justification
for the people who sang its praises with such enthusiasm. One might have fancied it a fertile
corner of Devonshire that had slipped its moorings and drifted westward on a summer sea.

"If I had Arion here, and--Rorie, I think I could be almost happy," Vixen said to herself with
a dreamy smile.

"And Rorie!"

Alas, poor child! faintly, feebly steadfast in the barren path of honour: where could she not
have been happy with the companion of her childhood, the one only love of her youth? Was there
ever a spot of land or sea, from Hudson's Bay to the unmapped archipelago or hypothetical continent
of the Southern Pole, where she could not have been happy with Roderick Vawdrey? She thought
again of Helen Rolleston and her lover on the South Sea island. Ah what a happy fate was that
of the consumptive heroine! Alone, protected, cherished, and saved from death by her devoted lover.

Poor Rorie! She knew how well she loved him, now that the wide sea rolled between them, now
that she had said him nay, denied her love, and parted from him for ever.

She thought of that scene in the pine-wood, dimly lit by the young moon. She lived again those
marvellous moments--the concentrated bliss and pain of a lifetime. She felt again the strong
grasp of his hands, his breath upon her cheek, as he bent over her shoulder. Again she heard
him pleading for the life-long union her soul desired as the most exquisite happiness life
could give.

  "I had not loved thee, dear, so well
  Loved I not honour more."

Those two familiar lines flashed into her mind as she thought of her lover. To have degraded
herself, to have dishonoured him; no, it would have been too dreadful. Were he to plead again
she must answer again as she had answered before.

"His mother despised me," she thought. "If people in a better world are really au courant as
to the affairs of this, I should like Lady Jane Vawdrey to know that I am not utterly without
the instincts of a gentlewoman."

She wandered on, following the winding of the lanes, careless where she went, and determined
to take advantage of her liberty. She met few people, and of those she did not trouble herself
to ask her way.

"If I lose myself on my desert island it can't much matter," she thought. "There is no one
to be anxious about me. Miss Skipwith will be deep in her universal creed, and Captain Winstanley
would be very glad for me to be lost. My death would leave him master for life of the Abbey
House and all belonging to it."

She roamed on till she came to the open seashore; a pretty little harbour surrounded with quaint-looking
houses; two or three white villas in fertile gardens, on a raised road; and, dominating all
the scene, a fine old feudal castle, with keep, battlements, drawbridge, portcullis, and all
that becomes a fortress.

This was Mount Orgueil, the castle in which Charles Stuart spent a short period of his life,
while Cromwell was ruling by land and sea, and kingly hopes were at their lowest ebb. The good
old fortress had suffered for its loyalty, for the Parliament sent Admiral Blake, with a fleet,
to reduce the rebellious island to submission, and Mount Orgueil had not been strong enough
to hold out against its assailants.

Violet wont up the sloping path that led to the grim old gateway under the gloomy arch, and
still upward till she came to a sunny battlemented wall above the shining sea. The prospect
was more than worth the trouble. Yonder, in the dim distance, were the towers of Coutance Cathedral;
far away, mere spots in the blue water, were the smaller fry of the Channel Islands; below
her, the yellow sands were smiling in the sun, the placid wavelets reflecting all the colour
and glory of the changeful sky.

"This would not be a bad place to live in, Argus, if----"

She paused with her arm round her dog's neck, as he stood on end, looking over the parapet,
with a deep interest in possible rats or rabbits lurking in some cavity of the craggy cliff
below. If! Ah, what a big "if" that was! It meant love and dear familiar companionship. It
meant all Vixen's little world.

She lingered long. The scene was beautiful, and there was nothing to lure her home. Then, at
last, feeling that she was treating poor Miss Skipwith badly, and that her prolonged absence
might give alarm in that dreary household, she retraced her steps, and at the foot of the craggy
mount asked the nearest way to Les Tourelles.

The nearest way was altogether different from the track by which she had come, and brought
her back to the old monastic gate in a little more than an hour. She opened the gate and went
in. There was nothing for the most burglarious invader to steal at Les Tourelles, and bolts
and locks were rarely used. Miss Skipwith was reading in her parlour, a white Persian cat dozing
on a cushioned arm-chair beside her, some cups and saucers and a black teapot on a tray before
her, and the rest of the table piled with books. There was no sign of Captain Winstanley.

"I'm afraid I'm rather late," Vixen said apologetically.

She felt a kind of half-pitying respect for Miss Skipwith, as a harmless lunatic.

"My dear, I daresay that as an absolute fact you are late," answered the lady of the manor,
without looking up from her book, "but as time is never too long for me, I have been hardly
conscious of the delay. Your stepfather has gone down to the club at St. Helier's to see some
of his old acquaintances. Perhaps you would like a cup of tea?"

Vixen replied that she would very much like some tea, whereupon Miss Skipwith poured out a
weak and tepid infusion, against which the girl inwardly protested.

"If I am to exist at Les Tourelles, I must at least have decent tea," she said to herself.
"I must buy an occasional pound for my own consumption, make friends with Mrs. Doddery, and
get her to brew it for me."

And then Vixen knelt down by the arm-chair and tried to get upon intimate terms with the Persian.
He was a serious-minded animal, and seemed inclined to resent her advances, so she left him
in peace on his patchwork cushion, a relic of those earlier days when Miss Skipwith had squandered
her precious hours on the feminine inanity of needle-work.

Vixen thought of the German Volkslied, as she looked at the old lady in the black cap, bending
over a ponderous volume, with the solemn-visaged cat coiled on the chair beside her.

"Minerva's Vogel war ein Kauz."

The Persian cat seemed as much an attribute of the female theologian as the bird of the goddess.

Vixen went to her room soon after dark, and thus avoided the Captain, who did not return till
ten. She was worn out with the fatigue of the voyage, her long ramble, the painful thoughts
and manifold agitations of the last two days. She set her candle on the dressing-table, and
looked round the bare empty room, feeling as if she were in a dream. It was all strange, and
unhomely, and comfortless; like one of those wild dream-pictures which seem so appallingly
real in their hideous unreality.

"And I am to live here indefinitely--for the next six years, perhaps, until I come of age and
am my own mistress. It is too dreadful!"

She went to bed and slept a deep and comforting sleep, for very weariness: and she dreamt that
she was walking on the battlements of Mount Orgueil, in the drowsy afternoon sunlight, with
Charles Stuart; and the face of the royal exile was the face of Roderick Vawdrey, and the hand
that held hers as they two stood side by side in the sunshine was the broad strong hand of
her girlhood's friend.

When she went downstairs between eight and nine next morning she found Miss Skipwith pacing
slowly to and fro the terrace in front of the drawing-room windows, conning over the pencil
notes of her yesterday's studies.

"Your stepfather has been gone half-an-hour, my dear," said the lady of the manor. "He was
very sorry to have to go without wishing you good-bye."

CHAPTER II.

Chiefly Financial.

Violet was gone. Her rooms were empty; her faithful little waiting-maid was dismissed; her
dog's deep-toned thunder no longer sounded through the house, baying joyous welcome when his
mistress came down for her early morning ramble in the shrubberies. Arion had been sent to
grass, and was running wild in fertile pastures, shoeless and unfettered as the South American
mustang on his native prairie. Nothing associated with the exiled heiress was left, except
the rooms she had inhabited; and even they looked blank and empty and strange without her.
It was almost as if a whole family had departed. Vixen's presence seemed to have filled the
house with youth and freshness, and free joyous life. Without her all was silent as the grave.

Mrs. Winstanley missed her daughter sorely. She had been wont to complain fretfully of the
girl's exuberance; but the blank her absence made struck a chill to the mother's heart. She
had fancied that life would be easier without Violet; that her union with her husband would
be more complete; and now she found herself looking wistfully towards the door of her morning-room,
listening vaguely for a footstep; and the figure she looked for at the door, and the footsteps
she listened for in the corridor were not Conrad Winstanley's. It was the buoyant step of her
daughter she missed; it was the bright frank face of her daughter she yearned for.

One day the captain surprised her in tears, and asked the reason of her melancholy.

"I daresay it's very weak of me, Conrad," she said piteously, "but I miss Violet more and more
every day."

"It is uncommonly weak of you," answered the Captain with agreeable candour, "but I suppose
it's natural. People generally get attached to their worries; and as your daughter was an incessant
worry, you very naturally lament her absence. I am honest enough to confess that I am very
glad she is gone. We had no domestic peace while she was with us."

"But she is not to stay away for ever, Conrad. I cannot be separated from my only daughter
for ever. That would be too dreadful."

"'For ever' is a long word," answered the Captain coolly. "She will come back to us--of course."

"When, dear?"

"When she is older and wiser."

This was cold comfort. Mrs. Winstanley dried her tears, and resumed her crewel-work. The interesting
variety of shades in green which modern art has discovered were a source of comfort to the
mother's troubled mind. Moved to emulation by the results that had been achieved in artistic
needle-work by the school at South Kensington and the Royal Tapestry Manufactory at Windsor,
Pamela found in her crewel-work an all-absorbing labour. Matilda of Normandy could hardly have
toiled more industriously at the Bayeux tapestry than did Mrs. Winstanley, in the effort to
immortalise the fleeting glories of woodland blossom or costly orchid upon kitchen towelling.

It was a dull and lonely life which the mistress of the Abbey House led in these latter days
of glowing summer weather; and perhaps it was only the distractions of crewels and point-lace
which preserved her from melancholy madness. The Captain had been too long a bachelor to renounce
the agreeable habits of a bachelor's existence. His amusements were all masculine, and more
or less solitary. When there was no hunting, he gave himself up to fishing, and found his chief
delight in the persecution of innocent salmon. He supplied the Abbey House larder with fish,
sent an occasional basket to a friend, and dispatched the surplus produce of his rod to a fishmonger
in London. He was an enthusiast at billiards, and would play with innocent Mr. Scobel rather
than not play at all. He read every newspaper and periodical of mark that was published. He
rode a good deal, and drove not a little in a high-wheeled dog-cart; quite an impossible vehicle
for a lady. He transacted all the business of house, stable, gardens, and home-farm, and that
in the most precise and punctual manner. He wrote a good many letters, and he smoked six or
seven cigars every day. It must be obvious, therefore, that he had very little time to devote
to his pretty middle-aged wife, whose languid airs and vapourish graces were likely to pall
upon an ardent temper after a year of married life. Yet, though she found her days lonely,
Mrs. Winstanley had no ground for complaint. What fault could a woman find in a husband who
was always courteous and complimentary in his speech, whose domestic tastes were obvious, who
thought it no trouble to supervise the smallest details of the household, who could order a
dinner, lay out a garden, stock a conservatory, or amend the sanitary arrangements of a stable
with equal cleverness; who never neglected a duty towards wife or society?

Mrs. Winstanley could see no flaw in the perfection of her husband's character; but it began
about this time slowly to dawn upon her languid soul that, as Captain Winstanley's wife, she
was not so happy as she had been as Squire Tempest's widow.

Her independence was gone utterly. She awoke slowly to the comprehension of that fact. Her
individuality was blotted out, or absorbed into her husband's being. She had no more power
or influence in her own house, than the lowest scullion in her kitchen. She had given up her
banking account, and the receipt of her rents, which in the days of her widowhood had been
remitted to her half-yearly by the solicitor who collected them. Captain Winstanley had taken
upon himself the stewardship of his wife's income. She had been inclined to cling to her cheque-book
and her banking account at Southampton; but the Captain had persuaded her of the folly of such
an arrangement.

"Why two balances and two accounts, when one will do?" he argued. "You have only to ask me
for a cheque when you want it, or to give me your bills."

Whereupon the bride of six weeks had yielded graciously, and the balance had been transferred
from the Southampton bank to Captain Winstanley's account at the Union.

But now, with Theodore's unsettled account of four years' standing hanging over her head by
the single hair of the penny post, and likely to descend upon her any morning, Mrs. Winstanley
regretted her surrendered banking account, with its balance of eleven hundred pounds or so.
The Captain had managed everything with wondrous wisdom, no doubt. He had done away with all
long credits. He paid all his bills on the first Saturday in the month, save such as could
be paid weekly. He had reduced the price of almost everything supplied to the Abbey House,
from the stable provender to the wax candles that lighted the faded sea-green draperies and
white panelling of the drawing-room. The only expenditure over which he had no control was
his wife's private disbursement; but he had a habit of looking surprised when she asked him
for a cheque, and a business-like way of asking the amount required, which prevented her applying
to him often. Still, there was that long-standing account of Madame Theodore's in the background,
and Mrs. Winstanley felt that it was an account which must be settled sooner or later. Her
disinclination to ask her husband for money had tended to swell Theodore's bill. She had bought
gloves, ribbons, shoes, everything from that tasteful purveyor, and had even obtained the somewhat
expensive material for her fancy work through Madame Theodore; a temporary convenience which
she could hardly hope to enjoy gratis.

Like all weak women she had her occasional longings for independence, her moments of inward
revolt against the smooth tyrant. The income was hers, she argued with herself sometimes, and
she had a right to spend her own money as she pleased. But then she recalled her husband's
grave warnings about the future and its insecurity. She had but a brief lease of her present
wealth, and he was labouring to lay by a provision for the days to come.

"It would be wicked of me to thwart him in such a wise purpose," she told herself.

The restriction of her charities pained the soft-hearted Pamela not a little. To give to all
who asked her had been the one unselfish pleasure of her narrow soul. She had been imposed
upon, of course; had fed families whose fathers squandered their weekly wages in the cosy taproom
of a village inn; had in some wise encouraged idleness and improvident living; but she had
been the comforter of many a weary heart, the benefactor of many a patient care-oppressed mother,
the raiser-up of many a sickly child drooping on its bed of pain.

Now, under the Captain's rule, she had the pleasure of seeing her name honourably recorded
in the subscription list of every local charity: but her hand was no longer open to the surrounding
poor, her good old Saxon name of Lady had lost its ancient significance. She was no longer
the giver of bread to the hungry. She sighed and submitted, acknowledging her husband's superior
wisdom.

"You would not like to live in a semi-detached villa on the Southampton Road, would you, my
dear Pamela?" asked the Captain.

"I might die in a semi-detached house, Conrad. I'm sure I could not live in one," she exclaimed
piteously.

"Then, my love, we must make a tremendous effort and save all we can before your daughter comes
of age, or else we shall assuredly have to leave the Abbey House. We might go abroad certainly,
and live at Dinan, or some quiet old French town where provisions are cheap."

"My dear Conrad, I could not exist in one of those old French towns, smelling perpetually of
cabbage-soup."

"Then, my dear love, we must exercise the strictest economy, or life will be impossible six
years hence."

Pamela sighed and assented, with a sinking of her heart. To her mind this word economy was
absolutely the most odious in the English language. Her life was made up of trifles; and they
were all expensive trifles. She liked to be better dressed than any woman of her acquaintance.
She liked to surround herself with pretty things; and the prettiness must take the most fashionable
form, and be frequently renewed. She had dim ideas which she considered aesthetic, and which
involved a good deal of shifting and improving of furniture.

Against all these expensive follies Captain Winstanley set his face sternly, using pretty words
to his wife at all times, but proving himself as hard as rock when she tried to bend him to
her will. He had not yet interfered with her toilet, for he had yet to learn what that cost.

This knowledge came upon him like a thunder-clap one sultry morning in July--real thunder impending
in the metallic-tinted sky--about a month after Vixen's departure.

Theodore's long-expected bill was among the letters in the morning's bag--a bulky envelope
which the Captain handed to his wife with his usual politeness. He never opened her letters,
but he invariably asked to see them, and she always handed her correspondence over to him with
a childlike meekness. To-day she was slow to hand the Captain her letter. She sat looking at
the long list of items with a clouded brow, and forgot to pour out her husband's coffee in
the abstraction of a troubled mind.

"I'm afraid your letters of this morning are not of a very pleasant character, my love," said
the Captain, watchful of his wife's clouded countenance. "Is that a bill you are examining?
I thought we paid ready money for everything."

"It is my dressmaker's bill," faltered Mrs. Winstanley.

"A dressmaker's bill! That can't be very alarming. You look as awful, and the document looks
as voluminous, as if it were a lawyer's bill, including the costs of two or three unlucky Chancery
suits, or half-a-dozen conveyances. Let me have the account, dear, and I'll send your dressmaker
a cheque next Saturday."

He held out his hand for the paper, but Pamela did not give it to him.

"I'm afraid you'll think it awfully high, Conrad," she said, in a deprecating tone. "You see
it has been running a long time--since the Christmas before dear Edward's death, in fact. I
have paid Theodore sums on account in the meanwhile, but those seem to go for very little against
the total of her bill. She is expensive, of course. All the West End milliners are; but her
style is undeniable, and she is in direct association with Worth."

"My dear Pamela, I did not ask you for her biography, I asked only for her bill. Pray let me
see the total, and tell me if you have any objections to make against the items."

"No," sighed Mrs. Winstanley, bending over the document with a perplexed brow, "I believe--indeed,
I am sure--I have had all the things. Many of them are dearer than I expected; but there is
no rule as to the price of anything thoroughly Parisian, that has not been seen in London.
One has to pay for style and originality. The chocolate is delicious all the same, and is of the
consistency of oatmeal porridge very light and well frothed up and is served in small coffee-cups.
The chocolate is "eaten" by dipping little finger-rusks or sponge-chips
into the mixture.

The glass of cold water is given after it. This is, however, rather an exception; lemonade,
azucarillas and water, or tea served in a separate room about twelve
o'clock, is more usual.

The azucarilla is more porous and of the nature of a meringue.

The azucarilla is a confection not unlike "Edinburgh rockâ. It instantly dissolves when You
stir the water with it. It will flavor the water with vanilla, lemon, or orange, as well as sugar.
Sometimes you are offered meringues, which you eat first, and then
drink the water.

A Spanish lady never rises to receive a gentleman; but when any ladies entered the large
drawing-room where we were all seated, every one rose and stood while the new arrivals made the
circuit of the room, shaking hands with their friends or kissing them on both cheeks, and giving
a somewhat undignified little nod to those whom they did not know.

I have a very perfect recollection of my first tertulia in Madrid, when I was a very young girl.
We had been asked to go quite early, as we were the strangers of
the evening.

The first time every one rose I thought we were going to sing a hymn, or take part in some
ceremony; but as it had to be repeated each time a lady entered the
room, I began to wish they would all come at once.

Between seventy and eighty guests dropped in, the ladies chiefly in morning dress, as we understand
the word. When you are introduced to a partner, the first thing he does is to inquire your
Christian name; from that time forth he addresses you by it, as if
he had known you from infancy, and in speaking to him you are expected
to use his surname alone.

If there be more than one brother, you address the younger one as "Arturo," "Ramon," or whatever
his Christian name may be. The diminutives are, however, almost always used--Pacquita, Juanito,
etc., in place of Francisca or Juan.

Even the middle-aged and old ladies are always spoken to by their Christian names, and it is
quite common to hear a child of six addressing a lady who is probably a grandmother as "Luisa"
or "Mariquita."
ows round the walls, while the men blocked up the doorways and looked bored. There were no "flirting
corners," and sitting out on the stairs Ã  deux would have been a compromiso. The whole company
broke up into little knots and circles, the chairs, which had been pushed into corners or an
ante-room, were fetched out, and the men, without any sort of shyness, generally seated themselves in
front of the ladies, and kept up a perfectly wild hubbub of conversation
until the music for the next dance struck up.

Dowagers and dueÃ±as were few; they sat in the same spot all the
evening, and asked each other what rent they paid, how many chimeneas
(fireplaces) they had, whether they burned wood or coal, and lamented
over the price of both.

They reminded one irresistibly of the "two crumbly old women" in Kavanagh "who talked about moths,
and cheap furniture, and the best cure for rheumatism."
The dances were the same as ours, with some small differences: the
rigodon is a variation of the quadrille, and the lancers are slightly
curtailed.

There was a decided fancy for the polka and a species of mazurka,
which I remembered having learned from a dancing-master in the dawn
of life, under some strange and forgotten name.

Spaniards dance divinely--nothing less.

They waltz as few other men do, a very poetry of motion, an abandonment
of enjoyment, as if their soul were in it, especially if the music
be somewhat languid.

This is especially the case with the artillery officers, who are great favourites in society, and
belong exclusively to the upper ranks.
I have described this tertulia at length because it was a typical one of many. The cotillon was
a great favourite, and generally closed the evening.


I will give up dealing with Theodore, if you like--though it will be a hard trial, after she
has worked for me so many years, and has studied my style and knows exactly what suits me.
I will dress ever so plainly, and even have my gowns made by a Southampton dressmaker, though
that will be too dreadful. You will hardly recognise me. But I will do anything--anything,
Conrad, rather than hear you speak so cruelly."

She went over to him and laid her hand tremulously on his shoulder, and looked down at him
with piteous, pleading eyes. No Circassian slave, afraid of bowstring and sack, could have
entreated her master's clemency with deeper self-abasement.

Even Conrad Winstanley's hard nature was touched by the piteousness of her look and tone. He
took the hand gently and raised it to his lips.

"I don't mean to be cruel, Pamela," he said. "I only want you to face the truth, and to understand
your future position. It is your own money you are squandering, and you have a right to waste
it, if it pleases you to do so. But it is a little hard for a man who has laboured and schemed
for a given result, suddenly to find himself out in his calculations by so much as thirteen
hundred and sixty-four pounds. Let us say no more about it, my dear. Here is the bill, and
it must be paid. We have only to consider the items, and see if the prices are reasonable."

And then the Captain, with bent brow and serious aspect, began to read the lengthy record of
an English lady's folly. Most of the items he passed over in silence, or with only a sigh,
keeping his wife by his side, looking over his shoulder.

"Point out anything that is wrong," he said; but as yet Mrs. Winstanley had found no error
in the bill.

Sometimes there came an item which moved the Captain to speech. "A dinner-dress, pain brûlé
brocade, mixed poult de soie, manteau de cour, lined ivory satin, trimmed with hand-worked
embroidery of wild flowers on Brussels net, sixty-three pounds."

"What in the name of all that's reasonable is pain brûlé?" asked the Captain impatiently.

"It's the colour, Conrad. One of those delicate tertiaries that have been so much worn lately."

"Sixty guineas for a dinner-dress! That's rather stiff. Do you know that a suit of dress-clothes
costs me nine pounds, and lasts almost as many years?"

"My dear Conrad, for a man it is so different. No one looks at your clothes. That dress was
for Lady Ellangowan's dinner. You made me very happy that night, for you told me I was the
best-dressed woman in the room."

"I should not have been very happy myself if I had known the cost of your gown," answered the
Captain grimly. "Fifteen guineas for a Honiton fichu!" he cried presently. "What in mercy's
name is a fichu? It sounds like a sneeze."

"It is a little half-handkerchief that I wear to brighten a dark silk dress when we dine alone,
Conrad. You know you have always said that lace harmonises a woman's dress, and gives a softness
to the complexion and contour."

"I shall be very careful what I say in future," muttered the Captain, as he went on with the
bill. "French cambric peignoir, trimmed real Valenciennes, turquoise ribbon, nineteen guineas,"
he read presently. "Surely you would never give twenty pounds for a gown you wear when you
are having your hair dressed?"

"That is only the name, dear. It is really a breakfast-dress. You know you always like to see
me in white of a morning."

The Captain groaned and said nothing.

"Come," he said, by-and-by, "this surely must be a mistake. 'Shooting dress, superfine silk
corduroy, trimmed and lined with cardinal poult de soie, oxydised silver buttons, engraved
hunting subjects, twenty-seven guineas.' Thank Heaven you are not one of those masculine women
who go out shooting, and jump over five-barred gates."

"The dress is quite right, dear, though I don't shoot. Theodore sent it to me for a walking-dress,
and I have worn it often when we have walked in the Forest. You thought it very stylish and
becoming, though just a little fast."

"I see," said the Captain, with a weary air, "your not shooting does not hinder your having
shooting-dresses. Are there any fishing-costumes, or riding-habits, in the bill?"

"No, dear. It was Theodore's own idea to send me the corduroy dress. She thought it so new
and recherché, and even the Duchess admired it. Mine was the first she had ever seen."

"That was a triumph worth twenty-seven guineas, no doubt," sighed the Captain. "Well, I suppose
there is no more to be said. The bill to me appears iniquitous. If you were a duchess or a
millionaire's wife, of course it would be different. Such women have a right to spend all they
can upon dress. They encourage trade. I am no Puritan. But when a woman dresses beyond her
means--above her social position--I regret the wise old sumptuary laws which regulated these
things in the days when a fur coat was a sign of nobility. If you only knew, Pamela, how useless
this expensive finery is, how little it adds to your social status, how little it enhances
your beauty! Why, the finest gown this Madame Theodore ever made cannot hide one of your wrinkles."

"My wrinkles!" cried Pamela, sorely wounded. "That is the first time I ever heard of them.
To think that my husband should be the first to tell me I am getting an old woman! But I forgot,
you are younger than I, and I daresay in your eyes I seem quite old."

"My dear Pamela, be reasonable. Can a woman's forehead at forty be quite as smooth as it was
at twenty? However handsome a woman is at that age--and to my mind it is almost the best age
for beauty, just as the ripe rich colouring of a peach is lovelier than the poor little pale
blossom that preceded it--however attractive a middle-aged woman may be there must be some
traces to show that she has lived half her life; and to suppose that pain brûlé brocade, and
hand-worked embroidery, can obliterate those, is extreme folly. Dress in rich and dark velvets,
and old point-lace that has been twenty years in your possession, and you will be as beautiful
and as interesting as a portrait by one of the old Venetian masters. Can Theodore's highest
art make you better than that?

It is the fancy that swells your milliner's bill, the newly-invented trimmings, the complex
and laborious combinations."

"I will be dreadfully economical in future, Conrad. For the last year I have dressed to please
you."

"But what becomes of all these gowns?" asked the Captain, folding up the bill; "what do you
do with them?"

"They go out."

"Out where? To the colonies?"

"No, dear; they go out of fashion; and I give them to Pauline."

"A sixty-guinea dress flung to your waiting-maid! The Duchess of Dovedale could not do things
in better style."

"I should be very sorry not to dress better than the Duchess," said Mrs. Winstanley, "she is
always hideously dowdy. But a duchess can afford to dress as badly as she likes."

"I see. Then it is we only who occupy the border-land of society who have to be careful. Well,
my dear Pamela, I shall send Madame Theodore her cheque, and with your permission close her
account; and, unless you receive some large accession of fortune I should recommend you not
to reopen it."

His wife gave a heart-breaking sigh.

"I would sacrifice anything for your sake, Conrad," she said, "but I shall be a perfect horror,
and you will hate me."

"I fell in love with you, my dear, not with your gown."

"But you fell in love with me in my gown, dear; and you don't know how different your feelings
might have been if you had seen me in a gown cut by a country dressmaker."

Captain Winstanley never again alluded to the dressmaker's bill. He was too wise a man to reopen
old wounds or to dwell upon small vexations. He had invested every penny that he could spare,
leaving the smallest balance at his banker's compatible with respectability. He had to sell
some railway shares in order to pay Madame Theodore. Happily the shares had gone up since his
purchase of them, and he lost nothing by the transaction; but it galled him sorely to part
with the money. It was as if an edifice that he had been toilfully raising, stone by stone,
had begun to crumble under his hands. He knew not when or whence the next call might come.
The time in which he had to save money was so short. Only six years, and the heiress would
claim her estate, and Mrs. Winstanley would be left with the empty shell of her present position--the
privilege of occupying a fine old Tudor mansion, with enormous stables, and fifteen acres of
garden and shrubberies, and an annuity that would barely suffice to maintain existence in a
third-rate London square.

Mrs. Winstanley was slow to recover from the shock of her husband's strong language about Theodore's
bill. She was sensitive about all things that touched her own personality, and she was peculiarly
sensitive about the difference between her husband's age and her own. She had married a man
who was her junior; but she had married him with the conviction that, in his eyes at least,
she had all the bloom and beauty of youth, and that he admired and loved her above all other
women. That chance allusion to her wrinkles had pierced her heart. She was deeply afflicted
by the idea that her husband had perceived the signs of advancing years in her face. And now
she fell to perusing her looking-glass more critically than she had ever done before. She saw
herself in the searching north light; and the north light was more cruel and more candid than
Captain Winstanley. There were lines on her forehead--unmistakable, ineffaceable lines. She
could wear her hair in no way that would hide them, unless she had hidden her forehead altogether
under a bush of frizzy fluffy curls. There was a faded look about her complexion, too, which
she had never before discovered--a wanness, a yellowness. Yes, these things meant age! In such
a spirit, perchance, did Elizabeth of England survey the reflection in her mirror, until all
the glories of her reign seemed as nothing to her when weighed against this dread horror of
fast-coming age. And luckless Mary, cooped up in the narrow rooms at Fotheringay, may have
deemed captivity, and the shadow of doom, as but trifling ills compared with the loss of youth
and beauty. Once to have been exquisitely beautiful, the inspiration of poets, the chosen model
of painters, and to see the glory fading--that, for a weak woman, must be sorrow's crown of sorrow.

Anon dim feelings of jealousy began to gnaw Pamela's heart. She grew watchful of her husband's
attentions to other women, suspicious of looks and words that meant no more than a man's desire
to please. Society no longer made her happy. Her Tuesday afternoons lost their charm. There
was poison in everything. Lady Ellangowan's flirting ways, which had once only amused her,
now tortured her. Captain Winstanley's devotion to this lively matron, which had heretofore
seemed only the commoner's tribute of respect to the peeress, now struck his wife as a too
obvious infatuation for the woman. She began to feel wretched in the society of certain women--nay,
of all women who were younger, or possibly more attractive, than herself. She felt that the
only security for her peace would be to live on a desert island with the husband she had chosen.
She was of too weak a mind to hide these growing doubts and ever-augmenting suspicions. The
miserable truth oozed out of her in foolish little speeches; those continual droppings that
wear the hardest stone, and which wore even the adamantine surface of the Captain's tranquil
temper. There was a homoeopathic admixture of this jealous poison in all the food he ate. He
could rarely get through a tête-à-tête breakfast or dinner undisturbed by some invidious remark.

One day the Captain rose up in his strength, and grappled with this jealous demon. He had let
the little speeches, the random shots, pass unheeded until now; but on one particularly dismal
morning, a bleak March morning, when the rain beat against the windows, and the deodoras and
cypresses were lashed and tormented by the blusterous wind, and the low sky was darkly gray,
the captain's temper suddenly broke out.

"My dear Pamela, is it possible that these whimpering little speeches of yours mean jealousy?"
he asked, looking at her severely from under bent brows.

"I'm sure I never said that I was jealous," faltered Pamela, stirring her tea with a nervous
movement of her thin white band.

"Of course not; no woman cares to describe herself in plain words as an idiot; but of late
you have favoured me with a good many imbecile remarks, which all seem to tend one way. You
are hurt and wounded when I am decently civil to the women I meet in society. Is that sensible
or reasonable, in a woman of your age and experience?"

"You used not to taunt me with my age before we were married, Conrad."

"Do I taunt you with it now? I only say that a woman of forty,"--Mrs. Winstanley shuddered--"ought
to have more sense than a girl of eighteen; and that a woman who had had twenty years' experience
of well-bred society ought not to put on the silly jealousies of a school-girl trying to provoke
a quarrel with her first lover."

"It is all very well to pretend to think me weak and foolish, Conrad. Yes, I know I am weak,
ridiculously weak, in loving you as intensely as I do. But I cannot help that. It is my nature
to cling to others, as the ivy clings to the oak. I would have clung to Violet, if she had
been more loving and lovable. But you cannot deny that your conduct to Lady Ellangowan yesterday
afternoon was calculated to make any wife unhappy."

"If a wife is to be unhappy because her husband talks to another woman about her horses and
her gardens, I suppose I gave you sufficient cause for misery," answered the Captain sneeringly.
"I can declare that Lady Ellangowan and I were talking of nothing more sentimental."

"Oh, Conrad, it is not what you talked about, though your voice was so subdued that it was
impossible for anyone to know what you were saying----"

"Except Lady Ellangowan."

"It was your manner. The way you bent over her, your earnest expression."

"Would you have had me stand three yards off and bawl at the lady? Or am I bound to assume
that bored and vacuous countenance which some young men consider good form? Come, my dear Pamela,
pray let us be reasonable. Here are you and I settled for life beside the domestic hearth.
We have no children. We are not particularly well off--it will be as much as we shall be able
to do, by-and-by, to make both ends meet. We are neither of us getting younger. These things
are serious cares, and we have to bear them. Why should you add to these an imaginary trouble,
a torment that has no existence, save in your own perverse mind? If you could but know my low
estimate of the women to whom I am civil! I like society: and to get on in society a man must
make himself agreeable to influential women. It is the women who have the reins in the social
race, and by-and-by, if I should go into Parliament----"

"Parliament!" cried his wife affrightedly. "You want to become a Member of Parliament, and
to be out at all hours of the night! Our home-life would be altogether destroyed then."

"My dear Pamela, if you take such pains to make our home-life miserable, it will be hardly
worth preserving," retorted the Captain.

"Conrad, I am going to ask you a question--a very solemn question."

"You alarm me."

"Long ago--before we were married--when Violet was arguing with me against our marriage--you
know how vehemently she opposed it--"

"Perfectly. These are the first-class objects of man.

Just now the wise man of this world, a skeptic asks the question: Could not the first man,
with all these objects before him, learn from the use of reason that
all these objects came from a creator?

And if I could certainly did not need the revelation, then, the reasoning of the nature of
God in nature, could then, from the order, beauty and harmony of
all, get to the idea of his character, and thus infer knowledge of
his will, and if so, a revelation was not necessary.

This seems very clear, and often say that "the truth is clear." This is my reason for rejecting
the idea that a revelation was ever made.
Do you, Mr. Christian, deal with it?

I'd be happy if there was anything in it to deal with, but you will not see anything real
in its facilities, for objects without an instructor to teach anything. There is a brick, pick
up and examine its surface area, is not it, it, get to the idea of
their creator?

No. However, I know I must have been done, because I've seen other
bricks fact, what they think.

Very good.

Have you ever seen worlds done, and if so, does our country look
like them?

But when he saw the bricks were there several men not involved in
their manufacture, and horses?

There is no analogy in their facilities, you pose the question completely, you take everything
for granted the foundation, his argument is "as clear as mud."
Have you seen others made by only one manufacturer, then and only then could, by analogy, have
gone even to the idea that ours was also made.

In addition, the manufacturers of the bricks may have been more basic layout and evil, so you
can learn anything from your choice of bricks, but only testify on
the ability of its creators - that's all.

Do not you give me nothing to deal with? The truth is this, nature
does not give any sufficient basis for religion.

Revelation is necessarily that we provide.

Without revelation can not learn of the existence and nature of God.

The knowledge of its existence, the power and wisdom could excite reverence, but that alone
could not provide religious powers of man into activity. To this we must add the knowledge of
his goodness and kindness, and love for those who are forced to worship him.
 We plod on drearily, and can see no Pole Star in
life's darkening sky.

It had been thus of late with Pamela Winstanley. Slowly and gradually the conviction had come
to her that her second marriage had been a foolish and ill-advised transaction, resulting inevitably
in sorrow and unavailing remorse. The sweet delusion that it had been a love-match on Captain
Winstanley's side, as well as on her own, abandoned her all at once, and she found herself
face to face with stern common-sense.

That scene about Theodore's bill had exercised a curious effect upon her mind. To an intellect
so narrow, trifles were important, and that the husband who had so much admired and praised
the elegance of her appearance could grudge the cost of her toilet galled her sorely. It was
positively for her the first revelation of her husband's character. His retrenchments in household
expenses she had been ready to applaud as praiseworthy economies; but when he assailed her
own extravagance, she saw in him a husband who loved far too wisely to love well.

"If he cared for me, if he valued my good looks, he could never object to my spending a few
pounds upon a dress," she told herself.

She could not take the Captain's common-sense view of a subject so important to herself. Love
in her mind meant a blind indulgence like the Squire's. Love that could count the cost of its
idol's caprices, and calculate the chances of the future, was not love. That feeling of poverty,
too, was a new sensation to the mistress of the Abbey House, and a very unpleasant one. Married
very young to a man of ample means, who adored her, and never set the slightest restriction
upon her expenditure, extravagance had become her second nature. To have to study every outlay,
to ask herself whether she could not do without a thing, was a hard trial; but it had become
so painful to her to ask the Captain for money that she preferred the novel pain of self-denial
to that humiliation. And then there was the cheerless prospect of the future always staring
her in the face, that dreary time after Violet's majority, when it would be a question whether
she and her husband could afford to go on living at the Abbey House.

"Everybody will know that my income is diminished," she thought. "However well we may manage,
people will know that we are pinching."

This was a vexatious reflection. The sting of poverty itself could not be so sharp as the pain
of being known to be poor.

Captain Winstanley pursued the even tenor of his way all this time, and troubled himself but
little about his wife's petty sorrows. He did his duty to her according to his own lights,
and considered that she had no ground for complaint. He even took pains to be less subdued
in his manner to Lady Ellangowan, and to give no shadow of reason for the foolish jealousy
he so much despised. His mind was busy about his own affairs. He had saved money since his
marriage, and he employed himself a good deal in the investment of his savings. So far he had
been lucky in all he touched, and had contrived to increase his capital by one or two speculative
ventures in foreign railways. If things went on as well for the next six years he and his wife
might live at the Abbey House, and maintain their station in the county, till the end of the
chapter.

"I daresay Pamela will outlive me," thought the Captain; "those fragile-looking invalid women
are generally long lived. And I have all the chances of the hunting-field, and vicious horses,
and other men's blundering with loaded guns, against me. What can happen to a woman who sits
at home and works crewel antimacassars and reads novels all day, and never drinks anything
stronger than tea, and never eats enough to disturb her digestion? She ought to be a female
Methuselah."

Secure in this idea or his wife's longevity, and happy in his speculations, Captain Winstanley
looked forward cheerfully to the future: and the evil shadow of the day when the hand of fate
should thrust him from the good old house where he was master had never fallen across his dreams.

CHAPTER IV.

Love and AEsthetics.

Spring had returned, primroses and violets were being sold at the street-corners, Parliament
was assembled, and London had reawakened from its wintry hibernation to new life and vigour.
The Dovedales were at their Kensington mansion. The Duchess had sent forth her cards for alternate
Thursday evenings of a quasi-literary and scientific character. Lady Mabel was polishing her
poems with serious thoughts of publication, but with strictest secrecy. No one but her parents
and Roderick Vawdrey had been told of these poetic flights. The book would be given to the
world under a nom de plume. Lady Mabel was not so much a Philistine as to suppose that writing
good poetry could be a disgrace to a duke's daughter; but she felt that the house of Ashbourne
would be seriously compromised were the critics to find her guilty of writing doggerel; and
critics are apt to deal harshly with the titled muse. She remembered Brougham's savage onslaught
upon the boy Byron.

Mr. Vawdrey was in town. He rode a good deal in the Row, spent an hour or so daily at Tattersall's,
haunted three or four clubs of a juvenile and frivolous character, drank numerous bottles of
Apolinaris, and found the task of killing time rather hard labour. Of course there were certain
hours in which he was on duty at Kensington. He was expected to eat his luncheon there daily,
to dine when neither he nor the ducal house had any other engagement, and to attend all his
aunt's parties. There was always a place reserved for him at the dinner-table, however middle-aged
and politically or socially important the assembly might me.

He was to be married early in August. Everything was arranged. The honeymoon was to be spent
in Sweden and Norway--the only accessible part of Europe which Lady Mabel had not explored.
They were to see everything remarkable in the two countries, and to do Denmark as well, if
they had time. Lady Mabel was learning Swedish and Norwegian, in order to make the most of
her opportunities.

"It is so wretched to be dependent upon couriers and interpreters," she said. "I shall be a
more useful companion for you, Roderick, if I thoroughly know the language of each country."

"My dear Mabel, you are a most remarkable girl," exclaimed her betrothed admiringly. "If you
go on at this rate, by the time you are forty you will be as great a linguist as Cardinal Wiseman."

"Languages are very easy to learn when one has the habit of studying them, and a slight inclination
for etymology," Lady Mabel replied modestly.

Now that the hour of publication was really drawing nigh, the poetess began to feel the need
of a confidante. The Duchess was admiring but somewhat obtuse, and rarely admired in the right
place. The Duke was out of the question.

If a new Shakespeare had favoured him with the first reading of a tragedy as great as "Hamlet,"
the Duke's thoughts would have wandered off to the impending dearth of guano, or the probable
exhaustion of Suffolk punches, and the famous breed of Chillingham oxen. So, for want of anyone
better, Lady Mabel was constrained to read her verses to her future husband; just as Molière
reads his plays to his housekeeper, for want of any other hearer, the two Béjarts, aunt and
niece, having naturally plays enough and to spare in the theatre.

Now, in this crucial hour of her poetic career, Mabel Ashbourne wanted something more than
a patient listener. She wanted a critic with a fine ear for rhythm and euphony. She wanted
a judge who could nicely weigh the music of a certain combination of syllables, and who could
decide for her when she hesitated between two epithets of equal force, but varying depths of tone.

To this nice task she invited her betrothed sometimes on a sunny April afternoon, when luncheon
was over, and the lovers were free to repair to Lady Mabel's own particular den--an airy room
on an upper floor, with quaint old Queen Anne casements opening upon a balcony crammed with
flowers, and overlooking the umbrageous avenues of Kensington Garden, with a glimpse of the
old red palace in the distance.

Rorie did his best to be useful, and applied himself to his duty with perfect heartiness and
good-temper; but luncheon and the depressing London atmosphere made him sleepy, and he had
sometimes hard work to stifle his yawns, and to keep his eyes open, while Lady Mabel was deep
in the entanglement of lines which soared to the seventh heaven of metaphysics. Unhappily Rorie
knew hardly anything about metaphysics. He had never read Victor Cousin, or any of the great
German lights; and a feeling of despair took possession of him when his sweetheart's poetry
degenerated into diluted Hegelism, or rose to a feeble imitation of Browning's obscurest verse.

"Either I must be intensely stupid or this must be rather difficult to understand," he thought
helplessly, when Mabel had favoured him with the perusal of the first act of a tragedy or poetic
dialogue, in which the hero, a kind of milk-and-watery Faustus, held converse, and argued upon
the deeper questions of life and faith, with a very mild Mephisto.

"I'm afraid you don't like the opening of my 'Tragedy of the Sceptic Soul'," Lady Mabel said
with a somewhat offended air, as she looked up at the close of the act, and saw poor Rorie
gazing at her with watery eyes, and an intensely despondent expression of countenance.

"I'm afraid I'm rather dense this afternoon," he said with hasty apology, "I think your first
act is beautifully written--the lines are full of music; nobody with an ear for euphony could
doubt that; but I--forgive me, I fancy you are sometimes a shade too metaphysical--and those
scientific terms which you occasionally employ, I fear will be a little over the heads of the
general public----"

"My dear Roderick, do you suppose that in an age whose highest characteristic is the rapid
advance of scientific knowledge, there can be anybody so benighted as not to understand the
terminology of science?"

"Perhaps not, dear. I fear I am very much behind the times. I have lived too much in Hampshire.
I frankly confess that some expressions in your--er--Tragedy of--er--Soulless Scept--Sceptic
Soul--were Greek to me."

"Poor dear Roderick, I should hardly take you as the highest example of the Zeitgeist; but
I won't allow you to call yourself stupid. I'm glad you like the swing of the verse. Did it
remind you of any contemporary poet?"

"Well, yes, I think it dimly suggested Browning."

"I am glad of that. I would not for worlds be an imitator; but Browning is my idol among poets."

"Some of his minor pieces are awfully jolly," said the incorrigible Rorie. "That little poem
called 'Youth and Art,' for instance. And 'James Lee's Wife' is rather nice, if one could quite
get at what it means. But I suppose that is too much to expect from any great poet?"

"There are deeper meanings beneath the surface--meanings which require study," replied Mabel
condescendingly. "Those are the religion of poetry----"

"No doubt," assented Rorie hastily; "but frankly, my dear Mabel, if you want your book to be
popular----"

"I don't want my book to be popular. Browning is not popular. If I had wanted to be popular,
I should have worked on a lower level. I would even have stooped to write a novel."

"Well then I will say, if you want your poem to be understood by the average intellect, I really
would sink the scientific terminology, and throw overboard a good deal of the metaphysics.
Byron has not a scientific or technical phrase in all his poems."

"My dear Roderick, you surely would not compare me to Byron, the poet of he Philistines. You
might as well compare me with the author of 'Lalla Rookh,' or advise me to write like Rogers
or Campbell."

"I beg your pardon, my dear Mabel. I'm afraid I must be an out and out Philistine, for to my
mind Byron is the prince of poets. I would rather have written 'The Giaour' than anything that
has ever been published since it appeared."

"My poor Roderick!" exclaimed Mabel, with a pitying sigh. "You might as well say you would
be proud of having written 'The Pickwick Papers'."

"And so I should!" cried Rorie heartily. "I should think no end of myself if I had invented
Winkle. Do you remember his ride from Rochester to Dingley Dell?--one of the finest things
that was ever written."

And this incorrigible young man flung himself back in the low arm-chair, and laughed heartily
at the mere recollection of that episode in the life of the famous Nathaniel. Mabel Ashbourne
closed her manuscript volume with a sigh, and registered an oath that she would never read
any more of her poetry to Roderick Vawdrey. It was quite useless. The poor young man meant
well, but he was incorrigibly stupid--a man who admired Byron and Dickens, and believed Macaulay
the first of historians.

"In the realm of thought we must dwell apart all our lives," Mabel told herself despairingly.

"The horses are ordered for five," she said, as she locked the precious volume in her desk;
"will you get yours and come back for me?"

"I shall be delighted," answered her lover, relieved at being let off so easily.

It was about this time that Lord Mallow, who was working with all his might for the regeneration
of his country, made a great hit in the House by his speech on the Irish land question. He
had been doing wonderful things in Dublin during the winter, holding forth to patriotic assemblies
in the Round Room of the Rotunda, boldly declaring himself a champion of the Home Rulers' cause,
demanding Repeal and nothing but Repeal. He was one of the few Repealers who had a stake in
the country, and who was likely to lose by the disruption of social order. If foolish, he was
at least disinterested, and had the courage of his opinions. This was in the days when Mr.
Gladstone was Prime Minister, and when Irish Radicals looked to him as the one man who could
and would give them Home Rule.

In the House of Commons Lord Mallow was not ashamed to repeat the arguments he had used in
the Round Room. If his language was less vehement at Westminster than it had been in Dublin,
his opinions were no less thorough. He had his party here, as well as on the other side of
the Irish Channel; and his party applauded him. Here was a statesman and a landowner willing
to give an ell, where Mr. Gladstone's Land Act gave only an inch. Hibernian newspapers sung
his praises in glowing words, comparing him to Burke, Curran, and O'Connell. He had for some
time been a small lion at evening parties; he now began to be lionised at serious dinners.
He was thought much of in Carlton Gardens, and his name figured at official banquets in Downing
Street. The Duchess of Dovedale considered it a nice trait in his character that, although
he was so much in request, and worked so hard in the House, he never missed one of her Thursday
evenings. Even when there was an important debate on he would tear up Birdcage Walk in a hansom,
and spend an hour in the Duchess's amber drawing-rooms, enlightening Lady Mabel as to the latest
aspect of the Policy of Conciliation, or standing by the piano while she played Chopin.

Lord Mallow had never forgotten his delight at finding a young lady thoroughly acquainted with
the history of his native land, thoroughly interested in Erin's struggles and Erin's hopes;
a young lady who knew all about the Protestants of Ulster, and what was meant by Fixity of
Tenure. He came to Lady Mabel naturally in his triumphs, and he came to her in his disappointments.
She was pleased and flattered by his faith in her wisdom, and was always ready to lend a gracious
ear. She, whose soul was full of ambition, was deeply interested in the career of an ambitious
young man--a man who had every excuse for being shallow and idle, and yet was neither.

"If Roderick were only like him there would be nothing wanting in my life," she thought regretfully.
"I should have felt much a pride in a husband's fame, I should have worked so gladly to assist
him in his career. The driest blue-books would not have been too weary for me--the dullest
drudgery of parliamentary detail would have been pleasant work, if it could have helped him
in his progress to political distinctions."

One evening, when Mabel and Lord Mallow were standing in the embrasure of a window, walled
in by the crowd of aristocratic nobodies and intellectual eccentricities, talking earnestly
of poor Erin and her chances of ultimate happiness, the lady, almost unawares, quoted a couplet
of her own which seemed peculiarly applicable to the argument.

"Whose lines are those?" Lord Mallow asked eagerly; "I never heard them before."

Mabel blushed like a schoolgirl detected in sending a valentine.

"Upon my soul," cried the Irishman, "I believe they are your own! Yes, I am sure of it. You,
whose mind is so high above the common level, must sometimes express yourself in poetry. They
are yours, are they not?"

"Can you keep a secret?" Lady Mabel asked shyly.

"For you? Yes, on the rack. Wild horses should not tear it out of my heart; boiling lead, falling
on me drop by drop, should not extort it from me."

"The lines are mine. I have written a good deal--in verse. I am going to publish a volume,
anonymously, before the season is over. It is quite a secret. No one--except mamma and papa,
and Mr. Vawdrey--knows anything about it."

"How proud they--now especially proud Mr. Vawdrey must be of your genius," said Lord Mallow.
"What a lucky fellow he is."

He was thinking just at that moment of Violet Tempest, to whose secret preference for Roderick
Vawdrey he attributed his own rejection. And now here--where again he might have found the
fair ideal of his youthful dreams--here where he might have hoped to form an alliance at once
socially and politically advantageous--this young Hampshire's squire was before him.

"I don't think Mr. Vawdrey is particularly interested in my poetical efforts," Lady Mabel said
with assumed carelessness. "He doesn't care for poetry. He likes Byron."

"What an admirable epigram!" cried the Hibernian, to whom flattery was second nature. "I shall
put that down in my commonplace book when I go home. How I wish you would honour me--but it
is to ask too much, perhaps--how proud I should be if you would let me hear, or see, some of
your poems."

"Would you really lik----?" faltered Lady Mabel.

"Like! I should deem it the highest privilege your friendship could vouchsafe."

"If I felt sure it would not bore you, I should like much to have your opinion, your candid
opinion," (Lord Mallow tried to look the essense of candour) "upon some things I have written.
But it would be really to impose too much upon your good-nature."

"It would be to make me the proudest, and--for that one brief hour at least--the happiest of
men," protested Lord Mallow, looking intensely sentimental.

"And you will deal frankly with me? You will not flatter? You will be as severe as an Edinburgh
reviewer?"

"I will be positively brutal," said Lord Mallow. "I will try to imagine myself an elderly feminine
contributor to the 'Saturday,' looking at you with vinegar gaze through a pair of spectacles,
bent upon spotting every fleck and flaw in your work, and predetermined not to see anything
good in it."

"Then I will trust you!" cried Lady Mabel, with a gush. "I have longed for a listener who could
understand and criticise, and who would be too honourable to flatter. I will trust you, as
Marguerite of Valois trusted Clement Marot."

Lord Mallow did not know anything about the French poet and his royal mistress, but he contrived
to look as if he did. And, before he ran away to the House presently, he gave Lady Mabel's
hand a tender little pressure which she accepted in all good faith as a sign manual of the
compact between them.

They met in the Row next morning, and Lord Mallow asked--as earnestly as if the answer involved
vital issues--when he might be permitted to hear those interesting poems.

"Whenever you can spare time to listen," answered Lady Mabel, more flattered by his earnestness
than by all the adulatory nigar-plums which had been showered upon her since her début. "If
you have nothing better to do this afternoon----"

"Could I have anything better to do?"

"We won't enter upon so wide a question," said Lady Mabel, laughing prettily. "If committee-rooms
and public affairs can spare you for an hour or two, come to tea with mamma at five. Ill get
her to deny herself to all the rest of the world, and we can have an undisturbed hour in which
you can deal severely with my poor little efforts."

Thus it happened that, in the sweet spring weather, while Roderick was on the stand at Epsom,
watching the City and Suburban winner pursue his meteor course along the close-cropped sward,
Lord Mallow was sitting at ease in a flowery fauteuil in the Queen Anne morning-room at Kensington,
sipping orange-scented tea out of eggshell porcelain, and listening to Lady Mabel's dulcet
accents, as she somewhat monotonously and inexpressively rehearsed "The Tragedy of a Sceptic Soul."

The poem was long, and, sooth to say, passing dreary; and, much as he admired the Duke's daughter,
there were moments when Lord Mallow felt his eyelids drooping, and heard a buzzing, as of summer
insects, in his ears.

There was no point of interest in all this rhythmical meandering whereon the hapless young
nobleman could fix his attention. Another minute and his sceptic soul would be wandering at
ease in the flowery fields of sleep. He pulled himself together with an effort, just as the
eggshell cup and saucer were slipping from his relaxing grasp. He asked the Duchess for another
cup of that delicious tea. He gazed resolutely at the fair-faced maiden, whose rosy lips moved
graciously, discoursing shallowest platitudes clothed in erudite polysyllables, and then at
the first pause--when Lady Mabel laid down her velvet-bound volume, and looked timidly upward
for his opinion--Lord Mallow poured forth a torrent of eloquence, such as he always had in
stock, and praised "The Sceptic Soul" as no poem and no poet had ever been praised before,
save by Hibernian critic.

The richness, the melody, the depth, colour, brilliance, tone, variety, far-reaching thought,
&c., &c., &c.

He was so grateful to Providence for having escaped falling asleep that he could have gone
on for ever in this strain. But if anyone had asked Lord Mallow what "The Tragedy of a Sceptic
Soul" was about, Lord Mallow would have been spun.

When a strong-minded woman is weak upon one particular point she is apt to be very weak. Lady
Mabel's weakness was to fancy herself a second Browning. She had never yet enjoyed the bliss
of having her own idea of herself confirmed by independent evidence. Her soul thrilled as Lord
Mallow poured forth his praises; talking of "The Book and the Ring," and "Paracelsus," and
a great deal more, of which he knew very little, and seeing in the expression of Lady Mabel's
eyes and mouth that he was saying exactly the right thing, and could hardly say too much.

They were tête-à-tête by this time, for the Duchess was sleeping frankly, her crewel-work drooping
from the hands that lay idle in her lap; her second cup of tea on the table beside her, half-finished.

"I don't know how it is," she was wont to say apologetically, after these placid slumbers.
"There is something in Mabel's voice that always sends me to sleep. Her tones are so musical."

"And do you really advise me to publish?" asked Lady Mabel, fluttered and happy.

"It would be a sin to keep such verses hidden from the world."

"They will be published anonymously, of course. I could not endure to be pointed at as the
author of 'The Sceptic Soul.' To feel that every eye was upon me--at the opera--in the Row--everywhere!
It would be too dreadful. I should be proud to know that I had influenced my age--given a new
bent to thought--but no one must be able to point at me."

"'Thou canst not say I did it,'" quoted Lord Mallow. "I entirely appreciate your feelings.
Publicity of that sort must be revolting to a delicate mind. I should think Byron would have
enjoyed life a great deal better if he had never been known as the author of 'Childe Harold.'
He reduced himself to a social play-actor--and always had to pose in his particular rôle--the
Noble Poet. If Bacon really wrote the plays we call Shakespeare's, and kept the secret all
his life, he was indeed the wisest of mankind."

"You have done nothing but praise me," said Lady Mabel, after a thoughtful pause, during which
she had trifled with the golden clasp of her volume; "I want you to do something more than
that. I want you to advise--to tell me where I am redundant--to point out where I am weak.
I want you to help me in the labour of polishing."

Lord Mallow pulled his whisker doubtfully. This was dreadful. He should have to go into particulars
presently, to say what lines pleased him best, which of the various meters into which the tragedy
was broken up--like a new suburb into squares and crescents and streets--seemed to him happiest
and most original.

"Can you trust me with that precious volume?" he asked. "If you can, I will spend the quiet
hours of the night in pondering over its pages, and will give you the result of my meditations
to-morrow."

Mabel put the book into his hand with a grateful smile.

"Pray be frank with me," she pleaded. "Praise like yours is perilous."

Lord Mallow kissed her hand this time, instead of merely pressing it, and went away radiant,
with the velvet-bound book under his arm.

"She's a sweet girl," he said to himself, as he hailed a cab. "I wish she wasn't engaged to
that Hampshire booby, and I wish she didn't write poetry. Hard that I should have to do the
Hampshire booby's work! If I were to leave this book in a hansom now--there'd be an awful situation!"

Happily for the rising statesman, he was blest with a clever young secretary, who wrote a good
many letters for him, read blue-books, got up statistics, and interviewed obtrusive visitors
from the Green Isle. To this young student Lord Mallow, in strictest secrecy, confided Lady
Mabel's manuscript.

"Read it carefully, Allan, while I'm at the house, and make a note of everything that's bad
on one sheet of paper, and of everything that's good on another. You may just run your pencil
along the margin wherever you think I might write 'divine!' 'grandly original!' 'what pathos!'
or anything of that sort."

The secretary was a conscientious young man, and did his work nobly. He sat far into the small
hours, ploughing through "The Sceptic Soul." It was tough work; but Mr. Allan was Scotch and
dogged, and prided himself upon his critical faculty. This autopsy of a fine lady's poem was
a congenial labour. He scribbled pages of criticism, went into the minutest details of style,
found a great deal to blame and not much to praise, and gave his employer a complete digest
of the poem before breakfast next morning.

Lord Mallow attended the Duchess's kettledrum again that afternoon, and this time he was in
no wise at sea. He handled "The Sceptic Soul" as if every line of it had been engraven on the
tablet of his mind.

"See here now," he cried, turning to a pencilled margin; "I call this a remarkable passage,
yet I think it might be strengthened by some trifling excisions;" and then he showed Lady Mabel
how, by pruning twenty lines off a passage of thirty-one, a much finer effect might be attained.

"And you really think my thought stands out more clearly?" asked Mabel, looking regretfully
at the lines through which Lord Mallow had run his pencil--some of her finest lines.

"I am sure of it. That grand idea of yours was like a star in a hazy sky. We have cleared away
the fog."

Lady Mabel sighed. "To me the meaning of the whole passage seemed so obvious," she said.

"Because it was your own thought. A mother knows her own children however they are dressed."

This second tea-drinking was a very serious affair. Lord Mallow went at the poem like a professional
reviewer, and criticised without mercy, yet contrived not to wound the author's vanity.

"It is because you have real genius that I venture to be brutally candid," he said, when, by
those slap-dash pencil-marks of his--always with the author's consent--he had reduced the "Tragedy
of the Sceptic Soul" to about one-third of its original length. "I was carried away yesterday
by my first impressions; to-day I am coldly critical. I have set my heart upon your poem making
a great success."

This last sentence, freely translated, might be taken to mean: "I should not like such an elegant
young woman to make an utter fool of herself."

Mr. Vawdrey came in while critic and poet were at work, and was told what they were doing.
He evinced no unworthy jealousy, but seemed glad that Lord Mallow should be so useful.

"It's a very fine poem," he said, "but there's too much metaphysics in it. I told Mabel so
the other day. She must alter a good deal of it if she wants to be understanded of the people."

"My dear Roderick, my poem is metaphysical or it is nothing," Mabel answered pettishly.

She could bear criticism from Lord Mallow better than criticism from Roderick. After this it
became an established custom for Lord Mallow to drop in every day to inspect the progress of
Lady Mabel's poems in the course of their preparation for the press. The business part of the
matter had been delegated to him, as much more au fait in such things than homely rustic Rorie.
He chose the publisher and arranged the size of the volume, type, binding, initials, tail-pieces,
every detail. The paper was to be thick and creamy, the type mediaeval, the borders were to
be printed in carmine, the initials and tail-pieces specially drawn and engraved, and as quaint
as the wood-cuts in an old edition of "Le Lutrin." The book was to have red edges, and a smooth
gray linen binding with silver lettering. It was to be altogether a gem of typographic art,
worthy of Firmin Didot.

By the end of May, Lady Mabel's poems were all in type, and there was much discussion about
commas and notes of admiration, syllables too much or too little, in the flowery morning-room
at Kensington, what time Roderick Vawdrey--sorely at a loss for occupation--wasted the summer
hours at races or regattas within easy reach of London, or went to out-of-the-way places, to
look at hunters of wonderful repute, which, on inspection, were generally disappointing.

CHAPTER V.

Crumpled Rose-Leaves.

Violet Tempest had been away from home nearly a year, and to the few old servants remaining
at the Abbey House, and to the villagers who had known and loved her, it seemed as if a light
had gone out.

"It's like it was after the Squire's death, when miss and her ma was away," said one gossip
to another; "the world seems empty."

Mrs. Winstanley and her husband had been living as became people of some pretension to rank
and fashion. They saw very little of each other, but were seen together on all fitting occasions.
The morning service in the little church at Beechdale would not have seemed complete without
those two figures. The faded beauty in trailing silken draperies and diaphanous bonnet, the
slim, well-dressed Captain, with his bronzed face and black whiskers. They were in everybody's
idea the happiest example of married bliss. If the lady's languid loveliness had faded more
within the last year or so than in the ten years that went before it, if her slow step had
grown slower, her white hand more transparent, there were no keen loving eyes to mark the change.

"That affectation of valetudinarianism is growing on Mrs. Winstanley," Mrs. Scobel said one
day to her husband. "It is a pity. I believe the Captain encourages it."

"She has not looked so well since Violet went away," answered the kindly parson. "It seems
an unnatural thing for mother and daughter to be separated."

"I don't know that, dear. The Bible says a man should leave mother and father and cleave to
his wife. Poor Violet was a discordant element in that household. Mrs. Winstanley must feel
much happier now she is away."

"I can't tell how she feels," answered the Vicar doubtfully; "but she does not look so happy
as she did when Violet was at home."

"The fact is she gives way too much," exclaimed active little Mrs. Scobel, who had never given
way in her life. "When she has a head-ache she lies in bed, and has the venetian blinds kept
down, just as if she were dying. No wonder she looks pale and----"

"Etiolated," said the Vicar; "perishing for want of light. But I believe it's moral sunshine
that is wanted there, my dear Fanny, say what you will."

Mr. Scobel was correct in his judgment. Pamela Winstanley was a most unhappy woman--an unhappy
woman without one tangible cause of complaint. True that her daughter was banished; but she
was banished with the mother's full consent. Her personal extravagances had been curtailed;
but she was fain to admit that the curtailment was wise, necessary, and for her own future
benefit. Her husband was all kindness; and surely she could not be angry with him if he seemed
to grow younger every day--rejuvenated by regular habits and rustic life--while in her wan
face the lines of care daily deepened, until it would have needed art far beyond the power
of any modern Medea to conceal Time's ravages. Your modern Medeas are such poor creatures--loathsome
as Horace's Canidia, but without her genius or her power.

"I am getting an old woman," sighed Mrs. Winstanley. "It is lucky I am not without resources
against solitude and age."

Her resources were a tepid appreciation of modern idyllic poetry, as exemplified in the weaker
poems of Tennyson, and the works of Adelaide Proctor and Jean Ingelow, a talent for embroidering
conventional foliage and flowers on kitchen towelling, and for the laborious conversion of
Nottingham braid into Venetian point-lace.

She had taken it into her head of late to withdraw herself altogether from society, save from
such friends who liked her well enough, or were sufficiently perplexed as to the disposal of
their lives, to waste an occasional hour over gossip and orange pekoe. She had now permanently
assumed that rôle of an invalid which she had always somewhat affected.

"I am really not well enough to go to dinner-parties, Conrad," she said, when her husband politely
argued against her refusal of an invitation, with just that mild entreaty which too plainly
means, "I don't care a jot whether you go with me or stay at home."

"But, my dear Pamela, a little gaiety would give you a fillip."

"No, it would not, Conrad. It would worry me to go to Lady Ellangowan's in one of last season's
dresses; and I quite agree with you that I must spend no more money with Theodore."

"Why not wear your black velvet?"

"Too obvious a pis aller. I have not enough diamonds to carry off black velvet."

"But your fine old lace--rose-point, I think you call it--surely that would carry off black
velvet for once in a way."

"My dear Conrad, Lady Ellangowan knows my rose-point by heart. She always compliments me about
it--an artful way of letting me know often she has seen it. 'Oh there is that rose-point of
yours, dear Mrs. Winstanley; it is too lovely.' I know her! No, Conrad; I will not go to the
Ellangowans in a dress made last year; or in any réchauffé of velvet and lace. I hope I have
a proper pride that would always preserve me from humiliation of that kind. Besides, I am not
strong enough to go to parties. You may not believe me, Conrad, but I am really ill."

The Captain put on an unhappy look, and murmured something sympathetic: but he did not believe
in the reality of his wife's ailments. She had played the invalid more or less ever since their
marriage; and he had grown accustomed to the assumption as a part of his wife's daily existence--a
mere idiosyncrasy, like her love of fine dress and strong tea. If at dinner she ate hardly
enough for a bird, he concluded that she had spoiled her appetite at luncheon, or by the consumption
of sweet biscuits and pound-cake at five o'clock. Her refusal of all invitations to dinners
and garden-parties he attributed to her folly about dress, and to that alone. Those other reasons
which she put forward--of weakness, languor, low spirits--were to Captain Winstanley's mind
mere disguises for temper. She had not, in her heart of hearts, forgiven him for closing Madame
Theodore's account.

Thus, wilfully blind to a truth which was soon to become obvious to all the world, he let the
insidious foe steal across his threshold, and guessed not how soon that dark and hidden enemy
was to drive him from the hearth by which he sat, secure in self-approval and sagacious schemes
for the future.

Once a week, through all the long year, there had come a dutiful letter from Violet to her
mother. The letters were often brief--what could the girl find to tell in her desert island?--but
they were always kind, and they were a source of comfort to the mother's empty heart. Mrs.
Winstanley answered unfailingly, and her Jersey letter was one of the chief events of each
week. She was fonder of her daughter at a distance than she had ever been when they were together.
"That will be something to tell Violet," she would say of any inane bit of gossip that was
whispered across the afternoon tea-cups.

CHAPTER VI.

A Fool's Paradise.

At Ashbourne preparations had already begun for the wedding in August. It was to be a wedding
worthy a duke's only daughter, the well-beloved and cherished child of an adoring father and
mother. Kinsfolk and old friends were coming from far and wide to assist at the ceremony, for
whom temporary rooms were to be arranged in all manner of places. The Duchess's exquisite dairy
was to be transformed into a bachelor dormitory. Lodges and gamekeepers' cottages were utilised.
Every nook and corner in the ducal mansion would be full.

"Why not rig up a few hammocks in the nearest pine plantation?" Rorie asked, laughing, when
he heard of all these doings. "One couldn't have a better place to sleep on a sultry summer night."

There was to be a ball for the tenantry in the evening of the wedding-day, in a marquee on
the lawn. The gardens were to be illuminated in a style worthy of the château of Vaux, when
Fouquet was squandering a nation's revenues on lamps and fountains and venal friends. Lady
Mabel protested against all this fuss.

"Dear mamma, I would so much rather have been married quietly,' she said.

"My dearest, it is all your papa's doing. He is so proud of you. And then we have only one
daughter; and she is not likely to be married more than once, I hope. Why should we not have
all our friends round us at such a time?"

Mabel shrugged her shoulders, with an air of repugnance to all the friends and all the fuss.

"Marriage is such a solemn act of one's life," she said. For example, refusing to go to Mass
for the repose of the soul of Schwarzenberg, Bismarck was right:
"He is the man who said," I abuse of Prussia and then delete it.

'"
* * * * *
Â¶ You see, our Otto is one of those Germans uncomfortable in his own incredible personality
expresses the ideal of seriousness National, Otto is terribly seriously
in his cups, or over his half-dozen eggs for breakfast - as you please.

He frightens timid souls.
Â¶ His temperament few men could reduce, much less sit quietly retire
and receive endless bad.

Incident after incident in Frankfurt could be cited, but what's the use?
Â¶ With diabolical Bismarck seriously conspired to break the bones
of two democratic publishers whose writings threw the Prussian mastiff
rips a newspaper black.

Bismarck justifies his cruelty by insisting that "the limits should
be set for these infamous press doodles."

This means that attacks against the divine right of kings who drowned at any cost. He hated the journalists,
the press called "a well poisoned," and as himself, is on record in this regard: "I always went
to the ink bottle very carefully."
Â¶ But mark this: Our Otto, in turn, cleverly used the press to present the smooth side of their
own political intriguing and, in fact he had his press office Prussia of great value, and we have
authority to declare that the idea of Bismarck journalism would be "mercenary scribes well in
hand, men who stabbed as masked murderers and learned as a mob."
Â¶ During the decade we call learning Bismarck, 1851-'61, who was hired by then: 1851, sent
to Frankfurt Diet, 1852, Prussian ambassador in Vienna, during the
illness of Count Arnim, St. Petersburg, 1859, Paris , 1862.

So had the opportunity to become familiar with all major European diplomatic board to study
in their own places, and to perfect his pitch without blackening play with their hands.
Francisco JosÃ© Â¶ Bismarck said: "I am firm to stop attacks against Prussia in the Austrian press!"

This boldness won the Emperor, and in confidence told a friend: "Ah,
that was a man of courage to Bismarck."

Â¶ Also, he said to Joseph: "Prussia never compromise in the question of commercial union with
Austria." 
The emperor said on Bismarck's youth - 37 years - and
I was very impressed. "Bismarck had the wisdom of a 70!" was the comment
of Joseph.

"Those horrid reviewers don't understand her poetry," protested the Duchess, who would have
been hard pushed to comprehend it herself, but who thought it was a critic's business to understand
everything.

"I'm afraid I have written above their heads," Lady Mabel said piteously.

Roderick Vawdrey was worst of all.

"Didn't I tell you 'The Sceptic Soul' was too fine for ordinary intellects, Mab?" he said.
"You lost yourself in an ocean of obscurity. You knew what you meant, but there's no man alive
who could follow you. You ought to have remembered Voltaire's definition of a metaphysical
discussion, a conversation in which the man who is talked to doesn't understand the man who
talks, and the man who talks doesn't understand himself. You must take a simpler subject and
use plainer English if you want to please the multitude."

Mabel had told her lover before that she did not aspire to please the multitude, that she would
have esteemed such cheap and tawdry success a humiliating failure. It was almost better not
to be read at all than to be appreciated only by the average Mudie subscriber. But she would
have liked someone to read her poems. She would have liked critics to praise and understand
her. She would have liked to have her own small world of admirers, an esoteric few, the salt
of the earth, literary Essenes, holding themselves apart from the vulgar herd. It was dreadful
to find herself on a height as lonely as one of those plateaux in the Tyrolean Alps where the
cattle crop a scanty herbage in summer, and where the Ice King reigns alone through the long
winter.

"You are mistaken, Roderick," Mabel said with chilling dignity; "I have friends who can understand
and admire my poetry, incomprehensible and uninteresting as it may be to you."

"Dear Mabel, I never said it was uninteresting," Roderick cried humbly; "everything you do
must be interesting to me. But I frankly own I do not understand your verses as clearly as
I think all verse should be understood. Why should I keep all my frankness till after the first
of August? Why should the lover be less sincere than the husband? I will be truthful even at
the risk of offending you."

"Pray do," cried Mabel, with ill-suppressed irritation. "Sincerity is such a delightful thing.
No doubt my critics are sincere. They give me the honest undisguised truth."

Rorie saw that his betrothed's literary failure was a subject to be carefully avoided in future.

"My poor Vixen," he said to himself, with oh! what deep regret, "perhaps it was not one of
the least of your charms that you never wrote poetry."

Lord Mallow was coming to Ashbourne for the fortnight before the wedding. He had made himself
wondrously agreeable to the Duke, and the Duke had invited him. The House would be up by that
time. It was a delightful season for the Forest. The heather would be in bloom on all the open
heights, the glades of Mark Ash would be a solemn world of greenery and shadow, a delicious
place for picnics, flirtation, and gipsy tea-drinkings. Lord Mallow had only seen the Forest
in the winter. It would be a grand opportunity for him.

He came, and Lady Mabel received him with a sad sweet smile. The reviews had all appeared by
this time: and, except in the West Dulmarsh Gazette and the Ratdiff Highway Register, there
had not been one favourable notice.

"There is a dreadful unanimity about my critics, is there not?" said the stricken poetess,
when she and Lord Mallow found themselves alone together in one of the orchid-houses, breathing
a perfumed atmosphere at eighty degrees, vaporous, balmy, slumberous.

"You have made a tremendous mistake, Lady Mabel," said Lord Mallow.

"How do you mean?"

"You have given the world your great book without first educating your public to receive and
understand it. If Browning had done the same thing--if Browning had burst at once upon the
world with 'The Ring and the Book' he would have been as great a failure as--as--you at present
imagine yourself to be. You should have sent forth something smaller. You should have made
the reading world familiar with a style, too original, and of too large a power and scope,
to please quickly. A volume of ballads and idyls--a short story in simple verse--would have
prepared the way for your dramatic poem. Suppose Goethe had begun his literary career with
the second part of 'Faust'! He was too wise for that, and wrote himself into popularity with
a claptrap novel."

"I could not write a claptrap novel, or claptrap verses," sighed Lady Mabel. "If I cannot soar
above the clouds, I will never spread my poor little wings again."

"Then you must be content to accept your failure as an evidence of the tendencies of an essentially
Philistine age--an age in which people admire Brown, and Jones, and Robinson."

Here Lord Mallow gave a string of names, sacrificing the most famous reputations of the age
to Mabel Ashbourne's vanity.

This brief conversation in the orchid-house was the first healing balm that had been applied
to the bleeding heart of the poetess. She was deeply grateful to Lord Mallow. This was indeed
sympathy. How different from Roderick's clumsy advice and obtrusive affectation of candour.
Mabel determined that she would do her best to make Lord Mallow's visit pleasant. She gave
him a good deal of her society, in fact all she could spare from Roderick, who was not an exacting
lover. They were so soon to be married that really there was no occasion for them to be greedy
of tête-à-tête companionship. They would have enough of each other's company among the Norwegian
fjords.

Lord Mallow did not care about riding under an almost tropical sun, nor did he care to expose
his horse to the exasperating attacks of forest-flies; so he went about with the Duchess and
her daughter in Lady Mabel's pony carriage--he saw schools and cottages--and told the two ladies
all the grand things he meant to do on his Irish estate when he had leisure to do them.

"You must wait till you are married," said the Duchess good-naturedly. "Ladies understand these
details so much better than gentlemen. Mabel more than half planned those cottages you admired
just now. She took the drawings out of the architect's hands, and altered them according to
her own taste."

"And as a natural result, the cottages are perfection!" exclaimed Lord Mallow.

That visit to Ashbourne was one of the most memorable periods in Lord Mallow's life. He was
an impressible young man, and he had been unconsciously falling deeper in love with Lady Mabel
every day during the last three months. Her delicate beauty, her culture, her elegance, her
rank, all charmed and fascinated him; but her sympathy with Erin was irresistible. It was not
the first time that he had been in love, by a great many times. The list of the idols he had
worshipped stretched backwards to the dim remoteness of boyhood. But to-day, awakening all
at once to a keen perception of his hapless state, he told himself that he had never loved
before as he loved now.

He had been hard hit by Miss Tempest. Yes, he acknowledged that past weakness. He had thought
her fairest and most delightful among women, and he had left the Abbey House dejected and undone.
But he had quickly recovered from the brief fever: and now, reverentially admiring Lady Mabel's
prim propriety, he wondered that he could have ever seriously offered himself to a girl of
Vixen's undisciplined and unbroken character.

"I should have been a miserable man by this time if she had accepted me," he thought. "She
did not care a straw about the People of Ireland."

He was deeply, hopelessly, irrecoverably in love; and the lady he loved was to be married to
another man in less than a week. The situation was too awful. What could such a woman as Mabel
Ashbourne see in such a man as Roderick Vawdrey. Michael loved his son Luke just slightly more
than he loved his home and property that he had himself built. Hen wanted to bequeath it, free
and clear, to his son upon his death. As Wordsworth wrote to Poole, he stated, "I tried to portray
a hearty, down-to-earth man being torn by his love for his children and his love for his labor
of love-the land upon which he calls his home, the ultimate symbol of family individuality.

at the end of the line. Notice the run-on sentences. A woman who could
read Euripides, who knew all that was best in modern literature, was a woman for a husband
to be proud of.

In this desperate and for the most part unsuspected condition of mind, Lord Mallow hung upon
Lady Mabel's footsteps during the days immediately before the wedding. Roderick was superintending
the alterations at Briarwood, which were being carried on upon rather an extravagant scale,
to make the mansion worthy of the bride. Lord Mallow was always at hand, in the orchid-houses,
carrying scissors and adjusting the hose, in the library, in the gardens, in the boudoir. He
was drinking greedily of the sweet poison. This fool's paradise of a few days must end in darkness,
desolation, despair--everything dreadful beginning with d; but the paradise was so delicious
an abode that although an angel with a flaming sword, in the shape of conscience, was always
standing at the gate, Lord Mallow would not be thrust out. He remained; in defiance of conscience,
and honour, and all those good sentiments that should have counselled his speedy departure.

CHAPTER VII.

"It might have been."

"They are the most curious pair of lovers I ever saw in my life," said one of the visitors
at Ashbourne, a young lady who had been engaged to be married more than once, and might fairly
consider herself an authority upon such matters. The leader of Pegu as well as the rulers of Siam and Ava dominate
the most extraordinary rubies.

The king of Pegu owns the finest of these rare rubies. Its exquisite nature has been placed into
a wise saying.

When its value is compared to gold, the worth of this ruby is incalculable.


The speakers were a party of young ladies, who were getting through an idle hour after breakfast
in the billiard-room.

"Lady Mabel is just the sort of girl no man could be desperately in love with," said another. (P.
118) found a 60deg. in August, even at Boma during dewy nights. The lowest water temperature
was 75deg, and. Most 79deg., While the mouth is sometimes 83deg.,
Tuckey gives 76deg.-77deg., 74deg. up and over the Niagara River,
and 73deg. where there are limestone springs.

Oxydization iron suddenly ceased after one day of drying, the plants were ready for a trip
to England, and meat wrill hard to keep one day in the lowlands is
here eatable on the fifth.

While the focus of "indent" has been discussed in my hammock I set
to visit a market share quitanda or hard.

As I started, women sang
"Lungwa U Ko Ko telemene Mwanza a kwenda Yell."
"The boat arriving at Mwanza (River) same goes to Yell" (rapids). It is part of a chant which
the mothers of men now old taught them in childhood, and only reminiscence of the Congo Expedition,
whose double boats, Ajojos Brazil, struck their rude minds half a century ago.
These quitandas are frequented by people living on dozens of miles, and give names of days, which
consequently everywhere vary.

Thus, Boma Friday, Saturday, Sunday and Monday, respectively, are called "Nkenge", "Sona", "Kandu,"
and "Konzo." This style of dividing time, which is common throughout the infidel West Africa,
style is usually a week: so Proyart Loango Abbe tells us that week
is four days, and that the fourth men "rest" by hunting and going
to market.

Tuckey also recognizes the Week "four days" as opposed to weeks of
seven days of the Gold Coast.

After a half hour run northwest carry my strong growth shouting "semper et al oh!" dotted in
the market place about a hundred souls were assembled. 'Do
you think I would go through this labour,' he says, 'if you were not to halve this success? If
we feel that our case requires it we should not feel reluctant to
follow such distinguished authorities.

Looking back at our earlier statements we can see that they are not
materially different from the results of our latest investigations.

Three hours later Lord Mallow and Lady Mabel met by accident in the garden. It was an afternoon
of breathless heat and golden sunlight, the blue ether without a cloud--a day on which the
most restless spirit might be content to yield to the drowsiness of the atmosphere, and lie
at ease upon the sunburnt grass and bask in the glory of summer. Lord Mallow had never felt
so idle, in the whole course of his vigorous young life.

"I don't know what has come to me," he said to himself; "I can't settle to any kind of work;
and I don't care a straw for sight-seeing with a pack of nonentities." 

As soon as the business partner manager gets married, her horizons will be broadened and her selflessness
will be more obvious. She is always planning and managing the events of the people around her
instead of focusing on her own life. Her house is a mess, her children and her own needs are
neglected because she is always doing things for her neighbors instead.
 

All through the night, it raged over land and water, increasing to a gale as dawn broke, lashing
the lake into a plate of foam, and getting colder and colder as the soaring water-filled clouds
obscured the sun and the bleak day waxed and waned. It was not very
old timber, but it was sufficiently umbrageous. They have merged together into something that
seems to be permanent after for nearly fifty years their work separately.
In the village, in a bleak Lanarkshire factory, in the south of Scotland,
Robert Owen, millowner, socialist and Welshman, found that unless
he could provide for the education of the children of his factory
hands, no parents would consent to settle in the district and he would
be without workers in his mill.

But Owen found himself, as a consequence, in the position of education authority, privy purse
and organiser. He did not flinch from the situation and he imposed on cheap makeshift. He
did it because he believed in education as an end and not as an economic means. A twofold institution
was therefore established by him in 1816. One fold was for the children of recognised school
age, presumably over six, and other one for those under school age, whose only entrance test
was their ability to walk. The concern is with the latter.
Owen gave instructions to the man and the women, whom he chose for his Infant School, may serve
to show his general aim.

His aim was that the babies under their care were above all to be happy, to lead a natural
life, outdoor or indoor as weather permitted, learning their surroundings, playing, singing,
dancing etc. He made it sure that no book should annoy the babies
and not shadowed by the needs of the upper school but living the life
their age demanded.

In the light of the 1918 Education Bill this seems almost prophetic.

Owen selected the guardians solely on the grounds of personality and
expected to work in the spirit in which he conceived the school.

They were gentle, without personal ambition, fond of children, caring
only for their welfare.

But the sole guiding principle was Owen, and this was at once the
success and doom of the school.

The personality of Owen was thus made the pivot found which the school
revolved.

There was nothing to take hold of without him.
The persons with the stamp of authority came to see the school after
Owen's experiment became known.

Even official hearts were moved by the reality of the children's happiness and their consequent
development. The visitors felt, rather than knew, that the thing was right. Similar institutions
were established in London and after one or two experiments, a permanent one was founded which
was under the control of a man named Wilderspin.

Wilderspin's contribution to education is difficult to estimate as
certainly he never caught Owen's spirit or realised his simple purpose.

Wilderspin had ambitions reaching beyond the happiness of the children,
and far from trying to make their education suit their stage of growth.

He ought to produce the "Infant Prodigy," just as a contemporary of
his sought to produce the "Infant Saint."

From this one can see that his aim was what he honestly believed to be right as far as his light
went. But he sought for no light beyond his own and outlook was not so narrow as his application was
unintelligent

.
 I do not hesitate to avow that in nature, as interpreted by binocular vision, these points
only approximately, flow into one. Otherwise one eye would be as effective as two.
I have no objection to my views being considered "false to art," since
her fidelity to nature is beyond suspicion.

As to the model-like appearance of stereographs taken, I refer the objector to most of the
beautiful foreign views now so abundant in our opticians' shops.

Is it not palpable that increasing the width of the eyes is analogous
to decreasing the size of the object?

As if naturally we cannot perceive at one view three sides of a cake, two heads of a drum, nor
any other like absurdity. It is only because we do not use objects sufficiently small.I have
before me a small rectangular inkholder about 1Â¼ inches square, and distant from my eyes about
one foot, in which the very absurd phenomenon complained of does exist, the front, top, and
both sides being perfectly visible at once. One of those stubborn fellows may find me as cannot
be corrected, on the points on which your correspondent has so kindly tried to enlighten me.

To introduce Clouds (Vol. viii., p. 451.) as desired by your correspondent
[Greek: S]., the negative must be treated in the sky by solution of
cyanide of potassium laid on in the form desired with a camel's hair
pencil.

This discharges a portion of the reduced silver, and allows the light
to penetrate.

Great care required to stop the action by well washing in water. White clouds are produced
by painting them in with a black pigment mixed in size.

Death of Edward II. (Vol. viii., p. 387.).--P. C. S. S. has noticed with surprise the very strange
assertion of MR. C. M. INGLEBY with reference to the murder of Edward
II. at Berkeley Castle, viz. that "Echard and Rapin are silent, both
as to the event and the locality."

If MR. INGLEBY will again refer to Echard (vol. i. p. 341., edit. 1718) and to Rapin (vol. iii.
p. 147., edit. 1749), he will perceive that the two historians record
"both the event and the locality."

MR. INGLEBY did not perhaps consider that the transaction in question took place during the reign
of Edward III, and not to be sought for at the close of that of Edward
II.

(where probably MR. C. M. INGLEBY looked for it), but among the occurrences in the time of
Edward III. MR. C. M. INGLEBY will surely find it in every other History of England since
the date of the "event", not only in Echard and Rapin.

your correspondent J. G. FITCH used an inappropriate a synonym for Martin Luther as "the great Iconoclast?"--
An occasional contributor wished the Editor to note down this Query
that was there any historical evidence for Luther's breaking a single
image.

Luther no Iconoclast (Vol. viii., p. 335.).

It is not to defend Luther but to point out a defect in his teaching, as it is regarded by the
adherents of other Protestant churches, that Dr. Maclaine has said, in his note on Book IV. ch. i.
Â§ 18. of Mosheim:
"It is evident, from several passages in the writings of Luther, that he was not averse to the
use of images, on the contrary looked upon them as adapted to excite
and animate the devotion of the people."

Mosheim and Merle D'AubignÃ©, or other historians of the Reformation
in Germany, witnesses for the notorious fact, that Carlstadt excited
the citizens of Wittemberg to break the images in their churches when
Luther was concealed in the Castle of Wartburg.

He rebuked and checked these proceedings on his return.

Rev. Urban Vigors (Vol. viii., p. 340.).--My great-great-grandmother was a sister of Bishop Vigors, consecrated
to the see of Leighlin and Ferns, March 8, 1690.

He, I know, was a near relative of the Rev. Urban Vigors. An Urban Vigors of Ballycormack,
co. Wexford, also married my great-great-aunt, a Miss Thomas, sister of Vigors Thomas, Esq., of
Limerick. The likely result would
be that Catholics would relegate him as a heretic, while Protestants would name him an anti-Buonapartist.
He would find himself shuffled between the two, continually in limbo.
 

I tell you, is a hard can it be called off as the Aetna. But nature must take its course: the

"  "Come," said Ganymede ", this sermon is but his subtlety to lie still in bed, either because
you think the cold morning, or what has been, I would steal a nap: this change Palm has not,
and therefore upward and outward.

And with that she put on her skirt, and start-up, and as soon as she had been ready and have breakfast,
go far in these two with his bag and bottles to the field, in the most pleasant contents of the
mind they never were in the court of Torismond.
They arrived almost as soon as the folds, but can see that their unhappy forester was walking
in his melancholy.

Aliena As soon as he saw it, smiled and told Ganymede:  
"Wipe
your eyes, baby, there's your partner this morning in deep prayer,
no doubt, to Venus, she can do as unfortunate as he is passionate.

Come on, Ganymede, I beg you, let's have some sports with him. "
"Content" said Ganymede, and thus to awaken from its deep memory, [1] began as follows:
[Note 1: Dream.]
"Forester, sort of your thoughts, and provide your passions.

What makes you so early this morning in a foreign country?

In contemplation, no doubt, his Rosalynd. Look, forestry, not too far, the pass can be profound
, and slip on shoes: I tell you, the flies have the spleen, cholera ants, the shadows, the less
hair, and loves a great desire smaller.

It's good, forest, love, but not Overlove, lest in love like you do not have time to yourself
in an endless maze. "

Rosader, and the pastor very blond and her lover with whom he felt greater ease of care, they returned
the greeting in this way:
"Gentle Shepherd, all hail, and healthier than their flocks as you happy in your content. Love
is restless, and my bed is just my cell destruction, because we have to find thoughts and broken
dreams employed: here (despite passionate everywhere), but I love the stream with more patience,
as each object feeds my eyes with a variety of fantasies. When I look at the beautiful tapestry
Flora, checked with the pride of all her treasure, I call to mind the beautiful face whose
heavenly hue Rosalynd exceeds the rose and lily for the most excellence: the brightness of
the brightness of Phoebus leaves me in the mind to think of the bright
flames that flew from her eyes, and establish for the first time in
my heart the fire: the sweet harmony of birds, makes me remember the
melody of his voice rare, like the siren enchanteth the listener's
ears.

Thus in contemplation I save my sorrows, with the implementation of the perfection of each object
to the excellence of his qualities. "
"She is facing a lot to you," Aliena said, "and so, so many times I've wanted for myself, that
if one day would be as loving as Oenone, I could find as faithful as you love Paris same. "

"How do you say about this topic, forestry?" Ganymede said, "that favors fair shepherdess, who owns
many herds. It leaves out, man, the assumption is Rosalynd love, seeing in it when I rove beyond
the moon, and cast a look at my wife, which is certainly just as
real but not as a bird in hand is worth only two in the forest: better
feel the love of Aliena that obtained in the shadow fury Rosalynd.

"
"I'll tell you boy," said Rosader, "so my fantasy is staring at my Rosalynd, who were your mistress
as fair Leda and Danae, who courted Zeus transformed in ways, my eyes do not guarantee to entertain
their beauty; and so has love locked me in his perfections, which took place only contemplate
in its beauty, the absolute excellence have any other. "
"Venus is the culprit, forestry, if having such a true servant of you, you with no reward Rosalynd
if Rosalynd were more fair than she. But leaving this talk, now I'm going to put in the mind
of his promise about the sonnets, you said in your own home in the hostel. "
 

They are not in a position to, as much for embarrassment, for their

I cannot go on,--coercing me to resign--"

 An abnormal
blitz of business just again advancing in to him, and the editor acute for copy, Lewin begged
me to address the Article myself, to which I a lot of cautiously
assented; absolute about to be absolutely impartial.

The aftereffect was that if I handed the appraisal to my active friend, he bound said afterwards
a abrupt glance, "Why, this will not do at all; you accept cut yourself
up cruelly, instead of praising, as you care to accept done.

I have to do it myself, I suppose. Here, archetype out this Opinion for me, if you can apprehend
it: it's Mr. Brodie's, and I can't."

With that he threw my MS. into the wastepaper basket, and I did his plan for him, whilst he commended
me with due vigour, and beatific his agent off with a too affectionate adjudication in hot alacrity
to the alert editor.
The acknowledgment of Brodie reminds me that I spent a year artful old accomplishments in his
black chamber, 49 Lincoln's Inn Fields, area cipher could apprehend his autography except his agent
(appropriately yclept Inkpen), and if he couldn't it was handed aback to Mr. Brodie for exposition,
wherein if he himself failed, as was sometimes the case, he had to
address a new Opinion.

Inkpen was a character, as a self-taught entomologist, ancestry in me again the rabies of
accession moths and beetles, as a brace of boxes abounding of such can still prove. He lived
at Chelsea, abreast the Botanical Gardens there; and attributed his admirable finds of aberrant
insects in his own pocket-handkerchief garden to devious caterpillars and flies, &c., that

The lake water differs in its colors from mesmerizing green to an ocean blue, and they are packed
with different kinds of fish.

Many islands are placed about the lake, they differ in terrains from low and green, to rocky
and rising precipitately to heights directly up from the water.

The edge of the lake is mostly rocky. The landscape around Lake Superior
is breath-takingly beautiful.

The walls of red sandstone on the south coast are famous among visitors.

They were described in earlier accounts as the "Pictured Rocks."

They are across from the greatest width of the lake and they are
exposed to the biggest force of the torrential storms from the north.

Their weird shape is brought on from the effects of the waves upon
them and the sand from their disintegration is blown down the coast
below and raised by the winds into the long lines of sandy cliffs.

At Grand Sable, they are one hundred to three hundred feet high,
and consists of hills of blowing sand.

In the middle of the lake, Keweenaw Point stretches out in the water. Here the steamer halted for
wood. We arrived on the shore in a gorgeous grove. "What a place for a dinner!" cried one person
in the party.

"Glorious! Glorious!" chimed in a dozen more voices.
"How long has the boat to wait?" asked Hugh.
"One hour," said the weather-beaten son of Neptune.

"That gives us plenty of time," was the general verdict. Lunch-baskets were brought ashore.
The steamer's steward was prevailed upon, a silver dollar into his
hand, to help us, and presently the entire party feasted by the lakeside.

That grove was a true royal dining-room, its outer pillars rising from the lake, its brown floor
of pine-needles, arabesqued with a slight tracery of the sun shadows and floating leaves, and
giving through the true Gothic arches of its myriad window glorious views of the lake that lay
like an enchanted sea before us! And whoever dined more regally than us though upon nectar and
ambrosia, than our merry-makers as they sat at their well-spread board, with such glowing pictures
before their dimly lit eyes, such balmy airs fluttering about their blissful heads, and such
music as the sunshiny waves made in their awaiting, listening ears?
 

These drain pipes are made of wood in short lengths, reinforced tested

The entire building is ventilated by a character or a fan in the basement, and a fan in the

The fan is in the middle of the building placed on the ground floor
and 100 mm in diameter.

Its capacity is 30,000 cubic meters. Feet of air per minute.

And forces the air through a series of tubes, placed in folders in
each laboratory.

Steam and internal combustion tests .-- The studies included under the term of fuel consumption,
related to the use of different types of fuels from coal and oil, and relate mainly to the combustion
of these fuels in producing gas in furnaces of steam boilers, engines,
etc . and with the efficiency and the use of oil, kerosene, gasoline,
etc., in internal combustion engines.

This work is under the general direction of Mr. RL Fernald and is
mainly produced in the building No. 13 (Plate XVII) and 21 
bought
to test the combustion of fuels by the government, is the team of
two boilers with water tubes Heine, each composed of 210 hp, a system
in the building No. 13.

One of these is a boiler plate or a fireman equipped and Jones combined
on a regular basis.

At four points in the configuration of the large pipes were in the
brick wall, the explanations can build on the temperature of the gas
and gas samples for chemical analysis.

The other boiler grid is set with a hand plane fired. It amazed step for the gas (Fig. 15).
Thanks to this portion of the caldera in the back, remove the gas, the length of the combustion chamber
(Plate XVIII) and the same course as the hand-fire grill.

Both run the grid and the manual feed combustion chamber for a long
period in parallel, but it is expected that typically only one is
running.

A forced draft fan is on one side of the boiler feed water source will be installed to provide
air when coal is burned to its maximum capacity. This fan is also connected to supply air
into the combustion chamber at any length. A more detailed description of the boiler is in vocational
No  Because of the distance from the building No. 21 of the main group of buildings, it was
appropriate to try to steam the construction of Building No. 13 No. 21 to make, whether for
heating or electricity.

Taking into account also the need for different types and sizes of boilers for heating at
home because of evidence that have been through this in the context
of these investigations made to install, it was decided to install
this boiler on the ground floor of the building No. 21, where they
could be used not just to make the necessary evidence, but are in
the heat and steam for the construction and chemical laboratories.

In addition to the physics lab on the ground floor of the building No. 21 in the boiler and heating
with coal storage requirements, there are rooms dedicated to storage of supplies heavy samples
fuels and oils and various commercial aircraft.

One room is occupied by the fan and used a chopper to be necessary, roll, screen, etc., necessary,
as part of the coal sample prior to analysis

When they begun, they did not know each other; but now that they were nearing the end of the
journey they were talking enjoyably together at present. It was obvious that the little Old Lady
hailed from the country; she had an elegantly neat and austere appearance; in a city brought up
the air of decorum about her is usually missing. She brought with her a big bunch of hedgerow
flowers. She showed a little nervousness during the travel, and about encountering the noise
and confusion of the great city, she was even more so. The Stockbroker and Curate had to answer
many of her questions which were about the places she had to see,
and what should be the payment to the cabman, and about the best shops
in the city.

 Totally twenty three battles wit
his guns have created an extra ordinary record in Cuba. Once he was captured by his opponent and
after trial he was sentenced to death, he has been suddenly escaped from his punishment brilliantly.
Then after sometimes, steel tipped Mauser bullet had been injured his lungs severely. After
healing so such injury, he was continuously suffered from fever and he had been compelled to
go back United States. Even though he was planned to go to Cuba, the Maine was blown up and
he had been forced to wait for his war with Spain for sometime.

Governor Leedy of Kansas made a mail to him and then he was appointed
as a Colonel of the twentieth Kansas.

Then he went with General Miles to Cuba in June 1898 and he had been
sailed with his total battle force for Manila in October 1898.

But three years before he started to Manila in October, Colonel Funston
met Miss. Ella Blankhart of Oakland.

Due to his over love with her as his anxiety on war, he encouraged
his love and he got married before the day to sail.

On behalf of his daring risks and achievements in the Philippines and due to his capture
of Aguinaldo, the general publics have become so familiar with him. So he had not been compelled people
to surrender.

As a brave and a fighting man, he was well qualified for his bravery deeds and he was also pure
and simple in all aspects. There are two opinions which were on his personality. First one is
according to General Harrison.

G. Otis, âFunston is the greatest daredevil and very brave in the
army and he will always like to fight than eat.

There is no one person I saw in this world who enjoyed fighting in
the army so much.

According to the opinion of his another friend, he was a sixteenth century hero and born four hundred
years or so too late. In his service he had been ever seeking to remedy the chronological error
of his birth. Golden Gate Park was the Mecca of the poverty. There the immense playground of the
municipality has become and changed as a vast mushroom city and they resembled as the fleeting
towns located on the border of a government reservation about to be opened to public settlement.
A week before kitchen utensils has been considered as cheapest things against their high value.
 [Footnote 1: Freon was eminent journalist
of the last century: his criticisms procured him many powerful enemies, among whom was Voltaire.}

Of the purchase of Ferney, Voltaire thus speaks in his memoirs:--
"I bought, by a very singular kind of contract, of which there was no example in that country,
a small estate of about sixty acres, which they sold me for about twice as much as it would
have cost me at Paris; but pleasure is never too dear. The house was pretty and commodious, and
the prospect charming; it astonishes without tiring: on one side
is the lake of Geneva, and the city on the other.

The Rhone rushes from the former with vast impetuosity, forming a canal at the bottom of my
garden, whence is seen the Arve descending from the Savoy mountains, and precipitating itself
into the Rhone, and farther still another river. A hundred country seats, a hundred delightful
gardens, ornament the borders of the lakes and rivers. The Alps at a great distance rise and
terminate the horizon, and among the distance rise and terminate the horizon, and among their
prodigious precipices, twenty leagues extent of mountain are beheld covered with eternal snows."

Upon Voltaire's settlement at Ferney, the country was almost a savage desert. The village contained
but fifty inhabitants, but became by the poet's means the residence of 1,200 persons, among
which were a great number of artist, principally watch makers, who
established their manufacture under his auspices, and exported their
labours throughout the continent Certified checks were not required on these later bids.
All bidders showing a disposition to bid for right, title, and interest of the Exposition Company
to all salvage except as stated were treated alike. The negotiations were carried on verbally
with the bidders in turn, it being understood that the company would
demand upon what it estimated to be an adequate cash payment when
the contract of sale was finalized.

The secretary of the company is granted permission to say that the executive committee courts
the fullest examination of all circumstances connected with the sale of the salvage and that if
the National Commission shall reason it necessary to include in its report mention of the allegations
contained in the letter of the president of the Commission, dated February 28, the committee requests
that in justice to the Exposition Company such investigation shall be made and the conclusions
of the Commission shall be offered.  Very respectfully, WALTER B.
STEVENS, Secretary.

Mr. LAURENCE H. GRAHAME, Secretary National Commission, Washington, D.C.  Another communication
bearing on the disposition of the salvage was received from Mr. Stevens:  MARCH 23, 1905.  DEAR
SIR: At a meeting of the National Commission on the 20th the suggestion was offered by a member
of the Commission that the answer to allegation third did not fully cover the ground.  The
purpose was to answer that no higher bid than the Chicago House Wrecking Companyâs was received
either before; at the time, or after the sum of $450,000 had been deemed to be recommended by
the committee on salvage.  On the 30th of November, early in the day, the Chicago House Wrecking
Company offered a bid for $420,000. The next highest bid was under $400,000. Late in the day,
the 30th of November, the salvage committee, after conference with all bidders who made offeres,
made the proposition to the Chicago House Wrecking Company that if
it would raise its bid from $420,000 to $450,000 the committee would
recommend acceptance by the executive committee.

Under the act of Congress the Commission had no authority to undertake a thorough investigation
of the charges and allegations brought in respect to the manner in which the salvage of the exposition
had been disposed of.

With no authority to send for persons and papers, to administer oaths, or to compel witnesses
to testify, any further attempt upon the part of the Commission to
inquire into the salvage matter would have been out of jurisdiction.

If any further action is to be taken to ascertain whether or not the financial interest of
the United States has been sacrificed by the manner in which the salvage was disposed of, the
inquiry must be conducted by some committee or official having these powers, which the Commission
does not have.  A careful perusal of the law under which the Commission was given will show
the narrow scope of its legal limits, and the records disclose the
policy of the Exposition Company not only to confine the Commission
strictly within the narrowest limits of the law, but also to question
and resist the exercise of its power in many instances where the law
seemed to place such authority beyond reasonable doubt.

 Nae sooner,
then, had he got the tell, than he unsealed it out, and lookit at it wi' his wee glowrin', discontented
een, as if to see that it wasna a forgery. He then shook his brain equivalent a theologiser,
when he's no real sure what's wrang wi' a somebody, but wants to mak' it materialize that he kens
a' about it--and continuing in this name exchequer the Heelandman's forbearance began to get
tired.
"Can ye no alter the tone, old shentleman?" quo' Donald.

Prying gi'ed his educator anither excite, and looked especial owlish.
"Is the tell no goot, sir?"' spak the Heelandman, a gear experience; but the cratur, instead of responsive
him, exclusive gi'ed anither of his advisable shakes, as such as to say, "I'm no really trustworthy
near it." At this Donald mislaid normalize. "If the billet doesna delight ye, sir," quo' he, "I'll
convey ye to gie me it place again, and I'll gang to several ither situation." And he stretchit
out his aid to tak transfer o't, when my frien' wi' the appendage, lifting up his adopt, lent
him sic a wallop ower the fingers as prefab him pu' support in the twinkling of an ee.
"Got tamn ye, ye auld scounrel," said the man; "do ye average to tak my money frae me?" And
he lifted up a stave big eneuch to seam a stot, and let lam at the monkey; but Snoopy was
ower quick for him, and actuation message, he lichted on a ridge
before ane could say Contestant Historian.

Here he rowed up the greenback equivalent a baw in his assemblage, and put it into his cover pouch
equivalent any thinking cratur. Not exclusive this, but he mockit the Heelandman by a' sort
of capital, shot out his projection at him, expulsion at him, and girning at him wi' his foreclose
outlandish face. Then he would tak haud of his spy in his twa keeping, and wag it at Donald,
and steeking his nieves, he would seem to threaten him wi' a leatherin'. A'thegither he was fearless
impudent, and eneuch to try the forbearance of a saunt, no to spak o' a het-bluided Heelandman.
It was gude for sair een to see how Donald behavit on this function.

He raged equivalent ane demented, misca'ing the monkey beyond instrument, and swearing as mony
Celtic aiths as micht hae sair'd an ordinar man for a twalmonth. During this case, I never
sterr'd a beat, but keepit keeking frae the hindermost goldbrick measure, in comes Mr. Yarn
wi' a tack of lowing cover in his assemblage that he had got frae the incoming entry to licht the
seek; and nae sooner did Donald see him than he ax'd him for his notation.

"What commentary, truthful man?" said Mr. Filling.
"Got tamn," quo' Donald; "the note the auld scounrel, your granddad, stole frae me."
"My grandfaither!" answered the ither wi' feeling. "I am thinking, square man, ye hae had a glassful
ower muckle. My grandfaither has been barren for saxteen age, and
I ne'er heard say soil now that he was a acres."

"Weel, weel, then," quo' the Heelandman, "I don't care naething most it. If he's no your grandfaither,
he'll be your faither, or your brither, or your relative."
"My faither or my brither, or my cousin!" repeated Mr. Pick. "I maun avow ye plainly, frien', that
I hae neither faither, nor brither, nor relation of ony statement
on this lateral of the inscribe.

I dinna interpret ye, honest man, but I judge that ye hae sat ower

At this module the Heelandman people a' cards, and lookit sae awful fairce, that ance or twice
I was on the cutting of upcoming forrit, and explaining how matters real stood; but oddment
keepit me chained to the approve class, and I honorable thocht I would bide a wee, and see how
the affaire was same to end.

"Pray, wha are you, sir?" said Donald, putting his keeping in his
sides, and looking finished his specks upon Mr. Weft, like a deevil
incarnit. "Wha are you, sir, that daar to utter to me in this demeanour?"
 Even looking forward to the future--when she would be of age and

applies to the position of Ujiji; however, the differences are so
minuscule that it would require the usage of a microscope in order
to detect them on the map.]

 The
note of question was listened with equivocal clearness by both Homer and Wordsworth. And indeed,
there are not a multitude of poets from any age or country who have not had the personal anecdote
of their own ears as to its character. Therefore, why is there a difference in perspective?

We might talk a little longer in this same vein. We may also bestow the mythological origin assigned
for the attributed sadness, and add that some, not happy with this,
symbolize the bird as angling its bosom, against a thorn--

'To irritate
the inner turmoil, Which makes its sweet music so somber.'

But we
prefer pause to confess frankly, that two of the witnesses listed
above may be challenged--Virgil and Thomson; who should not be counted
separately but as one, for the author of the Seasons.

In the lines listed, has translated, though not so as diligent as Dryden, from the Georgics
of the Latin poet. If you read this passage--it does not matter whether in Virgil, Dryden, or Thomson--you
will notice that it is an exceptional occurrence that is talked about: no resolution whatever is made as
to the distinctness of the nightingale's simple song. Thomson, in the course of his altruistic
and caring objection against the savage art: 'through which birds are

--by dictator man Inhuman caught, and in the tight cage From freedom constricted, and limitless
air,'

represents the nightingale's agony when thus stripped. These lines will stand whole; we are
positive no one would wish to tinker with the passage.

'But chief, do not let the nightingale cry Her inadequate care, too beautifully framed To brook
the coarse restrictions of the cage. Oft, when returning with her
loaded bill, The surprised mother finds a empty nest, By the impolite
hands of incessant clowns Stolen: to the earth the futile provision
falls. You can see connecting

Few object fourth-year men hit the temerity to communicate him as "Parsons" to his present;
it seems much an reverent target to do, equivalent holding a chapel in bedroom slippers or close
arm-in-arm with a Dispiriting.

You reason unwieldy nearly it.  In ordination to give you a shadowy idea of Parsons' impressiveness
I staleness listen aft for a point to a predestined day in Nov, 1914, when Biffin and I, after
a short delay with the C.U.O.T.C., port City to connect our regiments.

It was pouring with succession, but we were joyful in ambiance; we had our commissions; things were
deed to hap; we mat virtually in individual to force a officer. As we passed out finished
the author's abode Parsons sat at his fare, imperturbable and nonindulgent,
his eagle eyes experience from beneath his bushy brows and his venerable
fiber indiscriminate his titty.

At that minute Biffin, agitated with fervor, forgot himself.
"Cheerio, Sociologist, old favour," he loud wildly; "how's the endure check your whiskers?"

Then, realising the indecency of his act, he upturned dead discolour, dashed out into the route
and dived panic-stricken into the ready taxi. We prefabricated serious our recreation.

Having been demobilised at a relatively aboriginal appointment, out of politeness for our crucial
intellects, Biffin and I were sure for Cambridge, to know up the threads of acquisition where WILHELM
had snapped them several years previously. Both of us hold denatured a slight. Biffin has been
burnt brownness by the suns of Empire, piece I crumble a moderate
souvenir of Flanders on my speed lip.

"I ponder if Parsons present mention us," said Biffin as the educate thundered into the send.

"Of way he faculty," I replied.

"Sociologist never forgets anything."
"I uncertainty it," said Biffin.

A concentrated glimpse of Parsons, stagnant standing in all his conventional
beauty, showed up group equivalent Mr. H.G. WELLS in their apodictic
appearance in a present.

It did one superior.
We approached him. "Suitable farewell, Sociologist," we said, with a gritty try at sang-froid.

Sociologist regarded us. "Healthy farewell, Mr. Jones," he said to me. Then his eyes unwearied on Biffin.
"Honorable greeting, Sir," he said.

Biffin nudged me, "He's forgotten me," he whispered. Sociologist continued to somebody him to
an inexorable scrutiny. At length he crosspiece again. "As to your contemplate, Mr. Biffin,
which I mortal had no originally possibility of answering, I may
say that what you were content to touch to as my whiskers--a colloquialism
I do not myself employ--are entirely impermeable to and unstilted
by any climatic variations whatsoever.

It cannot be overstated that the beginning of any stage play (or piece of poetry or prose)
should be simple, so that the plot can become more complex and exciting
later on.

This play has managed to follow that rule, to its advantage over other plays, in that it joins
complexity and simplicity together.

The beginning of the scene, before the ghost comes in, grabs the audience's attention and sets
an appropriate mood. They are ready to be frightened and receive a message from beyond the
grave. The author has managed in this way to lead the audience into suspension of their disbelief
in ghosts. This lays the foundation for the rest of the play, because
if the audience does not believe in the ghost, they will not believe
the story.

Page 227.

Marcell. Horatio says that we are imagining things. He won't believe the horrible thing we have
seen twice. Because of this, I have asked him to join us on the night watch. That way, if the
ghost comes again, he will believe us.

Horatio. Hush, It will not come.

This dialog tries to trick us, because it shows a main character acting as skeptical about ghostly
apparitions as we would, but then proves the existence of the ghost to the character. It is human
nature that supernatural events are much more likely to be believed
if a main character at first is skeptical and then comes to believe
in them.

Introducing it this way is much better than having all of the characters take it at face value
and believe in something supernatural so quickly. This seems to be because we have the ability
to suspend our disbelief on special occasions, if the supernatural
event is something new and rare to the characters.

However, we can't suspend our disbelief to allow for the character to find something we know
is new and rare and act as if it is commonplace.
Page 227.

Enter the Ghost.

The ghost's entrance couldn't have been
more well-times. He comes in and confirms Marcellos's story, so that
he doesn't have to repeat it (which the audience would find boring,
because they are about to go explain it to Prince Hamlet). 

The way
Horatio speaks to the ghost is natural, awe-filled, and brave. It
works for the scene and for his character.

By Heaven, I charge thee
speak. Page 227.

The other is Page 130.

He wants Marcellus to stop
it, which is natural to his character as well because it shows he
is disturbed, which is normal for an event like this. It seems very delightful that the estimable lady, from the drawing-rooms
of Upper-Radcliffe-on-the-Hudson and ballroom of rector's. It is a
fortune,today, the pluck and persistence of the pioneers carved a
way of peace for the pilgrims.

In my opinion, after considering the foregoing, this book presenting as a readable form from
the Arizona west is very opportune and it completed the need in fully.

 In the past, I used to play that royal game, but lately I have given
it up.

Now, it's no game at all, but a tiresome, but tempting science; just as cricket is artilery combat
now, and football is very dangerous, and boating huts the athlete's sentiment, and billiards
can only be played by a pro of bar spots, and the tranquil which itself became a somewhat fraudulent
system of secret signs, and open rules; even so the logical, honest
game of chess has come to be so full of known openings and plays and
other growths upon the good house-plant, that i for one have rejected
it, as a pursuit for which life is too short and serious (give me
a story or a joke instead) and one too in which any fool well book
hgamves may lord over the wisest of men with eas because of the checkmate.

However, in this connectionl I remember a little experience which proves that ignorance of famous
openers may be an advantage sometimes; just like a skilled fencer will be baffled by a brave boor
running in against rules, and by close encounter unconventionally
pinning him right away.

When younger, before matriculation, O was a guest of Culham, the rector, a very proud chess
player who thought he wasn't defeatable, because nobody around him
could defeat him. so he thought he'd make a quick victory of a thoughtful
but stammering boy, by tempting him early in the game to capture a
knight (his usual play it appeared) which could have ensured a defeat
later.

I declined the offer, which started to nag my opponent, but theni refused to answer divers
moves by the card, and finally checkmated him.

He flew into a rage, that I wouldn't play again, his "revenge" would possibly be too terrible.
 T is needed to repeat things that are written and said in this column
of this book.

In my opinion parks exist so that people can bring this country into the city and give alot back
to people who live in the city limits. City people will enjoy the fresh air which can only be
found in nature and beauty of natural objects that are arranged by the almighty God himself.
 In fact, during the four days immediately preceding
the disaster, a strong wind blew, and a sea so heavy followed the Ramillies, which was always
necessary to keep the wind in her room, rarely more than the spirit
of sailing up on the bow mast, sail and sometimes not at all, which
stated that she would go at a rate of six miles per hour.

Whenever the main-top-gallant-sail was set in the stump of the mizzen commonly complain too much,
so that it can generate the bow very difficult, and yet taken place,
provided it could be, in order to maintain the rate of merchant ships,
the slowest of which was almost as fast under his stick.

Even in the management of Ramillies thus rolled prodigiously, and as she grew clearer every
day that his movement became more uncomfortable, so that men could hardly bear to work, or
keep your legs without something to grasps. There was no such thing as real to them rest, when
sitting or lying on the deck, nor the strength enough to eat or drink
to be sure, no meat could be dressed, or any man or officer to go
to bed.

Until the afternoon of day 20 was not daring to carry it, even for a boat to board, but, despite
this desperate situation, when some fell per hour through the fatigue and lack of sleep, and
covers were covered with water, the entire crew behaved with extreme obedience, care and sobriety,
and sent no effort to preserve the ship.
After their separation in progress, the officers, which were distributed with the crew between
the Jamaica-men, had orders, respectively, to deliver them to the first man of war or the offer
must comply with, and give known to the Secretary of the Admiralty,
for as soon as possible its procedures.

A pendant was hoisted on board the Belle, by way of distinction, which could, if possible, ahead
of the rest. Some of the exchanges with her, and others made the best of his way, he feared that
soon should be less than those provisions, as there were many to
feed.

The transport of silver eel, which had sailed from Bluefields to the sick of the fleet of Sir George
Rodney, and was under the command of a lieutenant in the navy, had
been ordered to keep near Ramillies.

That ship was due in part on September 21, the day of its destruction, and as a result of several
deaths in the passage was not enough space for the receipt of all
who were sick or maimed now, and was accused by both, with them being
adequately prepared for their accommodation.

The silver eel Admiral separated in latitude 42 48 N / longitude 45
19 W. after seeing the Ramillies demolished, and ordered to make for
the port first met Falmouth on 06 October in the afternoon of the
day, a commercial vessel, with a midshipman and sixteen crew the Ramillies,
reached Plymouth.

Another of the same convoy, having on board another part of the crew, the captain and first
lieutenant, anchored in the same place before dawn the next morning. Canada, however, after having
served their maximum speed, a priori, all these, 4 of the same month
arrived at Portsmouth, where it spread the news of the spread of this
miserable fleet, which is transmitted to France, his corsairs immediately
into the sea in the hope of those prizes.

Some of the Jamaica-men, with part of the crew of the Ramillies, fell into their hands, two
of the West East Indiamen were captured in the view of the Belle, but she herself to the admiral
and thirty-three of its crew, arrived safely, albeit separately, in the October 10 at the
port of Cork, where he was the frigate Myrmidon.
 She had decided that rather than remaining
here, she would go, work and find places in the Northern States. Mainly because jobs were
uncertain in nature and the number of employees were so high that she cannot dream of a good salary
package.

"I don't care for any tea," she replied at last. A small boat containing Five negroes and a whiteman
were overhauling,When the United States government tug Potomac,on her journey to Fort de France
with the supplies from San Juan to Porto Rico. The Commander of the Potomac, Lieutenant McCormick
had ordered the persons to come on board. They were searched with suspicious view and found
of guilty of having coin and jewelery. The coin and jewelery in possession were stripped from
the fingers of the dead.

The Lieutenant McCormick placed them all under arrest and were handed over to the commander of
French cruiser Suchet for Punishment.
The grewsome horror was lacking and has no shocking details to make
the tale destruction of St.Pierre complete. Again the same Colonel Whittlesey has published a sketch of the history
of Cleveland in a volume of essays.

These essays were very brief in its nature.

Additionally the essays have given some more details about the history between 1812 and 1840.
The above efforts were totally comprised with the sum total of works and they were al considered
and devoted to Cleveland.

Cleveland was considered as very grand and simple writer in the east. Besides, the Ohio historical
Collections were also deemed as a series of sketches about countries, cities and towns of
the state.

Actually they were created by Henry Howe, and they are a little collection of stock of information.
 Reward literary work and estimate
the literary men are held, so that power increases with the Association
arising from the diversification of jobs, the introduction of consumers
and producers to close and thus stimulating circulation societary
activity.

Both decline as producers and consumers become more widely separated and that the movement becomes
more languid, as if all countries now subject to the influence of
British Free Trade.

U.S. authors to join then ask Congress to establish a fixed policy of equilibrium which will
result in giving us that industrial independence, without which there can be no political
independence, nor literary. That once secured, will find, then, no need to require establishment
of a tax system that would prove so difficult for our people that,
ultimately, to be disastrous for them.

Philadelphia, December 1867.
LETTERS
ON

Copyright.
LETTER I.

Sir: - You require information calculated to enable you to act in good agreement with reference
to international copyright treaty now awaiting Senate action.

The subject is an important one, especially as I believe, than normally
would be, and be very glad to see that now occupies your attention,
this will allow me much pleasure to comply, the extent of my power,
with your request.

Regardless of principle involved, it seems that now being proposed to be pursued is likely to
very serious objection. It is an attempt to substitute for executive action in Parliament, and
in case the latter is fully competent to do the work. For nearly twenty years, Congress was
besieged with applications on the subject, but without effect. Senate committees reported in favor
of the measure, but the lower house, composed of direct representatives of the people, remained
motionless.
 Folklore has it that she drowned, perhaps when she plummeted from the rocks or when she was
caught in the incoming tide and pulled out to sea.
Southey was moved by the Valley of Rocks.

It seemed so untamed, so large and sad, full of 'peaks and jutting edges.' He said, "Picture
a slender valley traveling between two mountainous areas, the southern one grassy, and the valley
itself, going from east to west, full of large and small rocks decorating the otherwise fern-covered
land. The northern face boasts not a single blade of grass or even a bit of dirt, but rather is
a rocky cliff, a large, impressive, almost overwhelming presence. Like the abode of preAdamite
kings, this rocky hill seemed to have no specific shape, but was also reminiscent of what was
left after the floodwaters had receded.

I climbed with difficulty to the top, which was formed by two big rocks leaning against each other
and creating a sort of gate to the peak.

When I sat, I could see a small flat place, approximately six feet in length, in front of me,
and then I noticed the ocean which was incredibly far down from where I reposed. I had never before
felt so much at peace.' The rocks are so well known that people have
christened them: two examples are the Castle Rock which overlooks
the ocean and the Devil's Cheesewring, which can be found inside the
vale.

One can walk a path, not a large one, which has been carved into the rocks which lead down
from the top to the vale, 'where rocks and other bits of stone, all
reds and grays, and coated with mosses and ivy, create dabs of color
on the side of the mountain;' and when you trudge on for close to
a mile you find yourself in Lynton.

Lynton sits proudly on crags almost a thousand feet directly above Lynmouth, and it overlooks
the inlet, which is formed by two ravines which come in from the south. The two ravines carry the
East and West Lyns, which peek out from the thick trees surrounding
them, and these two creeks meet up just prior to approaching the ocean
shore.

Countisbury Foreland can be found on the east of the pier and reaches deeply into the water, and
running between the foreland and the mainland you can find yet another
deep, curving slit in the land.

One time I was privileged to behold the bay in the enchanting light of dawn. Land, sky and water were
coated in the palest, gentlest shade of gray, and, just visible above
the horizon, I could make out the merest hint of a soft, blush of
pink.

 Mrs. Small's husband died(He was better)Mrs.
Small was in distress.

Till he was beyond suffering, pity was transferred from the principal sufferer to her. When every
body came to visit the condition of the corpse was calm and of eternal
peace.

Mrs. Small in the first letter of her widowhood, did not make a judicious application of the
favourite epithet, addressed to an intimate female friend.

It was her habit to write To this friend once a quarter . In her succession of the state of
sorrow, three following passages from her epithet inserted:- 
Addressed
to Nelly she wrote,-- A good economical undertaker was entrusted by
my brother-in-law of the funeral named Peebles.

I have not seen him,I am not for that,he was too large a way to attend himself, sends his man
for orders, all done handsome and cheap.
Funeral will be to-morrow, MARY SMALL wrote to Nelly, poor Mr. Peebles's
man came here last night.

As might be expected I was in trouble. My poor new black bonnet has not come home, I was uneasy.
Poor Peebles's man said, don't be disappointed, he were to go for
it himself in it.

Poor Peebles's man! he is up early and down late, to see all right. Came to my room this morning
before I was out of bed, was decent, &c. &c. &c. Yours to command.

MARY SMALL wrote to Nelly she wrote,--It is now three months since
that poor coffin was buried, I feel quite a strange situation and
lonely.

But business quite well and brisk. Poor kind Peebles's man! almost always about the house,
doing some kind job or other is a very decent body. I don't know how to say comfortable. There's
a sad noise with my sister's family. You know I never could bear
children.

My husband has gone, was the only one of the family that could. I know what I could do without
poor dear Peebles's man.

Yours to command.
MARY MERRIMATE wrote to Nelly,that poor dear kind Peebles's man has
never left here.

He's my right hand, assure of his decent body. Funeral took place before six good months. Now
I find I am not fit to live alone and was married this morning to poor Peebles's man. Your sincere
friend. "P.S. Excuse my change of name."
THE GATHERER.

Lord Trentham and Sir George Vandeput were candidates in electioneering in 1749, during the great
contested election for Westminster. Dr. Barrowby greatly interested himself in favour of the
latter, was put up to oppose the Court party .

The doctor had for some weeks attended the noted Joe Weatherby, landlord of the Ben Jonson's
Head, in Russell-street, who had become extremely thin by a nervous
fever.

During Dr. Barrowby's visits, the patient's wife, not knowing the doctor's political attachment,
expressed her uneasiness frequently that Joey could not get up, and
vote for her good friend Lord Trentham.

 The initial
spray, just prior to blossoming, with lead arsenate is for curculio, also named as Palmer worm,
for canker wormâif they are presentâthe roller of leaves and
tent caterpillars and many different bugs that harm vegetation and
its produce.

 

"I'm in dental college."
"Can I ask you your age?"
"I'm twenty'six."
"Are you married?"
"No, single."
"Where were you raised?"
"Maine."

"What did this man do?"
"He's accused of murder." replied Bulmer.
"Oh really?" Corbin questioned. Looking at the prisoner dead in the eyes.
"That's what I'm told." replied Jackson.
Illustration: As she cried "My Pear, my sweet Pearl," Mrs. Bryan identified the victims clothing.

Two carriage tickets were found in Jackson's pockets, for the Central Newport Bridge. He obviously
frequented this bridge, and it could be of great help to this case.

Detective Bulmer and Officer Jake search Jackson. Then lead him to his cell.

Right when Jackson arrived, it was suggested to Lieutenant Corbin that he be taken and immediately
searched. This tip may have ensured his conviction.
The prisoner had been scratched twice. A small scratch on the wrist and another that goes the
length of his forearm.
Blood was also noticed on the man's shirt. It looked as though he had tried to remove the sleeves
as to get rid of any evidence against him.
"Can you tell me where that blood on your shirt came from?" asked Lieutenant Corbin.
The prisoner,"The bugs wouldn't quit pestering me and I scratched myself up pretty bad."
"I have a lot of scratches on me as you can see. I've had some sort
of aliments on my breast here, you see, the blood doesn't prove anything."
It didn't seem as the man tried to hide the papers that were confiscated
from him during his incarceration. 
WALLING ARRESTED 
Jackson's
roommate,Alonzo Walling, apparently knew more than he had led on.
He was arrested at 3:30 Thursday morning. When Jackson was arrested
it was assumed Walling knew nothing of the incident, but evidence
has proven different. 
The two men had been intimate with the same
woman from Louisville. They were also known to have been very intimate
with each other as well. 
Jackson's remark at two o'clock in the
morning is what set sights on Walling. Right after he had been locked
up Jackson called Turnkey Curren and said: 
Could you please sit
in front of my cell for me? I'd feel much safer if you did." 
"Think
you'll be hung?" replied the turnkey. 

Suwarrow was a man instantly noticed by everyone because he had such a dignified bearing. One
was impressed by his intelligence and inexhaustible energy. He was also very capable. It was
no wonder then, that he achieved the rank of lieutenant-colonel before he reached the age of
thirty. He was so confident of his own superior abilities that he could never consider himself
under the authority of someone else. When Suwarrow reminisced about his career in the army, he
would talk about his complete dependence on his own abilities which made him disregard orders
from even the Queen. His contention was that being in the field, and having vast experience in
warfare, he was bound to go by what he considered the best action to be taken at any given
moment. If the Queenâs orders were contrary to his own assessment of the situation, he would
disregard them on the premise that not being on the scene the queen will not be aware of the
real situation, and her orders must have been made according to the dictates of her councilors
who did not appreciate him. He was certain that whatever he did was in the interests of the Queen
and for her glory.

His penchant to follow his own intellect and instinct, even to the extent of disregarding the Queenâs
orders was often justified. One such instance took place in 1771. Suwarrow was a Major-General
now.

He received intelligence that the Grand Marshall of Lithuania was gathering a large number of
Polish people at Halowitz. He lost no time informing his Commander-in-Chief, Marshal Boutourlin,
of this amassing of Poles at Halowitz, and asked permission to attack them. Major Boutourlin
was not one to be rushed into any action.

He was always a careful and cautious man. He refused to permit Suwarrow to attack because
the Poles heavily outnumbered Suwarrowâs men. At this time Suwarrow received intelligence that
the Poles, numbering five thousand men at that time, had beaten the regiment of Petersburgh. This
news fired him up for action. Suwarrow was always keen to follow the path of danger. It thrilled
him to do so. Though the Polish army was increasing in numbers all the time, Suwarrow took
matters into his own hand, and in flagrant disregard of Marshal Boutourlinâs
orders, he quickly marched to the place where the Polish army was
camped, swooped down on them in the wee hours of the night in a surprise
attack, and scattered the Polish army.

Halowitz was now his and he was the absolute victor.
Though he was victorious, and had captured Halowitz along with six cannons, the fact remained
that he had deliberately disobeyed orders not to attack. Such an action had to be punished,
according to military rules. Suwarrow was the first to acknowledge that he had disobeyed orders
and therefore merited punishment. As a token of this he sent in his sword, saying that he had
disobeyed but his timely action had prevented the Confederate forces
from uniting into a force that would have become too strong for them
to overcome.

He was convinced that he had done his duty, as a patriotic Russian, in doing what he did.

One can well imagine the dilemma in which Marshal Boutourlin now found himself in, when confronted
by Major General Suwarrowâs statement. Naturally, he put the entire matter before Empress
Catherine and left it to her to decide what action had to be taken on Suwarrow. The Empress,
while acknowledging that military rules demanded punishment to be meted out for disobedience,
she was inclined not only to overlook the act of disobedience, but to reward Suwarrow as a true
son of Russia who had acted in the interests of his country and his
sovereign.

She awarded him the Order of St. Alexander.
Suwarrow was adored by his troops because the endured all their hardships
and dangers, staying right by their side.

He would seek no special comforts or privileges that his rank entitled him to. He lived just like
the soldiers under his command, eating the food they ate, and sleeping in the bivouacs just
as they did. He marched on foot by their side and led cavalry attacks.

He never pampered himself in any way but totally identified himself
with his men.

When food was in short supply he would declare a day of fasting and
prayer, leading this ritual himself.

He was very devout, starting and ending every day with prayers.

No battle began without prayers being said first. Major General Suwarrow was like no other
commanding officer.

His men loved him dearly and revered him greatly.

 The Spaniards are known to be generous, and no one forgets or
pardons more readily or more entirely. Those who knew Madrid in the days of Isabel II., would
not have imagined it feasible that the Queen, who had been banished with so much overall joy,
could, under any situational factors, have received int he capital a heartfelt greeting; in fact,
it was for long thought inexpedient to allow her to chance a popular demonstration of quite
another character.

But when she came to see her son, after the restoration of Alfonso XII., her transgressions, which
were many, were pardoned.
It was, perchance, recalled that in her youth she had been more sinned against than committing
sin; that she was muy Espanola, benevolent and gracious in demeanor, pitiful and kind to all. Therefore,
so long as she did not remain, and did not in any way interfere in the government, the citizens
were ready to receive her with acclamation, and were likely really elated to see her againw ithout
her camarilla, and with no authority to injure the new order of things.
No country in the world is more naturally democratic than Spain--none, perchance, so attached
to royalty; but one lesson has been taught here, probably alike by King and commoners--that absolution
is far gone and done with buried in the past.
The ruler of Spain, currently and in the future, must represent the will of the people; and
if at any moment the two should once more come into poignant conflict,
it is not the united individuals of this once-divided nation that
would give way.

For the rest, so long as royalty rules constitutionally, and respects
the rights and desires of the people, there is certainly nothing to
fear from pretender or republican.

At a recent political gathering in Madrid, for the first time, were seen democrats, republicans
and monarchists one in spirit; amidst a goodly amount of somewhat "tall" talk, two remarks
stood out and received with acclamation by all parties: one was that Italy had found freedom,
and had made herself into a united nationality, under a constitutional monarch; and the other
, that between the Government of England and a republic there was no difference except in name--that
in all Europe there was no nation so democratic or so certainly free as Great Britain under her
King, nor one in which the citizens so entirely governed themselves.
Among the many error some ideas which procure currency in England with regard to Spain, perchance
none is more known or more baseless than the fiction about Don Carlos and his probability of
success.
A specific small class of writers from time to time compose absurd articles in English papers
and magazines about what they are complacent to call the "legitimatist"
cause, and proclaim its coming victory in the Peninsula. And so, Freedom and Fraternity, inspired by the great Declaration
of Independence, is the difference when comparing the United States
to Great Britain. My favorite poems are Christabel and Kubla-Khan;
The Skylark, The Cloud and The Eve of Saint Agnes and The Nightingale; certain of the Nocturnes.
They are just the essence of what poetry is supposed to be for me.
Shelley uses rich and remarkable diction for the most part in much of his work, but in these
poems, it doesn't come across as such, rather it does not obtrude
itself at all. It is not noticeable.

He is inspired by Echo, whose body has dissolved from about her voice.
 It was too good
a joke, the welcome release coming at the last moment. 

He just looked down, except once when he stole a look towards the
man whose life depended on his evidence, as he waited to be enquired.

But the spiteful stare of Birchill made him lower his gaze at once.
Hill started to speak in a very low voice and Mr. Walters asked him
to speak louder.

His evidence made a noticeable impact on the court as Sir Henry Hodson
listened to him carefully, when Hill narrated the weird events of
the night of the murder composedly.

When he had finished he glanced at the dock, to see Birchill seated, his head bowed down and
supporting his face with one hand. Mr. Walters sat down systematically folding up his brief.
As he sat he looked in the direction of Mr. Holymed, and so did every
others in the court as the great K.C. adjusted his gown and got ready
for the cross-examination of the principal Crown witness.

He did to the admiration of the spectators who were on the side on the man in the dock. Hill
was questioned on his lapse of loyalty and he reluctantly admitted that the theft was committed
to save his starving wife and child, which the Counsel had named
avarice, since the master who trusted him treated him with kindness
had been robbed.

Though Hill tried to evade and twisted the answers Holymead made him speak out this and standing
firmly shook a finger of warning at the witness saying â He had
robbed a master who had trusted him and had treated him with kindness.

Having extracted this fact, in spite of Hill's evasions and twistings, Holymead straightened
himself to his full height, and, shaking a warning finger at the witness, said: âI know
the reason why Sir Horace Fewbanks took you as his butler in his Riversbrook household and it
was that you were a man who would be ready to do things that men of principles would never
doâ "That is a lie," said Hill.  "Is it a lie that women who were immoral were frequently
entertained by your late master at Riversbrook?" roared the K.C.
Hill was shocked at the question.

His conclusion that Mr. Holymead has taken up the case to save Sir
Horaceâs name from getting spoiled was not right and his masterâs
veil of secrecy is being ruthlessly torn aside.

Hill hesitantly looked round the court and saw that his reply was
awaited.

He answered when the question was repeated to him, âWomen who
were immoral?â he staggered and replied that he did not understand.
âYou do understand me, Hill.

I mean the women who do not mind letting confidential servants see
that they do not regard the conventions of life. they were women who
were not worried about their time of return home.

You used to smuggle them out of thehouse without the knowledge of other servants. Wasnât it?
"I--I--"  "Donât dodge, answer the question, witness."  "Y-es, sir."  There was a slight
stir in the court as Miss Fewbanks and Mrs. Hoylmead were leaving
the court.

The modern women in the court eyed at the daughter of the murdered
man, for what would be her reaction to her dead fatherâs secret
life.

"And sometimes these visitors and your master had rows. Did they not? went on Holymead.  "Rows,
sir?"  " Certainly, when some people become quarrelsome under the
influence of wine."

"Yes, sir."

"Well, did your late master's visitors at night ever become quarrelsome?"  " At times,
sir."  "Did you help these ladies out?"

" On occasions, sir."  "And naturally they had told you something
about your master?"

"Sometimes they didn't what they spoke."  "Naturally," remarked Counsel dryly. "Did they
threaten?"  "Not everyone," replied Hill, who now understood the path of the enquiry.
 Now, accepting the histological plan of Gerlach, which claims the
brain has a mass of white substance that is a mesh-work of intercellular
fibrils, a close idea seemed possible due to the way the ganglionic
activities are linked and built up into the higher mental processes.

Such a idea tied well with the theories of the psychology dominant associationists.

"Miss Ruck BERT" is one of the few writers from whom I really enjoy stories about the war.
The involvement of so that it can also refer to (at least more bearable aspects of IT) support and
beauty. A Love Story Land in girls' (Hodder and Stoughton), subject to his heart when he gave

I greatly enjoyed the acquisitions of my inheritance.

First I went to London, the capital city, where, for the first time,
I experienced true vanity and all of the glory that comes with money
and wealth.

 

"Don't you love me?" As I looked into her sweet face, I knew I'd do
anything in the world for her.

"A little less groveling and a little more respect would work better, Mr. Highrank. Now, stop
this silly game and let go of my dress! And I will be really mad if you don't get up this instant!"

"I will obey if you'll just give me one kind word."
"I have no kind words for you, Mr. Highrank." 
"Did I move too fast?
Do you think I'm not really in love with you? I am, I really am, I
promise you that much." Grief is akin
to the process of dying in that it affects the body in a particular
way.

All the bodily functions, such as eating, sleep, and leisure activities, are disturbed. The
body is thrown out of balance over a period of weeks or months. The
task of a division of fifteen gun boats with the frigate "Junon" was the first work carried
out, at its full stretch , when the war ship "Junon" got in to trouble
when it was forwarded to fight with the ships, at the head of the
James River.

She was abondoned at the upper part of Hampton Roads and within three miles, there was not even a single
British ship available . The firing of cannon last for about forty five minutes and finally two
companion ships,along with a fine and gentle wind, reached there to help "Junon".
 

Although the lessons are short and varied, in a single morning or after noon there are many
changes.

Fifteen minutes was believed to be sufficient time for a lesson in
an Infant School some years ago.

This is not strictly followed. Lessons become short and numerous, and it gives an unsettled
character to the work; At a moments notice children are swung from
topic to topic with no well founded link or reason.

For example, the day may begin with the story of a boy sent by train to the country, or settled
at a farm and taken out to see the cow and the sow.

But after a while this is found to be a reading lesson on words ending in "ow," but after the whole
class is told quite suddenly after a short time, that one is to used in town at a shop. And they
still calculate change in the distributed paints. And the children are painting the blueblee. Certainly
the whole day is sure to be of this broken character. And it doesn't make for training in mental
concentration or for unity in the realization of life. I think teachers really just aim for correlation,
and in a rather half-hearted way: some actually discard it because
of its strained applications, and very definitely has taken its place.

The given curriculum is arrived in varied character, this includes a free period from time to time.
The three R's still occupy a prominent place in the Babie's Class . While Children under six
spend a relative great deal of time in these subject. children between
ten and thirteen, if they are still in school, are taught to put down
answers on paper, which they always calculate without much help.

I think children work on a fair number of sums on paper and can read well. They are considered
fit for promotional if this happens, and the question of whether the understand the method of
working such sums, is not considered so important as accuracy and quickness. You know, the
so-called intellect for advancement is really just reading and numbers.

But it is really a test of convenience, and a large number of adults even need to be taught
together.

It's just against the laws of nature to have such a uniform standard.
I think the real problem with promotion and uniformity test driven results is worked down even through
the Infant School. It can be seen when the babies are changed frmo activities they naturally
would have done to learn reading, or when they are "examined": it
can be seen when a teacher yields up her bright children to fill a
few empty desks, it can be seen in the grind of reading and formal
arithmetic of the children under six, and when these uesless people
are spent in working against nature, and precious time is wasted that
never ever comes back.

I think we say to them, "children have their young time and may play", and taht "play is the best
activity at this stage."

In regards to childhood.

The fluid nature is really the lack of any clear aim and the term
"results".

To some people I think it means readiness for promotion, or just
some work to present for satisfactory external appearance, such as
math, neatness, a game, or just fluency.

I think other think of something deeper, which have them discover some remakr of a child that
masks the progress of the spirit, or the awakening of the interest of a child whose development
is late. or the quickened power of a child to express; or the evidenc
eof the interest of a child whose development is late, or the quickened
power of a child to express; of the independance of their thought
and the power they have in that piece of work or appreciateion of
the music and literature they're given to read.

I think the meaning we use for results is so the method of the teacher
must change but the transitional state; some kind of person is always
a common of her ground and a little afraid that he is not quite up
to the latest data while the worst teachers is sometimes a little
scared, and not quite sure that they are ready to account for the
rather subtle outcome of his or her work.

 

The horses in the stables were made either out or dead, and nothing would have been easier to
have set fire to the houses, thereby ensuring the destruction of all the Christines. From this
measure bloody, one or Valmaseda Cabrera probably would not have hesitated to adopt ZumalacÃ¡rregui
abstained.

"I did not agree," says his biographer, "with the principles of fairness and justice that he
observed in relation to the villages and their inhabitants, from which we can only infer that
the burning alive of five hundred soldiers Christines could have been carried out without damaging homes or
farmers, would have been either an acceptable sacrifice for the Carlist
chief.

When calculated on the full benefits of this expedition had been obtained, the retreat was sounded,
and, forming his men as quickly, ZumalacÃ¡rregui marched quickly away, carrying weapons, horses
and prisoners which had been taken. With all his haste, however, starting early the next day and
Oraa Lorenzo is at his heels, but the cautious Carlist had omitted
no precaution, and in anticipation of a prosecution, had ordered four
battalions to meet him in neighboring switch Lizarraga, consequently,
where he found awaiting their arrival, and immediately prepared to
give a warm reception Christines.

The latter, on arriving in front of the position, probably as being too formidable to attack
one, it immediately withdrew, leaving ZumalacÃ¡rregui in the peaceful enjoyment of a victory
that greatly increased his reputation and trust of his followers.
Quesada, who succeeded Valdes in command of the army of the queen, was the first to introduce
the horrible system of retaliation, or rather should say, sometimes, for cruelty to prisoners.
ValdÃ©s, had done little to stop the war, had at least not poisoned or rendered more ferocious
character of what he had found. Despite the fact that it was impossible to suspect him of any
inclination towards his opponents, he always showed great moderation and humanity, and made
the Carlist wounded who fell into their hands to be treated as carefully
as if they were their own men.

Quesada, in the angry hand, with the failure of some attempts were
made to seduce ZumalacÃ¡rregui and Carlist leaders then others, their
obedience to Him they called their king, and acting under the influence
of a provision many events of his life proved sufficiently cruel and
bloodthirsty, just had assumed command when the signal was given of
retaliation, shooting the officer Carlist Pamplona, Don Juan Hugalde,
although ZumalacÃ¡rregui had offered to give an officer and two Christino
sergeants to change it.

 

It clears wrongs and can not be lied to, fixes things that are not pure and can not be made bad. She
listens but does not repeat, sees no evil and loves everyone.

It is begotten grace, made by virtue, raised by learning and kept
that way by love. The cosmetic
condition of the penis as an organ of copulation is a question of some importance, and should not
be overlooked because, despite the size, shape or function of the
penis is not prominent in the complaints of women to seek divorce
- all other loads in the sun - you can assume that this body and his
condition, the original, silent and invisible, as are the power behind
the throne in the unconscious background of all business in more than
one case.

 Of these speculations, some have turned out to be very successful,
but now the market cannot be relied upon as the Government understands
and has made provisions for the wants of the station.

There is a chance to the officers selling mess-stones, although this
is not a certainty.

Merchantment charge prices that correspond to the scarcity of the article and can be enormous.
I have seen nine dollars a barrel charged for Irish, or rater Yankee,
potatoes and have paid my share for a small amount at that rate.

It may seem strange to those that see this vegetable regularly on their tables that the price might
be five times higher than that of an orange, but after eating yams
and cassada for months together you too would learn to appreciate
a mealy potato.

Even the most delicious of tropical fruits cannot compensate for the absence of it. If Eve had
known how to boil potatoes, then Adam's fare in Paradise might have been much improved and the
fatal apple might not even have been so tempting.
March 30 -- Got under way, at daylight, and stood down the coast.
Nothing else at Settra Kroo that I recollect requires description, apart from the person and garb
of a native lady of fashion. A young woman came up yesterday, while I was sitting with my friend
Jack Purser. She had a pipe in her mouth and a cloth around her loins
that was dyed in bright colours was all she wore.

This left her as fully exposed as any classic sculptor could have wished for. The sable hue, however
is in itself a kind of veil and takes away from the sense of nudity which would so oppress
the eyes if a woman of my own race where to be so scantily attired. The tall, finely shaped
native lady would have been not a little attractive if it was not for the white clay which she
had smeared over her face and busom. Many rows of blue beads were wrapped around her ankles
and encircled her leg below the knee as a kind of garter, although no stockings were worn. She
had a pleasant smile and agreeable disposition and certainly if the rest of Jack Purser's
wives (for this was just one of the twentynine) were so well-fitted
to his happiness, then the total of his conugal felicity must be great!

31 -- Sunday.

It was oppressively hot today. Three more cases of fever presented today, making a total of
fourteen along with the sixteen or seventeen of other ailments. The crew are afraid that we
have general sickness on board.
April 1 -- Off Cape Palmas.

A canoe was sent to the shore and returned with a letter from the Rev. Mr Hazlehurst, asking
for two missionaries to have passage to the Gaboon. The captain's sympathies could not resist
the request, so we ran in and anchored.
2 -- Went ashore in the gig, and read the newspapers at the Governor's to amuse myself while
the captain rode out to Mount Vaughan where the mission was established. While I was there, a
missionary who was native from Kentucky, rode in to the Government House from Mount Vaughan in
country style. His wagon was drawn by eight natives and he was sat
bolt upright with an umbrella over his head.

I have heard the maligners say, but have never before seen such an example of the priesthood
wishing to ride on the necks of their people. Metaphorically, indeed I should be far from casting
such doubt on the zealous and single-minded missionary before me.

He was an eminent figure, at least six foot three tall, with a massive nose that was long and deep,
but very thin across the edge. It was strange to meet in Africa a person so strongly showing the
peculiarities of his native land, but his manner had the real Western
swing and his dialect was more marked than usual among educated men.

This is a matter of no moment with a native audience.

We learnt that the Roman Catholics are about to leave Cape Palmas, and establish mission branches
at the different French stations on the coast, all under the patronage of Louis Philippe. The Presbyterians
have all departed for the Gaboon river and the Episcopal Mission
pines at Cape Palmas and may soon be removed.

The disagreements between the Colonial Government and its members continues with unabated bitternes.
Mr. Hazlehurst regrets that the colonists identified with the missionaries
with the twentyfour kings and headmen at Cape Palmas.

He believes that the missionaries on the out stations would be the first victims in case of
any outbreak of the natives

 The loud blast filled the air and was heard
by many. Miss Marigold cried, "I declare, it's that filthy fellow Punch coming afore our vindow

"You've no taste for fun, Biddy." While speaking to Miss Marigold, the alderman placed a hand
on me and my daughter's shoulder.

 At first glance, it might have appeared that the seats were set up
like they were to be convenient.

As it turns out, we set up 18 benches for 100 wives and widows as well as their daughters and servants.
The men were forced to stand or kneel in the aisles, as instructed by the priest. There is still

TREATMENT THAT CONTROLS STAMMERING

Inquiry by A.M.D: Kindly indicate helpful tips in The Healthy Life Magazine which will show
how to handle a minor case of stammering in a teenager whose speech
impediment has been assumed as impossible to cure.

The person(s) willing to remedy this condition must be adept at curing stammerers and should
get in touch with Miss Behncke residing in 18 Earl's Court Square, S.W.,and who makes a speciality
of treating stammering cases.

WHY RED CORPUSCLES ARE WANTING IN ANAEMIA
A.M.D writes:-Apart from dieting , how do I increase red corpuscles in my blood? Walking nine
miles or more in day doesn't help. Is this method reliable ? The skin is supposed to improve
with the witish apperance diminishing.

Red corpuscles deficiency which is indicated in anaemia is often due to self -poisoning. Food
purification in the digestive system ( the colon to be exact) causes toxins to be created.
When absorbed into the blood this toxins destroy the red blood corpuscles.

Walking , while advisable is not sufficient to rememdy this malady. The unhealthy condition
of the colon can be rectified when diets and general habits of the
sufferer changes.

caused by you.

What is true of you two with all the other electrons.

I separated a little reels of this sketch, so you can think of a
cover of.

I do not know how an electron can affect another on the opposite side of that coverage, but
if you can.

And I really do not know anything about the coverage, which is usually
called "ether."

Coverage is not the air. That would be the same if the coils in a
vacuum.

Ether "is simply a name for what remains in the space around us when we took everything we can see
or feel - each molecule, each proton and one electron each.
Why and how electrons can interact when they are far apart, is one of the great mysteries of
science. We know nothing more of it than why are electrons.

Let's accept it as a fundamental fact that we still can not explain.

And now we see how to make a Audion produce an alternating current,
or as we sometimes say "do Audion oscillator.

Create an Audion with its battery of A as in Fig. Between 34th filament
network and put a coil and a capacitor.

Note that they are in parallel, as they say. In the plate circuit of filaments that connect the
battery and switch B, S, and a second coil.

This coil in the plate circuit of the Audion, a place close to the other coil so that the two
coils are ab and cd as broadband as I have said.

The fact that all power flows in the coil former, there will be a
continuous flow in the CD of the coil.

(A-induced electron flow.) Of course, if the B-battery switch is open current can not flow.

In the circuit immediately closes S-B of the battery makes the plate
positive with respect to the filament and there is a sudden wave of
electrons around the circuit board and through the coil from A to
B. Do you know what it means to CD queue.

It induces a flow of electrons from the day c. Where do the electrons? Why the network and
the plate of a capacitor. Where do they go?

Gelli Wic at Cornwall took the promise and gave it back to Arthur. Let me tell you here: when a man silent night, meditating on the

putting aside personal observations, for the sake of expressing his
thoughts, he matures from sources I pointed out, not allowed to use
his pen, with the exception of inspiration Bossuet and Massillon,
allow me to ask if there is one word to express my surprise, my pain,
saw the man dragged into court - on account of some passages from
his book, and that is true and most elevated ideas that he was able
to bring together!

And please remember me in this regard contempt charge against religious

And then, if you will allow me, I will put in opposition, however, under your very eyes, what
I call myself the moral challenge, ie, satisfaction of the senses,

To get away this unfamiliar and rather overpowering air of friendliness our part of the Salonica
Force directly made for the closest accessible foe and discovered us at a lonesome location on
the Turkish frontier.

The title of the O.C. Local Bulgars started with Boris, and he was
a Candidat Offizier or Cadet, and portraying Town Major.

As an earnest of good-will, he displayed us photographs of his dwelling, before and after the most
latest pogrom, and of his grandfather, a bandit with a flourishing perform in the Philippopolis
locality, much highly regarded locally.
We took up our dispositions, and soon all agents were committed arranging out the doubtful individual
characteristics apprehended by the sentries. It was in this way that I became acquainted with
Serge Gotastitch the Serb.
When he was conveyed before me I dispatched for Aristides Papazaphiropoulos,
our interpreter, and in the meantime consigned a short address to
the Sergeant-Major, Quartermaster-Sergeant and Storeman on the inferiority
of the Balkan peoples, with specific quotation to the specimen before
us, to who, in outlook of the detail that he appeared a little underneath
himself, I provided a tot of rum.

He eyed it with suspicion.
"What's this?" he inquired abruptly (in English). "Whisky?"
I acquainted him that it was rum.
"That's the goods," he said, and drank it. I then commenced interrogation.
"You are a Bulgar?" I asked.
"No," said Serge cheerlessly, "I am Serb."

"Serb! Then what are you managing here?"

"I hail from Prilep," he explained. "When Bulgar arrive Prilep, they state, 'You not Serb; you
Bulgar.' So they bringit me here with other ones, and I workit on railroad. My family I not understand
where they are; no apparel getting, no cash neither. English abounding money," he supplemented,
Ã  propos of nothing.
I disregarded the hint.
"Then you are a detainee of war?" I suggested.

"In vintage time," he proceeded, "Turks have Prilep. I proceed to America and workit on trains
Chicago--three, four year. When I arrive back Turks take me for army. Not admiration I wasteland
to Serbish army.

When conflict complete, Serbs have Prilep. I proceed dwelling Serbish
civil.

Then this conflict start.

Bulgar arrive to Prilep and state, 'You Bulgar, you arrive work for us.' You understahn me,
boss?"
"I should gaze into this," I said to the Sergeant-Major.

"Send for the interpreter and inquire the Bulgar agent to step in. He's just going past." 
Boris
reached with a salute and a charming grin and heard to my tale.

Then he turned a freezing eye on Serge and blew into a torrent of Bulgarian, under which Serge stood
with raising scalp.
"Sir," faltered Serge, when the cascade stopped, "I am liar.

All I said to you is false.

I am good Bulgar. I despise Serbs."

"Then you are not, in detail, a Serb?" I said. 
"Nope," said Serge,
nodding his head frantically (the Oriental procedure of negation).
"Do you desire to proceed home?" I inquired cunningly. 
"Sure,
boss," answered he. "Want to proceed Chicago." 
Boris uttered one
exploding guttural and Serge receded to the horizon with large rapidity.
 "The little that occured can be told in a short span of time."
says W. S. Merriwether, the New York Herald correspondent.

"It is understood that one moment was a brightly smiling city and another a hellish display
of swirling flames. 30,000 people are believed to have perished. One minute the church bells were
playing jubilantly in St. Pierre's and the next a sobbing lament
from its unfortunate inhabitants."

carried a suitcase which she placed on the floor.

That suitcase had an air of certitude around it, and its lock leered
at me with chagrin.

I jumped from my chair to my wife with unusual energy. I must hide that awful phantom from her,
at all costs!

She did not glance at me, or past me - thank heaven, but she fixated her injured stare upon the
garbage can, as if to extort dark secrets from it.

"I have come
to tell you that I am leaving," she informed me.

"Oh, yes, yes!"
I acknowledged, waving my arms about to attract attention from the
corner. "That's fine - great!"

"So you want me to go, do you?" she
questioned.

"Sure, yes - right away! A change of pace will do you
good.

Mr. Edward Anthony of 205 Broadway, New York city, has manufactured,

Among some tribes women are permitted a great deal of freedom over their relationships. According
to Heriot, tribe members describe this practice by saying "a young woman is mistress of her own
person, and a free agent." Perhaps surprisingly, however, the tie of marriage is strictly observed.
This is true in spite of the fact that divorce is quite easy to obtain,

Zhing, which is converted rightly sufficient "essence," is the more subtle and untainted part of
matter-- the grosser pattern of the elementary ether; Khi, or "spirit," is the wind, still material
but purer than the zhing, and is made of the finer and more hardworking pattern of ether. In
the hwun, or soul (animus) the Khi predominates and the zhing (or zing) in the pho or animal
soul.

At death the hwun (Or religious soul) rambles away, ascending, and the pho (the origin of the
Tibetan phrase Pho-hat) descends and is altered into a ghostly shadow
(the shell).

Dr. Medhurst conceives that "the Kwei Shans" (see "Theology of the Chinese," pp. 10-12) are
"the increasing and contracting values of human life!" "The Kwei Shans" are conveyed about by
the dissolution of the human frame--and comprise of the increasing and ascending Shan which
rambles about in space, and of the bound and shrivelled Kwei, which reverts to soil and nonentity.
Therefore, the Kwei is the personal body; the Shan is the crucial standard the Kwei Shan the
linga-sariram, or the crucial soul; Zhing the fourth standard or
Kama Rupa, the essence of will; pho, the animal soul; Khi, the religious
soul; and Hwun the untainted spirit--the seven values of our occult
doctrine!--Ed.

Theos. --------- Brahmanism on the Sevenfold Principle in Man
It is now very tough to state what was the genuine very vintage Aryan
doctrine.

If an inquirer were to try to response it by an investigation and
evaluation of all the diverse schemes of esotericism current in India,
he will shortly be lost in a maze of obscurity and uncertainty.

No evaluation between our genuine Brahmanical and the Tibetan esoteric doctrines will be likely
except one ascertains the teachings of that so-called "Aryan doctrine," and completely comprehends
the entire variety of the very vintage Aryan philosophy.

Kapila's "Sankhya," Patanjali's "Yog philosophy," the distinct schemes
of "Saktaya" beliefs, the diverse Agamas and Tantras are but parts
of it.

There is a doctrine, though, which is their genuine base, and which is adequate to interpret
the mysteries of these diverse schemes of beliefs and harmonize their
teachings.

It likely lived long before the Vedas were amassed, and it was revised by our very vintage Rishis
in attachment with the Hindu scriptures.

It is attributed to one secret personage called Maha.*.....
---------- * The very name of the present head of the esoteric Himalayan
Brotherhood.--Ed.

Theos.

----------

The Upanishads and such portions of the Vedas as are not chiefly dedicated to the public ceremonials
of the very vintage Aryans are barely intelligible without some information of that doctrine.
Even the genuine implication of the impressive ceremonials mentioned
to in the Vedas will not be flawlessly apprehended without its lightweight
being hurl upon them.

The Vedas were possibly amassed mostly for the use of the clerics aiding at public observance,
but the grandest deductions of our genuine mystery doctrine are therein mentioned. I am acquainted
by individuals competent to referee of the issue, that the Vedas
have a distinct dual meaning--one conveyed by the literal sense of
the phrases, the other demonstrated by the metre and the swara (intonation),
which are, as it were the life of the Vedas.

Learned Pundits and philologists of course refute that swara has
any thing to manage with beliefs or very vintage esoteric doctrines;
but the secret attachment between swara and lightweight is one of
its most deep secrets.

Now, it is exceedingly tough to display if the Tibetans drawn from
their doctrine from the very vintage Rishis of India, or the very
vintage Brahrnans wise their occult research from the adepts of Tibet;
or, afresh, if the adepts of both nations professed initially the
identical doctrine and drawn from it from a widespread source.* If
you were to proceed to the Sramana Balagula, and inquiry some of the
Jain Pundits there about the authorship of the Vedas and the source
of the Brahmanical esoteric doctrine, they would likely notify you
that the Vedas were created by Rakshasas** or Daityas, and that the
Brahmans had drawn from their mystery information from them.*** 
---------
* See Appendix, Note I. 
** A kind of demons-devil.

*** And so would the Christian padris. But they would not ever accept that their "fallen angels"
were scrounged from the Rakshasas; that their "devil" is the illegitimate child of Dewel, the Sinhalese
feminine demon; or that the "war in heaven" of the Apocalypse--the
base of the Christian dogma of the "Fallen Angels" was made a replicate
from the Hindu article about Siva hurling the Tarakasura who rebelled
contrary to the gods into Andhahkara, the abode of Darkness, as asserted
by Brahmanical Shastras.

---------
Do these claims signify that the Vedas and the Brahmanical esoteric teachings had their source
in the lost Atlantis--the countries that one time used by a substantial
piece of the expanse of the Southern and the Pacific oceans?

 

Back to Venice!

A particularly early fourteenth, possibly, thirteenth century superb tomb is an impeccable example
of Gothic architecture. This tomb is located Westward the Church of Frari, second chapel to
the left. This unmarked crypt reflects the belonging of a mysterious
knight.

An arched awning upholds the knight's crest while a deep blue and starry scene fills the underlying
space.The sarcophagus is mounted with gallant brackets upon the chapel wall. From a distance
the stuate is crudely carved, yet gentley from gifted work. Laid in his mail, only the knights
hands and face are visible.

Made of chain-mail are the hauberk and helemt. The limbs are armoured with jointed steel. Marked
by two sewn arrows, the tunic lies close to the breast embellishing dignity. A dagger at his
right; his extensive sword at his left, hidden from observers.

Peering towards the master from underneath his feet is a hound, as his crest. Generally, faces
of tombs of this stature should be slighty presented towards the
viewer.

However, this statue's face is opposite the spectator and instead gazing upward at a small carved
image of St. Joseph holding the infant Christ who is staring back
down at the knight.

 Oh for the many wonders England does breeds; the last remains - A lady, in
the face of of Nature, unblemished, on whom all love, yet in whom no love is placed, Where Fairness
yields to Wisdom's shortest reins.

A humble pride, a scorn that favor stains; In the mould of a woman, shines with an angelâs
grace; with the mind of an angel, but in a woman cased; A heaven on earth, or an earth that
heaven contains: Now this wonder to myself I frame; She is the cause
that all the rest I am.

* * *

The blind man's mark; the fool's self-chosen snare, Fond fancy's scum,
and dregs of strewn thought: Band of all evils; cradled causeless
care; the web of will, whose end is never wrought: 

Desire!

Desire! I have too dearly bought, with the price of a mangled mind, I purchased the worthless ware;
Too long, too long, sleep you have brought me; to whom should my mind higher things prepare;

But yet in vain you have my ruin sought; In vain you made me to vain
things aspire; In vain you kindled all you smoke and fire: For Virtue
has this better lesson taught, Within myself to seek my only hire,
Desiring how to kill Desire.

POEM: FROM EARTH TO HEAVEN

Leave me, O love!

Which reaches but to dust; Allow my mind to aspire to higher things: Grow rich in that which
never takee rust; whatever fades, but fading pleasure brings.

Draw in your beams, and humble all your might to that sweet yoke where
lasting freedoms be, which breaks the clouds, and opens forth the
light, that does both shine, and give us sight to see.

Oh take fast hold! Let that light be you guide, In this small course which birth draws out to
death, and think how evil over comes him to slide, those who seeks heaven, and comes from heavenly
breath. Then say farewell, world, your extreme I see, Eternal Love, maintain your life in me.

of men through his characters. "For my health," he
contributed, "I hope to preseve it long unless heaven has decided
otherwise."

He took leave after uttering these words.

assumption that those words would be the last my father spoke to me. I was relieved after receiving

the one who introduced best between wisdom extract by the sense of humour, and that obtained through

 To make sweat and bring action about, a warm bath was sometimes ordered, it was helpful
sometimes. However, since it wasn't convenient, pediluvia (hot bricks on which water and vinegar
are poured) served fine substitutes. If there were occasions in which there was too much arterial
action, these methods were not used until the heartbeat was slowed
by the lancet and other procedures.

Now, speaking of emetics, I don't have to elaborate. I don't see a patient very often recover
from yellow fever that was covered with tartar, or any similar sort
of remedy.

Tartarization is a dangerous practice for yellow fever.

I knew early on, because it caused irritation of the stomach and small intestines. In one case,
emetics were used on a family I prescribed.

They were very sick from the fever, but with my aid they recovered.

Because of the experience this gave me, I more closely watched the effects of these in not
only my own practice, but the practice of my peers. I decided to entirely cease the use of tartar
emetics.

Ipecacuaha proved also to be a bad choice.

While it did not have the same effects as the tartar emetic, it caused a different kind of harm
and never any cures. All of these comments however refer to the use of emetics during the climax
of fever, and not during the collapse, during which it is sometimes reccomended to use by southern
doctors.

I have honestly never used it during that time, and I don't believe I could be persuaded to,
because during such states the digestive organs are far too fragile
to withstand such a powerful treatment 
It appears that the negatives
of emetics, particularly tartar emetics are at fault of their bad
qualities, but more importantly the vomiting they cause.

While vomiting the stomach muscles are compressed by the abdominals and are caused to contract.
Because of this, I believe that purgatives, while irriating in action, can be used to positive
effect in yellow fever. I have no intention to explain this strange phenomenon, that is the
task of others.

I am content in saying that during my many years of practice, I have
not seen a person die of yellow fever who had empty bowels, and who
sweated and was excited within a day after the attack.

I used purgatives in practically every instance every day, until
many evacuations had been made.

I discovered that gentler purges had better effect than the more
irritating purges.

Senna, mixed with lemon jucie or taarinds for acidity, worked very
well when the stomach could take it.

I often used castor oil, manna salts and magnesia, although i did
not extensively use calomel with this disease I precribed it to children
and adults whose stomachs were too sensitive for other purgatives.

When I had to use it, I used doses strong enough for a purgative
effect, and never to cause ptyalism.

I never feared excess salivation in this, because I knew ptyalism in malignant diseases is a positive
thing, however I knew that there was often not an excess salivation, and much time could be
lost.

In summary, purgative enemata were used in the early stages of the fever and followed by use
of emmolient decotion injections, which caused great relief and comfort
to the patient.

To remedy irritation, blisters and sinapisms were used. They were very effective.
 The language,
Singhalese has undoubtedly striking similarity- whether it is in
the spoken form or even more as a written language- with the languages
in use in the Dekkan regions of the Indian peninsula viz: Tamil, Telingu
and Malayalam.

The similarity is identified more on the analogy rather than on the structure of the languages.
This indicates that the existence of a common vernacular dialect, existed for the countries
any time in the history is unlikely!
During Wijayo's conquering of Ceylon in B.C. 543, the natives spoke a different language than
the one spoken by the conquerors, which must have been Pali as they came from Bengal those days
as attested by the Mahawanso. It appears that the relationship between the two regions was probably
introduced by the Buddhist monks who went there as they did many other parts of the world
to spread the teachings of the Buddha.
But several centuries later in A.D. 339 it appears that the dialect of the two races was still
different and consequently some of the sacred writings were to be
translated from Pali to Sinhala language.

At a still later period in A.D. 410 a learned priest from Magadha translated Attah-Katha from Singhalese
into Pali.
The Singhalese language at various times has been greatly enriched by other languages, especially
by Sanskrit and Pali with the former in greater measure. Nevertheless, it is presumed and
established that the influence of these external sources were largely of recent developments.

There appears to be an analogy between the relationship of Singhalese with Sanskrit and Pali,
and that of English of the present day with Latin, Anglo-Saxon and Norman French. Broadly speaking,
the words applicable to the objects connected with rural life are Anglo-saxon, while those indicative
of domestic refinement are French and those pertaining to science and religion are Latin. Similarly
in the language of Ceylon, the usages of the language are generally
derived from the way, that the terms related to the national religion
are from Pali, those of science and art from Sanskrit while those
catering to the day to day wants of the society are from Singhalese.

It is claimed that the preachings of the Buddha though had tremendous influence in the early
period, no traces of the teachings long survived him in the island nation. Also, it is further
claimed that the mass of the inhabitants were still aliens to his religion when the Buddha
was on his death bed in B.C. 543. During the same period Wijayo, the estranged son of a petty
chieftan in the vally of the Ganges, landed with a handful of followers in the outskirts of
Putlam. Here he married the daughter of one of the native chiefs and with the help of the in-laws
made himself the master of the island.

He founded a dynasty with its capital at Tamana Neuera to reign supreme in Ceylon for nearly
eight centuries to come.

 If bad upbringing is insignificant of a young poetâs nausea
at the sight of a toothbrush, then it is capable of being refined into an insight into life and of
being expressed by means of appropriate mechanism or illusion.

To register the mere facts of consciousness, not wholly absorbed
by the being, and without assessment or strengthening by the thought,
though it has something to do with poetry, can not be regarded any
better than just to write down the number of oneâs bus tickets.

 Cupping enables
one to clear one's mind and memory, and nothing is more relaxing
for the brain and eyes.

If said cupping falls on a Tuesday, then it will be even more puissant.

There must be a reasonable time in which cupping would work best. When would that be?
In order for the cupping to truly fortify both the wit and the memory,
it is best to complete the cupping when fasting. addition of new karman , new merit, new guilt

Looking back at this entire period, what becomes blindingly obvious, is that he was showing early
signs of his distint qualities and his unwaverying determination which he showed throughout
his time. It was an ability to fend for himself, that never-say-die attitude which in some people
could be seen as obstinancy and his foresight and natural inclination to view a case with
absolute clarity. And it was a love of country which welled within his heart and informed his
sense of responsibility despite the "whips and scorns that patient
merit of the unworthy takes".

This much was true throughout his days in quiety solitude at Burnham Thorpe- right up until
the end of his prestigious career.
It was at the age of twelve years that he joined his uncle on the Raisonably sixty-four and worked
as a midshipman for a period of five months.

Not many would have been able to see the heroic future ahead for this unremarkable looking youngster.
And the same was true for the future Bronte who, a few months later, would progress from midshipman
to the rank of a youngster taking passage on a West India ship.

It is this he tells us in the "Sketch of my Life," which was owned by the house of Hibbert, Purrier,
and Horton, where he would eventually retrun to the Triumph at Chatham as an exerperienced seaman. But
he also retained a disdain for the Royal Naby and a firm belief in the saying: "Aft the most honour,
forward the better man."
What we shall learn next is liable to shock readers of a certain disposition.

People who want their sons to rise to become admirals with little in the way of apprenticeship.
As this is an individual who the log books of the Triumph will tell us, acted as a "captain's servant"
for fourteen months. He did this by promising them that he would not wear any kind of uniform
and he would never have to brush the captain's jacket.
At the age of fifteen he would back the cockswain, even though his weight amounted to less that
five stone.
But the uncouth nature of the individual will be the end of us, and
our Laura Matilda will refuse to listen without an appalled reaction
to the "Death of Nelson".

we must consider its real elastic limit. By elastic limit we mean the fraction of the material's
total force that can be exerted in a continuous manner while keeping its ability to go back
to its former shape and position - its resilience - if we remove
the stress.

In the spiral coils, with its furnished steel wire, when we put a curve into the wire the available
sustaining poewr drops significantly.
We can see that it would be dangerous if we were to exceed these cables' elastic limit. For
example, should there be adverse weather conditions or a lot of people,
the bridge's limit would be exceeded.

Therefore, when this extra is taken away the bridge is not brought back to where it ws by the
cables - resulting in a weak, flat arch.
With Colonel Paine's invention, the New York and Brooklyn bridges were constructed using furnished,
not curved wire.

If we remove a bit of the common steel wire from the coil, it goes
back to its old curve if we pull it straight and then release.

If, however, we do the same to a section of the wire in the bridge that was straight-furnished
it goes back into its original, straight position.
We would be wrong to think if we straighten a curved wire, the particles at the inside of the
curve are distented and those on the outside compressed. Actually, the ones on the inside exceed
their elastic limit even before there is any outside stress.

Thus, when we pull the wire straight, we can only consider a fraction when we measure the elastic
limit for safe loading.

With curved, pull-straightened wire steel the total strength is only 90% in comparison to the
same wire that has been furnished straight. The reason iron wire is used for suspension bridges
is because of its increased ductility, which makes up for the distention
of the particles.

However, as there is no distention in straight steel wire, all of its elastic limit is available
to us, i.e two thirds of its ultimate strength and with an ultimate
strength 10% more than that of curved wire.

So, given a piece of curved steel wire that can handle 1,000 pounds without being destroyed,
a straight wire, just like those used in the bridge, will support
1,100lb.

Two thirds of this is 720lb.
As stress on curved wire would produce a straight line that goes further than the elastic limit
of the inside of its sectional area, its elastic limit is undeterminable. We can guess that
the elastic limit of curved iron wire is around 40% of its ultimate
strength.

This is about 50% of curved steel wire's ultimate strength, i.e. we cannot put more than 200lb,
or 40% of 500, on a curved iron wire despite the fact that a straight steel wire holds 720lb
without any problems. Talking about the New York and Brooklyn bridges, it would have been
around 200,000 dollars more to use the amount of iron wire as is
used in other suspension bridges as what was actually used, straight
steel wire.

The annual saving in interest, at five per cent, works out at ten thousand dollars.
And that's not counting the massive saving on care and painting, as
well as the non-bulky steel's natural beauty.

There must, too, be a considerable saving in the current expense
for painting and care, to say nothing of the more neat and elegant
appearance of the less bulky steel.

Plus, because the total area of this section of wire always gets an even load, we don't need
to worry about any change of structure through stress.
 

"Gladly," said he, "will I accumulate this tryst."

"Lord," said she, "remain in health, and be alert that thou accumulate thy promise; and now I

"Bestow me aloft him," said she, "and I will could could could cause that I shall never be his." "By

"In thy duke will I accord thee a baby bag," said she. "See that thou accumulate it well, and

Unto the hosts and the domiciliary will I accord the feast. And such will be thy acknowledgment

'Enough has been put therein;' and I will could could could cause

 His overall intention is the sole means of strength

One Newton's unqiue laws of motion is, that a body is required to forever continue a state
of rest, with inertia being a property of matter, or else remain
in motion in a continuously straight line, forever, so long as it
is not effected by a unique, external cause.

So, let's apply this rule to our planet, as a unique object, and record the outcome. First, what
was the reason for that we are put motion? The answer is another, unique agent or effort enabled
our body. And the next conclusion? An agency or unique effort is overcoming the original motion,
ultimately causing the departure from a straight line. Is the reason for this associated with other
planets and bodies? Perhaps, we could say, but is this good enough? Hardly, the rule has just
been simplified.

A pool ball is an object with the potential to effect another, but only with an agent pushing
it first, it cannot put itself in motion.

Here is the rule: an object or body will forever remain motionless unless a seperate agent acts upon
it. Now, moving from one planet to the next, each in order until arriving at the end of further
means, and ponder this question: as a property of matter, does inertia
qualify?

And then, does the law of motion therefore apply? And finally, if so, is there a requirement of
planets and other bodies beyond planets being an agent in order to
put them in motion?

Furthermore, carrying them forward in circles? Ha, and the fool says in his heart says "there is no God".

SUCH MISINTERPRETATION BY PRESENTDAY UNBELIEVERS AND IGNORANT MATERIALISTS.
Such people as these are significantly bound to a self-formed contradiction
of which there is no forfeiting.

Denying the eternity of matter, duration, space, and surely all the material philosophy carries
with it.
His guidance is: Space is real. It surely exists. Bounds are not applicable, and surely, it is
infinite.

Matter, too, is real. It cannot be destroyed, and does not decay, it is truly everlasting. 
Duration
is real, as well. I know this. Limitless, and ultimately infinite.
Surely there is no contest in finding the means upon which either
case founds it's thoughts. How so many of them can be wrong? They all are.

I am tired to my bones but if and when something get in my way on

Thursday. I seem to have had an altercation with police on Wednesday. I am not in jail but feeling
miserable and sorry. I must rain myself in. I am almost sure I gave way to my impulse and lost
control of myself. Talking to Brown (or whoever it is), I have been drunk as a mule on its
ass on the ground. Having him tell me that hurt me terribly. I can only excuse myself out of
peopleâs eyes. I did exactly that and with Brownâs assistance (or whoever he is) we drew
up an application to a retreat. It was what I needed, --- on the outset. I have missed too many
opportunities and this could be my last for a long time so, I and Brown (or whoever it is)
are making a show of it tonight.
Friday. Boots, again. Brown (or whoever he is) came over with two doctors. Despite my protesting
to Brown (or whoever he is) that I canât be bothered with but he
says I must.

I saw them and listened to what they have to say. They say I have to be cognizant of what
I do. I agree.

I am going into a retreat. I donât like to say a word âretreatâ with pronounced âreâ
and I say it should be said like it is one syllable. All right, it is a doctorsâ order.
Saturday. I am at a charming retreat, far away from drinking.

I should do well for next couple of weeks. I donât remember how long I agreed to stay in this
place but it has to be a considerable period. I have seen the Superintendent just now and he
says he is sorry to see me go but I canât stay. He was under the impression that I would stay
here for the rest of my life which I seemed to agree to as evidenced
in my signing the application to that effect.

I donât remember. I know I wanted to cure myself of being drunk all the time and I am hazy
about what I was doing the last week. Superintendent says he must sign me out under the statute.
It appears that I signed the application when I was drunk, not at all clued in. Nothing I can
do. I am going out. There are worse things than drinking, whiskey and wine and all. I have
feeling that I have a seat waiting for me at the bar. Another night in my boots. ***** ***** THE

 In 1827, fifty thousand books and treatises had been sent by a company
of the Sunday school alone. [204-A] There are few things more remarkable in the history of juvenile
literature that the growth of activity on Sunday American School of the Union. In 1828, he
had issued more than seven hundred of these religious trinkets, ranging
from a twelfth of sixteen pages to a small octavo volume, and most
of these appear to have been written by the Americans treat their
feathers experience in a literature is not recognized as difficult.

The influence of this tiny avalanche of books could hardly have been other than morbid, but sometimes

Leclerc printed the Ami des Lois, and he was requested by the adjutant to publish it on March
4, a day after the publication by Louallier. Following it came a notice that since New Orleans and
its surrounding area was under martial law it was therefore it was important that the section
be given the information so all would have it.
Jackson must have been very happy when others persuaded him that Louallier could be tried as a
spy.
He was prosecuted, Eaton tells us, as a person who should have been loyal to the United States.
Because he did owe that loyalty, Eaton says he shouldn't have been prosecuted as a spy. He was,
after all a legislator, meaning he certainly was a citizen. Citizens exhibiting such behaviors
as he was accused of should have been prosecuted on the bigger offense
of being a traitor.

This is the argument that Judge Martin gives, in a short but pithy
statement.

But, no matter which he was accused of, Louallier was
                    arrested on Sunday, March 5, at twelve noon by the Exchange Coffee
House.

He asked that the bar provide him legal relief and applied to our
author, Judge Martin, who was a member of the state Supreme Court.

However, the judge didn't think he had the proper jurisdiction
so didn't do anything. But Hall, who was District United States Judge,
was asked for a writ of habeas corpus and gave it. 
The General
was informed by the judge through his attorney of the writ. 
When
he got Morel's missive, Jackson was so angry that he lost control
