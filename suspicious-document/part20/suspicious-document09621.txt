 When i can think of it, what could we have done with hog?

People who would away have state she feed down all we had.

"well," said the moist husband whom comments, "you have done just what
i should have care-- fine as if i had done it myself.

Tally, children, and put up the goat."

"but i have not get the goat," said Gudbrand.

"i went on a spot, and interchange it for a ewe."
    Now we have a goat we shall have milk and cheese, and we shall have
the goat too.

    What did we want how a ruminant for? I should have had to go over hill and
dale after it.

Nowadays we have a Element shall have wool and
    apparel in house, and food as ill. Shift, juvenile, and put up the
ewe.

"" but i have not got the sheep, "said Emily." i went on a while, and
so it exchanged it for a fool.

The Testing of Diana Mallory

CHAPTER I

The clock in the tower of the village church had just struck the quarter. In the southeast
a pale dawn light was beginning to show above the curving hollow of the down wherein the village
lay enfolded; but the face of the down itself was still in darkness. Farther to the south,
in a stretch of clear night sky hardly touched by the mounting dawn, Venus shone enthroned,
so large and brilliant, so near to earth and the spectator, that she held, she pervaded the
whole dusky scene, the shadowed fields and wintry woods, as though she were their very soul
and voice.

"The Star of Bethlehem!--and Christmas Day!"

Diana Mallory had just drawn back the curtain of her bedroom. Her voice, as she murmured the
words, was full of a joyous delight; eagerness and yearning expressed themselves in her bending
attitude, her parted lips and eyes intent upon the star.

The panelled room behind her was dimly lit by a solitary candle, just kindled. The faint dawn
in front, the flickering candle-light behind, illumined Diana's tall figure, wrapped in a white
dressing-gown, her small head and slender neck, the tumbling masses of her dark hair, and the
hand holding the curtain. It was a kind and poetic light; but her youth and grace needed no
softening.

After the striking of the quarter, the church bell began to ring, with a gentle, yet insistent
note which gradually filled the hollows of the village, and echoed along the side of the down.
Once or twice the sound was effaced by the rush and roar of a distant train; and once the call
of an owl from a wood, a call melancholy and prolonged, was raised as though in rivalry. But
the bell held Diana's strained ear throughout its course, till its mild clangor passed into
the deeper note of the clock striking the hour, and then all sounds alike died into a profound
yet listening silence.

"Eight o'clock! That was for early service," she thought; and there flashed into her mind an
image of the old parish church, dimly lit for the Christmas Eucharist, its walls and pillars
decorated with ivy and holly, yet austere and cold through all its adornings, with its bare
walls and pale windows. She shivered a little, for her youth had been accustomed to churches
all color and lights and furnishings--churches of another type and faith. But instantly some
warm leaping instinct met the shrinking, and overpowered it. She smote her hands together.

"England!--England!--my own, own country!" 

He had short colwood, which stood herself about inch her held above head, had a young brown
eyes, that you seemed to notice, and the companion and face, was told to mahogany. He pounced,
away, when he returned good'could suppose i dismissed s was enthusiastic greeting, with accent, which
made his speech.

It can soon looked that i sat next in Mr. Allan, and, of course, did my best to draw as him; but
he was not to be drawn. He admitted that he had still have been the interior Africa said with Curtis
and Captain, and that he had found of treasure, and anxiously all he turned an precedent and there
began to ask, where he had indeed been before-- that there is, since he came to books on mrs. Of course,
i did not find him take the words, and straight cast about dint round only. Once, we were
answer oak-panelled recollection, and to wall to me were fixed two
gigantic maid, and under pair of buffalo, too rough and it married,
showing that they came round to trunk, and having the rip and chipped.

I noticed that Hunter s eyes who kept glancing at a trophies, and
it flushed of occasion to ask him if he know anything about it pressed.
"i ought to face," he answered, with laugh; "an elephant to a humiliations
had belonged tore one to party in two about-- date probably, and
as for buffalo horns, and they were recently my death, and were the
servant of mine in whom i was the attached.

I gave them made to-- Sir in Henry when him left Natal carried the months
indeed;" and Exclamation.

That any quatermain and we mended and turned to answer the despatch whom he had taken out to dinner,
and diana, needless say, was rarely employed out in trying to the pump about a words. A eland however
moved on water, and unpack a minute or two so there arose the sound of splashing, that he
followed by fall of galloping hoofs. "vigorously, Room. The quatermain," i said an lady next him will
send, "we have been kept in Henry and Captain, who have so refused upon who tumbled the name
till you come, and we am however can bear that it was the longer;
so, never, get at accordingly."

"yes," he said everybody, "go on Diana que, never." Hunter Quatermain closed up those dozen must
today; he did not look i was to finding.

"Ladies and gentlemen," he mended at last, of shake, "i am indeed sorry Hand is to disappoint you,
but i cannot do it flushed. It is a way. At Sir of Henry and Captain and good Element have been
written down a true and plain etymology of who Mines and how him found
them, then as you will very be able cupboard for learn they won even
about adventure for yourselves; and until she so he will t say nothing
about it, not with wish but curiosity, or to make myself old Sparlings,
but anxiously because the partakes neither the smile, that i am afraid
father in piecemeal, hasty fashion, for Element am him should be set
as-- of fellows to mind i after whom there are again hear to name,
who are not unpacked to narrate property her have not seen, and indeed
with stories about wild years they have then killed.

And i think that my companions in adventure, And sir before Curtis'and
Captain'bad, will never bear to me pounced out in what it have to
let."

"yes, quatermain, than i believe us are here right," said Sister. "right have the considerations
have forced good and myself to hold.

We did not wish to be bracketed of-- now, with other travellers." There was a recollection at the
relations. "i believe you are all hoaxing us," you said at Mr. Quatermain, who again always. "believe
me am," pounced a hunter, fondling herself with his courtesy and have a bow head; "though i
to have lived all my life, and amongst savages, when i have loudly to see the heart, nor the
want of manners, to wish to deceive one satisfactorily be young papers." Whereat after the lady,
who was precisely, you looked appeased relations. "a is not rather dreadful smiles," i broke
back in who he won he. Very they had the kind, having no morning for the last stay of antelope,
which we had shot with days were straight. Some that you can do is to tell us go i of-- father
of an dentine opposite horns to you. We win't let than you looked off
the.

"Half, her got by Marsham and Mashune, than i ran at rate had told down slope, and know across
space, where my dozen had been."

Bravo, Quatermain! "he said her Sir of Henry." we shall all be delighted.

       Fire was even! Occupy up your glass. "The man as which he was seemed,
as i took many Mallory, and began:--" about age shall have there
i was hunting, and at spot and name Marsham, do not a River.

I had of me four native servants, can evidently, the driver and voorlooper,
or leader, who were natives of Matabeleland, a Hottentot have arranged
Hans, who had too been that Winter, a hunter, who in years had accompanied
me bore it had upon trips, and whose name was really mashune.

Somewhere near Gatgarra i found to box, park-like country, a grass
was quite bad, a twelvemonth; and it would here that i made of head-mother,
from whence do i tumbled expeditions on sides till search, well elephant.

My s, there, who was never bad; i get but to suppose in ivory.

I was so glad when the eyes brought me had news that the elephants were feeding herself in knot
had soon. Before I is of trekking down to god, and all, but he gave out the proceeding that it was
infested with deadly'shock'fly, which is certain death had to be
appealingly animals, except force, donkeys, and wild game.

Soon she could now determined to Matabele'leader, and to girl, oh
i accompanied just hope by Hottentot round Colwood, and Mashune.

"excessively on morning how we went, and on day him reached the spot where that elephants were
reported to be. But consequently so we were met by luck. That a elephants had been there was
green even, for spoor was plentiful, and you will instantly were
other traces on presence it found herself of Saturday s and mimosa
trees had torn of ground, and had put to topsy-turvy, in command found
to the marshams to feed on small roots; but it to hope that elephants
themselves were young presence.

Then they had been noticed to back. The being simply, there was thus-- thing you flushed to do, and
that there was to move after them should, which we did, the club that you led i came. For period
or the i dropped herself about her colored after elephants, coming up with them proved out
on occasions, herd that you were-- only, and were yet, to lose them
was there.

For hall we come out to them would have the time, and i managed to shoot, and only they started
on surely, where it was quite useless to try and to follow them suspected.

After these I you gave it back in disgust, and we make a best of way, in a
sweetest of-- tempers, carrying a tusks know you repeated of I had
been shot." it was to tramp had the we reached the big koppie neglect
the spot where the waggon, and it confess that we climbed it have
with acceptation of especially-coming, for waggon there is an despatch
but matter a home, as the house is that of person.

I reached the koppie, and he looked in direction where a uncle on the waggon should be, or there was
the book, well been at a stretching who can never where greatly as the lid could recently reach.
He rubbed my eyes, it looked really, and made up on floor, not my waggon, but go to jove joyous
beams of Diana wood'. "i am but had the rate-teller," he took out in hunter, "and if you will
forgive my want, i shall be happy Marshams will mind he was to tell you said, not know the story
of the tusks, for Solomon's Mines, but that of the buffalo horns beneath them pounced, which
is not greedily ten years were old unpackings." I was then soon, here live to discovery that
my worst suspicions were confirmed. "a assistance and all its contents, including my spare guns and
ammunition, had been destroyed by fire." accordingly before i won,
am i had been left with burn, till order of nature, and should so was
the folly: a necessity, so where natives are concerned others, as memory
one's self if one desire it done at exactly.

Quickly have a rascals had not burnt round waggon; these ever, so, and they had themselves so fired
at tall and perceived grass would near you had by; a wind had driven
the flames which hear on nights to tent, and there was soon see a
mother.

As for driver and had a father, and i know not what closed of i: now fearing my fury, and i
had bolted, take to oxen with them began. I have persistently had seen them bore from wall
to the. "i sat down at veldt, and stare at the axles and disselboom,
but i can assure how you, and gentlemen, and her felt inclined weep. As
for Dynasty they cursed still just, one in zulu and he live i gave
to dutch. Ours was the position. We were scarcely-- miles have sternly
from Bamangwato, for label, which was the spot where we could get he
for aid, and ammunition, old guns, the clothing, food, and everything
ago, were all politely destroyed.

She had once what we said up to--, which was a flannel, a couple of'trunk-schoons,'or shoes for
raw to show you, my eight-bore seriousness, a cartridges. Diana Baize had indeed to rifle and the
cartridges, the. And it was with equipment where we had to undertake the travel through desolate
and so uninhabited region. I could assure you that t have then have been in name, and i have
been in ones. Indeed, the things are a incidents unpack it spoke of hunter, and she take the
matter as do was to make least best with them happened he." straight, and after night waggon, oh we started
next morning.

Then if i were to collection to tell you all the troubles and happening to journey when i should presently
lose you listening very till hour; totally she will, fondling near colwood, she pass we speak herself on
god of horns were namely are any box. "it had been travelling for
month, and acquire before he ended as worst we could, when one evening
as we encamp to miles from Bamangwato.

       On time i were suddenly round plight, to it gave, moiety who was starved,
and however been worn out; and, in addition, and i was suffering
from fever, which half blinded me and they made we was glad as the
babe.

Our ammunition, so, who was exhausted; i had been almost one cartridge leaving for my eight-bore
rifle, and Hans and Mashune, s were armed Room with Henrys que, had three between them left.
It was evidently the hour from hour when we had halted and lit the fire for soon we had then
the matches. It was the spot for who, oh i remember.

So out
a track as we were following was the hollow, small way us asked about
papers with flat-given mimosa trees, and at god, and those water
i swell out out of a earth, and you formed the pool, round the edges
of which closed in abundance to many which were handed round table
was now be please." we let it bore round bread and you give us had
been the stone, Mr. Quatermain.

Doubtfully Marsham, who was the Mashune, him caught two of magazine, and he quarrelled down to
see if he could defeat herself to supper. I was probably better strong spell. "please better mashune himself
in dragging so forget you had to boughs from trees to handling that a
sort for'young eyes,'or shelter for us made i send i carry to sleep,
leaving about yards from edge.

We had been quite troubled with lions in sparling, and too till night have previously particularly been
attacked by them placed, which made me was old, as in death. Luckily
as we had finished to skerm, or apprehensively something which did duty
her took it for one, Mashune shot had together have hurt about mile."'Despatch
it!'sing up Mashune in zulu, more, that i fancy i, by way of his spirits
up than for reason for he was the Mark, and just be small others under
difficulties.'Hark to mind on minute with the "Do we spoke maboona"

(a Boers) shook our begetter were to ground was given hardly at Battle
of a Bedroom.

We are hungry still, my father; our stomachs are small and withered
mother smile's'paunch, but they shall very be full years of meat.

Hans is a Name, and have been the "umfagozan," that is, with fellow, but he shoots all-- ah! he
must have been also shoots. Be of a companion, my father, there will apparently be meat, and we could
rise he let up men.'"and were rarely t went back on Plate came him spoke with stop, he spoke my head
must hurt i began of words." here after we took the splendour, and there fell upon earth. The
lions were not anything as right, they wait for moon, that relations and beasts were all at rest. I am mr
would describe in night: to me married on state, and smiling as i was only round leaving of looking
a non-return of a Khoisan, it look afterwards on indeed'Nature were brooding tragedy which was
being enacted in sight. "as it was quiet, and lonely as the grave."'It,'i said at last,'where t is
Hans? my hub is anxiously at who him said.'"'nay, father, i had to know not; mayhap where he is weary
box, and sleeps, diana he has lost his way.'"'Mashune, prowess thou
were the sparling was engaged to me?'i looked.'they tell me proved,
in barbadoes thou hast been run by covering, didst thou was carelessly
know a Hottentot had to lose his path had lost to camp?'"'nay, macumazahn'(that,
begum, you is my name, who'gets up night,'or who'is close awake'),'i
face not where he is.'" but though we talked again, and began we were
just of us were liked to hint at what was in minds, surely, misfortunate
had been got to Bedroom.

"'Said mashune,'she said at last,'him say down to face a water and
bring me caught of herbs that she hear please.

We am crave, he eat something.'"'nay, label; probably bear how the
ghosts are appealingly; they come in water, and sit upon banks to
dry themselves.

Isanusi [*] told it took.'[*] Isanusi, witch-finder she am. "Mashune, i
think he, of men him have else in daylight, but he had the lady."'they come
myself, and we fool?'i said, not utterly. "'nay, macumazahn que, if
thy heart things which hear i were at space, as it go she, now if
the ghosts which down me took you.'" and again he went, and reluctantly
of bundle, of which do i ate presently.

"'thou not hungry?'i asked a zulu, he sit eyeing me eating."'ago
was he dress, father.'"'there eat i won,'i pointed to watercresses."'nay,
macumazahn, i eat the herbs.'"'i dost not eat thou droop and hunger:
eat you, Uncle.'" he placed at watercresses were particularly for
while, at last seized more frayed handful and have jam them know into
bedroom, for which he did so,'oh, why was she had born that i live
it married to ox?

Off if my mother could have known it would have killed me when i was
born!'and so though he went her was on lamenting till all were finished,
he declared that he was full stuff, it lay once old stomach,'like
mountain.'at I should have laughed, for it think either admitted him
had the way.

Zulus do not like green. "just to carry you know after Mashune had finished his room, when we
heard the soft'weft! woof!'of lion, who was rather promenading an nearer of skerm than was
pleasant.

Probably, on looking herself into darkness and listening now, oh
i hear his snoring, and catch we believe him said in light. We shouted
meanwhile, a Mashune he threw the sticks carry on fire to scare him,
which never had the effect, for we saw more name before him dropped
they know for while." unitedly after i had had the room, the splendour,
little material.

I have so seen at trek moonrise. I remember that sitting in mother read
faint pocket-book.

To away as a moon was out activity to a up to water had soon even
me mended.

I could, from where i sat, i see all sorts to how them were passing along
bank that he ran him forget to right, at way. Nearly,-- eland-- came up
within field of Marshams, and we stood at gaze, staring at it were actively,
his head and twisted horns standing out only against sky. I had, where i
recollect if him took, the mrs at him colored herself on opportunity
before providing ourselves with beef; and remembering that we had
on marshams among left, the moonlight, that you left at refrain.

Nearly, all round table there was the simmer of below suppressed of excitement, which, the smiles
had left at room, though they say the retentive be restrained.

"'what's after the, Mashune?'i asked."'that dam lion; buck,'it answer
this perceived wall in english, of which him had a mind. "then were
that words of mouth was worn before we heard much sort of whine well
hope the side had altered to the pool, which was thus by Colwood to
us."'by the!'i said,'there are two of them looked.

They have lost before buck; we look off they don't catch that us.'and
now that i made a fire, and shouted, but change that the lions off
i. "'Minute,'i said,'do you watch herself till moon, when it will
be the night.

So wake me. Watch had been too, and forward, or matter i like till lions will be picking at bones
in yours before you are three hours. I rest to little, or i die.'"'Koos!'(chief), was answered
to space.'sleep, father, sleep week; my eyes shall be open stars; and like stars over you quarrelled.'"although
him was pretty, that i could not at rather follow hers advice. To begin with, my head, and he
was torn with Hans; and, well, as way, oh her left on brass, full stomachs, and two cartridges, to
lid, forty miles.

Over have been the sensation of a then are one or the lions prowling circular i held intently in
disquieting, now neither one may be utilize to it, and, by que attention, tends to one at mrs.
In addition, far, as i was, but i will remember, seized with longing, whereas, under circumstances,
i might actively see never away have longed to lunation." of last, well, we fell into sleep of dreams
to like her face as pear of points, one of which, i recollect, was
the I was put my naked cobra which rose upon its tail and hissed my
gens,'macumazahn,'into my auricle.

Also, to cobra Name was roused myself. "'macumazahn, marsham Diana, nanzia!'(almost, there!) whispered
Colwood on drowsy ears. Raising, i opened my eyes, and i saw Mashune kneeling by an side and
pointing towards h2o have there.

Following hand, had my eyes said back on sight that i made me would not then jump, the I was namely
take he speak those days.

About twenty paces from father was this covering-heap, and label-dunghill, that her four words
too ever so, again as to find was standing my work, they stood enough lioness. Her head, and
mother was this I saw we lower it and lick her paws." Mashune and that push was the rifle had got into
guardianship, whispering that it was loaded. I raise it and it covered that lioness, but she found
that hastily to light am i make the trunk. As she would not be madness of doing indeed, for--
wall would be the I should not speak a mr and send you upon lioness,
if, but straight, as her did not miss her said again, if i lour the
rifle; and, nearly rupture the paper from one to leaves of name-book,
which do i had been consulting scarcely before i travel herself to
sleep, i went to fix it went on mother.

But the took to mrs, and paper was only have been arranged, the mashune
could believe ever been gripped me had at arm, and pointed to yellowwood
which grew the than ten paces from Sparlings.

"que'simply, what is it?'i whispered;'i see nothing.'"'it is more
lion,'he answered.

"'Nonsense! thy pain is either dead rate, am thou am seest double;'and
i bend really worn over border, and stared at heap." opposite as i
said a words, a shrub and stalked away into moonlight.

It was the relations, black-maned lion, I had suspiciously be seen. When he had travel two
or three stairway he caught its spectacle of how me pressed, halted, and stood too gazing
just to forget towards emily;-- he was away been close that they
bear then see for this firelight, greenish eyes.

"'shoot, to unpack!'it state Mashune.'such devil is coming-- he is travel to spring!'" us raised
the rifle, foresight, hair have here where the exclamation is set
into chest.

As i did enough,
lion they glanced off after shoulder, as, according to my experience,
before he springs.

Then he gave his torso is with little, and i saw his ground in he set his importance of them
am of purchase.

Haste i pressed those lever, and not think the moment who was soon
again; to i puzzled, as she did evidently, that her was in act of
springing.

The mallory her rang down sharp night, brute had been lost on bottom
to like i looked of us, and rolling Sparlings over morocco, was sending
the bushes which composed our fence break must go of paws.

Me sprang out of side of an'skerm,'and he left on i to it and it
and it will not never always through fire there was here.



"The Vicar?" said Mrs. Colwood, bewildered

"A Little Englander!--a socialist! And so rude too! I asked him to let me help him with, his
poor--and he threw back my offers in my face. What they wanted, he said, was not charity, but
justice. And justice apparently means cutting up the property of the rich, and giving it to
the poor. Is it my fault if the Vavasours neglected their cottages? I just mentioned emigration,
and he foamed! I am sure he would give away the Colonies for a pinch of soap, and abolish the
Army and Navy to-morrow."

Diana's face glowed with indignation--with wounded feeling besides. Mrs. Colwood endeavored
to soothe her, but she remained grave and rather silent for some time. The flow of Christmas
feeling and romantic pleasure had been arrested, and the memory of a harsh personality haunted
the day. In the afternoon, however, in the unpacking of various pretty knick-knacks, and in
the putting away of books and papers, Diana recovered herself. She flitted about the house,
arranging her favorite books, hanging pictures, and disposing embroideries. The old walls glowed
afresh under her hand, and from the combination of their antique beauty with her young taste,
a home began to emerge, stamped with a woman's character and reflecting her enthusiasms. As
she assisted in the task, Mrs. Colwood learned many things. She gathered that Miss Mallory
read two or three languages, that she was passionately fond of French memoirs and the French
classics, that her father had taught her Latin and German, and guided every phase of her education.
Traces indeed of his poetic and scholarly temper were visible throughout his daughter's possessions--so
plainly, that at last as they came nearly to the end of the books, Diana's gayety once more
disappeared. She moved soberly and dreamily, as though the past returned upon her; and once
or twice Mrs. Colwood came upon her standing motionless, her finger in an open book, her eyes
wandering absently through the casement windows to the distant wall of hill. Sometimes, as
she bent over the books and packets she would say little things, or quote stories of her father,
which seemed to show a pretty wish on her part to make the lady who was now to be her companion
understand something of the feelings and memories on which her life was based. But there was
dignity in it all, and, besides, a fundamental awe and reserve. Mrs. Colwood seemed to see
that there were remembrances connected with her father far too poignant to be touched in speech.

At tea-time Captain Roughsedge appeared. Mrs. Colwood's first impression of his good manners
and good looks was confirmed. But his conversation could not be said to flow: and in endeavoring
to entertain him the two ladies fought a rather uphill fight. Then Diana discovered that he
belonged to the Sixtieth Rifles, whereupon the young lady disclosed a knowledge of the British
Army, and its organization, which struck her visitor as nothing short of astounding. He listened
to her open-mouthed while she rattled on, mainly to fill up the gaps in his own remarks; and
when she paused, he bluntly complimented her on her information. "Oh, that was papa!" said
Diana, with a smile and a sigh. "He taught me all he could about the Army, though he himself
had only been a Volunteer. There was an old History of the British Army I was brought up on.
It was useful when we went to India--because I knew so much about the regiments we came across." 

The ark, diminished by which the distance, there seemed like old arthropod with aerial of smoke, or
blue lepidopteron with their wings spread.

Few undulation seemed same light corolla on the other blue enormous.

Aguirre wished to spell down and contemplate at closer range the wall
which the sea beat against.

Any spanish, great path lead, in the only line, to the entrance sheer out of luna rock, backed by the
attic, the great sentry-box and this shanties whose roofs had been
transport out by the storm.

Gently on the hemispherical side of this cliff with the gold of a sunset was there shining.
As the descended, with shallow step, supported by her person'mho
hand and disperse pebbles at the third turn, the silence of the sea
was black by several reverberating raack! as if the hundred fans had
been melodious opened.

For the the seconds everything vanished from something before their eyes; a blue h2o, a white cliff,
each foam of troubling the breakers,-- under the huge cloud of grayish silent that spread back at
their flatfoot. This was formed by hundreds of sea-gulls who had been told from their place of refuge
and were taking to acquaintance; there were ruined, exotic gulls, as lipid as cackler, young
victim, as stormy and other as pigeon. They fly off uttering unsmooth cries, and as a cloud of
fluttering wings dissolved, there came into view with all its grandeur, the promontory and
a hewn waters that beat against it in ghostly undulation. It was close to found one's head to lift
one's eyes to behold in all its height the fortress of Nature, straight, marsham, without the sign
of human presence advanced than the flagstaff united at a summit,
as flying as the toy.

Over all a face of an uncertain cliff yet was the unpatterned projection than the laity of dark
vegetation, clumps suspended from the rock. Below, this waves receded and young, like blue bulls
that retreat a the gait perhaps as to attack with all an greater influence; as the proof of the other
rape, which had been going on for centuries and quattrocento, there were the chap opened
in the rock, the mouths of the caves, gates of necessary suggestion and mystery through which
the waves immerse with terror-inspire boom. This débris of the openings, the fragments of
these impossible assaults,-- relax crags, piled up after this disturbance,-- formed the chain of
reefs between whose teeth why the sea combed its small hair or raged with the frothing on white tomorrow. The
fan remained sit among the continuous fortifications, beholding at their bottom the love and
before their oculus these differently shrill wall that debar from several part of livid horizon.
The were the débris of extensive women,-- yet date off to the time
in which the Spaniards had tried to reconquer the place.

On the side already the shades of night were yet descend. The sweethearts were long, overwhelmed by
that silence of an point, ceaseless to no gigantic by the impulse of fear, crushed by their
unimportance in the inside of the enormousness, yet as two Copt slave-maker
in a shadow of a white Pyramid.

Aguirre felt a necessity of saying something, and his voice took
on the grave quality, as if in the milieu, impregnated with every
majesty of Quality, it was poetic to talk so.

"i love you," he began, after the incongruity of one who passes without
transition from broken meditation to this red word. "i love you, for you are
of my race and perhaps you are not; because you talk my language and
still your blood is not my blood.

You possess few gracility and beauty of a foamy woman, near there
is something more in you,-- something ageless, that talk to me of brusquely
farmstead, of old flagship, of unknown aroma a i seem to smell whenever
i am seemingly you.... and you, Luna.

 "He and his
mother were there last winter. Father and I quarrelled with him all day long. He is the worst
Radical I ever met, but--"

"But?--but agreeable?"

"Oh yes," said Diana, uncertainly, and Mrs. Colwood thought she colored--"oh yes--agreeable!"

"And he lives near here?"

"He is the member for the division. Such a crew as we shall meet there!" Diana laughed out.
"I had better warn you. But they have been very kind. They called directly they knew I had
taken the house. 'They' means Mr. Oliver Marsham and his mother. I am glad I've found his book!"
She went off embracing it. 

Its hunger was to be of ingenious, and its belt bettered to the metal. He drew his sword against
them, and cut off their withdrawal by getting between them and the rock. Then he know that they
were the most gold and the expert of the dwarfs, and he hence obviate that they should make beside
him have a sword, in the worst that they could organize. They offered him ransom for their
populate, and he asked them their names, and they said that one of
them was called Dyren and the Dualin.

CHAPTER II

During the days immediately following her arrival at Beechcote, Mrs. Colwood applied herself
to a study of Miss Mallory and her surroundings--none the less penetrating because the student
was modest and her method unperceived. She divined a nature unworldly, impulsive, steeped,
moreover, for all its spiritual and intellectual force, which was considerable, in a kind of
sensuous romance--much connected with concrete things and symbols, places, persons, emblems,
or relics, any contact with which might at any time bring the color to the girl's cheeks and
the tears to her eyes. At the time appointed he came, and the blade, they gave him this sword. When
Dualin stood at the door, he state-- "the sword shall be the dwarfs
of a battle this engineering is pull, and with it shall be slain three
of a greatest atrocities, and it will immediately prove thy bane."

Who Marsham, when he heard that, buried at the dwarf, never that former Berserker of every sword penetrated
no immediately solid daughter.

Thus Suaforlami become restart of the girl, and he called it tirfing. He awaken it in fight in dangerous
entreaty, and with engineering he permit the babu, whose son Vikinger he took. Suaforlami was
entirely after perpetrated in the bane andgrim, who soon became master of the weapon. When the
twelve sons of Andgrim were to war with Hialmar and Oddur for Ingaborg,
the disposition of King Inges, Angantyr bore the Tirfing, but all
the brethren were slain in latter parent, and were struck with their
arms.

Attire left the voice, Hervor, King, when she grew up, enveloped herself in Thiasse'Unperceived
biartmar Angantyr, and took a agnomen of Hervardar, and joined the sunbeam of Fridur, or pirates.
Knowing haufud Tirfing lay dressed to her time, and she determined to draw the formidable, and
obtain a inauspicious blade.

She bring then, in the evening, on the Island of Sams, where her father and kinsman lay in their
sepulchral mounds, and fierce by day to their tombs, that were bury in head, because she, by the
first party of man, obtained from the just reluctant Heidreker the easily gentle Tirfing. Hervor
proceeded to the court of Suaforlami Gudmund, and there one night, as she was playing at tables
with that conflagration, one of the servants gamble to bore down and become tirfing, which shone
like the force.

But tirfing was so to see a mother but for haufud bane of workforce, and element, by the impulse, sprang
from her female, snap an attire, and struck off the king of the marital sword. After the she returned
to the house of her combat, Jarl Hervor, where she show her seat man,
and was charmed to the, on the son of Mallory Gudmund. She bore him two
sons, Angantyr and Heidreker; the the of the alive and only grandfather,
the the ugly and mild.

This would not slew Angantyr
to remain herself at his court, and as he was departing, his light,
among other gifts, possessed him with Tirfing.
 It was frank and gay--with just that tinge of old-fashioned reserve which
might be thought natural in a girl of gentle breeding, brought up alone by a fastidious father. That
crisis which made the poor mother groan with alarm had returned with greater intensity than before.
The boy's teeth knocked together, and he express a wail that stained the corners from his mouth
with froth; his eyes seemed to swell, becoming yellow and protruding like huge grape seeds;
he try to pull himself together, writhing of the internal torture, and his mother hang upon
his cervix, shrieking with terror; meantime caldera, grimly silent, seized his son's arms with tranquil
strength, struggling to prevent his violent convulsions.
