The prophete Ionas/ with an introducciō before teachinge to vnderstōde him and the right
vse also of all the scripture/ and why it was written/ and what is therin to be sought/ and
shewenge wherewith the scripture is locked vpp that he which readeth it/ can not vnderstōde
it/ though he studie therin neuer so moch: and agayne with what keyes it is so opened/ that
the reader can be stopped out with no sotilte or false doctrine of man/ from the true sense
and vnderstondynge therof.

W. T. vn to the Christen reader.

As [the] ēvious Philistenes stopped [the] welles of Abraham ād filled them vpp with erth/ to
put [the] memoriall out of mīde/ to [the] entent [that] they might chalenge [the] grounde:
even so the fleshly mīded ypocrites stoppe vpp the vaynes of life which are in [the] scripture/
[with] the erth of theyr tradiciōs/ false similitudes & lienge allegories: & [that] of like
zele/ to make [the] scripture theyr awne possessiō & marchaundice: and so shutt vpp the kingdome
of heven which is Gods worde nether enterīge in thē selues nor soferinge them that wolde.

¶ The scripture hath a body with out/ ād within a soule/ sprite & life. It hath [with] out
a barke/ a shell ād as it were an hard bone for [the] fleshly mynded to gnaw vppon. And within
it hath pith/ cornell/ mary & all swetnesse for Gods electe which he hath chosen to geve them
his spirite/ & to write his law & [the] faith of his sonne in their hertes.

¶ The scripture cōteyneth .iii. thīges in it first [the] law to cōdemne all flesh: secōdaryly
[the] Gospell/ [that] is to saye/ promises of mercie for all [that] repent & knowlege their
sinnes at the preachīge of [the] law & cōsent in their hertes that the law is good/ & submitte
them selues to be scolers to lern to kepe the lawe & to lerne to beleue [the] mercie that is
promised thē: & thridly the stories & liues of those scolars/ both what chaunces fortuned thē/
& also by what meanes their scolemaster taught thē and made them perfecte/ & how he tried the
true from the false.

¶ When [the] ypocrites come to [the] lawe/ they put gloses to ād make no moare of it then of
a worldly law which is satisfied with [the] outwarde worke and which a turke maye also fulfill.
Whē yet Gods law never ceaseth to cōdemne a man vntill it be written in his herte and vntill
he kepe it naturally without cōpulsion & all other respecte saue only of pure love to God and
his neyboure/ as he naturally eateth whē he is an hongred/ without cōpulsiō & all other respecte/
saue to slake his hongre only.

¶ And whē they come to the Gospell/ there they mīgle their leuen & saye/ God now receaueth
vs no moare to mercie/ but of mercie receaueth vs to penaunce/ that is to wete/ holy dedes
[that] make them fatt belies & vs their captiues/ both in soule and body. And yet they fayne
theyr Idole [the] Pope so mercifull/ [that] if thou make a litle money glister in his Balams
eyes/ there is nether penaunce ner purgatory ner any fastīge at all but to fle to heven as
swefte as a thought and at the twinkellynge of an eye.

¶ And the liues stories and gestes of men which are cōtayned in the bible/ they reade as thīges
no moare perteynīge vn to thē/ then a take of Robī hode/ & as thīges they wott not wherto they
serue/ saue to fayne false discāt & iuglinge allegories/ to stablish their kingdome with all.
And one [the] chefest & fleshliest studie they have/ is to magnifie [the] sayntes aboue measure
& aboue [the] trueth & with their poetrie to make them greater then euer God make them. And
if they finde any infirmite or synne asscribed vn to [the] saintes/ that they excuse with all
diligēce/ diminushīge the glorie of [the] mercie of God & robbinge wretched sinners of all
theyr cōforte/ & thinke therby to flater the sayntes and to obtayne their fauoure & to make
speciall aduocates of thē: even as a man wold obtayne [the] fauoure of wordely tirantes: as
they also fayne the saintes moch moare cruell then ever was any heathē man & moare wrekefull
and vengeable then [the] poetes faine their godes or their furies [that] torment [the] soules
in hell/ if theyr euēs be not fasted & their images visited & saluted wyth a Pater noster (whych
prayer only oure lippes be accoynted with oure hertes vnderstōdinge none at all) and worsheped
[with] a candell & [the] offerīge of oure deuociō/ in [the] place which thei haue chosen to
heare [the] supplicaciōs & meke peticiōs of their clientes therin.

¶ But thou reader thīke of [the] law of God how [that] it is all to gether spirituall/ & so
spirituall [that] it is neuer fulfilled [with] dedes or werkes/ vntill they flow out of thyne
herte [with] as greate loue toward thy neyboure/ for no deseruīge of his ye though he be thine
enimie/ as Christ loued [the] ād did for the/ for no deseruīge of thyne/ but evē whē thou wast
his enimie. And in [the] meane time/ thoroute all our infancie & childhod in Christ/ tyll we
be growen vpp in to perfecte men in the full knowlege of christ & full loue of christ agayne
& of oure neyboures for his sake/ after [the] ensample of his loue to vs/ rembenbir that [the]
fulfillynge of [the] law is/ a fast fayth in christes bloud coupled [with] our professiō &
submyttīge our selues to lerne to doo better.

¶ And of [the] Gospell or promises which thou metest in [the] scripture/ beleue fast [that]
God will fulfill them vn to [the]/ and that vn to [the] vttemost Iott/ at the repentaunce of
thyne herte/ whē thou turnest to hym & forsakest euell/ even of his goodnesse & fatherly mercie
vn to the/ ād not for thy flatterīge hym with ypocritish workes of thyne awne fayninge. So
[that] a fast faith only with out respecte of all workes/ is the forgeuenesse both of the synne
which we did in tyme of ignoraunce with luste ād cōsent to synne/ & also of all the synne which
we doo by chaunce & of frailte/ after [that] we are come to knowlege ād have professed [the]
law out of oure hertes. And all dedes serue only for to helpe oure neyboures & to tame oure
flesh that we fall not to synne agayne/ & to exercice oure soules in vertue/ & not to make
satisfaction to Godward for [the] synne [that] is once paste.

¶ And all other stories of [the] bible/ with out excepciō/ are [the] practisinge of [the] law
& of the Gospell/ and are true and faitfull ensamples & sure erneste [that] God will euen so
deale with vs/ as he did with thē/ in all infirmities/ in all temptaciōs/ & in all like cases
& chaunces. Wherin ye se on [the] one syde/ how fatherly & tendirly & with all cōpassion god
entreateth his electe which submitte them selues as scolers/ to lerne to walke in the wayes
of his lawes/ & to kepe thē of loue. If they forgatt thē selues at a time & wēt astraye/ he
sought thē out & sett thē agayne with all mercie. If they fell & hurte thē selues/ he healed
thē agayne with all compassion & tendernesse of hert. He hath ofte brought greate tribulation
& aduersite vppon his electe: but all of fatherly loue only/ to teach thē & to make them se
their awne hertes & [the] sinne [that] there laye hid/ that they might aftirwarde feale his
mercie. For his mercie wayted vppon thē/ to rid them out agayne/ assone as they ware lerned
& come to [the] knowlege of their awne hertes: so that he neuer cast man awaye how depe so
euer he had sinned/ saue thē ōly which had first cast [the] yocke of his lawes frō their neckes/
with vtter diffiaunce & malice of herte.
