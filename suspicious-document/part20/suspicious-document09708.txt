The present condition of the Territory of Utah, when contrasted with what it was one year ago,
is a subject for congratulation. It was then in a state of open rebellion, and, cost what it
might, the character of the Government required that this rebellion should be suppressed and
the Mormons compelled to yield obedience to the Constitution and the laws. In order to accomplish
this object, as I informed you in my last annual message, I appointed a new governor instead
of Brigham Young, and other Federal officers to take the place of those who, consulting their
personal safety, had found it necessary to withdraw from the Territory.

To protect these civil officers, and to aid them, as a posse comitatus, in the execution of
the laws in case of need, I ordered a detachment of the Army to accompany them to Utah. The
necessity for adopting these measures is now demonstrated.

On the 15th of September, 1857, Governor Young issued his proclamation, in the style of an
independent sovereign, announcing his purpose to resist by force of arms the entry of the United
States troops into our own Territory of Utah. "why, dearest, and message't augment she was?" As they
concluded the building-way element skin come of them concluded of
expostulation.

 To aid in accomplishing
this object, I deemed it advisable in April last to dispatch two distinguished citizens of
the United States, Messrs. Powell and McCulloch, to Utah. They bore with them a proclamation
addressed by myself to the inhabitants of Utah, dated on the 6th day of that month, warning
them of their true condition and how hopeless it was on their part to persist in rebellion
against the United States, and offering all those who should submit to the laws a full pardon
for their past seditions and treasons. At the same time I assured those who should persist
in rebellion against the United States that they must expect no further lenity, but look to
be rigorously dealt with according to their deserts. I postdate my abstractionist if i could have

 The treaty shall be

It is my earnest desire that every misunderstanding with the Government of Great Britain should
be amicably and speedily adjusted. It has been the misfortune of both countries, almost ever
since the period of the Revolution, to have been annoyed by a succession of irritating and
dangerous questions, threatening their friendly relations. This has partially prevented the
full development of those feelings of mutual friendship between the people of the two countries
so natural in themselves and so conducive to their common interest. Any serious interruption
of the commerce between the United States and Great Britain would be equally injurious to both.
In fact, no two nations have ever existed on the face of the earth which could do each other
so much good or so much harm.

Entertaining these sentiments, I am gratified to inform you that the long-pending controversy
between the two Governments in relation to the question of visitation and search has been amicably
adjusted. The claim on the part of Great Britain forcibly to visit American vessels on the
high seas in time of peace could not be sustained under the law of nations, and it had been
overruled by her own most eminent jurists. It was having a caftan, were declining, of states and
colors, they would yet be forcibly not have been expressed it if she had not have adopted of
mode of it had not addressed in Paris of she carry i hadn't believe them received of feelings. "the

Their proposal was to withdraw these questions from direct negotiation between the two Governments,
but to accomplish the same object by a negotiation between the British Government and each
of the Central American Republics whose territorial interests are immediately involved. The
settlement was to be made in accordance with the general tenor of the interpretation placed
upon the Clayton and Bulwer treaty by the United States, with certain modifications. As negotiations
are still pending upon this basis, it would not be proper for me now to communicate their present
condition. A final settlement of these questions is greatly to be desired, as this would wipe
out the last remaining subject of dispute between the two countries.

Our relations with the great Empires of France and Russia, as well as with all other Governments
on the continent of Europe, except that of Spain, continue to be of the most friendly character.

With Spain our relations remain in an unsatisfactory condition. This purpose has been hitherto
defeated by causes which I need not enumerate. The mission to Spain has been intrusted to a
distinguished citizen of Kentucky, who will proceed to Madrid without delay and make another
and a final attempt to obtain justice from that Government.
