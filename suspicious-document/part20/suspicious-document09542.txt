<b>HAMMOND, GERTRUDE DEMAIN.</b> Several prizes at the School of the Royal Academy, 1886, 1887,
and in 1889 the prize for decorative design; bronze medal at Paris Exposition in 1900. Member
of Institute of Painters in Water-Colors. Born at Brixton. Go to if it is! Because
I was not deceived! Medium to medium. And it was assumed that there was no more but come and
kiss. Or is it not that VS takes the issue where most burning, which if we were to spearhead?
I'm not sure, I think nothing else, Mr don Fernando. -Even though
it is always a serious thing (said the Mayor with his usual equanimity),
launch order of imprisonment against an individual any that only suspected
of having committed an offence, that is not what stops me in the present
case; stop me the fact that you with his frank statement I have removed
the hold that could lend hand to proceed with the appearance of legality.

From me you hold and will I serve the best win, but I know I am going to cause annoyance to friend
Leonardo, contributing to the plagiarism of her friend. -Damn grab! He said don CÃ¡ndido for
himself. Because it does not appear when nona? Then added high: tables without knots or alabeos,
Mr don Fernando, TratÃ¡rase or bricks without Caliche, or Texas without question, and I have
V. S. smarter than a gyrfalcon. What is I reached me of judicial bathtub?
Or jota.

Why
V. S. who knows both, does not give a cut to the business and me
out of the quagmire? -Because it would not be that legal, or appearances,
would be covered at least in the minds of the judge.

The suggestion must come from you Meanwhile I was thinking, Mr don CÃ¡ndido, suppose you I arrest
warrant, that you turned on the girl, which puts it in the prison or manages you hide her for some
time. Has you thought about the consequences? -Consequences! repeated the surprised landowner.
Faith that I have not thought about it.

It neither occurs to me that you bring me consequences step... unless there is a fool who comes
to his defense. -Precisely because I think that the defenders sobrarÃ¡n you, I say what I say.
-Therefore do not have said to S. V. poor, obscure, unknown, orphan, alone in the world...? -Also
I was told you of her two things that are worth more than money,
birth, parentage and good relations: I contract job to her youth and
beauty.

You remember the words of Cervantes; they come here of mould: ' that
also the beauty has strength to awaken the sleeping charity".

With such gadgets is not never alone in the world. -Against this
judgment of don Quixote, there is this one which I do not know who
he is: "Holy which is not seen, is not worshipped".

DÃ­golo, because if I can catch it,
that I put it where has V. S. did not see or birds. -I repeat to
you that the thing is not as easy as it seems at first sight.

NI does her where would you that
no one hear her, saw her, her compadeciese and her amparase?

Leonardo,
if it is really in love with her, will be the first to declare its champion,
her will seek, will find it and will save her, badly that despite
them their captors.

Do not be, therefore, more right, more sane and reason, that still
get the girl in his house and does not provoke a conflict?


She executed a picture of the "Battle of Issus," which was exhibited in the Temple of Peace,
in the time of Vespasian, 333 B. C.

<b>HERBELIN, MME. JEANNE MATHILDE.</b> Third-class medal, Paris Salon, 1843; second class,
1844; and first class, 1847, 1848, and 1855. Born in Brunoy, 1820. A painter of miniatures.
One of these works by Mme. Herbelin was the first miniature admitted to the Luxembourg Gallery.

<b>HEREFORD, LAURA.</b> 1831-1870. This artist is distinguished by the fact that she was the
first woman to whom the schools of the Royal Academy were opened. Now I remember that long ago took Montes de Oca father to hire the same time Mary,
wife of the chef, to raise a child, illegitimate daughter of a friend. And here's the mistake decipher
why Dionysus. Studied under Darnaut in Vienna,
where she made her home. She is a landscape painter and is known through her "Evening Landscape,"
"Spring," "Eve," and a picture of roses.

<b>HEUSTIS, LOUISE LYONS.</b> Member of Art Workers' Club for Women and the Art Students' League.
Born in Mobile, Alabama. Pupil of Art Students' League, New York, under Kenyon Cox and W. M.
Chase; at Julian Academy, Paris, under Charles Lasar.

A portrait painter. At a recent exhibition of the Society of American Artists, Miss Heustis's
genre portrait called "The Recitation" was most attractive and well painted. She has painted
portraits of Mr. Henry F. Dimock; Mr. Edward L. Tinker, in riding clothes, of which a critic
says, "It is painted with distinction and charm"; the portrait of a little boy in a Russian
blouse is especially attractive; and a portrait of Miss Soley in riding costume is well done.
These are but a small number of the portraits by this artist. She is clever in posing her sitters,
manages the effect of light with skill and judgement, and renders the various kinds of textures
to excellent advantage.

As an illustrator Miss Heustis has been employed by St. Nicholas, Scribner's, and Harper's
Magazine.

<b>HILL, AMELIA R.</b> A native of Dunfermline, she lived many years in Edinburgh. White or in color?
All this is force us to know before proceeding to the graduation of the fault of both and
the application of the penalty you may be in justice. -Say to V.
S., Mr Mayor, with loyalty as I know in this particular case, said
Gamboa hesitated and with burning ears of shame.

The girl is young, quite young, and that you will only have 18 years of age. It has not been married;
nor, to what I understand, you can calificÃ¡r is her of ugly, rather of pretty, real girl, I would
say. It is poor, Yes, poor, poor thing, and color, but it will pass through white where you want to
not know their history... - well, perfectly, replied the pensive
Mayor.

That you learned of the case are known. So I like. We can already judge informed... Occurs only
a vacuum, call it doubts, namely: do you know the facts it sets out,
by himself or by third party reference? -Some I know myself, others,
say, by inference. -Let us.

First, tell you if you know who lives with the couple. -Now, I guess
that with a friend of hers. -None of assumptions, Mr don CÃ¡ndido.

You know you?

Yes or no? -No, Lord, I do not know, I inferior. -That I like. In this
class of business openness must come first. The lawyer and the judge should
talk to them as it speaks to the Confessor, with the heart in the
hand.

And earlier, who lived the pardita? -With the grandmother. -Do your
parents live?

Do
you have relatives, friends, protectors in sum, someone to do it?

Being so pretty, as you say, well it is knowing all this, find out
in time. -Little has died the grandmother.

The mother (added tottering and more red than ever), the mother...
Really I don't know at this time if you live or if he dies.

In any case, anything you would be worth if I lived.

With regard to the father... She does not you have known... She is
the daughter of the Royal House cradle.

Is V. S.? -Good.

Did you hear the grandmother of person? -Yes, Sir, I met her, although
I never had intimate dealings with her.

It would be long referred and alien here dwell on details. I know, however, that for women of
color (Brown era) led exemplary lives, which practiced the virtue,
which is confessed and Zoological often, he bred to the granddaughter
in Holy fear of God, which was monitoring her closely, and above all,
that the non consenting holgorios, dalliances with mozuelos or processions
of window. -Then the girl in question is well bred, living honest
and he has not even what to say. -This is the truth; only that, as
of hybrid race, should not be much trust in his virtue.

It is mulatilla and you know that daughter of gata, mice kills, and
which do jump the goat, jump which mama. -Well said.

We confess that our proverbs contain great wisdom Fund.

We also confess that our mulatas, generally speaking, are fragile by nature and by the desire, ingÃ©nito
in human creatures, ascend or improving condition. And here are the
key to decrypt the why of their hobby to the whites and their esquivez
towards men of his own race.

Good to talk to the person who should understand me.

No one like you who, by his long residence in the country, already
it has aplatanado, will have had better opportunities of observing
the idiosyncrasies of our kind of free color.

But a general rule, a strong presumption, a theory, plausible and brilliant as it may seem,
on the nature or hobbies or esotras people, is not done, unreported
crime, not even quasi-judicial-crime, which is what they penan laws
and judged and punished the courts of justice.

Â«We sum.Â»

You appear before me, the Mayor, in complaint against the ValdÃ©s to who accuses you of the quasi
crime of seduction and distraction inferred to his eldest son from you, which is still under parental
authority. Thus, calls you launch a warrant of imprisonment against the seductive, and that, without hearing
her, is her punished, depriving them of their freedom. I agree. So far there is no apparent irregularity,
the complaint is well founded in law, and you will have excellent
to not consent that a pervert to his son, much more when he follows
a career as honorable and noble as the toga

 In the same year,
at the "Livre Esthetique," in Brussels, her pictures were thought to combine a charming grace
with a sure sense of light effects, in which the predominating tone was a deep silver gray.
A portrait by this artist was exhibited at a Paris Salon in 1895.

<b>HOFFMANN, FELICITAS.</b> Born in Venice, she died in Dresden, 1760. Pupil of Rosalba Camera.
There are four pictures in the Dresden Gallery attributed to her--"St. George," after Correggio;
"Diana with an Italian Greyhound," after Camera; "Winter," a half-length figure by herself;
and her own portrait. Her principal works were religious subjects and portraits.

<b>HOFFMANN-TEDESCO, GIULIA.</b> Prize at the Beatrice Exposition, Naples. Born at Wurzburg,
1850. This artist has lived in Italy and made her artistic success there, her works having
been seen in many exhibitions. Her prize picture at Naples was called "A Mother's Joy." In
1877 she exhibited in the same city "Sappho" and "A Mother," which were much admired; at Turin,
1880, "On the Water" and "The Dance" were seen; at Milan, 1881, she exhibited "Timon of Athens"
and a "Sunset"; at Rome, 1883, "A Gipsy Girl" and "Flowers." Her flower pictures are excellent;
they are represented with truth, spirit, and grace.

<b>HOGARTH, MARY.</b> Exhibits regularly at the New English Art Club, and occasionally at the
New Gallery. Born at Barton-on-Humber, Lincolnshire. Pupil of the Slade School under Prof.
Fred Brown and P. Wilson Steer.

Miss Hogarth's contribution to the exhibition of the New English Art Club, 1902, was called
"The Green Shutters," a very peculiar title for what was, in fact, a picture of the Ponte Vecchio
and its surroundings, in Florence. It was interesting. It was scarcely a painting; a tinted
sketch would be a better name for it. It was an actual portrait of the scene, and skilfully done.

<b>HORMUTH-KOLLMORGEN, MARGARETHE.</b> Born at Heidelberg, 1858. Pupil of Ferdinand Keller
at Carlsruhe. Married the artist Kollmorgen, 1882. This painter of flowers and still-life has
also devoted herself to decorative work, mural designs, fire-screens, etc., in which she has
been successful. Her coloring is admirable and her execution careful and firm.

<b>HOSMER, HARRIET G.</b> Born in Watertown, Massachusetts, 1830. Pupil in Boston of Stevenson,
who taught her to model; pupil of her father, a physician, in anatomy, taking a supplementary
course at the St. Louis Medical School.

Since 1852 she has resided in Rome, where she was a pupil of Gibson. He Also Told Me That I Saw When I Crawled, He Knew It
Was My Mother And I Knew That My Father, As His Own Hands. - You

Nonsense! - Ah! Said Look, Cecilia Recalls, Said That His Wife Was

Paints genre subjects, some of which are "Captain John," in National Museum; "Laughing Child,"
in C. P. Huntington Collection; "Who Comes?" in private hands in Denver, etc.

Mrs. Hudson's pictures of Indians, the Pomas especially, are very interesting, although when
one sees the living article one wonders how a picture of him, conscientiously painted and truthful
in detail, can be so little repulsive--or, in fact, not repulsive at all. At all events, Mrs.
Hudson has no worthy rival in painting California Indians. Of course, you were not, but who takes the very beast of the error? Neither
had been born then. For you see, after that María Adela Rule raised by about two years. What
I can tell you is that the raising cost him much distress to mother. Montes de Oca agreed to
pay two ounces of gold to dad for the rental price of Mary Rule. I suspect never served because
he is a bad payer. Hallo, therefore, strange, incomprehensible, Montes de Oca you pass an allowance Vds.
Do you not know its origin?

- I do not understand, "replied Cecilia doubtful.

- I mean, "said Leonardo, if you know the reason, reason, or whatever,
the why he spent the counter to your grandmother.

- I do not know,
or rather, since I have not ever find out.

- You know and do not
want to tell me.

I read in your eyes.

- Mal reader you then.

- I deny standing tiptoe Montes de Oca passed the counter on their
own.

- I also deny.

- Ah!

See? You know and I negabas.

- Vd. I asked that.

You asked me if I knew the origin or reason for the allowance, and
I'm still fasting.

All I know is that Montes de Oca was spent on behalf of a friend
...

- That you know.

No? Leonardo interrupted.

- In sight, said Cecilia half.

Your name.

- Ay! That is left for the curious reader.

- Say it, say, he urged the young man taking his hand.

Not want to know out of curiosity, but for something that'll tell
you later.

- Vd. known as their hands.

- Who, then?

- His father
you

- My father!

Leonardo said amazed at the revelation.

Is it possible that my father carried pertinacity ....! (He caught himself and added then:) Are you
sure?

- Surefire.

- How long have you known him?

- Ugh! Since I was little.

- How do you know?

- You saw it on the
streets. Each time he stumbled. When I least expected it overhead.
He would brave and told me many things: he was made a Mataperros,
lost, badly brought up, and was going to make me catch on the soldiers.

-
Did you know his name then?

- No, not know until much later when
I had become a woman. Me has not been his friendship with another
mommy. From Corpus to San Juan, used to talk through the window, always
me.

- What's it say?

- Not good indeed. Though neither of
them has been before the public for any considerable period, they have already, by a succession
of notable works, earned the right to an amount of attention which, as a rule, can be claimed
only by workers who have a large fund of experience to draw upon. But though they have been
more than ordinarily successful in establishing themselves among the few contemporary painters
whose performances are worth watching, they have not sprung suddenly into notice by some special
achievement or by doing work so sensational that it would not fail to set people talking. There
has been no spasmodic brilliancy in their progress, none of that strange alternation of masterly
accomplishment and hesitating effort which is apt at times to mark the earlier stages of the
life of an artist who may or may not attain greatness in his later years. If you had heard of when he went to the mountain behind the white girl ... would know who
she is .-- quedré not in my life! He will never see my face. Although I kneel, though I kiss
your feet, do not forgive him that made me.
