"What you been doing to-day?" she asked, as talk flagged. He told her. He told her a great
deal more about himself, and about his aunt. He had had the most marvellous adventures. Sally
could not believe them all; but she was charmed by the narrative. Toby talked more freely.
He hesitated less, and was more confident. Sally felt sure he must have known other girls.
You didn't talk like that if you were new to it. She was again curious. Once she almost blurted
out the question; but she stayed the words in time. It would have been a mistake to ask anything
at this stage. It would have seemed possessive. It might have alarmed him. Anyway, she thought,
if he has, what does that matter? To her it was an added pleasure, that he might be wise and
experienced. It was a greater flattery; it called for greater resource in herself.

Once, when they had stopped and Sally had stood close to him so that he might light a fresh
cigarette under the shelter of her body, Toby blew forth a puff of smoke and put his arm round
her. Very coolly did Sally free herself, perfectly mistress of the situation; but she liked
him the better for his boldness. It was the sort of thing she had dreamed--a lover who was
ardent, a lover who had to be repelled, so that the delight of ultimate surrender should be
fully savoured. Was he a lover? Sally shivered. The attempt and the rebuff made them more intimate,
as though an understanding had been reached between them. They walked along elbow to elbow,
at first silent, and then talking freely, both in good-humor and with continued interest. In
the safe darkness Sally's eyes glistened. The very faintest smile made her mouth enigmatic.
Already she carried herself with fresh assurance. She was conscious of her power, and altogether
resolved to maintain it by prudence.

viii

All this time Toby had never seen Sally in daylight. He had seen her in a glimpse under the
flickering hall gas, and again from time to time in the shine of street lamps; but he had never
once been with her in daylight. She herself was conscious of this, at first accidental, but
now deliberate, mystification; and she dreaded the disclosure that was bound to come. It was
not, she knew, that she was ugly; but only that to a man like Toby her small face and sandy
hair might mark her down and ruin everything. She feared to notice a change in him, a change
from their present and increasingly confidential relation to an indifference, a contempt, which
she might find unbearable. The feeling was acute. It was not solely due to dependence upon
Toby, but was a part of her long-suffered self-disparagement and a fear, almost fatalistic,
that she could never keep a man's interest. The fear grew more intense as she fell into the
bitter-sweets of a lover's doubtings. The day must come, and then what would happen? She longed
to twine herself into his life before he could see her clearly. Perhaps then he would not notice?
Perhaps even now he knew, and did not mind?

That was one mood. Another was a recognition of her own piquancy. In this stronger mood, she
concentrated upon her own prettiness, the slimness of her body, her power to please him. But
the confidence did not last, because he had become a necessity to her. Having half-determined
to snare him, Sally was herself snared by the gins of love. She was hard, but she was soft.
She was cold, but she was warm. And as each day she used the sewing machine or roughly stitched
the raw material for Miss Jubb's costumes, Sally always looked to the nights. When it rained,
and she had to stay indoors, she chafed irritably and went early to bed. When she met Toby
she was full of unwonted high spirits. For a long time she did not know what had happened to
her. Then at last the truth flashed out one morning as she lay in bed, and with a little laughing
sound Sally knew that she was in love.

She was in love. And Toby, how did he feel? A new stage had been reached, when her caution
was directed to an altogether different end. She did not now seek so coolly to play with his
inclinations. She had great need for care lest she should betray her own secret. The occasional
contacts with him had become an eager need, and must be checked so as to make them appear as
accidental as they were deliberate. Sally was not withholding from coquetry, but from dread
lest she should give herself away and show herself over-willing. She noticed everything he
did, without watchful scrutiny, and with the merest quickness of her caressing glance. She
loved everything in him, his speech and his movements, his strength, his stubbornness, his
rough carriage and silence. She loved him. She feared him. She did not dare to risk losing
him. Above all, she longed to be in Toby's arms, to be desired by him.

Once, when she was examining her face in the mirror, and trying to imagine just how pretty
Toby might be made to think her, Sally lost her nerve. She was tearful all that day, tearful
and speechless, so that a rebuke from Miss Jubb brought about a real fit of crying. Miss Jubb,
astounded at such a collapse, instantly abandoned blame and showed true kindness of heart,
while May Pearcey looked on with round saucer eyes above her round apple cheeks. And Sally
went home early, ashamed of herself, once more irritable to viciousness, and spent the time
before her mother's return lying upon the bed and trying to sleep. There was no walk that night. The

 She was now in high spirits. All
sorts of funny things came into her head--things she had seen and thought since their last
meeting; and when she repeated them the Barrows laughed in great roars that filled her with
conceited exultation. It was so long since she had laughed. It was so long since she had fed
properly. This was like a dream, a riotous dream of noise and colour. She looked from old Perce's
red face to Mrs. Perce's almost equally florid cheeks, her eyes travelling like dragon-flies,
as bright and eager as possible.

And all the time she was taking in Mrs. Perce's appearance. Mrs. Perce wore a black silk dress,
very plain, but well-cut. She had a gold brooch at her throat, and a thin gold chain round
her neck. Her hair was abundant, and was dressed in a great blob upon the top of her head.
It was a noticeable colour, fair and startling. She did not decorate her eyebrows and eyelashes,
which were darker than her hair. And she wore high corsets, because her bosom, although firm,
was inclined to be over-flowing. The bodice of her dress fitted closely and emphasised what
was still a very shapely figure. She was what would be called a fine woman. Her eyes were full
and clear; her lips were well-moulded; her teeth, rather protruding, were unimpaired. Sally
was filled with renewed envy of her personal advantages. Then her eyes went back to Mrs. Perce's
hair. It was too obviously doctored. She didn't want anything like that. She wanted something
more delicate....

The truth flashed upon her. Mrs. Perce was a trifle on the coarse side. Sally quickly compared
Mrs. Perce's plump hands with her own lean ones. At the scrutiny, she put her hands below the
table, for they were not clean. But if they had been clean she would have taken pride in them;
for where the fingers of Mrs. Perce were stubby her own were slim and pretty. She understood
her own shortcomings, but in the quick observations and comparisons she had been making, Sally
had learnt a great deal more clearly than ever before how careful she must be to avoid exaggeration
in all she did. Dressed and adorned as Mrs. Perce was dressed and adorned, she would have looked
a guy. It was a new lesson to her, and a valuable one.

"Have you noticed," said Mrs. Perce, "how me and Perce's dressed up to-day?"

Sally was staggered. She looked quickly at old Perce and saw that he was in his best clothes,
with a lovely new spotted blue and white tie, and a dahlia in his buttonhole.

"Of course," she said. "I noticed everything. Didn't like to ask. What is it? Is it your birthday?
Wish I'd known," she added, half-truthfully. "I'd a brought you a present."

"No," laughed Mrs. Perce. "Very good guess. Not a birthday. It's the anniversary of our wedding-day.
Been married nine years, we have."

"Nine years!" echoed Sally, awestruck. "Nine years! And you haven't had a baby yet!"

There was a startling guffaw. Old Perce slapped his leg and bayed. Mrs. Perce threw herself
back in her chair, showing every brilliant tooth. The noise was tremendous.

"The things she says!" shrieked Mrs. Perce. "Perce, I always said that child was a caution!"
They both laughed until they were in an extremity of mirth.

Sally recognised herself as a wit, flushed, and laughed as heartily as they. She had spoken
incautiously, as a child, and without sophistication. But she accepted responsibility for her
joke. She was not in the least flurried, but was pleased at being considered an adept in the
ways of marriage. At heart she was despising herself for not having been more truly observant
of their clothes, because in reality she had been so concentrated upon Mrs. Perce that she
had never thought to spare an eye for Mrs. Perce's husband. She was thankful to have ridden
off so easily upon her naïveté. Meanwhile, having laughed amply, the Barrows had resumed their tea.

"Nine years, eh!" said old Perce, reflectively. "Takes some believing, Poll. Nine years. Nine
years, and no baby, eh!" He shook his head, like a cat sneezing, and laughed again. "Here,
Sally. Have some more kipper. More tea, then. Poll, here's a lady will have some more tea,
if you please, ma'am. Sweet enough, Sally? As before, if you please, Poll."

"See, where was you then, Perce?" asked Mrs. Perce. "Nine years ago."

"This time nine years ago----" murmured old Perce, reflectively. "I was at Potter's. Yes, Sally,
I waddn't makin' above two pound a week when I got married--if that. Two pound a week was about
my top-notch in those days. Well, it's different now." He shrugged his shoulders. "And I'll
tell you for why, Sally. It was Poll, there. Don't you forget it. If a man's got a good wife--say
there's something in him--he'll end his days in comfort. She'll see to that. Now, the man you
marry----"

"Here, Perce! Steady on!" cried Mrs. Perce. "Sally's not seventeen yet, remember."

"Wait!" Old Perce directed a finger. Sally was brimming with gladness, at the topic and the
confidence in herself which she saw he was going to express. "The man you marry, Sally--he'll
have to be a man. Understan' what I mean? None of these fine la-di-da fellows, but a Man. And--if
he works, you save. Not to scrape, you understand. Just save. For the first five years, be
careful. Have your fun. No harm in that. But be careful. No kids. No swank. Stability, that's
what's wanted. Stability. If you've got a bit of money behind you---- See what I mean?"

"Oo yes, Mr. Barrow," said Sally, incoherent with pride. "That's just what I think."

Old Perce looked at Mrs. Perce, raising his shoulders as if to exhibit Sally to her. There
was a nod between them. For some time all became rather thoughtful, perhaps thinking--as she
was uncontrollably doing--of Sally's future. Old Perce took out his pipe at last.

"I'm just going to step in the other room, Sally," he remarked, "and have a pipe and a bit
of a tune. I'll see you later--you ladies," he added gallantly, with a bow. And then he withdrew,
leaving them alone, with Sally's cheeks flushed at the warmth and the subject they had been
considering. All the time old Perce had been talking she had been wishing that Toby had been
there to hear. Then he'd have seen what these people thought of her. They didn't think of her
face; they didn't go off in a huff because she had been too ill to go out one evening. They
knew.... Tears filled her eyes. She stared at the red fire in the grate. Mrs. Perce had her
back turned, filling the kettle for the inevitable washing-up, and so she did not see this
sudden arrival of tragic reflection. All she saw was a willing Sally gathering the dishes and
scraping the fishbones together ready for throwing behind the fire. How was Mrs. Perce to visualise
that other tea, that lonely figure in the other room? How was anybody to understand why Sally
was so different from what she had been at home?

Over the washing-up, the two became confidential. Sally broached the subject of the West End.
She dilated upon it. Mrs. Perce was all sympathy, and full of agreement.

"You're quite right," she said. "And I'm glad. I wish I could help you. Now, can I?" She thought
a moment. "Wait a bit. Wait a bit."

She went out of the room. Amid the din of "There you are, there you are, there you ain't--ain't--ain't,"
Sally heard her call: "Perce, what's the name Maggie Merrick calls herself now?" There was
a silence. The door of the other room was closed. Sally, standing by the kitchen table, drying
a plate, strained her ears unavailingly. A silence was upon the flat. Only the fire huskily
caved in, and little darting sparks flew into the air. It was as though her life hung suspended.
Then, in a few minutes, Mrs. Perce returned, a triumphant beam upon her face. "You go and see
Maggie on Monday," she said. "I'll write her a letter. She calls herself Gala--Madame Gala.
Got a place round behind Regent Street, and about twenty hands. She's a very old friend of
mine.... I'll give you a letter to-night. Just say you come from Polly Barrow. She'll see you.
Course, I can't be sure...."

"No, no!" Sally's concurrence was eager. Her heart was like a flame. "You are kind to me, Mrs.
Perce."

"If I can help you, Sally...." Mrs. Perce's voice took on a tone of kindness almost solemn.
"Well, that's all right. Just wait till these things are washed."

Trembling, Sally introduced her other problem. At first Mrs. Perce gave a great laugh, and
looked very sharply at Sally. She looked at her dress, at her face, at her hair.

"I don't want to look...."

"It wouldn't help you to look made-up. Not with Maggie. So there is a boy!"

"No!" Sally's tone was fierce.

"Oh, all right." Mrs. Perce was evidently not altogether convinced. She dried her hands, her
head consideringly upon one side.

"Who'd look at me?" There was a vain effort in this speech to corroborate the disclaimer; but
there was also an ingenuous and pathetic appeal for some sort of reassurance, for this was
Sally's hidden fear.

"Don't be a fool, Sally. If a girl makes up her mind to have a man...."

Sally's heart leapt. She looked with shining eyes of glory at Mrs. Perce. It was the announcement
of her dream, a confirmation of her hope. She was for a moment ecstatic.

"Oh, Mrs. Perce!"

"You just look at him like that, my dear. Well, I'll tell you.... You don't want to look too
fresh. Don't use peroxide. Henna's the stuff for you."

"Henna! How much?" Sally was desperate. The word was open sesame to her.

"Wait a bit. I'll think. Henna. And a face cream. But mind, Sally, be careful. Not too much
of it. And whatever you do, remember your neck. You don't see it; but others do. All that's
above your dress. And a bit below. Some people are inquisitive. And just a bit of lip salve--just
a tinge. See, your lips aren't red enough. But you've got to be on the watch not to overdo
it. No good looking like a tart."

"No. It's just the hair and the freckles," breathed Sally.

"Oh, well.... We'll make a picture of you. And the eyebrows, Sally. But only a bit, Sally.
Only a bit. You've got to be moderate...."

Mrs. Perce went off into a delighted silence. She was in her element. She had before her a
great opportunity, and all her vanity was roused. They understood one another. And for all
Sally's disclaimer Mrs. Perce was in no way deceived about her ultimate object. She was as
aware of Toby as if she knew the facts. But she was too shrewd to force a confidence. To herself
she was laughing with the full enjoyment which some women, if not most of them, bring to the
contemplation of an intrigue and its ultimate consequences. Later, she resolved to add a word
of warning upon the handling of that subject. But more thought encouraged her to be silent.
There was that in Sally's bearing which gave Mrs. Perce to understand that in the long run
Sally knew what she was about. Mrs. Perce was conscious of a smart feeling of admiration for
this child.

xi

Clasping tightly the precious henna and her other purchases, Sally hurried home through the
dark streets. Within her blouse was the letter to Madame Gala. Her head was full of her plans,
her delighted anticipations of victory. For this moment she could not contemplate the possibility
that all would not go well. She was intoxicated. Her heart was swelling. Thoughts galloped
away, like steam from a boiling kettle. She kept no memory of them. It was enough for her that
she was thrilled with her own prospects. Of course Mrs. Perce's friend would take her on. Of
course Toby would fall in love with her. She could make him. Once let her achieve her immediate
objects, and there was no end to future possibilities. How strange, how wonderful, the difference
which the last few hours had made to her! It really seemed true for once that in the darkest
hour dawn was most nearly at hand. She let herself into the house and crept up the stairs,
subdued but exultant. It would now have taken much more than the coldness and darkness of the
horrible room to spoil her excited happiness. She even welcomed them, because if her mother
awoke there would be the less need for explanations. She stood a candle upon the washstand,
screened from the bed, and lighted the oil stove which they always used for preparing the breakfast.
Her purchases were carefully arrayed, and then hidden. She removed her outer clothes, and let
down her hair, shivering slightly, but tense with resolve and the absorption of the moment.
Round her shoulders she hung a big towel, and kicked it out, looking down at her legs and feet.
She was conscious of pride, of physical freedom. She made small dancing steps, as happy as
a child, while she waited and waited for the slow kettle to boil.

Later, Sally stole to bed, careful not to touch her sleeping mother, lest her own chill body
should awaken her and provoke a querulous scene. She was shuddering from head to foot. It seemed
to take hours to shake off the frozen feeling, and if she raised her feet and touched them
with her hands they were like pieces of ice. They were still cold when she forgot everything;
and she awoke, the towel still about her head, with the sun up and the day well advanced. A
careful hand to her hair, a quick scurry to the mirror, a leap of apprehensiveness; and then
she was back in bed, shamming sleep, because her mother had stirred. The two lay side by side
for ever so long, until Sally could once again allow herself to breathe freely. She did not
examine her feelings: she only knew that she was afraid and confident, alternately timid and
ashamed, and then again breathing deep with satisfaction. She had begun. She was set out upon
her adventure. At a blow she had to put everything to the test. How she longed for the next
day! How she longed for her interview with Mrs. Perce's friend, and for her next encounter
with Toby!

xii

At night she allowed her mother to go to bed first, and waited a little while before beginning
her preparations. She was so long that her mother, although still engrossed by the pain in
her head, began to grumble.

"What you doing, Sally?" she cried sharply.

"Washing my hair," answered Sally, like a shot.

"Ought to have done it in daylight, silly girl. And dried it in front the fire. I don't know
what's come to you, Sally. You seem to do everything you can to worrit me. Now I want to go
to sleep, and you keep the lamp burning, and the fire burning, and it's all alight, so I can't
get off."

Sally shaded the lamp. Her lip was curled. She did not deign to answer the complaint. Silly
old fool; always grumbling! Let her wait. Let her wait and see what happened! Sally was less
excited, and less clumsy, to-night. She was warmer, too; and that gave her more assurance.
Once her mother had fallen asleep, as she knew from the loud breathing, she became leisurely.
Her actions were even luxurious, so much more at ease was she. First of all she combed her
hair, wishing it were longer. Then she made all her dispositions. For the next hour she was
busy, and by the time she was in bed she had begun to giggle almost hysterically. She lay quite
still, and quite warm, listening for some sound of Toby. But none came. Wherever he was, she
did not hear him before she went to sleep.

And then in the dark morning her mother could not see the transformation that had occurred;
and Sally could not see it, either. They made a slow and tasteless breakfast, and Mrs. Minto
slipped out to her first situation, where she had to be at half-past seven. From that she would
go on to another at half-past ten that would keep her for the greater part of the afternoon.
Sally, instead of going back to bed, as she often did when the two breakfasted together, dressed
herself with great care and prepared to go out and meet May Pearcey. She tried to see herself
in the mirror, but could only get a lamplight view that frightened her. She had washed very
carefully, and as she had made her own dress it fitted well and suited her. She had a big black
hat and was going to get new gloves before calling upon Madame Gala. Her shoes were bad, but
she brushed them well. Stockings she had bought on Saturday night. Turning round and round
before the mirror, extending her arms, and patting down her skirt, she was content with everything
but the incalculable effect of her recent activities. But the part of her hair which showed
beneath her hat was a rich shade, and if her face looked artificially pale it still appeared
smooth and fresh.

What doubt she may have had was set at rest by May Pearcey when they met. The encounter took
place in Grove Road at the corner of Hornsey Road, just where the shops are; and the two girls
walked westward together.

"Oo, Sally, you do look smart!" May irrepressibly cried. "Oo, what you bin doing to your hair!
Looks lervly! Oo, and your face. Got off with a earl?"

She was all attention at Sally's tale, and Sally showed her the letter to Madame Gala. They
stood together reading it. For the moment May was honestly full of congratulation. She was
so simple-minded, and so little attached to the dressmaking, that she had no envy. A boy would
have been a different matter. And she was honestly delighted with Sally's appearance.

"You look lervly!" she kept saying. "Oo, I do hope you get it. I say, come out 's evening,
and tell me. Will you?" May was very coaxing indeed. She was sincerely impressed.

It was a compliment, as well as a curiosity. Sally hesitated. She had planned to see Toby;
but if Toby was going to be a lout she might just as well show him she didn't care.

"All right," she said. "Look here, if I'm not there by half-past seven, you'll know I've been
kept--mother's kept me. See?"

"Mother!" laughed May. "Well, I'll be there quarter-past. See! Shouldn't come any further,
case old Mother Jubb's lookin' out the window. She might not believe you was ill if she saw
you lookin' so smart. Might think you was takin' a day off to go to the Zoo."

They parted, May Pearcey to spin a tale of Sally's illness to Miss Jubb, and Sally to proceed,
after getting a pair of black cotton gloves, to the West End. In the shop, half hidden among
the rolls of flannel and little racks and trays of smaller articles of haberdashery, there
was a full-length strip of mirror. It stood gloomily in the half-light of the shop, which,
like all suburban drapers' shops, had the air of a crowded and airless cavern full of stale
adornments. Sally did not see the mirror at first, but while the shop girl went to fetch the
gloves, she was looking idly round when she caught sight of a slim young lady in black. The
young lady was very trim, dressed all in black, with slim ankles and pretty hands, and a big
black hat--and it was herself! Herself, looking like a lady. Quickly, she stepped to the mirror,
examining her cheeks, her neck, her brows, and her gloriously richly-tinted hair. She was amazed
and delighted. A proud smile twisted her thin little lips, so slightly touched with Lipsol
that they did not seem to have been touched at all, but only to be prettier than usual. After
the first curiosity, the first flush of recognition, followed precise scrutiny. Sally nodded
to herself. She would do. There was no doubt of it. From that moment she was no longer triumphant
or excited: she was sure. She had learnt a great lesson, that excitement is no criterion of
victory or happiness, and that the artist is cool, confident, free from triumph. At a bound,
Sally had become an artist. She had always been potentially an artist; but she at last had
attained vision.

xiii

Precious pennies went to pay her tram fare to Tottenham Court Road; and from there she walked
to Madame Gala's, asking the way, and getting rather flustered and bewildered at the pushing
crowds and the big shops with their irresistible windows, and the extraordinary amount of traffic
that seemed to make Oxford Street one continuous torrent of carts and omnibuses. The big furniture
shops in Tottenham Court Road had impressed her; but the shops in Oxford Street were beyond
anything she ever remembered to have seen. A flash of comparison with Holloway--even with Jones's
magnificent row of shops on the way to Highbury, or the big drapers and clothiers in the Upper
Street--made her realise how right had been her longing for the West End. It had been more
than a dream. It had been an inspiration. Holloway was seen in its dinginess, its greasy mud
on the rough roads, the general air it had of being a step or two behind the times; and here
was the brilliance, the enthralling reality, of the West to take its place. Sally was conscious
of new buoyancy. If she had been pleased with Tottenham Court Road, and delighted with the
essentially commonplace Oxford Street, she exulted in that alluring curve which will always
make Regent Street a fascination for the visitor to London and even a satisfaction to the Londoner
himself. Sally was both a Londoner and a visitor, and her feelings were proportionate. She
did not know that she was proud of being London born and bred; but her eye was possessive,
and she would not have given London in exchange for the dozen other great capitals of the world
put together. She looked round at the shops, at the buildings and the traffic; and she made
a historic remark.

"Cooh," she said. "Fine! Fancy living here! This is the place for me."

It was final. It took no account of the risks of a peradventure. Madame Gala was a mere cog
in the great wheel of Sally's progress through life. Even Toby had at first no place in her
survey. Then she wondered if he knew Regent Street. He could come one Saturday and wait for
her outside Madame Gala's. They would swank, and go and have tea at an A. B. C. or Lyons's;
and perhaps go into Hyde Park. Gradually it came back to her that her father used to take them
to Hyde Park on Sundays. But that was long ago, and on Sundays the traffic was less and the
shops were all shuttered. She gave a sigh at the memory, awoke, and marched up to a colossal
policeman who was wagging a pair of gloves in his right hand--as if to keep the flies away,
but in reality to encourage the traffic. He inclined an ear, and an eye to her letter, and
trumpeted out directions.

And at last Sally reached Madame Gala's, and with Madame Gala's another turning-point in her
life. It was the first time she had been conscious of so all-important an event. When she came
to the building she was trembling. Her eyes closed, almost in an expression of prayer. She
took five minutes to climb the stairs to the second floor, and then turned to fly. She recovered,
and hung about for a while, hoping for some accident to carry her right into the place. Then,
with a feeble air of confidence, she pushed open the door and walked in without knocking.

Sally could have fallen down in horror; for as she entered she saw a very tall young woman
talking to the most beautifully dressed person she had ever seen. And they were in a room such
as Sally had never been in before--a room entirely decorated in a sort of grey-blue. Wallpaper,
hangings, and chair-upholsterings were exactly uniform. The effect, although beautiful and
restful, was to Sally's eye so sumptuous that she felt she must by some terrible mischance
have come into a drawing-room. But she heard the young woman say, "Yes, meddam.... I'll tell
Madame Gala.... Yes, meddam.... Yes, meddam ... quite ... yes, I quite.... Good morning, meddam."
And then as the wonderful creature disappeared in a whirl of richness, like a fairy godmother,
the tall young woman turned almost pouncingly upon Sally, and in a contemptuous voice said "Yes?"

Sally shook herself. It was the gesture of one who has been dreaming.

"I want to see Madame Gala," she said, very distinctly. "I've got a letter for her from Mrs.
Barrow."

"Where is it?" demanded the young woman. "That it?"

She took from Sally's unwilling but unresisting hand the letter which Mrs. Perce had written,
pulled it from the open envelope, read it, and looked again at Sally.

"I want to see Madame Gala," said Sally, stubbornly. Her little mouth was now very savagely
set, and if there had been any refusal upon the young woman's part there would have been a scene.

"All right. Keep your hair on," said the inquisitive young woman. "Are you Miss Minto?"

"Yes, I am." Sally nodded energetically, flushing. She wondered if the word "hair"....

Her interlocutor turned, and went into an inner room, replacing the letter as she did so, and
folding over the flap, so that it would seem as though she knew nothing of the contents. Sally
quickly saw the kind of person she was--an interfering creature, with "Miss Pry" written all
over her. She was tall and thin, and had gooseberry eyes and a small nose and a large sycophantic
mouth. Sally had a picture of her all the time she was away--grey-blue dress and all. She didn't
like her. She hated her. She knew that they would never get on together. Miss Nosey! "Yes,
meddam; no, meddam ... yes, I quite...." Sally tried to pronounce quite "quaite," as she had
done. After all, she was only a sort of maid--somebody to take the names of callers. She'd
got no right to be saucy. Old six-foot. Old match-legs. She'd got a nose in everybody's business.
Mind she didn't get it pulled!... But what a lovely room! Must have cost pounds and pounds!
All grey-blue--even to the little ornaments on the mantelpiece, all except the black tiger.
Fancy working in a place like this! Different to Miss Jubb's! Sally gave a sort of internal
giggle, a noiseless affair that was almost just a wriggle of delight. Miss Jubb! Did you ever
see anything like the dress she made for Mrs. Miller, of 17 Tavistock! Chronic, it was! Like
a concertina! And poor old Annie Jubb getting flurried when the material frayed in the scissors!
Cooh! Call her a dressmaker! More like a figure of fun!

"Come in, please," said Nosey, jerking her nose. And Sally started once again from reverie,
to follow the tall young woman from the grey-blue room into another one which was all in a
warm colour between orange and biscuit. She swallowed quickly, and heard a little runnel of
moisture in her dry throat. There was a throbbing behind her eyes. She became very small and
clumsy, and kept her head lowered, and her hands clasped.

When a voice bade her sit down, Sally stole a quick glance at Madame Gala. At once she lowered
her eyes again, because they had met unexpectedly a pair of eyes more disconcerting than any
she had known since her schooldays. Madame Gala did not employ a score of hands for nothing!
She had looked at Sally the moment Sally came into the room, and did not cease to look at her.
And she had very cold grey eyes, and was very cold (really very deficient in stamina) herself.
She was terribly thin, and chilling, and capable. She was dressed in grey; but you could not
see the dress except at the bottom of the skirt and the middle of the sleeves, because she
wore a large pinafore-overall, of a lighter grey and a softer material. She had no pins in
her mouth, and there were no pictures of costumes or sheets of paper patterns to be seen. But
the room, all the same, was a workroom, and there was a beautiful large table in it which could
have served for cutting out a costume for a giantess.

"You're Miss Minto. How old are you? Hn, small for your age. Mother and father? When did your--oh,
you're in mourning for him. How did he die? What sort of accident? Hn.... What experience have
you had? Miss What? Oh, yes ... two years. Have you left? I see. Well, Mrs. Barrow's an old
friend of mine, and I'd like to oblige her. Also, I want more help. My business is increasing.
If you can start in a fortnight I'll pay you six--no, I'll pay you seven shillings a week.
You get here at nine in the morning. You'll do as you're told, and behave yourself. You'll
work under a very clever lady, Miss Summers, in that room. I'll show you. Come in here...."

Sally, shaking with jubilation, followed her into a very large room adjoining, where a number
of girls were (apparently) frantically busy--far too busy to be conscious that their employer
had entered the room. Sally did not believe that they were always so intent upon their work.
She knew too much. To herself she said "Swank!" It was a beautifully light place, all decorated
in a pale grey; and there was a long deep bench all round the room. It was lighted by windows
and a skylight, and it was plain that a considerable amount of work was in progress. Sally
gave a dazed glance round, and looked again, saying, "Yes, ma'am; Yes, ma'am," to everything
Madame Gala said; and a few minutes later was out in the street again, engaged at seven shillings
a week, and not knowing whether she was alive or dead, awake or dreaming. The day was still
before her; she had nearly ten shillings hidden in her bodice; and she was a queen amid all
the surging traffic of the West End--her West End--the place of her dreams, her pilgrimage,
her triumph. Sally's eyes were filmed with tears. She walked away from the building passionately
fighting with sobs that rose from deep within her. The tears trickled down her white cheeks.
And all at once she was laughing again, chuckling and chuckling as if this was the most splendid
joke in the world. And then, when the laughter was done, she was once again Sally, deliberate,
cool and unflinching. This was what she had determined. There were other steps to follow. She
must not be too sure; she must go carefully. But all the same she would win. She was Sally.
She was going to get on. She was going to be cautious. She was going to be secure. That was
her touchstone--security. Without it, she would never know peace. At all costs, security. That
meant keeping cool. That meant watching your step. And in the end it meant making money, and
having enough to eat, and nice clothes, and pleasures, and all that she had never yet had.
Into the eyes that had been brimming with tears, and, immediately after, with glee, there came
once again a hardness, a determination. It was the expression of a wary animal, treading among
dangers.

xiv

By an instinct, Sally turned west, so that she presently found herself in a confusing number
of small streets; but when she had extricated herself and had mastered the geography of that
part of London she was rewarded by coming out into Park Lane, with the fine breadth of Hyde
Park open to her eyes and her impulse towards exploration. She pretended that she knew the
Park; but in fact to her older eyes and in its weekday freedom from crowds it looked so different
that she could not link it with ancient memories. Thus, for a time, its paths and its greenness
and its air of great space gave her unqualified pleasure. She wandered on, observing the fallen
leaves, and the few pedestrians; and looked up at the blue sky, and marvelled to herself; and
then presently she sat down upon one of the public seats and tried to get some coherence into
her thoughts. She sat there for some time, her shabby little toes cocked up on the gravel before
her, and she began to feel lonely and tired and restless, as though something further had still
to be done. There was the whole day before her. She could not stay here, because although the
day was clear and fine there was a chill wind, and she was not warmly clad. Already her hands
were feeling numb in the cotton gloves, and her feet were losing the pleasant tired tingle
they had had a short time before. The sense of innumerable hours which had to be filled was
strong upon Sally, who had never previously had so much time to herself, alone. So she rose
briskly from her seat, walked along the broad pathway, and came back to the Marble Arch, where
Oxford Street began again. This time she was bent upon looking at the shops, and browsed for
a time at the windows of Lewis's, at the end of Orchard Street. And then she had her inspiration.
A clock told her it was after half-past eleven. May's words came into her mind: "She might
think you was takin' a day off to go to the Zoo."

"Here, where's the Zoo," she suddenly, without a tremor, asked a policeman.

"They got plenty white mice," the policeman said. "No good you a-goin' there."

"Saucy!" rebuked Sally. "Suppose they let you out ... on a chain."

"Quite right," said the policeman. "Didn't want to let me go. Everybody loved little Sammy.
But the Police Force wanted me."

"Fancy wanting you!" remarked Sally, witheringly, staring at his good-tempered face, and, under
his helmet, at a pair of bright blue eyes. He was a "red" man. "Give 'em a bit of ginger, I
suppose."

"As you go by the Marrabon Road, you just cross over and go into Madame Tussaud's. You'll see
a lot of old friends and relations there. Charlie Peace, and Mother Dyer...."

"Who's she?" Sally demanded. "Mother Dyer. Never heard of her."

"Mother Dyer? Baby-farmer. Her you used to call 'Nursie.' Go straight along here, and when
you've looked at Madame Tussaud's, keep down the Marrabon Road till you come to the Park. See?
Regent's Park, that is. And walk along the nice broad road, and you'll find the Zoo on your
left. Good morning, my dear.... Don't let 'em keep you, will you?... Cahm alahng, 'ere; cahm
alahng, 'ere." He broke off to attend to the traffic, which he addressed in a very different
way from that in which he had spoken to Sally; and she, rather cheered by the exchange of badinage,
set off towards Baker Street and the Marylebone Road with a new interest in hand. Madame Tussaud's
and the Zoo in one day! What a day it would have been by the time she reached the end of it.
What a tale she would be able to tell May in the evening!

Apart from the two visits which she made, to the wax-works and the menagerie, both of which
took so long that she did not get home until six o'clock, Sally had no other adventure. She
had lunch in the Zoo, and arrived back in Holloway with less than five shillings remaining
from her windfall. But it had been a day, and it still held marvellous possibilities of an
encounter with Toby. Her first thought on reaching home was of him. That was why she was so
deaf to her mother's complaining. She did not hear it. And she did not tell her mother of the
day's outing. There would be time for that later. If she told her now there would only be trouble,
and Sally was tired of trouble. When she had explained to Miss Jubb, and had left Miss Jubb
on Saturday week, she would airily say to her mother: "I got a job in the West End, now." See
ma jump! Sally was conscious for the first time of a slightly sinking heart. Suppose she didn't
suit Madame Gala? Suppose she lost her new job after a week or two? Oh, rubbish.... Rot! Time
enough for the gripes when she got the sack!

She could hear no sound at all from the room above. Was Toby not home yet? He used to get home
about ten minutes past six, as a rule. It was now a quarter-past. If she did not hear him she
would go and meet May, and then call in to tell Mrs. Perce all about the news, and then come
home after her mother had gone to bed. She had her tea, turning up her nose at it, and all
the time wishing for something better. For some time after the meal she stood about reflecting
upon her day and upon the possibilities of the future. Consideringly, she at last said in a
matter-of-fact tone:

"One day we'll have jam for tea, ma. And kippers. And fried sausages. And steak and chips."

"Good gracious!" cried Mrs. Minto. "Whatever's put such ideas into your head!"

"And we'll have real coal, and thick blankets, and a new mattress, and new curtains, and a
brass fender. And everything in the room'll be a beautiful gray-blue. And you'll sit here,
doing nothing."

"I'm sure I shan't," exclaimed Mrs. Minto, fingering her mouth to hide a nervous smile of pleasure.

"Doing nothing. And Elbert, the footman, will come in with the tea and take it away again;
and you'll say, Elbert'--mustn't say 'Elbert dear'--you'll say, 'Elbert, just bring me my glass
of hot water at ten o'clock.' And he'll say, 'Yes, me lady.' No, he won't. He'll say, 'Yes,
meddam ... quite.... Yes, meddam.' That's what he'll say. Lick your shoes, he will, because
you're rich."

"Rich!" sighed Mrs. Minto. "Who's to make me rich?"

"I'm going to make us all rich," explained Sally. "You mark my words and wait and see."

"I wouldn't mind not being rich," Mrs. Minto said, "if it wasn't that my poor 'ed...."

"O-oh!" cried Sally, in wrath. Her mood was crushed by this inexorable return to the subject
she had been chattering to avert. "Give your old head a rest, ma. Here, come out for a walk
with me."

"You're not to go out, Sally. Mrs. Roberson says...."

"That for Mrs. Roberson," said Sally, already on her feet. "You don't suppose I'm going to
stick in here and get frozen stiff. There's nothing to do indoors. I got no sewing. Only makes
me fret if I stay at home. I'm going to see Mrs. Perce...."

She moved hastily to the door, and closed it quietly after her, for she had heard below her
the shutting of the front door, and she thought it might be Toby at last. It was nearly a quarter
to seven. Her guess had been right. It was he. Seeming not to have heard him, she ran lightly
down the stairs as he heavily mounted them. Her heart was thumping so that she felt quite sick
and faint. She could no longer run, but could only totter down towards the inevitable confrontation.
It was there, and it was past--a plain, boorish "Evening." She managed the rest of the flight
at a run; but when she was out of doors Sally turned to the darkness and could no longer restrain
her tears of anguish. This was the end of her day. Laugh in the morning, cry before night.
That was the truest proverb that ever was made. She was heartbroken.

xv

There was no question of seeing May or calling upon Mrs. Perce. Sally was beaten. She was full
of expostulations and arguments, but all were addressed to Toby, and she could not have borne
any other society. So she wandered about the streets for an hour, miserably aware that once
or twice she was followed by an aimless strolling youth who did not know how to occupy a lonely
evening and who yet was too much of a coward to address her. In her mind she went over every
detail of her friendship with Toby. It had become suddenly unreal, like a thing that had happened
years before. And yet the throb of pain belonging to her sense of his cruelty was immediate.
Every detail was clear to her; and the whole was blurred. He was a stranger; and yet his presence
would at once have given life to her memories. They had been written, as it were, in invisible
ink, which needed only the warmth of a fire to produce their message vividly once again. Sally
sobbed from time to time; but she was no longer crying. Her pain was too deep to be relieved
by tears, which with her were the result of weakness, since she was not naturally liquid. And
as the memory was exhausted in its evocation she began to think as of old. Her quick brain
was recovering its sway. She was no longer an overwrought child. And yet when she strove to
plan a discomfiture for Toby, who had so wickedly hurt her, she shrank from that also; so it
was still a restless and undetermined Sally who returned home to find her mother dozing by
the feeble warmth of a dying fire.

The next day passed in a variety of moods, and in the evening Sally found in herself the determination
to call upon Mrs. Perce. She had explained her non-arrival of the previous night to May, and
had removed her grievance with a recital of all she had done during the stolen day. She had
endured Miss Jubb's sour scrutiny of her hair, which was accomplished without comment. And
she had almost, but not quite, told Miss Jubb of her proposed change. At times her courage
was very nearly high enough, but it never reached the necessary point, or the opportunity was
ruined at the vital moment by some interruption. So Miss Jubb worked innocently, not guessing
the blow that was to fall. That it would be a serious blow only Sally suspected. Miss Jubb
had never even supposed it possible that Sally would leave her. The three of them spent the
day in the little workroom, which managed by the end of the afternoon to be the coldest and
the closest room in the neighbourhood, perhaps owing to Miss Jubb's use of a defective stove
for heating, and her own radical immunity from chilblains.

After tea Sally went straight to Hornsey Road. In thinking of Toby as she left the house she
made a light gesture with her fingers to show that he no longer existed. If she had met him
she would have attempted no greeting, for such was her present temper. At the Barrows' she
was received with acclamation. Old Perce, who had enjoyed a good deal of four-ale during the
day, and had a jugful of it now at his elbow, collapsed at sight of her. He bayed a little,
but with an expression of admiring wonder that gave Sally her best tribute. Mrs. Perce, the
expert, nodded. She had received a letter in the morning from Madame Gala. So to her all the
news was known. All the same, Sally spent a happy couple of hours in the flat, and collected
her outdoor clothes with unwillingness. Each time she had been to see Mrs. Perce she had felt
more strongly than of old the contrast between her always-cheerless home and their warm, prosperity-laden
atmosphere. The recognition acted powerfully upon her. It was the creation in her mind of a
standard of physical comfort, as the visit to Madame Gala had created a standard of decorative
colour. She was frowning at the new perception as she left the house, and was half-absorbed
in her consciousness of it.

The feeling did not prevent her, at first with a sharp tingling of surprise, and then, as she
grasped the significance of the fact, a start of emotional disorder, from seeing a familiar
figure in the light of the Supply Stores. Her heart jumped, and began to flurry in her breast.
The figure she saw was that of Toby. He stood a little to the side of the Stores, watching
the doorway from which Sally came. As she flinched, he came across the road. Sally pretended
not to notice him, and knew that he was following her. But Toby made no attempt to speak to
her while they were in the light of the shops. She saw that he had his cap pulled very low
down over his eyes, and that his hands were not in his pockets, but hanging loose. He was dressed
in a rough dark tweed suit, and looked like a fighter, but not a professional boxer. His carriage
was clumsy, but light. His dark face was marked by a sort of determination--not bravado, not
impudence, but a solid resoluteness. His eyes she had never properly seen. His mouth was large,
but the lips were thin; the nose was coarse, but not big. He was ugly, but he was very obviously
strong. He was not tall, but was very sturdily built, and gave the air of considerable strength.
As he followed her she could hardly keep from looking back; it was only with a great effort
that she kept her eyes forward, and as she turned into Grove Road she increased her pace. Sally
knew quite well what he would do. He would wait until she had passed the block of shops and
had come to the comparative darkness of the houses beyond. Then he would walk abreast and speak
to her. And while she tried to think what to do her heart was strangling her. She was so excited
that her breath was coming almost in sobs. She was excited, but she did not therefore feel
at his mercy.

It happened as Sally had foreseen. As soon as she was past the shops she heard his urgent voice
at her elbow--"Sally!" For a moment she ignored it. Then she turned, very coldly, and with
a slight sneer looked at him. They were side by side now. He was keeping step with her as easily
as he could have kept step with a child. "Sally," he repeated. Sally stopped dead.

"What are you following me for?" she asked, viciously. "Why can't you leave me alone? Following
me like that! I never heard of such a thing."

"I been waiting outside for you all the time. I've had no grub. I followed you from the house.
I saw you start out just as I was getting home."

"Well, what of it? I didn't ask you to follow me, did I?" demanded Sally. But in the darkness
of the street her eyes softened. Her heart swelled at the thought that he had waited for her
in the Hornsey Road for fully two hours. Toby took her defiance as a matter of course. He was
still standing doggedly before her, and as she began once again to walk rapidly in the direction
of home he followed her, half a step behind. At the darkest part of the road he put out a hand
to check her progress. Sally snatched away her arm, but he had been prepared for that, and
caught her immediately. He held her, panting, as she pressed against a big stone gate-post.

"Let me be!" cried Sally, hoarsely and breathlessly. "Let me be." She did not scream. She was
too impressed by his exhibition of strength. He continued to hold her, and they stood breast
to breast, Sally panting, and Toby with a kind of stolid determination.

"Will you come for a walk quietly?" he asked, jerking his head.

"No," said Sally, "I won't." There was no mercy, no humility. Only a hard defiance.

"Yes, you will." He pulled her towards him, so that Sally could not escape. She was now wholly
within the circle of his arm, not struggling, but with her poor thin arms staving him off.
Her body was tense. But she made no sound, and if there were any passers they knew that this
was only a typical lovers' tiff, common to the neighbourhood, and largely a matter of physical
strength and feminine vituperation. "Yes, you will. See? Come on, Sally."

"You let me go," she demanded.

"Say you'll come. I'll let you go the moment you say that."

Sally hesitated, then bowed her head in a slow acquiescence. He released her, and she ran;
but he easily overtook her, and she was once again held, still with her back to a pillar. Both
were now breathing hard. Sally's head was lowered. She was suffocating. She seemed to be in
complete darkness. And she had no sense of what was happening. The mere technique of the row
absorbed her. They were almost like two quarrelling cats, both sullen, both glowering and full
of resentment rather than burning anger.

"Will you come?" asked Toby. "Just for a walk. Half an hour."

"What d'you want me to come for?"

"Want to talk to you."

"Yes, well, I don't want to talk to you. Understand?" Sally was suddenly trembling with a passionate
rage. Her voice quivered as she spoke, and the words tumbled out in a savage incoherence.

"I'm going to talk to you. So you may as well make up your mind to come. You don't want to
stand here all night, do you?" He was as savage as she, and more grim. Sally made an attempt
to escape, and was further pinned. He was breaking down the defence of her tired arms. One
of his knees was against her leg. She was slipping, slipping, and her resolve to fight against
him was fading as rapidly in her sense of the physical contact. She burst into tears. For an
instant he loosed her, at that, but as she sobbingly began to run away he resumed his former
hold, pressing her against him, a broken little girl, and no longer the triumphant Sally of
the morning. Her hand was to her eyes, and she was biting her lip to restrain her sobs. Toby
put his free hand up and touched hers, held it, drew it away from her wet face.

"Sally," he said. "I want you. Don't cry, Sally."

His arm tightened. His face was close. Although she turned away her head, and tried to wrench
herself free, Sally knew his lips were relentlessly following her own. She was conscious of
all the joy of surrender, incapable of moving from those strong arms, incapable of avoiding
his kiss. Her eyes closed, her heart rose; she was limp in his embrace, not as yet returning
his caresses, but accepting them with a feeling of miserable thankfulness. Her hat was tilted
back, and she felt his cheek against hers, his body against her own. How long they stood she
did not know; but at last she put her hands up, put them round his neck, and feverishly kissed
him, welcoming this joy that was half pain.

"D'you love me?" she asked breathlessly.

They were alone in the dark street, in the invisible world; and she had never been so happy.
So at last Toby had his way, and they walked about the streets for an hour, until it was long
past the time when Sally should have been in bed. Only then did they part, and Sally was half-undressed
when she heard Toby passing upon his way upstairs. Her cheeks were burning, her eyes shining,
her heart exultant. Sometimes, as she lay wakeful during the long night, she was so happy that
she could hardly breathe. But a moment came when happiness seemed overwhelmed in a poignance
of emotion that resembled rather a terrible apprehensiveness, and it was then that Sally felt
the tears trickling from her eyes. It was only the reaction from excessive joy; but she was
deeply affected. She longed again for Toby's arms to be round her, pressing her face into the
pillow to comfort herself with the pretence that he was still there. Exhausted, she slept.

xvi

All the next day she could not work for preoccupation with her happiness. She was mad with
it, and reckless in her madness. It even, when rebuke came from Miss Jubb, gave her courage
to mention Madame Gala. And that was a further cause for delight, since Miss Jubb's mouth dropped
open at the news and she could hardly speak to her two girls for the rest of the afternoon.
Sally, chuckling to herself, and every now and then grimacing at May Pearcey, abandoned herself
to anticipations of the evening. She would see her dear Toby, would show how much she loved
him, would feel herself loved, would hear and say all the little secrets they had never spoken
until now. She would know at last what it was to be in love, and with the man who loved her.
How wonderful it was! What joy! What fun! Sally could not conceal her grin of happiness. Her
white face was as if it had become plump, so immediately did happiness transfigure her. And
she looked at silly old Miss Jubb, and soppy May, and thought how they had no lovers. May had
her boys--she could keep them. Sally had Toby. Toby was not a boy: he was a man. He shaved;
she had felt the roughness of his chin. May's boys looked as if they had smooth faces, or if
they shaved it made their skins powdery. Miss Jubb had never had a boy at all, she shouldn't
think. You couldn't fancy Miss Jubb as a young girl. She must be quite old--as old as Sally's
mother--perhaps forty. But ma had been unlucky to strike dad. He had never been any good. Not
like Toby. Toby was getting almost a pound a week already, he said; and when he was older he
would have lots of money, and never be out of a job, because he worked with his hands, with
engines, and a man who understood engines would never want for work. He was twenty, and he
kept himself. He just took his meals with his aunt, and lived in his own room the rest of the
time. How she would like to see his room. She longed for them both to get older. But she wanted
to get on herself, first. She thought: if Toby's out all day, and we just have a little home,
I shall be able.... She thought she might be a dressmaker herself, and employ twenty hands,
and have a waiting-room that was all grey-blue. She had told Toby about Madame Gala, and how
he could come to fetch her Saturdays, and they'd have the afternoons together. Sally was brimming
with plans.

In the middle of them there came a knock at Miss Jubb's door. Miss Jubb went, thinking it might
be a customer. But she came back again in a minute, with a face even longer than it had been
since she heard Sally's news. She could hardly speak, but stood against the dingy door, which
she held closed, and swallowed quickly before she could say a word.

"Sally dear, there's a man here from the hospital. Get on your hat and coat, there's a good
girl. He says your mother's been taken there. She turned dizzy just now when she was crossing
the road, and was knocked down by a van, and run over. She's asking for you, Sally. You're
to go. It's not serious, he says. So don't worry about it. You're just to go and see her."

Mother? Ma knocked down by a van! Sally was on her feet in an instant. As Miss Jubb went out
again to glean further details from the man, Sally struggled into her hat and coat. She turned
with a callousness which showed that she did not in the least realise what might have happened,
and addressed the startled and gaping May.

"We may not be princesses," she said with a sort of wild gaiety; "but we do see life!"

xvii

After she had seen her mother in the hospital Sally was again aware of that sinking feeling
of having time to fill--a feeling of emptiness of immediate plan,--which she had felt in Hyde
Park on the Monday. At seven she was to see Toby outside the house. It was not yet five. What
was she to do? Not go back to Miss Jubb's, that was certain! Her mother had been lying in a
cot in a big ward, and her arm was bandaged, and she said both her legs felt as though they
had red-hot nails in them; but she was conscious, and they had told her she would soon be about
again. Sally was to see Mrs. Roberson and tell her the news, and to go to two other places
to let them know that Mrs. Minto would not be able to come for a time. And she was to be a
good girl, and not worry, but to take the three shillings and ninepence which was in Mrs. Minto's
purse, and look after herself, and explain to the landlady what had happened.... She had a
host of things to do, and she paid her three calls within ten minutes. So far the question
of money had not troubled her. She did not think that three shillings and ninepence was very
little to live on for perhaps a month. Her emotions at the moment were so blithe that all she
perceived in herself was a sense of liberty. Ma would not be worrying her every minute she
was indoors to do this or that, and not to do the other. Ma would not be talking all the time
about her head. Ma would not be watching her, asking what she was doing, playing the policeman,
grumble, grumble, grumble. It was a fine liberation for Sally. That was the way in which she
saw it.

Her first shock was when she arrived home and found her own breakfast dishes still strewn about
the table as she had left them, the fire unlighted and the old ashes still lying in the grate
and upon the hearth, the bed unmade. She was sobered. She first of all found the oil, filled
the lamp, and set a match to it. Then she swept the hearth and carefully made a small fire.
The coal-blocks took a long time to catch, as they always did, and they quickly burned dull.
Upon them she set a kettle, washed the dishes in cold water, and laid the table for tea. The
kettle took a century to boil, and she knelt close to the fire, warming herself and waiting
for the first spiral of steam. Everything now made her feel splendid. She invented a game that
she was married to Toby, and that she was expecting him home; so that for this evening all
her work was thoroughly done. Even the bed was made with care. And when she had finished tea
she cleared away, and spread a little old red cloth upon the table, and once more snuggled
close to the puny fire. As she did so all her thoughts were for Toby. Already she began to
listen for him, although it was long before his time. Thought of her mother's accident did
not disturb her at all. Thought of the future was abandoned. Only the sweet delight of being
with Toby again was her incessant reverie.

At last she heard him, and started to her feet. Her impulse was to run to the door and whisper
to him at once; but on the way thither she checked herself. Some scruple of prudence, lest
he should think her too eager for him, made Sally allow the steps to pass on up the stairs.
But for all that she watched the clock, and listened almost passionately for any sound from
above. The fire died. She put on her coat and hat, standing near the fireplace to catch the
last waves of heat, with her foot upon the fender and her eyes fixed upon the purplish glow,
so rapidly fading to mauve and to grey. She was tense with expectancy. She had no consciousness
of anything but her strained hearing. Tick-tick-tick. The clock raced on, but the hands all
the time appeared to remain still, by so much did her eager heart outstrip them.

Then there was a thud upstairs, as of a door closed; and quick steps sounded in Toby's room.
He stayed there a few minutes, his feet moving a little, and Sally guessed that he was washing
himself. Then, noisily, he came down the stairs and left the house. He was barely past the
door when Sally blew out the lamp; but she stood mutely in the darkness for more than a minute
afterwards. Only when her own patience was gone did she obey her impulse and follow him, creeping
down the stairs in the subdued brown light of the house. Out of doors all was black. She peered
for Toby. He was there just under the lamp at a few yards distance, and she saw him move farther
away at her approach. That action, and the sense of him, gave Sally the most extraordinary
tremor of excitement and happiness, and her cheeks grew warm. She greeted him with the lightest
touch of the arm, and felt in return his hand to her elbow. They walked without speech to the
end of the road, and by common impulse to a dark turning where at this time of the evening
they knew there would be no passers; and there Toby caught her in his arms. There was no moon,
and no sound in the street. They were entirely alone, and separated from the rest of mankind
by an impassable wall of obsession. They stood pressed close to one another, kissing from time
to time, and did not speak. They had at first nothing to say, but there was no shyness between
them. They were absorbed in this physical contact. But after some time Sally told him her news,
and made him tell her what he had done during the day, and felt a great proprietary interest
in him all the while. They spoke in low tones, lovers and amorous lovers even in the middle
of humdrum confidences. Toby was shocked about Mrs. Minto--far more shocked than Sally had
been or could have been; but she airily reassured him in her first delicious abandonment to
a sense of common life. She said "Oo, she's all right. Quite comfortable. More than if she
was at home. And it's nicer for me, being alone. See, she grumbles at me--always at it--what
Mrs. Roberson says, and about her head, and what I ought to do, and that. 'Tisn't that there's
really anything to grumble at; only, you know, it's her nature. I never grumble. That's one
thing about me. Doesn't matter what happens, I never ... you know ... keep on at it, like mother
does. What's the good? Crying won't do any good, or grumbling either. I shall be happier while
she's away--do what I like. Be on my own."

"Won't you be lonely?" Toby asked.

"Not with you. Different if I hadn't got you. But if I get frightened I shall just yell for
you; and I shall think of you all the time, upstairs, and wonder if you're thinking of me.
Will you be?"

"Course I shall," Toby swore, hugging her until she gasped. "All the time."

"Will you? It's nice to have somebody to ... you know, like you."

"Is it?" he asked gruffly.

"Don't you feel like that?" she asked artfully. Her reward, another choking hug, was immediately
forthcoming. "You are strong," Sally went on, and with a sense of daring and ownership and
pride felt his arm for muscle. "I'm strong. In a way. Not massive, or anything of that kind.
I can stand a lot. Mustn't think I'm weak because I'm small; but.... Well, you know what I mean."

"Strong, but got no strength," suggested Toby. Sally shook him, chuckling proudly at his wit
and will to tease. It was like shaking a tree, so immovable was he by the exerted strength
of her weak arms.

"Saucy!" she said. "Though I s'pose it's what I meant. Toby, you do like ... you know ... this?"
she suddenly asked, not bent upon a caress, but in a sudden doubt. Her arms were warmly about
his neck as she spoke. Toby left her no doubt. He was not talkative; he had no ready flow of
compliment; but he could speak the language which a young girl in love best understands. He
could crush her almost to ecstatic forgetfulness in his vigorous arms. Thus embraced, Sally
was in Paradise, and her one desire was to remain there, in a sort of annulment of every other
interest; but even in Paradise she found her thoughts irrepressible. So she chattered on, while
Toby grunted or did not say anything, or occasionally grew marvellously glib and told something
about his work, or an anecdote about himself which she sometimes thought he must have read
somewhere. And ever and anon they were lost in silence, and their closeness to one another,
and their long breathless kisses, which made Sally lean her forehead against Toby's breast
and enjoy exquisitely the sense of being weaker than he and of surrendering all her will to his.

If it had not been so cold they might have stood in this way for the whole evening; but the
wind was searching, and presently they began to walk along, he with his arm about her so closely
that they walked almost with one motion. Toby smoked his cigarettes, and when he wanted one
he put his left hand in his pocket, and drew out a cigarette, and Sally felt for his matches,
and struck one, and held it for him, and received smoke in her face, and blew the match out,
and received a kiss, Toby all the time never ceasing to hold her within his right arm. She
wished there were more cigarettes, so much did she enjoy the sense of intimacy. Sometimes she
could not resist the temptation to put her arm round Toby's waist, and give him a little private
hug of her own, to show how happy she was. She loved the darkness more and more, because it
made her bolder. And the sky was so dark that the lamps were like small nickers, and if anybody
passed it was impossible for a face to be seen. And Sally was alone in this dream world with
Toby. She wished it might continue like this for ever, night and day, beautifully quiet and
secret, with Toby all the time loving her as much as he did now. It was lovely. It was lovely.
She was happy. She did not feel tired or cross or mean or worldly any longer; but only happy,
and full of love.

At last they heard a clock striking eleven, and Sally gave a jump.

"Mercy! Eleven o'clock. Must go home. Good job mother's not there. Else she'd be asking questions."
She laughed as she spoke. "She'd want to know something. I shouldn't half have a time. 'Eleven
o'clock: where you been?' I shouldn't mind. I'd take no notice. I don't take any notice of
her, because ... you know ... it encourages her if you take any notice. Oo, the way she keeps
on. You wouldn't believe. Drive me to drink, it would, if I had it all the time. But she's
not there...." Sally hugged Toby. "Isn't it lovely! Nobody to grumble. Nobody to mind what
time I get in.... Well, you know what I mean. I must go in now." But when it came to the moment
of parting she clung to him. "I don't want to go. I don't want to go," she cried. "It's been
so nice, and I've been so happy." To her horror she felt that she had begun to cry. With an
effort she pulled herself free. "Well, I suppose I must. And you'll think of me, won't you?
Just downstairs. And I'll think of you, and wish you were there.... Oh, fancy me saying that!
Toby...." She was passionately serious. "Say you love me!"

"Love you!" said Toby.

She turned and waved to him when she was a few steps away, flew back to his arms, and stayed
there for a few minutes. Then, this time with more resolution, she ran towards home, letting
herself in with a sense of brazen guilt at her lateness, and treading softly up the stairs.
When she was in the room, she shuddered a little, at the cold, and in her excitement. Then
she lighted the lamp and looked at herself in the mirror--at her bright, betraying eyes, at
her mouth, which was also betraying, and at her hair and cheeks and brows and hands. She was
laughing, but not aloud. Her laughter was the mirth of happy excitement. And, still so happy,
she began to undress; and then thought she would make herself a cup of tea. So she finished
undressing while the kettle boiled, and was sitting up in bed drinking her tea when she heard
Toby go upstairs. His movements made her start, and the tea dribbed over the side of the cup.
Into her head suddenly came a memory of her own words: "And I'll think of you, and wish you
were there."

"And so I do," she suddenly whispered. "So I do. Oh, I'm wicked. I'm wicked!" She was trembling,
and forgetting everything, her eyes fixed upon the wall vaguely grey before her, outside the
pale ray of the lamp. Mechanically, she sipped again, and the tea ran warmly into her throat.
"No, I'm not wicked," Sally argued. "I'm not. 'Tisn't wicked to love any one like I do Toby.
It's wonderful. Fancy me in love! And Toby ... well, liking me. Oo, he is strong and big. Wonder
if he's brave? I should think so. You couldn't be as strong as him and not be brave. Oh, I
love him." She remembered their caresses, unembarrassed and exulting. She knew what it was
to be loved. She knew ... she knew everything. Everything that made people love each other
and want to be always together. Her mind persistently went on kneading into a general memory
the detached memories of the evening, and she was excited and full of longing for Toby. Slowly
she drank her tea, without thinking of it at all, but accepting its comfort. Her shoulders
began to feel cold, and she shivered as she finished the cup.

Sally slid out of bed to replace the cup and to put out the lamp. As her hand was outstretched
she thought she heard a faint noise, but a moment's startled listening reassured her. It had
been nothing. She lowered the wick, and blew out the remaining small blue rim of light. Another
instant, and she would have been back in bed, snuggled down in the warmth. But at that instant
she heard a further sound, this time the turning of the door handle. She froze with sudden
dread. In the darkness she could see nothing.

"Who's there?" she whispered.

The door must slightly have opened. She could now see it open in the gloom.

"Sally."

It was Toby. Joy took the place of fear. He was inside the door, and she was in his arms, and
the door was closed again behind them.

"My dear," Sally was saying, in a thick little caressing voice. "My dear."

"Had to come," mumbled Toby, hoarsely. "Thought of you all alone. I wanted you. See, I had
to come."

"Of course you did," murmured Sally, her spirit leaping up and up in tempestuous excitement.
"Toby, you do love me? You do truly love me?"

She had no sense then of anything but her love for him and his love for her. She was carried
right past caution and thought. She was in his arms, and she was happy. And Toby, a dim figure
of burly strength, was kissing her until she was blinded and choking with excitement beyond
all she had ever felt. Everything conspired to affect her--all suppressions, all knowledges,
all curiosities and vanities. Nothing but caution could have restrained her, and caution was
forgotten. She was vehemently moved and beyond judgment or reflection. Her one desire was to
give herself to the man she loved, the man who loved her. And the opportunity was upon them
as they were in the first fever of their passion.

BOOK TWO: GAGA

i

Ten days later, Sally began her work with Madame Gala. She arrived punctually, but found Nosey
before her, keeping a record of arrivals. She also found one or two other girls, who stared
at her in an inquisitive fashion and went on talking among themselves. Only when a forewoman--Miss
Summers--arrived did the big room take on any air of being used for work, and within five minutes
all the girls were in a state of preparation. Sally saw that they all had sleeved pinafores
or overalls; she had none. As she had not a farthing to buy material to make such a thing,
and had only a couple of slices of bread and margarine in her coat pocket for lunch, and would
have to walk all the way home, Sally could not fight against the chilling of her heart which
quick glances about the workroom produced. The girls were of all sorts and sizes, some of them
smartly dressed and coiffed; others wearing clothes less expensive even than her own, and with
a general air of not knowing how to make the best of themselves. Looking round at the faces
she could see none that indicated cleverness or special intelligence. One ferrety-looking little
thing seemed as though she might be either sharp or half-witted; a tall dark girl who was rather
pretty and had beautiful hair used her hands with assurance; but observation did not make Sally
feel ashamed of herself or of her ability. These girls could do almost as they were told, but
not quite. But the pinafore was a serious question. Sally had never been used to such a thing.
She had not even brought an apron.

While the others settled down, whispering among themselves and looking sharply at Sally, the
forewoman, after a greeting, ignored her until she had attended to all that was more important.
In her hands was the giving out of work. Sally saw that she was supposed to know what each
girl could do. She also saw that some girls were favourites and others not. If she were to
make progress here she must be a favourite. She must show quickly that she had the brains and
could work well. It took a very short time to make her realise that. For a moment she was inclined
to be over-confident; but that mood collapsed before a side glance and a titter from two of
the girls. Their instinctive ridicule warned and stiffened Sally. They did not know her. She
would have to prove her qualities. She then concentrated upon Miss Summers, watching how she
turned, how she smiled and frowned, and how she explained what had to be done to each girl
who was receiving new work. Miss Summers was a short stout woman with cat's eyes and a long
nose. She licked her lips like a cat. She was inconsistent and short-tempered; but Sally afterwards
found that while she was extraordinarily vain she was rarely unkind. But in general she was
severe, because severity was the only course to pursue with these chattering girls, who were
full of scratches and jealousies, and who would have taken advantage of weakness with rapid
unscrupulousness. So the little stout woman, feline and easily exasperated, was a good person
to control the room. Her kindness might be part of her vanity, but it was not assumed. She
loved her work, and she was always glad to praise good work from the girls, and to encourage
it by favouritism to good workers. It was not the pretty ones or the sly ones who were the
favourites. It was the workers. Following each girl with her eye, Sally could not observe that
at the beginning; but it did not take her long to add it to her now formidable collection of facts.

When at last Sally was called to Miss Summers's side, and questioned, she walked the length
of the room feeling as though her legs had no joints, and as though her shoulders were fixed.
There were only eleven girls in the room besides herself, but they were all looking at her.
And when she stood before Miss Summers in her little black dress she looked so slight, with
her slim body and thin pale face, that several of the girls went on with their work again immediately,
having lost interest in her. Sally, confronted by Miss Summers's cat-like eyes, which were
a gooseberry green, twisted her fingers, and blurted out:

"I'm sorry, I got no pinafore. I didn't know I had to have one."

She was relieved when Miss Summers smiled and licked her lips.

"Well, let's make you one for a start-off. Shall we?"

Sally could have fallen down, so astonished was she at this retort. Still she blurted further:

"I got no money for the material."

Again Miss Summers smiled. She might almost have given a purr. She rubbed her cold nose with
the back of her hand, like a cat washing its face.

"That's all right," she said. "We'll find some stuff. It can come off your wages. I want to
see what you can do, d'you see? And that's as good a way as any. I shall be able to notice
how you do it, and give you a word of advice if you want it. And you won't waste much time,
and you won't waste much material. And so why not? Just stand here while I get the length."
As she measured the length of Sally's frock, and allowed a few additional inches for the pinafore,
she sharply said in a low voice that only Sally could hear: "That's right: never use scent.
It's vulgar. From the look of you I was afraid you'd use scent and be saucy. But I'm glad you
aren't."

"Oh, no, miss," answered Sally. Quite truthfully, she added: "I've never thought of using scent.
I don't like it. Only common girls use it." Unconsciously she was emphasising all her sibilants.

"Well, some of the girls here do," said Miss Summers. "Hold still."

The pinafore was a simple matter for both Miss Summers and Sally; and before the morning was
over Miss Summers had visited Madame Gala.

"The new little girl's a quick worker," she said. "Very clever. I think she'll be very useful."

At which Madame Gala raised her straight brows and looked piercingly at Miss Summers. If Sally
could have heard and appreciated the speech as Madame Gala did she would have known that she
had become a favourite at a bound. She did not even guess it, so absorbed was she in deserving
commendation, until the end of the week, when she received her full wages, without deduction.
She was tempted. How easy to say nothing, and take the risk of it being remembered! She could
easily say she was sorry she had forgotten all about it. Then some strong impulse of honesty
made her go up to Miss Summers.

"You haven't taken off the money for the pinafore," she whispered.

"That's all right," said Miss Summers. "Good girl to come to me about it."

Good girl! Sally wondered if she really was such a very good girl.

ii

She was not, morally, being a very good girl; for her mother was still in the hospital, and
she and Toby were taking risks. So far there had been no discovery; but they were getting bolder,
and only the day before going to Madame Gala's, when his aunt had been out for the afternoon
and evening, Toby had had Sally to tea in his aunt's room, and they had sat together over a
good fire, and had silently made love to each other for hours. The more love-making they had,
the more they wanted, and Sally had been living all the week for the time she spent with Toby.
But her mother would be coming home soon, even though she would be unable to work; and both
knew that the wild ecstasy would end with her return. It was that, probably, which made them
less careful, or, if not less careful, at any rate less cautious in the use of their opportunity.
Sally had a dread, which she would not face, and if Toby had any dread he never told her. For
all her feeling of intimacy with him, Sally never reached below his manner and his strength;
and her ignorance of him it was that gave the whole relation its charm for her. He was mysterious,
a compelling strength outside her, a strange man who responded to all her wishes and who loved
her as she wished to be loved--brutally and dominatingly. She was dazzled and infatuated. But
already, in her first days with Madame Gala, she had recovered sufficient of her old coolness
to be set upon definite personal success. This was her strongest impulse. Her love was outside
it, a gratification now, and not a torment. She had no sense whatever of wrong-doing; only
of hostility to her mother because her mother's return would interrupt the tenour of her life.
Once only she said to Toby, secure in her trust of his love and care: "Toby ... if I have a
baby, you'll ... you'll marry me, won't you?" And Toby gave her the necessary promise in obvious
good faith. Neither, therefore, troubled about the future. They were both too anxious to live
only in the exhilarating present.

But at last Mrs. Minto returned, and by that time Sally was living upon money borrowed from
Mrs. Perce, her one friend and protector. Mrs. Minto could not work. She wrote to Aunt Emmy,
and Aunt Emmy helped her from her prizewinnings, and for several weeks they were thus enabled
to stave off want. Once Mrs. Minto was back at home the old order of parsimony was revived,
and it cost them very little to keep life going on from day to day. Sally's seven shillings
a week helped. And at last Mrs. Minto was allowed to go out, and Mrs. Roberson took her back.
Slowly, half-starving, they managed to exist. Sally still had her evenings with Toby, with
their glory dimmed; and as the weeks went on she knew that she was safe from the causes of
her dread, and carried herself jauntily, and she began to earn a little extra money by working
in the evenings for Miss Jubb. This meant that she saw Toby less often, and Toby now had a
man friend from the works where he was employed, and was sometimes with this man Jackson. Sally
had her seventeenth birthday: her figure had improved, and so had her appearance. She was still
meagre, because she had not enough to eat; but some compensation of Nature allowed her to maintain
her health and to mature.

One day, when she had gone to practise upon Mrs. Perce's piano, as she had not done all the
time they had been away from the flat, Sally attracted Mrs. Perce's attention by singing unusually
well. Her friend listened; and then looked into the room.

"What's that you're singing?" she demanded. "Suits you. You'll never be able to play the piano,
Sally, because you'd have to practise every day for hours to do that; but you've got a big
voice for your body. I suppose your lungs are good. Ever heard me sing? It's like a baby crying.
But that song 'The Love Path' suits you. You might do something with your voice. Not much,
I expect; but something. You just try and get hold of somebody who knows about such things.
Might do a turn on the Halls. You never know. If I come across anybody I'll ask them; but I
don't see many people now, and what I do are all in the 'public' line. It's worth thinking
about, for a girl like you, with your way to make. Unless you marry, of course; and you say
you're not going to do that in a hurry. So there you are. Make the most of yourself, I say;
and let the Devil go hang himself if he's a mind to it."

Sally, who had never thought of such a thing, promised. For a time she was flattered by the
vision of singing to audiences. But that soon faded. She met nobody outside Madame's, except
for one or two young men who spoke to her on the way home; and so she kept to her sewing and
machining for Miss Jubb. It pleased her to be able to tell Toby, who, however, frowned, and
did not seem pleased.

"Seems to me you're always thinking you'll do something wonderful," he said sourly. "Doesn't
seem to come to much, as fur as I can see."

"Oh, doesn't it!" cried Sally. She shook herself free from him, and marched off in anger. And
Toby did not follow. It was a tiff. By the next evening both were contrite, and the matter
was never spoken of again. All the same, Sally remembered it. She remembered it the more unforgivingly
because Toby's remark had been true. Nothing so far had happened to prove definitely that her
confidence in exceptional powers was justified. He was jealous of her! Sally laughed almost
scornfully. Fancy a big fellow like Toby being jealous of a little thing like her. Men! They
were all alike. All right as long as they were playing first fiddle! That was it: Toby didn't
want her to have a chance at all. He wanted her always to be number two. Sally shook her head
obstinately.

"All right, Master Toby!" she said to herself. There was no more in it than that--a momentary
revolt;--but once the notion had arisen it began to revolve in her mind. She could not remember
if she had ever told Toby of her plan to be a successful dressmaker; but what would he say
to that? Would he like his wife to make money, and to have real ladies coming to her as they
did to Madam? It seemed from this that he would not. He preferred to be top dog. Sally was
to be nothing upon her own account--merely to fetch and carry, and do what she was told, and
husband his paltry little earnings. He'd rather be poor than owe anything to his wife, in case
she became bigger than himself. Was that it? Was that Master Toby's idea? If so, it was not
Sally's. She suddenly understood that Toby thought of her as his wife, as his chattel; and
that she had never ceased, except in the passionate excitement of their early relations, to
think of herself as one who belonged to herself and was going to make some sort of life for
herself. This came as a shock to Sally. She had never thought of it before. She was beginning
to grow up. From that time she first began to criticise Toby. Until then he had been the burly
man she loved. Her thoughts of him, as her love for him, had been merely physical. She was
now to search more deeply into the needs of life, still crudely, but examiningly. It was not
enough, then, to love a man if you were going to have something else to do in life besides
love him. The idea was new. It puzzled her. It was something outside the novelettes she had
read, and outside her own precocious thoughts. Love was love--all knew that. She loved Toby;
she had given herself to him; they were practically married; and now it appeared that something
was wrong somewhere. Toby did not want her to be Sally: he wanted her to be just a sort of
moon-Toby. Another girl would have wanted nothing better. Sally told herself that she was different.
She went out by herself, one evening, instead of working; and walked up to Highgate. And as
she went up the hill she sang to herself the ballad "The Love Path." It began:

  "When you and I go down the love path together,
  Birds shall be singing and the day so long,"

and she could play the simple accompaniment to it with very few mistakes. She remembered Mrs.
Perce's words. What if she could do something with her voice? Did she sing well? She allowed
herself to glimpse another glorious future.

In the middle of the walk Sally stopped dead.

"Oh, doesn't it...." she said aloud. "Well, we'll just see. We'll just see about it. That's
all." And having as it were made her formal protest she resumed the journey, and arrived home
tired out, ready for bed; and before she had been in bed more than two minutes she was fast
asleep, dreaming of motor cars and footmen standing on the pavement with fur rugs in their
hands. In her dream she was alone in the cars. Even the chauffeur had no smallest resemblance
to Toby. And yet she still loved him with all her heart, and when she was with him she felt
that she extraordinarily belonged to him. Love had again at last encountered ambition, and
battle was joined.

iii

Dreams of luxurious motor-cars, and footmen with fur capes and long fawn-coloured overcoats,
holding fur rugs to cover her knees, were now constant in Sally's mind. She saw such things
occasionally in Regent Street, and loved to look in at the windows of motor broughams upholstered
in fawn-coloured corduroy, with arm straps and little hanging vases of fresh flowers. The freshness
of these cars was her delight. She had no notion of the income it was necessary to have in
order to possess such cars, with their attendant footman and chauffeur; but that income, whatever
it was, became her ideal. Money! Lots of money! With money you could have comfort. When she
said that, and was warned by conventional wiseacres that money did not produce happiness, she
sneered at the timid ones. "Bet I'd be happy," she said. "What's happiness?" She wondered what
it was. For her it had been oblivion in Toby's arms. It was so no longer. That was not all
she desired. It was not by any means all. And she shrank more and more strongly from a life
of squalid toil such as her mother had had--such as she would still have had if Mr. Minto had
been a sober man. All her life she had slaved and slaved, and now she was worn out with it.
Not for Sally! She had other plans. She had gone to the West End, and the West End was in her
blood. She was looking round at life with some of her old calculating determination to exploit
it. The death of her father, the passion for Toby,--these had distracted her. With increasing
confidence in her position at Madam's, and a new sense of what money could actually do in the
way of procuring food and clothes and ordinary or extraordinary physical comforts, Sally had
returned to her old faith. She began to have a little money to buy things for herself. Once
or twice Miss Summers gave her quite good-sized pieces of material, and there were always scraps
to be gathered and utilized. And Sally was enabled to dress carefully. She became the smartest
of the girls in the room, for she had a natural sense of smartness. The other girls did not
like her, but they all envied her and admired her. It was not that she was unpopular; but that
they felt in her the hard determination to get on, and were resentful of her manifest ability
to achieve what she meant to do.

The other girls were all sorted out in Sally's mind. There was not one of them into whose nature
she had not some biting insight. She had become so practised that she knew all their dresses
(as of course all the others did, so that a new one was an event), and knew what everything
they owned had cost. She could recognise anything that had been dyed, any brooch or adornment,
any stockings. She would have made a good house-detective. But she never told tales. If she
knew, she knew, and that was all. It was not for Sally to play the policeman. All knowledge
went into her memory. It would be devastatingly produced on the occasion of a row, but Sally
rarely quarrelled. With her, nothing ever came to a quarrel. There was no need for it to do
so. She was neither jealous nor censorious. One does not quarrel with one who neither loves
nor blames nor is stupid or too anxious to show cleverness. Sally merely "was," and the other
girls knew it. For this reason she was not liked, but neither was she feared or unpopular.
They did not hide things from her, but they did not show them eagerly. Sally was Sally. She
enjoyed being Sally. She meant always to be Sally.

And at last there came into Sally's life, when she had been at Madame Gala's for about six
months, a new interest, and a singular one. One day, when they were all working very hard,
and the electric light was on, Madame came into the workroom with another person. And this
person was a young man with a grey, thin face, rather tall and stooping, with a hesitating
manner, and a general air of weakness. He followed Madame Gala round the room in an idle way,
nodding to several of the girls; and Sally thought he had a very attractive smile. She found
him looking at herself with a pair of large soft brown eyes, like chocolate which has been
in a warm place. It was a rather dumb look. A little nick came between Sally's brows. She was
busy making an inventory of the young man visitor's traits, his features, his clothes. He dressed
well, and he was not bad-looking. With more stamina he might have been almost handsome; but
he was obviously not in good health. The stoop, the vagueness of all his movements, his soft
eye, all betokened as much. Sally turned to Muriel Barrett, who worked next to her.

"Who's he?" she asked, indicating the stranger.

"That's Bertram ... Madame's son. Mr. Merrick, his real name is. But we call him Gaga."

"Wodjer call him that for?" asked Sally. "Isn't he right in his head?"

"Oo, well one of the gels--she's gone now, Mary Smith,--made it up. She said he was Mr. Gala,
you know. Then she called him Bertie Gaga, for fun; and it got to Gaga. I never spoken to him,
so I don't know. Look out, he's looking at us. Oo, I believe he's got a crush on you, Sally."

Presently the young man followed his mother out of the room, and there was a little buzz when
they were gone. The girls leaned together, and whispered, laughing among themselves. Muriel
Barrett turned again to Sally, and became confidential. She herself was a pink, snub-nosed
blonde, with untidy hair, who was always sniffing over her work. She jerked her head at Rose
Anstey, the tall dark girl whom Sally had noticed when first she came.

"Rose thought he was in love with her once," Muriel said. "Well, he was, a bit; but not as
much as she thought. I mean, he used to look at her, and all that, but he never give her anything,
or took her out. I think ... you know ... she's a bit struck on him. That's more like it. She
thinks he's a very tall handsome man. Well, he's not my taste. Funny, if you're tall, I s'pose
you want a tall man to fall in love with you. It's different, being small, I suppose. My Elf's
only about inch taller than me. You can't hardly see there's any difference between us. If
I've got my hair frizzed he looks...."

Muriel went on talking. Sally took a glance at Rose, who, with eyes downcast, was sewing rapidly.
Sally wished she had known that about Rose and Gaga while he was in the room: then she would
have been able to look at Rose and make up her mind about that affair. She did not suppose
really that there was anything in it, either way. Muriel was a little fool--like a little pink
pig. That was just what she was like. And she chattered like a monkey. She had said that because
he looked at her twice Gaga had got a crush on Sally. Well, Sally didn't mind. He could have
any old crush he liked, for all she cared. Gaga was dismissed from her immediate attention,
although she sometimes recollected a pair of soft brown eyes, that made her want to say "Moo"
as if in response to their dumb longing.

The outcome of this visit, which occurred towards the end of May, was a day's outing for the
girls at the beginning of June. They all went into the country by train, on a day which at
first promised to be typical of all days unfortunately chosen for staff outings, but which
cheered up later and became brilliantly fine. Only the girls were there, with Miss Summers
and another forewoman, Miss Rapson, to see that nobody fell into mischief. They had a good
picnic lunch in woods, and ran or walked or sat about all the afternoon, until it was time
for tea. They then trooped into an hotel in which a room had been engaged, and scrimmaged for
places round a big table. The tea was an enormous meal: Sally, who had not hitherto enjoyed
herself any more than most of the other girls had noisily done, felt herself grown to twice
her normal size. It was the biggest meal she had ever eaten, and there were cream and milk
and sugar, and there were cakes and lettuce and jam and all sorts of other encouragements to
appetite. And every time anybody laughed the sound went up to the varnished rafters, and billowed
so much that the two elder women had at last to break in upon a laughter competition. Sally
held aloof from the laughter, scornfully regarding the laughers. She had been rather serious
all day.

And when the noise and fun were at their height Madam and Gaga and another man and woman came
into the room, having motored to the hotel, taken their tea in another room, and determined
to join the party. The tea had been so late, and so prolonged, that it was already nearly eight
o'clock, and as the sky had grown overcast and the day was drawing to a close the lights suddenly
popped up to illumine the faces of both feasters and visitors. A piano was opened at the far
end of the room, and the woman who was with Madam sat down at it and began to play. But only
one or two of the girls danced: the others had eaten too much to be able to do so. Then Rose
sang a song, in which she said that her heart was aching and breaking at somebody's forsaking,
and the girls looked at one another significantly; and there were more songs, and the girls
sat back in their chairs with flushed faces, and each of them in turn seemed to be doing something
to entertain the party. With a bored feeling, Sally was sipping her last cup of tea, when she
became aware that Gaga had taken the chair next to her, and with his chocolate eyes was looking
pleadingly into her face.

"Don't you sing?" he asked. "I wish you'd sing."

"I got no music," said Sally.

"Mrs. Roach would be able to make an accompaniment. She understands music very well--if you
hummed her a song. I wish you'd sing."

Sally rose to her feet. The other girls all watched her with narrowed eyes. She was wearing
such a pretty dress of light grey cotton poplin that she looked smarter than ever, they thought--in
fact, almost pretty. She went close to the piano, and spoke to the pianist. "Oo, swank!" whispered
the girls, when they saw that Sally was to play her own accompaniment. It was a thing none
of them could have done.

  "'When you and I go down the love path together,
  Birds shall be singing and the day so long....'"

sang Sally, in her clear voice, and made everybody arch their brows in surprise.

  "'Your heart mine, and mine in your keeping,
  List while I sing to you love's tender song.
    Ah, love, have done with your repining,
    See how the day is clear;
    Heart of my heart,
    On your fond heart reclining
    Dear, oh my Dear....'"

She played with care, and struck no false notes. She sang her best. Her voice was the best
voice of the afternoon, a mezzo-soprano, but with clear upper register and a fulness that suggested
training. It was not a great performance, but it thrilled the others. Sally had triumphed.
With one accord the girls clapped.

"My best worker," said Miss Summers, rubbing her cold nose and turning to the accompanist of
the afternoon.

"A clever little girl," agreed her neighbour.

But Gaga was stupefied. He had remained in the chair next to Sally's, and when she resumed
her place his mouth was still open with delight and admiration. Again he leaned forward, and
she met his melting chocolate eyes.

"That was beautiful," he said, in a low tone of commendation. "Beautiful!"

"Glad you liked it," she said, almost brusquely. Instinctively she shot a glance in Rose's
direction. Rose, her cheeks mantling, was observing the two with interest. Sally's brain clicked
an impression, and she listened to a stammering from Gaga which aroused her contempt. "He's
hardly a man at all," she thought. "He's soppy. Rose can have him. I wish her joy of him. She
can have him--and twenty like him, if she wants.... I don't know so much about that. Why should
she? She's stuck up. Why shouldn't I have some fun, if I want to? It's nothing to do with Rose
Anstey what I do, and what Gaga does...."

Her demand was unanswerable, because it was addressed to one who did not habitually withdraw
herself lest she should give pain to others. If Rose was jealous, that showed the sort of cat
she was. And in any case, who was Rose? Sally was bright in her responses to the soft voice,
so that Gaga was pleased; but the girls could all see that her manner was cool, and not the
flustered eagerness of a beggar. Rose's neighbour whispered. When the evening was over and
Gaga and his mother had gone, and the girls had all piled into two railway compartments, somebody,
whose voice was unrecognisable in the darkness, called from the other carriage:

"What price Gaga on the love path? Whey!"

There was great laughter. Even Sally joined in it. Going home, the other girls in her carriage
all insisted upon hearing the song again, and as they all had the quick ear of Cockneys they
could sing it in chorus by the time the train reached its journey's end. Sally had become,
for a time, the heroine of the occasion. Only Rose, in the other carriage, had made her protest
against the song and its singer.

"Love path!" she said, in a warm voice of indignation. "She's nothing but a cocket--a white-faced
cocket. That's what she is. She nothing but a white-faced cocket, that Sally Minto!"

From that time onward that was Sally's name among the girls--"Cocket," or "White-faced Cocket."
Rose had coined the phrase which would stick. When Sally heard her name the next day, through
Muriel's indiscretion, she looked over at Rose with pinched nostrils and a little dry smile.
She was flattered. The name was the product of Rose's jealousy and injured vanity; but it was
life to Sally, for it was a testimony--the first she had ever had--to her charm and her dangerousness.

iv

She did not tell Toby the next night about her singing. She rather carefully refrained from
telling him, not out of considerateness, but from a sort of scorn for his jealousy. To herself
she said "Anything for a quiet life." Toby never dreamed that such a person as Gaga existed,
any more than he guessed at any of Sally's encounters with young men on the way home. Sally
had discretion. Had he been a lover, she might have told him; but as he was more to her than
that she saw no reason to arouse his jealousy. And really, if a man spoke to her, and looked
all right, where was the harm in letting him walk a little way with her? She never made appointments,
and after a time, when they found she could take care of herself, and did not want a non-committed
male friend, these fellow-pedestrians soon left her alone. For Sally, each of them was practice.
To mention them to Toby would have been to give them all too great importance. And he might
have made a fuss, and unnecessarily interrupted her fun. "Where ignorance is bliss," thought
Sally, "'tis folly to call out the guard." And, further, "Let sleeping dogs lie until the milk
is stolen." And so Toby pursued his own path, and never knew a tenth of what went on in Sally's
life and mind. Compared with Sally, he knew nothing at all. She grew each day more rusée, more
cunning in knowledge of the world. And Toby blundered where he should have been most astute.
It was his fate.

Sally told him about the outing, because she saw he was in a gloomy mood on the day--a Sunday--after
the girls' treat. She described it at length as they walked in Waterlow Park, hanging on to
his arm, and all the time searching his tell-tale face and guessing at the cause of his manifest
depression. She told about the picnic and the woods, and the tea, and the journey home; and
she saw his mouth slightly open as he grunted. She could see the tiny points of hair that were
beginning to make a perceptible blueness upon his chin, and the moulding of his cheek, and
a little patch of fine down upon his cheek bone, and the hair at his temples which she had
so often kissed. And she knew by his averted eye that something was the matter with him. She
began to try drawing him on the subject--his aunt, had he heard from his mother (who had married
again when Toby was a baby, and lived with her husband in the North), what had he been doing
at the Works? Ah! That was it. Toby had started, and frowned. It was something at the Works.
Oh, he was easy for Sally to read!

"What's the matter?" she suddenly asked. Toby flushed and scowled down at her, very dark and
ugly in his irritation, his mouth twisted.

"Matter?" he demanded. "What d'you mean? Nothing's the matter."

"That's why you're so cheerful, I suppose," retorted Sally--"At the Works, I mean." Toby gave
her a quick, angry look in which there was an admixture of fear and suspicion.

"There's nothing the matter," he said, in a tyrannic voice.

"Have you got the sack?" Sally was merciless. She replied to his tyrannic voice with one as
hard and stabbing as a gimlet. "Ah, I thought that was it. What you been doing?"

"Nothing," said Toby. "And anyway, what's it to do with you?"

"Well, I'm out walking with you. See? And I got to do all the talking. See? And if you're going
to be surly I'll go home by myself. That's what it's got to do with me. And, besides, it is
something to do with me, and don't you forget it. You got no right to keep things from me."

Toby was cowed by her handling of him. He might be strong, but brains are always more potent
than muscle in such circumstances. And men are always afraid of the women they love.

"Yes, I got the push," he defiantly said.

"And what's that for?" demanded Sally, with the severity of a mother to her baby. There was
no answer. "What's that for?" she repeated. "Come on, Toby, you'll feel better if you tell
me about it. Toby, d'you love me? Well, there's nobody about ... quick!" They kissed, and her
arms had been round his neck, and Toby was her sheepish, scowling, smiling slave. Sally had
a faint consciousness of joy in her power.

"Well, you see...." he began, haltingly. "Jackson and I ... we been ... well, we wanted to
make a bit, you see. And--tiddent his fault, but he...."

"Been pinching stuff," said Sally. "Clumsy. Got found out. Well?"

"Well, they found out about me, too."

"What had you been doing?"

"I never took anything; but I found a lot of old things among the rubbish, and I showed them
to Jackson. Well, they asked him if anybody had been with him; and he said 'no.'"

"That was all right," Sally said. "I like Jackson."

"But then the man he'd been dealing with said Jackson had talked about his 'mate.' And they
knew that was me. And I ... told 'em a tale."

"I bet!" cried Sally, scornfully. "And got caught in it, too. Badly!"

"Well, they fired us both yesterday, and said we was lucky they didn't prosecute."

"Did they pay you? What you going to do now?"

"I dunno." Toby stared stubbornly before him. "Get something else, I suppose. Jackson's going
for a sailor. Guess I'll do that, too."

"Go for a sailor?" demanded Sally, with a heart that went dump into her boots. "What d'you
want to do that for?"

"I'd be with Jackson, see, if I went for a sailor."

"And what about me?" Sally's voice was no longer hard or dry. "D'you want to leave me? Are
you tired of me, Toby? I believe you are. Are you?"

"No, I'm not. And I don't want to leave you. But if I went for a sailor I'd make a bit of money,
perhaps, and then after a little while I could come back and begin again. It would get over
having no reference. They'd say 'Where you been working?' and I'd say 'Been at sea for the
last year.' Then they wouldn't know anything but what I told 'em. I wouldn't go long voyages,
Sally. Only just short ones. I'd often come home, and we'd have a spree."

Sally's quick brain was at work. She did not want him to go; but if he went, and if she saw
him often, in spite of his being away, perhaps it would not be so bad.

"But suppose you got wrecked?" she exclaimed.

"Rot. D'you suppose every ship gets wrecked? Don't be a fool!"

"No. But yours might get wrecked. How am I to know, supposing there's a storm? It won't not
get wrecked because you're on it. Would you come home very often? Would you wear sailor clothes?
Wonder how you'd look! Oh, I know--you mean a jersey. Would it have letters across your chest?
Where d'you have to go?"

Sally was so interested that she was even making up Toby's mind for him. By the time they went
in it was decided that he and Jackson were going to sea, and that Sally should be taken down
to visit his ship if it happened to be at the Docks or at Tilbury. She had dancing visions
of Toby in a navy blue jersey, with "Queen of the Earth" or "La Marguerite" or "Juanita" across
it in white letters. She could see his dark hair blown by the wind, and the veins in his wrists
standing out as he hauled a rope. It was rather fun! she thought. "My boy's a sailor." She
would be able to touch him for luck. Sailors were lucky. She sang to herself a song one of
the workgirls knew:

  "Sailors are lads. Sailors are lads.
  Sailors they make you laugh!"

Before night she was wholly reconciled to the idea that Toby would go to sea. She soon had
a dim perception of the fact that it would do him good to go. It would get him away from the
atmosphere of the Works, where there seemed to be a lot of stupid larking and work-dodging.
Now that he was dismissed she began to realise all this. She was glad he was away from it.
She was glad he was going to sea. Healthy m upon the is that material-living things, where the precedent

 Good to be a sailor, and have your money in a lump
like that! Sally thought she would not altogether mind if he remained at sea for a time. He
could save, and she could get on; and then they would both be happy, with a house somewhere,
and a maid, and everything spick and span. No babies. Sally had taken that to heart, and she
appreciated the value of old Perce's advice. A girl who wanted to get on did not need babies
to drag her down. She wanted freedom.

As the clock slowly crawled to the hour of liberation all the girls began to put away their
things, so that a real busyness was observable in the room. Sally was apparently no more eager
than the others, and yet she could hardly keep herself from running to the window to see if
Toby was in the street below. Sedately she prepared to leave, walking down the stairs slowly
instead of rushing at them as she wished to do. She buttoned her little gloves, and set her
hat straight, and made herself appear nonchalant. And that was how it happened that Gaga overtook
her at the front door, and stood with her for a moment upon the doorstep.

"Lovely day it is," Gaga said, agreeably. "You going to get away?"

"Away? Oh, no, I'm going home," Sally said brightly. Then, looking at him, she saw that there
was nothing to disturb the impression that he was a gentleman of leisure. "Oh Mr. Ga-- Mr.
Bertram ... you haven't got your parcel!" she cried.

He slapped one hand upon the other, with a most dramatic gesture.

"Idiot!" he exclaimed. "Thank you so much, Miss Minto. You've saved my afternoon." And with
that, raising his top hat, he went back up the stairs, leaving Sally to congratulate herself
upon her memory and her presence of mind. For she knew the rooms would all be locked by Miss
Summers before she left.

She looked round for Toby, and saw him, as fine as a bird, upon the opposite path. Crossing
over, she took his arm with such pride and delight that Toby, who had been frowning as he greeted
her, was almost appeased. She looked so charming in her very pale green dress with the artfully-brimmed
hat that he also had looked proud and happy at her first appearance. But Toby had received
a shock. Standing there in his dark tweed suit, with a rakish Trilby hat and a fascinating
cane, he had felt a fit companion for any girl, and as he was shaven, and his square face was
browned with the sun and the sea wind, he had been content. And then Sally, looking like a
princess....

"Who the devil's that silly fop?" he demanded, jerking his head.

Sally gave a jump, and a mischievous peep up into Toby's brown face.

"Jealous?" she asked. "That's right: be a man. They're never happy unless they're jealous.
That's Gaga. And if you want to know who Gaga is, he's Madam's son. See?"

"Well, he'd better not come fooling around you," growled Toby. "Or he'll get a thick ear. With
his top hat and his kid gloves and all."

"Hark at it!" jeered Sally. "Quite the little man! Don't you think he's awfully good-looking,
Toby? We're all mad about him. All us girls."

"No, I don't," said Toby, deliberately. "But I expect he's the sort the girls like. Well, he's
got a harem there, and no mistake, all fussing round him. Is he there all the time?"

"No. Toby, what's fertilisers?" Sally's curiosity had been revived. "Don't you know? Oh, shut
up about Gaga. Anybody'd think he was a devil. He isn't. He's soppy. He wouldn't dare to make
love to any of us girls. If I was to look at him he'd run away."

"Yes," said Toby, grimly. "I see he didn't like you looking at him."

"Well, I'll tell you something else, Toby," added Sally, with a persuasively dry candour. "If
Madam was to see me looking at him I should get the sack--spiff! See?"

Toby was impressed. More, he was silenced. They spent a happy afternoon and evening, with no
further reference to Gaga. Nor did Sally think of Gaga during the whole of the weekend. He
might have been mixed and pounded with his own fertiliser for all she cared. For Sally had Toby.

One night Miss Summers and Sally were working late upon a "rush job," and Madam was also in
her room. The girls had all gone; but Sally had been chosen by Miss Summers to help her, and
Sally was always ready to do this because it meant a small addition to her weekly money. Madam
was doing her books, and Gaga was helping her. Sally was sewing busily--beautiful fine work
that caused Miss Summers to purr and lick her lips with relish;--and as they worked they exchanged
remarks which would have been impossible if they had not been alone. Miss Summers always spoke
of the business, which absorbed her, and Sally gleaned innumerable details in this way, without
seeming to be doing such a thing. She, on her side, gave Miss Summers a low-toned picture of
her own life, concentrating upon domestic circumstances and enhancing Miss Summers' respect
for her bravery and her willingness. When they had been silent once for a little while, and
Sally had finished the first of her difficult and gratifying tasks, Sally fell into thought,
and at last said to Miss Summers:

"Wish I knew about accounts. I don't know anything. Is it hard to learn?"

Miss Summers shook her plump face, and rubbed the tip of her nose with the back of her hand.

"No," she reassuringly said. "It's easy. You know what twice one are? Well, that's all it is.
You put down on one side how much you charged, and when you get the money you put it down on
the other side, and draw a line to show they balance. And every month or every quarter you
go through your books, and see who hasn't paid; and if it isn't anybody special you send them
a fresh account. And if it's a real lady you don't worry her. You have to know who's who in
a business like this. That's the chief thing."

"Does Gaga--Mr. Bertram know who's who?"

"No!" Miss Summers's tone was conclusive. "But his mother tells him who to write to, or who
to send an account to, and he knows book-keeping, and how much is at the bank; and he draws
cheques for her to sign, and that sort of thing. Between you and me, Sally--mind, this is quite
between ourselves,--I don't think Mr. Bertram's got a very good head for figures. You have
to be a bit smarter than he is. Of course, he's very kind and good-looking; but if I wanted
good sound common sense I wouldn't go to him. Not a good head for figures. He's not very sharp.
Now Madam's as sharp as a needle. It's funny how a really sharp woman sometimes has a son who's--well,
not so sharp...."

"Would you say I was sharp?" asked Sally innocently.

"Like a knife," declared Miss Summers, with a quick dart of her feline eyes.

"Really?" Sally was eager. She gave a little chuckle of pleasure at such emphatic praise.

"You'd be able to do the books, but you're better where you are. When you've been here another
three months, Sally, you'll be getting more money. It isn't only that you're a good worker,
and quick, but you've got more sense than the other girls. I oughtn't to say this to you. I
don't generally praise the girls here. But if you want to get on, you've only got to stay where
you are. You'll find Madam appreciates you. And so do I."

"You've been awfully good to me," murmured Sally, with downcast eyes. "I'm not just saying
that, Miss Summers; I mean it, every word. When I came here I didn't know anything; and now
I don't know a lot; but...." She gave a small cluck of her tongue, and a smile to show how
much she had learned. It was true. And she was even learning to speak better, through listening
to Madam and Miss Summers and at times a customer; and she had enough sense to avoid the extravagant
refinements of Nosey. Presently she resumed: "Miss Summers, what does Mr. Bertram do? He's
got a business of his own, hasn't he?"

Miss Summers looked across at the door leading to Madam's room, and lowered her voice.

"It's only something Madam put him into. It's a business all to do with farms."

"Farms?" Sally laughed. "Well, he doesn't look much like a farmer."

"No, it isn't exactly farms; but chemical things they use on farms. Now you see there's the
soil." Sally nodded, so deeply interested that she ceased her work. "Some soil's good for growing
things, and some isn't. Well, when a soil's not good the farmers mix stuff with it, to make
it better."

"I know," cried Sally, joyously. "Fertiliser."

"Yes. And then from the good soil they'll get a crop early in the year, and then, by using
stuff, they'll get another crop later. All that sort of thing. And if cows have the mange,
or the rickets, or whatever it is cows have, Mr. Bertram's got something to give them. D'you
see what I mean? And all sorts of chemical things. Stuff to kill weeds, stuff to give chickens
to make them have bigger eggs.... He's got an inventor, and a manager, and others who are interested
in the business, and he's got a share, and he goes to the office and goes about the country
sometimes." Miss Summers screwed up her nose and lips, looking very like an old pussy, and
in a whisper added: "Doesn't really do very much." She put her finger to her lips at that,
and Sally, resuming her work, reassured her by a glance. "Of course," said Miss Summers, "he's
very agreeable, and good-looking, and he's got plenty of money."

Money! Sally's eyelids flickered. She gave a charming grin.

"Wish I'd got plenty money," she said.

"You will have," answered Miss Summers, confidently. "Don't fret. Your time's coming. You're
young yet, and all sorts of things might happen to you."

Sally made no response. She fell into silence for a time. She had learnt with the greatest
interest about Gaga's business, and about the books. She learned a great deal from Miss Summers,
whom she had grown to like very much. She was by no means insensitive to kindness, although
she was not sentimental over it. And, as she thought, she came round again to the two workers
in the next room.

"D'you think Madam will live long?" she unexpectedly asked.

vii

Within half an hour the job was finished, and Miss Summers took it in to Madam. She closed
the door after her, and so Sally could not hear what was said. She stood up, stretching her
arms, and looking down into the street, for it was barely growing dusk, and she could see a
few men and women walking along in either direction. She yawned slightly, raising her hand
to her mouth, her muscles stiff. And as she stood thus she heard the door opened and closed
again, and, still yawning, said sleepily:

"Oo, I'm so tired!"

"Are you?" she heard behind her, in a very soft and sympathetic voice. Sally wheeled.

"I thought it was Miss Summers," she cried.

Gaga stood there smiling shyly, and looking at her with his appealing eyes. In this light he
looked very handsome, and Sally felt almost sorry to see that he also looked tired. His face
was quite grey, and his movements were those of an exceedingly nervous person who would always
shrink from roughness.

"I'm so sorry you should have had to work so late," he said.

"Oo, it's nothing," cried Sally. "Do me good. If I was at home I should only be working there,"
she added, explanatorily. "Work, work, work."

"Don't you ever get any fun?" asked Gaga, timidly. "I mean, go out, or anything?"

Sally shook her head. She was silhouetted against the light.

"No," she told him. "Not often." It was strange how refined her voice automatically became
when she was talking to Gaga. She was altogether restrained. "You can't if you've got to earn
your own living. And have to get here early in the morning."

Gaga hesitated, half turned away, came back.

"I'm very sorry," he said, in his gentle, weak way. "Don't you like it? I mean going out. Or
is it just that you don't get the chance? Poor little girl. Er-- I'm sorry. Er--it's a beautiful
night, isn't it?"

"Lovely," agreed Sally. "I'm going to walk home."

He considered that. He did not seem to have anything more to say. Sally moved to her place,
and mechanically put away her scissors and thimble. She was still in her pinafore, and she
could not take that off and roll it up while Gage was in the room. So they stood there, separated
by several yards. He took out a cigarette case, and lighted a cigarette, throwing the match
under the long table at the side of the room.

"Yes," he said reflectively. "Are you going to have dinner first?"

"Me?" laughed Sally. She shook her head. "When I get home. If I had dinner in London it would
take all my wages, and more, at a single go." She laughed again, but not woundingly.

Gaga looked at his shoes, again at Sally, again at his shoes.

"Look here," he blurted out, "I wish you'd...."

Sally's ears were pricked; but they heard only the opening of the door of Madam's room as Miss
Summers returned. Both Sally and Gaga turned away, as if in slight chagrin. Then Gaga backed
out of the workroom. The conversation was over. It was time to go home. Slowly Sally removed
her pinafore and rolled it, thinking rapidly. Miss Summers was so pleased at Madam's satisfaction
with the dress that she was beaming and purring and rubbing her hands together. She nodded
benevolently at Sally.

"Well, you get off, Sally," she said, in a full tone of delight. "It's quite all right. Madam's
very pleased with the dress. Don't hang about now, but get home to your supper. You've been
a very good girl."

Sally put on her hat.

"Good night, Miss Summers." And as she passed the door of Madam's room she gave a little silent
nod towards it, and a little grimace also. She was out upon the stairs. She was out of doors.
And as she walked along she heard rapid footsteps behind her, shrank a little, and looked up
to see Gaga standing beside her, quite breathless, as if with a hurried journey.

"Er-- Miss Minto," he panted. "I'm sorry.... I ... will you take these? Er--good night."

He raised his hat, and went into the building, leaving Sally mutely clasping a box of chocolates
which he had thrust into her hand. She looked round, but he had disappeared, and she began
to march homeward, still clasping the chocolates. Only when she was in Regent Street with her
treasure did Sally dare to laugh. Then the whole scene came back to her so vividly that she
could control her mirth no longer, but stared, shaking, into a shop window. He must have hurried
out to buy the chocolates after being interrupted by Miss Summers.

"My!" she whispered to herself. "My!" For a time that was all she could say; but as she resumed
her journey she exclaimed: "Chocolates! He never gave Rose anything at all. Ee! He was going
to ask me to dinner. Wish he had! He didn't dare! My word, he hasn't half got a crush on me!
Old Gaga!" She was consumed with delighted laughter, that made her break into smiles at intervals
during the whole of the dismal walk which followed.

viii

"Here, have a chocolate, ma," said Sally. Mrs. Minto was sitting beside the empty grate reading,
with the aid of a magnifying glass, a piece of newspaper which had been wrapped around Sally's
mended shoes. She looked very frail and meagre, but she was very much better than she had been,
and but for the ugliness of the room and the drabness of her clothes she would not have appeared
miserable. She was, in fact, a pathetic figure; but thanks to Sally they were no longer starving,
or in immediate danger of it.

"Chocolates!" cried Mrs. Minto. Then, sternly and suspiciously, she said in her weak voice
of warning, "Where did you get them from, Sally?"

"Won 'em in a raffle," declared Sally.

"Oo, gambling!" reproved Mrs. Minto. "It's very wrong of young girls----"

"Fiddlesticks! They're good chocolates, too," said Sally. "Don't make yourself sick. It's a
nuisance. Besides, I want some myself. I am hungry. I've been working all the evening."

"Working!" grumbled her mother, incredulously.

"Well.... I ... have!" asserted Sally. "Perhaps you'd like me to get Miss Summers to give me
a certificate? You'll see. I shall have a bit more money at the end of the week. Then you'll
rub your eyes. You'll apologise--I don't think! No, I'm a bad girl, wasting my time gadding
about. You never think of that when you get the money, or the money if I'm late."

"Hush! Hush!" begged her mother. "I never said you was a bad girl. You're a very good girl.
But when you bring home a box of chocolates at this hour--nine o'clock, and past--and say you
won them in a raffle, and you've been working--well!"

"What's that you're reading?" asked Sally, pointing to the small print.

Mrs. Minto straightened the sheet of newspaper, and held it up to the light.

"It's an old paper," she said. "A trial."

"Lor! Murder?" Sally almost left her supper. "What's it all about?"

"Well ... oo, he must a been a wicked wretch. He poisoned the old lady. He'd robbed her before
he did it. Took all her money to give her an annuity, and then he poisoned her."

"Poison! Whew! What sort of poison?"

"Flypapers, it was. Not them sticky ones, but the brown, what you put in water. Got arsenic
in them, they have."

"What's arsenic?"

Mrs. Minto looked over her magnifying glass at Sally in a bewildered way.

"I don't know. It's poison. I never poisoned anybody. Not that I know of."

"No," agreed Sally. She thought to herself: "She ought to have poisoned dad. All of us." Melancholy
seized her, a dreadful passing fit of depression. Suddenly she longed for Toby. Aloud, she
proceeded, more seriously: "If it's in the flypapers, why don't we all get poisoned, ma?"

"Well, it seems he soaked the papers, and drained off the water, with the poison in it, and
mixed it with her food--beef tea, and that. She never noticed anything. She had awful pains,
and diarrhoea, and was sick; and then she died, poor thing."

"Hn," said Sally, reaching out for the chocolates. "I'll read it. I like murders."

"Hush!" cried Mrs. Minto, in horror. "Read them--yes; but say you like murders! What wicked
people there are in the world, to be sure. I hope they hanged him."

"Doesn't it say?" mumbled Sally, dealing with a chocolate with caramel inside it.

"It's torn across. It's what I got your shoes in, Sally. It's a.... It's 'Stories of Famous
Trials,' in the Weekly Something.... I can't see what it is."

For the next quarter of an hour Sally ate chocolates and read about the trial of Seddon for
murdering Miss Barrow.

"Miss Barrow!" she exclaimed. "Wonder if she was any relation to old Perce! I'll ask Mrs. Perce
about it. Oo--fancy Tollington Park! Quite near us in Hornsey Road."

Mrs. Minto shuddered, and looked furtively at the clock, longing for her bedtime. Sally caught
the glance, shut up the box of chocolates, and folded the paper.

"You going to work?" asked her mother.

"Wash my hair."

"You're always washing ... washing, you call it!" cried Mrs. Minto.

Sally ignored the sneer, and proceeded to her occupation. There was a silence. Mrs. Minto yawned.
She looked at Sally making her preparations, and into her face came a watchful anxiety that
was mingled with profound esteem. There was a chic about her girl that made Mrs. Minto assume
this expression quite often, and Sally knew it. She knew it now, and was elaborately unconscious
of it. As she waited for the kettle and moved the lamp so that it would illumine the washstand,
she whistled to show how blind she was to any sign of emotion from her mother. When the whistle
was unavailing, she said sharply:

"Don't you think this is a pretty frock, ma?"

Mrs. Minto sighed heavily, and pulled herself up out of her chair.

"Far too pretty, if you ask me," she said. "Looks to me fast." She was full of concern, and
did not try to hide it from Sally.

"Oo!" cried Sally. "You are stupid, ma!" And with that she whipped the dress over her head
and revealed the fact that she wore no petticoat. Her mother was the more outraged.

Sally began to sing.

  "'When you and I go down the love path together,
  Stars shall be shining and the night so fair.'"

"Well, it's a good thing nobody else sees you like that," sniffed her mother, rebukingly. "I
don't know what they would think!"

Sally forebore to make the obvious retort. Her mother prepared for bed.

ix

For the next fortnight Sally did not see Gaga, and only at the end of the period did she learn
that he had been away from London on business. This was one of the journeys of which Miss Summers
had spoken, to the agricultural districts. Sally could not discover whether Gaga actually acted
as traveller for his own firm; but she gathered that he found it useful to see how the country
was behaving itself in the matter of agriculture. She suspected also that he went away for
his health. She speculated as to what he looked like with his handsome coat off, and recalled
wrists that could have been spanned with ease by her own small fingers. In contrast, when she
saw Toby, she saw with swelling pride how big his hands were, and felt his already increased
muscles. Once he swung her clear from the ground with one arm, so that her feet kicked against
his leg in helplessness. He was getting stronger and stouter than ever, and his eyes were clear
and his skin tanned and smoothed by the breeze. She adored him. He wanted her to go away with
him during one of his leaves; but Sally did not dare to go, because her mother had been specially
grumbling and suspicious. So they saw each other rarely for the rest of the year, and their
meetings became the more precious for that reason.

Soon after Gaga returned, Madam went away. She had had no holiday, and she had fallen ill,
with headaches and bilious attacks and a threat of jaundice. So it happened that Gaga came
each day to the dressmaking establishment and took charge of the cash and the accounts, while
Miss Summers and Miss Rapson interviewed any customers who came about dresses. Miss Rapson,
a tall, thin, dark woman, was in another room, with eight girls under her; but Miss Summers
was really in charge while Madam was away, because she understood the whole business, and was
a more experienced woman than Miss Rapson. Sally had hardly ever seen Miss Rapson until this
time, so much did she keep to her own room; but now, when the two who were in charge had to
arrange their work together, there was more interchange. Sally had often to go into the other
room with messages or work, and she came to understand very quickly what went on there. Miss
Rapson was strict, and rather disagreeable. Her girls were like mice, unless she was absent;
and her sallow face gave the clue to her disagreeableness. She did not like Sally at all, because
she was jealous of her. Sally was quick to perceive this, but she did not retaliate. She formed
her own cool conclusions about Miss Rapson. She understood the complexion, and she was more
concerned with the details of the work than with anything else. Besides, she was in a strong
position. She had nothing to fear from Miss Rapson. She soon recognised that she had not much
to learn from her, either. Miss Rapson was forty, angular, shortsighted. She was inclined to
be fussy and self-important and lacking in self-reliance. If anything went wrong she lost first
her head and then her temper. "Hysterics!" thought Sally, cruelly. And Miss Rapson was very
anxious indeed to have the reversion of Miss Summers' place of trust. She had set her heart
upon it, although she knew that as Miss Summers was no older than herself, and as little likely
to marry, she might fruitlessly wait a lifetime. Anything which suggested a possible rival,
even though it might only be in the distant future, was a cause of sleeplessness to her, and
after a sleepless night, when all possible causes of grief, summoned from memory and the inventions
of her own unquiet spirit, came into her head, Miss Rapson was one of the most insufferable
women in the dressmaking. "If I was boss here," thought Sally, "and I had any trouble with
her, she'd go like a shot. Easily get someone in her place." But she did not show that she
was thinking this. She said: "Yes, Miss Rapson. No, Miss Rapson. I'll tell Miss Summers, Miss
Rapson," in the most respectful way. It was Miss Rapson who first suspiciously sounded Miss
Summers about Sally. "Do you think she's deep?" she asked.

Now that Miss Summers had more to do, Sally was very useful to her. Also, Sally came to admire
Miss Summers more than ever. She might be funny, with her eternally cold nose and her cat-like
appearance, but she was an extraordinarily capable woman. She rose to emergencies, which is
the sign of essential greatness. Not once did Sally see Miss Summers lose her nerve. True,
there was no need for diplomacy or large generalship; but when work has to be arranged so that
all customers are satisfied, not only with its quality but with the promptness of its delivery,
a good deal of skill and management is required. Sorry Eldredge precede it grew something in this

 She had solved his mystification. Her small
forefinger pointed to that entry which accounted for the difference in the two casts. Gaga
looked up at her in wondering admiration.

"What a marvellous girl you are!" he impulsively ejaculated. "I've been worrying over this
for ten minutes. Thank you. Er--thank you."

Still she did not immediately leave him, and he made no attempt to move. It would have been
the easiest thing for Gaga to encircle her with his arm, but he did not do so. At last Sally
started away.

"I must go," she said breathlessly.

"Thank you, Miss Minto. I'm.... I'm so much ... obliged," stammered Gaga. She was at the door.
"Oh, Miss Minto...." Sally turned, a mischievous expectancy upon her face. "Er...." Gaga swallowed.
A faint colour rose to his grey cheeks. "I say, I wish you'd come out to dinner with me. I...."

"Oh, Mr. Bertram," murmured Sally. "It's very kind of you. I...."

"Do come. I'm ... so much obliged to you, you know. I mean, I...."

Sally gave a quick nod. She peeped to see that Miss Summers had not returned.

"Well, you see," she said. Then: "All right, I will. Thank you very much."

"To-night? In half an hour? Splendid. I'll be at the corner of the street. Just outside that
big corner place. Thank you. That'll be fine." He was jubilant. Sally went back to her place
with her mouth puckered into a curious smile that nobody could have understood. She felt that
she had embarked at last upon the inevitable adventure with Gaga, and her sensation for the
moment was one of pure triumph. A moment later, triumph was suffused with a faint derision.
She thought how easy it was to handle Gaga. She felt how easy, how temptingly easy, it would
be always to handle him. But all the same she was rather excited. It was the first time she
had been out to dinner with a man. She knew he would look handsome and like a gentleman; she
knew he would have plenty of money. She was glad to think that she was wearing her newest frock,
the smartest she had. Well, she demanded of herself, why not? It'll please him, or he wouldn't
have asked me! Would they have wine to drink? she wondered. A momentary self-distrust seized
her in the matter of table-manners; but she shook it off. She would watch what Gaga did. She
mustn't drink too much. She must mind her step. Then, irresistibly: "What a lark!" murmured
Sally. She was very demure upon Miss Summers' return, and listened with equanimity to a few
remarks made by Miss Summers as to the capacity of Miss Rapson. In reality her thoughts were
occupied with speculations as to the entertainment which lay ahead. So Gaga had never given
Rose anything; more fool Rose! Rose! She didn't know how to manage a man! She didn't know anything
at all. She had been born pretty, and she thought that was all you had to do. Sally had not
been born pretty; she had had to fight against physical disadvantages. It had taught her a
great deal. It had taught her the art of tactics. Sally was very much wiser than she had been
a year earlier. She had learnt immeasurably from her contact with Toby. She had kept her eyes
open. She was unscrupulous. It was of no use to be scrupulous in this world; you lost all the
fun of the fair. Sally was hilarious at her own irreverent unscrupulousness.

Half an hour later she slipped out, and along the street Gaga was waiting. He raised his hat--a
thing Toby would never have done if he had left her so recently--and fell into step beside
her. Sally shot a bright eye full of assurance. As Gaga showed himself nervous, so her assurance
increased.

"Where would you like to go?" asked Gaga.

"Oo, you know better than ... I do," answered Sally, meekly. He stopped for a moment; then
turned eastward; then stopped afresh, hesitating until Sally slightly frowned.

"Yes, we'll go to the Singe d'Or," he explained. "Unless you.... No, we'll go to the Rezzonico.
You'd like to have music, I expect. You know, it's awfully good of you to come. I've wanted
to talk to you ever since I heard you sing so beautifully."

The Love Path! Sally gave a start. What had Mrs. Perce said! Sally might not have a fortune
in her voice, she mischievously thought; but at least she had a dinner! Well, master Toby;
and what did he think of that, if you please?

"I'm very fond of music," she said, glibly.

"I could tell...." There was a pause. "Do you ... do you sing much?"

"No, not much." Sally was speaking like a lady. "Ai ... a ... don't get very much taime. I'm
very fond of. It's so ... it's so...." She was rather lost for a phrase that should sound well.

"Quite, quite," agreed Gaga, eagerly.

"I wish I could play," Sally hurried to say, feeling that she had failed in effectiveness.
He was loud in protest against her modesty. "Well, I mean, I've never--well, hardly ever--had
any lessons. No, nor my voice. It's just ear. Mrs. P---- a friend of maine says I've got a
very quick ear." Every now and then Sally was betrayed into Nosey-like refinement. She fought
against it from an instinctive feeling that it was meretricious. But at the same time she was
speaking with instinctive care, so as to avoid Cockney phrases, and pronunciations, and tones.
She wanted him to think her--something that she called "nice." They walked the length of Regent
Street, chatting thus; and at last reached the gilded Rezzonico, where there were liveried
men who seized Gaga's hat and stick, and maîtres d'hôtel who hurried them this way and that
in search of a table in the crowded, din-filled room. The walls were covered with enormous
mirrors which were surrounded by gaudy mouldings. Tables were everywhere, and all appeared
to be occupied. Men and women in evening dress, men and women in morning clothes, some of the
women painted, others ordinary respectable members of the bourgeoisie, were sitting and dining
and smoking and chattering loudly. Glasses, cigarettes, bottles, all sorts of dishes, strewn
upon the tables, caught Sally's bewildered eye. Above all, a scratching orchestra rasped out
a selection from one of Verdi's operas. A huge unmanageable noise of talk and laughter swelled
the torrent of sound. Deafened, her nerve destroyed, Sally timidly followed the apparently
aimless wanderings of Gaga and the maîtres d'hôtel, her shoulders stiff with self-consciousness
in face of so many staring eyes and well-fed, well-dressed creatures; and at last they found
a table. It was a bad table, in the middle of the room, near the band and the cash desk and
a sort of sideboard into which bottles were ceaselessly dumped. "a hundred Smith saw you let me go

The directness California own a picture, the collection of counterpoint,

"Poor man!" murmured Sally.

"You know, you're kind, Sally. I can see your little bright eyes shining; and they make me
... they make me...." He was once again the old, incoherent Gaga, fingering his unused cheese
knife and looking at her with an expression of pathetic helplessness that made Sally wary lest
she should betray amusement. "I feel you understand. You're not very old, Sally; but I feel
you understand. And.... I've always felt that. You're such a wonderful little girl. I mean...."
He broke off with a gesture of vague despair of his power to say what he actually did mean.
"I feel you can help me."

"Can I?" asked Sally, swiftly. "I'd love to."

"Would you really?" Gaga's tone was a fresh one, one of hope and light.

"Course I would," responded Sally. Already she was aware of practical advantages. Her heightened
spirits were sobered immediately. But her face did not betray this. Her face continued the
demure face of a young girl, not from any artfulness, but because she was in fact a demure
young girl, and her hidden mental calculations did not yet show in her habitual expression.

"You'll be friends with me?" Gaga said, as though he asked a great favour.

"If you'll let me," answered Sally, as though she conferred one.

The movement of hands was almost simultaneous, but it began with Sally. Gaga clasped her left
one in his right. Only for a minute. Then Sally could not resist a giggle, and the compact
was unsignalised. They talked further, Sally once again in a state of delight, and Gaga inclined
to be repetitious. And then, as it was nine o'clock, Sally said she must go. He saw her to
her omnibus, and they parted as friends. From her seat inside, as the bus moved off, Sally
waved to him; and afterwards settled down to the journey, full of memories and reflections
of a curious and enchanting character. Not of Gaga were these reflections, save with an occasionally
frowning brow of doubt; but of the remarkable vista which had been opened by his demand for
friendship and help. An excited recollection of the lights and the mirrors and the overwhelming
noise of the restaurant intoxicated her afresh. Her whole face was shining with excitement.
She smiled to herself, occupied with such a mixture of sensations and imaginings that at one
moment she wondered whether she was Sally Minto at all, and whether some magician had not changed
that Sally for a new creature born to spend her days in gaudy restaurants and among all the
noise and luxury of such a life as she had led this evening for an hour and a half.

One moment at home was enough to convince Sally that no magician had been at work. It was the
same squalid house, and the same squalid room that she reached after the splendour of her dinner.
And it was the same fretful mother who complained of her lateness and chided her for the dangers
she ran in being about the streets so late. Sally made no answer. She looked in the mirror
at the dilated pupils of her glowing eyes, and at her flushed cheeks and laughing lips; and
her heart first sank and then violently rebelled against the contrast of this hideous place
with the light and colour she had left. She was a rebel. The contrast was too great. How could
she live in a room like this? How could anybody live? It was not life at all, but a mere grovelling.
And Sally had tasted something that thrilled her. She had come into contact with a life resembling
the life led by those who travelled in the motor broughams she so much admired. She was ravenous
for such a life. Her natural arrogance was roused and inflamed by the comparison she so instinctively
made between her natural surroundings and those to which she felt she was entitled by her capacities.
She thought with contempt of the other girls at Madame Gala's. The wine she had drunk, the
noises she had heard, mounted higher. She was primed with conceit and excitement. Hitherto
she had only determined by ambition to use the world and attain comfort and success. Now she
felt the power to attain this success. She could not experience the feeling without despising
every other feeling. She looked round the room in scorn--at the dull, shabby bed, and the meagre
furniture, and at the little old woman who sat by the empty fireplace with so miserable an
air of confirmed poverty. She looked higher, at Miss Jubb, and saw afresh the stupid incompetence
of such a creature. Even old Perce and Mrs. Perce led in her new vision a life that was good
enough for them, but not good enough for Sally. There was a better way, and Sally would not
rest until she had secured that way. And she had the opportunity opening to her. Gaga had shown
her as much. With the vehement exaggeration of youth that is still half-childhood, Sally saw
her own genius. She felt that the world was already in her grasp. She felt like a financier
before a coup. She felt like a commander who sees the enemy waver. For this night triumph seemed
at hand, through some means which the heat of her brain did not allow her to analyse, but only
to relish with exultation.

x

In the morning Sally had a heavy head as the result of her unusual entertainment, and she awoke
to a sense of disillusion. The room was the same ugly room, but her dreams had fled. So must
Cinderella have felt upon awaking after her first ball. The colours had faded; the rapturous
consciousness of power had died in the night. Sally felt a little girl once more, younger and
more impotent than she had been for months. The walk to Regent Street restored her. She once
again imagined herself into the talk with Gaga; she stressed his offer of friendship and his
plea for help. It would be all right; it was all right. She had made no mistake. Only, she
was not as carelessly happy as she had been in the first realisation. She had recognised that
the battle was not yet won, and that much had still to be done before she could claim the victory
which last night had seemed in her hands. At all events, hatred of her little ugly home was
undiminished. She felt horror of it.

Arrived at the work room, Sally saw it in a new light. She was permanently changed. The girls
had become nothing; even Miss Summers had become a very good sort of woman, but subtly inferior.
There was not one of the girls who could help Gaga as she was going to do; not one of them
who could earn the advantages which Sally was going to reap. She settled almost with impatience
to work which last night had been left unfinished. All the time that she was engaged upon it
her thoughts were with other prospects, other deliberate intentions. She was restless and uneasy--first
of all until she had seen Gaga and gauged her effect upon him in the morning's grey, finally
because another secret conflict was going on beneath her attention. She did not understand
what she was feeling, and this made her the more easily exasperated when cotton knotted or
a sudden noise made her head throb. "I'm out of sorts," she thought. She tried to laugh in
saying: "The morning after the night before." Her malaise was something more than that.

Gaga came into the room during the morning, haggard and anxious-looking. The lines in his pallid
face were emphasised; his eyes had a faintly yellowish tinge like the white of a stale egg.
In shooting her first lightning observation of him Sally clicked "Bilious." There was a little
smile between them, and Gaga went out of the room again, languid and indifferent to everything
that was occurring round him. Sally had an impulse to find some reason for going into his room,
but she did not dare to go. She sewed busily. Perhaps she would see him later. She peeped into
the room at lunch-time, but he was not there, and in the afternoon she heard from Miss Summers
that he was unwell, and would not be coming back that day. She heard the news with relief;
but also with sudden fright. If--if--if he should have become afraid of her! If he should have
repented! If, instead of allowing her to help and to benefit, Gaga should become her enemy!
Men were so strange in the way they behaved to girls--so suspicious and funny and brusque--that
anything might have happened in Gaga's mind. Sally recollected herself. This mood was a bad
mood; any loss of self-confidence was with her a sign of temporary ill-health. She magnificently
recovered her natural conceitedness. She was Sally.

In the evening she went home early, to her mother's interest and pleasure; but there was nothing
to do at home and the atmosphere was insufferable. It drove her forth, and she walked in the
twilight, longing for Toby to be with her. He would not have understood all she was thinking--he
would angrily have hated most of it--but his company would have distracted her mind and occupied
her attention. She thought of Toby at sea on this beautiful evening, with the stars pale in
an opal sky; and she could see him standing upon the deck of the "Florence Drake" in his blue
jersey without a hat, with the breeze playing on his crisp hair and his brown face. A yearning
for Toby filled her. Tears started to her eyes. She loved him, she felt, more than she had
ever done: she needed him with her, not to understand her, but to brace her with the support
of his strong arms. Sally dried her eyes and blew her nose. "Here!" she said to herself. "Stop
it! I'm getting soppy!"

She presently passed the ugly building of a Board School, not the one which she had attended,
but one nearer her present home. Outside it, and within the railings protecting the asphalted
playground from the footpath, was a notice-board upon which was pasted a bill advertising the
evening classes which would be held there during the Autumn Session. Idly, Sally stopped to
read down the list of subjects--and the first that caught her eye, of course, was dressmaking.
She gave a sniff. Funny lot of girls would go to that. Girls trying to do Miss Jubb out of
a job. Sally glimpsed their efforts. She had seen girls in dresses which they had made themselves.
Poor mites! she thought. Paper patterns for somebody twice their size, and bad calculations
of the necessary reductions. Tape-measures round their own waists, and twisted two or three
times at the back, which they could not see. Blunt scissors, clumsy hands, bad material....
It was a nightmare to Sally. She did not go far enough to imagine the despairs, the aching
hands, the tears, which attended the realisation of an evening's botch. She was not really
a very humane person. She had both too much imagination for that infirmity of the will, and
not enough. She passed from dressmaking to the other subjects.

There was one that made her jump, so much did it seem to be named there for her own especial
benefit. It was "Book-keeping." Sally was taken aback. She scanned the details. Two lessons
a week, on Mondays and Thursdays, at eight o'clock. A disdain filled her. She would not be
as the other girls. She would learn book-keeping. She would understand figures. Then she could
help Gaga with precisely that work which he confessed himself unable to do. Sally memorised
the details. It was enough; she was ready for anything. As the following Monday was the first
night of the session she would be present then.

And so, her ambition mounting once more to arrogance, Sally returned to bed and her mother,
and bread and margarine, and the dingy room on the second-floor-back.

xi

The book-keeping class was held in one of the ordinary classrooms, separated from others by
high partitions of wood which were continued to the ceiling in panes of glass. The room was
filled with forms and desks, but the class was so small that all those composing it (and there
were fewer still after the first six lessons) were put into the first two or three rows of
desks. The teacher was a little sandy man who made well-trodden jokes and talked in a wheezy
voice well suited to his appearance. He used the blackboard, and stood upon tiptoe to scrawl
upon it in a large handwriting. That was at the beginning. Later, methods developed; but for
the present Sally and the others were merely initiated into the first movements of the difficult
craft. With amazement she began to learn the mysteries of the signs "Dr." and "Cr.", the words
"Balances", "carried forward", etc. and the meanings of such things as ruled diagonal lines.
It was to her like the game of learning chess, and she had the additional pleasure of knowing
that with the solution of each problem she was adding appreciably to her knowledge, and to
a knowledge which henceforward would not be wasted, as she could turn it, as of all things
she most desired, to immediate use. Madam's accounts would no longer be a source of trouble
or bewilderment to her. She knew very soon that they would be mere child's play to her instructed
intelligence.

From the teacher and the lessons, Sally turned to her fellow pupils. There were about twenty
of these, the sexes almost equally represented, but with the girls in a slight majority. One
or two of the young men were pale and spectacled, and so they did not interest her. The girls
were generally of a higher class than her own, were obviously already employed as clerks in
offices, and were rather older than herself. They were the daughters of tradesmen or clerks,
and all lived at home in the better streets of the neighbourhood. They were neatly dressed,
but she was easily the smartest of the audience. The other girls looked at her hair and her
complexion, and then at each other; and a feud began. Sally was consoled by the evident interest
of the young men, who often cast glances in her direction. She sat demurely, as if unconscious,
but in her wicked heart there was glee at the knowledge that this same young person Sally,
once the despised companion of May Pearcey, had in a year attained such new charm as to be
attractive to these young men. She shrugged her shoulders at the thought of it. Had she been
an onlooker she would have been amused or cynical. As she was the cynosure of the emotional
eye of the whole class she could view the natural processes of all such gatherings with satisfaction.
Her shrugs were for the respectable and alienated girls, who were like sparrows chattering
over a brilliant intruder; to the young men she offered an air of imperviousness to their cajoleries
which made her seem to at least three of them a young person whom it might be pleasant and
titillating to know. The general arrangement of feelings towards her was evident at the third
lesson. By the fourth it had taken a quite definite form. She had exchanged conversation with
the three men: she had smiled provokingly at the girls. The girls mentioned her at home, and
to their friends; the young men did not mention her to anybody.

The men were all older than she, were in employment, and although some of them were still at
home the majority of them were in lodgings in Holloway, were lonely, and were desirous of improving
their positions. This was the case with Sally's three admirers. Of the three, her immediate
favourite, because he most nearly resembled Toby in physical type, was a thickset dark young
man with a budding black moustache and polished eyes and a strong pink upon his cheekbones.
But after she had looked at him a few times she decided that he had Jewish blood, and Jews
were among her aversions. So, although his name was Robertson, she passed him over in favour
of a tall, rather bony fair youth of about three and twenty with smooth hair and a lean, conceited
humorous face. He had assurance, which she adored, and his great length made it queer to be
talking to him, because she had to look high up to see his face. He always wore a light-coloured
tweed suit, and a knitted tie of about ten different colours, and his aquiline nose and jaunty
manner gave him an air of knowingness which she much appreciated. He was a stockkeeper in a
publishing house, and came from the South of England. His voice was light in tone, and he had
a delightful burr. This young man, Harry Simmons, became her friend and soon walked part of
the way home with her after each lesson. He talked politics to her, and explained all sorts
of things which she had never before known. He told her how books were made, and how they were
delivered unbound in great bales; and when she said "a book" meaning "a paper," he corrected
her. Sally liked him. Of the three men she now knew well he was the best-informed. Accordingly
she learnt more, intellectually, from him than from either of the others. He quickly fell in
love with her, which was an added pleasure; and she once or twice let him kiss her, without
promising anything or revealing the existence of Toby. She never kissed Harry in return, a
fact which she cherished as a proof of her innocence. But she liked him very much, and told
him more about herself than she had ever told anybody else. And as there is nothing like the
use of such care and such flexible and uncertain kindness, when it is not calculated, for tantalising
a young man who is agreeably in love with a young girl, Sally had a new delight, a new self-flattery,
to cosset. The affair did not become very desperate in Harry's case--he was too conceited,
and he knew the rules of the game too well--and at length it subsided normally; but it lasted
pleasantly and instructively enough for perhaps four months, and the memory for both was one
of smiling amusement, untempered by chagrin. Sally's one dread in the whole course of her friendship
with Harry was a dread lest Toby should see them together. That Harry should see her with Toby
she did not mind, because she could at any time have relinquished Harry without a qualm; but
she loved Toby, and took care to keep secret from him on their infrequent meetings anything
which might disturb his ardent thoughts of the little girl he had left at home.

So book-keeping went on. And so Harry went on. But by now Sally's interests had become many,
for she was leading a busy life, and the difficulty of maintaining all her affairs at the necessary
pitch of freshness and importance in her attention was increasing. She had to think of her
work, of Madam and her now frequent fits of illness, of Gaga, of Miss Summers, of money, of
Harry, of book-keeping, of clothes, and of her mother. Mrs. Perce she rarely saw during this
period, because as Sally found new preoccupations she was bound to shed some of her old ones.
She thought very nicely of Mrs. Perce; but she had at the moment no time for her. Mrs. Perce
belonged to a passing stage, and had not yet a niche in the new one. Toby she saw still more
seldom than anybody; but for Toby Sally's feelings underwent no obvious change. They developed
as her character matured, but they did not alter. She embraced him, as it were, with her mind.
Toby was somehow different from all the others. He was a part of herself. She did not know
why, but he stood alone, whenever she thought of him, wonderfully strange, and strong, and
enduring, as much Toby as she was Sally. She did not fear him. In some ways she despised him,
for being so little pliable, so little supple in his way of managing the world. But she adored
him as a man, and as a simple-minded baby who unerringly made her happy by his assurance, and
flighted her by behaving as though she was something belonging solely to himself. So long as
she was confident that about nine-tenths of her life was outside the range of Toby's understanding,
Sally enjoyed his delusion. It gave her such a sense of superiority that she relished her submission
to his will in all trifles. She never felt that his absences made him a stranger. Rather, she
felt that they increased and intensified her love and her desire for him. These at least were
unabated--more ardent than ever. And the absences certainly made Toby all the more boisterously
glad to see her whenever he returned from a voyage, and more demonstratively affectionate when
they were alone together.

xii

Madame Gala had returned to work and Gaga had gone into the country by the time Sally had joined
her book-keeping class; and so that matter seemed to be in abeyance. The ease with which the
fabric of her newest plan had been made to collapse discomfited Sally, who was always impatient
for quick results; but she did not abandon hope. She believed in her star. She had seen very
little of Gaga since their dinner. He had avoided her, with some tokens of slight constraint,
although his greetings had been almost furtively reassuring. That alone would have made her
believe that he had not forgotten his promise. Sally bade despair stand back. Always, hitherto,
she had found her own level: she would do it again in this instance. She had the grit of the
ambitious person who succeeds. Hers was not a vague or unwarrantable conceit: she would work
for its fulfilment. It is the mark of the great.

While she was waiting, she one day received a letter from Toby, announcing his imminent arrival
in London. He would wait outside Madame Gala's, and they would spend his leave together. It
was now the beginning of October, and a fine Autumn had begun. The days, although rapidly growing
shorter, were warm and cordial. They were better than the summer days. There was a crispness
in the air, but there was no chill. Filled with pleasure, Sally wore her prettiest clothes
that morning, and Toby was waiting in the sunshine at the corner of the street, and they met
with light hearts. It was just one o'clock. At once they found a tea-shop, and had lunch; and
then Toby sprang upon her a proposal that they should go to Richmond for the afternoon, and
to Brighton the following day. He appeared to have plenty of money for both jaunts. He had
planned them as soon as he knew the date of his arrival.

"O-o-o!" cried Sally. "Brighton! The sea! Will you take me out in a boat? Better not: I should
be sick. Take me on the river this afternoon, instead. No: we'll just walk in Richmond Park.
Ever been to Kew, Toby? The girls say it's lovely there. What's Brighton like? I went there
once when I was a kid. Wasn't half fine. What d'you do there? Sit on the beach and throw stones
in the water? We might paddle. Like to see me paddling? What time do we start?"

"Here, hold on," said Toby. They were walking to catch a Richmond omnibus. "You ask a lot of
questions and don't wait for no answers. I say ... look at that young woman there.... Look at her!"

"Well?" demanded Sally. "It's only because her shoes don't fit. She doesn't know how to wear
high heels. That's all it is. That frock cost a bit."

"Did it?" Toby jerked his head. "Well, you ought to know, I suppose. It's not as smart as yours."

"D'you like it, Toby?" asked Sally, eagerly. He had never said anything before about her clothes.
She was suddenly sportive with pride in his interest.

Toby nodded. He had been betrayed into his speech of approval. It was not natural to him.

"It's all right," he nonchalantly said. "I've seen worse."

Sally shook his arm, provoked by a variety of feelings. She loved him to tease her. How strange!
She felt a hundred years older than Toby, and yet she felt like a little girl. And when she
was with him she did not have to mind her tongue, but could be as slangy and as natural as
she pleased. Toby did not know any better. She had not always to be thinking, with him, of
what a real lady might be expected to say. He was a relaxation for her.

"That's right," she said. "Flatter me. Make me get swelled head. Don't think of the consequences.
Ladle it out. Tell me I look a little princess."

"No, Sally. I wouldn't do that," answered Toby, possessively. "I don't want you to get above
yourself. You're a bit uppish as it is. Noticed it? Well, I have. And that's a thing I want
to talk to you about."

"Oh," said Sally in a dangerous tone. "What is? Look, there's a bus!"

With Sally's nimbleness and Toby's muscle they obtained seats upon the top of the bus, and,
seated together, resumed their conversation in low, grumbling tones. She first repeated her
question with new aggressiveness, not at all deterred from the possibility of a row by her
delight in Toby's company.

"About you," said Toby. "You see, smartness is all very well; but if you're going to be a sailor's
wife you got to look where you're going. Now, your last letter. It said you was being a good
girl, and taking evening classes--that's because I told you my aunt see you out with a fellow
one night, coming from the schools. Now what the Hell's the good of evening classes to a sailor's
wife; and who is this fellow aunt seen you with?"

"I suppose even a sailor's wife wants to know how to cook," remarked Sally.

"Oh cooking," grimly said Toby. "Does the fellow learn cooking, too?"

Sally was impudent. She was enjoying herself. She rejoiced that he should be so jealous and
authoritative when she knew that she could always play with him.

"I don't know which fellow your aunt saw," she answered flippantly. "There's so many of them
at the classes. I can't tell which it might be. Did she tell you what he was like?"

"She told me you was arm in arm."

"That's a lie," said Sally, curtly. "Nosey old cat. She never saw me arm in arm with anybody.
And even if I had been, what business is it of hers? What does she know about me? About me
and you?"

"She see us last time I was home. See us twice. That's why she told me about you and this other
fellow. See? She says--that girl I see you with seems to have got another young man--light
come, light go."

"O-o-oh!" Sally gritted her teeth. "I would like to have your aunt by the back hair, Toby!
Old cat! She's made it up, I expect. Interfering old beast! But, after all, there's a lot of
fellows at the class, and we all come out together, and sometimes they walk a bit of the way
home with me. That's all it is. Nothing to make a fuss about. I'm not a nun, got to pass men
by on the other side of the road, am I?"

"Well, I won't have it!" cried Toby, restless in his seat. His dark face was darker. There
was a red under his tan, and a gleam of his teeth that made him like an angry dog. "And that's
enough of it. I won't have it. You belong to me. See? And if I catch another fellow nosing
round I'll split his head open. Damned sauce! Just because I'm away, you think you can go marching
about...."

He sulked for several minutes, frowning, and biting a torn thumbnail.

"What you done to your thumb?" demanded Sally taking it quickly between her own fingers. Toby
made no answer, but, very flushed, drew his thumb away. With her chin a little out, and an
air of quietly humming to herself, Sally looked at all the shops and houses upon their route,
and at the people walking sedately upon the pavements. As it was Saturday afternoon, many of
the West End stores were shuttered; but as the bus went farther west, and into suburban areas,
there was great marketing activity. Sally watched all the people and observed all the shops
with an absorbed childish interest that was almost passionate in its intensity. She took no
notice of Toby for a quarter of an hour. He might not have been there. This was his punishment
for being outspoken and suspicious. She was not going to have that sort of thing from anybody.
But if Sally was supercilious, Toby was stubborn. Once his grievance had been voiced, and had
been taken flippantly, he was reduced to glowering. At Sally's continued disregard, and after
a going over in his own mind of all they had said, Toby began to feel uncomfortable. He began
to feel a fool. At the precise moment when his sensation of foolishness was strongest upon
him, Sally turned and slipped her arm within his, and pressed his elbow warmly against her
side. They did not speak; but peace was made. Presently Sally began to draw Toby's attention
to things they passed, and although at first he was surly in his responses, Toby was gradually
and surely appeased by her masterly handling of him. He was not free from suspicion--she did
not want him to be, because it enhanced her value; but he was dominated by her cajolery.

When they arrived in Richmond, and had climbed the hill, and had looked down from the Terrace
Gardens upon that lovely piece of the Thames which is to be seen from the height, Sally and
Toby walked arm in arm about the Deer Park. They saw the leaves falling, quite yellow, although
the trees were still dense with foliage; and the crisp air exhilarated them. In the sun it
was hot and dazzlingly bright.

"Tell me about what you've seen, Toby," suddenly asked Sally.

"Seen?" Toby fumbled a minute in his mind. "What d'you mean--seen?"

"At sea, and when you go ashore. You know. Ships and places."

Toby looked puzzled. "Well, what's there to tell?" he questioned. "A ship's a ship. You wouldn't
understand if I was to tell you I'd seen a schooner, or a barque, or a cattle-boat, or a dinghy."
He was rather lofty. "I mean, you wouldn't know."

"How do you know, then? How can you tell the difference?" she persisted.

Toby laughed at the fact that she had not recognised how he had slipped in the dinghy among
recognisable ships. He had supposed everybody knew what a dinghy was. He pointed that fact
out to Sally, who could not see that she had betrayed such glaring foolishness. Pressed to
confine himself to comparable vessels, Toby condescendingly resumed:

"It's a question of the size, and the rig.... All that." He was elaborately the expert, sure
that an amateur could never understand. Sally might have retorted with baffling words about
seams and camisoles and voile; but she was shrewd in mystic silence. "You'd have to see the
ships.... Then I could point it all out to you. I mean, a gunboat or a cruiser or a trawler....
What I mean, they're different. See a big liner going out from Liverpool: I tell you, it's
a sight. Flocks of people, and the old thing moving along like grease. Leaves you standing.
At first you don't half feel a fool. But on a boat like ours there's no time to look about.
We're under-manned. That's what it is. Not enough of us to make it light for everybody. Ought
to be altered. Got to be doing chores the whole time. Swabbing down, cooking----"

"Can you cook?" Sally was swift, arch, incredulous.

Toby grinned. Then he remembered her classes--her "cooking" classes--and his aunt's message,
and grew suddenly serious.

"Look here, Sally. That cooking. I don't like them other fellows," he said. "I mean to say,
meeting them at classes, and walking home, and that."

Sally held his arm tightly. A look of scorn appeared upon her face. In her heart a feeling
arose of impatience and amused enjoyment of his concern about a thing that was to her so trivial
compared with her love for himself.

"You going to begin that again?" she demanded. "Silly. Here, put your face down. There! D'you
think I don't love you. Think I don't believe you're worth ten of those others? Well, I do.
And that's enough of that."

Toby was obstinate. He wanted her to be his property. Nevertheless, his tone was milder.

right, but what do they think?"

 Sally had no word with him, because he could not speak
to her in the workroom or in his mother's room, and because she never met him (as she half
expected to do) in the street. Sally often thought of their evening together, but gradually,
as Gaga took no further step, she became sceptical about his plan, and she hardened towards
him. Already her active mind was casting about for new outlets. She visited Mrs. Perce, and
repaid ten shillings of the amount she owed her. She wrote to Toby, walked with Harry Simmons,
had conversations with Miss Summers and Muriel and Mrs. Minto. And so the days passed. But
at length Gaga took the awaited step. He met her one evening, as if by accident, upon the stairs,
and immediately stopped. She had gone past him when Gaga found his tongue, and checked Sally's
progress by a stammering. She waited.

"Er ... I never ... see you now," he began. Sally looked up at his tall figure, thrown sharply
into relief by the clear light from a window upon the stairs, and by the pale grey distemper
of the wall behind him. Again she noticed that creeping redness under the grey of his cheeks,
and the almost liquid appeal which he directed at her. "I ... er ... I meant to ask you....
To-morrow...."

"Oh, thank you, Mr. Bertram! I'd love to," cried Sally, quickly. He was passionately relieved,
as she could see. Not only by her acceptance of his intended suggestion, but at the salvation
of his tongue.

"At the corner? Seven o'clock? At the corner? Where ... where ... where we met before? Really?
Fine!" He nodded, and took off his hat, and climbed the stair. Sally, very sedate, descended.
Well, she was still all right, then. How strange, she was quite cool! She was not at all elated!
That was because of the delay, which had encouraged indifference; but it was also because the
invitation was expected and because Sally was no longer to be shaken as she would have been
by a novelty. She was ready. She was once again a general surveying the certainties of combat
with a foe inferior in resources to herself.

So the next evening she deliberately stayed later than the other girls, and worked on with
a garment which had occupied her attention all the afternoon. She was doing some plain embroidery
upon a silk frock. It was upon this occasion that she received a great mark of favour from
Miss Summers. Miss Summers, trusting Sally entirely, showed her how to lock the door after
her. She had just to slip the catch, and slam the door, and nobody could enter the room without
first using a key. And Miss Summers went, leaving Sally alone in the workroom. It was a thing
hitherto unknown. It showed trust which had never been given to one of the other girls. Apart
from Madam and Gaga, if one or both of them should still be working in Madam's room, Sally
was at liberty, and in sole occupation of the establishment. It did not occur to Sally to think
so; but Miss Summers would never have given her this privilege if she had not known that Madam
also would approve. It would have been too dangerous a responsibility for Miss Summers unsupported.
Madam must have seen that petty theft was a thing which did not tempt Sally. She was too ambitious
for that, and obviously so. Keen judge of character as Madam was she must have known it all.
But neither Madam nor Miss Summers could have realised--as both, with their experience of girls,
should have done--that there were possibilities other than theft. Sally had listened to the
explanation of the door catch, and had promised to shake the door when she left, so as to make
sure that it was fast; but her only conscious thought had been one of surprise and delight
that she should be left alone. Alone to do as she pleased. Alone to sing, dance, loiter. Alone,
perhaps, with Gaga. At that notion she had a curious little thrill of excitement. Her eyes
became fixed for a moment. She did not speak, or give any other sign. She was not thinking.
Merely, her general awareness was pierced by a sudden ray.

Had she been sure that Gaga was by himself in the next room, Sally would have found some excuse
to go in there. It would have been such an opportunity as she had never had before. But although
she went close to the door, and listened eagerly, there was no sound within. The room might
have been empty. Or Madam might be there; and if Sally sang, which would please Gaga, Madam
might come out, find her in the workroom without real excuse, and give her the sack. Sally
was too wise to believe that in such a case Gaga could save her. She could imagine him stammering
a defence, and being crushed, and perhaps being kind to her for a little while and fussing
about to find her a job elsewhere. And that would be the end of that. She neither sang nor
whistled. Every now and then she again listened, until she was impatient with uncertainty.
Her impatience made her laugh. Fancy being impatient for seven o'clock! And for Gaga! It wasn't
natural. It was--like Gaga himself--ridiculous.

Seven o'clock struck before she was ready; but Sally did not care. She had no objection to
the thought of Gaga waiting in patience at the corner of the street. Toby would have been a
slightly different matter. Not that she was more afraid of Toby now than she was of Gaga. All
the same, she would not have kept him waiting. Neither Toby nor Gaga would have kept Sally
waiting. Toby would have been punctual; Gaga had been standing at the corner already for five
minutes. It was a curious moral effect that Sally had. She was not to be treated lightly. Even
now, she was learning her power, and in this case she was illustrating it. She did not join
Gaga until she was satisfied that every smallest fold in her dress was in perfect order, her
hat precisely at the desired angle, her gloves buttoned. Then, shutting the door with a steady
bang which rendered any shaking needless, she kept her appointment, not a timid dressmaker's
assistant, but a woman of the world. At seventeen--for she had not yet reached her eighteenth
birthday, although it was now very near--she was more of a woman of the world than she would
be at twenty-eight, when her first intuitions had been blunted by actual experience.

Gaga was standing thoughtfully leaning upon his walking stick. His shoulders were bent, and
the slim, and rather graceful, outline of his figure made him appear almost pathetic in his
loneliness. Sally--Sally the hard and ambitious--was struck by a sharp irritation and pity,
almost by compunction. She did not know what her feeling for Gaga was; but principally it was
composed of contempt. He had good looks, and he had money. He could help her at present as
nobody else could do. But at heart Sally dismissed him with a word which, to her, was fatal.
He was soppy. Not mad, not altogether stupid, but painfully lacking in vital energy and confidence.
Of all things Sally best loved assurance, and Gaga had none of it. He drooped in waiting, and
the message of his fine clothes was contradicted by his pose, and not reinforced by it.

"I'm sorry I'm late," she said perfunctorily, at his start of recognition and delight. Gaga's
face changed completely. From one of gloom, his expression became one of joy. "I didn't notice
the time. I was working there alone-- Miss Summers had gone. I was finishing something. I didn't
know if you'd gone or not. I couldn't hear anything from Madam's room. Didn't like to knock,
or anything."

Gaga said nothing. He walked by her side, and Sally looked up at him almost as she might have
done at a policeman or a lamp-post. He was tall, she thought, when he straightened his back.
And he dressed like a prince. At that instant she was proud to be walking by his side. She
thought: "I must look a shrimp beside him! Him so big--so tall, and me so little. But I'm as
smart as he is, any day in the week. Wish he always held himself up like that! What salmony
lips he's got, and ... it's his long lashes that make his eyes look so soft. Chocolate eyes....
Funny! He's got a weak chin. No, his chin's all right. It's ... you can't see his jaw at all:
goes right in, and gets lost. And a funny nose--got no shape to it. Just a nose." She had the
curiosity to wonder what his grey cheek felt like. She would like, one day, to touch it with
her finger, just to see. It looked dry and soft. All this she glimpsed and considered like
lightning while they walked quickly towards Piccadilly Circus; and her notions gathered and
grew in Gaga's silence.

"Were you working?" Sally presently asked, trying to say something to begin a conversation.

Gaga shook his head, stealing a shy glance down at her.

"No. Not working," he said. "I had rather a headache, so I went for a walk in the Park."

"Oo. Sorry you've got a headache." Sally unconsciously became sympathetic. "Is it very bad?
It's nerves, I expect. Whatever may have been the emotions observe of delay, except you must be assume
that the consternation was physical silence of the Government [5]. "The miner and miners were,
and could simply, but in softening, and so been trespassers upon
the civilian lands at Government of the States, been worth no laws
to t, get or protect them, and with nothing to fright from the dead
polity.

This conjecture, being few last sob, must now be taken as truthful fellows.
No goal would be made.
 It was a mistake, because it illustrated his lack of initiative and his powerlessness
to strike out a fresh path. He made straight for the Rezzonico again. He ought to have taken
Sally to another restaurant; but he instinctively took her to the place where they had dined
happily before. In that he betrayed to her merciless judgment the fact of his inexperience.
Silently, they entered the big dining-room. The band was not playing at the moment, and, as
they were early, the room was less full than it had been upon the first occasion. The enormous
mirrors reflected their hesitating movements. Gaga made his way vaguely towards their former
table; but Sally laid a hand upon his arm. It was time for her to take command. Into her expression
there crept the faintest hardness, almost a tough assurance, that was tinged with the contempt
which was her deepest feeling for Gaga.

"Couldn't we get a table against the wall ... down there?" she demanded, pointing.

It was done. They were installed, and a young and rapid waiter was attending to them. This
time Sally helped to choose the dinner. She could not read the menu, because she knew no French;
but the waiter, with an uncanny insight, realised that he would do well to address her and
to explain the dishes to Sally instead of to Gaga; and so, to the relief of all three, they
were quickly served, and wine was brought, and Sally began to feel creeping upon her all the
old pleasure and excitement of noise and wine and an intriguing situation. Her hardness vanished.
She sat almost with complacency, breaking her roll with two small hands, and looking at Gaga
with that thin little grin which caused her meagre face to be so impish and attractive. The
brilliant lights which made Sally more and more piquante had a ghastly effect upon Gaga. His
grey cheeks were cruelly betrayed.

"I'm afraid mother's ... mother's not what she ought.... I'm afraid mother's ill," began Gaga,
stammering. Then, impulsively: "I say.... I'm so glad you came to-night. I.... I've been--you
know, my head-- I've been miserable, and.... I've been bad-tempered all day. But I'm better
now. Couldn't help ... feeling better, seeing you there...." 

Here, it is state, that in the bloomed exuberance in her self immaturity, she danced alternatively
into prayed before the oracle. Of the glory of these sunrises and day-background
and hour, she surpass her childhood and merry of muliebrity. Sally's
eyes looked green in the electric light--green and dark and dangerous, like deep sea; and her
pallor was enhanced, so that she was almost beautiful. There was something both naïve and cat-like
in her manner, and the tilt of her head. She surveyed Gaga with eyes that were instinctively
half-closed. She could delightedly perceive the effect she was having upon him. He sometimes
could not look at her at all, but fixed his attention upon his plate while she was speaking,
or no higher than her neck when he was himself--as he rarely did--making an attempt to entertain.
And all Gaga's hesitations and shynesses made Sally amused and sure of herself, and she began
to take pleasure in dominating him. When she found that Gaga not only did not resent this,
but was pleased and thrilled by her domination, Sally grew triumphant. She chose the sweet
for them both, sweeping her eye down the prices and listening to the waiter's translation of
each title. She sipped her wine with a royal air of connoisseurship. And she kept such control
of the situation that Gaga was afraid to give words to the timid ardour which shone from his
expressive glance. Sally was herself: it was still she who conferred every favour, and not Gaga.

Presently she had a thought that whipped across her mind like a sting.

"D'you know what I've been doing since we came here before?" she demanded. "I've been taking
lessons in book-keeping. I'm getting on fine. The teacher says I've got a proper head for figures.
He says I shall be a cashier in no time, and understand all that you can know about accounts.
Isn't that good? So I shall be able to help you--like you said...."

Gaga gave an admiring gesture. He was overwhelmed.

"Oh, but you're ... marvellous!" he cried. "Simply marvellous! Here's Miss Summers says you're
the best hand, for your age, that she's got...."

"Did she say that?" Sally jumped for joy. "Really?" She gave a triumphant laugh, so naïve and
full of ingenuous conceitedness that Gaga was overcome afresh with admiration.

"You ought to have been two people," he answered. "Two little girls."

"Half a dozen!" Sally proclaimed. "You see, I'm--it sounds conceited, and I expect I am; but
it's true-- I'm clever. I'm not soppy. Other girls-- Rose Anstey.... They're soppy. They can't
do anything. I can do all sorts of things because I'm clever-- I can sew, and ... you know,
all sorts of things."

Gaga glowed at her words.

"I know," he eagerly agreed. "That's why you're so wonderful. Most girls can only do one thing.
They can't even do that very well."

"That's true. Takes them a week to do it; and then somebody has to do it over again for them.
They haven't got any brains. They got no sense. They don't think." Sally was impetuous.

"They've got no brains at all," said Gaga. "They're like vegetables." Both laughed, in great
spirits and familiarity. "Well, Sally.... My mother's.... She's a wonderful woman, too. She's
been marvellous. Marvellous! She must have been like you...."

Sally shrugged.

"Bigger than me," she murmured, brooding upon an unwelcome comparison.

"No. Not bigger. She's nearly three times as old as you. My father died, you see.... I was
a child. She had to make a living. Had to."

"So have I got to," whispered Sally. "I got no father; and mother's in her second childhood."

Gaga stopped. He looked at her. A singular expression crossed his face.

"Now, you have to," he said. "Er, I mean.... Well, ... you won't always." 

Four among she had united slavery, and one was a admission of State. Being.... Congress, as that s at
the House, of this time, and i know she well what you remember i.
Of them was not more jurisprudence, the effect had betrayed in sally'California,
a creation in territories to Mother and lineal S, a admission of
Texas, and the happening in boundary.

[6] "upon the Congress of the new Commonwealth passed what is called
more series of compromise measures.

 Sally could not tell whether he was thinking or whether the wheels of
his mind had altogether ceased to revolve. His mouth gaped a little. At last he concluded:
"I wonder if I could ... if I could borrow you from Miss Summers. If she'd mind. If she'd let
you go."

There was a silence, while both thought of this possibility.

"Look here," cried Sally, confidently. "Like this evening, Miss Summers left me there--all
alone. I mean to say, she didn't mind. She wouldn't leave any of the other girls like that;
but she left me. No californian should be unfamiliar in the great logomachy on what was to constitute
the western State of the bounds by CA, a debate accompany with the candlepower
of feeling which of an terminal about wrecked the convention.

Sally was really prompting Gaga in this last sentence. He frowned, and moved one of his long
hands impatiently across some crumbs which lay before him on the table.

"Oh, money...." he said. "More than overtime. We'd.... I say, it's splendid of you. It's a
splendid way to do it."

"Would you like it?" breathed Sally, her heart beating faster at the implication. Gaga reddened.
His lips were pressed together.

"It would be perfect!" he cried, vigorously.

"How lovely!" Sally's face broke once more into that expressive grin. They sat smiling at each
other, almost as lovers do who have stumbled upon an unsuspected agreement in taste. The mood
lasted perhaps a minute Then it changed ever so slightly. "Would Madam mind?" next urged Sally.

Gaga's face clouded. She was watching him breathlessly, and saw his fists clenched. His tongue
moistened the lips so lately compressed. His head was inclined. At last, dubiously, he spoke.

"I wonder," he muttered. "I haven't said anything to her. I don't think...." His face fell
still more, until it was undetermined. "I'm afraid.... I'm afraid ... perhaps she mightn't
like it. You see, she's ... she's ... rather.... She doesn't like anybody.... She mightn't
quite ... understand."

Sally's contentment vanished abruptly. Her heart became fierce, and her tone followed. It was
rough and hard, with a suggestion of despair and of something less than respect for Gaga.
