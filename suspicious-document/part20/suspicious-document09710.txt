On the afternoon of the fourth day Miss Peggy came down to tea with her pigtail smoother and
more glossy than ever, and the light of war shining in her eyes.  She drew her chair to the

opportunities.  This hour, which is given to us for our own use, might be turned to profit
and advantage, instead of being idly frittered away--
