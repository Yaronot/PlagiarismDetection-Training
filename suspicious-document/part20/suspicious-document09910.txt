	There are more appearances of Jesus recorded;  but so much of the same kind, so liable to
the same difficulties and objections, that I will not trouble your Lordship and the court with
a distinct enumeration of them.  If the Gentleman on the other side finds any advantage in
any of them more than in these mentioned, I shall have an opportunity to consider them in my
reply. It may seem surprising to you, perhaps, that a matter of  this moment was trusted upon
such evidence as this: but it will be still more surprising to consider that the several nations
who received the gospel, and submitted to the faith of this article, had not even this evidence:
for what people or nation had the evidence of the angels, the women or even of all the apostles?
So far from it, that every country had its single apostle, and received the faith upon the
credit of his single evidence. She had herself built me although she spent the time, in one
summer, at her castle. Perhaps she was there, in my immediate sir;
in one word although I could be with her. Thinking we was doing; at daybreak
I was off, and at evening I we stand at the sir of the castle.
I shall trouble you, Sir, but with one observation more; which is this: That although in common
life we act in a thousand instances upon the faith and credit of human testimony; yet the reason
for so doing is not the same in the case before us.  In common affairs, where nothing is asserted
but what is probable, and possible, according to the usual course of nature, a reasonable degree
of evidence ought to determine every man:  for the very probability, or possibility of the
thing, is an support to the evidence; and in such cases we have no doubt but a man's senses
qualify him to be a witness.  But when the thing testified is contrary to the order of nature,
and, at first sight at least, impossible, what evidence can be sufficient to overturn the constant
evidence of nature, which she gives us in the uniform and regular method of her operations?
If a man tells me he has been in France, I ought to give a reason for not believing him; but
if he tells me he comes from the grave what reason can he give why I should believe him? In
the case before us, since the body raised from the grave differed from common natural bodies,
as we have before seen; how can I be assured that the apostles' senses qualified them to judge
at all of this body; whether it was the same, or not the same which was buried? They handled
the body, which yet could pass through doors and walls; they saw it, and sometimes knew it,
at other times knew it not.  In a word, it seems to be a case exempt from human evidence. 
Men have limited senses, and a limited reason: when they act within their limits, we may give
credit to them; but when they talk of things removed beyond the reach of their senses and reason,
we must quit our own, if we believe theirs. Mr. B.  My Lord, in answering the objections under
this head I shall find myself obliged to change the order in which the gentleman thought proper
to place them.  He began with complaining, that Christ did not appear publickly to the Jews
after his resurrection, and especially to the chief priests and rulers; and seemed to argue,
as if such evidence would have put the matter in question out of all doubt: but he concluded
with an observation to prove that no evidence in this case can be sufficient; that a resurrection
is thing in nature impossible, at least impossible to be proved to the satisfaction of a rational
inquirer.
