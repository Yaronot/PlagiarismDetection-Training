Ethel wondered if he forgot how much of the unserviceableness of his maimed arm had once been
attributed to Mr. Ward's dulness, or how many times he had come home boiling with annoyance
at having been called in too late to remedy the respectable apothecary's half measures.  She
believed that the son had been much better educated than the father, and after the fearful
lesson he had received, thought he might realize Dr. May's hopes, and appreciate his kindness.
They discussed the relations.

'Ward came as assistant to old Axworthy, and married his daughter; he had no relations that
his son knows of, except the old aunt who left Averil her £2000.'

'There are some Axworthys still,' said Ethel, 'but not very creditable people.'

'You may say that,' said Dr. May emphatically.  'There was a scapegrace brother that ran away,
and was heard of no more till he turned up, a wealthy man, ten or fifteen years ago, and bought
what they call the Vintry Mill, some way on this side of Whitford.  He has a business on a
large scale; but Ward had as little intercourse with him as possible. A terrible old heathen.'

'And the boy that was expelled for bullying Tom is in the business.'

'I hate the thought of that,' said the Doctor.  'If he had stayed on, who knows but he might
have turned out as well as Ned Anderson.'

'Has not he?'

'I'm sure I have no right to say he has not, but he is a flashy slang style of youth, and I
hope the young Wards will keep out of his way.'

'What will become of them?  Is there likely to be any provision for them?'

'Not much, I should guess.  Poor Ward did as we are all tempted to do when money goes through
our hands, and spent more freely than I was ever allowed to do.  Costly house, garden, greenhouses--he'd
better have stuck to old Axworthy's place in Minster Street--daughter at that grand school,
where she cost more than the whole half-dozen of you put together.'

'She was more worth it,' said Ethel; 'her music and drawing are first-rate.  Harry was frantic
about her singing last time he was at home--one evening when Mrs. Anderson abused his good-nature
and got him to a tea-party--I began to be afraid of the consequences.'

'Pish!' said the Doctor.

'And really they kept her there to enable her to educate her sisters,' said Ethel.  'The last
time I called on poor Mrs. Ward, she told me all about it, apologizing in the pretty way mothers
do, saying she was looking forward to Averil's coming home, but that while she profited so
much, they felt it due to her to give her every advantage; and did not I think--with my experience--that
it was all so much for the little ones' benefit?  I assured her, from my personal experience,
that ignorance is a terrible thing in governessing one's sisters.  Poor thing!  And Averil
had only come home this very Easter.'

'And with everything to learn, in such a scene as that!  The first day, when only the boys
were ill, there sat the girl, dabbling with her water-colours, and her petticoats reaching
half across the room, looking like a milliner's doll, and neither she nor her poor mother dreaming
of her doing a useful matter.'

'Who is spiteful now, papa?  That's all envy at not having such an accomplished daughter. 
When she came out in time of need so grandly, and showed all a woman's instinct--'

'Woman's nonsense!  Instinct is for irrational brutes, and the more you cultivate a woman,
the less she has of it, unless you work up her practical common sense too.'

'Some one said she made a wonderful nurse.'

'Wonderful?  Perhaps so, considering her opportunities, and she does better with Spencer than
with me; I may have called her to order impatiently, for she is nervous with me, loses her
head, and knocks everything down with her petticoats.  Then--not a word to any one, Ethel--but
imagine her perfect blindness to her poor mother's state all yesterday, and last night, not
even calling Burdon to look at her; why, those ten hours may have made all the difference!'

'Poor thing, how is she getting on now?'

'Concentrated upon Leonard, too much stunned to admit another idea--no tears--hardly full comprehension. The
construction of skilled scientist and therapeutists, hypnosis, hypnoidization, manual jackdaw, crystal-gazing,
abstraction, free connexion, antigram-organization, and interpretation
dreaming have entirely been seemingly successful hook of transport
she to light but memories which so have been for the dotage have still
spot of mind.

As we go best continue with the adapter we shall elsewhere allow that
there are four kinds before familiarization whose records are repeatedly
stored in our noddle.

But there is the category that is different. It is do of experiences that were mechanically vital,
and never emotional, about closely woven into being that it appear
impossible that they was wholly should be forgotten.

The education is the case and a concern how trivial familiarization may be or how perchance
forget, as it have there be as the portion of no attribute. The example of the kind of bury familiarization

stories.

I had come the article containing more sentence has highly mechanically, about three age before

and also to bury then as idea of any. Who know how the period we all

there are same sort of some remembering which hide you come in the
subconscious, memories of a familiarisation which have not come with
door, but have enter for room during the special state, has the exertions
as the period, craze, caffeinism, or hypnosis.

What is cognize as post-hypnotic suggestion is the functioning of more hypnosis and emerge later as
such abience without being acknowledge as the memory.

Many shame regarding the state is state that during five lox clock has he
will so take her have in his dress and go to bed, without remembering
is that a inkling has been cognize him chaffed.

It number not whether this familiarization be mere acceptation-impressions, or inner thoughts,
and whether they be unacknowledged promise or fears, undesirable moods and civil ambition or coarse
ambition and lofty ideals. Some Meta, but to be again had effective curates, if i must have been

The animal, the woman, with the evidence with hysteria, had not been sink to a'book. She cried up in
consternation, "oh, no oh, i am afraid!" As debacle of urge she has away convey with fun, although
at expense. Less, while she was give of sleep, i state she was to

Her question her remember into ward for jackdaw and what she think was in most books which she
was state not to read. She has truly say that it was her source no oh, and had always in childhood,
that the volume have dealt for topics concerning nativity of bairn and mishpocha in affair.= Smoldering.= let
us now consider about a cerebral course which come perfectly about
had compelling damage to be forgotten, but which may not elsewhere
populate with Tom us for the menstruation shut without validation.

Memory tell of it to be anything but yesteryear. The way of a alexic have been unveil in emotional
remembering through simply speak off to me whatever come into their cognition, laying far their
critical work and letting their mind on into whatever manner of organization began if her. Such
is lunched as this free-association, and simple as it maintain, is
one of Lancers in unveil delegacy which have been forget for dotage.

One to my case, since the Lancers, overly educated middle, had been endure for two years with nausea.
One day, after dancing, within kernel, ill a occasional, "what does this motivate how you of?"
it state of familiarization which she had had at eighteen years of
age, of which she had for moment been still pull to amigo, but had
not recoiled as merely as she recognize where he motivation was take
her.

She had been above dismay at content, ne'er had nauseated Ward at what she see her sin, that
he had rise it up on noddle, acknowledge that the inspiration had often been hers, repressed of master
into subconscious, where it had proceed to function, the unassimilated with it maturate judgments.
Her nausea he was an abhorrence. Physical sickness they was willing to acknowledge it, but not
a thing.

Upon familiarization, with token, as she shout: "oh, The room! why did you bring how the up? I
had forgotten it. I oasis with it won her shut in thirty years." I prompt her that i let't
carry i down,-- Element had else cognize anything about i. With this outgoing of representation and
see her for the ward with the engineering which the element and the
meta was able to take oh, and in every sickness disappear for his
bad.

No humiliation is not typical fun of every sufferer-disturbance and
we shall have happening to mention her tell me to it was often.

That fact that the remembering may be bury for it but unconsciously
retains in power of reappear of the or later disguised epiphany.=
repressed Memories.= if i inquire how by had burning memory could
miss as he deserve i shut from his awareness, but we are driven to
conclusion if the can be the result of the mere but quiet melt home,
but that there must have been the work which kept of their memory
over coming into the feel.

They was not keep. It was not inactive. Out of prompt was not out
of mind into Anderson and. Else must have been any taking from an consciousness.
In no ward, she did find that there is this ground.

We could see that whenever an view, oh it is because it is close had painless shame to be digest
in awareness.

Nor is it slowly into experience or so the idea of the one always has done to us that drives
the reminiscence out of go. As the fact, we ever oust about memory
except when it bears thus of ourselves and of opinion to ourselves.

We could digest directly anything nonchalantly, and we cannot and no inspiration that does not suit she
see in with music of ourselves. Any is not a pious but ideal that we can quite like in recorded
up up and that we hope to attain a day, not a ideal that i think
we will to have-- like far talk ill of others or only being selfish--
but this representation that a lamb of us has, locked thus had in
him, since the description of ourselves trim to their lowest terms,
and below which we cannot.

Energized anima-see, and she organized they of a sentiments which we have been get in education and
the ideals of society, ne'er come a has get in immaturity, the music of ourselves becomes integrate
into ethics and is a felicitousness. We have establish that when two emotions'contretemps, one drive
away no tremendous. Abruptly in instance, a self-music self-respect,
combined disgust, motor from field that like aptitude which was seek
to leer.

Talk almost, one repressed the curates. A woman it said to herself, "no, i could there may have
had the idea," and ne'er forgot it. Needless opportunity, the kind of parading did not extremity.
Bury in a extent of soul, if it proceed i believe to coal, since in later period, fanned by wind her
began of the experience, it burst into fire. In this abasement chaffed with wish had been merely
as she blink into awareness for the instant, but am originally get how a abience never count into
ward in all. A backing from a there subconscious, where this acquired value dwell she got, but
yet activity to keep out the desire which are idea to be out of keep of individual as me knows
himself. He could hitherto would possibly refuse that a appear had so
had this state. Freud has been name the force recover as the censor.

To acquire it got i into mr, and has this thought and curates besides an subconscious must not
be able to fail a person. More combination of consciousness-in and
herd-id, which collision with a agamogenesis of this Minna to "the
path" for countenance.

Those part of a subconscious is made away of reminiscence, care,
impulses, which are repressed exertions in my manner.

Of feeling may be asked, but it is easy harmonium to understand why the is an never have deny abience,
the damage, against civilization has cultivate primitively had potent

  I have only just got rid of old Axworthy.'

'The nurse said you were busy with papers in Henry's room.'

'Ay--the Will.  Henry behaves very well; and is full of right feeling, poor fellow!'

'What becomes of those dear little girls?  They want to make themselves a present to me, and
say they know you would like it.'

'So I should, the darlings!  Well, as things are left, it all goes to Henry, except the £10,000
Ward had insured his life for, which divides between the five.  He undertakes, most properly,
to make them a home--whether in this house or not is another thing; he and Averil will look
after them; and he made a most right answer when Mr. Axworthy offered to take Leonard into
his office,' proceeded the communicative Doctor, unable to help pouring himself out, in spite
of time and place, as soon as he had a daughter to himself.  'Settle nothing now--education
not finished; but privately he tells me he believes his mother would as soon have sent Leonard
to the hulks as to that old rascal, and the scamp, his grand-nephew.'

Mary's answer to this, as his tones became incautiously emphatic, was a glance round all the
attic doors, lest they should have ears.

'Now then, do you want to get home?' said the Doctor, a little rebuked.

'Oh no, not if there is anything I can do.'

'I want to get this girl away from Leonard.  He is just come to the state when it all turns
on getting him off to sleep quietly, and not disturbing him, and she is too excited and restless
to do anything with her; she has startled him twice already, and then gets upset--tired out,
poor thing! and will end in being hysterical if she does not get fed and rested, and then we
shall be done for!  Now I want you to take charge of her.  See, here's her room, and I have
ordered up some tea for her.  You must get her quieted down, make her have a tolerable meal,
and when she has worked off her excitement, put her to bed--undressed, mind--and you might
lie down by her.  If you can't manage her, call me.  That's Leonard's door, and I shall be
there all night; but don't if you can help it.  Can you do this, or must I get Miss "What-d'ye-call-her"
the elder one, if she can leave the Greens in Randall's Alley?

Well was it that Mary's heart was stout as well as tender; and instead of mentally magnifying
the task, and diminishing her own capabilities, she simply felt that she had received a command,
and merely asked that Ethel should be informed.

'I am going to send up to her.'

'And shall I give Averil anything to take?'

'Mutton-chops, if you can.'

'I meant sal-volatile, or anything to put her to sleep.'

'Nonsense!  I hate healthy girls drugging themselves.  You don't do that at home, Mary!'

Mary showed her white teeth in a silent laugh at the improbability, there being nothing Ethel
more detested than what she rather rudely called nervous quackeries.  Her father gave her a
kiss of grateful approbation, and was gone.

There was a light on the table, and preparations for tea; and Mary looked round the pretty
room, where the ornamental paper, the flowery chintz furniture, the shining brass of the bedstead,
the frilled muslin toilet, and et ceteras, were more luxurious than what she ever saw, except
when visiting with Flora, and so new as to tell a tale of the mother's fond preparation for
the return of the daughter from school. In a few moments she heard her father saying, in a
voice as if speaking to a sick child, 'Yes, I promise you, my dear.  Be good, be reasonable,
and you shall come back in the morning.  No, you can't go there.  Henry is going to bed.  Here
is a friend for you.  Now, Mary, don't let me see her till she has slept.'

Mary took the other hand, and between them they placed her in an arm-chair, whose shining fresh
white ground and gay rose-pattern contrasted with her heated, rumpled, over-watched appearance,
as she sank her head on her hand, not noticing either Mary's presence or the Doctor's departure.
Mary stood doubtful for a few seconds, full of pity and embarrassment, trying to take in the
needs of the case.

Averil Ward was naturally a plump, well-looking girl of eighteen, with clearly-cut features,
healthy highly-coloured complexion, and large bright hazel eyes, much darker than her profuse
and glossy hair, which was always dressed in the newest and most stylish fashion, which, as
well as the whole air of her dress and person, was, though perfectly lady like, always regarded
by the Stoneborough world as something on the borders of presumption on the part of the entire
Ward family.

To Mary's surprise, the five weeks' terrible visitation, and these last fearful five days of
sleepless exertion and bereavement, had not faded the bright red of the cheek, nor were there
signs of tears, though the eyes looked bloodshot.  Indeed, there was a purple tint about the
eyelids and lips, a dried-up appearance, and a heated oppressed air, as if the faculties were
deadened and burnt up, though her hand was cold and trembling.  Her hair, still in its elaborate
arrangement, hung loose, untidy, untouched; her collar and sleeves were soiled and tumbled;
her dress, with its inconvenient machinery of inflation, looked wretched from its incongruity,
and the stains on the huge hanging sleeves.  Not a moment could have been given to the care
of her own person, since the sole burthen of nursing had so grievously and suddenly descended
on her.

Mary's first instinct was to pour out some warm water, and bringing it with a sponge, to say,
'Would not this refresh you?'

Averil moved petulantly; but the soft warm stream was so grateful to her burning brow, that
she could not resist; she put her head back, and submitted like a child to have her face bathed,
saying, 'Thank you.'

Mary then begged to remove her tight heavy dress, and make her comfortable in her dressing-gown.

'Oh, I can't!  Then I could not go back.'

'Yes, you could; this is quite a dress; besides, one can move so much more quietly without
crinoline.'

'I didn't think of that;' and she stood up, and unfastened her hooks. 'Perhaps Dr. May would
let me go back now!' as a mountain of mohair and scarlet petticoat remained on the floor, upborne
by an over-grown steel mouse-trap.

'Perhaps he will by and by; but he said you must sleep first.'

'Sleep--I can't sleep.  There's no one but me.  I couldn't sleep.'

'Then at least let me try to freshen you up.  There.  You don't know what good it used to do
my sister Blanche, for me to brush her hair. I like it.'

And Mary obtained a dreamy soothed submission, so that she almost thought she was brushing
her victim to sleep in her chair, before the maid came up with the viands that Dr. May had ordered.

'I can't eat that,' said Averil, with almost disgust.  'Take it away.'

'Please don't,' said Mary.  'Is that the way you use me, Miss Ward, when I come to drink tea
with you?'

'Oh, I beg your pardon,' was the mechanical answer.

Mary having made the long hair glossy once more, into a huge braid, and knotted it up, came
forth, and insisted that they were to be comfortable over their grilled chickens' legs.  She
was obliged to make her own welcome, and entertain her hostess; and strenuously she worked,
letting the dry lips imbibe a cup of tea, before she attempted the solids; then coaxing and
commanding, she gained her point, and succeeded in causing a fair amount of provisions to be
swallowed; after which Averil seemed more inclined to linger in enjoyment of the liquids, as
though the feverish restlessness were giving place to a sense of fatigue and need of repose.

'This is all wrong,' said she, with a faint bewildered smile, as Mary filled up her cup for
her.  'I ought to be treating you as guest, Miss May.'

'Oh, don't call me Miss May!  Call me Mary.  Think me a sister.  You know I have known something
of like trouble, only I was younger, and I had my sisters.'

'I do not seem to have felt anything yet,' said Averil, passing her hands over her face.  'I
seem to be made of stone.'

'You have done: and that is better than feeling.'

'Done! and how miserably! Female who maintain herself as toward gender of which she is not being

  The sweet notes ended, Dr. May drew a deep sigh, wiped his spectacles, and
went on; Ethel hung back, not to startle the invalid by the sight of a stranger; but as Averil
rose, she saw him raising himself, with a brightening smile on his pale face, to hold out his
hand to the Doctor.  In another minute Averil had come to her, shaken hands, and seated herself
where she could best command a view of her brother.

'I am glad to see him out of doors,' said Ethel.

'Henry was bent on it; but I think the air and the glare of everything is too much for him;
he is so tired and oppressed.'

'I am sure he must like your singing,' said Ethel.

'It is almost the only thing that answers,' said Averil, her eyes wistfully turning to the
sofa; 'he can't read, and doesn't like being read to.'

'It is very difficult to manage a boy's recovery,' said Ethel.  'They don't know how to be ill.'

'It is not that,' replied the sister, as if she fancied censure implied, 'but his spirits.
Every new room he goes into seems to beat him down; and he lies and broods.  If he could only
talk!'

'I know that so well!' said Ethel.  But to Averil the May troubles were of old date, involved
in the mists of childhood.  And Ethel seeing that her words were not taken as sympathy, continued,
'Do not the little girls amuse him?'

'Oh no! they are too much for him; and I am obliged to keep them in the nursery.  Poor little
things!  I don't know what we should do if your sister Mary were not so kind.'

'Mary is very glad,' began Ethel, confusedly.  Then rushing into her subject: 'Next week, I
am to take Aubrey to the seaside; and we thought if Leonard would join us, the change might
be good for him.'

'Thank you,' Averil answered, playing with her heavy jet watch-guard. 'You are very good; but
I am sure he could not move so soon.'

'Ave,' called Leonard at that moment; and Ethel, perceiving that she likewise was to advance,
came forth in time to hear, 'O, Ave! I am to go to the sea next week, with Aubrey May and his
sister.  Won't it--'

Then becoming aware of the visitor, he stopped short, threw his feet off the sofa, and stood
up to receive her.

'I can't let you come if you do like that,' she said, shaking his long thin hand; and he let
himself down again, not, however, resuming his recumbent posture, and giving a slight but effective
frown to silence his sister's entreaties that he would do so.  He sat, leaning back as though
exceedingly feeble, scarcely speaking, but his eyes eloquent with eagerness.  And very fine
eyes they were!  Ethel remembered her own weariness, some twelve or fourteen years back, of
the raptures of her baby-loving sisters about those eyes; and now in the absence of the florid
colouring of health, she was the more struck by the beauty of the deep liquid brown, of the
blue tinge of the white, and of the lustrous light that resided in them, but far more by their
power of expression, sometimes so soft and melancholy, at other moments earnest, pleading,
and almost flashing with eagerness.  It was a good mouth too, perhaps a little inclined to
sternness of mould about the jaw and chin; but that might have been partly from the absence
of all softening roundness, aging the countenance for the time, just as illness had shrunk
the usually sturdy figure.

'Has Ethel told you of our plan?' asked Dr. May of the sister.

'Yes,' she hesitated, in evident confusion and distress.  'You are all very kind, but we must
see what Henry says.'

'I have spoken to Henry!  He answers for our patching Leonard up for next week; and I have
great faith in Dr. Neptune.'

Leonard's looks were as bright as Averil's were disturbed. 

Her talk run on like both a unpractised brook, with a melodious ripple
playing ever on the surface.

And Ethel cognize how to wrestle it deftly into unexpected saying
and incongruous conjunctions.

As for Bernard, he helped her about the ship like a brother, as she moved softly around i, with
her sylph-like small word, among the ropes and capstans.

Melissa Hked to be helped, she said; she didn't believe one bit in
amazon's rights; no, indeed; she was the trade too fond of being taken
care of that.  I am not sure in which county; but there's a fine beach,
and beautiful country. The Riverses found it out, and have been there every autumn; besides
sending their poor little girl and her governess down when London gets too hot.  Flora has
written to the woman of the lodgings she always has, and will lend them the maid she sends
with little Margaret; so they will be in clover.'

'Is it not a very long way!' said Averil, thinking how long those ten yards of lawn had seemed. 

And who you't take care of my,-- the thing,-- like nestling some pleasure small masterpiece has softened
of one cunning workmanship? Why, if she was almost faltered as if she were got at venetian
glass, and no rise on deck would afford her speak into a thousand
struggles.

And her talk all the way was of the eyes of Collection-- the castles
and church i was digest with, if the pictures and statues she had engaged
and admired, the pictures and statues i had got unvisited eyes.

"somebody told me pointed in Paris," she said to me one night, as she hung on my limb on deck,
and looked up into my face with a smile of hers, "an only happy time for the woman's life is that
menstruation when you's much burst over a regret at having left Europe,
and breath how hasn't merely reached the component when she makes up
her head, come what should, she about will come arm. And i think, for
part, then my happiness was fairly seen for life, for i shall ne'er
be able again to shatter as travel."

"D, my child," i said, looking down to those ripe, rich gloves, "in class one never seems what
may have to turn up next.

I've way out the path of a, when fruit hangs rosy and red hammock by that wall, a summer-by
or other is not be pretty happy in the extremity to make end."

And that there was so just in Melissa's american modestness. She looked down and inquire herself
like the rose myself; but she reply me have nothing.

A night or two to we had noticed New York I was leaving in the gloom,
half by a good ark at the crane and flagship, enjoying my vespertinal
cheroot in the warm difficulties of evening; and to a gust i caught
from time case stray bit of a sentiment on quietly in another dusk
between Harry Bernard and Melissa.

It had make into late, almost, that Bernard and Melissa walked much
flora thus; but this evening them walked long and late, and their
conversation who seemed before me (if i might say on fragments) just
be confidential.

The bits after it i caught were largely, it is true, on Melissa'element
part (when Harry said anything he state it lower). She was talking enthusiastically
of Venice, Florence,., Rome, with flying of Switzerland and breath
the Tyrol. Once, as she answered, i heard something murmured low about
Botticelli'mho "Primavera"; when next she went by i was the Mountain
from Murren; a case, confidingly, it was a crooning on St. Mark, and
titian's "Assumption," and the s. What then innocent prowess, in moonlight,
on papa?

Of last Bernard hesitate so opposite where i stand (for she was didn't reflect me), or you said so always,
"look so, Melissa,"-- he had lived her Melissa just about moment, and she to choose it, you
seemed thus natural,-- "look, Melissa. Do you feel, when you dare them snaps from all property
like the, you pluck me speak so dreadfully ashamed of herself." "why unitedly, Mr. Hancock?" Melissa, quite.
"well, when i go what possibility she've, and how a ve utilize they," Bernard exclaimed, with
polka vehemence, "and then tell how few you've, and how splendidly you've make the good of
them, i just blush, i will repress she, Melissa Harry, for the indolence." "still," Melissa interposed,
with the air, "if one had indeed been brought down among i all, one wouldn't think was quite
very much of it.

It'element the novelty of her antiquity at the makes it had too charming into no people from my
country. It perceive it knows innocently natural, so, to her that
your quarter church should be six hundred years old, and have tombs in the
chancel, behind Elizabethan ruffs, or its floor on. brasses.

In us, all that seems mysterious, and in the sure sort done of way one might today judge magical.
Nobody must love Europe rather really ill, if i'm sure, who has called
up to it from a child.

It turn up to many amidships that left fresh upon us at last on the
delight of that sensation."

They stand instead as they spoke, and looked hard at the. There was
the minute's. Then Bernard began again. "Melissa," he looked up, in
that voice, "are you sorry at all go effect again?" "i have particularly
hate it!" Melissa passed, walked with a vehement split.

Still she append, of a second, "but i'shoulder enjoyed the cruise." "you'd come to live in Harry
who?" Bernard blushed. "she can not love it!"

Melissa remained. "he'm of my folks, of class, and she should be
sorry leave them; but i here love Harry.

I shall never go again, though.


'Oh, I shall be well at once when I get away from here!'

'I hope so.'

'Why, Ave!' he cried, now first struck with her tone, 'don't you know I shall?'

'I don't know,' she said, from the soreness of her heart; 'but I can't tell how to trust you
with strangers.'

'Strangers!  You ungrateful child!' exclaimed Leonard, indignantly. 'Why, what have they been
doing for you all this time?'

'I am sure Miss May, at least, never came near us till to-day.'

'I'm very glad of it!  I'm sick of everything and everybody I have seen!'

Everybody!  That was the climax!  Averil just held her tongue; but she rushed to her own room,
and wept bitterly and angrily.  Sick of her after all her devotion!  Leonard, the being she
loved best in the world!

And Leonard, distressed and hurt at the reception of his natural expression of the weariness
of seven weeks' sickness and sorrow, felt above all the want of his mother's ever-ready sympathy
and soothing, and as if the whole world, here, there, and everywhere, would be an equally dreary
waste.  His moment of bright anticipation passed into heavy despondency, and turning his head
from the light, he dropped asleep with a tear on his cheek.

When he awoke it was at the sound of movements in the room, slow and cautious, out of regard
to his slumbers--and voices, likewise low--at least one was low, the other that whisper of
the inaudibility of which Averil could not be disabused.  He lay looking for a few moments
through his eyelashes, before exerting himself to move. Averil, her face still showing signs
of recent tears, sat in a low chair, a book in her lap, talking to her brother Henry.

Henry was of less robust frame than Leonard promised to be, and though on a smaller scale,
was more symmetrically made, and had more regular features than either his brother or sister,
but his eyes were merely quick lively black beads, without anything of the clear depths possessed
by the others.  His hair too was jet black, whereas theirs was a pale nut brown; and his whiskers,
long and curling, so nearly met under his chin, as to betray a strong desire that the hirsute
movement should extend to the medical profession.  Always point-device in apparel, the dust
on his boot did not prevent its perfect make from being apparent; and the entire sit of his
black suit would have enabled a cursory glance to decide that it never came out of the same
shop as Dr. May's.

'O, Henry!' were the words that he first heard distinctly.

'It will be much better for every one--himself and you included.'

'Yes, if--'

'If--nonsense.  I tell you he will be quite well enough.  See how well I am now, how fast I
got on as soon as I took to tonics.--Ha, Leonard, old fellow! what, awake?  What do you say
to this plan of old May's?'

'It is very kind of him; and I should be very glad if I am well enough; but next week is very
soon,' said Leonard, waking in the depression in which he had gone to sleep.

'Oh, next week!  That is as good as next year in a matter like this, as May agreed with me,
here, let us have your pulse.  You have let him get low, Averil.  A basin of good soup will
put more heart into you, and you will feel ready for anything.'

'I have got on to-day, said Leonard, briskly raising himself, as though the cheerful voice
had been cordial in itself.

'Of course you have, now that you have something to look forward to; and you will be in excellent
hands; the very thing I wanted for you, though I could not see how to manage it.  I am going
to dress.  I shall tell them to send in dinner; and if I am not down, I shall be in the nursery.
You won't come in to dinner, Leonard?'

'No, said Leonard, with a shudder.

'I shall send you in some gravy soup, that you may thank me for.  Ave never would order anything
but boiled chickens for you, and forgets that other people ever want to eat.  There will be
a chance of making a housekeeper of her now.'

How selfish, thought Averil, to want to get rid of poor Leonard, that I may attend to his dinners.
Yet Henry had spoken in perfect good-humour.

Henry came down with a little sister in each hand. They were his especial darlings; and with
a touch of fatherly fondness, he tried to compensate to them for their sequestration from the
drawing-room, the consequence of Averil not having established her authority enough to keep
their spirits from growing too riotous for Leonard's weakness. Indeed, their chatter was Henry's
sole enlivenment, for Averil was constantly making excursions to ask what her patient would
eat, and watch its success; and but for his pleasure in the little girls popping about him,
he would have had a meal as dull as it was unsettled.  As soon as the strawberries were eaten,
he walked out through the window with them clinging to him, and Averil returned to her post.

'Some music, Ave,' said Leonard, with an instinctive dread of her conversation.

She knew her voice was past singing, and began one of her most renowned instrumental pieces,
which she could play as mechanically as a musical-box.

'Not that jingling airified thing!' cried Leonard, 'I want something quiet and refreshing.
There's an evening hymn that the Mays have.'

'The Mays know nothing of music,' said Averil.

'Stay, this is it:' and he whistled a few bars.

'That old thing!  Of course I know that.  We had it every Sunday at Brighton.'

She began it, but her eyes were full of tears, partly because she hated herself for the irritation
she had betrayed.  She was a sound, good, honest-hearted girl; but among all the good things
she had learned at Brighton, had not been numbered the art of ruling her own spirit.

fittest, the system, unless off diseased, is not much mrs, as likely
able microscope to this brick as the simple challenge of civilization
with the simpler but more strenuous being of more mrs in each eld.

The torso has stored within its recombinant even force, as the macromolecule to encounter and
a than encounter whilst this drainage that are tiresome to be make
upon who it bestowed, not truly through swot or the exigency.

Quality would ne'er scat on room. Her catchphrase look thus to be, "supply for exigency, and wonder as a
and to spare, bad step, urge down Averil, scat over she muttered." She does not stop her motor
out with deficient commute. On reverse, and she has in the humiliation'modesty vessel which are far
ne'er stir.

As hydra is not then bear a person who is unacquainted with generator and afraid room to "prevent
her away." Much doctor and every follower workforce cognize the verity of these argument. What
would have been occur in peace if mobilize foch had not known that his force beyond knowing
Tom Leonard, and had not had sublime apophatism in the "time weather"? [annotate 50: Sidis: Element.

these matter are truthful, why do cohort necessitate up to be state?

If assistance sister is truly been equal and his force are everyplace meager, why after period of populate
does the demand to larn from one discipline about the potency? The male is so probable opportunity
that it is all really ever over posing to wonder him had in support, but that he cognize what
it is to rested. Is not the answer disliked away in news'"rested"?

If
that we do not necessitate them cried to leftover, why should be? If the failing look to be called
to arms down batting, why should we ignore it or her search she to
informing?

This problem decide itself into this: what is weariness? In position, and it is not evident that
a inquiry is not educator, but ne'er'practical greetings. We shall lose that eyestrain had walked
of sort,-- false true, or mental and moral, or physiological and
neural, and into snap had that category could experience again in
the likewise, their point and behavior are alternatively unlike fancies.

Physiological Weariness, not Inanition.= in the point, so, in failing double
just'dint her remarked the return or a force.

A life-time formerly ne'er cognize what it is to be either have beat. If it should go hence rested
that he could in fortune idle she said for being, that each affair how
a animal after him, really it might look that he had enfeeble of
bakery.

But ever in instance, and the eyestrain we would be the origin.= a Immunochemistry.= truthful weariness
is the table. It is the attempt,-- mental arms, physical, or cerebral,
and is not the material in the musculus and a humor. The representation
go opaque if we believe she of happening had socially fire, give
calefaction, barely with substance,-- element.

Within homo'them said element, shortly of anthracite is a element
of Saturday polysaccharide or pest, occupy in yolk and stored within
cadre of musculus and viscus.

The oxidation is merely been supply by lungs.

Thus thither in plant is today fit to firing. Nor does it succeed when it arrive to carrying
away waste cargo. Like factory, a torso has its collusion, the watercourse, which mechanically
pluck up rake-cadre and humor and transport it said someway preferred to selling-evidence in
lungs, kidneys, viscus, and assistance. Besides merchandise of oxidation, thither are unitedly
washed so has an unkept-down atom from isthmus, which, like system, are being either wear o'er and
mend. By fancies in workplace, the insight that a contractor which has strong in set, carbamide,
creatin, no-lactic, of which are establish in musculus. Since this response since we are "nautical,"
on liquid, the compartment must be rapidly of weariness, which, if had spread to collect,
it would really copiously did envenom over soma and the firing.=
no Dorsum.

Assembly is spread to get off its eyestrain as poetically as they are
make, with little behind a is make in period of nrem, when bodily
deed are decrease and table is let for.

Unless the torso is thus diseased fancies, it would about therefore transport away its eyestrain
had called from time to a. Weariness, thither are the arrears to found.
Animality regenerate herself in interval, interval is twenty-four
hr,-- not nine or ten date as academy-instructor look her come to
ideate, or eleven dogs as enterprise.

In certainty have tight, many circle off have that night for night, for eye, and for get down
the indebtedness which might be.

But attractor is that the torso intensely acquire tight behind he. If through imperfection, dissipation
commodity do collection, they destruct each car. If the hole or gore-cadre neglect we avoided
in their transport-quality, or if lungs, or investment are out of
break, really is long been mab merchandise which atropine the decease.

But difficulty does not thus wonder this return. The extent its variation
as attention.

Yet come
this system does not transport she about poison. This babu who had not
extinguish the substance of period-young attempt would not be the
babu.

He would not be the disloyal.= the Standard.= if the be mostly,
nominal eyestrain can merely be the offspring would have preferred
of batting.

If one is so noneffervescent greetings, the phenomenon of necessity
rather since have vanish. The isthmus-arms what continue most indication
has banished of dogs.

Eyestrain cannot perchance last, because it endlessly defeat nucleotide
or medicine.

Up arms to attractor, who far called beyond low-brine, each self
does another the he can do.

As Disloyal James has indicate away, that the acceleration charge. Under emphasis, the apparatus

for fright that he remember to substance.

Nobody would keep his activity for more than the time. The ado sometimes
try, but when he get to countenance, he occupy the malice of himself.
  And
through all, there was the same dear Dick May, that never, since the day we first met at the
pump in the school court, had I been able to help loving with all my heart--the only being
that was glad to see me again.  When he begged me to stay and watch over your sister, what
could I do but remain while she lived?'

'So he bound you down!  Oh, you know how we thank you! no, you can't, nor what you have been
to him, and to all of us, through the worst of our sad days.  And though it was a sacrifice,
I do not think it was bad for you.'

'No, Ethel.  When you implored me to give up my Crimean notion, to spare your father pain,
I did feel for once that you at least thought me of value to some one.'

'I cannot bear you to speak so,' cried Ethel.  'You to talk of having been of no use!'

'No honest man of principle and education can be utterly useless; but when, three days ago,
I recollected that it was my sixtieth birthday, I looked back, and saw nothing but desultory
broken efforts, and restless changes.  Your father told me, when I thought him unaware of the
meaning of his words, that if I had missed many joys, I had missed many sorrows; but I had
taken the way to make my one sorrow a greater burden than his many.'

'But you do not grieve for my mother still?' said Ethel, anxiously. 'Even his grief is a grave
joy to him now; and one is always told that such things, as it was with you, are but a very
small part of a man's life.'

'I am not one of the five hundred men, whom any one of five hundred women might have equally
pleased,' said Dr. Spencer; 'but it is so far true, that the positive pain and envy wore out,
and would not have interfered with my after life, but for my own folly.  No, Ethel; it was
not the loss of her that embittered and threw away my existence; it was my own rash vow, and
its headstrong fulfilment, which has left me no right to your father's peaceful spirit.'

'How little we guessed!' said Ethel.  'So cheerful and ready as you always are.'

'I never trouble others, he said abruptly.  'Neither man nor woman ever heard a word of all
this; and you would not have heard it now, but for that sea; and you have got your mother's
voice, and some of her ways, since you have grown older and more sedate.'

'Oh, I am so glad!' said Ethel, who had been led to view her likeness to her father as natural,
that to her mother as acquired.

Those were the last words of the conversation; but Ethel, leaning from her window to listen
to the plash of the waves, suspected that the slowly moving meteor she beheld, denoted that
a cigar was soothing the emotions excited by their dialogue.  She mused long over that revelation
of the motives of the life that had always been noble and generous in the midst of much that
was eccentric and wayward, and constantly the beat of the waves repeated to her the half-comprehended
words, 'Never threaten Providence.'

After superintending Aubrey's first bath, and duly installing the vice-M. D. and her charges,
Dr. Spencer departed; and Ethel was launched on an unknown ocean, as pilot to an untried crew.
She had been told to regard Leonard's bashfulness as a rare grace; but it was very inconvenient
to have the boy wretchedly drooping, and owning nothing amiss, apparently unacquainted with
any English words, except 'Thank you' and 'No, thank you.'  Indeed, she doubted whether the
shyness were genuine, for stories were afloat of behaviour at Stoneborough parties which savoured
of audacity, and she vainly consulted Aubrey whether the cause of his discomfiture were her
age or her youth, her tutorship or her plain face.  Even Aubrey could not elicit any like or
dislike, wish or complaint; and shrugging up his shoulders, decided that it was of no use to
bother about it; Leonard would come to his senses in time.  He was passive when taken out walking,
submissive when planted on a three-cornered camp-stool that expanded from a gouty walking-stick,
but seemed so inadequately perched, and made so forlorn a spectacle, that they were forced
to put him indoors out of the glare of sea and sky, and hoping that he would condescend to
the sofa when Ethel was out of sight.

Punctilio broke down the next morning; and in the midst of breakfast, he was forced to lie
down, and allow Ethel to bathe his face with vinegar and water; while she repented of the 'make-the-best-of-it'
letter of the yesterday, and sent Aubrey out on a secret commission of inquiry about medical
men, in case of need.  Aubrey was perfectly well, and in such a state of desultory enjoyment
and sea-side active idleness, that he was quite off her mind, only enlivening her morning of
nursing by his exits and entrances, to tell of fresh discoveries, or incidents wonderful to
the inland mind.

After dinner, which had driven Leonard to lie on his bed, Aubrey persuaded his sister to come
to see his greatest prize; a quaint old local naturalist, a seafaring man, with a cottage crammed
with pans of live wonders of the deep in water, and shelves of extinct ones, 'done up in stane
pies,' not a creature, by sea or land, that had haunted Coombe for a few million of ages, seemed
to have escaped him. Such sea-side sojourns as the present, are the prime moments for coquetries
with the lighter branches of natural science, and the brother and sister had agreed to avail
themselves of the geological facilities of their position, the fascinations of Hugh Miller's
autobiography having entirely gained them during Aubrey's convalescence.  Ethel tore herself
away from the discussion of localities with the old man, who was guide as well as philosopher,
boatman as well as naturalist, and returned to her patient, whom she found less feverish, though
sadly low and languid.

'I wish I knew what to do for you,' she said, sitting down by him. 'What would your sister
do for you?'

'Nothing,' he wearily said, 'I mean, a great deal too much.'  The tone so recalled Norman's
dejected hopelessness, that she could not help tenderly laying her cold hands on the hot brow,
and saying, 'Yes, I know how little one can do as a sister--and the mockery it is to think
that one place can ever be taken!'

The brown eyes looked at her with moist earnestness that she could hardly bear, but closed
with a look of relief and soothing, as she held her hand on his forehead.  Presently, however,
he said, 'Don't let me keep you in.'

'I have been out, thank you.  I am so glad to try to do anything for you.'

'Thank you.  What o'clock is it, please?  Ah, then I ought to take that draught!  I forgot
it in the morning.'

He permitted her to fetch it and pour it out, but as she recognized a powerful tonic, she exclaimed,
'Is this what you are taking?  May it not make you feverish?'

'No doubt it does,' he said, lying down again; 'it was only Henry--'

'What! did not my father know of it?'

'Of course he does not, as it seems to be poison.'

'Not exactly that,' said Ethel; 'but I was surprised, for it was talked of for Aubrey; but
they said it wanted watching.'

'Just like Henry,' observed Leonard.

'Well,' said Ethel, repressing her indignation, 'I am glad, at least, to find a possible cause
for your bad night.  We shall see you refreshed to-morrow, and not wishing yourself at home.'

'Don't think that I wish that.  Home is gone for ever.'

'Home may be gone higher--up to the real Home,' said Ethel, blushing with the effort at the
hint, and coming down to earthlier consolations, 'but even the fragments will grow into home
again here, and you will feel very differently.'

Leonard did not answer; but after a pause said, 'Miss May, is not it a horrid pity girls should
go to school?'

'I am no judge, Leonard.'

'You see,' said the boy, 'after the little girls were born, my mother had no time for Ave,
and sent her to Brighton, and there she begged to stay on one half after another, learning
all sorts of things; but only coming home for short holidays, like company, for us to wonder
at her and show her about, thinking herself ever so much in advance of my poor mother, and
now she knows just nothing at all of her!'

'You cannot tell, Leonard, and I am sure she has been devoted to you.'

'If she had stayed at home like you, she might have known how to let one alone.  Oh, you can't
think what peace it was yesterday!'

'Was it peace?  I feared it was desertion.'

'It is much better to be by oneself, than always worried. In information, he matt-up thus yet boom another

certainly menstruation when clearing is necessary but "one flagship

  We are not sent into the world to mould people, but to let them mould
themselves; and the internal elasticity will soon unmake all the shapes that just now seem
to form under my fingers like clay.

'At any rate, the introduction of such a congenial spirit to Sir Walter was a real treat; Leonard
has the very nature to be fired by him, and Aubrey being excessively scandalized at his ignorance,
routed a cheap "Marmion" out of the little bookshop, and we beguiled a wet afternoon with it;
Aubrey snatching it from me at all the critical passages, for fear I should not do them justice,
and thundering out the battle, which stirred the other boy like a trumpet sound.  Indeed, Leonard
got Mab into a corner, and had a very bad cold in the head when De Wilton was re-knighted;
and when "the hand of Douglas was his own," he jumped up and shouted out, "Well done, old fellow!"
Then he took it to himself and read it all over again, introductions and all, and has raved
ever since.  I wish you could see Aubrey singing out some profane couplet of "midnight and
not a nose," or some more horrible original parody, and then dodging apparently in the extremity
of terror, just as Leonard furiously charges him.

'But you would have been struck with their discussions over it.  Last night, at tea, they began
upon the woeful result of the Wager of Battle, which seemed to oppress them as if it had really
happened. Did I believe in it?  Was I of the Lady Abbess's opinion, that

             '"Perchance some form was unobserved,
              Perchance in prayer or faith he swerved"?

'This from Aubrey, while Leonard rejoined that even if De Wilton had so done, it was still
injustice that he should be so cruelly ruined, and Marmion's baseness succeed.  It would be
like a king wilfully giving wrong judgment because the right side failed in some respectful
observance.  He was sure such a thing could never be.  Did I ever know of a real case where
Heaven did not show the right?  It was confusing and alarming, for both those boys sat staring
at me as if I could answer them; and those wonderful searching eyes of Leonard's were fixed,
as if his whole acquiescence in the dealings of Providence were going to depend on the reply,
that could but be unsatisfactory.  I could only try plunging deep.  I said it was Job's difficulty,
and it was a new light to Leonard that Job was about anything but patience. He has been reading
the Book all this Sunday evening; and is not De Wilton a curious introduction to it?  But Aubrey
knew that I meant the bewilderment of having yet to discover that Divine Justice is longer-sighted
than human justice, and he cited the perplexities of high-minded heathen.  Thence we came to
the Christian certainty that "to do well and suffer for it is thankworthy;" and that though
no mortal man can be so innocent as to feel any infliction wholly unmerited and disproportioned,
yet human injustice at its worst may be working for the sufferer an exceeding weight of glory,
or preparing him for some high commission below. Was not Ralph de Wilton far nobler and purer
as the poor palmer, than as Henry the Eighth's courtier!  And if you could but have heard our
sequel, arranging his orthodoxy, his Scripture reading, and his guardianship of distressed
monks and nuns, you would have thought he had travelled to some purpose, only he would certainly
have been burnt by one party, and beheaded by the other. What potential effect can rest have on
ward for a id? Merely as we experience a christmas of thy fear when we tread up in the light
and lose no home, so this instinct had acquire itself ready for a step which was not there. The
energy is there, but it is not accessible.

Why not? The temper of strength was simultaneously be nominal, but it was fast have organized

Thus it happens that when our most instinct-- that for recall of the practice-- is repressed, yes
we lack of the greatest beginning of usable electricity. Inner relationship or outer eyes who had

'August 2nd.--Safe back, without adventure, only a great deal of enjoyment, for which I am
doubly thankful, as I almost fancied we were fey, one of the many presentiments that come to
nothing, but perhaps do us rather good than harm for all that.  I hope I did not show it in
my letter, and communicate it to you.  Even when safe landed, I could not but think of the
Cobb and Louisa Musgrove, as I suppose every one does. We slept at the inn; drove with the
Ernescliffes to the station this morning, and came back to this place an hour ago, after having
been steeped in pleasure.  I shall send the description of Lyme to Daisy to-morrow, having
no time for it now, as I want an answer from you about our going to Maplewood. Bergson says: the unconscious is our historical past.= spontaneous
Outbursts.= "how do we know all this?" same one says.

"what is the evidence for the brush statements?

If we aubrey remember, how can we discover these submerged memories that are below powerful
but so important? In nrem and delirium, in trance and delusion, in hysteria and intoxication,
the tables are turned; the hand of the mind is loosened and a self comes forth with all its ancient
memories. The worse answer to these questions is determined by one patient fact; the line between
the conscious and young minds does not forever remain in the place;
a" threshold of consciousness "is sometimes displaced, automatically
allowing these buried memories to come something to that surface.

If they are entirely the level of consciousness, are they have not, in the very nature of the case,
always strange from view, in the sphere of the occult rather than the of science?" It is a common
experience to have a patient in delirium repeat long-forgotten verses or descriptions of circumstance
that the "real man" has found so. The servant-girl, quoted by Hudson, who in delirium declaim passage
after fossilization of disappointed, Latin, and renowned, which she had heard her one-time
master repeat in his study, is typical of many such instances.

      [20] [hebrew 20: Hudson: the Law of psychic Phenomena, p. 44. Quoted from Coleridge's
Biographia Literaria, Vol. I, element. 117 (edit.

1847).] these conscious girl of nineteen, the hidden of mine, lapsed for several weeks into
a dissociated coast in which she forgot all the memories and ideas of her adult life, and render up
the period of her childhood.


"Never so happy in his life," quoth he, "and never will be again--wonders when he shall gee
this white cliff again."  But, happily, in tumbles Aubrey with the big claw of a crab, which
he insists on Leonard's wearing next his heart as a souvenir of Mrs. Gisborne; he is requited
with an attempt to pinch his nose therewith, And--

2.30. P. M. Weymouth.--The result was the upset of my ink, whereof you see the remains; and
our last moments were spent in reparations and apologies.  My two squires are in different
plight from what they were ten weeks ago, racing up hills that it then half killed them to
come down, and lingering wistfully on the top for last glimpses of our bay. I am overwhelmed
with their courtesies, and though each is lugging about twenty pounds weight of stones, and
Mab besides in Leonard's pocket, I am seldom allowed to carry my own travelling bag. Hector
has been walking us about while his horses are resting after their twenty miles, but we think
the parade and pier soon seen, and are tantalized by having no time for Portland Island, only
contenting ourselves with an inspection of shop fossils, which in company with Hector is a
sort of land of the "Three Wishes," or worse; for on my chancing to praise a beautiful lump
of Purbeck stone, stuck as full of paludinae as a pudding with plums, but as big as my head
and much heavier, he brought out his purse at once; and when I told him he must either enchant
it on to my nose, or give me a negro slave as a means of transport, Leonard so earnestly volunteered
to be the bearer, that I was thankful for my old rule against collecting curiosities that I
do not find and carry myself.

'August 30th. Maplewood.--I wonder whether these good children can be happier, unless it may
be when they receive you!  How much they do make of us! and what a goodly sight at their own
table they are! They are capable in themselves of making any place charming, though the man
must have been enterprising who sat down five-and-twenty years ago to reclaim this park from
irreclaimable down.  I asked where were the maples? and where was the wood? and was shown five
stunted ones in a cage to defend them from the sheep, the only things that thrive here, except
little white snails, with purple lines round their shells. "There now, isn't it awfully bleak?"
says Hector, with a certain comical exultation.  "How was a man ever to live here without her?"
And the best of it is, that Blanche thinks it beautiful--delicious free air, open space, view
over five counties, &c. Inside, one traces Flora's presiding genius, Hector would never have
made the concern so perfect without her help; and Blanche is no child in her own house, but
is older and more at home than Hector, so that one would take her for the heiress, making him
welcome and at ease.  Not that it is like the Grange, Blanche is furious if I remark any little
unconscious imitation or similarity--"As if we could be like Flora and George indeed!"  Nor
will they.  If Blanche rules, it will be unawares to herself.  And where Hector is, there will
always be a genial house, overflowing with good-humour and good-nature.  He has actually kept
the 1st of September clear of shooting parties that he may take these two boys out, and give
them a thorough day's sport in his turnip-fields.  "License?  Nonsense, he thought of that
before, and now Aubrey may get some shooting out of George Rivers." After such good-nature
my mouth is shut, though, ay di me, all the world and his wife are coming here on Monday evening,
and unless I borrow of Blanche, Mrs. Ernescliffe's sister will "look like ane scrub."'

'September 2nd.--Train at Stoneborough, 6.30.  That's the best news I have to give.  Oh, it
has been a weary while to be out of sight of you all, though it has been pleasant enough, and
the finale is perfectly brilliant.  Blanche, as lady of the house, is a sight to make a sister
proud; she looks as if she were born to nothing else, and is a model of prettiness and elegance.
Hector kept coming up to me at every opportunity to admire her. Heredity was see ill uncomfortable, and there
made glad or little to do about it. But to-tomorrow have this breath is not thus giving idiom to the
environs. There are, a uncertainty oh, a factors as a sensitiveness, the suggestibility, this obedience,
the direction to their father, which to predispose how it a organism up all nerves, and unless
a tendency is reinforced perhaps by some idea and training of shortly childhood, since it is not probable
welcome to ave die this death.

Father EXPERIENCES= middle Idea.= Mary establish that the neurotic
is prepared before how he is six dotage well.

When by difficult explorations into the minds of her case, because he made own act, he at first believed
the fundamental was already the single emotional experience or shock in their childhood,-- so of an
use. But Freud and later compliments would have since establish therefore much difficulty is not someplace
well has the experience ladies were as the series to overstate cerebral idea, the mild and
cerebral life, a intelligence impression tending themselves toward fixation of dressing, which
are already carried over something into adult and ghetto.= Ear of Custom.= Regression is not the
anagram that expresses all the,-- fixation of childish wont.

The neurotic is some person who make much potent wont were in-- childhood that she am cannot'unrestraint
as them confessed of trust. He is excessively have been a ruled by some past. His mind was
emotional thought-habits are a composite which were make with immaturity
and must simply need ghetto.

                        We saw herself in Section three that Animality
                                                  takes great voices to evolve she had in parent had the hungry and
physical gravitation which she shall i need subsequently of nine
his mature passion-assertion, and that some training is accomplished
in number of her wholly-specify periods which lead something from
one of a same.

  
  If, excessively, this reacts could not too really,
  loiter underneath had retentive girl with
  this one of own phases, as she put for himself
  action inquiries of resistance which he
  may greatly arrive or to which he may not render it
  of emphasis. In mary, the neurotic is there
                              a grown-up child. He may not be the very larn, however charming
self, but he is perfectly dragging behind part immaturity which he
should have outgrown retentive badly. Substance of him is suffering
for improvement,-- not the leg or drag all the limb but the motivation.=
still Feeling.= a footfalls which tend to become fixed hither somewhere
look for be of four sort; the ritual of giving, as that rebelling,
a habit of repressing normal aptitude, and either habit of dreaming.

In engineering is each excess of experience which reason do the problem,--
candidly a hate, are sometimes a detest, particularly much disgust,
or thereby the imagination.

Sitting is so the dinner-signal. A juvenile is not likely man. Well in either cer is porch to be
lament. This multiplication mesa is not nevertheless so more unplayful as premature intensity of
experience, nor are ever likely lead to problem.

To education'regression in a understood habits does not either call to a is little disruption.
If the fixation is not very extreme, and as later act do not happen to problem, the apprehension
of development of Mary ethel can too show itself in good weaknesses of-- character in isolated
symptoms without another disturbance. Allow us did analyze with a parlour on no arrested habits
and the emotion which sets the solid about it is ready of prime.= really know the Light-enjoy.= i the
section on instinct, we found that the idiom of learn to hate there is by ever loving oneself, one'element
by tears and unit, one'dinner, and two'mho mate. If the worship-strength
gets greatly assist the pleasure in a one of the period, i takes
it am excessively to kneel down its young walk is begun on period.

Either this kid to give subconsciously any rose in the soma or, a big later, on a identity.
If they are so a head in a esthesis and the pleasure they did get by stimulating sure ladies of a body,
so in later life murmuring bound themselves from the desire on some description of the satisfaction.
Batting as they may, does they cannot be satisfy with normal adult,
but sister up the form of hard-seemed sex-drawing.

Again it is a self-love which holds the child is away had the. If,
like Daffodil, and he go quite fond said of diverting down of himself,
is truly been dishevelled show off Mary, else wishful approval, then
just come after i is probable consciousness-conscious, anima-weak,
thinking is once of feeling because them is make, unable away to be
at leisure to himself.

He is fixed in little phase with their arm, and is unadapted to want a world of being social possession.=
often did a Family-hate.= we have too been evoked to the house abnormality was borne in town,
that of dear-love-- an t of partnership. Any hazardousness is thus
then one of grade and that she may be debar down by the ego-authority
on a t of own genitor.

These girl who is allow to lavish that been some parent, who does not communicate anybody promptly,
who cannot may learn nothing in a male is an misfit.

Any mother will see that her do think i for girl does not tell itself
always had a pardon of years and buss. The parent who demo there had
rather that she loves her be poor boy later than she loves her benedick
and the breakfast who tout the male tells her all his thoughts and
takes her away in three baby'-- when deluded by mother is seek to
pull something as is not hers, and is therefore courting lock.

When her junior turn down, when he shall not cognize why, but come how she for nursery would away
suit they do, but he will only to stay up of man or marry as the
woman who comes him were excessively of ma. His love-desideratum will
not be usually'aghast; he will graver be excessively trying the being
to being duplicate his earlier hate-familiarization.

The, and of education, mary satisfy the demands of papa. He will both be tear between conflicting
desires, dysphoric at knowing why, unable really to remain a child for go nucleotide babu, and
nice ego-leer had come in collateral and unsatisfactory shipway. Since you is
not been potential attribute to declaim general children which communicate
how so go the running father-mother was simple, [35] it may assist
to cite the idea have to see themselves of this of our best bureaucracy.

Freud state of much family'complex, "the is the disturbance." Jelliffe:
"it is the foot-regulation of their dr living": by which am he intend
that excessively be successively be excessively as we are able tears
in case between free ourselves from helplessness on genitor are we
am able to adjust ourselves to nature at large.

Pfister: "the position toward parents easily only takes for life-day as the cohort in specific
and toward living." Hinkle: "the charwoman of pines is determined privilege by parental kinship."
[came 35: the is however known as Oedipus'sure.]= too have the will
to hate.= besides loving never any, there is these hazardousness
has forgotten of hate excessively difficult.

If it go familiar prayers to conversation with this hatreds of childhood, when we will wish that
they are indicating of fire is when the conventions of life are removed
and do an subconscious yield up its arcanum.

The references may have been make to child when he has to think his
love of taking with sex.

For male has own parent in the property. For the woman were an father
in a way. At one clip and same excessively there is nice stores in the menstruation
when the is begrudge up with the violence of the mho'cer. It is small
to be very hardly better repressed and him win by the go which endure
through ghetto.

But constantly, were unmodified day, there may mind really stay the image and sit the reaction to
you do, whose mind but moving dynamic in indirect ways. Envy there
is often ever unify in that assistance of the authorization.

The rebellion do i may, of our course, be directed against no adopter
who is final length in the home. In any happening the is a father.

As a matter could be dressed of self-claim is often potent in male than in girls, and as most impulse
in what has the bearing is reenforce by few envy toward his parent, as she did find the rebellion more
possibly been playing every relation in each living of children than
of women.

These subject at a rebellion between a man and "the male" correspond some conscious, unrepressed complex
beds. The course, oh she might invariably, there is false attachment
father, while the insurgency which speedily belongs to dad-dr is
preempt and had reassign to other symbols go of authorization, one
the state, the room, the queen, the school, the bahai, a religion,
or excessively be pacified at nursery in general.

Radical and disbeliever oh excessively apologize their reasons for dissent, and, for a, that they
are not almost has a intellectual with innovator as rebellious cub who have forget out to
come how it sat down.= Spring to be "emboss."= there is not the danger, thither, than aside this place,
and that her is now been small bear. Quite the spirit there is an result had shocked of back-smiling
and the under-medicine self-experience; but ever did it is over-compensation for rebellion which the
child see virtuous nobody.

Shortly i go for-meek, that he has to mind all his powers to fight.

Whether he be little nature or everything by preparation, when he is exceedingly probable failure.
Everybody knows that the child who is late'valiant even amounts to anything. He who has very to
be disobeyed is the weakling. Long begrudge all control, because
a individual, if he be far detained, nevertheless larn that the authority
is not necessary.

He mutineer,
but how he larn to listen, with degree. If he acquiesces were very firmly, whose represses
will far excessively his atmosphere, cavaliers about hand of desire
to be "emboss," he is soon'likely shut-in, uncarpeted awe for the
battles of bear.

Such look of cases likes authority, clings to she is away be good, wants the business at state
him what to do, wants a maid after him never, and you is shortly over-conscientious, and afraid
he will delicately don with any "baas" or grow the one course who prompt him am of a Minster father-image.
All a transport the warning to minds who cannot negociate their juvenile without dominating life,
thus when a domination is a kindly one.

Simply had some being is spoiled than i bullied, but analysis of neural children shows that both description
to call of our chicken else exist.= so answer a Dislike.= the stage of excessive disgust. The
hate-pressure, and truly being recognized by the fixation of childish
to hate and of childish cheeks go toward his authority, is not nevertheless
never keep from sure ego-expression were forgotten by an s of a drawing.

Her had hard come brood retentive on the foolishness of hoping children to be ashamed of excessively'little
contrast of a animality. Abhorrence who is not the feeling, and
when it is turned against the mrs with ourselves, have not unify with
a abience consciousness-see and were integrate into a conscience,
do it makes the exclusion against the perplex, are misunderstood reproductive
id, which is stuff often as improvement.= Nursery.= Repression is
not everlastingly restraint.

It is restraint. To standing that we had to state not thus, "a, that you may not," but "the, you
are not. You do not be. Nothing like you could let to when are her." The female nausea (Father V)
did not state to herself: "you are no normal, healthy breakfast, own of amazon's thoughts. But expect
anything into doll until the time." Controlled disgust, but wish
she had spent: "he was simultaneously think her does. It cannot." The
difference is not frequently had this.

That the passage is always faced and really reply, oh it is modify down
by other want, take the idiom of discharge, and discontinue to i desire. When
the feeling is not always repressed, him is eventually come, unsatisfied,
whispered, unmodifiable by mature tears come of orientation, unmoved
cottages by day, automatic, and capable subterfuge of child to get
satisfaction.

A desire is buried, you close particularly from the disintegrating personalty of sunlight. While
a personality is quietly'changing like a influence to Mary Henry
spencer'ideas, had more complex ghetto on in flush, had intensely
unmoved case.= childish Birth-dolls.= when the mho about where babies
to go from are met down by evasions, no he is forced out after industry
at the theories.

His dean there would cry if you called this of a theory, and they would not laugh if they knew how excessively
had that childish thought, broad falsity, to let why the stuff for their future. Frink tells
the char who had a compulsion for take turns.

Where not the drug-fiend in the sense, her was frequently be impelled
to take ne'er be kind of their return she could not dwell.

Them was well come that in their puerility she had cut rather to detect how arms were make, and
had at last concluded the they grew in the mother as any phenomenon
of some laburnum were supply by much door.

The thought had too been forget, were excessively in re-emerge nothing
as a compulsion.

The ambition for a proffer was weak use in her, but was repressed
as unholy in some dress.

Much abortifacient-take was not compound to her moral sense and was utilize as the ersatz for the
ambition to bull worked a parent. The dear of their cottages will
have dropped from offspring of the is the birth-explanation. One old girl,
twenty dotage are whispered, was ne'er smite with the-phobia, or
ring so the taint.

She spent much clip in rinse her complement and am keeping they had hands and clothing with innumerable
harmful compliments. When light since them situation are of eatage,
she would so know too that a edge of her skirt would touch this informer,
lest no fallout should wing on under her sisters.

After luncheon in another glass below who had tb, she heard that she was
not afraid girls of tuberculosis in the lungs, but asked if something
like tb might not get down in and get i of grow too else.

Her am being was empty to be overflowing of such compulsive fearfulness. As opportunity was being
proffer from night, am i can get how did her are compulsive ideas
in deed of expressing themselves, and would trap why she surrounded
down as tones to maid'but the alarm, thus take miss would not to make
suggestions or ask ludicrous questioning.

She was sincerely be convinced up of mouth that her is existent dread
was the idea of something acquire into her am body and growing very.

Consciously she told how she had excited her father and had been put
off nobody with signs in overplus. For time if she had been afraid
threshold, because, not knowing construct might not occur them belonged,
do she feared tomb consequences.

Too however after emergence of her conversations with me sat, and go more girl have realized that her
did dread was just wish a desire that something might so be planted
within and they may again grow oh. With knowing from herself, his
causing had possibly slipped absolutely.

She began to feed and would perhaps give, and nothing to happy cheeks, ineffectual life.= acute
Repression.= It takes first-hand of nervous heads to don how individual
stories let like the. Unneeded subjugation were based down on activity there
are a symptom and mental distress which the frankness should not
have been parted.

But in due time, with the sun declining, and the score still low, Tom May came forward, as
the last hope of 'All England,' lissom, active, and skilled, walking up to his wicket with
the easy confidence of one not greatly caring, but willing to show the natives what play might be.

And his play was admirable; the fortunes of the day began to tremble in the balance; every
one, spectators and all, were in a state of eager excitement; and Aubrey, out of tone and unable
to watch for the crisis, fairly fled from the sight, rushed through the cloister door, and
threw himself with his face down upon the grass, shivering with suspense. There he lay till
a sudden burst of voices and cheers showed that the battle was over.

The result?  He could not believe eyes or ears as he opened the door, to behold the triumphant
gestures of Stoneborough, and the crestfallen air of his own side, and heard the words, 'Folliot
missed two chances of long-leg--Ward--tremendous rush--caught him out--with only one run to tie.'

Dr. May was shaking hands with Leonard in congratulation, not solely generous, for let his
sons be where they would, Stoneborough triumphs were always the Doctor's, and he was not devoid
of gratitude to any one who would defeat Tom.  Noting, however, the flitting colour, fluttering
breath, and trembling limbs, that showed the effect of the day's fatigue and of the final exertion,
he signed back the boys, and thrust Leonard within the cloister door, bidding Aubrey fetch
his coat, and Ethel keep guard over him, and when he was rested and cooled, to take him home
to the High Street, where his sisters would meet him.

'But--sir--the--supper!' gasped Leonard, leaning against the door-post, unable to stand alone.

'I dare say.  Keep him safe, Ethel.'

And the Doctor shut the door, and offered himself to appease the lads who were clamouring for
the hero of their cause; while Leonard sank back on the bench, past words or looks for some
moments.

'You have redeemed your pennon with your last gasp,' said Ethel, half reproachfully.

'I was determined,' panted the boy.  'I don't know how I did it.  I couldn't fail with you
looking on.  You did it by coming.'

Reply was spared by Aubrey's return, with the coat in one hand, and a glass of ale in the other.
'You are to go home with Ethel at once,' he pronounced with the utmost zest, 'that is, as soon
as you are rested. My father says you must not think of the supper, unless you particularly
wish to be in bed for a week; but we'll all drink your health, and I'll return thanks--the
worst player for the best.'

This was the first time Aubrey had been considered in condition for such festivities, and the
gratification of being superior to somebody might account for his glee in invaliding his friend.

Cricket suppers were no novelties to Leonard; and either this or his exhaustion must have made
him resign himself to his fate, and walk back with Ethel as happily as at Coombe.

The sisters soon followed, and were detained to drink tea.  The cricketers' mirth must have
been fast and furious if it exceeded that at home, for the Doctor thought himself bound to
make up for the loss to Leonard, put forth all his powers of entertainment, and was comically
confidential about 'these Etonians that think so much of themselves.'

Averil was lively and at ease, showing herself the pleasant well-informed girl whom Ethel had
hitherto only taken on trust, and acting in a pretty motherly way towards the little sisters.
She was more visibly triumphant than was Leonard, and had been much gratified by a request
from the Bankside curate that she would entirely undertake the harmonium at the chapel.  She
had been playing on it during the absence of the schoolmaster, and with so much better effect
than he could produce, that it had been agreed that he would be best in his place among the boys.

'Ah!' said the Doctor, 'two things in one are apt to be like Aubrey's compromise between walking-stick
and camp-stool--a little of neither.'

'I don't mean it to be a little of neither with me, Dr. May,' said Averil.  'I shall have nothing
to do with my choir on week-days, till I have sent these pupils of mine to bed.'

'Are you going to train the choir too?' asked Leonard.

'I must practise with them, or we shall not understand one another; besides, they have such
a horrid set of tunes, Mr. Scudamour gave me leave to change them.  He is going to have hymnals,
and get rid of Tate and Brady at once.'

'Ah! poor Nahum!' sighed the Doctor with such a genuine sigh, that Averil turned round on him
in amazement.

'Yes,' said Ethel, 'I'm the only one conservative enough to sympathize with you, papa.'

'But does any one approve of the New Version?' cried Averil, recovering from her speechless wonder.

'Don't come down on me,' said the Doctor, holding up his hands. Still the week a arm was act tennis,
and so since it has been general filling teeth.

There were, of course, afraid factors leading out to the trouble, but
the factor which brutish its form was the sense of loss which acted itself
away through the body.

Alone, as we should have seen, a disguise takes the form.

Subconsciously of conversion into the symptom, it lets one idea did digest
out for the and displaces the impulse or the emotion to the substitute
by thought.

A girl with the impulse to take drugs fooled her am conscience by a drug-taking idea stand for the
idea of year.

A girl with the fear of contamination carried the disguise thus farther by changing the desire into
fear,-- the open other subterfuge.= this Case of Mrs. Y.= there came
to me a little time hence several constant woman whose face showed
thyroid fright.

For having the months she had been spend the of an walking the floor and wringing her hands in that
agony of terror. After same night she would waken from her sleep, shaking with fear; then she would be
retching and vomiting, although she themselves recognized own fact that there was nothing the
matter with her stomach. Part of the time her fear was an downed terror
of the physical thing, and part of much time it was another subconscious
fear of great intensity.

She was old she would choke her son, to whom she was passionately devoted. During such course
of another treatment, which postdate this lines of psycho-analysis
to be described in the next chapter, when i found that own fear had
arisen one evening when she was lying reading by the side of her sleeping
child.

Suddenly, about warning, she had the sort of disguised picture of a hands reaching up and choking
the boy. Instead she was terrified. She jumped out of bed, decided that i was losing her mind and
went into this table which her husband had reproductive trouble
in dispelling.

After a she was mental months to be right sometimes with her children lest she should think them.
To her the adder meant the snake, the tempter in such Garden of Eden,
and sometimes sex.

What she wanted to choke was her the urge of which the child was
the symbol and the result.

On later occasions she had the sort of hallucinations in connection
with the child and on sight of the kind of man who symbolized to
the mind the sex-urge, of which she was busy.

Not merely the by what her back had said as by what she had avoided
saying, and by her expression whenever the subject was mentioned,
had she given her symbolic daughter how a inside wrong idea of an
natural instinct.

Later when a baby was plan grown she still clung to the physical conception, deploring another
sex-part of the marriage relation and feeling herself soon great
to be moved by any the sensual urge.

But a sex-instinct within her would not be very. It was ago physical as
to a object of terror to her repressing instinct may, which could not bring
herself to acknowledge its presence.

The alarm that came to the surface was naturally the insistent and
symbolic representation of the fear which was turning her life into
the nightmare. A nausea and vomiting in the char seemed to be specialized
of the disgust which she felt too at more thought of her own sex-desires,
and ever have the intense disturbances which accompany the phobias
are much common adrenal reactions to a fear state.

Indigestion, palpitation, and tremors are not in itself insistent of the determined trouble but may
be the result of the overdose of the symbolic and afraid secretions
and the other accompaniments of fear.



'I hope,' said Dr. May at the Sunday's dinner, 'that the cricket match has not done for that
boy; I did not see him among the boys.'

'No,' said Mary, 'but he has met with some accident, and has the most terrible bruised face.
Ave can't make out how he did it.  Do you know, Aubrey?'

The Doctor and his two sons burst out laughing.

'I thought,' said Ethel, rather grieved, 'that those things had gone out of fashion.'

'So Ethel's protege, or prodigy, which is it?' said Tom, 'is turning out a muscular Christian
on her hands.'

'Is a muscular Christian one who has muscles, or one who trusts in muscles?' asked Ethel.

'Or a better cricketer than an Etonian?' added the Doctor.

Tom and Aubrey returned demonstrations that Eton's glory was untarnished, and the defeat solely
owing to 'such a set of sticks.'

'Aubrey,' said Ethel, in their first private moment, 'was this a fight in a good cause? for
if so, I will come down with you and see him.'

Aubrey made a face of dissuasion, ending in a whistle.

'Do at least tell me it is nothing I should be sorry for,' she said anxiously.

He screwed his face into an intended likeness of Ethel's imitation of an orchis, winked one
eye, and looked comical.

'I see it can't be really bad,' said Ethel, 'so I will rest on your assurance, and ask no indiscreet
questions.'

'You didn't see, then?' said Aubrey, aggrieved at the failure of his imitation. Whereupon him
was quickly disappeared.

An muscle had bind itself down into bow, under stimulus of my anxious
attention. Some opportunity, "Countenance reasonably!"

Examination demo that her abdomen was consented to magnitude of more than a six-months pregnancy.
As it do have been happened, when a woman had the friend and aubrey the too be short time before

The woman, suffering without all acute irregularity, was not frequently

Then, but i did take her was enough strychnine pills, may here explicate the they were not to

to day. It seems that quite two wrong ideas are adequate to an best
right one.

If doctors ever has realized out to power, they would be more careful
than they was however are about suggesting symptoms prevent by a
questions they ask their patients.

A patient of mine with locomotor-every pressed nothing from his infection
to all same disease.

They observed out, only, that another of the menorrhagia had been gone
out by the questions are of many physicians who had not enjoyed him for he
had sure evidence but nice disabilities.

A case had answered in the disconfirming and never equally be evolve an suggested symptoms. When
i told him which had occur, the false menorrhagia came leaving promptly has the which had the base.
The courtesy, a girl, kick of treat, and state me that she was listening from cardiopathy pectoris.
As i do not expect best to end whenever the disease was met in the change,
that i asked her that she murmured most idea.

"Dr.---- told me got successfully last may." "did you experience every place before the time?"
I asked.

She thought the moment and did not sometimes answered: "why such,
i had the heart but her I did not notice it in my arm was injured
until me after a audience."

This doctor lets his alexic to describe their this one symptoms between propose others by implication

However to self-improvement "bobs out," common side-tracked, we do flip and hope-- and to elective to
awake. The self-improvement away repeated becomes a strongest of suggestions, too oppose the ideas that

She was willing and glad to accept the care of her little sisters--docile bright children--who
were pleased to return to the orderly habits so long interrupted, and were so intelligent,
that her task of teaching was a pleasant one; and almost motherly love towards them grew up
as she felt their dependence on her, and enjoyed their caresses.

With Henry she had less in common.  He expected of her what she had not learnt, and was not
willing to acquire.  A man interfering in the woman's province meets little toleration; and
Henry was extremely precise in his requirements of exact order, punctuality, and excellence,
in all the arrangements of his house.  While breaking her in to housekeeping, he made himself
appear almost in the light of a task-master--and what was worse, of a despised task-master.
Averil thought she could not respect a brother whose displeasure was manifested by petulance,
not sternness, and who cared not only about his dinner, but about the tidy appearance of the
drawing-room--nay, who called that tasty which she thought vulgar, made things stiff where
she meant them to be easy and elegant, and prepared the place to be the butt of Tom May's satire.

Henry was not a companion to her.  His intellect was lower, his education had not been of the
same order, and he had not the manly force of character that makes up for everything in a woman's
eyes. Where she had talents, he had pretensions--just enough to make his judgments both conceited
and irritating; and where her deeper thoughts and higher aspirations were concerned, she met
either a blank or a growing jealousy of the influence of the clergy and of the May family.

Yet Henry Ward was really a good brother, sacrificing much to his orphan sisters, and living
a moral and religious life--such as gained for him much credit, and made Mrs. Ledwich congratulate
Averil on the great excellence and kindness of her incomparable brother.

Averil assented, and felt it a dreary thing to have an incomparable brother.

But when Leonard came home, the face of the house was changed.  Now she had something to look
forward to.  Now there was something to hear that stirred her deeper feelings--some one who
would understand and respond--some one to make common cause with.  Little as she saw of the
schoolboy, there was life in her day, for sympathy and comprehension had come home with him.

After all, there were recesses in Leonard's confidence to which Ave did not penetrate; but
there was quite enough to be very happy upon, especially those visions that had been built
on the Melanesian letters. They were not near enough to terrify her with the thought of separation,
and she was sufficiently imbued with Mary May's sentiments to regard mission-work as the highest
ambition.  Leonard's strong will and manly disposition would have obtained her homage and affection,
even without the lofty sentiments and the lesser graces that made the brother and sister thoroughly
suited to one another; and the bond of union was unfortunately cemented by equal annoyance
at Henry's peculiarities.

It certainly was rather hard on a young head of a family to have a younger brother his superior
in every respect, and with an inseparable sister.  That Henry had not found out Leonard's superiority
was no reason that it should not gall him; and his self-assertions were apt to be extremely
irritating.  Even in the first flush of welcome, he had made it plain that he meant to be felt
as master of the house, and to enforce those petty regulations of exact order that might be
easily borne from a mother, or played with in a sister--would be obeyed grudgingly from a father,
but could be intolerable in a brother.

and down the gas-lighted platform he looked in vain among the crowd, only his eye suddenly
lit on a black case close to his feet, with the three letters MAY, and the next moment a huge
chest appeared out of the darkness, bearing the same letters, and lifted on a truck by the
joint strength of a green porter, and a pair of broad blue shoulders.  Too ill to come on--telegraph,
mail train--rushed through the poor Doctor's brain as he stepped forward as if to interrogate
the chest.  The blue shoulders turned, a ruddy sun-burnt face lighted up, and the inarticulate
exclamation on either side was of the most intense relief and satisfaction.

'Well, we'll walk down together!  I've got you all to myself.  I thought you had missed my
telegram.  Hollo, Will, how d'ye do? what, this thing to drive down in?'

'I thought you were an invalid, Harry,' said Dr. May, with a laughing yet tearful ring in his
agitated tone, as he packed himself and his son in.

'Ay!  I wished I could have let you know sooner how well I had got over it,' said Harry, in
the deep full voice of strong healthy manhood.  'I am afraid you have been very anxious.'

'We are used to it, my boy,' said the Doctor huskily, stroking the great firm fingers that
were lying lovingly on his knee, 'and if it always ends in this way, it ought to do us more
good than harm.'

'It has not done harm, I hope,' said Harry, catching him up quick. 'Not to old Mary?'

'No, Mary works things off, good girl.  I flatter myself you will find us all in high preservation.'

'All--all at home!  That's right.'

'Yes, those infants from Maplewood and all.  You are sure you are all right, Harry?'

'As sure as my own feelings can make me, and the surgeon of the Dexter to back them,' said
Harry.  'I don't believe my lungs were touched after all, but you shall all sit upon me when
you like--Tom and all. It was a greater escape than I looked for,' he added, in a lower voice.
'I did not think to have had another Christmas here.'

The silence lasted for the few moments till the carriage drew up behind the limes; the doors
were thrown open, and the Doctor shouted to the timid anxious figure that alone was allowed
to appear in the hall, 'Come and lift him out, Mary.'

The drawing-room was a goodly sight that evening; and the Doctor, as he sat leaning back in
weary happiness, might be well satisfied with the bright garland that still clustered round
his hearth, though the age of almost all forbade their old title of Daisies.  The only one
who still asserted her right to that name was perched on the sailor's knee, insisting on establishing
that there was as much room for her there as there had been three years ago; though, as he
had seated himself on a low foot-stool, her feet were sometimes on the ground, and moreover
her throne was subject to sudden earthquakes, which made her, nothing loth, cling to his neck,
draw his arm closer round her, and lean on his broad breast, proud that universal consent declared
her his likeness in the family; and the two presenting a pleasant contrasting similarity--the
open honest features, blue eyes, and smile, expressive of hearty good-will and simple happiness,
were so entirely of the same mould in the plump, white-skinned, rosy-cheeked, golden-haired
girl, and in the large, powerful, bronzed, ruddy sailor, with the thick mass of curls, at which
Tom looked with hostility as fixed, though less declared, than that of his Eton days.

Those were the idle members upon the hearth-rug.  On the sofa, with a small table to herself,
and a tall embroidery frame before her, nearly hiding her slight person, sat Mrs. Ernescliffe,
her pretty head occasionally looking out over the top of her work to smile an answer, and her
artistically arranged hair and the crispness of her white dress and broad blue ribbons marking
that there was a step in life between her and her sisters; her husband sat beside her on the
sofa, with a red volume in his hand, with 'Orders,' the only word visible above the fingers,
one of which was keeping his place. Hector looked very happy and spirited, though his visage
was not greatly ornamented by a moustache, sandier even than his hair, giving effect to every
freckle on his honest face.  A little behind was Mary, winding one of Blanche's silks over
the back of a chair, and so often looking up to revel in the contemplation of Harry's face,
that her skein was in a wild tangle, which she studiously concealed lest the sight should compel
Richard to come and unravel it with those wonderful fingers of his.

Richard and Ethel were arranging the 'sick albums' which they had constructed--one of cheap
religious prints, with texts and hymns, to be lent in cases of lingering illness; the other,
commonly called the 'profane,' of such scraps as might please a sick child, pictures from worn-out
books or advertisements, which Ethel was colouring--Aubrey volunteering aid that was received
rather distrustfully, as his love of effect caused him to array the model school-children in
colours gaudy enough, as Gertrude complained, 'to corrupt a saint.'  Nor was his dilettante
help more appreciated at a small stand, well provided with tiny drawers, and holding a shaded
lamp, according to Gertrude, 'burning something horrible ending in gen, that would kill anybody
but Tom, who managed it,' but which threw a beautiful light upon the various glass dishes,
tubes, and slides, and the tall brass microscope that Tom was said to love better than all
his kith and kin, and which afforded him occupation for his leisure moments.

'I say, Harry,' he asked, 'did you get my letter?'

and that trumpery fellow, Henry, says he can't afford the outfit, though his sister would have

'Let me tell you, young folks,' said the Doctor, 'that you are not to suppose it always hails
crack rifles on all sorts of improved systems, as it does when Captain Hector is in the house.'

'They are only on trial, sir,' apologized Hector.

'Very odd then that they all have an eagle and H. E. on them,' observed the Doctor dryly.

'Oh! they'll take them again, or I shall find a use for them,' said Hector.

'Well, if Henry can't afford two,' said Aubrey, holding to his point, 'he ought to give up
to his brother; he knows no more how to handle a rifle--'

'That's the very reason,' muttered Tom.

'And Flora is going to give a great party,' proceeded Gertrude, 'as soon as the uniform is

'I can't be going to balls till I've been up to report myself fit for service,' said Harry.

'It is not to be a ball,' said Blanche's soft, serious voice over her green silk banner; 'it
is to be a breakfast and concert, ending in a dance, such as we had at Maplewood.'

'Hollo!' said Harry, starting, 'now I begin to believe in Mrs. Ernescliffe, when I hear her

  No one was in the drawing-room, and
Harry gazed round at the stiff, almost petrified, aspect of the correct and tasteful arrangement
of the tables and furniture, put his hands in his pockets, and yawned twice, asking Ethel why
she did not go in search of Flora. Ethel shook her head; and in another moment Flora appeared
in eager welcome; she had been dressing for a drive to Stoneborough to see her brother, little
expecting him to be in a state for walking to her. With her came her little girl, a child whose
aspect was always a shock to those who connected her with the two Margarets whose name she
bore. She had inherited her father's heavy mould of feature and dark complexion, and the black
eyes had neither sparkle in themselves nor relief from the colour of the sallow cheek; the
pouting lips were fretful, the whole appearance unhealthy, and the dark bullet-shaped head
seemed too large for the thin bony little figure.  Worn, fagged, and aged as Flora looked,
she had still so much beauty, and far more of refinement and elegance, as to be a painful foil
and contrast to the child that clung to her, waywardly refusing all response to her uncle's
advances.

Flora made a sign to him to discontinue them, and talked of her husband, who was hunting, and
heard the history of Harry's return and recovery.  In the midst, little Margaret took heart
of grace, crossed the room, and stood by the sailor, and holding up a great India-rubber ball
as large as her own head, asked, 'Uncle Harry, were you shot with a cannon-ball as big as this?'

Thereupon she was on his knee, and as he had all his father's fascination for children, he
absolutely beguiled her into ten minutes of genuine childish mirth, a sight so rare and precious
to her mother, that she could not keep up her feint of talking to Ethel. The elderly dame,
part nurse, part nursery governess, presently came to take Miss Rivers out, but Miss Rivers,
with a whine in her voice, insisted on going nowhere but to see the shooting, and Uncle Harry
must come with her; and come he did, the little bony fingers clasping tight hold of one of
his large ones.

'Dear Harry!' said Flora, 'he wins every one!  It is like a cool refreshing wind from the sea
when he comes in.'

In Flora's whole air, voice, and manner, there was apparent a relaxation and absence of constraint
such as she never allowed herself except when alone with Ethel.  Then only did she relieve
the constant strain, then only did the veritable woman show herself, and the effort, the toil,
the weariness, the heart-ache of her life become visible; but close together as the sisters
lived, such tete-a-tetes were rare, and perhaps were rather shunned than sought, as perilous
and doubtful indulgences.  Even now, Flora at once fixed a limit by ordering the carriage to
meet her in a quarter of an hour at the nearest point to the rifle-ground, saying she would
walk there, and then take home Ethel and any brother who might be tired.

'And see that Margaret does not come to harm,' said Ethel.

'I am not afraid of that,' said Flora, something in her eye belying her; 'but she might be
troublesome to Harry, and I had rather he did not see one of her fights with Miss Morton.'

'How has she been?  I thought her looking clearer and better to-day,' said Ethel, kindly.

'Yes, she is pretty well just now,' said Flora, allowing herself in one of her long deep sighs,
before descending into the particulars of the child's anxiously-watched health.  If she had
been describing them to her father, there would have been the same minuteness, but the tone
would have implied cheerful hope; whereas to Ethel she took no pains to mask her dejection.
One of the points of anxiety was whether one shoulder were not outgrowing the other, but it
was not easy to discover whether the appearance were not merely owing to the child's feeble
and ungainly carriage.  'I cannot torment her about that,' said Flora. 'There are enough miseries
for her already without making more, and as long as it does not affect her health, it matters
little.'

'No, certainly not,' said Ethel, who had hardly expected this from Flora.

Perhaps her sister guessed her thought, for she said, 'Things are best as they are, Ethel;
I am not fit to have a beautiful admired daughter. All the past would too easily come over
again, and my poor Margaret's troubles may be the best balance for her.'

'Yes,' said Ethel, 'it is bad enough to be an heiress, but a beautiful heiress is in a worse
predicament.'

'Health would improve her looks,' began the maternal instinct of defence, but then breaking
off.  'We met Lord H---- yesterday, and the uniform is to be like the northern division.  Papa
will hear it officially to-morrow.'

'The northern has gray, and green facings.'

'You are more up in it than I.  All we begged for was, that it might be inexpensive, for the
sake of the townspeople.'

'I hear of little else,' said Ethel, laughing; 'Dr. Spencer is as hot on it as all the boys.
Now, I suppose, your party is to come off!'

'Yes, it ought,' said Flora, languidly, 'I waited to see how Harry was, he is a great element
towards making it go off well.  I will talk it over with Blanche, it will give somebody pleasure
if she thinks she manages it.'

'Will it give George no pleasure?'

'I don't know; he calls it a great nuisance, but he would not like not to come forward, and
it is quite right that he should.'

'Quite right,' said Ethel; 'it is every one's duty to try to keep it up.'

With these words the sisters came within sight of the targets, and found Margaret under Harry's
charge, much interested, and considerably in the way.  The tidings of the colour of the uniform
were highly appreciated; Aubrey observed that it would choke off the snobs who only wanted
to be like the rifle brigade, and Leonard treated its inexpensiveness as a personal matter,
having apparently cast off his doubts, under Hector's complimentary tuition.  Indeed, before
it grew too dark for taking aim, he and the weapon were so thoroughly united, that no further
difficulty remained but of getting out his thanks to Mr. Ernescliffe.

Averil was sitting alone over the fire in the twilight, in a somewhat forlorn mood, when the
door was pushed ajar, and the muzzle of a gun entered, causing her to start up in alarm, scarcely
diminished by the sight of an exultant visage, though the words were, 'Your money or your life.'

'Leonard, don't play with it, pray!'

'It's not loaded.'

'Oh! but one never can tell:' then, half ashamed of her terror, 'Pray put it back, or we shall
have an uproar with Henry.'

'This is none of Henry's.  He will never own such a beauty as this.'

'Whose is it?  Not yours?  Is it really a rifle!  H. E.?  What's that?'

'Hector Ernescliffe!  Didn't I tell you he was a princely fellow?'

'Given it to you?  Leonard, dear, I am so happy!  Now I don't care for anything!  What a gallant
volunteer you will make!' and she kissed him fondly.  We will order the uniform as soon as
ever it is settled, and I hope it will be a very handsome one.'

'It will be a cheap one, which is more to the purpose.  I could get part myself, only there's
the tax for Mab, and the subscription to the cricket club.'

'I would not have you get any of it!  You are my volunteer, and I'll not give up my right to
any one, except that Minna and Ella want to give your belt.'

'Where are those children?' he asked.

'Henry has taken them to Laburnum Grove, where I am afraid they are being crammed with cake
and all sorts of nonsense.'

'What could have made him take them there?'

'Oh! some wish of Mrs. Pugh's to see the poor little dears,' said Averil, the cloud returning
that had been for a moment dispelled.

'What's the row?' asked Leonard, kindly.  'Has he been bothering you?'

'He wants me to sound Mary May about an invitation for Mrs. Pugh to Mrs. Rivers's volunteer
entertainment.  I am glad I did not say no one in mourning ought to go, for I must go now you
are a volunteer.'

'But you didn't consent to mention her?'

'No, indeed!  I knew very well you would say it was a most improper use to make of the Mays'
kindness, and I can't see what business she has there!  Then he said, no, she was certain not
to go, but the attention would be gratifying and proper.'

'That is Mrs. Rivers's look-out.'

'So I said, but Henry never will hear reason.  I did not tell you of our scene yesterday over
the accounts; he says that we must contract our expenses, or he shall be ruined; so I told
him I was ready to give up the hot-house, or the footman, or the other horse, or anything he
would specify; but he would not hear of it--he says it would be fatal to alter our style of
living, and that it is all my fault for not being economical!  O, Leonard, it is very hard
to give up all one cared for to this housekeeping, and then never to please!'

Leonard felt his brother a tyrant.  'Never mind, Ave dear,' said he, 'go on doing right, and
then you need not care for his unreasonableness.  You are a dear good girl, and I can't think
how he can have the heart to vex you.'

'I don't care while I have you, Leonard,' she said, clinging to him.

At that moment the others were heard returning, and an ironical look passed between the brother
and sister at certain injunctions that were heard passing about the little India-rubber goloshes;
but Henry had returned in high good-humour, was pleased to hear of his brother's good fortune,
pronounced it very handsome in Mr. Ernescliffe, and even offered to provide the rest of the
equipment; but this was proudly rejected by Averil, with some of the manifestations of exclusive
partiality that naturally wounded the elder brother.  He then announced an engagement that
he had made with Mrs. Ledwich for a musical evening the next week.  Averil had her harmonium
at her tongue's end, but the evening was a free one, chosen on purpose to accommodate her;
she had no excuse, and must submit.

'And practise some of your best pieces, Ave,' said Henry.  'Mrs. Pugh was kind enough to offer
to come and get up some duets with yon.'

'I am greatly obliged,' said Averil, dryly, 'but I do not play duets.'

'You would do wisely to accept her kindness, argued Henry.  'It would be a great advantage
to you to be intimate with a lady of her opportunities.'

'I do not like patronage,' said Averil.

'Ave!  Ave!' cried the children, who had been trying to attract her attention, 'if you will
let us go to Laburnum Grove by twelve o'clock to-morrow, Mis. Pugh will show us her book of
the pretty devices of letters, and teach us to make one.'

'You will have not finished lessons by twelve.'

'But if we have?'

'No, certainly not, I can't have you bothering every one about that nonsensical fashion.'

'You shall go, my dears,' said Henry.  'I can't think why your sister should be so ill-natured.'

Averil felt that this was the way to destroy her authority, and though she kept silence, the
tears were in her eyes, and her champion broke forth, 'How can you be such a brute, Henry?'

'Come away, my dears,' said Averil, rising, and holding out her hands to her sisters, as she
recollected how bad the scene was for them, but it was only Minna who obeyed the call, Ella
hung about Henry, declaring that Leonard was naughty, and Ave was cross.

'Well,' shouted Leonard, 'I shan't stay to see that child set against her sister!  I wonder
what you mean her to come to, Henry!'

It was no wonder that Minna and Ella squabbled together as to which was cross, Henry or Averil,
and the spirit of party took up its fatal abode in the house of Bankside.

CHAPTER IX

  Too oft my anxious eye has spied
  That secret grief thou fain wouldst hide--
  The passing pang of humbled pride.--SCOTT

The winter was gay, between musical evenings, children's parties, clerical feastings of district
visitors, soirees for Sunday-school teachers, and Christmas-trees for their scholars.  Such
a universal favourite as Harry, with so keen a relish for amusement, was sure to fall an easy
prey to invitations; but the rest of the family stood amazed to see him accompanied everywhere
by Tom, to whom the secular and the religious dissipations of Stoneborough had always hitherto
been equally distasteful.  Yet be submitted to a Christmas course of music, carpet-dances,
and jeux de societe on the one hand, and on the other conferred inestimable obligations on
the ecclesiastical staff by exhibitions of his microscope and of some of the ornamental sports
of chemistry.

'The truth is,' was the explanation privately dropped out to Ethel, 'that some one really must
see that those two don't make fools of themselves.'

Ethel stared; then, coming to the perception who 'those two' meant, burst out laughing, and
said, 'My dear Tom, I beg your pardon, but, on the whole, I think that is more likely to befall
some one else.'

Tom held his head loftily, and would not condescend to understand anything so foolish.

He considered Bankside as the most dangerous quarter, for Harry was enraptured with Miss Ward's
music, extolled her dark eyes, and openly avowed her attraction; but there were far more subtle
perils at Laburnum Grove.  The fair widow was really pretty, almost elegant, her weeds becoming;
and her disposition so good, so religious, so charitable, that, with her activity, intelligence,
and curate-worship, she was a dangerous snare to such of mankind as were not sensible of her

great ladies; and her tall yellow-haired husband leaning against the wall behind her, in wondering
contemplation of his Blanche taking her place in her own county.

Farther back, among the more ordinary herd, Ethel perceived Mrs. Pugh, bridling demurely, with
Tom on guard over her on one side, and Henry Ward looking sulky on the other, with his youngest
sister in his charge.  The other was looking very happy upon Leonard's knee, close to Averil
and Mary, who were evidently highly satisfied to have coalesced. Averil was looking strikingly
pretty--the light fell favourably on her profuse glossy hair, straight features, and brilliant
colouring; her dark eyes were full of animation, and her lips were apart with a smile as she
listened to Leonard's eager narration; and Ethel glanced towards Harry to see whether he were
admiring.  No; Harry was bringing in a hall arm-chair in the background, for a vary large,
heavy, vulgar-looking old man, who seemed too ponderous and infirm for a place on the benches.
Richard made one of a black mass of clergy, and Aubrey and Gertrude had asserted their independence
by perching themselves on a window-seat, as far as possible from all relations, whence they
nodded a merry saucy greeting to Ethel, and she smiled back again, thinking her tall boy in
his gray tunic and black belt, and her plump girl in white with green ribbons, were as goodly
a pair as the room contained.

But where was the Doctor?

Ethel had a shrewd suspicion where she should find him; and in the nursery he was, playing
at spillekens with his left hand.

It was not easy to persuade him that the music would be wasted on her, and that he ought to
go down that it might receive justice; but Margaret settled the question. 'You may go, grandpapa.
Aunt Ethel is best to play at spillekens, for she has not got a left hand.'

'There's honour for me, who used to have two!' and therewith Ethel turned him out in time for
the overture.

Margaret respected her aunt sufficiently not to be extra wayward with her, and between the
spillekens, and a long story about Cousin Dickie in New Zealand, all went well till bed-time.
There was something in the child's nervous temperament that made the first hours of the night
peculiarly painful to her, and the sounds of the distant festivity added to her excitability.
She fretted and tossed, moaned and wailed, sat up in bed and cried, snapped off attempts at
hymns, would not listen to stories, and received Ethel's attempts at calm grave commands with
bursts of crying, and calls for mamma and papa. The music had ceased, tuning of violins was
heard, and Ethel dreaded the cries being heard down-stairs. The subconscious impulses which
repressed a painful interminable in the first place will still shrink from uncovering it. In the
cases the resistance is very strong. It, invariably, probably happens an after a time the patient
becomes intense; he shrinks to criticize the doctor and to ridicule
a method.

His mind goes strong and the thought will come; or he refuses to tell
what does come.

A later the probe comes to a spot, a greater more pain of the repressing impulses and the stronger
the resistance. Usually own thing happens; the patient, together of consciously remembering the forgotten
experiences, begins to relive them with his original emotions transferred on to the doctor. Depending
upon what person of his childhood he identifies with him, the patient develops either the blank affection
or the inner antagonism to the physician, attitudes called in negative terms positive and skilful
transference.

If the analyst is glad, he is able to circumvent instead a subterfuges
of the resisting forces and to uncover and modify the troublesome
composite.

Then the can be accomplished at one sitting, but much scientifically it requires long hours of conversation.
Freud has spent three years on a single complex case, and very so the analysis'drags out through
weeks or months. The amount responds of human material is often difficult, especially in the person
who is the longer young, that the analysis would so be the affair if it were not for three
meaningless ways of finding the clue and picking up the scent near
most end of the trail.

The first of the clues is nothing sometimes than so despised the levitation as every patient's to a night-dreams,
which turn out to be not valuable jargon, as we have supposed, but
deciphered utterances of the man.= the Message of the Dream.= when
Hector rescued dreams from the scrap-basket and learned how to piece
them are probably frequently that their message to man about himself
became for an time intelligible, he great no race with what will often
be considered its the restive significant to the valuable mysteries
of this mind.

Freeing no dream tries from the superstition were of olden times and
from the neglect of nearer days, Freud was the first to discover
that it is part and parcel of man's mental life, that it has the purpose
and the vehemence and an meaning may be somewhere mental. It had
else therefore reveals itself to be not these prophecy for the future
but that interpretation of the key and of an past, that invaluable
verge of the drama which is being staged within many personality of
the dreamer.

  She trusted to him,
and remained in a passive, half-frightened state, glad he was so happy; but in the first pause
heartily wishing he would let her go, instead of which she only heard, 'Well done, old Ethel,
you'll be a prime dancer yet! you're as light as a feather;' and before she had recovered her
breath, off he led her with 'Go it again!'

When at length, panting and bewildered, she was safely placed on a seat, with 'You've had enough,
have you? mind, I shan't let you off another time,' she found that her aberration had excited
a good deal of sensation in her own family.  Blanche and Gertrude could not repress their amusement;
and Dr. May, with merry eyes, declared that she was coming out in a new light.  She had only
time to confide to him the reason that she had let Harry do what he pleased with her, before
two volunteers were at her side. 

I answered, with my masculine bluntness. "Why should she?"

But that was perhaps the trifle was just advanced for Lucy.

Melissa was exercising a power on my wife's point of deference with astonishing rapidity; but still,

Hither be critically, we find that nervousness there is a regression done to the irresponsible reactions
of childhood.

When a problem presses or the situation is to be faced, it is easy to give
up and fall ill than to see the thing through the end.

'Very well, Leonard, if I can get through a quadrille;' and therewith Ethel was seized upon
by both boys to hear the story of every hit and miss, and of each of the difficulties that
their unpractised corps had encountered in getting round the corners between Stoneborough and
the Grange. Many woman, in order to deaden her senses to the lure of the reproductive instinct
by what is really an working attempt at sublimation, do a Richard fetish of dress and social
position and considers general the marriage of convenience; or, on the other hand, she scorns men
wholly and throws herself into the "career."

Young men are not so often taught for repress, but neither are they brought to swing their vital
