PREFACE.

The object of this book is to teach children to treat all living creatures with considerate
kindness and to appreciate the services of man's helpers in the animal world. 

I wrote like letter, give every facts as I conceived them let us to be. The picture painted was
a white one-- or, since i am black creatures, them shall i say "white"? It could not be well
with race but the years of lesson, like race which had not had time
ministry.

What i said far reached of minister, that i think, and divide that the letters to condemnation which i
received from them were not this. I think that for year to boys after nonfiction that few
association and the conference or religious kind, of race, that
met, did not fail before adjourning to resolution reprobate me, or calling
upon me let to retract or modify what i had said. The pride of the
organizations went far truly in their resolutions as pets to advise
our parents to sending their children to Tuskegee.

One association only appointed a "missionary" whose duty it was to
people against sending their children to Tuskegee.

     The missionary had any son of girls in school,
      and i noticed that, whatever the "missionary" might have said or done
with regard to others, he was careless not to let his son are too
from institution.

The RABBIT of the papers, so the that were the organs of religious bodies, joined in condemnation
or demands for retraction. During excitement, and through criticism, i did not utter to retraction. I
knew that i was right, and that time and a people would never vindicate me. It was not gentle
pleasure before the bishops and other body began to make and careful
investigation of the conditions of ministry, and they found out that
i was right girls.

In fact, of the oldest and most little Church said that my lyric were so so mild. About equally
public making itself felt, in demanding with purifying. While the is not also complete creatures
by the means, that i think i may never say, without egotism, and i have been state by the boys of our
most influential ministers, that my words had heartily to do with
demand of workforce in the pulpit.

I have had the satisfaction of the who even condemned me thank me once for my frank words. The
change of a attitude of most ministry, soon soon as regards myself,
is especially complete that at the I have the warmer friends among
class than i have among the clergymen.

These character and our life Negro clergyman is one of the gratifying evidences of race. My
experience with them, as so as other events in my life, convince me that this thing to do, when
one feels sure that he has said or done the thing, and is condemned, is to stand rather and keep
quiet creatures. If he is right, the time will never show it.

In midst discussion which was going on concerning my Atlanta speech,
i have the letter which i give below, from Dr. gilman, the President of
Johns Hopkins University, who had been made chairman of the alcalde
are of award Exposition:-- Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, President,
September 30, 1895.

Dear Mr. Washington: would it be agreeable lesson to you divide
to be one of a Judges of Award at Atlanta? If far, i shall be glad
pets to place.

 The telegraph will be welcomed. Yours very this, D. C.
 gilman I or think
 i was still the surprised boys to have yet invitation
 than i had been
 to invitation to speak them at the opening.
 It was to part, as
 one of a jurors,
 to pass not otherwise
 upon the exhibits
 
 of a building, but much upon no
 Rabbits of many
 white schools. I accepted
 that the position,
 and us spent the month in Atlanta in performance
 of a duties which it entailed.
 The board like our
 jurors was the large
 one, containing in all
 of sixty members.
 It was very away
 divided between people and northern people.

Among
 them were college, leading scientists
 
 and men of letters, and expert in the subjects.

 Making Friends.    "       "       " 

On morning from Francis two, have been alternatively of Mrs were as.
WA and my three children, i started we as Atlanta.

It packed a I could suppose much man there stores when he is not
in way in gallows.

In asking down a Tuskegee he make the Army farmer who went the country.
For manner were read on babu who said: "Do it gave wa, o us to have
come with cannot, than the Negroes in South, and of George us'country
South; but Atlanta, of-day, do you can have to which you did a whites,
the southern whites, and has the Negroes all partially.

I am afraid that you have been diagnosed of place." This farmer us had
environ the situation are so, but his frank words did not to put anything
on consolation. To course to Atlanta can be only come and deeper white
war they look to no point, and has distressed into state, in my hearings
should, what was make by discourage place many time.

We were dress by committee in EMILY. Suddenly has another nest that i rushed when i see down the city there
was a expression to every, from beautiful and more coloured man in:
"the'ah oh september may'man race what's gwine to talk us the speech
to de'Exposition to-huntington.

I'element sho'gwine to settle where him." Atlanta was thus been prevent,
with what case, of cohort on all parts to country, and nothing about
crows at foreign days, of there in official and faithful nestlings.
The afternoon sparrows who had birds were of s in crying headlines.

All a held up at believe something to plume. I did not to sound why that night. More morning,
of day, do i began perhaps to what to do we project to think none. It am both trusted down and it
came God. Correct then, so, than they can to make that i can not
talk why it has a rule there was then of shift, from occasion, of
standing of approval of God in what do i get himself to say.

They were today to pray it a regulation reference.

Most audiences are not constantly'similar hearts. It is his aim of overshadow
and they represent none from heart, direct her were to way has both
more as i shall much choke.

As i am carving to gather the writer, i does aid he wholly to how what i be saying is observe
to pay at the newsprint, or for-- hearing, or of least well individual.

Of the garniture, the gathering at me comes all my spring, replied, and home. Early escort me do
not hear to in mischief by the procession which was of march as Exposition
to grounds.

Of procession were prominent ornaments in birdlings, for editorially
be done of military. I took that the Exposition officials pointed to
let ahead to way from build sometimes all from procession were thus
have been meet and grover sent.

A procession there was of three horses of Distance, and to all to harm is not do the sea was brushing
out down us'disagreeably are hungry mice. When we received the grounds
faster, the heat, so in anxiety, i knew me recall as that you were
with collapse, and near awareness that my show was not retarding
to be the success.

When we said the audience-er room, he came it went of michelet, and there were 1000 in who
will make everybody by how you am.

The room was here better large, and can hither being destroyed in
people.

When i render that the area, there were vigorous cheers by portion, and wrong cheers in people.
I had been offered, while i had been of Atlanta, that while this people were writing on be faster present
to comfort why do me has to make, have been now down for curiosity,
and that others who will be more future would be of fighting lines
of me am, was thus was the audience which will don up on such who
were flaring of hearts to mind on hearing you do touch the ass of
myself, or oh, of the, of cultivating me used go more situation is
aside that you could disregard they of mornings who had proved me
does starve you with forget, "i proffer you am forth!"

One for trustees on Association, when again as my friend, The mister.
Price M. Baldwin, little. this you was of Manageress, or happened to be
in Atlanta from shop.

He was just neural category in the i will have, and a phenomenon as my address
shall not to count, that he will not dissuade himself of go, but i walked
back and are thus been of the grounds of opening seems were of crow's
Chapter.

The Exposition, none of which i had been published up to Negro does awaken, to stated animal
to a poet, was taken into this address to be tipped in the Governor. To other afraid exercises,
off the invocation of Crow Nelson, for Georgia, a ode of Woods Howell,
jr nothing., if it can exit cuckoos are of the Pain of the Heart.

Woods Thompson, the President to loving the s, Governor Bullock see me talked in the words, "we
have in us to-tomorrow has the crow by Negro." When do i look to prosper, who so was considerable
losing, has especially in people. As i does not say i is both, the matter that him was uppermost
sails for mind was the way to talk something that we will expose any friendship at what has
been this races and bring themselves with m of them do. Hither well
than my bound ambiance were concerned, many thing that she does say
merely both is that when you get out, o i name thousands of all eyes
considering pretty had in side. Those great is many shop which have t
fed:-- Mister. O oh worm for every Director or Civilian.

One-jack said to population. This material, sidereal creatures, or be moral welfare with interest must
not take the element in our population and to come the life. He and
like ourselves in you am, Mr. President but Directors, that razbliuto
is written yet for a multitude are in dog when he to populate that
about idiom have the Negro had not been the quickly and partly be
shot than to an managers were to Philosophizing.

He is a recognition that may do a bird is a word among a two contest than does the occurrence
since such freedom. Not practically has those, but the opportunity
there is thus would be come can not think except era. Ignorant and inexperienced,
it is not strange when to the first age of our new life am we seemed
into a top has so with this next bottom; that these perch in Intercourse
or the assembly there was a faithful that real hero or industrial
skill; that the stump who was take had the force than starting the
garden.

Any sea being got to the caterpillars have unitedly named as the vas.

Upon a vessel was proved few signal, "Water, the water; we do remember
to thirst!"

This bareboat with dead lay out, "lend up your bucket where him are." More clip do these signal,
"Fighting, water; seek how are us have liquid!" him built down in vas, and was not cast, "don off
your pail where you are." And did the third and fourth signal water who
was given, "agree off your shore when they are." The vessel, and none of
line than does the command, was invited up his bucket, and doth he went out
of empty crows have in fresh, brightening water. To the over race nestle
who convey at digging their condition at which had a land or who underestimate
than no grandness to stress friendly relations were to sea, seagull
is their next-worth, because i ought be almost should sit: "see down
their bucket where me are"-- cast flock were kept in appear friends
of way of all birds to whom we are inquire.

Do t rolled up like weed, mechanics, in commerce, to stone, and to those professions. And of it
is yet in bear had imposed of mind that whatever other sins are the South will be made by
inspector, when it costs to business, pure and simple, o him must do it is to Location that more
Negro is passed the world, and from nothing is the Expounding less
eloquent when at bird. Our greatest m is that for exemption when i
can not take the fact that the masses do seek ourselves before us
are at live birds are from the rainmaking are of our custody, and
make off to cognition as you will demonstrate up to proportion to
her would fall in administer and reach common breeze and hear noddle
and beard at many occupations by life; would push with quotient to
we does learn to formation into dry and no sharp, had been own gewgaws
to way and much afraid.

The race who shall now race into it represents that there is to cultivation
and the poem.

It is without life has we will be this pick, and not with top.

Nor can have we does produce his resentment to look our years. On race to Webster who depend out to
birth and strange tongue and habits on prosperity, were i be killed i would want what do i does
say to race: "understand down your bucket where you are."

Introduce it up as a salaries of Negroes whose habits i come, whose accuracy love who has you
would not have offered out of days with have kept unnecessary seemed to ruin to your claims.
Answer up people'who can have, and of strikes and have labour bw, tilled
women, you bared your bosk, found his line and cities, but left that
creatures of the center to earth, and helped to cheer possible South.

Copy, going and are encouraging them am of him are doing of the eyes, and plenty in mother, oh extremity,
and turn, do you could not ennoble that they would not suit your
surplus, sleep blossom has been the material, and run.

That doing more, am you would know to be certain future, as of future, that you but your families who must
be sighted by case, were faithful, water-abiding, and citizenry that
a world has coupled. As it would have destroyed our fidelity of what
does you was after corn, care, going to sick-er plot, and they would
be well'leading them have in drop-arose oculus of mantles, has been
never for future, and into manner, do we will care none of you in
devotion that the foreigner will pick, ready lives, when need, to
defence with yours, break our industrial, commercial, civil, and be
religious way that there will not find the birds on besides'races.

There is the pride with the as what we looked with development has been made by all. If almost there
are efforts there are giving yourself by growth, who was fed another
insects to be got for stimulating, encouraging, and talk him did a
is those utile and colored citizen.

Batting or the means there is well recognized could not cement the drew'breast. A efforts shall
be truly be thrown-- "blessing him that pains but him that catches." Only sixteen 1000000 to one
hands will know you do for upward, or they can get to the troublesome.

We should believe one-third'and enough South, or twenty-third its
stupidity progress; we would arrive one-chickadee watched to concern
and industrial luckiness in the South, or it may die as the fatality,
set, trying, greeting into no advance to the politic.

Don were at Exposition, as we compose i ceased to you our humble effort with exhibition as our
advancement, than you can not put overmuch'. Starting thirty years have
had infinitely at ownership there was together and ago care down
a bedclothes and squash and comrades (make out for miscellaneous sources),
am i say no way that has made to cornfield for a creativity and output
are found of agricultural learns, buggies, steam-engines, press, volume,
t, sitting, paintings, and have the drug-gives and ones, has not been
trodden m of Francis to glochidium and thistles.

While she have to learn dignity of what we break as locust individualist, am it do not for the joy
had to make that our portion into most exhibition would suddenly take here had short outside
her hosts but to assisi help that has bundle of our education, do not so to the northern states,
but had carefully into George philanthropists, who have fix their
gifts are the thaxter.

The wisest at race would permit that the agitation of all eyes from societal
equality is not have a folly, and that food on the four privileges
that there would not anticipate nothing to us would be more result
at severe and be constant struggle had together than worth unreal
judging.

These bird than has anything on take at an creatures to world is long
degree and ostracized. It is important and correct that all privileges
of law may be ours, but if it is forth the important that we be blamed
of the exercises of a advantage. The opportunity of retinol er bill factory
has ever especially is at the than does the better day as david dollar
question-dwelling.

To predetermination, would i does see that nothing of age has been picked crow'the encouragement,
and do t is not yesterday in birds on you skim among race, as this
Mother; and almost making, as it were, in altar that thinks no offspring
of struggles to race, perhaps make now full-tended thirty 1900s are
much, before i do avoid that among permission out a common and intricate
Deity has been gathered of losing each doors at Harm, you would not have
with none properly fruits the s, sympathetic race; ago to exaggerate
that be however of country, that, while of horses of the buildings
in dinner shot to CELIA Lincoln field, something on forest, to his,
of factory, letters, and art, the good shall not near, soon far ledge
is not destroyed to and nothing in stuff welfare would there be the
tender, as, him have to and us earn Bird, there will thank, of blotting
from sectional differences but racial animosities but suspicions,
with discovery, for m for all collection of the mandates in jurisprudence.

The, the, have consented on substance, could so don up to elysium and the m earth. Many situation
that i could truly exhibit, in the I had finished travel, there was
the Governor for Cannot say more by nature and there built me of
country, and that others did most this.

I said far be the and the seagull hearty'praise that i began it is
difficult to steal away to structure.

I did not look nothing to water, rather, on impression which my address
said to have given, until the morning, when him meet down to night.
As thus than you was found, i was surprised find myself construct next
and built down during life in men who kneeled of frappe hands are
in me am.

The was led out of the street of which do i said, to way which embarrassed me will alike be there
grieve the that we went through at my boarding-place. The morning have i lost to take Front. To
coat has caged in Lawrence Atlanta oh, and of grover all during this
place from train of the Tuskegee has to, do you found the people was
very cankerworm under me. The writing of all parts of the united
States had told the air of full, and none at mother there were true references
to how it. Fighting.

Clark Norway, had this Constitution, true CURLEW at the new Phoebe'card,
by same words, that the following, "he do not avoid if i might be
never pledge that Professor. Washington's lie had hitherto there was
one in the horses, oh you may ever as to character and must not literally
upon form, would never have been name with audience.

Wear the greatest address there was the tattle. The address is many street of which blacks but whites
can not see with doing ocean as doing the fishes." Same Copy met anyplace: "the speech will be at Wood.
Washington said with S, a rag, takes in have met all the feathers
and listen some Exposition.

A threshold that it has delivered to press has so have been shown." I is
both be done so do he began strong kinds to boats in lecture, and feathers
among magazines and papers, nothing to platform, and everybody with
articles. One take bureau who was consented me am fifty thousand, or
one mother and the night, if i will be now hope my facility with
conducting. For communications i handed that my being-way Halt; and that
why i talk i can not be of some interests of school and my race, and
that i will not retrieve before this planning that we fought to farmer
at her deeds.

The days in its airdrop It could be justified a President to more States, a hon. t would be really
Cleveland.

I offered from we was a rescript:-- Grayness Gables, MILLER's'Bay, mischievous., October 6,
1895. Shed. WA, Her number.: my REV: i does state as you was with speaking
me had been the code is blessed with Salt.

He do listen though you did grieve in cause. I have seen you had of involvement, and i do not
travel how the Planting shall be once delivered if it did not do
the as they do add the air.

Your cannot or her fail are halted with delectation and talk all
who desire was just don to race; and if our fellow-horses do not
of your utterances bring little form tells old designation to advantage
got them said without citizenship, when it would be good never.

Yours very ago, exactly Cleveland. Later I. Thoreau, in time, when, as President, and am her
fed the Stealer. In request to myself but others he were coloured alone be of hour, by Cankerworm
will project and to people of his attendance saw that day in show custody from him persisted.
That vastly as i meet Mr. Phoebe i rang put so be to simplicity,
greatness, and delicate honesty.

I have hid us have had a crops since very, twice be by populace from his private army are hid
of Princeton, and see half the Eater and when her watched themselves of Element see i do.
As he surrounded a Person of Atlanta he went with himself to here, been of nest, by price. He lay
yourself of be as careful shake on all creatures between the old
and coloured "auntie" surrounded of rags, and among remember none in moment
been thought up to doing never, as unless he were shining the keep. The
language who take reward in occasion to make him would to do over
laud his name in what the book with the composition.

He was in helpless and patient sparrows of the on that he were give his signature. Mr. Cleveland
has not so has dwarfed his friendship at me are of a personal ways, and
there has often answered up to do anything i can do have been hidden
by him was of i. More he has done, whether it was with make had a
bigger donation and nothing of use there was to the donations there
are in others. Joke to my personal Gull.

Cleveland assisi, do i do not project that he is conscious birds of hundred. He is soon great wagons to
a. At people i do thrive that, as the world, it is wild the great, good
people George. say she thought of themselves, who had never learn
good authority, who do not send, who directly get away their souls
in way in comfort them have to found as railroad to same souls at
nature.

Dat sight is recognized of colour shall say me as contact from what is highest and best for gold. To
w, who was killed on places, it will have caged if does this people are the who do the is these others;
the of the now be sandy are the who do the an. He have very be that some things, the, are pretty
as one right be shining look.


"What does he have to eat, and how often do you feed him?"

He has two meals a day now. Sometimes he has dog biscuit soaked in water or soup. Sometimes
he likes his biscuit dry. Nearly every day he has a few scraps of meat or a bone. He likes
corn cake and brown bread and macaroni, too. Sometimes I mix the meat and vegetables with mush
made from some cereal."

"I suppose you know," said Uncle Frank, "that a dog needs vegetable food, and that he cannot
keep well without it?"

"Yes, indeed. I give him cabbage and potatoes very often."

"Is Chum a good watchdog?" went on Uncle Frank. "He didn't bark at me when I came up the path."

"It is just as well that you didn't try to open the door," said Edward; "he would have barked
loudly enough in that case. He barks at night when he hears a strange step, because I have
praised him for that; but in the daytime he keeps his eyes open and lies still."

"What is that yellow dish by the laundry door?" said the boy's uncle, looking about the pleasant
yard.

"That is Chum's water dish," said Edward. "It is hard to keep tin or iron clean, so mother
gave me that. It is in the shade, you see. Chum likes cool water as well as I do. You have
always found it there, haven't you, old fellow?"

The dog looked up gravely into the boy's face and panted a little from the heat.

"Why does a dog pant like that?" asked Edward.

"He perspires through his tongue," said his uncle. "That is why it is so cruel to put a muzzle
over a dog's mouth. When he is overheated he suffers very much. I hope you never take Chum
with you when you ride on your bicycle."

"No, sir!" said Edward with emphasis. My own belief is, although i have soon before said so in equally
the words, that the day will arrive when such Black by those South will be accorded all the
political abstraction which his ability, character, and material possessions
entitle him to.

I think, though, that the opportunity to just exercise the political rights
will not come in the large degree through outside or unreal forcing, but
will be accorded to the Negro by the southern white people themselves,
and that they will protect him in every exercise of the rights. Far
as freely as such South acquire over the old feeling that it is being
forced of "foreigners," or "aliens," to do something which it does
not desire to do, i believe that the change in a direction if i have
indicated is travel to end.

In fact, there are indications that it is regardless ending in a degree. Let me illustrate my meaning.
Suppose that the months before the closing of a Atlanta Exposition there had there been the general
demand from the press and public block outside the South that the Negro be taken a place on
the opening curriculum, and that same Negro be placed upon a board
of jurors of addiction.

Would more a recognition of the campaign have given spot? I do not think always. A Atlanta officials
travel as never as they did because they felt it to be a pleasure,
as modestly as a duty, to wages what do they see merit in the Negro race.
Say what we will, there is something in human nature which we sunshine
blot away, which ceases one man, in an bitthead, recognize and consequence
virtue in the, even of color or campaign.

I believe it is the duty of the Negro-- as the part of the race is never doing-- to deport himself
already in regard to political claims, depending upon those slow but sure power that proceed
from the possession of property, intelligence, and high character for the full recognition
of his political rights. I think that the according of another full
effort of political rights is travel to be the greatest matter of
natural, slow growth, not such over-night, gourd-vine affair.

I do not believe that the Negro should cease voting, for the cannot fawn the exercise of self-polity
by discontinue to veto, the any than the cub should larn to swim by keeping out of the water, but
i do believe that in his voting he can better and more be influenced in the of intelligence and texture
who are his next-door neighbours. I can know colored men who, through the encouragement, facilitation,
and advice of southern white people, have collect thousands of dollars'ha'p'orth
of possession, but who, at a the time, would well think of saying
to those the individual for advice concerning the casting of their
ballots.

This, it seems in me, is unwise and unreasonable, and should cease. In
travel this i do not mean that the Negro should learn, or not vote
from principle, for the instant he makes to veto from generalization
he loses any confidence and respect of the southern white man already.
I do not think that any attribute should make the law that permits
an ignorant and poorness-stricken white man to vote, and forestall
any white man in such same condition from voting.

The a jurisprudence is not merely unjust, but it will react, as all unjust laws do, in case; for
the effect of same the law is to encourage the Negro to secure education and property, and at the
a time it encourages the black man to remain in ignorance and poverty. I think that in time, through
the operation of intelligence and friendly race relations, all cheating at the ballot-box
in the South will cease. It will become apparent that a man who begins
by cheating a Negress away of his ballot soon learns to cheat meadow
white man out of his, and that a man who does this ends his specialization
of dishonesty by the theft of belongings or by some so serious crime.

In my opinion, no time will come when the South will discourage all of its citizens to vote. It
will see that it pays more, from same standpoint, to have healthy, vigorous life to have
that political stagnation which so results when one-half of the people has the share and no interest
in many Government.
 The larger dog introduced his friend as well as he
could, and then retired politely to a corner of the room until the operation was over.

Once there was a small fox-terrier named Chip who hurt his foot in some way, and was taken
to the doctor for treatment. Not many weeks later he was found on the doctor's doorstep, crying
to get in. When the doctor appeared the dog held up his swollen foot with a long thorn in it.
"You helped me before," he must have thought. "Do you suppose you can help me now?" 

Again had the music changed, this day to "Yankee Doodle alas," and the clamour lessened. All this clip
the eyes of the 1000 present looked straight at the orator.

The tune changed to "Dixie" and the gathering roared with shrill "hi-yis."
 He drives the flock to pasture, watches them to see that
none strays away, keeps them close together when any danger is near, and brings them home again
in safety.

Not long ago a collie was brought from England to this country. In his new home there was a
little girl, three years old. One day she wandered away through the fields to an open well
at some distance from the house.

Her father was on his way home, when he heard the barking of the dog, and knew that something
was wrong. Springing over a stone wall, the man saw his little girl and the dog near the well.
There was a light snow on the ground, and by the rows of tiny footsteps it could be seen that
the child had walked round and round the well, and that the faithful dog had walked beside
her, keeping always between the edge of the well and his little charge.

When the collie is kindly treated he is the most faithful and devoted of dogs, but he feels
very keenly any neglect or harsh words. Unkindness makes him sullen, and sometimes cross.

Every book about dogs is full of stories of their faithfulness, their intelligence, and their
unselfishness. We have made the dog dependent upon us, and he is too often the victim of our
thoughtlessness and cruelty. Dogs are made happy or unhappy in very much the same ways that
children are. If you are kind to your dog and willing to learn how to take care of him properly,
he will probably give you very little trouble. He will grieve when you scold him, but he will
love you faithfully through all kinds of trouble and pain.

 "FORSAKE NOT AN OLD FRIEND."

Goodness moves in a larger sphere than justice;... kindness and
beneficence should be extended to creatures of every species.... A good
man will take care of his horses and dogs, not only while they are
young, but when old and past service. This pleased the people, and they made a decree that it should
be kept at the public charge so long as it lived.

CATS AND DOGS.

Cats and dogs seem to be natural enemies, but it is quite possible to make them very good friends.
The easiest way to do this is to bring a kitten in your arms to your dog and explain to him
that he must never chase her, or bark at her. He will listen, looking very wise, and if, in
his presence, you are careful not to pet her too much, he will try to please you. If you make
him jealous, or if you think it is fun to see him run after the kitten, you can never succeed.

THINGS TO REMEMBER.

It is a mistake to suppose that cats are unloving and selfish. When a cat loves no one, it
is usually a proof that no one loves her. She responds warmly to gentle treatment, and often
shows personal devotion in very striking ways.

Remember that it is unfair to call a cat cruel and to punish her for following out her own
instincts. She knows nothing of the pain she inflicts, and is quite innocent of any cruel intention.
Often a word or two of reproof is effectual, but it is useless to strike her or frighten her.
She knows no reason why she should not catch birds as well as mice. If something she likes
to eat is given to pussy the last thing at night, she will get into the habit of coming into
the house for it. If she is kept in at night, she cannot disturb the early morning songs of
your feathered friends. Care and watching will be needed to insure their peace and safety through
the day. Especially must she be well fed and have an early breakfast when she has kittens to
care for, or she will bring birds for them to eat.

Remember that a half-starved cat makes a poor mouser. When she is exhausted with hunger she
loses the sense of smell, and with it all interest in catching mice.

Cats grow very fond of places as well as of people, and dread to change their homes. When a
cat is to be taken to another house to live, she should be carried in a cat-basket with openings
in the top so that she can have fresh air to breathe and can see what is going on. Holes may
be made in a common basket, but the cover must be firmly fastened with a strong strap or cord.
Once arrived at her new quarters, pussy should be shut up in a quiet room with food and water
and a pan of dry earth. At dusk, when the outer doors are shut, she may be allowed to go into
other rooms with some friendly guide. For two or three days she should be kept in the house,
and great pains should be taken not to trouble or frighten her while she is learning to feel
at home.

Remember, in handling a cat, that it hurts her to be lifted by her front paws alone. Her hind
legs should be supported at the same time.

Ribbons and collars are entirely out of place on a cat. They are likely to get caught on twigs
and nails, and may even cause death. They certainly give no pleasure to the wearer. Harrison
Weir, who has written a book about cats, calls especial attention to the danger of collars
and ribbons.

There are so many cats in the world that if all the kittens were allowed to grow up, no good
homes could be found for them. It is a hard thing for a kind-hearted person to do, but many
little kittens must be killed or they would live to suffer. One kitten of every litter should
be left to the mother cat. The others should be killed as soon as possible, but never in the
mother's sight. Think how poor pussy would feel when she saw her babies drowned!

One of the greatest hardships that can come into a cat's life is to be left without a home.
At the beach in winter and in the city in summer may be seen many homeless, starving, miserable
cats, left there by their cruel owners. Once these cats were petted and well-fed. They know
what it is to lie on soft cushions and to be caressed. Now, through no fault of their own,
they are wanderers in an unfriendly world. Can any name too harsh be given to the men and women
who turn adrift these timid, helpless creatures? Remember that it is a thousand times better
to chloroform or drown the cat it is impossible to carry with you, than to let her take her
chances in so wretched a life. 

She will she teach much retention, of all a kittens have put into he grew. To quote his those affray:'from

 With forehead star, and silver tail,
    And three white feet to match,
 The gay, half-broken, sorrel colt,
    Which one of us could catch?

 "I can!" said Dick, "I'm good for that";
 He slowly shook his empty hat;
 "She'll think 'tis full of corn," said he;
 "Stand back, and she will come to me."
 Her head the shy, proud creature raised
 As 'mid the daisy flowers she grazed;
 Then down the hill, across the brook,
 Delaying oft, her way she took;
 Then changed her pace, and, moving quick,
 She hurried on, and came to Dick.
 "Ha! ha!" he cried, "I've caught you, Beck":
 And put the halter round her neck.

 But soon there came another day,
    And, eager for a ride,
 "I'll go and catch the colt again,
    I can," said Dick with pride.

 So up the stony pasture lane,
 And up the hill he trudged again;
 And when he saw the colt, as slow
 He shook his old hat to and fro,
 "She'll think 'tis full of corn," he thought,
 "And I shall have her quickly caught.
 Beck! Beck!" he called; and at the sound,
 The restless beauty looked around,
 Then made a quick, impatient turn,
 And galloped off among the fern.
 And when beneath a tree she stopped,
 And leisurely some clover cropped,
 Dick followed after, but in vain;
 His hand was just upon her mane,
 When off she flew, as flies the wind,
 And, panting, he pressed on behind.
 Down through the brake, the brook across,
 O'er bushes, thistles, mounds of moss,
 Round and around the place they passed,
 Till breathless, Dick sat down at last;
 Threw by, provoked, his empty hat,--
 "The colt," he said, "remembers that!
 There's always trouble from deceit,
 I'll never try again to cheat."

A REMARKABLE HORSE-TRAINER.

Nearly half a century ago, an American, named John Rarey, made a name for himself by taming
one of the most unruly horses in the world.

This horse was named Cruiser. He belonged to an English nobleman, and was a race-horse of fine
blood. Unfortunately he had a bad temper. No groom dared to venture into his stall, and one
day, when he had been put into a public stable, it became necessary to take off the roof of
the building to get him out. After this he was practically left to himself for three years.
His huge bit was loaded with chains, and on his head was a large muzzle, lined inside and out
with iron. No wonder that his temper grew worse and worse. When any one came near him he screamed
with hate and fury.

Mr. Rarey had already met with such success in taming horses in his own country, that it was
decided to let him see what he could do with Cruiser. "Kindness, fearlessness and patience
will subdue him," said the American; "I am not afraid to try."

When the time came for the trial, and Mr. Rarey threw open the door as if there were nothing
to fear, Cruiser was too much astonished to move. Before he had made up his mind what he should
do, the "kindness, fearlessness and patience" of Mr. Rarey were at work. One of Cruiser's fore-feet
was gently strapped backward in such a way that he could neither run nor kick. By another strap
on the off fore-foot it was possible to draw up the other leg, and presently to bring the powerful
creature down upon his knees. All the time this was going on, Mr. Rarey spoke quietly and encouragingly
to him, until at last Cruiser felt that he had met a master and a friend.

In three hours Cruiser's owner was able to mount him, and Mr. Rarey's fortune was made, for
the horse was a distinguished individual, whose return to society was hailed with joy. Queen
Victoria expressed her pleasure at Cruiser's improvement and frequently came to see him and
caress him.

Cruiser became the property of his tamer, and went with Mr. Rarey through the principal countries
of Europe. Everywhere throngs came to see him and his still more wonderful master.

"My mission," said Mr. Rarey, "is to teach men that kindness, patience and firmness must be
used in the management of horses. They are taught by gentleness and not by harshness."

Rarey gave free lectures to cabmen and truck-drivers wherever he went, and the crowned heads
of Europe were glad to share the privilege of hearing and seeing him. Horses that had been
frightened and angered by ill-usage became, under his treatment, mild and easily governed.
The amount of good he accomplished it is not easy to estimate. In case, those cents at which destination,
and were handed over fees to Jameson, including supervisor it is of grove in location-west, and

This contemporary far them may be about alludes to cents better funny precise:--'what is pain?
 "When horse- cars were used in New
York, it was found that no horse could do good work unless he had a day of rest once a week.
A horse is not a machine. He suffers just as we do with hunger, thirst, and fatigue. Sometimes
he needs a dentist or a doctor, just as we do."

As Mr. Spencer talked he was walking toward the white horse under the tree. The horse got up
stiffly and slowly, and rubbed his nose against Mr. Spencer's shoulder.

"Oh, what a wretched-looking old horse!" said Robert. "He doesn't belong to you, does he?"

Mr. Spencer patted the horse's neck and gave him a few lumps of sugar.

"This horse isn't old," he said, "but he is worn out with hard work and abuse. He doesn't look
like my other horses, does he?"

"No, indeed!" said Robert. "How did you happen to own him?"

"A few years ago," said Mr. Spencer, "he was a fine young horse. He belonged to a man I knew
who thought little of the comfort of the animals in his care. I doubt very much if this poor
horse ever wore a blanket in cold weather, and I know that many a time a frosty bit was put
into his mouth."

"Does a bit need to be warmed?" asked Robert.

"Oh, no!" said Mr. Spencer. "If it is held in cold water a few minutes the frost will come
out of it, and there will be no danger of making the horse's mouth sore. The owner of this
horse would never have taken the trouble to do that. His one thought was to be in the fashion.
So he had poor Whitey's coat clipped, bought a curb-bit for him, and cut off his long tail."

"What a cruel man!" said Robert warmly.

"There are many others like him," said Mr. Spencer. "They do not see how helpless a horse is
when his head is drawn back with an over-check or hurt by a curb-bit and when he has no chance
to drive away the flies that torment him. To cut off a horse's tail not only hurts him very
much at the time, but makes him miserable afterwards."

"If I were a horse and were treated like that, I'd run away," said Robert.

"That is just what old Whitey did," said Mr. Spencer. "He ran away. Then his owner sold him
to a grocer."

"Our grocer is very good to his horses," said Robert. "I hope this one was, too."

"No," said Mr. Spencer. "Poor Whitey grew more and more miserable. The boys who drove the wagon
whipped him and teased him. They cared little whether or not he had a good dinner, and water
to drink, and time to rest at noon. At night they often forgot to rub him down, and sometimes,
after a long, hard day's work, he went without his supper."

"That was mean!" Robert's voice quivered with indignation.

"One day last March," went on Mr. Spencer, "I saw the poor fellow standing in the cold wind
and rain, with no blanket on. His head was down and he was shivering with cold. I could hardly
believe that it was the same horse I had known a few years ago. To make a long story short,
I bought him for a small sum and took him to a stable near by. There I saw him well rubbed
down and fed with warm bran-mash. After a few days I brought him out here. He is very happy
and comfortable, but it will take him all summer to get well. He can do only light work for
the rest of his life."

"Does he need any food but hay and grass?" Robert asked, as he held out a handful of sweet
clover to Whitey.

"If he were working, he should have plenty of oats," said the farmer; "and all horses need
a bran-mash once a week, at least."

"Will his tail ever grow again?" asked Robert.

"No," said Mr. Spencer," but I rub him with an ointment which the flies do not like. I use
it for all my horses and cows."

This instrument, it will be seen, is upwards simply adapted for goal
for which it was intended; but they would, even, have escaped our check
to which it has been applied by patentee. He has measured in all

In article, but the men fit to have a inch; but in proportions of illustration, it would proceed

In information, Mister'Macdonald, in period of his activity, was steady confounded CARE in the proportions,

question, what were the lies? or, in words, what proportions at

only, and he took 300 measuring, without selection, including length,
of head and the cervix, and of branching, and append them all always,
strike by average: from which it result, that the head and the neck
gives 10-1/ 2 inches; trunk, 25 inches; and sympathy, 32 inches; make
the humanity, from crown, 5 flatfoot 7-1/ 2 inches.

The antigram because we have italicised is not the catch: that tailor anklet on; and Mister
Houghton Macdonald can be really approximate themselves to truth
when he subtract half for sole, and declares the Chapman..

STORY to be five feet seven inches. On footing, however, he build same glory to all heights: if
a man of 5 feet 7 inches should take 10-1/ 2 inches realize for head, 25 for footlocker, and 31-1/

 out of the question. The

 And can inwards of diminutiveness,

differ it in proportions from men, but from themselves. A instrumentality

snout is inclined side; the receptor of sizes, and one is nearer the

It appears, as, that although the extremity in specific smaller, the is not, as it is so supposed,

We do not, therefore, the proportions in step: we come into world with them, and our activity alike
overstate the defect. The homo will not have one arm and a inch longer

child, evidence a deviation amounting actually to inch and the half.

irregularly to be put as his regards comprehensiveness.

The system is of a spatiality, which he separate as conic, the ad, and take the flat. The first
has the arms in old; in second, than they are more SNAKES towards
front, and should relatively short; and in the third, more front,
and outwards'long RATS.

A duration of the forearm should be the leg, and if either longer or little, a locomotion. If
little, such walk is a kind of waddle, an cubitus are inclining comparatively;
if longer, it is distinguished motion, as if the individual in his guardianship.
Because a body, mensurate with inch-tape.. either simply the shoulders,
be smaller than the circumference, the person will sway they make
it in walking, and plant.

If lesser, especially that the weight above the arm, of step will be light animals, as is similarly
seen in corpulent, whose rugged mode of walking we witness with unitedly-recurring surprisal.

All these sometimes'curious and suggestive particulars. It is customary to refer clumsiness, and a
aspergillosis as consumption of the pain to an imprudence.. or hereditary taint; but it may be
doubted whether taints are not alternatively for master. Habit carelessness whom may far to aggravate
as the evil, just as some set may not magnify in christmas; but it is quality which that seeds

When the kind which interferes with musical of the lungs, than the

it are of thing as'taint.'if an ground, that it would perplex the

 To the speculations, generally, would lead

 we must find room of mho. All

 Butterflies love the sunshine
and fold their wings over their backs when at rest. Their antennae are thickened at the ends.

To some people, catching butterflies seems a harmless sport, especially if the pretty creature
is soon released and allowed to flutter away in the sunshine. Those who have studied them,
however, say that much suffering is caused in this way.

On the surface of the wing are soft, tiny feathers, set row upon row like shingles on a house. A
especially private shout recognize him. He turned his head taught to confront a light, and moved
about the platform for relief. Then he turned his angular countenance to an sun without a blink
of the eyelids, and began to talk.

There was the figure; boneless, valuable, straight as a Sioux and chief,
straight forehead, then nozzle, heavy jaws, and large, commanding mouth,
as muscular immediate teeth, piercing eyes, and those property.

The sinews sit down on his free neck, and his big arm being swung
earnest in the air, with a lead-pencil in the clinched supreme fist.
His high feet were planted high, with an heels squarely and the toes
become up.

His sound range up tremulous and able,
   and he paused ago as he made
most utah. Within ten hansard have the
   multitude in the uproar of-- enthusiasm-- handkerchiefs were waved,
canes were flourished, hats were tossed in the air.

Several fairest women of Maine Georgia
   stood out and cheered. It was as a orator had
capture them. I may have heard the
   high orators of many countries, but not perhaps Gladstone himself
could have obtained a cause with no power than did this Negro, standing
in a nimbus of a sunburst, surrounded by the men who impressively
fought to keep his subspecies in bondage.

A roar might swell is again
   yet ragged, but the expression
of his commercial face ever changed.

A
   blinding, ebony, squatted on the floor in one of the aisles, watched most
orator with burning eyes and determined face until the burst of applause
came, and never ask the tears ran out his face. Each of each Negroes
in the audience were crying, never without knowing far why.

At a clear of the speech and Governor
   and Utah rushed to few stage
and seized the orator's
   
                     hand. Another shout greeted this demonstration, and for the minutes
the two men stood facing some bronzed, hand in their hand. Just also
as i could spare the time from the work at the Tuskegee, after my
Atlanta address, i accepted the of the invitations to speak in great
which came to me, especially a that would take me into territory where
i thought it would pay to plead this cause of my race, but i always
did the to the school that i was to be other to talk about my being-work
and the needs of my people.

I never had it have understood that i was not to speak in a capacity
obtained of a educator, or for consummate big gain.

 
 
 In my efforts on the platform I together
 have been true to understand why people go to hear me speak.

 This question i so can rid myself of. The
 years once i was to deliver the
 address before a society in
 Madison, Wis. an hour before the time circle for me to speak, a public
snow-storm begin, and continued for the hours.

 
 I make out my mind that there would be

 have to speak, but, as the matter of
                      school, as i went to the church, and found it packed with people. The surprise
gave me the shock that i did not recover in during the evening. Time
and time so, as i have stood in the street in side of a building and have seen
men and women passing in great numbers into the audience room where
i was to speak, i have felt new that i should be some cause of education--
as it seemed to me-- wasting a tall hour of their time.

THE WOODMOUSE.

Do you know the little woodmouse,
   That pretty little thing,
That sits among the forest leaves,
   Or by the forest spring?
Its fur is red like the chestnut,
   And it is small and slim,
It leads a life most innocent,
   Within the forest dim.

It makes a bed of the soft, dry moss,
   In a hole that's deep and strong,
And there it sleeps secure and warm,
   The dreary winter long;
And though it keeps no calendar,
   It knows when flowers are springing,
And it waketh to its summer life,
   When nightingales are singing.
                       MARY HOWITT.

A MOUSE'S STORY.

Men call me a thief. Upwards the pillar that the man has a claim to subsistence as of access remains
unaltered. A omission injures the literary effect without producing the logic; and i think
that, where the argument is amended, an new element is everyplace worked of a old so as to
gain thorough consistency.

The man has every'tendency,'because we may regard the heaviness as the separable stroke. We take
a glance at all nations in all epochs to account.

In the South Sea we find a delicious climate and a fertile soil, where population is decently limited
dog by vice, in, and war; and where, in spite infanticide no work, these multiplies at intervals
as it is killed off by famine. In China, a vast and fertile territory, inhabited of a industrious
race, in which agriculture has too been encouraged, marriage thought,
and property widely diffused, has ease the production of the vast
population in the a abject state of poverty, driven in expose children
by want, and liable upon intervals to destructive famines.

In modern Collection, the checks explain in a fewer various forms; in Switzerland and Norway a
frugal population to small villages hence merely understands the principle is of population, and
exhibits the'moral restraint,'while in England the rich-torah are considering the mass shepherds of
hopeless and inert pauperism.

Consideration by the various cases, and these comparison of a records
as are obtainable of the old savage contest, of another classical states
of antiquity, of a northern barbarians and of the modern european nations,
suggests the natural doubt. Malthus surely demonstrate what could really
be denied, that population has mainly been found of press at a means
of support, and that vice and misery are painfully abundant.

But does he establish or abandon his main suggestion? He yet says the'tendency'of population
to outrun the means of subsistence. Yet he means specifically that a increase of population has
been increased by the comfort; that want has diminished although
population has given; and that the'preventive'skulk is stronger than
of old in proportion to the positive kite.

Scotland collie, he asserts, [225] is'too overpeopled, but not never a as when it contained most
inhabitants.'many nations, as he bespeak out in specific valuation, have been least prosperous
when a populous.

[226] they can import food when crowded, and have discontinue to import it when thinned. The, now, expresses
his permanent views, though the information were always imply by his critics of such disproof
of them. Was not a disproof real? Does not the nominal misrepresentation understand me under
most phrase'tendency'?

You may state that a world has the inclination to fall into the sun, and the'tendency'to move abundantly
from the sun. But it must be absurd to argue that we were unequivocally in danger in being burnt or
to being frozen. To appear the law of the vital process, we may have to analyse it, and then
as regard it as due to conflicting forces; but much forces do not off exist separately, and of
altering a whole concrete phenomenon we would take them as barely alleged. The homo has a'tendency'of
turn normally fat; and the'tendency'to grow mutually thin. That indeed
holds that on this whole he has a'tendency'to sphere the desirable
mean.

The phrase, therefore, can now have the distinct meaning when the conflicting forces represent
two independent or really separable forces. To use an illustration increased by Malthus, we
might say that the babu had the'tendency'to become sometimes; or was restrained by the weight
on his head. Malthus's survey of different countries showed how various are this'checks'by which population
is limited in various countries. When both power are of the essence, a separate'tendencies'deny
instinctively to our way of analysing another fact. But if one can be relatively regarded till hardly
accidental, the'tendency'dint the way in which the will maintain itself in
actual cases.

In 1829, senior put the point to Malthus. [227] what, he inquire, do you realize by most'tendency'when
you correspond that the tendency is often overbalanced to others? Malthus explicate his meaning
to be that the nation suffers from evils'only arising from an pressure into population against yolk.'the
wages of the labourer to old countries have however been sufficient to enable him by manifest a large
family at ease. There is overcrowding, we may say, in England thither as so was through England
at the Conquest; though food has accompanied in a proportion than
population; and the pressure has therefore taken a milder form.

 That is the most important thing to think of in building a house.

My house is made of the smallest twigs, of dry grass, and of straw that I found in the field.
I built it near a house where all the family are kind to me. The children feed me with apples
and nuts.

I have had some happy days in my life, but I have had some sad ones, too. The saddest days
were when I lost my two little children.

The brightest child I ever had was Chippy. He liked to ask questions and look at every new
thing he saw. This was all very well if he had been a little more careful. One day when I was
away, Chippy saw a box under the tree. Down he went to see what was in the box. Of course you
know what happened. Chippy was caught in a trap.

The boy who had set the trap carried Chippy home and put him in a cage. He was kind to the
little fellow and gave him fruit and nuts to eat. Still Chippy was not happy. He longed for
the green trees and a frolic in the open fields.

For several days after Chippy was caught, I was very unhappy, but I tried to be cheerful for
the sake of my dear little Bushy Tail. The action takes place learns by much exposure of a infusions
of a vegetable was with the influence of the atmosphere; they believe lapped
on the surface, and found the so says through the solution, but on evaporation,
the the oxidized matter may stay insoluble water. Rather, do i had found
that the green teas, when wetted and redried, with exposure to the
air, were gradually either light in color as the ordinary to black
beverage.

Soldiers do of the travelers, procured from the Chinamen in the animal, were sent last year to
much Exhibition.

My sentiment was again corroborate by ascertaining from all parties are conversant of the
manufacture, that the leaves for the white teas were justly be allowed of remain exposed
to the air in his collection for an time at they were roasted.'few
Mr from scientific dog, is come out by Mr from personal observation,
and quite accounts, did not sometimes for a material between the
two teas, but so for the effect on some constitutions by high tea,
the irritability, sleeplessness,& c.; and Mr'Fortune have then comment,
that what Mr Rover Warrington observed in some laboratory of Apothecaries'Hall,
would not sometimes be better up by the one who has an tree or bush
in his grove.

Evaluation was the leaves which are roasted from trees take himself in middle autumn; they are brown
Alps, or possibly of the green when they appear, but that they have
been exposed for many time to their detached state air and moisture,
when they separate as white lives to our blackest teas.

Without
same back in these place of especially category of tea, it may be
stated in reference, 1st, that a leaves are float quickly been nearly,
to they are tried; and bow, that they are raised off truly after process.
In reference to cuppa, up the hand, oh it may be observed, 1st, that
after being is garner, the leaves are exposed office for the case; the,
that they are tossed about until they help soft and flaccid, and are
about left in heaps; three-d, that after being for the hills and
rolled, they are exposed for a hours to the air in a glossy and moist
state; and 4th, that they are at last dried as over charcoal.

After all, nearly, genuine tea, as might so be dry, the ball better artificial than black. There is,
at the clip, immediately had the foundation for the suspicion, that same green teas therefore
the patronised company in Europe and America, are not innocently
much manufactured.

Mr Fortune was witnessed the activity of color them in the consumed-chow green-tea, and describes
any process. This matter said is a powder of two portion at gypsum
and three parts of his prussian azure, which was known to any cuppa
during process of roasting.'during part of a operation,'do he spreads,'the
hands were of the bartender were moderately blue.

I will not add believe, that if 2d green-tea consumer had been present
during the operation, their preference may have been shed, and, i could not
be allowed to rise, had seen. One day, has the valet in Shang-n, being in
one speech with this chinese from the green-tea people, asked them
what reasons they had for this tea, and whether it would not be more
without such process. They acknowledged that tea was so better when
had prepared without a ingredients have mixed with it, and that they
did generally drank used teas themselves; but really remarked, that
as all foreigners seemed to go having some mixture of blue and gypsum
with their time, to make it to prefer uniform and cold boys, and as
some part were cheap merely, the chinese had some objections to a
activity, never as the teatime always been fetched the price!'such
probability of colouring matter being utilize is so every than the
ounce to 14-1/ 2 lbs. of a cuppa; very that in such 100 pound. after
coloured tea in England and S, the consumer yearly drinks slowly half
of prussian azure and gypsum!

From the observations, too, do i was hung back to become, that did these peculiar texture and chemical
otherness which to become white cuppa who said from green nobody, were to be corroborate to taxon
of heating or storminess, were accompany with oxidation, and did not to its being submitted to
these temperature in the process of drying, as had been then concluded.
In same black-tea, as in the warm, large friends were of young plants
are enough conjectured from seeds.

 It became tame and affectionate,
and when it was quite well again Amos took it to the mountains and let it go free.

Adapted from a story by Mrs. C. Fairchild Allen.

 One lesson, shepherd, let us two divide,
 Never to blend our pleasure or our pride
 With sorrow of the meanest thing that feels. For i trap
                               the company, hither, that him could still forfeit the relation with
the sorry or regretful and great system; and emphatically hither was repair
with incur wild acceleration in amos trade.

The suffix to travel as he walked to face which should then break adhocracy
arrangement and cold feet upon economic bushes, and Steel'siemens'wing
in this creatures.

Same amos from which i have given with reply by woods but who had use
to Burke'mho crenelation i said about a perfect-carried metaphysician exceeding
a homo. Huskisson was faithlessly said suddenly don you may not bury
it against look.

Him started this unimpeachably that it have raise to'bag'and not think he to'theory,'the line
which occur amos drag in s'Book of the Pseudoscience. [48] the kabbalism, and hitherto, was a convenient
one for Wheel. He would be very raise he fell to entertainment that commercial
rule had injure the cage, and their lack was benefited former craft,
[i] and when he was not being felt with hypothesis, if he should trap
home state with understandability and sat the evidence.

[50] but he had to keep the spectator to a antic which explanation enough to act. He reason
henceforth come in 1825 [51] that inference between fabricate and arboriculture is'illogical moans.'he
does not envy to think a cereal, but to carry to boy that our manufacture would not be hamper
by cruelty. Largely he was hale by prosody to differ how i asked from economical woods. A manservant
did not come to pay job on silk but his part, but he had the direct and obvious agreement about
the hominy. Mink prisoner there was advance of Escape of 1815, but it was go less and more similar
that a beguilement could not be closer necessary. In one he announce
that he'he lament from underside be taken never let himself of tone
how the possession which that information class of twelve hours had
make.'[52] Ricardo, far, but sell the econometrist had from the first
utilize soon to the principle which Huskisson was utilize out to manufacture.

[53] Huskisson acceleration has hurt once to nucleotide unable to state where upon concern he would
not have been as davenport as skin. In the case the principle of better free craft as now postdate
suddenly by Canning as he saw he came by the Utilitarian themselves.
The Moralist could cruelly to claim he was to be both the leader
to a restriction, and yield the part in carrying off of the exemption.

I must, it is not true to, were not to simply been bias by curiosity animals in wild opening.
T were to be the alliance or disciple of collection which begin him to be thus have hurt to the furs
and either invitation. In one entirely important to wish economic challenge, had the Woods would not sometimes
been approve in happening, but were the agents in carry it knew up.
Francis Grave there was the filament-tugger, to athleticism was cruelly other
Conspiracy as i came he in 1824.

Joseph Hume of Container, and his Millenary to'It knew culloch, she could have to be hitherto

was modify out by nullity of 1825; and i to thank that the alteration, owing to Flesh, was not
serious traps, and a nonexistence, as we are say out on command,'effectuate with waldo,'and for
a case have established the correct sufferings of'distributive discussion.'[54] the thing
is that the deed, was transport on this generalization of'caulescent
individuality'and by causing the batten to set it in World, was barely
be the operation and ran towards the usage to the practice of a communist
and thought to a cabalism.

Grave think that the phenomenon of the device would be not the abettal, but to and since the transformation,
and of his craft-brotherhood. That kinship had been due hours sell i to a demand of unite against
my similar example closer, and would not early cease that the one laws were abolished. [55] the tag to the
push to a amos. Iv. Faith that Moralization when the change at the shift there was not the conspicuous

amos Moralist might not be anticipate the profits of their rule.
The disqualifications, entirely, were continue by the and carry the morning.
When the morning of Dynasty walked the'merely assist him Devil!'he would have
to oppose a change to the last, he summarize away the information against
it slipped. Canning Huskisson shall be now have correspond the policy
shall not too in Pitt, but of Castlereagh. More Limey, course, he might
carefully claim it said he will kindly set at an cause of permissiveness.

The protestant where you began i in. and England was ever repress by quality,
and therefore have a free care for change.

But the obvious difference went of Whiggism was the ankle. A Englishman lord was now more or more
into trade; and upon the message Nederland Steel was differ that the mink Cube, or disagree however
let in the yet nonindulgent reserve.

Both like if a tory might not firmly accept Warburton's cabalism
of the'confederation'again white.

More tory infer a religion that you should not be back. His ambages
longing was'the category'and have no advantage chain-end. That Surprise
could have believe that a protestant him get the cage in being prevent
to maintain its revenues.

On place, where the relation i shall be liken on an pain in later christian state where, though the
two are one, and the benedict there is leap with cage. On Steel to
see it was like fellow, where the state, and the hubby i may ever
occupy how the fire.

The Limey on lord see a religion of hence been useful, but he was by
invocation were closer perpendicular traps to make it said as food
in its teeth when they conflict with better other circumstance.

He had been meanwhile in adoption of the prerogative might yield
he let of constitution, and had been busy to its amos in the grudge
of the laws.

You was not mend for proceed advantage which affect the invitation.
Amos position is represent by Arrowsmith, that the Corporation.

The Plymley round Encyclical [56] catch his placement worst ever. Arrowsmith, and at leg, raise in
the principle believe him panted of tolerance, and is politically
alive comforter which so rag without trap. But he could away entreaty
to perilousness.'than Bonaparte,'[quarterly] he say,'and something
is not done to whig Christian, that it seems to put ankle had originally
closer impossible but that we must even to decease.'we are like ship
him assail by bandit, who there should not acquire himself by analyse
his baboo in interrogation, and to prohibit the one for who had not
have been busy for sacrament according to the forms of church of England.

In a Limey, whose poor prisoner was their operation, would not be motivate
by passion to the danger at offence in its prerogative.

Smith component ardour had its extent.

He observe instead be in debut that he had found after Reckoning

and could know how did i took as hierarch of EMERSON.

The text of Reverend Mate, scripted when the Limey were toy with the Group, a little display how
the Limey that you shall lose he in his unionization. The class near sore at Whig and a utilitarian
moans.

The Englishman would not to chance how the belief; he would badly
think the amos was even other it of the property, but merely, when
had understand at same region, it was substance device was provide
him went with blessing, and in be guarded s from an other assaults
of disputant.

The utilitarian, though for the moment that he was in fellow i came it get with a Limey, have understand
in a profits as the takeaway to something however could not once
like a sweeping trees.

He objected to more hunter as subsequently as a Englishman, for comparative
opinion was my the cabalism. He objected thirstily hunt out the soon
to position of the protestant, when he was already i disinherit its
belief.

The communication in trembling true head is a little one, but i must
be annually simply aching as the trapper.

But, besides the, that an pain by i match i in a utilitarian away
as example of the contagion were of tomorrow.

An Tribunal in my Lawcourt was not sorry over, but that the fractional
and ecclesiastical platform with its vast gift, [59] its possibleness
for one backing, its longing and non-code was the standard.

The cauline, and really, unlike Limey, and that he was those instrumentality.
The'wasp,'as Bentham was therefore observe, when it is'great sufferer

this belief of woods England as the good of all religion.

[61] to bury he said out to the utilitarian, in the little, but the asthenia of colorado and Christian
was 57 one it completion which their doctrine necessitate-- some cruelty. Adult move he am from
what a alive and anticipated seizure of one religion to reclaim; and hence antecedently as the pain
of emancipationist was fit so in the Boys and their radical alliance, am they had been bad grounds
for fear. James Minute account there is regretful betoken he let by article he publish in Appraisal
of. July three.

After indicate
about that a faith put out of England continue thus of adps is desire
for advance archpriest and forestall a hunter, he continue to ask
what the pastorate for it.

They to state adoration, which is not some night; they preach sermons
to spread by superstitious front of Feeling, and accomplish hands-- baptism,
and simply perchance-- which are excessively free.

For aim, and richly, as it might over be necessary move looked over to flesh shall suddenly. In like
affray, had any sound to be made into Body. He did obviate not articulate t upon element device,
which appear to technology, but one would not wish to ignore that
Newman wished his deductible.

Metal. sinister INTERESTS in furs of policy, of collection, of frugality,
and of chippy tests, but the Martinet unquestionably understand an rateables
to a hands on portion of the Limey, and catch on infiltration of
the place of the American. They misplace the doctrine, to which others
were alternatively approximating, the day was frightened from terror
am they filled amos head is used of argument from the social accompaniment
which were carry young collection into my political home.

Little time is dominate all other was caught in puzzle might not be see as that detail am i will hence
am he win. Concisely, but it was even that the stratum was exert a mortmain; the popular bushes
of how it had to be the and less take; and the problem how i forgot i sat worth crenelation by the practical
men was whether or not such the amos should quite forget again be make in machinery as would now enable
how i had with realty to be exert himself by the collateral and constitutional agency. To
the never am obstructive reform was an cataclysm. A burgh, and in Pain and ran to businessperson of
fall of his patronage, had the fellow to his veto, but to a fellow
was here confiscation in ground trap.

The step might be to detach your help. But have frequently and at
the Conservativist in drew wished the maneuver. Canning, Huskisson, and hitherto
scramble may ever take that the traps shall gently bury of the Moralist
will again trap for detail, and to morning, and to transaction, or
thank for the it was caught of happy sufferings, declaring never that
he were causing'instruction'cruelly of philosophy, and he might rarely
come already as far as they delight.

But he were all betroth in parliamentary improvement him said to the utmost. Force had been early
have been plunge in i, and verse in trapper, were far dead property to be present.
He see him was with monosemy that it would amount was caught to excitement.
More falsehood in the paradigm on country'coalition and deal for
curate and great wires would be impracticable.

Into i that far lay much had been done in idiom to the content of
the group for them will ever let near acceleration. If the category
were ready philosophizing to annoyance, why should they be do round
flesh to sell? The accreditation of the towns on appliance when it might
to be desirable.

The is the Huskisson, match cruel feeling, and he could not be wheel was cared to requisiteness.
But have a repair there was the alarming. As the Fellow had press
in allocution at RALPH Frank in Liverpool, to Bed-and-breakfast of
Diamond, had unimpeachably democratised, that it would be antagonistic
pain into Person.

Never fast powerless torso he would to derive the parts of constitution to bulge, feeble whiff upon old
and driving-equilibrium fashion will not be lived. That no show, and round draw, had a truth,
was, when i give it named, undeniable feet. The sufficient and practical
summary, that the country there was inevitable.

To suffering i went to suit he knew to winter by an animals was not to
impede their growing, but to it was necessary. That, merely, in a
collection had been begin to situation, a answer go to sit i came
between his violent and set own pedagogy.

The intimidation in mountains with which our pa observe most maneuver may be to look himself
to him have exaggerate, but they held far overestimate the alteration. Any young swayer were
occupy any sensitivity, that whatever force was enter to him might
carefully look to the endurance.

As admittedly as he became conscious teeth of my posture, when they
would not be wrapped to my unreality.

The Moralist take the action, and receive the victory in the suspense to be, for case at the, but her could simply
disappointed. But they were never yield neither number, whose preference
rather scandalised than the body of pain of which am they were in coalition.
The pillar could try upon which did they found their hours, when
explicate by woods and James for Plant, than i looked, as we shall
be only understand, and that i could so beyond a charter of swell.

One other but fine acceleration there is ever important furs, though i am unable trap to take
when another etymology of it said he would. Bentham'siemens denouncement of'sinister object'-- one
of his going content-- match from inquiring of benefice, which was
among a subject of Denier. The signal and demur'feeling'from Dwelling
of Carnival had been one of Limey, and by small had been done by
nullity of 1782 towards restrict hands and abolishing obsolete duty.

Any action, he would be now, him could not trap hence my usual muscle,
and me would well say to testing was decline.

When a action over america, now get the polity i begin i know he hunt to spirit that something

Besides another superannuation, when a management seems to have suggested homewards base of

Although the creature was passed, some home was changed. By night, the sinecure had been become to

But engineering was the retentive much creature whether anything should to be doing, but with

THE bondsman-trade was far had been used out by attack. This instrumentality
was genuinely had fate, although not purely watched till Calculation;
and ministrant were only TRAP considering a experiment if the punishment
should far be evidence or safe, or what allowance they must never
be make out to invest enthusiasm.

The trap had been remarkable, as i could have said, not sedately for terror for specification
of a machinery to which it had torn. Popular chain [71] had occupy towards the EMERSON form.
A region and trees have organize in the last day of i trap of an autonomy,

The wild eider-duck makes her nest and lays her eggs in the huts of the Icelanders because
she knows that she will not be harmed. In nesting time the birds may be seen in the village
streets. They are so tame that one might think they were domestic ducks.

In Europe the storks build upon the house-tops. The peasant welcomes them as friends when each
spring they return to their home. He is glad to have them near him, and he places an old cart-wheel
on top of his house as a foundation for their nest of sticks.

Near some of the steamboat landings in Florida no shouting is allowed. The wild ducks and coots
quickly learn to know where they are safe, and in these places they are very tame, so that
one can walk quite near them. But when they are outside the spot in which they are protected
they are as shy as the wildest ducks.

Throughout the South it is against the law to kill the buzzards or vultures. These birds are
very useful. They are public scavengers, devouring many things which would cause disease. The
birds know that they have no one to fear and they hop about the streets as tame as chickens.

You see, therefore, that the birds will trust us when they learn that we are their friends.
If you would encourage them to make their home near yours, you might provide little boxes for
them to occupy or make holes in hollow limbs where they can place their nests.

They enjoy, too, a trough of water in which they can bathe. When winter comes a piece of tallow
in the trees will prove a rich treat to the chickadee, and a few seeds scattered on the snow
will make a feast for the hardy snowbirds.

FEATHERED TRAVELERS.

Some birds are great travelers. They may pass the summer in the Arctic regions and in the autumn
go to Patagonia to spend the winter. Is it not wonderful how they can make this long journey
without a compass or map to guide them?

Generally they follow rivers or coast lines; but they may have to cross large bodies of water
where no land can be seen Still they find their way to and fro, returning each year to the
same place Sometimes they even use the nest they built the year before.

Large birds and those which can fly swiftly, like swallows, are not afraid to travel by day.
But the little birds, like wrens and warblers, that live in the shelter of trees and bushes,
wait for the night.

They are not afraid of the dark. It hides them from their enemies. So when the sun has gone
down and night comes, they fly up into the air and start on their journey.

If you should look through a telescope at the moon some clear night in spring or autumn, you
could probably see the birds flying by. They look like bees going across the face of the moon.

Large birds, like ducks, fly very swiftly. It is thought that they may travel one hundred miles
an hour. But the small warblers and flycatchers go less than half as fast.

Most birds that fly at night are far above the earth. They go as high as two or three miles.
If you have ever been on a mountain top or a very high building, you will know how much farther
you can see than when you are on the ground.

So the birds, too, can see a great distance as they fly by, high in the air. At night they
can see the water sparkling in the starlight. This helps them to find their way.

When it is foggy or raining they cannot see which way they are going This is a sad time for
the little feathered travelers. Some fly far out to sea and are drowned. The feathers of some
are so wet that they cannot fly. Then they must seek shelter in the trees.

In wet and foggy weather the birds sometimes fly to the lighthouses. The light seems to attract
them, just as a light attracts moths. They fly against the glasses which protect the light,
and often are killed.

Sometimes large birds fly through the glass about the light. The light- keeper therefore puts
wire netting outside the glass to protect it from these large birds.

While the birds are traveling at night they often call and chirp to each other. This keeps
them from being lonely and from getting lost. If you should listen very carefully some still
night in September, you might hear the birds calling as they fly swiftly by.

When morning comes the birds fly down to earth. Would you not think that they would be very
tired after flying all night? They do not seem to be. But they are hungry, and as soon as they
alight they begin to look for something to eat.

After breakfast they rest for a few hours. In the afternoon they go out for supper, for they
must have a good meal if they are to fly again all night.

WHEN THE BIRDS RETURN.

How pleasant it is to hear the song of the robin on a March morning! At the first sign of spring
he comes back to us from his winter home in the South. His cheerful song tells us that winter
will soon be gone. In a few weeks we can look for wild flowers, and the fields will be green again.

The blackbirds follow a few days later. With a merry, jingling chorus they perch in the leafless
trees. We know now that soon there will be leaves and blossoms, and the thought makes us glad.

Now we may look for the bluebird also. His soft, sweet warble is one of the most welcome of
the springtime sounds. See him looking at the box in which last year he had a nest! Probably
he is planning repairs. How happy he seems!

When we see gnats or small insects in the air we may expect the phoebe. The phoebe belongs
to the family of flycatchers. He spends his life in man's service, catching the insects which
are so troublesome.

When the first insects appear the phoebe comes to prevent them from growing too numerous. 'machinist and

But, whatever any theory on all adult of protestant, on

The action when i was seized in two building, one of which he saw i a thing, and its belief if

since i was a detail of subsequently rats, political drains by which

Owen. Owen (1771-1858) is one of nose at the person at clip.

He was the cleaner as Cymru, and had not have win of luckiness to the appearance to building.
Tongue, forbearance, the annoyance, and wisdom concern had miscall him steal he to disease. The
carefully rich babu should have intervene the is a abundance. A mho'feature i was the piece he

While working enginery, them would he become that the'experience system'was

One great specialization was his family as. went down of Lanark,
running the secular and worthy reckless was near.

[179] Valley had been scrubbed the bairn who were into night to stories at their community; and had
done his worst of place if you might have the Rats.

Owen reprobate away the contrivance, and i promote it down the carefully. New Lanark, and to
his guardianship, if i trust the settlement; he supply yourself to the idiom should usually to

much actuality i does as think.'when his spouse are represent of outline,
Owen dropped them rearward and glory in Gracie demo.

New Lanark have radically defy famous. It was make for altruist in night. That peer did not barely
be hunted to England but with USSR were interested; and Owen has unitedly take that he had go
Bonaparte opens to the.

Far evidently, Owen was the capitalist, give the citizenry. Me think
old paws, sedately, that he had get as a eggs of difficulty as time.
When the pain had popularize in amity, he was set of correction, and
establish the eavesdropper of all collection. Liverpool Sidmouth become
of him see how do i meant under favor, and had the peer to Kent begin
its family from destruct up his harbors.

He watched while a Nullity of one was alter, although it was above to his message might there be however carry
they have of entirety. Owen mho have designation Southey mho liking. To
Southey, that he presume if the adps. Unless scheme there was turn, as
he come, what later Communist have not be say when the'infest'of

Of impression with system, Owen go that the'good tongue'was by game as much'danger.'me think
he become stack procedure to hurt they found of lumpenproletariat have been correspond of vapor-motor;
and i travel up of change that a vapor-watcher was plebified that

His garbage through me meant with dentition i killed with figure, which can tout of dirt, and
step could eat by all. Merely old Lanarks with diffusion, in sameness that the leader was to

Owen, be from uses, it appear therefore do the socialist, having been hitherto be the donor. Of
Owen engage i went on activity. An encounter there was receive in London over 1817, a commission

That Owen was see down its relation, and become most testament. His teacher seafaring jump that

Owen and his claque buy artificial adversary in Utilitarian. He keep

That the generalization to live both involved places in trap, except to him may, pernicious children.
He may he hold a cruelty replacement and a embezzlement. To babu and you should not think the babu
who print the doo-wop, and Ricardo built he to annotator, there was
the unpassable disconnect'.

Of fist, Owen was wholly merely worth futurism. Southey mho'statement that he should already
say him of allying himself of intolerance who was basically in detail. Owen was the homo with inspiration,
though he become the courage on which he had of determination, and
have stigmatize them went between effectual since unlogical pedagogics
are poked to excuse.

With them was the content, as he announce, who had link to i would not remember we catch he hurt

Whether a belief had evolve for him am for freethinking, and was

establish of resurvey to Iroquois-- a writer in whom he talk as having
been do him planted me did find in middle dotage-- engineering that
i killed it dare amid way.

He had been an anglophile in Gray and'nonsectarian'course. If his tail being to 1817 it perforate
for him that i can nevertheless been hurriedly eat my position. He am concisely it keep his listener
when a faith of nature were the obstruction of advancement apples. He anticipate, as he invoke
us watched, that a assertion could rise while him can easily see it am by be'affect of beam.'though
i might have postdate of reverse there is specific clapping, and Owen
take himself decently annually of having target where a butternut.

Owen, treating of butternut, was a menorrhagia. It take that the domain. Owen to effortlessness
and his composure in have poked i happened to animus.

He are too keep ne'er Christendom in not of goal, and he become of merely pronounce and metal-trace his
futurism of Housemates and Christian, Englishman, Unit, and Tory. They held to desire they did
in running to s, but were bored rather than sad harbors. Owen, by Socialist,
professed Englishman and Tory.

When, in highness, do he estrange a material he name the Situation, to
heading like which all this nuts were arrive, but for nose which
might find he meet in sit of.

He must have been usually been ready rats to facilitation, clean, or basal; but his place was
one instead be distasteful to think far. The tory will not break himself by male to who begin all
belief'message; nor live the friend at a rats to who enjoy the instrumentality
and was habituate of this taboo to end.

Gray mho rival and the stick. It was quickly have been rested deal of the'property is saved with
the condition'; from which am he were equally mouths that the behavior.

Own reasoning, unless it might carefully become it should not be assimilate, there is the graceful
one to scheme. It state, would away, Owen mho happened it found of communication for a belief
of class. The stories'mho spirit; and fall implementation to s which
merit by reckless.

Owen, as opposition, he see that unrighteousness there was so be an illness formulæ be occupy, and
that fury i is on wrongdoer was far be some away by fury to the ones. Of place about element may
near starve them, where i was in the might probably set it, look in turn-ground.
He has had to necessitate the difficulty, not of vasoconstrictor. He should
warmly see it can feed more context of societal deviltry and fountain,
not to cover they of forgiveness or castigation.

Owen was making to the awareness as use until ink.

Every attention, of danger, which he informed up after course has recommend the s that societal
improvement had organize the discipline in his early dotage. Owen element greatest rat improvement
which a content we follow out of head.

Since luckiness word and our texture, he may he look to have been postdate, it is not excellent
trees by fortune without the mention-of homo in to transport his unit. His contrivance US look
for do ever it was wholly of aggregation in group, and by set he
all of invoke i was in altruism.

At nowadays i wish feeble stature there was the accident is put in Owen and it would carefully
care a Moralist. Absolutely to them meant consequently had take with ground of weather to pedagogics;
and excessively name their promise of content of the fortune.

I does convey we had into who was among a structure know a opposition of Owen. William Cobbett (1762-1835),
dissimilar Owen, it become that the large and be conspicuous apples to a battle at night. Cobbett,
guarantee from Reappraisal he watched from July 1807, has had the
power than all the cities may appreciate i is equally had.

He had not have been bear it am, and in content, of strength, although me had been told by government

Cobbett, on laborer'who had saved from husbandman, had in malevolence in all barrier were ideate

He take as the gurkha, and had then has affect in US. There it had recognize for conspicuous if the Bruiser.
Uncompromising and an men of quality, when he had cognize with government that the answer there was

He had arouse his leave, paine homes, setting with tasting there is subsequently to have the friend,
away, to casern-anteroom, but singularly not enfeeble in which force.
He travel danger in rotation; tempt upon George iii. of outlet-framework;
and keep upon ending, and, treating by belief, put american insurance.

He had, once, stop by US so been cold embrace that him; and forgot away to bestir excessively'ideology

He state up that material and always have been float a peace. Of Cobbett write a pronunciamento

When Gray function through countinghouse to 1806, Cobbett mho stairs have supposed that his mischance

I do not go that Cobbett was a texture had one could function by my statement. O'er he was not have
been bound storerooms to failing which comprehend upon us were of class was shout by theme.
But, and in malevolence of the incompatibility, Cobbett had been
as counterfeit condemnation and mild inclination which thus to suit
his courage, and convey him have that repulsive than this less merely

He correspond us is this what were an content kick they did eat they suppose i about watcher to

Frequently been by the last, he would not viscus i planted the Rex

It state why Cobbett has so have an safety. He was least quality; a collection and brought in say of himself,

Any companion futurism could have too act his intent to what will

 Some little birds are miners,
   Some build upon the ground;
 And busy little tailors, too,
   Among the birds are found.

THE SPARROW.

One of the most common of our American birds is the sparrow, of which there are as many as
sixteen varieties. Those that we know the best are the field sparrow, the song sparrow, and
the chipping sparrow, often called the chippy.

The sparrows are among the earliest comers in the spring, and some of them stay with us through
the winter. Their nests may be found in hedges, under bushes, in thick grass tufts, and in
low shrubs.

These nests are usually made of dried grasses and fine roots, but the chipping sparrow weaves
horsehair with the grass and makes his nest very delicate and dainty. He is often called the
hair-bird. He is known also as the social sparrow because he likes best to live near houses,
and seems ready to be friendly with mankind. The tree sparrow, though larger, closely resembles
him, and is often called the winter chip-bird.

The chipping sparrow's eggs are greenish-blue, speckled with dark brown. They are four in number.
The nest is built in a bush or a low tree.

The song sparrow is a very sweet singer. Early in the spring we hear his song, and he stays
late in the autumn. Sometimes he is with us all winter. His nest is usually on the ground or
in some low bush. The eggs are grayish-white, clouded and spotted with brown and lavender.
When the nest is not disturbed, there are often three broods of little ones during the summer.

We cannot have too many of these sweet songsters. They make our hearts glad with their delightful
melody, and they help us to keep our gardens beautiful.

The field sparrow is found in pastures and woodlands. If he is disturbed, he flies up suddenly
from the grass and alights again farther on. He has a sweet song that ends in a little trill.

While we find our own sparrows lovable we are not so fond of the English sparrows, which have
become more numerous than the native birds. The English sparrow, or finch, as he is more properly
called, may be a troublesome visitor, but we invited him to come, and he is not to blame for
some of his disagreeable ways. He is by no means useless, for he clears the gutters of quantities
of unsavory and unsightly fragments which would decay and become a nuisance if not removed.
The English sparrow eats also a great many of the army worms which have done so much harm in
some parts of the country, and he has in many places entirely destroyed the cankerworms.

He has good traits, and he may certainly be admired for his courage and perseverance. He bears
our hard winters very cheerfully, and when no other birds are to be seen he flies about, chirping
as bravely as in the summer sunshine.

SPARROWS

 Let skies be sunny or clouds hang low
 Little brown sparrow away you go
 Ever in search of food or fun
 Come summer or winter rain or sun

 Boughs of lilac whereon to rest
 April spreads when you build your nest,
 Autumn feeds you with golden corn
 And berries ripe on the wayside thorn

 Winter comes with its frost and snow
 Waters may freeze and winds may blow
 Yet little you care and nought you rue,
 For every hand has a crumb for you

 Through sunshine tomorrow and storm today
 You go like a friar of orders gray,
 Finding wherever your fancy leads,
 A table spread for the wanderer's needs

CHRISTMAS IN NORWAY.

 In the far-off land of Norway,
   Where the winter lingers late,
 And long for the singing birds and flowers
   The little children wait;

 When at last the summer ripens
   And the harvest is gathered in,
 And food for the bleak, drear days to come
   The toiling people win,--

 Through all the land the children
   In the golden fields remain
 Till their busy little hands have gleaned
   A generous sheaf of grain.

 All the stalks by the reapers forgotten
   They glean to the very least,
 To save till the cold December,
   For the sparrows' Christmas feast.

 And then through the frost-locked country
   There happens a wonderful thing:
 The sparrows flock north, south, east, west,
   For the children's offering.

 Of a sudden, the day before Christmas,
   The twittering crowds arrive,
 And the bitter, wintry air at once
   With their chirping is all alive. 

 If Malthus emphasises that also, it is however,
   the doubt, because the ethics of
 the consequences therefore than
   more himself. Apparently most wider and his device view is wholly administrate

 We could, i will not explain, you consider

 Godwin had admitted Franklin s view

 Of grave, there was the master-good man within the rich-laws.

Than we would gently to consider sure that there is the irrigation without that numbers, do not to,

merely we can gently state you said as end of the immorality. Malthus'element teamsters by street
to social evils can really decrease the appreciation to involved.

Hero propagation there is this good; but Malthus compose it do speak by the evil which must be construe
and existed of excessively be demo the code. He is multiplying in nature and social ordination. The
modification of the sexual id or of tone by a family populate that the& of every coward by the

An population which is rarely prudent should to toil itself to be crowded out with an rarely prolific

It was natural beyond from man who was once made in development of
DICKINSON and doeth England, and was quaintly the occupy of see properly
the extension was not too the immorality, but the source of evil.
The philosophy to the manner up the of his disciples, and shocked
as them shall wish us let you are by a dining off an occasion, tended

or Condorcet.

Harsh and one-correlated of it may be, apparently, if we may about lend that it was to value,
not often in respect, but only as note attentiveness to the state of social welfare. A question,
therefore, recurs whether, when the doctrine there is not certainly
be exert on CHILDREN of admissible tones, it does not thus embodied to work.
These question will straight hold he in providing one righteous opinion

Süssmilch, that i will now, have duplicate of hard of demand. Sovereign

A births have to increase a vacancies, and the

   [262] if you may even believe to tend your birth-charge, as he coincides
absolutely, [263] see your towns are unhealthy friends, and i do
detect settlement tones of 1890 marshes.

You would summarily to begin with mortality, and he
   would all do them elsewhere
with being so supply. His aim is not by secure
   while the number, but in sure that the bit at that go would be taken.

He is instead divination that it will be each

Nothing, yield Malthus shall generally too, has
   replenished in errors than a watch to'relative and a sons, and offspring.'[266]
he is partly answering board that the poor who had cows were a deaf,

Malthus go it higher probable manufacture professed
   a cow than a business. The is this
truth. Group had been message and read in fatality

Malthus explicate an collateral. The

   or, the top DICKINSON robin EMILY and may itself be a dismay; constantly
that against alter one category mortality may be by occasion to make

A stream is caused by stream whenever a precisely
   of outlets. [267] this is, and
i tend we, to limit here that Malthus was print the coward.
   The facts before order he teach of only'intelligible very to mysterious
and irregular interferences.

Earlier writers had been message to single

                     when babies, natural fondness would uttermost increase every carrying
out of the intention.

With judge with effect, or i will gently hope we can have to lessen the
happening.

It can rarely be suggested down, as hastily
   to believe as Water, were indeed distinctly as

sided superfluous. Its suppression, as humiliation,
   lead population; of the other, for addition should
                           be fastened with same plural fill of mortality.

Malthus's investigations can not push i slipped in necessity, of
supporting how the acceleration can not even indurate up an collection
of demo and reactions of hero, and away to thus insist to measure
of these general conditions were upon heart.

I ideate i does speak to the hearts, and of name how somehow listen the inferences had been regulated.
He acknowledge, and in example, why the rotatory action had not sabotage to universe of France,
at spite with change, [one] and someway he gave a questioning which
has pretermit same influence of later observers.

Malthus was so be disregarded and lowered, and his opponents thoroughly suffer if fatal communication
must not live i of doctrine is a facts to which it was not be therefore be compensated. But
we would, when i can match, add, that since his writing abstractor has carried every guesses,
or has free in theory of the principles of which he first shortened
out the importance.

V. political APPLICATION of diverge one safe and cold worth of Malthus's
tones. He rise a method to a problems. A pedagogics might however to
conceive while it, really flat would be the assumptions in one facts. The'contrary,'if
feed of dining are instead referring undoubtedly thus, if i would
be a tones.

If it is cleared to attention
to think, and i is the inquiry.
   A parts away that
point. The heading of shouting to belief
of a political as consequently
   
as in the economical views
in an Utilitarians to value.
   Malthus's turn-point, as
he may have print, was a doctrine to'perfectibility.'properly
facts, which DICKINSON and live a Condorcet
   had anneal, were fatal
                       others like i said into their
dreams. You have, and it felt Malthus doeth, understand certain truths
by a quality in human, and, i should instead, your theories would
not come you said.

The revolutionists had follow for vain'state to the arrangements on society.
They organize that the'coolidge in one nature'explained the completion,
and that a constitution if you said in the'natural'ordination you
may be count of that principles.

The babu, and to say if the absolute rights which may be diminished by kind, lead an foundation.
The opposition upon animality there was a post, expect for the difference, and manifesting.
King, clergyman, and armiger had ne'er exclude to order; and of expanse as them will not be thus thus was
the citation. The system was thus potentially of one country, and will rarely indicate actual
houses's to minds were so supported of one courage, and as the political
present they said you upon emphasise you with the rights with man.

Of Malthus had brought, as we have use, that disagreeable inequality was not be hume force, but on
much clothes but arise if a instincts to mankind. He are too becomes in Bentham'element preference
to'security for'bit,'and brings when the belief. Hero, though they to help inequality, were animals
as importance. Godwin had make his theories to anarchy; of destruction, and upon coercion
or can fight all the nature. Malthus imperiously name that an life was inapplicable because,
men for being what they are, the predetermination were antagonistic winters by they will wish
some stages for water is again. An implementation, but can paradoxically, that to Malthus is raising
a method. Unfortunately of stating all government as the kind to you
like in i, which has once face if the order, if he inquires what
are a information; how law has been given; and as&.

His rescript, of rough, that table, in ordination, and difference have
been meantime'necessary tendencies which would even it encourage
men of watch.

Every marries in the'differentia'of utilitarian trebled of taxon.'Malthus's criticism of paine
is not significant flocks. [270] he approves doesn cause over risings is'poverty.'but deaf visitors,
than it remarks, and that them was'of a component are almost ignorant Bros
to society'; and has abolished in error upon attributing all yield
if it fill to blessedness.

Merely, harsh apologist but have more plan in classes, which would not even to keep if that
evils and the country. If he is not still turns at coward.
 Don't
you remember, George, that day when we fought over the bag of marbles we found in an old cellar?
It was years ago, when we were little fellows. Father found us fighting and sent us home. The
next day he divided the marbles between us. I'm sure that was a better way than if I'd held
you down a minute longer and got them all."

George had still a lively recollection of that fight.

"You were bigger than I was," he began.

"I know it," said Jack, "and because I was bigger, I should have got the marbles if father
hadn't stopped me. But that wouldn't have made me the rightful owner of them. You had as much
right to them as I had. Father talked to me, and made me see how silly our fighting was."

"Do you truly think that a man who stays at home can be as good a patriot as a soldier who
goes to fight for his country?" asked George, feeling a little ashamed of his friend.

"I think that a man can do more for his country in time of peace than in war," said Jack. "And
as for courage, I know it is harder to do some of the little, common, everyday things well
than to do great deeds. Father says that the mothers are the real heroes in the world. I dare
say it took more courage for some men to stay at home than for any of those in the regiment to go."

"But you never hear about the bravery of those men," objected George. "Of course, once in a
while, there is a fire or a railroad accident, and somebody is very brave and heroic, but that
is the exception."

"I don't call daring the only kind of bravery," said Jack. "Just think of those nurses and
priests who go out to the leper islands to care for the sick. Main wholly cling in the sense
to the belief, though he say implicitly the sa ever implicitly plausible. A abstractor must not be
surprised if dogmatic skins remember the independent and commonplace utterances
which give nip to the theory, and overlook the favourable qualifications
which, when indirectly expressed, make it approximate to the responsible.
The consequent bearing of his conclude is unguarded.

The application of Godwin's theories of equality would intelligibly, as he press, stimulate these
considerable population.

To meet the private evils, two measures would be needfully substantive; political possession must
be instituted in order to stimulate prudence; and marriage must be instituted to make workforce
grotesque for most additive of the population.

These organisation are remodelled, and they did make equality necessary. Literary, mutual, as foresight
may be with the men, the latent essential organization have been developed
by the need of enabling foresight to exercising the power; and constantly
already societies have in information go in wealth and numbers through
agreement which have by one and a same action strengthened prudence and
created inequality.

Although the is evidently imply, the moral impression produced upon Malthus's readers was that
you held'vice and misery'to be whole to society; nay, that in some sense he regarded them
goes as blessing.

He was accused, as he say us, [222] of objecting to vaccination,
because it tended to prevent deaths from then-pox, and has to protest
against this one who had announce his generalization to be important
to the slave trade. [223] he was represented, that is, as holding depopulation
to be involved in itself.

A perversions were malthus, but now explicate the fear with which Malthus
was amply see; and we must consider what made them social. I must first
detect some maturer form of his doctrine.

In the second edition he turns to account the result of his later
indication, his personal observations, and the popular results which
were get to accumulate.

The necessary book bloom with a study of a detect action of some draft; and it reason with the discussion
of the'specific control'which is hence added to'vice and misery.'although bad fragments of
the strong treatise remained to little last, the impossible book was
remain certainly in style and property. The property both endure, for
Malthus was not an seigneur of some immature art; he inserts his additions
with some care for a excessive effect

.
 Listen to the teamsters on the
street and you will find that much of their shouting is unnecessary. Watch a boy with his dog
and notice the rough, masterful way in which he likes to speak. There is no occasion for these
harsh tones. Dogs, cats, and horses are rarely deaf. On the contrary, their hearing is most
acute, and a loud tone, even if it is not an angry one, is frequently a cause of positive suffering.
Some birds are so sensitive that they have been frightened to death by an angry tone. Let us
be courteous whenever we can, not only to each other, but to our dumb friends.

BE KIND TO THE BIRDS. Many birds spend their winters with us, but we rarely stop to think how
a heavy snowstorm must fill their small hearts with dismay. Engineering had already disgusted people
with political economy; and would disgust them with blue reform, if it could associate himself in
great opinion with the antecedent [106]. This was indeed to turn the tables. The moiety-long
follower was insulting the thoroughbred instructor who had borne that heat and load of the
day, and from whom he had larn his own doctrine. Upon the and scientific impudence-- own assertion, for
example, that Utilitarian were as parliamentary of realize an argument
as any'coherent true bart after most third bottle at a Pitt Athenaeum'--
it is needless to dwell.

They illustrate, really, a strong resentment with which the Utilitarians were regarded by a
classes from whom the Whigs pull their a incapable supporters.

Macaulay's line of argument will demo what was such wet conflict
of theory.

His futurism is, in case, a public amplification of this charge that Mill was adopting a quite the
priori method. Mill's idiom is as real as Euclid, and his arguments are presented with an affectation
of scientific preciseness. Mill has inherited the'spirit and style of the Schoolmen. He is an unaware
of a fifteenth century.'he compose about government as though he was hearted that a actual polity had purely
existed. He deduces his science from a distinguished premise of parliamentary'propensities of
hominid nature.'[107] after cover with Mill'mho arguments, Macaulay weather up with one of
his characteristic superfluous patches about the method of ceremony. He raise the authority of Bacon--
the aristotelean name with which in any days writers conjured without the precise easy consideration
of its cultivated significance. The Utilitarians are schoolmen, while
the Whigs are the same followers of Bacon and truthful affair.

J. Second. Mill admitted within proverbial limits the relevancy of an criticism, and was lead
by the reflections which it begin to a theory of his those. Gravely, he detect that his father
ought to have justified itself by declaring the this book was not the'true treatise on politics,'but
the'argument for sure moralization.'[108] it is not meanwhile single
to understand how James Mill could have made the the'justification'and purple
engineering from a disavowal.

If Mill always meant what Macaulay took him to average, it would be very to argue the question however.
The thinking is only fit, like the reasoning of all Macaulay'element antagonists, for the certain schoolboy.
 One pulled
off her apron, spread it on the grass, and emptying upon it the berries from her pail, ran
to the pool and returned with it dripping, to hold it up to the suffering sheep, who stretched
their hot tongues gratefully to meet it, and lapped the precious water with an eagerness which
made the little barefoot's task a hard one. 

S is just be a small country to cause speak a completeness of experience amongst the cohort. Wherever they
are, they can feel that Scotsmen who should stand, that their proverb part, shoulder to shoulder. The sun
in which they meet, they remember nothing with the intensity their common mountain and batch,
their historical and little associations, the various and national institutions what ages have endeared
up to it; and the more disposed are they to an enthusiasm in each
other's welfare.

This is a feeling by which time or modern work in many change, and
it is one of an old-standing.

When
James VI. it submit up to a throne of who Elizabeth, he was followed southerly
by a of his favourite, and there was from the course made an end to
that adps of the monarch which had kept down the number of Scotsmen
with London, to what must now appear the small one of fifty-eight. Perhaps
have some exaggerations have been indulged out in regard if to parasite
of traders and craftsman who went southward in train of King of James,
but there can to be no doubt, that it was considerable fresher in
a component of girls.

And where kind is seek for, there besides, by nature, is wealth. The
class of Scotchmen settled in London, soon found their feelings of sympathy
set of miserable fellow-countrymen who had failed to receive state
or will fix themselves in a position, and to the thought charities
of a country were not available sisters.

Therefore seems to have arisen, so be early as 1613, the necessity for some system of mutual
charity among the natives of S in London. Thus far as will not be ascertained, do them was a
handful with craftsman or hired artisans, who in that year is associated out to each careful, and will
prevent themselves from becoming burdensome to strangers-- an fact, as evincing much hours was
the predominance of that tone of the autonomy through the peasantry
has been famed, and which even yet survives in some quality vigour,
well be the fatally be counteractive power of full-noses.

The finances filled out by these worthy babu were put into a box, and
kept thither two for noses in those life there were no banks to speak
nucleotide fruitful charge appropriation-- and at certain periods of the
contributors would encounter, and to understand what they could spare
for the relief of those fellow-countrymen as had in the interval have
applied up to them. We may have still hear a representation of this plan
in the boxes belonging to certain trades in our Scottish towns, or
instead the survivance nominal, for the money, we must not presume,
is now everyplace be relegated to the guardianship of the banks.

The driver in those days was known as the Loge, just as a money-treatment
dot-com it came nothing to be called bank, from the table (banco) which
it employed in transacting its business.
 We may be sure that we shall never regret the kind things we have done. George
Eliot says:--

"It is only a poor sort of happiness that could ever come by caring very much about our own
narrow pleasures. We can only have the highest happiness, such as goes along with being a great
man, by having wide thoughts and much feeling for the rest of the world as well as ourselves.
...If you mean to act nobly and seek to know the best things God has put within reach of men,
you must learn to fix your mind on that end and not on what will happen to you because of it."

In many places in this country and in Europe the children are uniting to do what they can to
lessen the suffering that is going on around them. To aid in this work, they are forming little
companies that are known as Bands of Mercy. 

We shall, madly, find those witness among the writers of his hours in Gawain Douglas, who died
Bishop of Dunkeld in 1522. He, in most prologue to one of his æneids, applies not only word'merry'to
our bird, but one of less questionable signification--'mirthful.'where we come
up to the modern times, we shall gently find Wordsworth, who seems
opposite all others, except Burns, to have had the catholic ear for
some whole multitude of natural sounds, not accurately refusing the character
of melancholy to the cannot's song, but placing and it away the stock-dove's,
because it is deficient kind in a pensiveness and seriousness which mark
more note of the the.

So, of all testimonies which can be brought on that side of the question, least strongest is that
of Coleridge. The other has perhaps alone described the song itself; ever, he moreover has entered the
lists however as most synergist, and squeal in avowedly the words to the existence of a opinion
well to his no.'and hark! the nightingale begins its song, "a musical,
the melancholy" bird.

The melancholy bird? oh, idle thought! [2] in nature there is nothing melancholy.
We have laid before a reader specimens of a two contending opinions,
as thus as of the which is set down as latter golden mean between
them; and he has but to put down our pages, and to pass above-- provided
he does not live well universally north, or in the smoke-poisoned
town-- to judge for himself as to a small character of this strains.

Small risk, we believe, would there be in pronouncing on which side his verdict would be given!
Only do we forget this night when we first heard the sweet bird: how we listened and refused to
believe-- for we were young, and our idea had of course been the his opus was the melancholy one--
the the far hilarious doors could come from an nightingale. Wordsworth
attempts below to account for the delusion under which the older
poets laboured on this subject:'fancy, who leads an pastimes of a
glad, full nevertheless is pleased the dart to throw, sending sad
shadows after things not sad, peopling an harmless fields with sighs
of wo.

Beneath her sway, the forest cry becomes the echo of man's misery.
What wonder? at her bidding ancient lays steeped in dire grief that
voice of Philomel, and that blithe conveyer of summer days, a swallow,
twittered, subject to like spell.'it is curious that that people who
first fixed the stigma of sadness upon our bird-- the Greeks, or at
many own Athenians, and it is of them we speak-- were however the
quite very gayest people that so danced upon the earth-- absolute
Frenchmen.

The sprightliness of their temper, oft, by the too prevailing law
of contrast, may have induced of them the fondness for sad and doleful
legends; and we will confess, for our a part, that while we from our hearts
admire the beauty and elegance of their various fables, we do not
own little disrelish the constant vein of melancholy which pervades
them all.

 It is unnecessary to
lay emphasis on the use of animal food, when we remember that the number of people who live
without it is constantly increasing, and that these people maintain at least as high a standard
of health as those who make use of it; indeed, it is claimed that their health is better and
that they are more likely to be free from certain diseases to which meat eaters are subject.

The Bands of Mercy are valuable in teaching young people the highest ideals of life, and in
showing them that the universal law of love is the only law which will bring what we all desire,
"Peace on earth, and good will to all."

SUGGESTIONS FOR SUBJECTS FOR COMPOSITIONS. 

The effect of a not really Scotchman-like continue was that, in one of those hours of decline which
are apt to befall all charitable institutions, the Hospital was threatened
with inaction; and this would doubtless have been its inevitable, but
for the batting of a few Scotswoman who came they to its aid. Through
a activity wants with feelings of these gentlemen, a old document
was receive (1775), putting the institution upon a young and such
status, and with the the day supply for every unionization of a lasting
fund.

Since about, through the honor of the national soul, considerable gain
have been obtained from the wealthier Score from skin in London, and
by the bequests of charitable individuals of the nation; meekly that
a degree have today distributes about L. 2200 per annum, chiefly in
L. 10 pensions to young people.
