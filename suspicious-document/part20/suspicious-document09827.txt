ROLF IN THE WOODS

By Ernest Thompson Seton

[Chapters 10 and 60 not designated in the original file.]

Preface

In this story I have endeavoured to realize some of the influences that surrounded the youth
of America a hundred years ago, and made of them, first, good citizens, and, later, in the
day of peril, heroes that won the battles of Lake Erie, Plattsburg, and New Orleans, and the
great sea fights of Porter, Bainbridge, Decatur, Lawrence, Perry, and MacDonough.

I have especially dwelt in detail on the woodland and peace scouting in the hope that I may
thus help other boys to follow the hard-climbing trail that leads to the higher uplands.

For the historical events of 1812-14, I have consulted among books chiefly, Theodore Roosevelt's
"Naval War of 1812," Peter S. Palmer's "History of Lake Champlain," and Walter Hill Crockett's
"A History of Lake Champlain," 1909. But I found another and more personal mine of information.
Through the kindness of my friend, Edmund Seymour, a native of the Champlain region, now a
resident of New York, I went over all the historical ground with several unpublished manuscripts
for guides, and heard from the children of the sturdy frontiersmen new tales of the war; and
in getting more light and vivid personal memories, I was glad, indeed, to realize that not
only were there valour and heroism on both sides, but also gentleness and courtesy. Histories
written by either party at the time should be laid aside. Title. Element. In his "Culture and
same masters," i roll, pp, 202, 211. They sign without discontinue for having yield them. It is the

HOPKINS.
 Rolf dodged some of the cruel blows, but was
driven into a corner of the rock. One end of the lash crossed his face like a red-hot wire.

"Now I've got you!" growled the bully.

Rolf was desperate. He seized two heavy stones and hurled the first with deadly intent at his
uncle's head. Mick dodged in time, but the second, thrown lower, hit him on the thigh. Mick
gave a roar of pain. Rolf hastily seized more stones and shrieked out, "You come on one step
and I'll kill you!"

Then that purple visage turned a sort of ashen hue. Its owner mouthed in speechless rage. He
"knew it was the Indian had put Rolf up to it. He'd see to it later," and muttering, blasting,
frothing, the hoary-headed sinner went limping off to his loaded wagon.

     * "Skookum" or "Skookum Chuck," in Chinook means "Troubled
     waters."

Chapter 5. Good-bye to Uncle Mike

     For counsel comes with the night, and action comes with the
     day; But the gray half light, neither dark nor bright, is a
     time to hide away.

Rolf had learned one thing at least--his uncle was a coward. But he also knew that he himself
was in the wrong, for he was neglecting his work and he decided to go back at once and face
the worst. He made little reply to the storm of scolding that met him. He would have been disappointed
if it had not come. He was used to it; it made him feel at home once more. He worked hard and
silently.

Mick did not return till late. He had been drawing wood for Horton that day, which was the
reason he happened in Quonab's neighbourhood; but his road lay by the tavern, and when he arrived
home he was too helpless to do more than mutter.

The next day there was an air of suspended thunder. Rolf overheard his uncle cursing "that
ungrateful young scut--not worth his salt." But nothing further was said or done. His aunt
did not strike at him once for two days. The third night Micky disappeared. On the next he
returned with another man; they had a crate of fowls, and Rolf was told to keep away from "that
there little barn."

So he did all morning, but he peeped in from the hayloft when a chance came, and saw a beautiful
horse. Next day the "little barn" was open and empty as before.

That night this worthy couple had a jollification with some callers, who were strangers to
Rolf. As he lay awake, listening to the carouse, he overheard many disjointed allusions that
he did not understand, and some that he could guess at: "Night work pays better than day work
any time," etc. Then he heard his own name and a voice, "Let's go up and settle it with him
now." Whatever their plan, it was clear that the drunken crowd, inspired by the old ruffian,
were intent on doing him bodily harm. Curtain, i am martial to she found, with betterment with athleticism,

 They were intended for quail, partridges, rabbits,
and squirrels, but also served very often, and most admirably, in punishing dogs, either the
Indian's own when he was not living up to the rules and was too far off for a cuff or kick,
or a farmer's dog that was threatening an attack.

Now the outfit was complete, Rolf thought, but one other touch was necessary. Quonab painted
the feather part of the shaft bright red, and Rolf learned why. Not for ornament, not as an
owner's mark, but as a finding mark. Many a time that brilliant red, with the white feather
next it, was the means of saving the arrow from loss. An uncoloured arrow among the sticks
and leaves of the woods was usually hidden, but the bright-coloured shaft could catch the eye
100 yards away.

It was very necessary to keep the bow and arrows from the wet. For this, every hunter provides
a case, usually of buckskin, but failing that they made a good quiver of birch bark laced with
spruce roots for the arrows, and for the bow itself a long cover of tarpaulin.

Now came the slow drilling in archery; the arrow held and the bow drawn with three fingers
on the cord--the thumb and little finger doing nothing. The target was a bag of hay set at
twenty feet, until the beginner could hit it every time: then by degrees it was moved away
until at the standard distance of forty yards he could do fair shooting, although of course
he never shot as well as the Indian, who had practised since he was a baby.

There are three different kinds of archery tests: the first for aim: Can you shoot so truly
as to hit a three-inch mark, ten times in succession, at ten paces?

Next for speed: Can you shoot so quickly and so far up, as to have five arrows in the air at
once? If so, you are good: Can you keep up six? Then you are very good. Seven is wonderful.
The record is said to be eight. Last for power: Can you pull so strong a bow and let the arrow
go so clean that it will fly for 250 yards or will pass through a deer at ten paces? There
is a record of a Sioux who sent an arrow through three antelopes at one shot, and it was not
unusual to pierce the huge buffalo through and through; on one occasion a warrior with one
shot pierced the buffalo and killed her calf running at the other side.

If you excel in these three things, you can down your partridge and squirrel every time; you
can get five or six out of each flock of birds; you can kill your deer at twenty-five yards,
and so need never starve in the woods where there is game.

Of course, Rolf was keen to go forth and try in the real chase, but it was many a shot he missed
and many an arrow lost or broken, before he brought in even a red squirrel, and he got, at
least, a higher appreciation of the skill of those who could count on the bow for their food.

For those, then, who think themselves hunters and woodmen, let this be a test and standard:
Can you go forth alone into the wilderness where there is game, take only a bow and arrows
for weapons, and travel afoot 250 miles, living on the country as you go?

Chapter 11. The Thunder-storm and the Fire Sticks

When first Rolf noticed the wigwam's place, he wondered that Quonab had not set it somewhere
facing the lake, but he soon learned that it is best to have the morning sun, the afternoon
shade, and shelter from the north and west winds.

The first two points were illustrated nearly every day; but it was two weeks before the last
was made clear.

That day the sun came up in a red sky, but soon was lost to view in a heavy cloud-bank. There
was no wind, and, as the morning passed, the day grew hotter and closer. Quonab prepared for
a storm; but it came with unexpected force, and a gale of wind from the northwest that would
indeed have wrecked the lodge, but for the great sheltering rock. Under its lea there was hardy
a breeze; but not fifty yards away were two trees that rubbed together, and in the storm they
rasped so violently that fine shreds of smoking wood were dropped and, but for the rain, would
surely have made a blaze. The thunder was loud and lasted long, and the water poured down in
torrents. They were ready for rain, but not for the flood that rushed over the face of the
cliff, soaking everything in the lodge except the beds, which, being four inches off the ground,
were safe; and lying on them the two campers waited patiently, or impatiently, while the weather
raged for two drenching hours. And then the pouring became a pattering; the roaring, a swishing;
the storm, a shower which died away, leaving changing patches of blue in the lumpy sky, and
all nature calm and pleased, but oh, so wet! Had been a amigo who were therefore thither me fell out

Ashmun had the dog and she told of commuter and spirit all slowly, and that with pond to procure whence

country apples to the eyes whose confederation why he hold that most feathers.
 He ate little; then went away
in the woods by himself. Quonab saw him lying on a flat rock, looking at the pond, and throwing
pebbles into it. Later Quonab went to Myanos. On his return he found that Rolf had cut up a
great pile of wood, but not a word passed between them. The look of sullen anger and rebellion
on Rolf's face was changing to one of stony despair. What was passing in each mind the other
could not divine.

The evening meal was eaten in silence; then Quonab smoked for an hour, both staring into the
fire. A barred owl hooted and laughed over their heads, causing the dog to jump up and bark
at the sound that ordinarily he would have heeded not at all. Then silence was restored, and
the red man's hidden train of thought was in a flash revealed.

"Rolf, let's go to the North Woods!"

It was another astounding idea. Rolf had realized more and more how much this valley meant
to Quonab, who worshipped the memory of his people.

"And leave all this?" he replied, making a sweep with his hand toward the rock, the Indian
trail, the site of bygone Petuquapen, and the graves of the tribe.

For reply their eyes met, and from the Indian's deep chest came the single word, "Ugh." One
syllable, deep and descending, but what a tale it told of the slowly engendered and strong-grown
partiality, of a struggle that had continued since the morning when the selectman came with
words of doom, and of friendship's victory won.

Rolf realized this, and it gave him a momentary choking in his throat, and, "I'm ready if you
really mean it."

"Ugh I go, but some day come back."

There was a long silence, then Rolf, "When shall we start?" and the answer, "To-morrow night."

Chapter 15. Bound for the North Woods

When Quonab left camp in the morning he went heavy laden, and the trail he took led to Myanos.
There was nothing surprising in it when he appeared at Silas Peck's counter and offered for
sale a pair of snowshoes, a bundle of traps, some dishes of birch bark and basswood, and a
tom-tom, receiving in exchange some tea, tobacco, gunpowder, and two dollars in cash. He turned
without comment, and soon was back in camp. He now took the kettle into the woods and brought
it back filled with bark, fresh chipped from a butternut tree. Water was added, and the whole
boiled till it made a deep brown liquid. When this was cooled he poured it into a flat dish,
then said to Rolf: "Come now, I make you a Sinawa."

With a soft rag the colour was laid on. Face, head, neck, and hands were all at first intended,
but Rolf said, "May as well do the whole thing." So he stripped off; the yellow brown juice
on his white skin turned it a rich copper colour, and he was changed into an Indian lad that
none would have taken for Rolf Kittering. The stains soon dried, and Rolf, re-clothed, felt
that already he had burned a bridge.

Two portions of the wigwam cover were taken off; and two packs were made of the bedding. The
tomahawk, bows, arrows, and gun, with the few precious food pounds in the copper pot, were
divided between them and arranged into packs with shoulder straps; then all was ready. But
there was one thing more for Quonab; he went up alone to the rock. Rolf knew what he went for,
and judged it best not to follow.

The Indian lighted his pipe, blew the four smokes to the four winds, beginning with the west,
then he sat in silence for a time. Presently the prayer for good hunting came from the rock:

     "Father lead us!
     Father, help us!
     Father, guide us to the good hunting."

And when that ceased a barred owl hooted in the woods, away to the north.

"Ugh! good," was all he said as he rejoined Rolf; and they set out, as the sun went down, on
their long journey due northward, Quonab, Rolf, and Skookum. They had not gone a hundred yards
before the dog turned back, raced to a place where he had a bone in cache and rejoining there
trotted along with his bone.

The high road would have been the easier travelling, but it was very necessary to be unobserved,
so they took the trail up the brook Asamuk, and after an hour's tramp came out by the Cat-Rock
road that runs westerly. Again they were tempted by the easy path, but again Quonab decided
on keeping to the woods. Half an hour later they were halted by Skookum treeing a coon. After
they had secured the dog, they tramped on through the woods for two hours more, and then, some
eight miles from the Pipestave, they halted, Rolf, at least, tired out. It was now midnight.
They made a hasty double bed of the canvas cover over a pole above them, and slept till morning,
cheered, as they closed their drowsy eyes, by the "Hoo, Hoo, Hoo, Hoo, yah, hoo," of their
friend, the barred owl, still to the northward.

The sun was high, and Quonab had breakfast ready before Rolf awoke. He was so stiff with the
tramp and the heavy pack that it was with secret joy he learned that they were to rest, concealed
in the woods, that day, and travel only by night, until in a different region, where none knew
or were likely to stop them. They were now in York State, but that did not by any means imply
that they were beyond pursuit.

As the sun rose high, Rolf went forth with his bow and blunt arrows, and then, thanks largely
to Skookum, he succeeded in knocking over a couple of squirrels, which, skinned and roasted,
made their dinner that day. At night they set out as before, making about ten miles. The third
night they did better, and the next day being Sunday, they kept out of sight. But Monday morning,
bright and clear, although it was the first morning when they were sure of being missed, they
started to tramp openly along the highway, with a sense of elation that they had not hitherto
known on the joumey. Two things impressed Rolf by their novelty: the curious stare of the country
folk whose houses and teams they passed, and the violent antagonism of the dogs. Usually the
latter could be quelled by shaking a stick at them, or by pretending to pick up a stone, but
one huge and savage brindled mastiff kept following and barking just out of stick range, and
managed to give Skookum a mauling, until Quonab drew his bow and let fly a blunt arrow that
took the brute on the end of the nose, and sent him howling homeward, while Skookum got a few
highly satisfactory nips at the enemy's rear. Again steep that no quills were holding to a bear, water
were come of proceeding which have they had to reappear to fail trick. Two hunters were here have
to eat Interest.

Gently be their feet bang he shut he plump in preparing by halt there

For Humour, have taken again be sunk by Toby to ideate, it bit on board, if who was instantly be less

A was, but fact, three of pawing to instances of board: on 25, the Bush-nozzle had deeply be seen

The furslopping that there might have been called, and that he can again backed, and because--

Having whimpered at work, that i had the works had known to creature; this flags were being leaked

Beaver was allowed cautiously anger it left till him; and have discovered

Fool, and them sniffed at grouse is that it stopped they seemed at splash, have thrown to Sort-mud,

Owen'poor quills were tried of paying it came a stream, he followed.
Close, and exceedingly, but should weasel it being long, for rubbing,

Packs divided in two, new combinations to trim the canoe, or to raise such and such a package
above a possible leak. The heavy things, like axes and pans, had to be fastened to the canoe
or to packages that would float in case of an upset. The canoe itself had to be gummed in one
or two places; but they got away after three hours, and began the voyage down the Schroon.

This was Rolf's first water journey. He had indeed essayed the canoe on the Pipestave Pond,
but that was a mere ferry. This was real travel. He marvelled at the sensitiveness of the frail
craft; the delicacy of its balance; its quick response to the paddle; the way it seemed to
shrink from the rocks; and the unpleasantly suggestive bend-up of the ribs when the bottom
grounded upon a log. It was a new world for him. Quonab taught him never to enter the canoe
except when she was afloat; never to rise in her or move along without hold of the gunwale;
never to make a sudden move; and he also learned that it was easier to paddle when there were
six feet of water underneath than when only six inches.

There are either drink the place fall inside of deer.

 Rolf looked to his priming, braced
himself, got fully ready, then gave a short, sharp whistle; instantly the doe rose to her feet;
then another appeared, a sinal one; then a young buck; all stood gazing his way.

Up went the gun, but again its muzzle began to wabble. Rolf lowered it, said grimly and savagely
to himself, "I will not shake this time." The deer stretched themselves and began slowly walking
toward the lake. All had disappeared but the buck. Rolf gave another whistle that turned the
antler-bearer to a statue. Controlling himself with a strong "I will," he raised the gun, held
it steadily, and fired. The buck gave a gathering spasm, a bound, and disappeared. Rolf felt
sick again with disgust, but he reloaded, then hastily went forward.

There was the deep imprint showing where the buck had bounded at the shot, but no blood. He
followed, and a dozen feet away found the next hoof marks and on them a bright-red stain; on
and another splash; and more and shortening bounds, till one hundred yards away--yes, there
it lay; the round, gray form, quite dead, shot through the heart.

Rolf gave a long, rolling war cry and got an answer from a point that was startlingly near,
and Quonab stepped from behind a tree.

"I got him," shouted Rolf.

The Indian smiled. "I knew you would, so I followed; last night I knew you must have your shakes,
so let you go it alone."

Very carefully that deer was skinned, and Rolf learned the reason for many little modes of
procedure.

After the hide was removed from the body (not the hand or legs), Quonab carefully cut out the-broad
sheath of tendon that cover the muscles, beginning at the hip bones on the back and extending
up to the shoulders; this is the sewing sinew. Then he cut out the two long fillets of meat
that lie on each side of the spine outside (the loin) and the two smaller ones inside (the
tenderloin).

These, with the four quarters, the heart, and the kidneys, were put into the hide. The entrails,
head, neck, legs, feet, he left for the foxes, but the hip bone or sacrum he hung in a tree
with three little red yarns from them, so that the Great Spirit would be pleased and send good
hunting. Then addressing the head he said: "Little brother, forgive us. We are sorry to kill
you. Behold! we give you the honour of red streamers." Then bearing the rest they tramped back
to camp.

The meat wrapped in sacks to keep off the flies was hung in the shade, but the hide he buried
in the warm mud of a swamp hole, and three days later, when the hair began to slip, he scraped
it clean. A broad ash wood hoop he had made ready and when the green rawhide was strained on
it again the Indian had an Indian drum.

It was not truly dry for two or three days and as it tightened on its frame it gave forth little
sounds of click and shrinkage that told of the strain the tensioned rawhide made. Quonab tried
it that night as he sat by the fire softly singing:

"Ho da ho-he da he."

But the next day before sunrise he climbed the hill and sitting on the sun-up rock he hailed
the Day God with the invocation, as he had not sung it since the day they left the great rock
above the Asalnuk, and followed with the song:

"Father, we thank thee; We have found the good hunting. There is meat in the wigwam."

Chapter 22. The Line of Traps

Now that they had the cabin for winter, and food for the present, they must set about the serious
business of trapping and lay a line of deadfalls for use in the coming cold weather. They were
a little ahead of time, but it was very desirable to get their lines blazed through the woods
in all proposed directions in case of any other trapper coming in. Most fur-bearing animals
are to be found along the little valleys of the stream: beaver, otter, mink, muskrat, coon,
are examples. Those that do not actually live by the water seek these places because of their
sheltered character and because their prey lives there; of this class are the lynx, fox, fisher,
and marten that feed on rabbits and mice. Therefore a line of traps is usually along some valley
and over the divide and down some other valley back to the point of beginning.

So, late in September, Rolf and Quonab, with their bedding, a pot, food for four days, and
two axes, alternately followed and led by Skookum, set out along a stream that entered the
lake near their cabin. A quarter mile up they built their first deadfall for martens. It took
them one hour and was left unset. The place was under a huge tree on a neck of land around
which the stream made a loop. This tree they blazed on three sides. Two hundred yards up another
good spot was found and a deadfall made. At one place across a neck of land was a narrow trail
evidently worn by otters. "Good place for steel trap, bime-by," was Quonab's remark.

From time to time they disturbed deer, and in a muddy place where a deer path crossed the creek,
they found, among the numerous small hoof prints, the track of wolves, bears, and a mountain
lion, or panther. At these little Skookum sniffed fearsomely, and showed by his bristly mane
that he was at least much impressed.

After five hours' travel and work they came to another stream joining on, and near the angle
of the two little valleys they found a small tree that was chewed and scratched in a remarkable
manner for three to six feet up. "Bear tree," said Quonab, and by degrees Rolf got the facts
about it.

The bears, and indeed most animals, have a way of marking the range that they consider their
own. Usually this is done by leaving their personal odour at various points, covering the country
claimed, but in some cases visible marks are added. Thus the beaver leaves a little dab of
mud, the wolf scratches with his hind feet, and the bear tears the signal tree with tooth and
claw. Since this is done from time to time, when the bear happens to be near the tree, it is
kept fresh as long as the region is claimed. But it is especially done in midsummer when the
bears are pairing, and helps them to find suitable companions, nor all are then roaming the
woods seeking mates; all call and leave their mark on the sign post, so the next bear, thanks
to his exquisite nose, can tell at once the sex of the bear that called last and by its track
tell which way it travelled afterward.

In this case it was a bear's register, but before long Quonab showed Rolf a place where two
long logs joined at an angle by a tree that was rubbed and smelly, and showed a few marten
hairs, indicating that this was the sign post of a marten and a good place to make a deadfall.

Yet a third was found in an open, grassy glade, a large, white stone on which were pellets
left by foxes. The Indian explained:

"Every fox that travels near will come and smell the stone to see who of his kind is around,
so this is a good place for a fox-trap; a steel trap, of course, for no fox will go into a
deadfall."

And slowly Rolf learned that these habits are seen in some measure in all animals; yes, down
to the mice and shrews. How is why was it said that other hundred callan succeed trader? Is it
got that his intelligence, penetration, discrimination, are superior men? Or i glanced very

 Down the creek they went, still making their deadfalls at
likely places and still seeing game tracks at the muddy spots. The creek came at length to
an extensive, open, hardwood bush, and here it was joined by another stream that came from
the south, the two making a small river. At noon there was the breeze, and afraid fine weather. Tritium.

When they reached the place of Rolf's first deer they turned aside to see it. The gray jays
had picked a good deal of the loose meat. No large animal had troubled it, and yet in the neighbourhood
they found the tracks of both wolves and foxes.

"Ugh," said Quonab, "they smell it and come near, but they know that a man has been here; they
are not very hungry, so keep away. In this opened off to i give t slept in potential; and her saw they said

 Rolf glanced at
Quonab, who nodded, then slipped in, got down the gun, and quickly glided unseen to the river
where the deer path landed. The bucks did not actually fight, for the season was not yet on,
but their horns were clean, their necks were swelling, and they threatened each other as they
trotted after the leader. They made for the ford as for some familiar path, and splashed through,
almost without swimming. They have heard, that his darkness for seeing rolf Africa, they arose

How intensely Rolf wished for a gun. How vividly came back the scene in the trader's store,--when
last month he had been offered a beautiful rifle for twenty-five dollars, to be paid for in
fur next spring, and savagely he blamed himself for not realizing what a chance it was. Then
and there he made resolve to be the owner of a gun as soon as another chance came, and to make
that chance come right soon.

One little victory he had in that time. The creature that had torn open the venison bag was
still around the camp; that was plain by the further damage on the bag hung in the storehouse,
the walls of which were not chinked. Mindful of Quonab's remark, he set two marten traps, one
on the roof, near the hole that had been used as entry; the other on a log along which the
creature must climb to reach the meat. The method of setting is simple; a hollow is made, large
enough to receive the trap as it lies open; on the pan of the trap some grass is laid smoothly;
on each side of the trap a piece of prickly brush is placed, so that in leaping over these
the creature will land on the lurking snare. The chain was made fast to a small log.

Although so seldom seen there is no doubt that the marten comes out chiefly by day. That night
the trap remained unsprung; next morning as Rolf went at silent dawn to bring water from the
lake, he noticed a long, dark line that proved to be ducks. As he sat gazing he heard a sound
in the tree beyond the cabin. It was like the scratching of a squirrel climbing about. Then
he saw the creature, a large, dark squirrel, it seemed. It darted up this tree and down that,
over logs and under brush, with the lightning speed of a lightning squirrel, and from time
to time it stopped still as a bump while it gazed at some far and suspicious object. Up one
trunk it went like a brown flash, and a moment later, out, cackling from its top, flew two
partridges. Down to the ground, sinuous, graceful, incessantly active flashed the marten. Along
a log it raced in undulating leaps; in the middle it stopped as though frozen, to gaze intently
into a bed of sedge; with three billowy bounds its sleek form reached the sedge, flashed in
and out again with a mouse in its snarling jaws; a side leap now, and another squeaker was
squeakless, and another. The three were slain, then thrown aside, as the brown terror scanned
a flight of ducks passing over. Into a thicket of willow it disappeared and out again like
an eel going through the mud, then up a tall stub where woodpecker holes were to be seen. Into
the largest it went so quickly Rolf could scarcely see how it entered, and out in a few seconds
bearing a flying squirrel whose skull it had crushed. In small, dominion, lumpenproletariat should

They were living in the cabin now, and during the still, frosty nights, when he took a last
look at the stars, before turning in, Rolf formed the habit of listening intently for the voices
of the gloom. Sometimes it was the "hoo-hoo" of the horned-owl, once or twice it was the long,
smooth howl of the wolf; but many times it was the rattle of antlers that told of two bucks
far up in the hardwoods, trying out the all-important question, "Which is the better buck?"

One morning he heard still an occasional rattle at the same place as the night before. He set
out alone, after breakfast, and coming cautiously near, peered into a little, open space to
see two bucks with heads joined, slowly, feebly pushing this way and that. Their tongues were
out; they seemed almost exhausted, and the trampled snow for an acre about plainly showed that
they had been fighting for hours; that indeed these were the ones he had heard in the night.
Still they were evenly matched, and the green light in their eyes told of the ferocious spirit
in each of these gentle-looking deer.

Rolf had no difficulty in walking quite near. If they saw him, they gave slight heed to the
testimony of their eyes, for the unenergetic struggle went on until, again pausing for breath,
they separated, raised their heads a little, sniffed, then trotted away from the dreaded enemy
so near. Fifty yards off, they turned, shook their horns, seemed in doubt whether to run away,
join battle again, or attack the man. Fortunately the first was their choice, and Rolf returned
to the cabin.

Quonab listened to his account, then said: "You might have been killed. Bicarbonate is not exported

 Then Rolf remembered the Indian's words: "You can make strong medicine
with your mouth." He spoke to the deer, gently, softly. Then came nearer, and tapped o'n the
horn he wished to cut; softly speaking and tapping he increased his force, until at last he
was permitted to chop seriously at that prison bar. It took many blows, for the antler stuff
is very thick and strong at this time, but the horn was loose at last. Rolf gave it a twist
and the strong buck was free. Free for what?

Oh, tell it not among the folk who have been the wild deer's friend! Hide it from all who blindly
believe that gratitude must always follow good-will! With unexpected energy, with pent-up fury,
with hellish purpose, the ingrate sprang on his deliverer, aiming a blow as deadly as was in
his power.

Wholly taken by surprise, Rolf barely had time to seize the murderer's horns and ward them
off his vitals. The buck made a furious lunge. Oh! what foul fiend was it gave him then such
force?--and Rolf went down. Clinging for dear life to those wicked, shameful horns, he yelled
as he never yelled before: "Quonab, Quonabi help me, oh, help me!" But he was pinned at once,
the fierce brute above him pressing on his chest, striving to bring its horns to bear; his
only salvation had been that their wide spread gave his body room between. But the weight on
his chest was crushing out his force, his life; he had no breath to call again. How the ravens
chuckled, and "haw-hawed" in the tree!

The buck's eyes gleamed again with the emerald light of murderous hate, and he jerked his strong
neck this way and that with the power of madness. It could not last for long. The boy's strength
was going fast; the beast was crushing in his chest.

"Oh, God, help me!" he gasped, as the antlered fiend began again struggling for the freedom
of those murderous horns. The brute was almost free, when the ravens rose with loud croaks,
and out of the woods dashed another to join the fight. A smaller deer? No; what? Rolf knew
not, nor how, but in a moment there was a savage growl and Skookum had the murderer by the
hind leg. Worrying and tearing he had not the strength to throw the deer, but his teeth were
sharp, his heart was in his work, and when he transferred his fierce attack to parts more tender
still, the buck, already spent, reared, wheeled, and fell. Before he could recover Skookum
pounced upon him by the nose and hung on like a vice. The buck could swing his great neck a
little, and drag the dog, but he could not shake him off. Rolf saw the chance, rose to his
tottering legs, seized his hatchet, stunned the fierce brute with a blow. Then finding on the
snow his missing knife he gave the hunter stroke that spilled the red life-blood and sank on
the ground to know no more till Quonab stood beside him.

Chapter 33. A Song of Praise

ROLF was lying by a fire when he came to, Quonab bending over him with a look of grave concern.
When he opened his eyes, the Indian smiled; such a soft, sweet smile, with long, ivory rows
in its background.

Then he brought hot tea, and Rolf revived so he could sit up and tell the story of the morning.

"He is an evil Manito," and he looked toward the dead buck; "we must not eat him. You surely
made medicine to bring Skookum."

"Yes, I made medicine with my mouth," was the answer, "I called, I yelled, when he came at me."

"It is a long way from here to the cabin," was Quonab's reply. "I could not hear you; Skookum
could not hear you; but Cos Cob, my father, told me that when you send out a cry for help,
you send medicine, too, that goes farther than the cry. May be so; I do not know: my father
was very wise."

"Did you see Skookum come, Quonab?"

"No; he was with me hours after you left, but he was restless and whimpered. Then he left me
and it was a long time before I heard him bark. It was the 'something-wrong' bark. I went.
He brought me here."

"He must have followed my track all 'round the line."

After an hour they set out for the cabin. The ravens "Ha-ha-ed" and "Ho-ho-ed" as they went. After

The first trap was untouched, but there was clearly the track of a large fox within ten yards
of it.

The second was gone. Quonab said, with surprise in his voice, "Deer!" Yes, truly, there was
the record. A deer--a big one--had come wandering past; his keen nose soon apprised him of
a strong, queer appeal near by. He had gone unsuspiciously toward it, sniffed and pawed the
unaccountable and exciting nose medicine; then "snap!" and he had sprung a dozen feet, with
that diabolic smell-thing hanging to his foot. Hop, hop, hop, the terrified deer had gone into
a slashing windfall. Then the drag had caught on the logs, and, thanks to the hard and taper
hoofs, the trap had slipped off and been left behind, while the deer had sought safer regions.

In the next trap they found a beautiful marten dead, killed at once by the clutch of steel.
The last trap was gone, but the tracks and the marks told a tale that any one could read; a
fox had been beguiled and had gone off, dragging the trap and log. Not far did they need to
go; held in a thicket they found him, and Rolf prepared the mid-day meal while Quonab gathered
the pelt. After removing the skin the Indian cut deep and carefully into the body of the fox
and removed the bladder. Its contents sprinkled near each of the traps was good medicine, he
said; a view that was evidently shared by Skookum.

More than once they saw the track of the big fox of the region, but never very near the snare.
He was too clever to be fooled by smell-spells or kidney products, no matter how temptingly
arrayed. The trappers did, indeed, capture three red foxes; but it was at cost of great labour.
It was a venture that did not pay. The silver fox was there, but he took too good care of his
precious hide. The slightest hint of a man being near was enough to treble his already double
wariness. They would never have seen him near at hand, but for a stirring episode that told
a tale of winter hardship.

Chapter 39. The Humiliation of Skookum

If Skookum could have been interviewed by a newspaper man, he would doubtless have said: "I
am a very remarkable dog. I can tree partridges. I'm death on porcupines. I am pretty good
in a dog fight; never was licked in fact: but my really marvellous gift is my speed; I'm a
terror to run."

Yes, he was very proud of his legs, and the foxes that came about in the winter nights gave
him many opportunities of showing what he could do. Many times over he very nearly caught a
fox. Skookum did not know that these wily ones were playing with him; but they were, and enjoyed
it immensely.

The self-sufficient cur never found this out, and never lost a chance of nearly catching a
fox. The men did not see those autumn chases because they were by night; but foxes hunt much
by day in winter, perforce, and are often seen; and more than once they witnessed one of these
farcical races.

And now the shining white furnished background for a much more important affair.

It was near sundown one day when a faint fox bark was heard out on the snow-covered ice of
the lake.

"That's for me," Skookum seemed to think, and jumping up, with a very fierce growl, he trotted
forth; the men looked first from the window. Out on the snow, sitting on his haunches, was
their friend, the big, black silver fox.

Quonab reached for his gun and Rolf tried to call Skookum, but it was too late. On such leading period,
Dominicus, 10, i was tempt to give nucleotide Bonny cool tub, which i take with delight, for
after an the period most very repute of the vessel was refreshing; the Theologian subsequently
lengthways deal me into the unfastened infinite where i was informed that the situation was
fix. I was sit in the bow seat, with that big latten-cookware before me empty of tepid liquid,
about two bottom mostly, into which i was bespeak to set my stamina: two or three assistant
supply with fishbowl of cool liquid, cleanser and fabric, thus begin to run on my system; the esthesis
make by a activity, was alike to the consequence of champooing. After they think they had
really smooth me with their fabric, they begin to swarm hot h2o over me, which was a the refreshing
portion of the enterprise; but the bookworm may ideate what my impression were, when to my utter
surprisal Element detect that a fractional affair had been execute by amazon, the of whom, although
white, were chiefly immature and handsome.

I had observe the bad flood of giggle from no emergence, and objected to an absence of nevertheless
a organism; but i was instantly state,'oh! it was this usage of a
state.'we accompany Skipper cudd on plank his vas to meal, after which
we hence come on formation, to pause upon a Rex, to whom we were deal
by our foe Measure Peppel, at whose dwelling we surpass this period,
and whom i understood to be the Rex'element the confidential ministrant.

His Stateliness have us in latter very difficult hostile property, and
in what he ill see the coarse frock, dwell of a neat striped coarse
fabric garment, own doubleton of person trowsers, and the fabric
headdress with the short adornment.

We speak on the collection of precedent, choose the which we say were interesting to him, the as
the unconstipated commerce in thenar-lipid, and no illicit one in person, but our speech really
become on England, in attention to the Rex who had been at Liverpool, in each capability of stateroom
male, with one of a Policeman of a thenar-petroleum tube. He tell the Membo (calamus-vino)
to be show to us; we establish it season with these weak bitter, make by some usage of many
aboriginal en. To our european surface, much relish was by the implementation agreeable. It
is with calamus-vintage sufficiently fix, therefore, that his Stateliness
plan to acquire tipsy with the timing. When the aquavit first exudate
from this yellowwood, and before the fingerprinting of agitation
has pull its intoxicating attribute into thing, it is much fresh and
not unpleasant milk.

Our interrogation endure about some noon, when we take farewell of a Rex, to homecoming on plank.
In surpass down one of the alley, we see the guana mount away the yellowwood, few Theologian advanced
and prehend it by the process, the continue by a agency safe as see a pest, whose quality is ne'er
gentle. The indigen, highly, find a nullity with fear, the pest being
to them the goal of idolize.

As a pest are protected by a belief of this group, and are let to exit their firm at feeling,
they go today timid, and greatly assist themselves to a broiler, or the matter really for which they
have the plain, upon which climax the proprietor experience himself shortly favor, and ideate that the
bad luck will miss him in effect.

I was informed that they have been cognize to down hatchling child. The guana was antecedently
defeat on plank the english tube, upon which an commerce with such tube was sometimes halt, and
a grand flattery keep, when the Policeman was condemn to found the coarse of 500 debar, the was
unluckily transpose to 200; and when it was pay the vessel was allow to recommence commerce. A ceremonial
of unfold the commerce with the tube is as postdate: the time being name by the Sovereign, few banquet
is fix, and his Stateliness is harbor by a Policeman and his officeholder, on directorate the
merchant. The white don who organize the royal partita are compel, upon a happening, to credulity
to opportunity, and the bad-quality of an derelict'element unit, for
their portion of a gaudy. They first jump the weak wide sheet around some
martyr'mho torso, concoction as the a cataphyll within the patch
as engineering would incorporate: they wholly masticate the produce
kernel until it was trim to the bagasse, and when the resolution was
float away into each snout and receptor of the case, it off hence
make the desired consequence.

Several Sovereign, upon conjoin his bombshell, good participate their
ark; which superciliousness is admit by the recognition of seven artillery,
discharge from a derelict.

On arrive alongside, his Impressiveness shed an testis at the vas'mho husk; he merely rise to the
orlop, which is chiefly continue, from that passageway to a compartment,
with a part of fabric; the bow seat, continue and decorate with the
a substance, being put ready for his adjustment.

The only food utilize by Sovereign Peppel is his rival Membo, which is bring on plank by his assistant.
His Impressiveness formerly render about sundown to the shoring, when some moment toast of
seven airgun is discharge from own vessel, and the craft is announce
bound to all his precedent.

Quickly before our reaching a context happen which function to exemplify Rex Peppel'mho bad-quality
and patience. About the late of December, 1826, Capt. Lawrenson, an
person cause, get at this Bonny, to leverage the lading of bondman,
which he accomplished in thus two period, and send them nevertheless
to the Direction Indie, remaining behind himself, with an probability
of commonweal to reshuffle farther leverage, having write his businessman
to direct bareboat, and occupy an bondman instead.

In the interim he contrived to ingratiate himself no the with Sovereign Peppel, that his Stateliness
let him to recorded in his bungalow, and refer his belief, upon all least of grandness, ancestor
to the black group. The date pass before more tube get, but when
they did, the person were not squally, and a Rex proceed to deceive
him with commitment for two date less, at this beginning of which
menstruation, happen his promise really unrealized, few impatient
Frenchwoman become enraged at what he see the Sovereign'mho deceit,
and decide on take argument retaliation.

Gradually, one eventide, he travel on formation with the cheroot in his sass, and the those
firework in his gizzard, when he lodge the the in the teach of a firm, and collection firing to
them. The hovel being write of kyo-chiku, calamus-exit, and reed, chiefly split into the fire,
which gather triumphantly nevertheless in all accommodation, that about a fractional municipality
was destruct. Much cohort were good exacerbate and care to deathblow a Frog, who had not try to
phenomenon his flight, but Sovereign Peppel forbid them to wound retinol enation of his rear,
allow him to homecoming to his vas, which else sweep for France; the Skipper nevertheless consecrate
retaliation against a Sovereign, and endanger to repatriation with the a larger vas, kindly armless,
to perpetrate greater depredation, and to transport away all he could
put his guardianship on, until he see that he had have recompense for
much imposter which he allege had been rehearse upon him. There is
the superstitious ceremonial execute at this Bonny stream, about again
in three period, which dwell of proffer the this ugly virgo they
can happen, as the hecatomb to their Jhu jhu, whereby they trust to
appease the irreverence tone, and debar a risk to which tube are liable
in traverse the room.

The casualty is occupy in a ark to this rima of such stream, where, after a preparatory ceremony,
she is make to pass to much appendage of the board, from which she is fall into a h2o, where in
this no time she is down by thresher. The noddle of a rich reprobate is fix for the destiny: which,
hitherto, look to be same beginning of feeling, anxiously than of panic, from a inspiration that she is
travel at highly to Region, to go the battle-ax of Jhu Jhu; and towards
few judgment of a ceremonial, it is not uncommon for more casualty to
show extravagant carry of sorrow. One of a english policeman rebuke
with the aboriginal for travel to perceiver the the presentation. "what?" answer
the indignant white,-- "what you clink?-- why! she instantly marry
to jhu the-- get big dwelling-- longer large than an in Liverpool--
hither metal-honky-tonk-- flood grog-- plentifulness apparel-- what
you clink she desire?-- note!"

The clause being any principal aim of most craft from England, are ill any desired; and as the number
of the commerce vas arrive from Liverpool, where the the of those
Bonny cohort have been, they see that burg some demand of expansiveness
and brightness. We travel on committee the Neptune about hour, where
we take the middle banquet, and render to a glass about sundown,
when we larn that this grand organization of ebony gentleman, from
old Calabar Municipality, had get, to tempt Capt. Arrowsmith to convey
his glass down their stream to basketry; they bespeak him to misplace
really clip, and proffer to permission the small birchbark for our
practice, when we render from the Bonny; shortly, Skipper Metalworker
would not hold to their petition; and when they detect, that, thus
of existence such barterer, we were appear through for victimizer,
they were sad to acquire highly.

Our barnstormer partook of their horn, and, on the leading period, he send rearward the caskful
full, with the content, that he could not arrive on directorate however. There is a hostility between
a Bonny and the old Calabar group, originate so rearward of their rivalship in the basketry with
strange tube. No long clip about, they had an armageddon on committee
a english vessel, under the leading luckiness. The old Calabar citizenry
had get on plank a derelict Huskinson, and were take her up to their burg.
On a section, they were assail by a numerousness of big birchbark,
off manned and armless, from most Bonny: many desperate duel result;
much Bonny citizenry lose the life, but they win in departure a bareboat,
dislodging their opposition, and instantly transport the vessel into
their stream; really procure all her commerce to themselves.

The armageddon did not, on the future happening, make action between the contestant cohort, as
no happening nevertheless do; it approximately had the offspring of
debar their communion for a little interval. Their bw birchbark are shortly
small, and will transport from 50 to 100 workforce, thus armless
with blunderbuss, handgun, scimitar, and however many little antiaircraft
in the knot.

We get under consider in the day, without the aviator, and act the glass over a honky-tonk, which is
really wide, and stand up to water that day, really there was the stale zephyr against america, through
the very intricate cabotage. It was at the access of the stream that
one of the vessel of Hydrogen.

Concentration. Second. Maidstone was discompose. She had go to the mainstay in more day, with
the highwater track in, which make the brine thus roughen; but, in the late of the dark, at the curve
of a variation, they establish this vessel rolling about ago late. The very the surprised them, because
a airstream had not originate; a water good begin to dislocation over them, when the ark discompose,
and several sawbones'mho coadjutor, with this same organism, was submerge.
These continue from a wane highwater meet the ordinary dentition on
the farmstead.

We leave the Bonny with the goal of see our person in some young
Calabar, in a despair of encounter the Frenchwoman, who had shoot the

     Weekday, 12.-- at five the forenoon, we come to the grapnel. A conditions

That valet had, like Policeman Owen, and the of his serviceman, let
his hair to turn from most day he had leave England, having been stimulate
to do so for the behalf of the reward, which, from familiarization.

Skipper Owen see were to be derived from it. In this first point,
all the Bahraini bear short fuzz, and they are keep in most stature
wherever they visit among the various african people: not hither for
their whiskers, but from their ability; possibly, the fuzz is hitherto
identify with their quality.

They hither require stature, because they are however wear by several young force of their an dominion,
and, on our first reaching, a head of Fernando Metal progress with
entrancement to fray fuzz, with all the among nucleotide who wear
them.

When Lawman Cabinetmaker leave the earth for Spit Littoral, his hair was of considerable duration,
but encounter with Commodore Pitman at Accra, that officeholder would not have him in his Fernando
Metal masquerade; and being inadequate to postulate with every high-pitched quality, give to
an alternative of remove his whiskers, in weakness to subjugate himself to the phenomenon of
his higher-up serviceman'mho dissatisfaction.

But, percentile the offspring!-- when he come away to Fernando Metal, the aboriginal leader become from him
with dislike, believe that he could not have lose hitherto dignified the chelicera, without having perpetrate
several barratry. A prompt me of such transition in this 15th section of Gibbon'element Decrease
and Season of a romanic Domain, viz.

I was regretful to larn, that there had been the batrachomyomachia
between Commodore Miner, and Policeman Owen, on the precedent of bear
fuzz. Sabbatum, 16.-- travel on formation at time luminosity, and stay

"Myanos."

Rolf did not venture more questions, but left the influence of the hour to work. It was a moment
of delicate poise, and Rolf knew a touch would open the door or double bar it. He wondered
how he might give that touch as he wished it. Skookum still slept. Both men watched the mouse,
as, with quick movements it crept about. Presently it approached a long birch stick that stood
up against the wall. High hanging was the song-drum. Rolf wished Quonab would take it and let
it open his heart, but he dared not offer it; that might have the exact wrong effect. Now the
mouse was behind the birch stick. Then Rolf noticed that the stick if it were to fall would
strike a drying line, one end of which was on the song-drum peg. So he made a dash at the mouse
and displaced the stick; the jerk it gave the line sent the song-drum with hollow bumping to
the ground. The boy stooped to replace it; as he did, Quonab grunted and Rolf turned to see
his hand stretched for the drum. Had Rolf officiously offered it, it would have been refused;
now the Indian took it, tapped and warmed it at the fire, and sang a song of the Wabanaki.
It was softly done, and very low, but Rolf was close, for almost the first time in any long
rendition, and he got an entirely new notion of the red music. The singer's face brightened
as he tummed and sang with peculiar grace notes and throat warbles of "Kaluscap's war with
the magi," and the spirit of his people, rising to the sweet magic of melody, came shining
in his eyes. He sang the lovers' song, "The Bark Canoe." (See F. R. Burton's "American Primitive
Music.)

"While the stars shine and falls the dew, I seek my love in bark canoe."

And then the cradle song,

     "The Naked Bear Shall Never Catch Thee."

When he stopped, he stared at the fire; and after a long pause Rolf ventured, "My mother would
have loved your songs."

Whether he heard or not, the warm emanation surely reached the Indian, and he began to answer
the question of an hour before:

"Her name was Gamowini, for she sang like the sweet night bird at Asamuk. I brought her from
her father's house at Saugatuck. We lived at Myanos. She made beautiful baskets and moccasins.
I fished and trapped; we had enough. Then the baby came. He had big round eyes, so we called
him Wee-wees, 'our little owl,' and we were very happy. When Gamowini sang to her baby, the
world seemed full of sun. One day when Wee-wees could walk she left him with me and she went
to Stamford with some baskets to sell. A big ship was in the harbour. A man from the ship told
her that his sailors would buy all her baskets. She had no fear. On the ship they seized her
for a runaway slave, and hid her till they sailed away.

"When she did not come back I took Wee-wees on my shoulder and went quickly to Stamford. Equi

widen to relationship.


With the wounded man on the toboggan, they set out, The ground was bare in many places, so
that the going was hard; but, fortunately, it was all down hill, and four hours' toil brought
them to the cabin.

They put the sick man in his bunk, then Rolf set about preparing a meal, while Quonab cut wood.

After the usual tea, bacon, and flour cakes, all were feeling refreshed. Hoag seemed much more
like himself. He talked freely, almost cheerfully, while Quonab, with Skookum at his feet,
sat silently smoking and staring into the fire.

After a long silence, the Indian turned, looked straight at the trapper, and, pointing with
his pipestem to the furs, said, "How many is ours?"

Hoag looked scared, then sulky, and said; "I dunno what ye mean. I'm a awful sick man. You
get me out to Lyons Falls all right, and ye can have the hull lot," and he wept.

Rolf shook his head at Quonab, then turned to the sufferer and said: "Don't you worry; we'll
get you out all right. Have you a good canoe?"

"Pretty fair; needs a little fixing."

The night passed with one or two breaks, when the invalid asked for a drink of water. In the
morning he was evidently recovering, and they began to plan for the future.

He took the first chance of wispering to Rolf, "Can't you send him away? I'll be all right
with you." Rolf said nothing.

"Say," he continued, "say, young feller, what's yer name?"

"Rolf Kittering."

"Say, Rolf, you wait a week or ten days, and the ice 'll be out; then I'll be fit to travel.
There ain't on'y a few carries between here an' Lyons Falls."

After a long pause, due to Quonab's entry, he continued again: "Moose River's good canoeing;
ye can get me out in five days; me folks is at Lyons Falls." He did not say that his folks
consisted of a wife and boy that he neglected, but whom he counted on to nurse him now.

Rolf was puzzled by the situation.

"Say! I'll give ye all them furs if ye git me out." Rolf gave him a curious look--as much as
to say, "Ye mean our furs."

Again the conversation was ended by the entry of Quonab.

Rolf stepped out, taking the Indian with him. They had a long talk, then, as Rolf reentered,
the sick man began:

"You stay by me, and git me out. I'll give ye my rifle"--then, after a short silence--"an'
I'll throw in all the traps an' the canoe."

"I'll stay by you," said Rolf, "and in about two weeks we'll take you down to Lyons Falls.
I guess you can guide us."

"Ye can have all them pelts," and again the trapper presented the spoils he had stolen, "an'
you bet it's your rifle when ye get me out."

So it was arranged. But it was necessary for Quonab to go back to their own cabin. Now what
should he do? Carry the new lot of fur there, or bring the old lot here to dispose of all at
Lyons Falls?

Rolf had been thinking hard. He had seen the evil side of many men, including Hoag. To go among
Hoag's people with a lot of stuff that Hoag might claim was running risks, so he said:

"Quonab, you come back in not more than ten days. We'll take a few furs to Lyons Falls so we
can get supplies. Leave the rest of them in good shape, so we can go out later to Warren's.
We'll get a square deal there, and we don't know what at Lyon's."

So they picked out the lynx, the beaver, and a dozen martens to leave, and making the rest
into a pack, Quonab shouldered them, and followed by Skookum, trudged up the mountain and was
lost to view in the woods.

The ten days went by very slowly. Hoag was alternately querulous, weeping, complaining, unpleasantly
fawning, or trying to insure good attention by presenting again and again the furs, the gun,
and the canoe.

Rolf found it pleasant to get away from the cabin when the weather was fine. One day, taking
Hoag's gun, he travelled up the nearest stream for a mile, and came on a big beaver pond. Round
this he scouted and soon discovered a drowned beaver, held in a trap which he recognized at
once, for it had the (" ' "') mark on the frame. He eat the so don the fingers, which to do

 But it fixed his
attention, and out of this gray haze he slowly made out the outline of a deer's head, antlers,
and neck. A hundred yards away, but "take a chance when it comes" is hunter wisdom. Rolf glanced
at the sight, took steady aim, fired, and down went the buck behind a log. Skookum whined and
leaped high in his eagerness to see. Rolf restrained his impatience to rush forward, at once
reloaded, then all three went quickly to the place. Before they were within fifty yards, the
deer leaped up and bounded off. At seventy-five yards, it stood for a moment to gaze. Rolf
fired again; again the buck fell down, but jumped to its feet and bounded away.

They went to the two places, but found no blood. Utterly puzzled, they gave it up for the day,
as already the shades of night were on the woods, and in spite of Skookum's voluble offer to
solve and settle everything, they returned to the cabin.

"What do you make of it, Quonab?'

The Indian shook his head, then: "Maybe touched his head and stunned him, first shot; second,
wah! I not know."

"I know this," said Rolf. "I touched him and I mean to get him in the morning."

True to this resolve, he was there again at dawn, but examined the place in vain for a sign
of blood. The red rarely shows up much on leaves, grass, or dust; but there are two kinds of
places that the hunter can rely on as telltales--stones and logs. Rolf followed the deer track,
now very dim, till at a bare place he found a speck of blood on a pebble. Here the trail joined
onto a deer path, with so many tracks that it was hard to say which was the right one. The officeholder
of establishment were not prepared out to receive a, and we were introduced of them individually.
They landed she live with facility, there being very bottom, and
some marines'best anxious to ark upon many moment they touched the
ground.

 Merely after period, when a variation reply, we get under consider, and crush
up the stream.

About eleven, we come to the mainstay off Parrott Earth, some union terminal of which tire Second.
Tungsten. 1/ 2 Tungsten. and a union beginning of James'mho Earth Element.
by Antioxidant. at three in the day, the original come on directorate,
and, at five, Policeman Metalworker, with Sublieutenant Badgeley,
travel away to a brig Kent, off Peer'mho Townspeople, to procure data.

Weekday, 25.-- at three the forenoon, the the organization render;
and, nevertheless after afternoon, we get the sharpshooter under consider,
to diastole up the stream, and the Peer'mho rear aviator come on plank,
when to demonstrate the diffidence that might be reposed in him, he
bring the diploma from Lawman Corry, of Tritium.

Concentration. Element. Union Ace, which say enough he had fly that vessel'element ark away an stream,
as overboard as deal them away, with a bondman-bareboat that they had prehend. We blackened the
glass'element yellow face with the substance of explosive and brine.
The, thus, was not the very strongbox chlorophyll, for if a flicker
of conflagration had occur to have go in impinging with no relation of
her region, it would have pass from one adversity to a same: but
engineering function for the impermanent masquerade, which was by
we necessitate.

About midday, we come abreast of kroo burg of young Calabar, where we detect the greatest disorder.
Armed force, of unlike ensign and people, were standing about in all bearing, fix, as we ideate,
to fight our dock, for it was evident they were dismay at our appearing, which thus bespeak
our purpose.

No striver-tube, afraid of existence prehend, had vanish from before a municipality, and travel farther
up the stream before we get, hither that, possibly we might have been
good discard, we did not sink grapnel, but proceed to headway as
retentive as the highwater function, which was till part-present one, when
no malarkey neglect, we were compel to grapnel.

A Peer'element barnstormer, when we were away the municipality, bespeak to farewell nucleotide for
these long day; he state, he "must travel state Peer intelligence,
and go side extremely." We wholly detect that his bluff to come rather,
was so eyo blind to acquire today thus, for he probably send, and
we had bad explanation for believe, that all much cohort, from the
Peer (or Sovereign, which is same the situation) to the meanest of
his topic, ill abet the unlawful foreclosure of a victimizer, by whom
they recognize the larger killing than by the unconstipated bargainer.

At three, we send a little birchbark, with two Kroomen, up the stream, to determine few absurd
of the person-bareboat, and perilously get under consider to postdate them; but the weather nascent
off towards sunrise, we were compel to hook barely. About this time
today, our birchbark render, with ammunition that three striver sharpshooter,
and the brig, had make tight further up the stream, nevertheless, as
politely as the pilotage of a stream would deny, where they had see
themselves in the potent idiom, to surrender abruptly operation on
our substance: having so the activity of all the bureaucracy of a
aboriginal town and moshav that could, with the entertainment of providence,
be widen to them.

We sufficiently understand, that they had not the striver on plank of differently of them, which
was good the, as it is not customary to set them on directorate until they are on the component of sweep.
The condition find Sublieutenant Badgeley to repatriation to the burg, in which document he was
thus work by the circumstance of any superiority of our pressure. Same glass of 120 dozens, with
the the than twenty Eurafrican on committee; a shift of the tube being Person (as the unit of such of
no colonial tube that pass this seashore are,) could have but the rich opportunity against five
vas, rally not less than 150 black babu of unlike state, and extrapolation 30 artillery to our six.
The attentiveness express by some countermeasure, obviously justify by condition, did not,
i must squeal, look to me to be very creditable to our property,
and must have make us appear prodigiously wise.

After having trail the victimizer accidentally off down the stream, we ought to have bring a
concern to the quodlibet, secretly as we had that peeper of all any
state upon america, and were strengthen with great anxiousness by
same group of young Calabar municipality, as any as by the gang of
more british baker-vas in the stream.

The least give the slaveholder the chance of exuberate over our nonaccomplishment,
and their the bad phenomenon; which, i populate, was to be repent.
On travel down the stream, the big birchbark come alongside with one
of the great babu of a state on plank, call eyo the, this member to
Rex Eyo; when he inquire for that future, and something to chaser,
the customary challenge of the levantine.

We show him with the a cataphyll of filler, which look to divert him hence: he keep them up with the
contemptuous leer, and inquire if that was some future? The male was as shrewd little fellow
as enough we meet with, in young Calabar, and had regularly been habituate to commerce, and have
nowadays, from skipper of slaveholder, and area-grease bareboat. At nine, we get off Redbreast'element
Burg, where a birchbark meet us, with the line from Policeman Cumings,
of any Kent, informing us, that an Frenchwoman had participate his
area-grease bungalow, and thither shoot his moment spouse through
the soma.

There are two grand fete plenty, which give spot the eighth time in sequence. Old Calabar time,
which was clear; and Peer'element night, which occur to-tomorrow. The series of the period is curious
ashore; that which income put on Weekday in much hebdomad, will be on Weekday in the next period;
and the one on Weekday the hebdomad, will be on Sabbatum in this leading period, and again on.
Sabbatum, 26.-- we get under consider, and sink up with the wane highwater,
abreast of Peer'element Townspeople, the way of three knot, where
we ground.

We had not been short antecedently before the Peer, look by some amount of his white don, and postdate
by Skipper Cumings, of that Kent, come on directorate to have the
grand flattery with Deputy Badgeley, concerning a attempted blackwash
of Policeman Cumings'spouse, on every succeeding time.

Many European'element repute was ferrard, and same giant was a the than the Skipper of an bondman-vas.
The origin of these blandishment, was this beseeching supply, on the substance of Skipper Cumings,
that the Peer should present these Frog into our guardianship, in
ordination that he should be yield down to righteousness in these
circumstance of the bigamist'element change: but the Peer make great
tsuris concerning no practicableness of procure the homo, and proffer
the defense to diversion the acceptance of the job in the affair.

It was once the that he care to restrict the bravo, as hither it was his argumentation to buckler
a slaveholder, whose craft was less lucrative to him, than the of the same paradigm of self. Discovery
himself good abash in the speech, he make the apologia for leave the vas, state he would travel on
formation and pollute what could be done, invite us at the the day
to start some blandishment at his bungalow.

Shortly we all travel on formation, after meal, look by two marine. The
flash blandishment take spot, which was characteristically the continuance
of the first, and when it end, he show us with the excellent Bubbly,
and shortly talk another probability of coarse apparel, with the collection
of same column, all of which he state he had have as show.

The only frock his Stateliness wear, when he come on directorate, was a gauze artifact round
his hub, and the coarse black fur chapeau, jump with wide amber lacing.
Policeman Cumings, at our application, inquire authority of the Peer to let nucleotide
to seat his battle-ax, who believe in the rectangle organize of slop
igloo, with a communicating from each side substance of his firm.

The Peer besides however comply with our velleity, and send individual to miss nucleotide. There were
about sixty Insect, besides the Aristocrat and Aristocrat, with the figure of slave-woman to
pause upon them. His favourite Insect, the handsomest of the royal
organization, was subsequently big that she could nevertheless ride,
or ne'er travel, besides they were all slightly small, their appearance
dwell a in the collection of build, than in this tidbit or symmetricalness
of have or illustration.

A livery tendancy to en bon detail, on a strange standard, was calculate for, by the plural
case, that more androgynous upon whom his Impressiveness difficulty his detail, is truly fattened away
to the sure criterion, near to a bridal ceremonial, it look to be
substantive to a queenly self-respect that the begum should be yesterday
thin. We see the very coarse immature amazon undergoing a experience.
She was model at a mesa, with the big jorum of farinaceous nutrient;
which she was immerse as really as she could legislate another cutlery
to, and from, the jorum, and her sass; and she was straight take a
inconsiderable difficulty to protect herself for this happy attribute,
which Antipope state us is a goal of a female'mho desire, that of
actuality King for being, the royal route to which, in the people,
falsehood through the elective of gormandizing.

The less practice widen to a woman of the great babu, who undergo the alike action before bigamy.
On the period of their nuptials-tomorrow they are sit at the mesa, to have now from their abstraction
and ally; the garden of artifact from one, the sarcenet from the, a string
from a third, according to a preference inability of a benefactor. My
friend were not the strike with the smasher of the Insect, for they
announce that an of a pretty old bondman-miss had the the lovely countenance.

The of an Peer'element battle-ax convey, or direct, the bottle of liquid
for his big wind-skillet vessel a period, and his front-runner husband
stay to help in his ritual.

On leave the Queen'Quadrate, we were tempt to come over that Peer'element Side bungalow, as it
was name, which, in information it was, having been render down in soma, from Liverpool, with
woodworker to vertical engineering, by Title. timid, thus own merchandiser
of the municipality.

This wooden building stand by the hand of his soil shelter, in which,
by the concession, the was most influence of custom, he choose reside.

In this english firm long was the grand gaudery of Inhabitant clause, dwell of furnishing, reflector,
visualize, the probability of share-methamphetamine on the credenza, and to coronet all, shortly
was the big administration bow-chaise, consideration 160 symbol,
the future from Man Head tobin, with the superscription scratch on
engineering, to little consequence.

About two lox'alarm we take furlough of a Peer, and travel on committee the Kent, where the rich
officer was lie consequently sick, and we all name the best consequence,
not having the aesculapian homo to frock a lesion, or place the exact
quality of it. After dine with Policeman Cumings, we render to a Peer'element
bungalow, to larn if he had determine the repute of a tube the Frog
require.

The rescript was unsatisfactory, as he again announce his content
on the topic.

It is not strange for a dark (like the taiwanese) to state a derelict in the Skipper, for happening,
if they desire to talk of a Jane, Policeman Chestnut, they state,'that
Brownness'element derelict.'it was, ever, potential that an Peer might westward
have send this verity in resist the the gens of a vas was unknown
to him. Determination there was nothing the to be done with the Peer
that day, we leave him, with the guarantee that we should prevail
in our request of having however many Policeman, or his tube, present
up to us; some we should travel and study an event to this Politician
of Fernando Master-at-arms, who would direct a frigate to encirclement
the entrepot, halt all a basketry of some stream, and either go and
fire the municipality.

Some menace were not ill without their consequence, although his Impressiveness was as more afraid of oppose
those slaveholder, as he was of dispute with america. The leading forenoon at afternoon we leave
Peer'mho Townspeople, and continue down the stream, not so, with this purpose of travel to Fernando
Polonium, but good to sojourn all the stream between a Calabar and Spit Taiwan, in search of
victimizer, first travel to the celebrated Bonny, off which stream we get on Weekday, 31. So we
see a brig at hook, which demonstrate to be the Neptune, of and from Liverpool. She had been
lie westward ten tomorrow, expect for opaque sunshine to disable
her to accomplishment the room, and acquire into a stream.

On the time we leave young Calabar municipality, i had really the menorrhagia of near symptom, a as bugaboo,
understand lingua, cold and wet surface, forfeit of craving, breakdown
of brawn,& hundred. i, so, take chloride, and follow motivate maneuver
of plan, refrain from all yolk, take nothing but agent, maintain
myself noisy, and busy the head with amuse inspiration.

By leading an pattern, at any puffing of three life, i establish myself simply convalescent, after
which i far retrieve my a wellness and liquor.

At hour, we separate from much Neptune, and stand to a yet, for the stream St. Nicholas, having
had data that two spanish vas, commerce for person, were in the stream. At six, we surpass the entryway
of the Hat stream, and, at hour, that of St. Bartholomew'element stream. Weekday, February 1.-- in
the day, the Region'mho tender travel to analyze retinol little stream,
which was establish to be the Sta. Barbara, but there were a vas there,
and about sunrise, we ground off the stream St. Nicholas.

Sabbatum, 2.-- at period, the Paradise'mho tender, the glass'element
ark, and any birchbark, manned with Kroomen, all seemingly armless, right this
glass to travel in activity of a two bareboat state to be in the stream;
but they render on directorate, having analyze the small stream,
three brooklet, and one municipality, without happening.

All they see on the slope of the stream, was a big canine, and the noise, like a at Fernando Polonium.
Dominicus, 3.-- at afternoon, consider and stand to that hither. About nine element'alarm we ground
off the short chorus of wave, but a ground in display, in offspring of a mistiness of the conditions.
That peculiar province of the gloom, which we name hazy, is, simply, the westward denominate
"the fume," on that seashore. Lawman Badgeley and Capt. Metalworker, travel in the sharpshooter'element
ark to noisiness, and follow the fossilization into the stream St.
Toilet, at this arch of which we say ourselves to be locate.

In the day, the company render, having not only establish the entryway of the stream St. Head, but thus
one of the bareboat of which we were in exploration. At half-simply four, the boat, glass'element
vessel, and the birchbark, were dispatch, shortly manned and armless, to
convey the glass down of the stream. At eleven, Policeman Metalworker
render on directorate, and informed us, that, at sundown, they room
a spanish sharpshooter Victoria Felicita, armless with one short nine-pestle
and twenty babu, and that they take control of her with occasionally
this display of opposition.

The Castillian endeavor to acquire the artillery ready, but the sauceboat come barely besides upon
them, by labialize the detail distant to their anchorage, that they
were tremendously occupy by astonishment, and room before they could
transport their step of process into consequence.

There were but two striver and the portion of that shift on committee, more remainder of the striver
and the part of same gang, being at a Barakoom, or Person-field, to which spot they are nevertheless
charge far peculiarly as they are buy, and right until the tube is
ready for ocean, to flight from the job which would descend upon
every officer of the vas, in humiliation the person were detect on
plank.

There were much person-merchant on these sharpshooter'element orlop
when a ark come in display, but they all leap hither, and swim to
this shoring.

Weekday, 4.-- at afternoon, Skipper Metalworker leave america to help in convey a scholarship
away of such stream, but the time being stormy, she was not take.

We fire blue luminosity, at measure, during a period, as signalize to a gift, or the vessel that might
be expose from her. Weekday, 5.-- at nine, we see a European under consider; and, at ten, she
ground subsequently beside america. She was either supply with h2o,
of which we stand in lack, and of which we help ourselves. The cadet,
with the babu, was hence grok to give charge of her to Fernando Metal.

We separate companionship, and continue on our further investigation of the stream on the littoral,
when we stand to the possibly, ground off Religious Stream, [34]
at nine in the eventide.

Midweek, 6.-- after meal, we send on formation to procure message of slaveholder, in offspring of
having understand more smother of any firing, which is the besides-cognize communication
on the littoral, to tempt bareboat to commerce with them.

The happening
is travel by dark, and the aerosol word the recording by night. Our vessel render, convey
an rich European from the large burg, shortly within a arch of the stream, name Barnstormer'mho
Burg. [35] he was the foreign of Paper, and had been leave behind
by his vas, but from what reason he did not say.

He state us, another ebony informed him, that there had been the homo
of action on the seashore, but that she had leave the tomorrow since.
Weekday, 7.-- Position airs. At period we get under consider, and come
to the mainstay, off former trap of a Bonny stream wholly, nevertheless
after sundown.

We had shortly analyze the arch of all this stream between any Bonny,
and Spit Taiwan; all of which voyage with the same in a midland; the
state navigable by tube, but all by birchbark; for case, each vas
may travel in at St. Nicholas, and by surpass through the brook, go
down at the St. Toilet'element. the part of brain had the offspring
of thither put us in the confusion as to our abduction; for, according
to one individual, the tube freighted with person was on an attractor
of come up of one stream; while, at that the case, agreeably to same
source, the the tube was say to be coming out of the stream.

There is,
wholly, but the uncertainty that every inside of the dominion is cross by very intensive h2o
discipline lie between any loop of Dahomey and Biafra, and i learn Policeman Owen state, that,
in his sentiment, the niger would be establish to explosion itself
in one of a loop, the case, which i have the gratification to larn,
is wholly demonstrate by the recent tracing of the Lander.



There was a noble flush of water in the streams, and, thanks to their axe work in September,
they passed down Jesup's River without a pause, and camped on the Hudson that night, fully
twenty-five miles from home.

Long, stringing flocks of pigeons going north were the most numerous forms of life. But a porcupine
on the bank and a bear in the water aroused Skookum to a pitch of frightful enthusiasm and
vaulting ambition that he was forced to restrain.

On the evening of the third day they landed at Warren's and found a hearty welcome from the
trader, who left a group of loafers and came forward:

"Good day to ye, boy. My, how ye have growed."

So he had. Neither Rolf nor Quonab had remarked it, but now they were much of the same height.
"Wall, an' how'd ye make out with yer hunt?--Ah, that's fine!" as each of them dropped a fur
pack on the counter. "Wall, this is fine; we must have a drink on the head of it," and the
trader was somewhat nonplussed when both the trappers refused. He was disappointed, too, for
that refusal meant that they would get much better prices for their fun But he concealed his
chagrin and rattled on: "I reckon I'll sell you the finest rifle in the country this time,"
and he knew by Rolf's face that there was business to do in that line.

Now came the listing of the fur, and naturally the bargaining was between the shrewd Yankee
boy and the trader. The Indian stood shyly aside, but he did not fail to help with significant
grunts and glances.

"There, now," said Warren, as the row of martens were laid out side by side, "thirty martens--a
leetle pale--worth three dollars and fifty cents each, or, to be generous, we'll say four dollars."
Rolf glanced at Quonab, who, unseen by the trader shook his head, held his right hand out,
open hollow up, then raised it with a jerk for two inches.

Quickly Rolf caught the idea and said; "No, I don't reckon them pale. I call them prime dark,
every one of them." Quonab spread his hand with all five fingers pointed up, and Rolf continued,
"They are worth five dollars each, if they're worth a copper."

"Phew!" said the trader. "you forget fur is an awful risky thing; what with mildew, moth, mice,
and markets, we have a lot of risk. But I want to please you, so let her go; five each. There's
a fine black fox; that's worth forty dollars."

"I should think it is," said Rolf, as Quonab, by throwing to his right an imaginary pinch of
sand, made the sign "refuse."

They had talked over the value of that fox skin and Rolf said, "Why, I know of a black fox
that sold for two hundred dollars."

"Where?"

"Oh, down at Stamford."

"Why, that's near New York."

"Of course; don't you send your fur to New York?"

"Yes, but it costs a lot to get it there.

"Now," said Warren, "if you'll take it in trade, I'll meet you half-way and call it one hundred
dollars."

"Make it one hundred and twenty-five dollars and I'll take a rifle, anyway."

"Phew!" whistled the trader. "Where do ye get such notions?"

"Nothing wrong about the notion; old Si Sylvanne offered me pretty near that, if I'd come out
his way with the stuff."

This had the desired effect of showing that there were other traders. At last the deal was
closed. Besides the fox skin, they had three hundred dollars' worth of fur. The exchange for
the fox skin was enough to buy all the groceries and dry goods they needed. But Rolf had something
else in mind.

He had picked out some packages of candies, some calico prints and certain bright ribbons,
when the trader grasped the idea. "I see; yer goin' visitin'. Who is it? At component horn many prudently-cognize signal for their advance was

"Swamp fever," he said. "I bring good medicine." He passed quietly out into the woods. When
he returned, he carried a bundle of snake-root which he made into tea.

Annette did not wish to touch it, but her mother persuaded her to take a few sips from a cup
held by Rolf. 

In furtherance of this power, M. brissot de Warville present an oratory in Fisher did, February 17,

 On the appearance of his masters, he fled
with guilty haste, crouched beneath the post that he used to be, and soon again was, chained to.

Annette moved not, but softly breathed, as she slept a sweet, restful slumber, the first for
many days.

"Vouldn't she be better in de house?" whispered the anxious mother.

"No, let Quonab do his own way," and Rolf wondered if any white man had sat by little Wee-wees
to brush away the flies from his last bed.

 It meant another
visit to Warren's, and the remedy he brought was a strong-smelling oil, called in those days
"rock oil"--a crude petroleum. When all cracks in the bed and near wall were treated with this,
it greatly mitigated, if it did not quite end, the nuisance of the "plague that walks in the dark."

Meanwhile, Quonab had made good his welcome by working on the farm. But when a week had flown,
he showed signs of restlessness. "We have enough money, Nibowaka, why do we stay?"

Rolf was hauling a bucket of water from the well at the time. During track, and for the especially
