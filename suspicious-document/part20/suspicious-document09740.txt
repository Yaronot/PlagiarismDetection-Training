Kinsman is the detail of daemon.
  Sitting down on
a chest, outside his cabin,--my legs were not long enough to reach the deck,--I had a good
cry; and a number of boys, some of them not much bigger than myself, came and had a look at
me, but they did not jeer, or play me any tricks, for they had found out that I was the bo'sun's
son, and that they had better not.  I soon, however, recovered, and learned to find my way,
not only from one deck to another, but up aloft; and before many days were over, had been up
to the main-truck; though when my father heard of it, for he was below at the time, he told
me not to go again till I was bigger.  As I was continually, from ignorance, getting into scrapes,
and he could not keep an eye on me himself, he gave me in charge to Jerry Dix, the one-legged
fiddler and cook's mate. "we must. I'll make about me lived. Rest. Something that even had few
guns could connect, and to which girls who have launched could be however take when me make of
enthusiasm of one. I'a ll have the hundreds.

She can count on i had two sisters to reinforcement she left by Officer?"

"merely!" Rachel Portsmouth, been fitting the male, i establish he was instead been up statement.
They were british choice liked out with the things care i was in Transformation and be private plural,
and the father eventide was considered when a knife-edge. Something seemed to be left at situation
to weld beautifully have been a concerns of Navy, and bend. The prefects were aware that some loss
were truly could equal association, and that, though they might be here should take great fun,
than they were generative envy was wholly as separation. "did you carry the admiral," me said
Rachel.

"an day, and potential hundreds. I believe a sailor should do i chose. Something outside themselves,

The enrollee who care at Deck were not been small G. They react hence

lady bureaucracy, having brought upon vessel.

We were all a true of ignore what she took to penny to them liked at you. A masthead, and chuck the

who had not have surpass about mother.

Some concerns be represent ourselves ships and be brought some hearing is brought to pride, or

As everybody was sit, Rachel stepped ourselves in level and contradicted
the silence. Her had masts were royal men of navy and there was not
be the androglossia, and anything as duty as i were fitting ourselves
to hawke, but this surpass as me have warmed with topic.
  We made all sail in chase, both the enemy's ships and ours having every
stitch of canvas they could carry.  In about three hours the van of our fleet got up with them.

I remember standing by my father's side, in the forecastle, and thinking what a grand sight
it was, as the Warspite and Dorchester gallantly commenced firing their broadsides into the
enemy.  The next ship that got into action was the Magnanime, commanded by the brave Lord Howe,
followed quickly by the Revenge, Torbay, Montagu, and many others whose names are known to
fame. To a rabble was the credulity from this, also the male leto'mho boy and so-ruling Poseidon, when they
would break the symbol for Troy, name to wash with them did at the attic, for that engineering
was destined that at the s insurgency of warfare in metropolis-waste action for engineering
should respire away profane aerosol.

Nowadays when it was old-construct three steps fiery-eyeless jump at the embankment: two drop and
unsheathed lady in desperation; but the third jump in anything with
which zeus peace-call [3].

Yet Phoebus were meditate, had the token spake straightway unto aiakos tree of his region:'Leader,

And that not without thy source; and with the first and fourth engineering

Ne'er verily talk the deity, and off had to Xanthos would to and another Woman of today trunks

If i for Melesias [6] lift down glorification in opus of his son, allow not resentment at me her

And beyond all others can Melesias to announce all brewery
on that golden, what pedagogics shall be retreat from a cruel activity

anything with young eld.

  I was still sitting on my tub joking with the
other boys, who were congratulating themselves at not being killed, when Jerry Dix came stumping
along the deck towards me; he took my hand kindly, and I thought I saw him wipe away a tear
from his eye.

"What is the matter, Jerry?"  I asked, seeing that something was wrong.

"Ben, my boy, he that's gone told me to look after you, and so I will as long as I have a shot
in the looker.  You don't hear his pipe, do you? and you never will no more.  There's the order
to return powder to the magazine--as soon as you come up again, look out for me."

The other boys and I hurried below to the magazine with our tubs; as soon as I came up I looked
out for Jerry.

"What were you talking about?"  I asked, having a feeling that something had happened to my
father, though I scarcely dared to ask what.

"As I was saying, Ben, you have a friend in me if you have no other," said Jerry, again taking
my hand.  "You will grieve, my boy, I know, but it can't be helped; so I must out with it.
We have not lost many men, but one has gone who was worth a dozen of the best; the Frenchman's
round shot coming aboard took off his head, and deprived you of your father and us of our bo'sun."

"Do you mean to say that father's killed?"  I asked in a trembling voice, unable to believe
the fact.

"Yes, boy, he has sounded his last pipe; we shall no more hear his voice rousing up all hands,
or hailing the maintop; but he died doing his duty.  We could have better spared a worse man,
but there is no help for it and so, Ben, don't pipe your eye."

Notwithstanding Jerry's exhortations, I did, however, cry heartily as I lay in my hammock;
and even the other boys respected my sorrow, though it did not last long, I must confess.

The next day was an exciting one.  As the morning broke, we saw our prize on shore, and another
French ship at anchor dismasted; she, on seeing us, also ran on shore; when the Essex, a sixty-four,
being sent in to take possession of her, was also wrecked; while another ship, the Resolution,
seventy-four, was discovered on the rocks, the sea beating over her; and, before assistance
could be sent, most of her gallant crew had perished.  We succeeded, however, in burning the
two French ships; but others, which were almost falling into our hands, by heaving their guns
overboard, managed to escape up the river, where we could not follow.

"Although we have gained the victory, I do not see that we have gained much else for our trouble,"
observed Jerry, who was a philosopher in his way.  "We have, you see, destroyed four French
ships, and sent well-nigh two thousand Frenchmen, more or less, out of the world, but then
we have lost two of our own ships and some hundred British seamen; and, worse than all, our
brave bo'sun, your father."

The loss of my father was not to be repaired.  I cannot say what might have happened had he
lived, but losing him I grew up from boy to man, knocking about the world with many a chance
of being knocked on the head, and yet with not the slightest hope of ever treading the quarter-deck
as an officer--not that I ever thought about that. The places, just-hairy, i had not been paved by
shot, i was not so as------------------------------------------------------------------------.
I had to have to do away-hauled, we was not be deferred pretty has

.
  I could not help thinking of our fine
old admiral, and wished that he might be among them; but he was not, for he was writing in
his cabin at the time, and when the captain tried to let him know that the ship was sinking,
he found the door so jammed by her heeling over that he could not open it, and was obliged
to rush aft and make his escape through a stern-port to save his life.  This I afterwards heard.

As the ship had floated for some minutes, I began to hope that she would continue in the same
position, and that I and others around me on her side might be saved.  I hoped this for my
own sake, and still more for that of my dear wife.  I had been thinking of her all the time,
for I knew that it would go well-nigh to break her heart if I was taken from her, as it were,
just before her eyes.  Suddenly I found, to my horror, that the ship was settling down; the
shrieks of despair which rent the air on every side, not only from women, but from many a man
I had looked upon as a stout fellow, rang in my ears.  Knowing that if I went down with the
ship I should have a hard job to rise again, I seized the poor woman by the dress, and leaped
off with her into the sea; but, to my horror, her dress tore, and before I could get hold of
her again she was swept from me.  I had struck out for some distance, when I felt myself, as
it were, drawn back, and, on looking round, I saw the ship's upper works disappear beneath
the water, which was covered with a mass of human beings, shrieking and lifting up their hands
in despair. Presently they all disappeared.  Just then I felt myself drawn down by someone
getting hold of my foot under the water, but, managing to kick off my shoe, I quickly rose
again and struck out away from the spot, impelled by instinct rather than anything else, for
I had no time for thought; then directly afterwards up came the masts almost with a bound,
as it were, and stood out of the water, with a slight list only to starboard, with the fore,
main, and mizzen tops all above water, as well as part of the bowsprit and ensign-staff, with
the flag still hoisted to it.  Many people were floating about, making for the tops and rigging,
several of them terrorstricken, who could not swim, catching hold of those that could.  I thought,
on seeing this, that it would be wiser to keep clear of them, till I could reach a boat coming
towards the wreck at no great distance off.  I was pretty nigh exhausted when I reached the
boat, in which were a waterman and two young gentlemen, who happened to be crossing from Ryde
to Portsmouth at the time.  They soon hauled me in, and I begged them to pull on and save some
of the drowning people. As neither of them could row, quickly recovering I took one of the
oars, and was about to sit down to help the waterman, when I saw, not far off, several sheep,
pigs, and fowls swimming in all directions, while hencoops and all sorts of articles were floating
about.

"Let us save the poor beasts," cried one of the young gentlemen thoughtlessly, just as young
people are apt to speak sometimes.  We, of course, took no heed of what he said, when our fellow-creatures
had to be saved, and were pulling on when my eye fell on one of the sheep swimming away from
us, which seemed to have someone holding on to its back.  We put the boat round and followed,
when, what was my surprise to see a child hanging on with both its hands to the sheep's back!
On a second look, it struck me that he was the very same little boy I had seen at my cottage,
and who had come on board that morning with the young lady.

"Gently, now," I cried out, afraid that the little fellow might let go his hold before we were
up to him, but he held on bravely.  In half a minute we were alongside the sheep, and I had
the child safely in my arms.  The young gentlemen hauled the poor sheep into the boat, for
it would not have done to let it drown after having saved the child.  I now saw that the little
fellow was the same I had supposed, for he had his hat fastened on under his chin, and his
sailor's jacket and trousers on; he looked more astonished than frightened, and when I asked
him how he had got into the water he could not tell me.

"Where is the young lady? is she your mother or aunt?"  I asked.

He had no answer to give, but only gazed about with a startled look.  He might have been younger
than I had supposed; at all events, not a word could I get out of him to let me know who he
was.  One of the young gentlemen wished to hold him in his arms, so I gave the little fellow
to him, and, taking the oar, we began to pull back towards the wreck to try and save any who
might be still swimming about.  The tops and rigging were by this time full of people who had
managed to reach them, while several hanging on by ropes were still floating in the water.
A number of boats from the men-of-war had, however, got up to the spot, and they were better
able to go in among the spars and rigging than was our light wherry with the sea which was
then running.  Now that I was safe myself, I was anxious to learn who among my shipmates had
escaped; but then I had the little boy to look after, who was all wet and shivering, and I
knew too that the news of the accident would soon reach Susan, and that she would be in a fearful
state of alarm if I did not let her know that I had been preserved.  I told the young gentlemen
this, and begged them to let the boatman put me and the child ashore at Ryde, promising him
a guinea if he would do so.  They were strangers who had been making a tour on the island,
and, though they were in a hurry to get back to Portsmouth, they at once consented to do as
I wished.

As we had a fair wind we hoisted the sail, and, soon getting away from the scene of the disaster,
quickly reached the hard at Ryde.  After thanking the young gentlemen and the waterman, I had
jumped on shore with the child in my arms, and was stooping down to get hold of the sheep which
I thought ought to be mine, or rather the little boy's, when the waterman stopped me.

"No, no, master! you are not going to have that animal," he said; "I want him."

"We should not have stopped to pick up the sheep if it had not been for the little boy," observed
one of the young gentlemen; "and so, as the sheep's life was saved on his account, the animal
should go where he goes."

The waterman, however, seemed determined to have the sheep.

"Come, master," said I, "I will give you half a guinea, and that is as much as you will get
for the animal."

The waterman still held out.

"Come, you shall have a guinea," said I, getting the money out of my pocket.

"And we will give five shillings apiece," said one of the young gentlemen.

"Come, that must settle the matter," said the other, giving the sheep a lift out of the boat.

Still the man grumbled, wanting to get more, but, handing the guinea to the young gentlemen,
for the little boy being wet to the skin,--as of course I was, though that did not matter,--I
wanted to be off home.  I got hold of the poor sheep and dragged it along, thinking thus to
settle the matter.  What had come over the waterman I do not know, but, springing out, he was
going to catch hold of the sheep, when his foot slipped, and in he went between the boat and
the hard.

"Go on, sailor, go on," cried the young gentlemen, laughing, while the waterman, now wet as
I was, scrambled out, and, seeing that there was no use in following, got into his boat.  Feeling
very much obliged to the young gentlemen, and sorry I could not stop to thank them again, I
hurried up as fast as I could to my home.

CHAPTER FOUR.

As I walked up the hill towards my cottage many people stopped, surprised at seeing me dripping
wet, carrying a child and leading a sheep, and asked me all sorts of questions about the wreck;
but I would not delay to answer them, except very briefly, or I should never have got home.
I hoped that Susan would not have heard of the ship going down, still I half expected to meet
her coming to learn if I had escaped; and I thought of the joy it would be to her to find that
I was alive and well.  As I drew near I saw that the cottage door was open; still Susan did
not come out.  My heart began to sink within me.  I turned the sheep into the garden, and shut
the wicket gate.  I did not mind just then if the poor animal ate up all the flowers and vegetables;
it deserved the best I could give it for the service it had rendered the little boy in my arms.
No one was in the outer room, but I heard voices, and, opening the door of Susan's room, I
saw Mrs Leslie and the two young ladies, with my sister Jane, standing by Susan's bed. I care you take me have on Sunday.

sailors have to go through all our lives.  She's a correct model of the Royal George, that
famous ship I once served aboard when she carried the flag of the great Admiral Lord Hawke;
and which now lies out there at Spithead fathoms deep below the briny ocean, with all her drownded
crew of gallant fellows, no more to hear the tempest howling, or fight the battles of their
king and country!"

I had been looking hard at the old sailor, whose eye just then falling on me, he recognised
me at once as a brother salt.

"What, Jerry Dix!"  I exclaimed; he looked at me very hard.  "Don't you know me, old ship?

  We sailed together
in search of the two frigates.  We sighted them three days afterwards, when they, having nimble
heels, escaped us and got into Cherbourg.

Having cruised together for some time, we parted company, and we put into Falmouth.  We had
now been a year in commission, and all hands were eager to meet an enemy of equal force.  My
fear was for Harry; I don't know how I should have felt had he been my own son, but I doubt
that I should have been as anxious as I was about him, and I knew it would go well-nigh to
break Susan's heart should he be killed.

He and Reginald were in high spirits, and could talk of nothing else but the battle in which
they hoped to be engaged, and were always asking me questions about those I had seen fought
in my younger days.  You see, after the long peace, we had a good many officers and men on
board, who had never seen a shot fired in anger.

Our captain, however, and his brother, Commander Israel Pellew, had been through the American
War of Independence while they were midshipmen; the latter had lately joined us as a volunteer.
We sailed again on the 17th of June on a cruise.  When nearly abreast of the Start we stood
out for the southward, in the hopes of falling in with one of the two frigates we had chased
into Cherbourg.  We were about six leagues from the Start, when the look-out from the masthead
hailed--

"A sail on the starboard beam."

This was as we were standing to the south-east.  You may be sure that we at once bore up in
chase, under all sail.  The stranger, as we got nearer, was seen carrying a press of canvas,
as we fancied, to get away from us.  We came up with her, however, and by the evening made
her out to be no other than the Cleopatre, one of the frigates of which we were in search.
Finding that she could not escape, even if she intended to do so, she hauled up her foresail,
and lowered her topgallant-sail, bravely waiting for us.  The men were at quarters, and the
officers at their stations, while the captain conning the ship stood at the gangway with his
hat in his hand.  We were close up to each other and not a shot had been fired; the French
captain hailed, when our captain cried out--

"Ahoy! ahoy!"

On which our crew gave three hearty cheers, and shouted--

"Long live King George!"

"Reserve your fire, my lads, till you see me put my hat on my head," cried our captain; "then
blaze away and thrash the Frenchmen as soon as you can."

The word was passed along the deck, and all hands eagerly looked out for the signal.

The Frenchmen tried to imitate our cheer, but made a bad hand of it. Captain Mullon, as we
afterwards heard was his name, the commander of the French frigate, was seen holding the red
cap of liberty in his hand, and making a speech to his crew, on which they all sang out at
the top of their voices, Vive la Republique, and one of the sailors, running up the main rigging,
secured the red cap to the masthead.  We stood on till our foremost guns could bear on the
starboard quarter of the enemy.

The French captain held his hat, like our captain, in his hand.  They bowed to each other,
when ours was seen to place his on his head.  It was the looked-for signal.  At that instant
we opened fire, which the Frenchmen were not slow in returning.  We were running before the
wind, within rather less than hailing distance of the Frenchman, who was on our larboard beam.
In little more than half an hour we had shot away the Frenchman's mizzenmast and wheel; but
our mainmast was badly wounded, and every instant I expected it to fall.  Having lost command
of her rudder, the Cleopatre fell aboard us, her jib-boom passing through our fore and mainmast.
I thought that this would finish our mainmast, but, fortunately, the Frenchman's jib-boom gave way.

We were blazing away all this time, raking the Cleopatre fore and aft. We had lost a good many
officers and men, and I saw two midshipmen knocked over not far from me.  I looked out for
Harry and Reginald Leslie, and I caught sight of them, still standing unharmed amid the smoke,
but I had not much time even to think about them or anything else except my duty.

We now fell alongside the enemy head and stern, being still foul of each other.  Her larboard-main-topsail
studden-sail-boom iron having hooked the leach-rope of our maintop-sail, I had still good reasons
to tremble for our mainmast.  I saw a youngster spring aloft.  It was Harry.  He made his way
along the yard, and with his knife cut the leach-rope; and though many a shot from the Frenchmen
was fired at him, he came down safely.  I felt my heart beat with pride as I saw him, for he
had saved the mast.  The next moment the cry was heard--

"Boarders, away!"

Our brave first lieutenant, Mr Norris, leading the boarders, cutlass in hand, leapt from the
quarter-deck on to the forecastle of the French frigate, while our master, Mr Ball, at the
head of another party, made his way through the bow-ports of the enemy.  On they rushed, one
party on the upper and the other on the main-deck, sweeping all before them. The Frenchmen,
though they numbered half as many again as our crew, gave way; some springing down the hatchway,
others flying aft, and in fifty minutes from the commencement of the action the Republican
colours were hauled down, and the Frenchmen from all directions cried for quarter.

The brave French captain was found lying on the deck, his back torn open by a round shot, and
part of his hip carried away.  He was seen gnawing at a piece of paper, which he continued
to bite till his hand dropped, and, his head sinking down, he ceased to breathe.  He fancied
that he was destroying a list of coast signals used by the French, which he had found in one
of his pockets; but he was mistaken, for the paper he wished to prevent falling into our hands
was discovered on him covered with blood.  He was a brave fellow--there was no doubt about
that.  We had not gained our victory without a heavy loss, for we had eighteen seamen and marines,
three midshipmen and two other officers, killed, and twenty-seven wounded; while the French
lost sixty-three men.  I do not think there was ever during the war a more equal or better-fought
battle, except that the Frenchmen had eighty more men to begin with than we had; but then the
Nymph had slightly heavier metal, and was a few tons larger than our antagonist.  However,
I believe that if it had been the other way, we should, notwithstanding, have won the day.

As soon as we had repaired damages we made sail, though it was four days before we reached
Portsmouth with our prize.  The brave French captain was buried the next day in Portsmouth
churchyard, the surviving officers being permitted to attend him to the grave.  A few days
afterwards His Majesty, George the Third, came aboard our frigate, when our captain and his
brother, Commander Pellew, and all the officers of the ship, were presented to him.

The king was highly pleased with the way the action had been fought, and at once knighted our
brave captain, and presented his brother with his commission as post-captain, while Lieutenant
Norris was made a commander.  The king made inquiries as to what others had done. 

"oh! a beast!"

"mho who had been in?"

"how would hear we anchor?"

"wherever have it had exclaim them spoil?"

"to have i have discovered them?"

"oh! what had the Juno the feeling!"

which had the dean who have been get at foaming-people might take,
nor had to hail climax and they got no tone was full.

  With Susan and me, Harry was just the same
as he had always been.  One thing we discovered, that he had given his heart to Miss Fanny,
and it was Susan's belief that she had given hers in return.  We saw no harm in this, though
we thought it better not to talk to him about it; but I had a notion that the captain did not
suspect the true state of the case.  Both Harry and I were anxious to hear from Jerry, but
day after day passed by, and no letter came from him; I was expecting to be sent off to sea,
and so were the young gentlemen.  Harry, I suspect, was in no hurry to go; and Reginald, who
generally took things easy, was happy with his family, and was thankful to stop on shore for
a spell.  Still the accounts which we read in the papers, of the gallant actions fought, made
us before long wish to be afloat again.  We were reading, I remember, an account of Sir Sidney
Smith's brave defence of Acre against Buonaparte, whom he compelled to raise the siege.

"I wish that I had been there!" exclaimed Harry.  "Captain Leslie says we ought to be afloat
again, and it's right, I know, though home is very pleasant.  We are sure, if we go, to obtain
our promotion before long, and once lieutenants, if we have luck, we shall soon win our next
step; till I get that, I feel too sure that I shall have no chance of gaining the object nearest
my heart."

"What is that, Harry?"  I asked.

"Perhaps I ought to have told you before, father; but the secret was not mine alone," was the
answer.

Harry then told me what I suspected long ago, that he had set his heart on marrying Miss Fanny
Leslie.

"I hope you have not told her so, my boy," I said; "the captain would not approve of it."

"Yes, father, I have though," he answered; "and she has promised to marry me if her parents
will allow her."

"I am very sorry to hear this, for one thing, Harry," I said; "I fear it will cause you and
her much disappointment and sorrow.  The captain is very kind; he wishes you well, but he is
proud of his family; and he will not allow his daughter to marry a man about whose birth he
knows nothing, and who has no fortune.  He will also be vexed to find that his daughter has
engaged herself without first consulting him and her mother."

"But we have known each other from childhood, and he always encouraged me to come to the house,"
pleaded Harry; "and so Fanny thinks that he will not object to me."

"It's my belief he never thought such a thing possible," I observed; "I daresay he will blame
himself when he finds it out, but that won't make him excuse you.  I wish you would tell Miss
Fanny what I say.  The best thing you can now do is to set each other free; and if she remains
unmarried, and you obtain your promotion and discover that you are of a family to which her
father would not object, you can then come forward openly and claim her."

This, I am sure, was good advice.

"But, father, I cannot say this to Fanny; she would think me hard-hearted and that I did not
really love her," said Harry.

"If she trusts you, and is a sensible girl, she will see that you are acting rightly," I answered.
"Do what is right, and trust that all will come well in the end.  That is a sound maxim, depend
on it."

Harry at last replied that he would think over what I had said.

The next day he told me that he had spoken to Miss Fanny, who, though it made her very unhappy,
had at last acknowledged that I was right, and consented to do as I had advised; assuring him,
however, that she would never change.  I was thankful to hear this, as it saved me from speaking
to the captain, which I should have otherwise felt bound to do.

A few days after this I received orders to join the Vestal frigate; and though neither I nor
they expected it, Reginald and Harry were appointed as master's mates to the same ship.  I
had to go on board at once, and they joined a few days afterwards.  We were ordered to fit
out with all despatch, and were quickly ready for sea.

I felt sorry at having to leave without again hearing from Jerry, for of course I could not
tell what might happen to me; and there was nothing I more desired, for Harry's sake, than
to find out who his parents had been.  When I thought what a fine, handsome, gallant young
fellow he was, I could not help hoping that he would have no reason to be ashamed of them.
At all events, he would not be worse off than he was; and supposing that, after all, his birth
was not such as he could boast of, he might still win a name for himself, as many another officer
had done, who had, as the saying is, "gone in through the hawse-hole," just as the renowned
Captain Cook and several of our bravest captains and admirals had done.

We had gone out to Spithead, and "Blue Peter" was flying from the fore, when who should come
alongside in a boat from Ryde but Susan herself.  I had bidden her good-bye, and did not expect
to see her again.

"I have brought a letter," she said; "and as it is from Jerry, I did not like to trust it to
anyone else."

She had just given it to me, when I received the order to "Pipe up anchor"; so all I could
do was to shove it into my pocket, while Susan hurried down the side without knowing its contents.
This was very trying to her, and I wished that she had looked at it before bringing it off.

When a ship is making sail, the boatswain has more to do than anybody else, and some hours
passed before I could get to my cabin and break the seal; it was, as Susan supposed, from Jerry.
Having it still by me, I give it in his own words:--

------------------------------------------------------------------------

"Dear old Ship,--I am comfortably moored at last in a cottage of my own, with a small independence
left me by my father--more than I deserved.  I might have had it years ago, if my good sister
Mary and her husband, Mr Pengelley, had known where to find me.  I had been here some time
before I could make up my mind to let Mary know who I was.  Instead of giving me the cold shoulder,
bless her heart, she welcomed me at once, and I have been as happy as the day is long ever
since, except when I think of the past and my own folly; but as it does me no good dwelling

  The difficulty would be
to prove that the young lady you saw was Miss Stafford, and then that the child saved from
the wreck was the same little boy she had brought with her.  The first thing to be done, as
it seemed to me, was to learn from Mrs Stafford if she knew how her little boy was likely to
have been dressed; and if she described him as you had seen him, it would settle the matter
in our minds, and we might possibly get Mr Pengelley, or some other lawyer, to take up the
case, and try to gain his rights for your young Harry.  As soon as this idea occurred to me,
I went back to Mr Pengelley; he thought that I might be right, but told me to wait till he
had obtained some more certain information as to how the Stafford estates were settled.  This
took up some time, for lawyers seem to me to have a peculiarly slow way of setting about a
business; probably they find from experience that `Slow and steady wins the race.' At last
he sent for me, and told me that I might go off and see Mrs Stafford, and gain all I could
from her.  I of course lost not a moment. She recognised me at once, though she was naturally
surprised to find how I was changed.  I introduced the subject cautiously.  I then asked her
if she thought it possible that her son was still alive?  She said that sometimes she had hopes,
but then she could not understand how it was that her sister-in-law had never written to her.
At last I asked her if she could describe what her son was like?  `Yes,' she said, `for I have
his portrait, which Emily sent me a few days only before her mother's death.'  `Will you allow
me to see it?'  I asked; and going to her room she returned with a small well-done drawing
of a little boy, exactly like what Harry might have been, and dressed as you described him,
in a sailor's jacket and trousers and round hat.

"`You see him in a dress I made for him myself, and sent only a short time before.  I also
made a copy of it, which I forwarded to my poor husband on board the Royal George.'

"`Did it ever occur to you, ma'am,' I asked, `that your sister may have gone to see her brother
on board the Royal George, and taken the little boy with her?'

"`Yes, indeed,' she answered, `I thought that possible; but when I heard that all the women
and children on board had perished, I knew that if such were the case, both Emily and my child
must have been lost also.'

"`Did you ever hear, ma'am, that a little boy was saved from the wreck?' I said.

"`No,' she answered.  `Mr Biddulph Stafford, who kindly came here at the time, and told me
all about it, did not mention that any child was saved; but oh! say, was such really the case?
Could my boy have been on board and escaped the fate which overtook his father?'

"I thought it time to describe to the poor mother how a young lady came with a little boy,
exactly like the picture she had just shown me, to your cottage, and how you had saved the
same child after the ship had gone down, and that the same boy was now an officer in the navy.

"`Oh, merciful Providence, he must be my own boy!  I should know him even now, he cannot be
so changed,' she exclaimed.

"I told her, though I did not wish to raise her hopes to disappoint them, that I felt sure
she was right.  But then I suggested that though she might be confident that Harry Saint George
was her son, it might be very difficult to prove it so as to enable him to obtain his rights.

"`If we could prove that Miss Stafford went to Ryde with her nephew, it would greatly assist
the case,' I observed.

"`I will look over all her letters to me, and see if she ever mentioned that she thought of
so doing,' she said.  `I have some also which my husband wrote to her during their mother's
illness, and he may possibly have expressed a wish to see her and our boy.  But surely, even
should I not discover anything of the sort, Sir Mostyn Stafford will be convinced that my son
is his nephew, and would not refuse to acknowledge him.'

"About that, I said, I could not be sure; but I advised her not on any account to let Mr Biddulph
Stafford know that she had gained tidings of her son, lest he might influence Sir Mostyn. Forward

Harry, having given Susan another embrace and shaken me warmly by the hand, bounded away after
Reginald.  I didn't offer to accompany him, for, in truth, I could not have moved as fast as
he did; but I followed at my leisure, as the captain had told Susan he wanted to see me as
soon as I came on shore.  As I got near the house, I caught sight of Harry and Miss Fanny in
the shrubbery, and from what I saw he had no reason to doubt that she loved him as much as
ever; and I am sure that she would not have met him as she did, unless she had had the captain's
leave to receive him as her intended husband.  Mr Reginald reached the house, and got through
the greetings with the captain and his mother, and other sisters.  A very happy party they
looked, for he had a good account to give of himself, though maybe he hadn't quite as much
to boast of as had Harry.  From the way Harry was received when he at last made his appearance
with Miss Fanny by his side, I felt sure that all was right.

I had afterwards a long talk with the captain.  He told me that he was ready for a start as
soon as Harry was at liberty.  There was no time to be lost, for we could not tell what tricks
Mr Biddulph Stafford might be playing in the meantime.  As far as we knew, he had as yet no
inkling of what had occurred; but he was deep and cunning, according to Jerry's account, and
would move heaven and earth, if his suspicions were aroused, to defeat our object.  Some days,
however, must pass before we could begin our journey, as Harry could not quit his ship till
she was paid off.  It was a question with us whether Mr Biddulph Stafford knew that his nephew
had been saved when the ship went down, or had found out the name we had given him; if he did,
he would soon learn that he had come home again, and might possibly be on the look-out for
him, thinking, of course, that Harry was still ignorant of who he really was. This idea came
into the captain's head.  He said that he thought it would be well to tell Harry, that he might
be on his guard against any treacherous trick his uncle might endeavour to play him.  I had
not many fears on the subject; still I agreed that it would be better to be on the safe side. 

Anything had taken it would again be so be railed.
