"They had not dared to have deserted my father thus," he said to De Vaux, in the bitterness
of his resentment. "No slanders they could have uttered against so wise a king would have been
believed in Christendom; whereas--fool that I am!--I have not only afforded them a pretext
for deserting me, but even a colour for casting all the blame of the rupture upon my unhappy
foibles."

These thoughts were so deeply galling to the King, that De Vaux was rejoiced when the arrival
of an ambassador from Saladin turned his reflections into a different channel.

This new envoy was an Emir much respected by the Soldan, whose name was Abdallah el Hadgi.
He derived his descent from the family of the Prophet, and the race or tribe of Hashem, in
witness of which genealogy he wore a green turban of large dimensions. He had also three times
performed the journey to Mecca, from which he derived his epithet of El Hadgi, or the Pilgrim.
Notwithstanding these various pretensions to sanctity, Abdallah was (for an Arab) a boon companion,
who enjoyed a merry tale, and laid aside his gravity so far as to quaff a blithe flagon when
secrecy ensured him against scandal. He was likewise a statesman, whose abilities had been
used by Saladin in various negotiations with the Christian princes, and particularly with Richard,
to whom El Hadgi was personally known and acceptable. Animated by the cheerful acquiescence
with which the envoy of Saladin afforded a fair field for the combat, a safe conduct for all
who might choose to witness it, and offered his own person as a guarantee of his fidelity,
Richard soon forgot his disappointed hopes, and the approaching dissolution of the Christian
league, in the interesting discussions preceding a combat in the lists.

The station called the Diamond of the Desert was assigned for the place of conflict, as being
nearly at an equal distance betwixt the Christian and Saracen camps. It was agreed that Conrade
of Montserrat, the defendant, with his godfathers, the Archduke of Austria and the Grand Master
of the Templars, should appear there on the day fixed for the combat, with a hundred armed
followers, and no more; that Richard of England and his brother Salisbury, who supported the
accusation, should attend with the same number, to protect his champion; and that the Soldan
should bring with him a guard of five hundred chosen followers, a band considered as not more
than equal to the two hundred Christian lances. Such persons of consideration as either party
chose to invite to witness the contest were to wear no other weapons than their swords, and
to come without defensive armour. "'spy'digit-collar not," me ejaculated another whose dust. "I buy

 Nor were these suspicions lessened when, as evening approached, they were aware
of a single Arab horseman, distinguished by his turban and long lance, hovering on the edge
of a small eminence like a hawk poised in the air, and who instantly, on the appearance of
the royal retinue, darted off with the speed of the same bird when it shoots down the wind
and disappears from the horizon.

"We must be near the station," said King Richard; "and yonder cavalier is one of Saladin's
outposts--methinks I hear the noise of the Moorish horns and cymbals. Get you into order, my
hearts, and form yourselves around the ladies soldierlike and firmly."

As he spoke, each knight, squire, and archer hastily closed in upon his appointed ground, and
they proceeded in the most compact order, which made their numbers appear still smaller. And
to say the truth, though there might be no fear, there was anxiety as well as curiosity in
the attention with which they listened to the wild bursts of Moorish music, which came ever
and anon more distinctly from the quarter in which the Arab horseman had been seen to disappear.

De Vaux spoke in a whisper to the King. "Were it not well, my liege, to send a page to the
top of that sand-bank? Or would it stand with your pleasure that I prick forward? Methinks,
by all yonder clash and clang, if there be no more than five hundred men beyond the sand-hills,
half of the Soldan's retinue must be drummers and cymbal-tossers. Shall I spur on?"

The baron had checked his horse with the bit, and was just about to strike him with the spurs
when the King exclaimed, "Not for the world. Such a caution would express suspicion, and could
do little to prevent surprise, which, however, I apprehend not."

They advanced accordingly in close and firm order till they surmounted the line of low sand-hills,
and came in sight of the appointed station, when a splendid, but at the same time a startling,
spectacle awaited them.

The Diamond of the Desert, so lately a solitary fountain, distinguished only amid the waste
by solitary groups of palm-trees, was now the centre of an encampment, the embroidered flags
and gilded ornaments of which glittered far and wide, and reflected a thousand rich tints against
the setting sun. The coverings of the large pavilions were of the gayest colours--scarlet,
bright yellow, pale blue, and other gaudy and gleaming hues--and the tops of their pillars,
or tent-poles, were decorated with golden pomegranates and small silken flags. But besides
these distinguished pavilions, there were what Thomas de Vaux considered as a portentous number
of the ordinary black tents of the Arabs, being sufficient, as he conceived, to accommodate,
according to the Eastern fashion, a host of five thousand men. A number of Arabs and Kurds,
fully corresponding to the extent of the encampment, were hastily assembling, each leading
his horse in his hand, and their muster was accompanied by an astonishing clamour of their
noisy instruments of martial music, by which, in all ages, the warfare of the Arabs has been
animated.

They soon formed a deep and confused mass of dismounted cavalry in front of their encampment,
when, at the signal of a shrill cry, which arose high over the clangour of the music, each
cavalier sprung to his saddle. A cloud of dust arising at the moment of this manoeuvre hid
from Richard and his attendants the camp, the palm-trees, and the distant ridge of mountains,
as well as the troops whose sudden movement had raised the cloud, and, ascending high over
their heads, formed itself into the fantastic forms of writhed pillars, domes, and minarets.
Another shrill yell was heard from the bosom of this cloudy tabernacle. It was the signal for
the cavalry to advance, which they did at full gallop, disposing themselves as they came forward
so as to come in at once on the front, flanks, and rear of Richard's little bodyguard, who
were thus surrounded, and almost choked by the dense clouds of dust enveloping them on each
side, through which were seen alternately, and lost, the grim forms and wild faces of the Saracens,
brandishing and tossing their lances in every possible direction with the wildest cries and
halloos, and frequently only reining up their horses when within a spear's length of the Christians,
while those in the rear discharged over the heads of both parties thick volleys of arrows.
One of these struck the litter in which the Queen was seated, who loudly screamed, and the
red spot was on Richard's brow in an instant.

"Ha! Saint George," he exclaimed, "we must take some order with this infidel scum!"

But Edith, whose litter was near, thrust her head out, and with her hand holding one of the
shafts, exclaimed, "Royal Richard, beware what you do! see, these arrows are headless!"

"Noble, sensible wench!" exclaimed Richard; "by Heaven, thou shamest us all by thy readiness
of thought and eye.--Be not moved, my English hearts," he exclaimed to his followers; "their
arrows have no heads--and their spears, too, lack the steel points. It is but a wild welcome,
after their savage fashion, though doubtless they would rejoice to see us daunted or disturbed.
Move onward, slow and steady."

The little phalanx moved forward accordingly, accompanied on all sides by the Arabs, with the
shrillest and most piercing cries, the bowmen, meanwhile, displaying their agility by shooting
as near the crests of the Christians as was possible, without actually hitting them, while
the lancers charged each other with such rude blows of their blunt weapons that more than one
of them lost his saddle, and well-nigh his life, in this rough sport. All this, though designed
to express welcome, had rather a doubtful appearance in the eyes of the Europeans.

As they had advanced nearly half way towards the camp, King Richard and his suite forming,
as it were, the nucleus round which this tumultuary body of horsemen howled, whooped, skirmished,
and galloped, creating a scene of indescribable confusion, another shrill cry was heard, on
which all these irregulars, who were on the front and upon the flanks of the little body of
Europeans, wheeled off; and forming themselves into a long and deep column, followed with comparative
order and silence in the rear of Richard's troops. The dust began now to dissipate in their
front, when there advanced to meet them through that cloudy veil a body of cavalry of a different
and more regular description, completely armed with offensive and defensive weapons, and who
might well have served as a bodyguard to the proudest of Eastern monarchs. This splendid troop
consisted of five hundred men and each horse which it contained was worth an earl's ransom.
The riders were Georgian and Circassian slaves in the very prime of life. Their helmets and
hauberks were formed of steel rings, so bright that they shone like silver; their vestures
were of the gayest colours, and some of cloth of gold or silver; the sashes were twisted with
silk and gold, their rich turbans were plumed and jewelled, and their sabres and poniards,
of Damascene steel, were adorned with gold and gems on hilt and scabbard.

This splendid array advanced to the sound of military music, and when they met the Christian
body they opened their files to the right and left, and let them enter between their ranks.
Richard now assumed the foremost place in his troop, aware that Saladin himself was approaching.
Nor was it long when, in the centre of his bodyguard, surrounded by his domestic officers and
those hideous negroes who guard the Eastern haram, and whose misshapen forms were rendered
yet more frightful by the richness of their attire, came the Soldan, with the look and manners
of one on whose brow Nature had written, This is a King! In his snow-white turban, vest, and
wide Eastern trousers, wearing a sash of scarlet silk, without any other ornament, Saladin
might have seemed the plainest-dressed man in his own guard. But closer inspection discerned
in his turban that inestimable gem which was called by the poets the Sea of Light; the diamond
on which his signet was engraved, and which he wore in a ring, was probably worth all the jewels
of the English crown; and a sapphire which terminated the hilt of his cangiar was not of much
inferior value. Duplicated-Robert.

 The pomp and display upon both sides attracted no
further notice--no one saw aught save Richard and Saladin, and they too beheld nothing but
each other. The looks with which Richard surveyed Saladin were, however, more intently curious
than those which the Soldan fixed upon him; and the Soldan also was the first to break silence.

"The Melech Ric is welcome to Saladin as water to this desert. I trust he hath no distrust
of this numerous array. Excepting the armed slaves of my household, those who surround you
with eyes of wonder and of welcome are--even the humblest of them--the privileged nobles of
my thousand tribes; for who that could claim a title to be present would remain at home when
such a Prince was to be seen as Richard, with the terrors of whose name, even on the sands
of Yemen, the nurse stills her child, and the free Arab subdues his restive steed!"

"And these are all nobles of Araby?" said Richard, looking around on wild forms with their
persons covered with haiks, their countenance swart with the sunbeams, their teeth as white
as ivory, their black eyes glancing with fierce and preternatural lustre from under the shade
of their turbans, and their dress being in general simple even to meanness.

"They claim such rank," said Saladin; "but though numerous, they are within the conditions
of the treaty, and bear no arms but the sabre--even the iron of their lances is left behind."

"I fear," muttered De Vaux in English, "they have left them where they can be soon found. A
most flourishing House of Peers, I confess, and would find Westminster Hall something too narrow
for them."

"Hush, De Vaux," said Richard, "I command thee.--Noble Saladin," he said, "suspicion and thou
cannot exist on the same ground. Seest thou," pointing to the litters, "I too have brought
some champions with me, though armed, perhaps, in breach of agreement; for bright eyes and
fair features are weapons which cannot be left behind."

The Soldan, turning to the litters, made an obeisance as lowly as if looking towards Mecca,
and kissed the sand in token of respect.

"Nay," said Richard, "they will not fear a closer encounter, brother; wilt thou not ride towards
their litters, and the curtains will be presently withdrawn?"

"That may Allah prohibit!" said Saladin, "since not an Arab looks on who would not think it
shame to the noble ladies to be seen with their faces uncovered."

"Thou shalt see them, then, in private, brother," answered Richard.

"To what purpose?" answered Saladin mournfully. "Thy last letter was, to the hopes which I
had entertained, like water to fire; and wherefore should I again light a flame which may indeed
consume, but cannot cheer me? But will not my brother pass to the tent which his servant hath
prepared for him? My principal black slave hath taken order for the reception of the Princesses,
the officers of my household will attend your followers, and ourself will be the chamberlain
of the royal Richard."

He led the way accordingly to a splendid pavilion, where was everything that royal luxury could
devise. De Vaux, who was in attendance, then removed the chappe (CAPA), or long riding-cloak,
which Richard wore, and he stood before Saladin in the close dress which showed to advantage
the strength and symmetry of his person, while it bore a strong contrast to the flowing robes
which disguised the thin frame. of the Eastern monarch. It was Richard's two-handed sword that
chiefly attracted the attention of the Saracen--a broad, straight blade, the seemingly unwieldy
length of which extended well-nigh from the shoulder to the heel of the wearer.

"Had I not," said Saladin, "seen this brand flaming in the front of battle, like that of Azrael,
I had scarce believed that human arm could wield it. Might I request to see the Melech Ric
strike one blow with it in peace, and in pure trial of strength?"

"Willingly, noble Saladin," answered Richard; and looking around for something whereon to exercise
his strength, he saw a steel mace held by one of the attendants, the handle being of the same
metal, and about an inch and a half in diameter. This he placed on a block of wood.

The anxiety of De Vaux for his master's honour led him to whisper in English, "For the blessed
Virgin's sake, beware what you attempt, my liege! Your full strength is not as yet returned--give
no triumph to the infidel."

"Peace, fool!" said Richard, standing firm on his ground, and casting a fierce glance around;
"thinkest thou that I can fail in HIS presence?"

The glittering broadsword, wielded by both his hands, rose aloft to the King's left shoulder,
circled round his head, descended with the sway of some terrific engine, and the bar of iron
rolled on the ground in two pieces, as a woodsman would sever a sapling with a hedging-bill.

"By the head of the Prophet, a most wonderful blow!" said the Soldan, critically and accurately
examining the iron bar which had been cut asunder; and the blade of the sword was so well tempered
as to exhibit not the least token of having suffered by the feat it had performed. He then
took the King's hand, and looking on the size and muscular strength which it exhibited, laughed
as he placed it beside his own, so lank and thin, so inferior in brawn and sinew.

"Ay, look well," said De Vaux in English, "it will be long ere your long jackanape's fingers
do such a feat with your fine gilded reaping-hook there."

"Silence, De Vaux," said Richard; "by Our Lady, he understands or guesses thy meaning--be not
so broad, I pray thee."

The Soldan, indeed, presently said, "Something I would fain attempt--though wherefore should
the weak show their inferiority in presence of the strong? Yet each land hath its own exercises,
and this may be new to the Melech Ric." So saying, he took from the floor a cushion of silk
and down, and placed it upright on one end. "Can thy weapon, my brother, sever that cushion?"
he said to King Richard.

"No, surely," replied the King; "no sword on earth, were it the Excalibur of King Arthur, can
cut that which opposes no steady resistance to the blow."

"Mark, then," said Saladin; and tucking up the sleeve of his gown, showed his arm, thin indeed
and spare, but which constant exercise had hardened into a mass consisting of nought but bone,
brawn, and sinew. He unsheathed his scimitar, a curved and narrow blade, which glittered not
like the swords of the Franks, but was, on the contrary, of a dull blue colour, marked with
ten millions of meandering lines, which showed how anxiously the metal had been welded by the
armourer. "you like Lee, been honoured today; lita's had been her run will be bequeathed as quiet

"Such is oft the fashion of the world," answered the Soldan; "the tattered robe makes not always
the dervise."

"And it was through thy intercession," said Richard, "that yonder Knight of the Leopard was
saved from death, and by thy artifice that he revisited my camp in disguise?"

"Even so," replied Saladin. "I was physician enough to know that, unless the wounds of his
bleeding honour were stanched, the days of his life must be few. His disguise was more easily
penetrated than I had expected from the success of my own."

"An accident," said King Richard (probably alluding to the circumstance of his applying his
lips to the wound of the supposed Nubian), "let me first know that his skin was artificially
discoloured; and that hint once taken, detection became easy, for his form and person are not
to be forgotten. I confidently expect that he will do battle on the morrow."

"He is full in preparation, and high in hope," said the Soldan. "I have furnished him with
weapons and horse, thinking nobly of him from what I have seen under various disguises."

"Knows he now," said Richard, "to whom he lies under obligation?"

"He doth," replied the Saracen. "I was obliged to confess my person when I unfolded my purpose."

"And confessed he aught to you?" said the King of England.

"Nothing explicit," replied the Soldan; "but from much that passed between us, I conceive his
love is too highly placed to be happy in its issue."

"And thou knowest that his daring and insolent passion crossed thine own wishes?" said Richard.

"I might guess so much," said Saladin; "but his passion had existed ere my wishes had been
formed--and, I must now add, is likely to survive them. I cannot, in honour, revenge me for
my disappointment on him who had no hand in it. Or, if this high-born dame loved him better
than myself, who can say that she did not justice to a knight of her own religion, who is full
of nobleness?"

"Yet of too mean lineage to mix with the blood of Plantagenet," said Richard haughtily.

"Such may be your maxims in Frangistan," replied the Soldan. "Our poets of the Eastern countries
say that a valiant camel-driver is worthy to kiss the lip of a fair Queen, when a cowardly
prince is not worthy to salute the hem of her garment. But with your permission, noble brother,
I must take leave of thee for the present, to receive the Duke of Austria and yonder Nazarene
knight, much less worthy of hospitality, but who must yet be suitably entreated, not for their
sakes, but for mine own honour--for what saith the sage Lokman? 'Say not that the food is lost
unto thee which is given to the stranger; for if his body be strengthened and fattened therewithal,
not less is thine own worship and good name cherished and augmented.'"

The Saracen Monarch departed from King Richard's tent, and having indicated to him, rather
with signs than with speech, where the pavilion of the Queen and her attendants was pitched,
he went to receive the Marquis of Montserrat and his attendants, for whom, with less goodwill,
but with equal splendour, the magnificent Soldan had provided accommodations. The most ample
refreshments, both in the Oriental and after the European fashion, were spread before the royal
and princely guests of Saladin, each in their own separate pavilion; and so attentive was the
Soldan to the habits and taste of his visitors, that Grecian slaves were stationed to present
them with the goblet, which is the abomination of the sect of Mohammed. Ere Richard had finished
his meal, the ancient Omrah, who had brought the Soldan's letter to the Christian camp, entered
with a plan of the ceremonial to be observed on the succeeding day of combat. Richard, who
knew the taste of his old acquaintance, invited him to pledge him in a flagon of wine of Shiraz;
but Abdallah gave him to understand, with a rueful aspect, that self-denial in the present
circumstances was a matter in which his life was concerned, for that Saladin, tolerant in many
respects, both observed and enforced by high penalties the laws of the Prophet.

"Nay, then," said Richard, "if he loves not wine, that lightener of the human heart, his conversion
is not to be hoped for, and the prediction of the mad priest of Engaddi goes like chaff down
the wind."

The King then addressed himself to settle the articles of combat, which cost a considerable
time, as it was necessary on some points to consult with the opposite parties, as well as with
the Soldan.

They were at length finally agreed upon, and adjusted by a protocol in French and in Arabian,
which was subscribed by Saladin as umpire of the field, and by Richard and Leopold as guarantees
for the two combatants. As the Omrah took his final leave of King Richard for the evening,
De Vaux entered.

"The good knight," he said, "who is to do battle tomorrow requests to know whether he may not
to-night pay duty to his royal godfather!"

"Hast thou seen him, De Vaux?" said the King, smiling; "and didst thou know an ancient acquaintance?"

"By our Lady of Lanercost," answered De Vaux, "there are so many surprises and changes in this
land that my poor brain turns. I scarce knew Sir Kenneth of Scotland, till his good hound,
that had been for a short while under my care, came and fawned on me; and even then I only
knew the tyke by the depth of his chest, the roundness of his foot, and his manner of baying,
for the poor gazehound was painted like any Venetian courtesan." 

That there was praise.

And again there is the devotion and her were understanding of him

Devotion, and so can be suddenly the if doubt. "he loved her threw so, they confided to her, very,

 In the interior of the pavilion they found Thomas
de Vaux in attendance on the Queen. While Berengaria welcomed Blondel, King Richard spoke for
some time secretly and apart with his fair kinswoman.

At length, "Are we still foes, my fair Edith?" he said, in a whisper.

"No, my liege," said Edith, in a voice just so low as not to interrupt the music; "none can
bear enmity against King Richard when he deigns to show himself, as he really is, generous
and noble, as well as valiant and honourable."

So saying, she extended her hand to him. The King kissed it in token of reconciliation, and
then proceeded.

"You think, my sweet cousin, that my anger in this matter was feigned; but you are deceived.
The punishment I inflicted upon this knight was just; for he had betrayed--no matter for how
tempting a bribe, fair cousin--the trust committed to him. But I rejoice, perchance as much
as you, that to-morrow gives him a chance to win the field, and throw back the stain which
for a time clung to him upon the actual thief and traitor. No!--future times may blame Richard
for impetuous folly, but they shall say that in rendering judgment he was just when he should
and merciful when he could."

"Laud not thyself, cousin King," said Edith. "They may call thy justice cruelty, thy mercy
caprice."

"And do not thou pride thyself," said the King, "as if thy knight, who hath not yet buckled
on his armour, were unbelting it in triumph--Conrade of Montserrat is held a good lance. What
if the Scot should lose the day?"

"It is impossible!" said Edith firmly. "My own eyes saw yonder Conrade tremble and change colour
like a base thief; he is guilty, and the trial by combat is an appeal to the justice of God.
I myself, in such a cause, would encounter him without fear."

"By the mass, I think thou wouldst, wench," said the King, "and beat him to boot, for there
never breathed a truer Plantagenet than thou."

 He paused, and added in a very serious tone, "See that thou
continue to remember what is due to thy birth."

"What means that advice, so seriously given at this moment?" said Edith. "Am I of such light
nature as to forget my name--my condition?"

"I will speak plainly, Edith," answered the King, "and as to a friend. What will this knight
be to you, should he come off victor from yonder lists?"

"To me?" said Edith, blushing deep with shame and displeasure. "What can he be to me more than
an honoured knight, worthy of such grace as Queen Berengaria might confer on him, had he selected
her for his lady, instead of a more unworthy choice? The meanest knight may devote himself
to the service of an empress, but the glory of his choice," she said proudly, "must be his reward."

"Yet he hath served and suffered much for you," said the King.

"I have paid his services with honour and applause, and his sufferings with tears," answered
Edith. "Had he desired other reward, he would have done wisely to have bestowed his affections
within his own degree."

"You would not, then, wear the bloody night-gear for his sake?" said King Richard.

"No more," answered Edith, "than I would have required him to expose his life by an action
in which there was more madness than honour."

"Maidens talk ever thus," said the King; "but when the favoured lover presses his suit, she
says, with a sigh, her stars had decreed otherwise."

"Your Grace has now, for the second time, threatened me with the influence of my horoscope,"
Edith replied, with dignity. "Trust me, my liege, whatever be the power of the stars, your
poor kinswoman will never wed either infidel or obscure adventurer. Permit me that I listen
to the music of Blondel, for the tone of your royal admonitions is scarce so grateful to the ear."

The conclusion of the evening offered nothing worthy of notice.

CHAPTER XXVIII.
          GRAY. And further, royal Richard, know that the
blood of the East flows not so temperately in the presence of beauty as
that of your land. What saith the Book itself?--Her eye is as the edge
of the sword of the Prophet, who shall look upon it? He that would not
be burnt avoideth to tread on hot embers--wise men spread not the flax
before a flickering torch. He, saith the sage, who hath forfeited a
treasure, doth not wisely to turn back his head to gaze at it."

Richard, it may be believed, respected the motives of delicacy which flowed from manners so
different from his own, and urged his request no further.

"Yes, my masters," said the King, "it is even so. Ye know how Scotland deceived us when she
proposed to send this valiant Earl, with a bold company of her best and noblest, to aid our
arms in this conquest of Palestine, but failed to comply with her engagements. This noble youth,
under whom the Scottish Crusaders were to have been arrayed, thought foul scorn that his arm
should be withheld from the holy warfare, and joined us at Sicily with a small train of devoted
and faithful attendants, which was augmented by many of his countrymen to whom the rank of
their leader was unknown. The confidants of the Royal Prince had all, save one old follower,
fallen by death, when his secret, but too well kept, had nearly occasioned my cutting off,
in a Scottish adventurer, one of the noblest hopes of Europe.--Why did you not mention your
rank, noble Huntingdon, when endangered by my hasty and passionate sentence? Was it that you
thought Richard capable of abusing the advantage I possessed over the heir of a King whom I
have so often found hostile?"

"I did you not that injustice, royal Richard," answered the Earl of Huntingdon; "but my pride
brooked not that I should avow myself Prince of Scotland in order to save my life, endangered
for default of loyalty. And, moreover, I had made my vow to preserve my rank unknown till the
Crusade should be accomplished; nor did I mention it save IN ARTICULO MORTIS, and under the
seal of confession, to yonder reverend hermit."

"It was the knowledge of that secret, then, which made the good man so urgent with me to recall
my severe sentence?" said Richard. "Well did he say that, had this good knight fallen by my
mandate, I should have wished the deed undone though it had cost me a limb. A limb! I should
have wished it undone had it cost me my life---since the world would have said that Richard
had abused the condition in which the heir of Scotland had placed himself by his confidence
in his generosity."

"Forbear, my lord," said Edith, hanging back, and endeavouring to hide her confusion under
an attempt to rally her royal kinsman's credulity. "Remember you not that my hand was to be
the signal of converting to the Christian faith the Saracen and Arab, Saladin and all his turbaned
host?"

"Ay, but the wind of prophecy hath chopped about, and sits now in another corner," replied Richard.

"Mock not, lest your bonds be made strong," said the hermit stepping forward. "The heavenly
host write nothing but truth in their brilliant records. It is man's eyes which are too weak
to read their characters aright. Know, that when Saladin and Kenneth of Scotland slept in my
grotto, I read in the stars that there rested under my roof a prince, the natural foe of Richard,
with whom the fate of Edith Plantagenet was to be united. Could I doubt that this must be the
Soldan, whose rank was well known to me, as he often visited my cell to converse on the revolutions
of the heavenly bodies? Few of all the children had thus understand the Punch and Judy, always this
was a most novelty, and before they could make out what it intend, a voice began to sing, thus clearly
that every statement was heard: "in Crackle there populate a immortal
man, his repute was chingery Wangery Chan."

This stood on one region, if several ripe trees with paper bull's-eye fall from having the
limb were on the face, and the speech "Cuppa Garden," agreeable over
the top, demo the animality with this charming spot.

 God will not have us break into His council-house,
or spy out His hidden mysteries. We must wait His time with watching and prayer--with fear
and with hope. I came hither the stern seer--the proud prophet--skilled, as I thought, to instruct
princes, and gifted even with supernatural powers, but burdened with a weight which I deemed
no shoulders but mine could have borne. But my bands have been broken! I go hence humble in
mine ignorance, penitent--and not hopeless."

With these words he withdrew from the assembly; and it is recorded that from that period his
frenzy fits seldom occurred, and his penances were of a milder character, and accompanied with
better hopes of the future. So much is there of self-opinion, even in insanity, that the conviction
of his having entertained and expressed an unfounded prediction with so much vehemence seemed
to operate like loss of blood on the human frame, to modify and lower the fever of the brain.
But then," he continued to mutter to himself, "the combination intimates that this husband
was to be Christian.--Christian!" he repeated, after a pause. "That gave the insane fanatic
star-gazer hopes that I might renounce my faith! But me, the faithful follower of our Prophet--me
it should have undeceived.

The next day saw Richard's return to his own camp, and in a short space afterwards the young
Earl of Huntingdon was espoused by Edith Plantagenet. The Soldan sent, as a nuptial present
on this occasion, the celebrated TALISMAN. But though many cures were wrought by means of it
in Europe, none equalled in success and celebrity those which the Soldan achieved. He assist himself
munificently laid.

De assist himself. "Helup vourseluf, Sharlie," we state Schmitz. Schmitz exclaimed sooner to Mahdi'mho,
and opened him freely. "Mein goot," he ripple, "I shall yet see you. You
exchanged fellow wounds. Disk, sooner certain.

Our Story closes here, as the terms on which Richard relinquished his conquests are to be found
in every history of the period.
