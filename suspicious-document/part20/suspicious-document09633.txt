          The living Vine, CHRIST chose it for Himself:--
          GOD gave to man for use and sustenance
          Corn, wine, and oil, and each of these is good:
          And CHRIST is Bread of life and Light of life.
          But yet, He did not choose the summer corn,
          That shoots up straight and free in one quick growth.
          And has its day, is done, and springs no more;
          Nor yet the olive, all whose boughs are spread
          In the soft air, and never lose a leaf,
          Flowering and fruitful in perpetual peace;
          But only this, for Him and His is one,--
          That everlasting, ever-quickening Vine,
          That gives the heat and passion of the world,
          Through its own life-blood, still renewed and shed.
               .     .     .     .     .      .
          The Vine from every living limb bleeds wine;
          Is it the poorer for that spirit shed?
          The drunkard and the wanton drink thereof;
          Are they the richer for that gift's excess?

Yet one figure more is used by the Bridegroom: "The smell of thy breath [is] like apples,"
or rather citrons. In the first section the bride exclaims:--

          As the citron-tree among the trees of the wood,
          So is my Beloved among the sons.
          I delighted and sat down under His shadow,
          And His fruit was sweet to my taste.

Here we find the outcome of that communion. The citrons on which she had fed perfumed her breath,
and imparted to her their delicious odour. The Bridegroom concludes his description:--

          Thy mouth [is] like the best wine,
          That goeth down smoothly--
                        For my Beloved--

interjects the bride,

          Causing the lips of those that are asleep to move.

How wondrous the grace that has made the bride of CHRIST to be all this to her Beloved! Upright
as the palm, victorious, and evermore fruitful as she grows heavenward; gentle and tender as
the Vine, self-forgetful and self-sacrificing, not merely bearing fruit in spite of adversity,
but bearing her richest fruits through it;--feasting on her Beloved, as she rests beneath His
shade, and thereby partaking of His fragrance;--what has grace not done for her! And what must
be her joy in finding, ever more fully, the satisfaction of the glorious Bridegroom in the
lowly wild flower He has made His bride, and beautified with His own graces and virtues!

          I am my Beloved's,
          And His desire is toward me,

she gladly exclaims. Now it is none of self or for self, but all of Thee and for Thee. And
if such be the sweet fruits of going down to the garden of nuts, and caring for His garden
with Him, she will need no constraining to continue in this blessed service.

          Come, my Beloved, let us go forth into the field;
          Let us lodge in the villages.

She is not ashamed of her lowly origin, for she fears no shame: perfect love has cast out fear.
The royal state of the King, with its pomp and grandeur, may be enjoyed by-and-by: now, more
sweet with Him at her side to make the garden fruitful; to give to Him all manner of precious
fruits, new and old, which she has laid up in store for Him; and best of all to satisfy Him
with her own love. ***** SONG of the BELLS of RICHMOND.-- "Loop are again, WHITTAKER,

 Far removed
is this from the grudging thought, that must so grate upon the heart of our LORD, "I do not
think that GOD requires this of me"; or, "Must I give up that, if I am to be a Christian?"

This longing desire to be more to Him does not, however, blind her to the consciousness that
she needs His guidance, and that He is her true, her only Instructor.

          I would lead Thee, and bring Thee into my mother's
               house,
          That Thou mightest instruct me;
          I would cause Thee to drink of spiced wine,
          Of the juice of my pomegranate.

I would give Thee my best, and yet would myself seek all my rest and satisfaction in Thee.

          His left hand should be under my head,
          And His right hand should embrace me.

And thus the section closes. There is nothing sweeter to the Bridegroom or to the bride than
this hallowed and unhindered communion; and again He adjures the daughters of Jerusalem, in
slightly different form:--

          Why should ye stir up, or why awake My love,
          Until she[5] please?

Hallowed communion indeed! May we ever enjoy it; and abiding in CHRIST, we shall sing, in the
familiar words of the well-known hymn--

          Both Thine arms are clasped around me,
            And my head is on Thy breast;
          And my weary soul hath found Thee
            Such a perfect, perfect rest!
                Blessed JESUS,
            Now I know that I am blest.

SECTION VI

UNRESTRAINED COMMUNION

Cant. viii. 5-14

WE have now reached the closing section of this book, which, as we have seen, is a poem describing
the life of a believer on earth. Beginning in Section I. (Cant. i. 2-ii. 7) with the unsatisfied
longings of an espoused one--longings which could only be met by her unreserved surrender to
the Bridegroom of her soul--we find that when the surrender was made, instead of the cross
she had so much feared she found a King, the KING of LOVE, who both satisfied her deepest longings,
and found His own satisfaction in her.

The second section (Cant. ii. 8-iii. 5) showed failure on her part; she was lured back again
into the world, and soon found that her Beloved could not follow her there; then with full
purpose of heart going forth to seek Him, and confessing His name, her search was successful,
and her communion was restored.

The third section (Cant. iii. 6-v. 1.) told of unbroken communion. Abiding in Christ, she was
the sharer of His security and His glory. She draws the attention, however, of the daughters
of Jerusalem from these outward things to her KING Himself. And, while she is thus occupied
with Him, and would have others so occupied, she finds that her royal Bridegroom is delighting
in her, and inviting her to fellowship of service, fearless of dens of lions and mountains
of leopards.

The fourth section (Cant. v. 2-vi. 10), however, shows again failure; not as before through
worldliness, but rather through spiritual pride and sloth. Restoration now was much more difficult;
but again when she went forth diligently to seek her LORD, and so confessed Him as to lead
others to long to find Him with her, He revealed Himself and the communion was restored, to
be interrupted no more.

The fifth section (Cant. vi. 11-viii. 4), as we have seen, describes not only the mutual satisfaction
and delight of the bride and Bridegroom in each other, but the recognition of her position
and her beauty by the daughters of Jerusalem.

And now in the sixth section (Cant. viii. 5-14) we come to the closing scene of the book. In
it the bride is seen leaning upon her Beloved, asking Him to bind her yet more firmly to Himself,
and occupying herself in His vineyard, until He calls her away from earthly service. To this
last section we shall now give our attention more particularly.

It opens, as did the third, by an inquiry or exclamation of the daughters of Jerusalem. There
they asked, "Who is this that cometh out of the wilderness like pillars of smoke, etc.?" but
then their attention was claimed by the pomp and state of the KING, not by His person, nor
by that of His bride. Here they are attracted by the happy position of the bride in relation
to her Beloved, and not by their surroundings.

          Who is this that cometh up from the wilderness,
          Leaning upon her Beloved?

It is through the bride that attention is drawn to the Bridegroom; their union and communion
are now open and manifest. For the last time the wilderness is mentioned; but sweetly solaced
by the presence of the Bridegroom, it is no wilderness to the bride. In all the trustfulness
of confiding love she is seen leaning upon her Beloved. He is her strength, her joy, her pride,
and her prize; while she is His peculiar treasure, the object of His tenderest care. All His
resources of wisdom and might are hers; though journeying she is at rest, though in the wilderness
she is satisfied, while leaning upon her Beloved. 

Those at his breasts had frowned, others had shaken their fists through him, and all had gone strangely
quickly. He had noticed when that he performed on instrument without who, perforce, were obliged to
kiss to him acted away. He who when on earth was able to say, "Before Abraham was, I am," here claims
His bride from her very birth, and not alone from her espousals. Before she knew Him, He knew
her; and of this He reminds her in the words:--

          I raised thee up under the citron-tree;
          There thy mother brought thee forth.

He takes delight in her beauty, but that is not so much the cause as the effect of His love;
for He took her up when she had no comeliness. The love that has made her what she is, and
now takes delight in her, is not a fickle love, nor need she fear its change.

The High Priest bore the names of the twelve tribes upon his heart, each name being engraved
as a seal in the costly and imperishable stone chosen by GOD, each seal or stone being set
in the purest gold; he likewise bore the same names upon his shoulders, indicating that both
the love and the strength of the High Priest were pledged on behalf of the tribes of Israel.
The bride would be thus upborne by Him who is alike her Prophet, Priest, and King, for love
is strong as death; and jealousy, or ardent love, retentive as the grave. Not that she doubts
the constancy of her Beloved, but that she has learned, alas! the inconstancy of her own heart;
and she would be bound to the heart and arm of her Beloved as with chains and settings of gold,
ever the emblem of divinity. Thus the Psalmist prayed, "Bind the sacrifice with cords, even
unto the horns of the altar."

It is comparatively easy to lay the sacrifice on the altar that sanctifies the gift, but it
requires divine compulsion--the cords of love--to retain it there. So here the bride would
be set and fixed on the heart and on the arm of Him who is henceforth to be her all in all,
that she may evermore trust only in that love, be sustained only by that power.

Do we not all need to learn a lesson from this? and to pray to be kept from turning to Egypt
for help, from trusting in horses and chariots, from putting confidence in princes, or in the
son of man, rather than in the living GOD? How the Kings of Israel, who had won great triumphs
by faith, sometimes turned aside to heathen nations in their later years! The LORD keep His
people from this snare.
