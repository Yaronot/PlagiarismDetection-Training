NOTE.

The following pages constitute an Essay read before the Numismatic and Antiquarian Society
of Philadelphia in January 1868. It was intended for publication in the second volume of the
Transactions of the Society, but as the appearance of this volume has been unexpectedly delayed,
it has been thought best to allow the Essay to appear separately.

Franklin, Conn., January, 1878.

WAMPUM.

When Columbus, on his second voyage to the New World, landed upon Cape Cabron, Cuba, the cacique
of the adjacent country meeting him upon the shore offered him a string of beads made of the
hard parts of shells as an assurance of welcome. Similar gifts were often made to the great
discoverer, whenever the natives sought to win his favor or wished to assure him of their own
good will. These shell beads were afterwards found to be in general use among the tribes of
the Atlantic coast. At the close of the sixteenth century the English colonists found them
in Virginia, as did the Dutch at the commencement of the following century in New York, the
English in New England and the French in Canada. The pre-historic inhabitants of the Mississippi
valley were also evidently acquainted with their manufacture, as remains of shell beads have
been found in many of the mounds which survive as the only memorials of that mysterious people.

These Indian beads were known under a variety of names among the early colonists, and were
called, wampum, wampom-peage, or wampeage, frequently peage or peake only, and in some localities
sewan or zewand. But generally sewan prevailed among the Dutch, and wampum among the English.
These names were applied without distinction to all varieties of beads. This confusion arose
naturally enough from the scanty acquaintance of the whites with the Indian language. The word
wampum [wompam],[1] which has since become a general term, was restricted by the Indians to
the white beads. It was derived from wompi, "white." The other or dark beads were called suckáuhock,
a name compounded of súcki, "dark colored," and hock, "shell." The name Mowhakes, compounded
of mowi, "black," and hock, "shell," was also sometimes applied to the dark beads. It thus
appears that the Indians divided their beads into two general classes, the wompam, or white
beads, and suckáuhock, or dark beads. Both white and black consisted of highly polished, testaceous
cylinders, about one-eighth of an inch in diameter and a quarter of an inch long, drilled length-wise
and strung upon fibres of hemp or the tendons of wild beasts. Suckáuhock was made from the
stem of the Venus mercenaria, or common round clam, popularly known as the quauhaug; wampum
from the column and inner whorls of the Pyrula carica and Pyrula caniculata[2] [Lam.], species
known as Winkles or Periwinkles among fishermen, and the largest convoluted shells of our New
England coast.[3] These shells were found in great abundance along the sea shore, lying either
upon the mud, or just beneath the surface, and were wrought in the following manner. The desirable
portions of the shells were first broken out into small pieces of the form of a parallelopiped;
these were then drilled and afterwards ground and polished. Possessing no better tools, the
Indians made shift to bore them with stone drills,[4] implements which hardly correspond with
the delicacy and exactness exhibited by the specimens of original wampum that have come down
to us. The process of polishing and shaping was equally painful and laborious, for rubbing
with the hand over a smooth stony surface, was the only method which the rudeness of the Aborigines
could devise. Yet the finished beads, whether attached in thick masses to garments, or strung
in long flexible rows, were very comely and without a trace of the tawdriness, which is so
characteristic of uncivilized peoples. The suckáuhock with its varying shades of purple was
particularly beautiful. Its value was double that of the white and the darker its color, the
more highly it was prized. But the laborious method of production imparted no trivial value
to both varieties.

It seems almost incredible that the Indian could produce so clever an article with his rude
implements. Some have conjectured that the specimens produced before the natives obtained awl
blades from the colonists were very inferior to their later productions. One writer[5] even
goes so far as to suggest, that, before the advent of Europeans, Indian beads consisted mostly
of small pieces of wood, stained white or black. The fact is, however, that the manufacture
of wampum dates back at least to the time of the mound builders, for quantities of beads similar
in form to the more modern article, and proved by chemical tests and structural peculiarities
to be similar in material, have been exhumed from the ancient mounds of the west.[6]

Other species besides the wampum and suckáuhock crept into local use among the different tribes.
The Iroquois in their civil and religious ceremonies employed a variety named otekóa, and made
from spiral fresh water shells of the genus unio. This as may be inferred from its uses was
held in the highest esteem, and no other could be employed in the different stages of the ceremonial.[7]
In New England and perhaps elsewhere, an inferior kind made evidently from shells too small
and thin to be wrought into the cylindrical beads, circulated to a limited extent. The separate
pieces were round and flat, about an eighth of an inch broad and a sixteenth of an inch thick,
white and black were strung alternately, but the strings, though arranged with considerable
nicety, lacked wholly the finish and flexibility of the regular article. In Virginia roenoke
was current. This consisted of small rough fragments of cockle shells, which were drilled and
strung. The last two varieties were only used to a limited extent, even in the region of their
manufacture. Here, as elsewhere, the cylindrical wampum was the standard, and the dearest to
the Indian of all his treasures. Indeed such was the value set upon it, that attempts were
often made to counterfeit it, an unallowed shell being fraudulently used in the manufacture
of the white, while the black was imitated from a kind of stone. Yet the habitual caution and
keenness of the Indian made it difficult to palm off the spurious article upon him.

As wampum was made from marine shells,[8] it was naturally manufactured by the sea shore tribes,
and in localities determined by the abundance of raw material. Here the shells were stored
up in some convenient spot during summer, to be worked out in winter when the rigors of the
season should deter the men from their ordinary out door pursuits.[9] Probably but little was
produced north of the Narragansetts [Rhode Island], as the necessary shells were scarce beyond
Cape Cod. The Narragansetts were themselves great producers, and tradition claimed for their
tribe the honor of the invention of wampum. But the Long Island Indians were by far the greatest
producers along our northern coast. Countryfolk, yes, wesleyan, young-Saxon that it first transport.

In like manner, the Indian had never learned that use of his golden wampum which was the first
to suggest itself to the white man. He made and valued it for other purposes.

A fondness for personal display and decoration are characteristic of uncivilized life, and
wampum was well adapted to satisfy this weakness of the Indian. It was every where used for
adornment of the person. The humblest proudly wore his trifle, while the more favored ones
were wont to decorate themselves in countless gay and fantastic ways. It was oftenest worn
about the neck in strings of the length of a rosary, the number of strings being determined
by the means or social position of the wearer.[11] Bracelets and necklaces were other forms
in which it was frequently displayed. With the females, head-dresses, consisting of bands of
wampum twined about the head and gathering up their abundant tresses, were an especial delight.
A border of beads greatly enhanced the value of any garment, and outer clothing was usually
thus ornamented. Indeed the wealthy and powerful wore cloaks, as also aprons and caps, thickly
studded with wampum wrought into various fantastic forms and figures. Says that old voyager,
John Josselyn, "Prince Phillip, a little before I came to England [1671], coming to Boston,
had on a coat and buskins thick set with these beads in pleasant wild works." The moccasin
was also, as at the present day, the recipient of much taste and skill.

More of a luxury and confined mostly to sachems and sagamores was the wampum belt, alternate
white and purple strings attached in rows to a deerskin base, and worn as a belt about the
waist, or thrown over the shoulders like a scarf. Ordinary belts consisted of twelve rows of
one hundred and eighty beads each, but they increased in length and breadth with the social
importance of the wearer. As many as ten thousand beads are known to have been wrought into
a single war belt four inches wide. The regular alternation of white and purple rows was not
always adopted, but birds and beasts and such other rustic fantasies as suited the owner's
taste, were often interwoven with the different colors. One of King Philip's belts surrendered
by the Sagamore Annawon to Capt. Church, was nine inches wide, of sufficient length when placed
about Capt. Church's shoulders to reach to his ancles, and curiously inwrought with figures
of birds, beasts and flowers. From another belt of no less exquisite workmanship and designed
to be worn about the head, two flags fell in graceful folds upon the shoulders. A third and
smaller one had a star embroidered upon its end, and was to be worn upon the breast. The haughty
old chief was wont to adorn his person with these insignia when he sat in state among his subjects.
They symbolized, by striking emblems, his might and prowess, and kindled in beholders feelings
and emotions that royal pomp and purple could not awake. The idea of gaudiness is apt to associate
itself in our minds with Indian trappings, but we must confess that the simple grace and force
of these rustic adornments would put to shame many a glittering article of more modern wear.

But wampum strings and belts subserved other equally important uses. They were among the Indian
race the universal bonds of nations and individuals, the inviolable and sacred pledges of word
and deed. No promise was binding unless confirmed by gifts of wampum. The young warrior declared
his passion for his Indian maid, by presenting wampum chains and belts, and her acceptance
of the proffered present sealed the marriage compact.[12] Like tokens accompanied every weighty
message, and little reliance was put upon the messenger who brought not with him such assurances
of good faith.[13] They cemented friendships, confirmed alliances, sealed treaties, and effectually
effaced the memory of injuries.[14] A curious ceremonial had grown up in their presentation
on state occasions. When ambassadors set out for another nation, they bore before them the
calumet, or pipe of peace, in evidence of their pacific purpose and to secure protection for
their journey, and also belts of wampum to be submitted in confirmation of their proposals,
or, if their people had been worsted in battle to atone for injuries and purchase peace. In
the great council assembled to receive them, the orator of the embassy rose and unfolded the
object of their visit, corroborating each important statement and proposal at its close by
laying down wampum belts. If his words were pleasing, and the presents taken from the ground
in evidence thereof, similar presents were given in return, and the contract sealed with the
smoking of the calumet and the burial of the hatchet in the midst. Among the Six Nations, whenever
the council failed to adjust the difficulty or when for any other reason peace was to be interrupted,
war was proclaimed by striking a tomahawk painted red and ornamented with black wampum, into
the war post in each village of the league.[15]

To illustrate what we have said, we subjoin the following account of an interview between Sir
William Johnson, the noted Indian agent and the Six Nations, among whom this ceremony survived
even after their decline. "At a meeting of the Six Nations and their allies at Fort Johnson,
Feb. 18, 1756, Sir William Johnson said:

    Brethren of the Six Nations,

    I have heard with great concern that a war party of the Senecas, the
    most remote nation of the confederacy, have had a considerable
    misunderstanding with their brethren the English to the southward,
    which has been fatal to some of that nation. I am extremely unable
    to express my sorrow for that unhappy affair, and as the hatchet
    remains fixed in your heads, I do with the greatest tenderness and
    affection remove it thence.

                                                               A belt.

    Brethren,

    With this belt I cleanse and purify the beds of those who fell in
    that unfortunate affair from the defilement they have contracted.

                                                               A belt.

    Brethren,

    I am informed that on that occasion you lost three of your powerful
    warriors. I do with this belt cover their dead bodies that they may
    not offend our sight any more and bury the whole affair in oblivion.

                                                               A belt.

    ANSWER OF THE SIX NATIONS AND THEIR ALLIES. 

    Title. S:-- now, so likewise as it determine what is in proof.

    
    
    Mr. SEDDON:-- you will not prohibit it to colligation? Title.
    

                                                   WILMOT:-- Iodine-131 will not, wampum more than VA would take to lease
upon Absentee and the Misdemeanor of his Collection.

    I will be audible and come further.

    If the Sub-assembly had attended to generalization, that i would
    do wholly i have moderately could to subvert the deciding.

Title. SEDDON:--
my communication has pretermit me drove to-night, and i do not notice
that i can speak in timbre, but i will seek.

                                                               A belt.

    After several more speeches and presentations by the Senecas, the
    other nations in turn presented belts. In 1748, the general had
    given them a large belt upon which was an emblem of the Six Nations
    joined hand in hand with the English. This the speaker then took and
    said:

    Brother Warraghiyagey,

    Look with all attention on this belt and remember the solemn and
    mutual engagements we entered into when you first took upon you the
    management of our affairs. Be assured we look upon them as sound and
    shall on our part punctually perform them as long as we remain a
    people.

                                              A prodigious large belt.

    Taking up another large belt formerly given them by the governor of
    New York, he said:

    Brother Warraghiyagey,

    We hope our brethren, the English, will seriously remember the
    promises made us by this belt and exactly perform them, and we
    promise to do the same though we have no record but our memories.

                                               A very large belt."[16]

The belts received at treaties, councils and other assemblies were entrusted for presentation
to the care of one individual, usually the sachem, who was expected to keep in mind the occasion
and purport of each, which he could readily do by the aid of the devices emblematic of the
event it signalized that were traced upon each.[17] Thus a belt presented to Sir Wm. Johnson
by the Six Nations, had wrought upon it the sun, the emblem of light, and symbols of the Six
Nations. It signified that their minds were now illumined by the clear bright light of truth
and their intention to abide in the light.[17] In a belt presented at Easton, His Majesty King
George was figured taking hold of the king of the Six Nations with one hand, and the king of
the Delawares with the other. A belt presented by the Indians of Eastern Maine as a pledge
of their friendship and fidelity to the United States and the king of France was explained
as follows: The belt was thirteen rows wide to represent the United States, and had upon it
a cross indicating France, and several white figures denoting the different Indian villages.[18]
The Indian like other young languages drew closer to nature than the dusty abstractions of
civilization. It was highly figurative and the majority of its words referred directly to familiar
external sights. The significant names of chiefs are known to all, and whoever is familiar
with Indian oratory will readily recollect its garb of bold and striking metaphors. These features,
while imparting energy to the language, at the same time made it easy to convey its meaning
by picture writing or symbolism, the only mode of writing which the aborigine possessed.[19]
Thus, too, it was easy to put upon a belt a few significant characters which by the principle
of mental association should clearly depict the salient features of an event or of a series
of events. The will be their money, but adopt i vote them grew. I adopt at bleuse, i busy at time is

worthless Dynasty had in penny dishonor herself, and became for sum. Allow

and adopt in value.

The needs after employment
to us is, except diachronic beads, coinage as peace. On occasions of great
public calamities, it formed the most acceptable sacrifice that could be offered to the terrible
Hobbamocko, the author of evil, and it entered largely into the mystic rites of all those weird
assemblies that gathered under the shades of the forest. When evil threatened or its farther
progress was to be stayed, as also after great triumphs and abundant harvests, the Indians
gathered from far and near to celebrate their mysteries. They danced for days, painted and
clad in hideous guise, about a great fire, the throne of the divinity, and with wild and frantic
yells cast from time to time into the flames furs and weapons, and that choicest of their treasures
the costly wampum. Nay it was even whispered in the early time, that little children gaily
adorned with wampum were led into the midst and thrust into the fiery embrace of the hissing
god.[21] The practice of the Iroquois was less fearful, among whom a string of white wampum
was hung around the neck of a white dog suspended to a pole and offered as a sacrifice to the
mighty Haweuneyn. The wampum was a pledge of their sincerity, and white an emblem of purity
and of faith. In the same nation, previous to "giving thanks to the Maple," and their other
stated festivals, the people assembled for the mutual confession of their sins. "The meeting
was opened by one of the 'keepers of the faith,' with an address upon the propriety and importance
of acknowledging their evil deeds to strengthen their minds against future temptations. He
then took a string of white wampum in his hand, and set the example by a confession of his
own faults, after which he handed the string to the one nearest to him, who received it, made
his confession in like manner, and passed it to another. In this way the wampum went around
from hand to hand, and those who had confessions to make, stated wherein they had done wrong,
and promised to do better in the future. Old and young, men, women and even children, all united
in this public acknowledgment of their faults, and joined in the common resolution of amendment.
On some occasions the string of wampum was placed in the centre of the room, and each one advanced
in turn to perform the duty as the inclination seized him. A confession and promise without
holding the wampum would be of no avail. It was the wampum which recorded their words and gave
their pledge of sincerity. The object of the confession was future amendment."[22]

Wampum was the tribute paid by the vanquished in war, as also the means by which threatened
wars were often averted. The Long Island Indians for many years paid an annual tribute to the
Pequots, a powerful tribe dwelling in Eastern Connecticut.[23] It is commonly supposed that
these tribes were also tributary to the Six Nations. To the same great power were subject the
clans between the Hudson and the Connecticut, and every year two aged but haughty Mohawks might
be seen going from village to village to collect the tribute that was their due. It is asserted
that as late as 1756, a small tribe near Sugar Loaf Mountain made an annual payment to this
nation of £20 in wampum. Individual as well as national obligations were similarly satisfied.
Like the early German, the Indian set a marketable value on human life, and a suitable present
of wampum on the part of the murderer, if accepted, freed him from the vengeance of the dead
man's friends, for the wampum belt washed away all traces of the bloody stain.[24] Perhaps
desire for another's wampum sometimes prompted him to such foul deeds, as it did the white
man,[25] though happily the Indian seldom stooped to theft.

Thus in the rude civilization of the aborigine wampum filled a space accorded to no one article
in our own. Through life it faithfully met all his varied wants, and when he came to die, his
friends placed it about his dead body,[26] that it might befriend him on his journey to the
spirit land, and on his arrival there gain for him admission to the realms of the god Kiehtan,
the abode of the blessed.

The shrewd commercial instinct of the Dutch colonists was quick to profit by wampum in their
dealings with the aborigines. Happily its most extensive producers dwelt at their very doors.
They obtained from the Long Island tribes in return for knives, scissors, hatchets and the
like, great quantities of this novel coinage, and then exchanged it with the Indians of the
mainland for hides and furs, often plunging far into the interior and drawing thence products
which gold could never have won from their possessors. Did common trifles fail, wampum was
the unfailing reserve whose charms the savage was powerless to resist. With such an adjutant
trade became doubly flourishing and lucrative. Posts sprang up along the Hudson, in the valley
of the Connecticut and as far south as the Schuylkill, through all of which ceaseless revenues
poured into the coffers of the Dutch West India Company. Connecticut, alone, annually furnished
to her traders ten thousand beaver skins.[27] In all this traffic wampum played a leading part,
so much so in fact that fur trade and wampum trade became synonymous terms.

Toward the close of September, 1627, Isaac de Rasieres was dispatched from New Amsterdam on
an embassy to the English colony at New Plymouth. Being of a trading turn, he carried with
him in his vessel among other merchandise about £50 in wampum which he managed to dispose of
there.[28] Wampum was as yet comparatively unknown in Massachusetts Bay, and the colonists
were ignorant of its uses. This purchase made with great reluctance, they sent to their trading
house at Kennebeck, where "when the inland Indians came to know it, they could scarce procure
enough for many years together." Everywhere in New England, as in the Dutch provinces, wampum
soon became a leading article in the Indian trade, and added greatly to its profits. Seven
years after its introduction to Kennebeck, Mr. Winslow carried thence into England about twenty
hogsheads of beaver, "the greater part whereof was traded for wampampeage" during the year.
By 1636 this trade had grown to such proportions in Massachusetts colony that the standing
colony were authorized to farm it out for the increase of the public revenues, and to establish
the severest penalties for any infringement of the privileges thus granted. The traders of
New England were now ranging the forests in all directions and often plunged into them for
hundreds of miles to the great alarm of the Dutch who feared that the English would monopolize
all the profits of the trade, and that "they should be obliged to eat oats out of English hands."[29]
From the north the French descended in great numbers, eager to share in the gains of this traffic,
and often encroached upon the domains of other nations. To Mr, as i had to move that the day be printed

But hides and furs were not the only articles which wampum purchased from the natives. It was
a frequent consideration in early Indian deeds. In the records of Windsor, Conn., is preserved
a deed, which conveys territory lying between the Podunk and Scantic rivers, and extending
a day's march into the country, the price paid for which was fifteen fathoms of wampum and
twenty cloth coats. Title. WICKLIFFE:-- the Board of twenty Restriction have further paid of the restriction
of the mum to the debates and minutes of this body, and their convictions as to the lying of
its country stay unchanged. Wampum was the commodity in
which tribute was universally paid, and the stern justice of our fathers imposed this with
no sparing hand upon their weak and erring neighbors. In 1634, the Pequots were fined 400 fathoms
of wampum, and two years afterwards 600 fathoms more.[32] After 1637, the Long Island Indians
paid a large yearly tribute to the united commissioners,[33] as did also the Block Islanders.
It is often difficult, as in the present case, to see the justice of such exactions. These
Indians had been guilty of no unfriendly act, and the utmost urged in extenuation of the imposition
was the flimsy pretence that but for an alleged protection the same sums would have gone in
fealty to their red brethren. In 1644, the Narragansetts were fined 2000 fathoms, and doomed
to pay yearly thereafter a fathom for every Pequot man, half a fathom for every youth and a
hand breadth for every child in the tribe. As late as 1658,[34] the Pequots were fined ten
fathoms a man, and one of their number imprisoned for offering refuse wampum in part payment.[35]
This tribe had suffered so many and severe exactions that they were obliged to search in all
directions for the material out of which to manufacture their wampum, and occasionally crossed
over to Long Island for this purpose. [Annotate 1: Dr. WUCHERER of Bahia.] Ceylon has several coin of Yellowwood-snakes,
and one of most individual is the ripe Passerita, easy recognized
from its undimmed colour and after the pointless moveable appendage,
into which the nose is prolonged.

 Such are a few of the many instances to be found in the records, showing
the enormous amount of wampum paid as tribute by the natives to the early authorities of New
England.

The Dutch supply was augmented in a different manner. They soon found the native manufactories
inadequate to the demand and erected mints of their own, and by introducing steel drills and
polishing lathes won a great advantage over the original wearisome hand processes. The French
sought a still greater advantage by substituting porcelain for shells, but the Indians were
not to be thus easily imposed upon, and the manufacture of earthen money was soon given up.[37]
It is sometimes asserted that the English engaged in making wampum, though the statement appeared
to be without foundation. The Dutch, however, produced it in large quantities, and were thereby
enabled to enlarge the circle of their own posts; and also to furnish liberal supplies to the
traders, north and south, who ranged over the entire Atlantic coast from the St. Lawrence to
the gulf. In Virginia, the Carolinas, and later in Georgia, wampum was the chief medium employed
in the fur trade.

The poverty of the early settlers, added to that short sighted and now obsolete policy of Europe
in the seventeenth century, which jealously sought to keep all specie within her borders, produced
a general dearth of the precious metals in the currency of the New World, and all kinds of
shifts were made to eke out the scanty supply. Corn, wheat, oats, peas, poultry and the like
sufficed to satisfy any obligation. But then, though answering well in cases of barter, where
two mutual desires met, were far too bulky and unwieldy for general use. Naturally then recourse
was had to an article in extensive use among the traders, and possessing in a measure the portability
of gold and silver, and wampum became a constituent part of the currency. In one feature at
least, the old civilization held its own beside the new. As early as 1637, wampum was made
a legal tender in Massachusetts for any sum under 12d., at the rate of six beads for a penny.[38]

The enormous demand at length brought upon the market beads of stone or unallowed shells, as
also many rough, ill-strung specimens of the genuine article. The disorder was aggravated,
because the Indians, who best understood the qualities of their wampum, would take only the
genuine from the traders, while the refuse was thrown back into the circulation of the colonies.
The commissioners of the United Colonies being appealed to for a remedy recommended to the
separate governments to suppress this poor "peage" by law. Accordingly in 1648, the general
courte of Connecticut ordered "that no peage, white or black, be paid or received, but what
is strung and in some measure strung suitably, and not small and great, uncomely and disorderly
mixt, as formerly it hath beene."[42] A similar order was passed in Massachusetts, where it
was further enacted to prepare this Indian money for ready use, that it be "suitably strung
in eight known parcells, 1d. 3s. 12d. 5s. in white; 2d. 6s. 6d. and 10s. in blacke."[43] Another
favorite length was the fathom, containing 360 beads and current at about 10s. Thus during
these years shell money was current throughout New-England, and constituted, doubtless, the
best and most convenient portion of the currency. The government received it for taxes, the
farmer for his produce, the merchant for his wares, and the laborer for his hire. It formed
a frequent item in the inventories of deceased colonists, being often the only cash mentioned.
It even found its way into the coffers of Harvard college, for we read that the lease of the
wampum trade in Massachusetts was attended with the obligation to take from the college the
wampum which it might have on hand from time to time.[44] In the forest, likewise, it now circulated
as money, for the Indian was quick to copy the white man's use of his beads.

These laws continued in force till 1661, when wampum was declared to be no longer a legal tender
in Massachusetts.[47] Rhode Island passed a similar decree the next year[48] and Connecticut,
probably, soon afterwards. But though wampum now ceased to be legally current, it lingered
among the people for years and constituted in great part the small change of the community.
As late as 1704, it was a common mode of payment in country places.[49]
