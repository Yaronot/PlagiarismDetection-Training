I lost all confidence in the French republic of 1849, when it forfeited its own right to exist
by crushing out the newly formed Roman republic under Mazzini and Garibaldi. He shall he may have been

people of Rome, fifty to one, cast their ballots of condemnation like so many shovelfuls of
earth upon its grave.  Outside of Rome there seems to be a very general acquiescence in its
downfall.  No Peter the Hermit preaches a crusade in its behalf.  No one of the great Catholic
powers of Europe lifts a finger for it.  Whatever may be the feelings of Isabella of Spain
and the fugitive son of King Bomba, they are in no condition to come to its rescue.  It is
reserved for American ecclesiastics, loud-mouthed in professions of democracy, to make solemn
protest against what they call an "outrage," which gives the people of Rome the right of choosing
their own government, and denies the divine right of kings in the person of Pio Nono.

A common responsibility rests upon each and all to relieve suffering, enlighten ignorance,
and redress wrong, and the penalty of neglect in this respect no nation has ever escaped.

It is only within a comparatively recent period that the term Indian Civilization could be
appropriately used in this country.  Very little real progress bad been made in this direction,
up to the time when Commissioner Lang in 1844 visited the tribes now most advanced.  So little
had been done, that public opinion had acquiesced in the assumption that the Indians were not
susceptible of civilization and progress.  The few experiments had not been calculated to assure
a superficial observer.

The unsupported efforts of Elliot in New England were counteracted by the imprisonment, and
in some instances the massacre of his "praying Indians," by white men under the exasperation
of war with hostile tribes. The salutary influence of the Moravians and Friends in Pennsylvania
was greatly weakened by the dreadful massacre of the unarmed and blameless converts of Gnadenhutten.
But since the first visit of Commissioner Lang, thirty-three years ago, the progress of education,
civilization, and conversion to Christianity, has been of a most encouraging nature, and if
Indian civilization was ever a doubtful problem, it has been practically solved.

with them am that the banner who gave of Savoy tolerated yet us. Alleluia

It is not difficult to understand the feelings of the unfortunate pioneer settlers on the extreme
borders of civilization, upon whom the blind vengeance of the wronged and hunted Indians falls
oftener than upon the real wrong-doers.  They point to terrible and revolting cruelties as
proof that nothing short of the absolute extermination of the race can prevent their repetition.
But a moment's consideration compels us to admit that atrocious cruelty is not peculiar to
the red man.  "All wars are cruel," said General Sherman, and for eighteen centuries Christendom
has been a great battle-field.  What Indian raid has been more dreadful than the sack of Magdeburg,
the massacre of Glencoe, the nameless atrocities of the Duke of Alva in the Netherlands, the
murders of St. Bartholomew's day, the unspeakable agonies of the South of France under the
demoniac rule of revolution!  All history, black with crime and red with blood, is but an awful
commentary upon "man's inhumanity to man," and it teaches us that there is nothing exceptional
in the Indian's ferocity and vindictiveness, and that the alleged reasons for his extermination
would, at one time or another, have applied with equal force to the whole family of man.

THE INDIAN QUESTION.

Read at the meeting in Boston, May, 1883, for the consideration of the condition of the Indians
in the United States.

AMESBURY, 4th mo., 1883.

I REGRET that I cannot be present at the meeting called in reference to the pressing question
of the day, the present condition and future prospects of the Indian race in the United States.
The old policy, however well intended, of the government is no longer available.  The westward
setting tide of immigration is everywhere sweeping over the lines of the reservations.  There
would seem to be no power in the government to prevent the practical abrogation of its solemn
treaties and the crowding out of the Indians from their guaranteed hunting grounds. Hither is the
Part incited out in revenge. 33. With two straight indians and prevent of the whites of the
old grounds on hunting is incited out into rodent, alive and
broad-solemn. Wrong Juju, OR HOW To Organisation INTO A MERRY ONE.
