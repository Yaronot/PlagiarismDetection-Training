CHAPTER I

JOSEPH HAYDN

It is, as a rule, inexpedient to begin a book with the peroration. Children are spared the
physic of the moral till they have sucked in the sweetness of the tale. Adults may draw from
a book what of good there is in it, and close it before reaching the chapter usually devoted
to fine writing. But the case of Haydn is extraordinary. One can only sustain interest in a
biography of the man by an ever-present sense that he is scarcely to be written about. All
an author can do is, in few or many words, to put a conundrum to the reader--a conundrum that
cannot even be stated in exciting terms. The Effect haul them complained on lodge, reaching Madonna'and

 All
the severer men wrote in this form, most of them displaying marvellous mathematical--and some
of them, alas! mechanical--ingenuity; a few of them, Bach towering high above the rest, attained
a full and truthful expression of deep feeling. Bach, for the organ alone, raised sublime architectural
structures, unapproachable, to use Schumann's word, in their magnificence. But the underlying
feeling was always the same throughout; it might wax or wane in intensity: its character did
not change. The themes, once announced, were rigid and unalterable; the music had always to
be more or less like "a tune tied to a post." Dramatic changes of mood had no place. So later,
a voice had to be found for shifting, complex, theatrically conflicting moods--states of mind
characteristic of the modern and not of the bewigged world. When Haydn was still young the
problem composers were more or less at random trying to solve was the creation of a new form
of music and a new kind of music to fill the form. Neither the old form nor the old style would
serve; the naïve dance-forms were too short. The content had to be as poignantly expressive,
as direct in its appeal, as a folk-song; the different passages uttering the different moods
had somehow to be welded together into a coherent whole--in one way or another dramatic climaxes
and changes had to be arranged in an unbroken, logical, apparently inevitable sequence. I do
not say the composers knew what they were after; on the contrary, as in the beginnings of anything
new in any art, they simply were vaguely groping after something, they did not by any means
realise what.

During the period when the polyphonic writers were pouring out their most glorious and living
stuff, in the first lame, crude fugues the medium was being prepared for the triumphs of Handel
and Bach; and in the same way, while Bach was writing the G minor and A minor fugues (I am
not speaking of vocal music) some smaller men were working at what was destined to grow into
the symphony, sonata and quartet. These terms are used here in their present-day signification.
In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries such words as symphony and overture, and suite
and sonata, were interchangeable; but that does not at all concern us here. The symphony or
sonata or quartet form is what these early groups of movements led up to. That these groups
of movements originated in the theatre is quite probable; this is indicated by the mere fact
that the word "overture" was frequently used to describe them. When the fugue was in its fullest
maturity composers were turning overtures out in vast quantities. Our own Arne tried his hand
at them, and no one looking at his would dream that the sonata form was so nearly ripe at the
time. Emanuel and Johann Christian Bach wrote them, and from these two Haydn got the hint which
he turned to such splendid account. Abel, Stamitz and Wagenseil wrote them, and achieved nothing
in particular. These groups consisted of three or four movements, and we need not linger long
over them. It goes without saying that all the movements were short; they consisted either
of simple tunes or of series of harmonic progressions broken up into figures or patterns. Of
real development and climax there is none; of such things as well-defined, characteristic first
and second subjects there is little sign. The themes were of the formal mathematical type developed
during the fugal period--a type that "worked" easily, and in a way effectively, in the fugue
itself, but was unnecessary and, indeed, tiresome when contrapuntal working was not the aim
and object. The endless variants on this kind of thing, for example--

were simply a snare, and kept writers from seeing the importance of singing and singable melody
in the coming style. To show the difference between the old and the new at once, let me here
give two bits of themes from Mozart and Haydn. They are in appearance not so far removed from
the contrapuntal type of theme, and while they sing themselves they yet served their inventors
capitally for contrapuntal treatment.

Numberless sonatas were written about the same time. Either the subjects were contrapuntal,
formal, in build, or consisted of patterns made out of broken chord-series. Domenico Scarlatti
got some wonderful results; but his music simply tickles the ear for a moment: meaning it has
none. Polyphonic music of every sort had now to go for a while; monodic music was coming in.
But before it could come in with any degree of security something else had to come and something
else to go. Up till now the old idea of modes had remained strong, despite Sebastian Bach and
his marvellous use of chromatic harmonies. It had to yield to the modern idea of key; a sense
of key relationships had to be developed--much, at first all, depended on that. The new idea,
hinted at by Emanuel Bach, and first seized upon by Haydn, was that a continuous stream of
melody--not necessarily always in the top or treble part--should run through a movement, and,
whatever the interest of the accompanying parts, should always be of the first importance.
For his inspiration, as well as many of his actual themes, Haydn went to his native folk-dances
and folk-songs; he brought in the fresh air from the wilds, and the now dusty contrapuntalism
was blown out never again to return. We can see above the difference between the full-bottomed
wig theme and the newer kind; to show, on the other hand, how near Haydn stood to Beethoven
let me give bits of themes from each composer.

With the disappearance of the contrapuntal theme coincides the end of purely contrapuntal "working"
or development. The new kind I shall describe later in its proper place. For the present all
that need be said is that here again key relationship was of the first importance, as we shall
see. Meantime, in this peroration I have sought to outline what Haydn did. For, let there be
no mistake, it was Haydn and no other who brought about the change. If he was not the first
to write in something very like modern sonata or symphony form, he was the first to see its
full possibilities. Had he written no symphonies, but only quartets, his achievement would
have been none the less remarkable, and none the less valuable to Mozart and Beethoven, for
in many respects the quartet and the symphony of the eighteenth century were the same thing,
and Mozart declared that it was from Haydn he learnt to write quartets.

This, then, is what Haydn did, and I shall now describe shortly what we must call his career
while he was working it out.

CHAPTER II

1732-1761

The first period of Haydn's life is marked by the two above dates--that of his entry into this
world and that of his entry into the service of Prince Anton Esterhazy. He was born, then,
in 1732, "between March 31 and April 1." As there is no "between" possible, either the Haydn
family had no clock or were averse to stating definitely that their son was born on All Fool's
Day. They need not have worried, for, however simple Haydn might be, he was only once in his
whole life a fool, which is more than can be said for most men, great or small. But while he
was about it, there was no lack of completeness in Haydn's folly, and he felt the consequences
of it all his days. The place of his birth was originally called Tristnik, translated into
German, Rohrau, then (whatever it may be now) a sleepy old-world village on the banks of the
Leitha, in the very heart of a Croatian settlement in Hungary. The Leitha at Rohrau divides
Hungary from Austria. Haydn's father, Mathias Haydn, said to have been a master-wheelwright,
came from Hainburg, near to the Danube, and some little distance from Rohrau. More cannot be
said of his ancestors than that for some generations they had been hard-working, honest folk
of the peasant class, given to music, but by no means a family of musicians like the Bachs.
His mother was born Maria Koller, and it has been suggested that the name is a variant or corruption
of the Croatian Kolar, meaning a wheelwright. Perhaps she thought that, bearing such a name,
she must marry Mathias, a wheelwright. The point is that this fact, if fact it be, is another
indication or proof of Haydn's Croatian descent. It seems, indeed, to be established that by
blood he was pure Slav, the name being formerly spelt Hajdgn. It is just as well for our tongues
that it was changed. Franz Joseph (he dropped the Franz) was the second of twelve children,
the only other worth noting being Michael (in full, Johann Michael), who became a famous musician
in his day, and a friend of the Mozarts in Salzburg. Maria, the mother, died in 1754, the father
in 1763.

It has always seemed to me the great composers had fine luck in being born so long ago, before
the towns had grown big and dirty, before the locomotive and motor-car had denied the beautiful
earth, and stinking factories floundered over all the lands. Carlyle rightly grows eloquent
on the value of the sweet country air and sights and sounds to young Teufelsdröckh, and Haydn
must have taken impressions of sunrises, sunsets, midday splendours, and the ever-plashing
river flowing to the far-away sea, that afterwards went to the making of his most wonderful
music. He had to go out early to fight his way in the world; only six years of peaceful village
life, free from care and responsibility, were allowed him. Those first years, I take it, were
happy enough. Mathias was only, it is true, a wheelwright, and in time there were a dozen mouths
to feed. But we hear of him and Maria making music only in the evenings; his days were more
profitably occupied. It goes very much without saying that he was not rich--in what age or
clime are working wheelwrights rich?--but he cannot be called poor. Poverty is a comparative
term; even to-day peasants feel its biting teeth only when they desert or are driven from their
country-side, and make for the overcrowded towns. Joseph, but for a few accidents, might have
remained a peasant all his days, and never faced what he would consider hardship. The first
accident was his voice, which was undoubtedly of singular beauty; the second was an extraordinary
musical aptitude, which led him to sing expressively and perfectly in tune the airs he heard
his father and mother sing. Mathias, by the way, accompanied himself on the harp; and Joseph,
long before he had a fiddle of his own, imitated the fiddling of his elders with two bits of
wood, so the family orchestra was complete. The last accident was the arrival of one Frankh,
a distant relative. This was long before the magical feats of the baby Mozart had set every
grasping parent staring for signs of musical precocity in his children. But Mathias undoubtedly
wanted to do his best for his boy, and Joseph himself must have had ambition of a sort--witness
his endeavours to play the fiddle without a fiddle to play--and when Frankh undertook to place
the boy in a choir and teach him music, the offer was joyfully accepted. So he went to Hainburg,
never to return to Rohrau until he was an old and celebrated man.

Nothing need be recorded of his life in Hainburg save that Frankh worked him hard. Indeed,
much later Haydn declared himself thankful to Frankh for forming in him the habit of working
hard. He sang, played the fiddle and harpsichord, and went to school; and suddenly one George
Reutter came on the scene. He came, heard, and was conquered by Haydn's voice. He was Hofcompositor
and Kapellmeister at St. Stephen's Church in Vienna, and he took the boy on the same terms
as those on which Frankh had brought him away from Rohrau. To Vienna Haydn went, was entered
in the Cantorei of St. Stephen's, and there for some years he sang in the choir. In return
he was taught reading, writing and arithmetic, religion and Latin. He had excellent masters
for singing and for violin and harpsichord; but he had no teaching in theory. Reutter gave
him only two lessons, and he was left without guidance to cover as much music-paper as he could
get hold of. But he stuck grimly to the task of making himself an efficient composer, and worked
out his own salvation. Reutter, having secured him for his voice, took no interest in him,
and when the voice went Haydn had to go too. That happened in 1745. His brother Michael came,
with a voice superior to Joseph's; Joseph's broke, and the Empress said his singing was like
a cock's crowing. Michael sang a solo so beautifully as to win a present of 24 ducats, and
since it was evident that the services of St. Stephen's could go on without Joseph, Reutter
waited for a chance of getting rid of Joseph. So Joseph, though far from wishing to oblige,
must needs play a practical joke, and was ignominiously spanked and turned out into the streets.

With both Frankh and Reutter he had had a hard enough time--plenty of work, not too much food,
and no petting--but now he learnt what hard times really meant. He faced them with plenty of
courage. A chorister of St. Michael's gave him shelter; some warmhearted person--to whom be
all praise--lent him the vast sum of 140 florins--say £7; he got a few pupils who paid him
two florins a month. He must have toiled like a slave, in a wet, cold garret, and often without
sufficient to eat. Yet, as in everything he undertook, dogged did it. He never became a splendid
executant, like Bach and Handel before him, and Mozart and Beethoven immediately after, but
he must have been head and shoulders above the ordinary musical practitioner.

His first opportunity came when he made the acquaintance of one Felix Kurz, a well-known comic
actor, for whom he wrote the comic opera, Der Neue Krumme Teufel. This, judging from the places
it was played at, seems to have had quite a vogue. The music is lost; I have never seen the
words. But through this operetta or pantomime with songs he appears to have been introduced
to Metastasio, who was, of course, a mighty great man at that epoch--a kind of Scribe. Anyhow,
Metastasio was superintending the education of the two daughters of a Spanish family, the de
Martines, and Haydn was engaged to teach the elder music. Metastasio brought him to the notice
of Porpora--then quite as important a person as Metastasio himself--and Porpora made Haydn
an offer. Haydn was to clean the boots and do other household jobs, and he was to accompany
when Porpora gave lessons. In return, he was to have lessons from Porpora and to be fed and
clothed. He accepted, and went off with his new master to Mannersdorf.

His service with Porpora brought him innumerable advantages. If he had lowly duties to attend
to, that amounted to nothing. He lived in the eighteenth century, not in the nineteenth or
twentieth. He was not regarded as a clever musician forced to do lackey's work; he was a lackey--or,
at least, a peasant--given a chance of making himself a clever musician. In those days birth
and breeding counted for much--everything. If a man could not boast of these, then he must
have money; and even money would not always fetch him everything. The Court musicians were
classed lower than domestic servants, and generally paid less. Now and again a triumphant,
assertive personality like Handel would break through all the rules of etiquette; but even
Handel could have done little without his marvellous finger-skill--for he was reckoned finest
amongst the European players of his time--and with his fingers Haydn--we have his own confession
for it--was never extraordinary. He could not extemporise as Handel, and Bach in more restricted
circles, had done, nor as Mozart and Beethoven were soon to do. Beethoven won social status
for the musician tribe, but Beethoven, while as brilliant an executant as Handel, also had
the advantage of reaching manhood just when the upset of the French Revolution was destroying
all old-world notions. Even in old-fashioned Germany the Rights of Man were asserting themselves.
In England, for many a long day afterwards, the musician had no higher standing than Haydn
had. The few who mixed with the Great were mainly charlatans of the type of Sir George Smart,
and they took mighty pains to be of humble behaviour in the presence of their betters.

Haydn did remarkably well in the petty pigtail courts of Austria. He probably considered himself
lucky, and he was lucky--he was always lucky. He got invaluable experience with Porpora, and
was presented to many personages in the gay world. He met Gluck, who a little later was quite
inaccessible to the most pushful of young men; also Dittersdorf and Wagenseil, who, whatever
we may think of them, were very high and unapproachable musicians in their time. He worked
with unflagging diligence, and the natural instinct of his genius drove him to the works of
Emanuel Bach, which he now possessed. He also bought theoretical books, prizing chiefly the
Gradus of old Fux. So he mastered the groundwork of his art. Gluck advised him to go to Italy,
but it is hard to imagine what he could have learnt there. He did not fail to profit by an
introduction to one Karl (etc.) von Fürnberg, one of the old stamp of wealthy patrons of musicians.
They loved to "discover" rising talent, did these ancient, obsolete types of amateurs of art.
They were as proud of a brilliant protégé as a modern literary critic is when he "discovers"
a new minor poet. Von Fürnberg did his best for Haydn. He enabled him to write the first eighteen
quartets; he helped him to get better terms for teaching--five florins a month instead of two.
Through von Fürnberg or some one else he got to know the Countess Thun, who loved to play the
friend to struggling genius. Finally, he was presented to Count Morzin, who, in 1759, appointed
him as his composer and bandmaster. The band was small and the pay was small, but it placed
Haydn in an assured position. He had a band to practise on, and he soon wrote his first symphony.
Count Morzin's home was at Lukavec. Here incessant concerts, vocal and instrumental, were given.
Trios, quartets, symphonies, concertos, divertimentos--all kinds of compositions, and plenty
of them, were required of Haydn, who must have had his hands everlastingly full.

He now evidently thought the days of his apprenticeship over, and proceeded at once to make
a thorough fool of himself--as I have said, for the only time in his life. He was friendly
with the family of a wig-maker named Keller, and gave lessons to his two daughters. He fell
in love with the younger. That might have been well enough. But the girl elected to become
a nun, and Haydn, either of his free and particularly asinine will, or through persuasion,
married the elder, Anne Marie, on November 26, 1760. He was fully aware that his master, Count
Morzin, would keep no married man in his employ, so that his act was doubly foolish. However,
as it happened, that did not so much matter. Morzin had to rid himself of such an expensive
encumbrance as an orchestra, and, marriage or no marriage, Haydn would have found himself without
a post. He quickly got another position, so that one bad consequence of hasty marriage did
not count. The other consequence remained--he still had a wife. She was, from all accounts,
a demon of a wife. He had to separate from her, and long afterwards she wrote to him asking
him to buy her a certain house which would suit her admirably as soon as he was good enough
to leave her a happy widow. It is satisfactory to know that Haydn bought the house for himself,
and lived in it, and that the lady died before him, though only eight years.

He had borne privation, hunger, cold, wet beds to sleep in, with the inveterate cheeriness
that never left him. He worked on steadily until his old age in the service he now entered--that
of Prince Anton Esterhazy. Until the year 1791, when he adventured far away for the first time
to come to London, his outward life was as regular and uneventful as that of a steady Somerset
House clerk. There is next to nothing to record, and I will spare the patient reader the usual
stock of fabulous anecdotes, the product of hearsay and loose imaginations. Let us turn for
a moment to what he had learnt and actually achieved during the first thirty years of his life.

CHAPTER III

THE EARLY MUSIC

Save one quartet, I have heard none of the compositions of Haydn's first period. Their interest
is mainly historical, and the public cannot be blamed for never evincing the slightest desire
to hear them. Haydn had, indeed, a glimmering of the new idea--perhaps more than a glimmering;
but, on the whole, he was still in leading strings, and dared not follow the gleam. It is not
surprising. He was not one of Nature's giant eruptive forces, like Beethoven. His declared
object always was to please his patrons; and consider who his patrons were. We may be sure
that the "discords" of a Beethoven suddenly blared forth would have scared Count Morzin and
all his pigtail court. Haydn was supposed to write the same kind of music as other musicians
of the period were writing, and, if possible, to do it better; Count Morzin did not pay him
to widen the horizons of an art. Consider his musical position also. He was born twenty-seven
years before the death of Handel, eighteen before that of the greatest Bach; Bach was writing
gigantic works in the contrapuntal style and forms; Handel had not composed the chain of oratorios
on which his fame rests. It is conceivable that had Haydn been born in less humble circumstances,
that had he easily reached a high position, he, too, might have commenced writing fugues, masses
and oratorios on a big scale--and be utterly forgotten to-day. His good luck thrust him into
a lowly post, and by developing the forms in which he had to compose, and seeking out their
possibilities, he became a great and original man.

It is hard, of course, to say how much any given discoverer actually discovers for himself,
and how much is due to his predecessors and contemporaries. The thing certain is that the great
man, besides finding and inventing for himself, sums up the others. All the master-works have
their ancestry, and owe something to contemporary works. The only piece of music I know for
which it is claimed that it leaped to light suddenly perfect, like Minerva from Jupiter's skull,
is "Sumer is icumen in," and almost as many authors have been found for it as there are historians.
The bones of John of Fornsete (or another) have long since mouldered, and it need not disturb
their dust to say that in all certainty there were many canons--hundreds, perhaps thousands--before
"Sumer is icumen in" had the good fortune to be put in a safe place for posterity to stare
and wonder at. This is platitudinous, but it needs to be borne in mind. And, bearing it in
mind, we can see in Haydn's early attempts much in a style that had been used before or was
being used at the time, much that is simply copied from the younger Bachs, from Domenico Scarlatti,
Dittersdorf, Wagenseil, perhaps even his Parisian contemporary Gossec. But we see the character
of the themes becoming more and more his own. There are no--or few--contrapuntal formulas,
hardly any mere chord progressions broken into arpeggios and figurated designs. By going to
the native dances and folk-tunes of his childhood Haydn took one of the most momentous, decisive
steps in his own history and in the history of music. That too much quoted opening of the first
quartet (B-flat) really marks the opening of an era. It was not a subject to be worked out
contrapuntally; it was not sufficiently striking harmonically to tempt Haydn, as themes of
an allied sort had constantly tempted Emanuel Bach, to make music and gain effects by repeating
it at intervals above or below. It is an arpeggio of the chord of B-flat; it leaps up merrily,
and has a characteristic delightful little twist at the end, and in the leap and in the twist
lay possibilities of a kind that he made full use of only in his maturer style. All composers
up till then, if they ventured to use bits of popular melody at all, gave them the scholastic
turn, either because they liked it, or because the habit was strong. The fact that Haydn gave
it in its naïve form, invented themes which in their deliberate naïveté suggest folk-song and
dance, hints at what his later music proves conclusively, that he found his inspiration as
well as his raw material in folk-music.

The business of the creative artist is to turn chaos into cosmos. He has the welter of raw
material around him; the shaping instinct crystallizes it into coherent forms. For that intellect
is indispensable, and almost from the beginning Haydn's intellect was at work slowly building
his folk-music into definite forms easily to be grasped. Gradually the second subject differentiates
itself from the first while maintaining the flow of the tide of music; and gradually we get
the "working-out" section, in which the unbroken flow is kept up by fragments of the two subjects
being woven into perpetually new melodic outlines, leading up to the return of the first theme;
and the second theme is repeated in the key of the first, with a few bars of coda to make a
wind-up satisfactory to the ear.

Here let us observe the value of key relationships. The first subject was given out in the
key (say) of C. A momentary pause was made, and the second subject introduced in the dominant
key G, and in this key the first section of a piece of music in symphony-form ends. That ending
could not satisfy the ear, which demanded something more in the first key. Until recent times
that desire was gratified with a repetition of the whole first section. The repetition of the
first theme in the first key satisfied the ear for the moment, though at the end of the section
the want was again felt. So when the end of the first section was again reached a modulation
was made, gradually or suddenly, to another key; and in the course of this, the development
or "working-out" section, many keys might be touched on, but without ever giving the ear the
satisfaction of feeling itself at rest in the first key again. That was only done by the reintroduction
of the first theme in the first key. The first theme is played and leads on to the pause, after
which the second theme is given in the key of the first, so that after a few bars of coda,
always in the same key, the movement terminates in a perfectly satisfactory manner. This is
a crude description in which much is left out, but it will serve to enable the reader to understand
how passages widely different in character are bound together into a coherent whole by the
composer continuously leading the ear to expect something--that something being the original
key-chord, and, while offering many things, only finally satisfying the ear's craving when
the movement is coming to a finish. If the second theme, let us say, were in the same key as
the first, it would sound like the beginning of a new movement, and at once we should have
the continuity broken. As a passage between two passages in the original key it sounds perfectly
in its place, and, no matter how contrasted in character, is a kind of continuation of the
first passage. At the same time it creates a strong desire, that must be restrained till the
time comes, for what follows. We listen to the second theme and to the "working-out" section,
knowing we are far from home, but perfectly aware that we shall get there, and that a certain
feeling of suspense will be relieved. Thus the music is like a great arch that supports itself.
The unity got in the fugue by continuous motion is got here by one key perpetually leading
the ear to ask for another key. It seems simplicity itself; its underlying idea--that of making
the ear always expect something, and gratifying it by bits, and only fully towards the close
of the movement--is that by which unity is combined with variety in modern music, though we
have long since got rid of the "legitimate" series of keys.

The grouping of the movements need not detain us long. Many groupings had been tried; but it
seems natural to open with an allegro--preceded or not preceded by a few bars of slow introduction--to
follow this with a slow movement of some sort; then to insert or not to insert a movement of
medium rapidity as a change from the bustle of the first and the quiet of the second; and finally
to end with a merry dancing movement. This, again, is in the merest outline the plan adopted
by Haydn. Whether he used three or four movements, the principle was the same--a quick beginning,
a slow middle, and a quick ending; afterwards, each movement grew longer, but the way in which
he lengthened them can better be treated later when we come to his bigger works.

From the first he used counterpoint, canon, imitation, and all the devices of the contrapuntal
style. But the difference between his newer style and that of Wagenseil and the rest is that
he neither uses counterpoint of any sort nor chord figures to make up the true substance of
the music, but merely as devices to help him in maintaining a continuous flow of melody. That
melody, as has already been said, might be in the top or bottom part, or one of the middle
parts; but though it may, and, indeed, always did pause at times, as the melody of a song pauses
at the end of each line, it is unbroken from beginning to end. The first part of a movement
might be compared to the first line of a song: there is a pause, but we expect and get the
second line; there is another pause, and we get a line which is analogous to the "working-out"
section, and the last line, ending in the original key if not on the same note, corresponds
to the final section of the movement, after which we expect nothing more, the ear being quite
satisfied.

Werner, his musical chief in his next station, had the sense to see that this continuous melody
was the thing aimed at, and because Haydn placed counterpoint in a subsidiary condition he
called him a "charlatan." Poor man, had his sense pierced a little deeper! For Haydn was--after
Bach and Handel and Mozart--one of the finest masters of counterpoint who have lived. When
the time came to write fugues he could write them with a certain degree of power. But his aim
was not writing fugues any more than an architect's aim is painting in water-colours. Water-colours
are very useful to architects, and they make use of them; but because they do not rival Turner
or David Cox it does not follow that they are not masters of the art of architecture. Haydn
aimed at--or rather, at this epoch, groped after--a kind of music in which continuous melody
expressive of genuine human feeling was the beginning and the end, and his mastery of counterpoint,
harmony, and all technical devices were more than sufficient for the purpose.

To my mind he wrote as well for the strings at this time as ever he did. He could play the
violin himself, as the violin was then played, and all his life, even in quartets, he had to
write for players who would be considered tenth-rate to-day. As for orchestration, that was
an art neither he nor Mozart was to hit upon for some time. The wind instruments had one principal
function, and that was to fill in the music, enrich it, and make it louder, and another minor
one--occasionally to put in solos. In writing suitably for them, and, in fact, in every other
part of writing music for courts, Haydn was now the equal, if not the superior, of every man
living in 1761 (Gluck did not write for the courts), and he was getting a better and better
grip of his new idea.

CHAPTER IV

1761-1790

Haydn went to Eisenstadt, in Hungary, in 1761 to take up the duties of his new post--that of
second Kapellmeister to Prince Anton of Esterhazy. In that year feudal Europe had not been
shaken to the foundations by the French Revolution; few in Europe, indeed, and none in sleeping
German Austria, dreamed that such a shaking was at hand, and that royal and ducal and lesser
aristocratic heads, before the century was out, would be dear at two a penny. Those drowsy
old courts--how charming they seem on paper, how fascinating as depicted by Watteau! Yet one
wonders how in such an atmosphere any new plants of art managed to shoot at all. The punctilious
etiquette, the wigs, the powder, the patches, the grandiloquent speechifyings, the stately
bows and graceful curtsies, the prevalence--nay, the domination--of taste, what a business
it all was! The small electors, seigneurs, dukes and what not imitated the archducal courts;
the archdukes mimicked the imperial courts: all was stiff, stilted, unnatural to a degree that
seems to us nowadays positively soul-killing, devilish. But some surprising plants grew up,
some wondrous fruits ripened in them. A peasant-mind, imbued with peasant-songs, was set in
one; the peasant-mind in all outward matters conformed to all the rules, and was loved by the
petty princes to whom it was never other than highly, utterly respectful, and lo! the peasant-songs
blew and blossomed into gigantic art forms, useful to the composers who came in a time when
feudalism was as clean swept away as the wigs and patches that were its insignia. To change
this rather too eloquent trope, Haydn, living a life of deadly routine and dulness, duly subservient
to his divinely appointed betters, took the songs of the people (who paid to keep the whole
apparatus in working order), and out of them built up what is the basis of all the music written
since. If Providence in very deed ordained that millions of men and women should toil that
a few small electors, dukes and princes should lead lives of unhappy artificial luxury, then
Providence did well at the same time to arrange for a few counts such as Morzin, and princes
like those of Esterhazy.

Haydn's chief in musical affairs was old Werner. His salary was at first £40, and he was passing
rich on it; and it was soon raised to £79. We need trouble no further as to whether on such
wages he was poor or rich: he evidently considered himself well-to-do. In fact, even in those
days, when copyright practically did not exist, he continually made respectable sums by his
compositions, and after he had been twice to England, ever the Hesperides' Garden of the German
musician, he was a wealthy man, and was thankful for it. Chapter. Excepting eight. "magnificence,

 The band consisted at the beginning
of sixteen chosen players, but the number was increased afterwards. The only events in his
life were the smaller or larger fêtes for which he prepared the music. For instance, in 1763
Anton, the son of Nicolaus, was married, and Haydn composed a pastoral, Acis and Galatea, which
was duly performed. Again, in 1764 Prince Nicolaus attended the coronation of the Archduke
Joseph; his return was one of these events, and to celebrate it Haydn wrote a grand cantata.
A Life of him at this period would be a list of his compositions, with a few notes about the
occasions that prompted them. Such a list I am not minded to prepare. The publishers' catalogues
exist, and as for the various fêtes, one was very much like another; and those folk who do
not find accounts of them insufferably tedious can find out about them in one of the larger
biographies.

In 1767 the Prince, Haydn, band and all, took up their residence at the palace of Esterház.
A few singers and players were left at Eisenstadt to keep up the chapel services, and doubtless
had an easy time; the rest were worked almost to death. Esterház was a gorgeous, if solitary,
residence. Built on a morass far from the busy world, it was the scene of constant hospitality
and great functions. There were two theatres--one, as I understand the matter, entirely for
marionette shows; the scenery was regarded at the time as excellent. Most of the operas were
sung in Italian by Italian singers; even books of the words were printed. In short, the opera
at the Palace of Esterház seems to have been in no respect very different from the fashionable
opera of to-day. Singers were engaged for a year or a longer period; casual artists called,
and were engaged for one performance or more, and having been rewarded according to their deserts,
passed on their way. Great personages visited the Prince in state, and were regally entertained,
Haydn everlastingly writing special music. Maria Theresa stayed for three days in 1773, and
thus we get the Empress Theresa symphony in C, also two operas of sorts, L'Infideltà Delusa
and Philemon and Baucis, specially composed for the occasion. What with retinues of servants
bustling about, banquets, balls, hunting-parties, dramas, operas, concerts, the scene must
have always been lively enough--there can have been nothing of stagnation. When the Prince
went on visits he also travelled in state, and took his band and singers with him. When at
home, we read, the artists spent their spare time at the café; but I cannot think that Haydn
ever had much leisure.

It was not until 1769 that Prince, conductor, band, singers and all visited Vienna. Nothing
remarkable occurred. To celebrate the great and joyful event Haydn wrote one opera, La Spezziata,
which was given at the house of von Sommerau--then they went back to Esterház, and saw no more
of Vienna for eight years. Of this eight years there is nothing to set down save a list of
compositions. How the man, such a man--for in his quiet methodical way he loved pleasure--stood
it at all, I don't know, but stand it he did. However, in 1776-1777 there was a little diversion.
Haydn composed an opera, La Vera Constanza, for the Court theatre in Vienna, and intrigues
for some rival composer--his name does not matter--began. A rival won the first round in the
contest; his opera was produced. In disgust Haydn had his score taken away, and it was soon
sung at Esterház. I suppose Haydn would have considered it a sin to waste good material. Moreover,
it was given at a suburban theatre of Vienna, and it proved so far successful that Artaria,
the publisher, thought it worth while to engrave half a dozen songs and a duet from it. The
opera which beat his at the Court theatre is utterly forgotten; we know of the other because
of the composer's name. Some years later, in 1784, he had another touch of the ways of men
in the busy world, sent, perhaps, to reconcile him to his habitual seclusion. As far back as
1771 he had written his first oratorio--which I am not ashamed to say I have never looked at--Il
Ritorno di Tobia. It was performed, apparently with éclat, by the Vienna Tonkünstler Societät,
of which body Haydn wished to become a member. He put down his name, and paid his subscription,
and was not a little surprised to learn that the condition on which alone he would be elected
was that he should compose works for the society whenever he was asked. Now, those works would
have become the society's property, if only because they alone would have the scores, and Haydn
was a busy man, a man of European reputation, whose music was worth money, and a shrewd business
man, who saw no fun in throwing money away. His annoyance may be conceived. He withdrew his
subscription--it is a wonder they would let him have it--and would have nothing to do with
the society until after his return from England in 1791, when the feud was ended, and he was
triumphantly elected senior assessor--whatever that may be. What the society was thinking in
the first instance I cannot guess, unless it was that a mere professional composer and Kapellmeister
should pay double, or considerably more than double, for the honour of belonging to so distinguished
a body of amateurs. Anyhow, in the long run Haydn was so well pleased with them that he seems
to have made over to them The Creation and The Seasons, from which they derived profits that
enabled them to keep their heads above water when darker days came. Long before this date,
however, honours were being thrown at him. His opera, L'Isolu Disabilite, to Metastasio's words,
was sung in concert form at Vienna in 1779, and the Accademia Filarmonica of Modena made him
a member; Haydn sent the score to the King of Spain, who repaid the compliment with a gold
snuff-box. In the same year he got a little relief from the unbroken routine of his duties,
for the theatre at Esterház was burnt to the ground, and Prince Nicolaus, seeing no means of
passing his evenings, took a trip to Paris. Whether, from Haydn's point of view, he did well
or not is open to question; for a fiddler named Polzelli had come to Esterház, and Haydn could
find nothing better to do than flirt with his wife Luigia. He did more than flirt--he went
a trifle further, and the lady took full advantage of his infatuation. She everlastingly importuned
him for money, and made him sign a promise to marry her if ever he should be free to do so.
Finally, the trouble came to an end somehow; but in his will Haydn left the lady an allowance
for life.

The new theatre was built, and reopened in 1780 with a representation of La Fideltà Premiare.
This pleased every one so much that it was given once at a concert under Haydn's direction,
that the Emperor Joseph might hear it, and it led to Artaria, who was a very great gun in the
publishing line of business, taking him up in serious earnest. Life went on much as it had
done before the fire, or, if it was not quite so monotonous, it was still dull enough. Honours
came to him from abroad, and when in Vienna he made the acquaintance of many more or less celebrated
men. Michael Kelly is well worth reading on the subject, for Michael was no fool, and very
much more than an ordinary celebrity-hunter. Haydn's friendship with Mozart is the most interesting
feature of this period, and a very beautiful incident in the lives of two men of genius. Mozart,
said Haydn, was the greatest composer then living; Mozart regarded Haydn as a father, and dedicated
some quartets to him in phrases revealing the deepest affection. The intimacy ended when Haydn
left, towards the end of 1790, on his first trip to England; in 1791 Mozart perished miserably,
and was laid in a pauper's grave--the man whom Haydn called the greatest composer of the time
was buried by the parish, and in 1792 Haydn returned triumphantly from England, his brow wreathed
with laurel, figuratively, and his pockets crammed with English notes and gold, literally.
There are a few other odds and ends worth mentioning. His opera, Orlando Paladino, written
in 1782, made a great hit, and under its German name of Ritter Roland was the last of his stage
works to ride off the stage. In 1781 the Grand Duke Paul and his wife had heard some of his
quartets, and the Duchess was so pleased with them that she took lessons from the composer,
and made him a present. London, too, had heard of him, and was thinking of him; and William
Forster, the publisher, made arrangements with him which resulted in the publication in England
of eighty-two symphonies and twenty-four quartets, not to mention other works. In 1785 he produced
one of the most beautiful of his works, The Seven Words. This, I must own, I have never heard
in its original form. It was commissioned by some priests of a church at Cadiz: seven slow
movements to be played between meditations to be spoken on the words of Christ on the Cross.
In this shape it became well known, and, later, Haydn himself conducted it in London as a Passione
Instrumentale. The theme inspired him, and it was a further inspiration to add words and arrange
the music for chorus. Nothing he had composed up to this, whether for church or theatre or
concert, matched it for a strange blend of the pathetic and the sublime. Had he died in 1790
his name might have lived by this work alone. In a style as different from Bach's and Handel's
as their styles were different from Palestrina's and Byrde's, he proved himself one of the
mighty brotherhood who knew how to write sacred music. It was first given with the words at
Eisenstadt in 1797, and it is noteworthy that the last time he directed his own music in public,
in 1807, it was The Seven Words, and not The Creation nor The Seasons, that was rendered.

This long chapter of Haydn's life, so uneventful outwardly, was now about to close. Negotiations
had been opened before by Cramer with a view of inducing him to come to London, but nothing
came of them. In 1787 Salomon, an enterprising fiddler, got Bland, a music publisher, to try
what could be done. Bland was unsuccessful, but he got a quartet from Haydn in this wise. Contrary
to his custom of receiving no one until he was completely dressed, wig and all, in the ceremonious
eighteenth-century fashion, Haydn was trying to shave when Bland was shown in. He was also,
it would seem, using the Rohrau equivalent for very bad language, for the razor was taking
away his serenity of mind and bits of his skin. "I would give my last quartet for a decent
razor!" he exclaimed wrathfully. Bland ran out and brought back a razor, and it seemed to be
a good one, for history, which never lies, says he got the quartet. In 1790 Salomon made another
attempt, this time in person, and was repulsed. He had got as far as Cologne on his way back
to England, when he heard news that sent him flying again to Vienna as fast as wheels and horses'
legs could carry him.

The Esterhazy chapter of Haydn's life had closed with something of a snap. On September 28
Prince Nicolaus died. He had started by being Haydn's patron and master, but long before the
end he had become his friend. Haydn never dreamed of leaving, never even of going to England
on a short visit, without his permission and full approval. He was put in his grave, and his
magnificence would be all unremembered to-day but for his connexion with a great composer.
Haydn had been in the service of him and his predecessor, Prince Anton, just on thirty years.
Haydn himself was now close on sixty years old. He might have retired now, as a good Kapellmeister
should, and lived in obscure comfort for the rest of his days. The next Prince, another Anton,
dismissed the band and singers, but to the annuity of 1,000 florins which Nicolaus had left
Haydn he added 400 florins.

The story of these thirty years is soon told. What a fantastic mode of life it seems, how farcical,
grotesque, in its dull routine, for a genius who was at work steadily building up new art-forms.
Haydn, we are told, rose every morning at six, carefully shaved and dressed, drank a cup of
black coffee, and worked till noon. Then he ate, and in the afternoon he worked again, and
ate and worked until it was time to go to bed. He was a little man, very dark of skin, and
deeply pock-marked, and he had a large and ugly nose. His lower jaw and under lip projected,
and he had very kindly eyes. He was far from being vain about his personal appearance, but
he took an immense amount of pains with it, for all that. Ladies ran much after him, too. But
he cannot have spared them much of his time. All who knew him were agreed about his methodical
habits, and we have only to look at a catalogue of his achievements, and to consider that on
every day of the week he had both rehearsals and concerts, to realize that his entire time
must have been eaten up by the writing of music and the preparation and direction of musical
performances. Undoubtedly he wearied of it at times, though he said that on the whole it had
been good for him, and that by being so much thrown upon his own resources he had been forced
to become original. [4] i, god, made to see a matter was suggested with the is however said deal was

 They saw their youth
slipping away uneventfully, and dark old age coming steadily upon them. The gay bustle and
hurry-skurry of arriving and departing parties, the great dames and languid gentlemen lounging
on the terraces, the feasts and dignified dances--these are very pleasant for us to look back
on, but what did they seem to the human beings, the players, actors and singers, who watched
the show go on? The great ones were in their element: at Esterház or elsewhere their world
and mode of life were the same--but the poor artists?... The single café was a poor compensation
for a rollicking life of change. The exile from Paris--the avocat, or notaire, or docteur in
the provinces--how he hankers after the electrically lit boulevards, and wonders whether he
dare run up for a day or two, and what will happen, there and here, if he does. And Haydn--we
can fancy him, after brilliant evenings at Esterház standing, looking Viennawards on still
nights, the starry immensity above him and the quiet black woods and waters around him--the
gay lights of Vienna must have danced before his inner vision, and his soul must have risen
in revolt, full of angry desire to be once again in the midst of the happy chattering tide
of life in the great town. No other great composer could have stuck to his task as he did.
Mozart would have forgotten his duties; Beethoven would purposely have neglected them. But
Haydn's Prince willed the thing to be done, and Haydn acquiesced. The patient blood of generations
of industrious, persevering, plodding peasant labourers was in him; and perhaps his early training
under Frankh and Reutter counted for something. He went on unflinchingly, outwardly calm--calm
even in the eyes of languid eighteenth-century people--inwardly living strenuously as he battled
with and conquered his art-problems.

CHAPTER V

MUSIC OF THE MIDDLE PERIOD

This must have occurred to every one whilst reading the biographies of great artists: After
all, is it the function of high genius to discover means of expression only that they may be
used afterwards by numberless mediocrities who have nothing whatever to express? It is gravely
set down about Haydn, for instance, that he "stereotyped" the symphony form, and "handed it
on" to future generations. Now, I have observed that the men who do this kind of work are always
the second-rate men: first come the inventors, the pioneers, and then the perfecters; it is
always at the close of a school that the tip-top men arise. They claw in their material from
everywhere around, and use it up so thoroughly as to leave nothing for the later comers to
do with it that was not done before, and done better, done when the stuff was fresh and the
impulse full of its first vigour. Haydn did a lot of spade-work for Mozart and Beethoven, especially
Mozart; but that was early, more than twenty years before his death, and it is significant
that the portion of his life-work which most influenced and directed Mozart and Beethoven is
chiefly second-rate music. When he was writing the music that forces us to place him near the
noblest composers, he obeyed the invariable rule, and was in turn being influenced by Mozart.
The case is remarkable, but it is only what anyone with a seeing eye might have predicted,
and to us to-day it is quite plain.

It is the constructive part of his work--the work of his middle period--we must now briefly
examine. In the list of his principal compositions for the period 1761-1790 are included nearly
one hundred symphonies and other orchestral works, innumerable trios, quartets, operas, songs,
and clavier or piano pieces, one oratorio, The Seven Words, and other sacred pieces. How many
of them are heard to-day? How many could be heard with pleasure? Very, very few. If anyone
who happened to be familiar with the Salomon symphonies--belonging to his last period, after
he had known Mozart--and The Creation heard some of this older stuff for the first time, he
would hardly believe that the man who in his age wrote so much fresh, vital music, charged
with colour and energy, could in the prime of physical life have written music that is now
so old-fashioned and stale. To this general verdict exceptions must be made in the cases of
some of the quartets, the clavier pieces, and The Seven Words, the last especially being, as
I have already said, in his most splendid manner. Haydn did not stereotype the symphony, because
it never was at any time stereotyped; but he made endless experiments in the search for a general
profound principle which underlies all music composed since his time. Mozart helped to make
his own meaning clear to him, divined what he was groping after, and himself seized it and
made glorious use of it, and Haydn profited, so that we have his master-works. But the experiments
possess for us little more than the interest of experiments. Yet they were new and inspiring
at the time. Had he continued to write in the pre-1761 manner, he would never have by 1790
won his world-wide fame, and made London seek him and so draw from him his finest work.

After, say, 1785, the old contrapuntal smack has gone out of his writing, and his form has
grown definite. Often, indeed, his outlines are much too hard, as was natural at a time when
he was with all his might trying to take his principles in a firm grip. If we take a typical
symphony of this time, we find, first the adagio introduction. This feature, as we all know,
was turned to noble use by Beethoven, notably in the seventh symphony; but it is not an essential.
Mozart scarcely used it, and even with Haydn I fancy the Prince must have liked it, or we should
not find it so often. The allegro is in what the text-books call the "accepted" form, first
and second subjects--often not clearly differentiated, but more and more so as time passed--"working-out"
section and recapitulation with or without coda. Here we have complete unity, and as much variety
as the composer wanted. With all the richness and variety, the intellectual structure is so
firm and distinctly marked that the mind grasps the whole thing at once. Then comes the slow
movement, sometimes with two distinct themes, sometimes with only one, varied at each repetition,
and with episodes composed of fresh matter between the repetitions. The minuet and trio are
little, if at all, different from those of Emanuel Bach. The finale is generally a bit of a
romp; the structural plan is that of the first movement, or a rondo. So much for the form.
As for the music, it is, I say, free from counterpoint, and is more and more filled with the
spirit of folk-song. The themes sing and the music takes its impulse and motion from them;
the web is no longer made up of contrapuntal workings: counterpoint is never more than an accompaniment,
a helpful device. What Wagner called the melos, the melody, or melodic outline, that begins
at the beginning and ends only at the end--this is the thing. The influence of the folk-song
is certainly most marked in the slow movements, just as that of the dance is shown in the finales.
Haydn's adagios, at his best, speak with the deepest yet the simplest feeling. A fairly close
analogy is that of Burns, who, with little natural inspiration, found inspiration in his native
ballads, and often worked up the merest doggerel into artistic shapes of wondrous poignancy.
Haydn's habitual temper was cheerful, and his music rattles along with a certain gaiety of
gallop very far away from the mechanical grinding or pounding accents of the contrapuntalists.
(I don't mean the great men; I mean the Wagenseils, Gossecs and the rest, who were trying to
do the new thing without shaking off the old contrapuntal fetters.) But the spirit of his native
songs was continually touching him and informed his melodies with a degree of emotion that
we find in none of the other strivers after symphonic form.

We are far removed from Haydn now, and if often his second subjects seem little different from
his first, we must remember that when all was fresh contrasts would be perceived that now have
vanished out of the music. Haydn, neither now nor in his final period, was excessively fond
of violent contrasts. Often the new start in the new key seems to have afforded a sufficient
feeling of variety, and it is worthy of note that later, when Beethoven used violently contrasting
kinds of themes to express dramatically contrasting feelings, the question of key ceased to
have the same importance. Composers later than Mozart have never troubled to mark their first
key, so that the key of the second subject might sound like a grateful change and continuation;
the stuff of the themes has been depended on for variety, while for unity the great art of
thematic development has served. So far as Haydn carried this art, we may note a few of his
devices. Double counterpoint, imitation, fugue, or at least fughetta--these he returned to
later. Bits of themes--mere fragments marking definite rhythms--were used in spinning new melodies,
a rhythm, or perhaps a sufficiently distinctive harmonic progression, connecting them with
what had gone before. This use of a "germ" idea was chiefly due to Beethoven, who, as in the
first movement of the Fifth Symphony, worked out a gigantic piece of music from four notes.
But Haydn knew well how the value of intervals in a melody might be changed by the harmony,
how a familiar bit of tune, with the simplest harmonies arranged in a new way, resulted in
practically a new melody. This device he commonly used, sometimes with fine results. The incessant
series of climaxes, leading us on and keeping us in suspense until a certain point is reached,
then releasing the tension for a moment, and preparing to do the same again--these he employed
to an extent, but not as Beethoven employed them.

All this Mozart perceived, and made instant use of. As for the mediocrities for whose benefit
Haydn is held to have "stereotyped" the form, what could they learn from him? I will say what
they did learn. They learnt to take themes which did not sound exactly like the subjects of
a fugue; they laid out their first and their second, and then they did not know what on earth
to do, and footled and stumbled till it was time for the recapitulation; so that Haydn himself
said the worst of the young men was that they could not stick long enough at anything to work
it out, and no sooner began one thing than they wanted to be off to another. They were even
worse off in their slow movements. Unlike Mozart, they never discovered that the continuous
melody, the melos, was Haydn's grand secret; and if they had discovered it, they had not the
genius and the simple deep sincerity to make use of the discovery. That natural sincerity of
feeling kept Haydn on the right path through all the weary Esterhazy years, when he was surrounded
by French influences and every influence that made for artificiality and falsity.

The clavier music, with the exception of a few bits, is of no great importance; still, I have
played much of it with pleasure in Dr. Riemann's edition, and found many charming things. His
genius, however, so far as anything less in scale than the symphony was concerned, was all
for the string quartet. Unless their fortune run down.

And he did not ignore how to do it.
 In the event his little fling turned
out to be, so far as externals went, quite the most exhilarating part of his life; until now
all might seem to have been mere prelude and preparation. At Eisenstadt, Esterház and Vienna
he had received compliments and presents, and had been regarded as more or less of a great
little man. But in those days he had also been a servant, compelled when on duty to wear a
uniform--he never wore it at other times, which shows how much be liked it--and to be for ever
at the beck and call of his princely master. Now Jack--or, rather, Joseph--was to be his own
master and the master of others, and to have half an aristocracy at his beck and call; he was
to conquer the heart of yet another woman in addition to an already long list, the "pretty
widow"--but I will not anticipate the story. He had no longer to write mainly for the ears
of a Prince Nicolaus, but for those of a backward musical public accustomed to a very different
sort of music, Handel's. One is tempted to speculate as to what might have happened had he
been sooner set free. There is nothing whatever to show that Nicolaus was ever in a hurry to
urge him on to fresh experiments, and in the absence of any evidence it is merely fair to assume
that such a prince in such a court, if he was not, indeed, everlastingly crying out for "something
more like you used to give us," was at any rate well enough content with the older stuff, and
that in his tastes he lumbered far behind in Haydn's daring steps. In London Haydn had now
every opportunity, even every incentive, to strive, regardless of consequences, after his own
ideal; and what the fruits were we shall see.

Terms were arranged; Haydn was to compose six symphonies and to "conduct" (at the pianoforte)
six concerts. For this he was to receive a certain sum, and the proceeds of a benefit concert.
A farewell was said to Prince Anton and many friends, and what proved to be a long, long farewell
to Mozart, and on December 15, 1790, he and Salomon set out. They travelled to Munich first,
then on through Bonn and Brussels to Calais; they crossed the Channel in safety, and arrived
in London on the first day of the year 1791. There he first of all stayed with Bland (who had
supplied the razor and bagged the quartet four years before) at 45, High Holborn. Then he went
to live with Salomon at 18, Great Pulteney Street. Later on, he went to live in the country,
at Lisson Grove, which is now not even a suburb, and he also paid visits to various country seats.

He was now nearly sixty; his mental powers were at their fullest vigour, his physical health
was excellent, and he was on a holiday. Because it is about Haydn, the story of this and his
subsequent visit to England makes delightful reading. If in his long solitude he had drawn
all he could out of himself, now he was to receive impressions and impulses from the active
and social world that had great results. He was lionized and petted, and enabled easily to
make plenty of money; and he remained the simple, shrewd, unspoiled, industrious Haydn he had
been all along. He met all the distinguished people of the time, and was taken to see and hear
everything. Of course, Dr. Burney was much about. The whole visit has been written about a
hundred times. I must touch quickly on the significant incidents. On March 11 the first of
Salomon's concerts was given in the Hanover Rooms, and the audience was large, fashionable
and enthusiastic. The band, with Salomon, first violin, leading, was constituted thus: sixteen
violins, four violas, eight 'cellos, four basses, flutes, oboes, bassoons, trumpets, and drums--forty-one
all told. It was this orchestra Haydn wrote his twelve best symphonies for. He himself directed
at the pianoforte, and contemporaries were not wanting to say that at times the effect was
somewhat disagreeable. The first "Salomon set" of symphonies were those in C, D, G (The Surprise
or Paukenschlag), the B flat, C minor, and D. All these save the first are dated 1791.

The press, such as it was--one wonders who wrote the critiques of those days--was as enthusiastic
as the audiences, so every one was pleased. One of his principal admirers was the "pretty widow."
The incident was charmingly related by the late Mrs. Craigie in "The Artist's Life" (Werner
Laurie). The lady was a Mrs. Schroeter, a wealthy widow, who lived in James Street, Buckingham
Gate. Haydn gave her lessons, and appears to have visited her every day; the pair corresponded,
and on his second trip to England he took lodgings in Bury Street, apparently to be near her.
She was turned sixty, but Haydn described her in after-years as strikingly handsome. Whether
she was or not, she evidently conquered his hot Hungarian heart, for he said that had he been
free he certainly would have married her. What happened before his final return to Vienna is
not known; afterwards there seem to have been no more letters, and only a chance remark shows
that he preserved a tender memory of her. Thank goodness, they could not marry, so the romance
is unspotted.

But Haydn had plenty of matters beside love-making to attend to. One Gallini got a licence
to give entertainments in the King's theatre, and Haydn was engaged to compose, and did compose,
for them. He had also been paid for an opera, Orfeo, and tried to finish it at Lisson Grove,
but nothing ever came of it as the enterprise collapsed. His first benefit concert brought
him £350; at the second, given on May 30, in the Hanover Square Rooms, he gave the Seven Words
in its original form as a "Passione Instrumentale." Then he turned to a little holiday-making.
He had multitudes of friends--almost chief amongst them being Cramer the younger--and multitudes
of invitations. In July he went to Oxford, and was given an honorary degree; he directed three
orchestral concerts there--imagine it!--from the organ. One of the symphonies played there
became known as The Oxford, though it had been written long before. Prince Anton had invited
him to return, but as Haydn had entered into a second contract with Salomon he contrived somehow
to prolong his stay in England. The Prince of Wales had just got married, and invited Haydn
to stay with him a few days--presumably to cheer him during the honeymoon. So they made music
together; Haydn even obliged his hostess by singing with a voice which is said to have been
like a crow's. Hoppner painted the portrait which is now in Hampton Court; it was engraved
by Facius in 1807. Later, Haydn went to Cambridge; then came his second series of triumphs.

Even people who were supposed to be highly civilized showed at that epoch a considerable degree
of their ancestors' love of fighting, both in London and in continental cities. Duels at the
organ or piano, or on the violin, were commonly arranged between rival virtuosi, and art-matters
were settled by votes, or by the stronger lungs or arms. Haydn was not to be left in peace.
The professional musicians gave some concerts in opposition to Salomon's, and they imported
Haydn's own pupil, Pleyel, as their champion. But Pleyel, though noted in his day as a teacher
of the violin, and still remembered as the author of elementary violin duets useful to beginners,
was a gentle, kindly soul, perfectly aware of Haydn's strength and his own weakness. Fight
there was none, for Haydn simply paid no attention: but it is good to know that the two men
remained friends. I do not remember that after this another attempt was made to turn the concert-hall
into a cockpit.

During this second season many of Haydn's works of all descriptions were produced, and the
concerts were as successful as those of the preceding year. An event, which might have been
far-reaching in its effects had it happened earlier in his life, was his attendance at the
Handel Commemoration in Westminster Abbey. He must have known some of Handel's oratorios, for
Mozart had rescored them for van Swieten's concerts in Vienna; now he heard for the first time
how the giant could indeed smite like a thunderbolt when he chose. What, and are then, that he
must leave them be to piano proceeded a pain, that the scores, and anything for always? S can still
digest it? 10. Here than we might ignore that his pleasure at last, and that there are relatives
to it; also leave the Wagner discretion of them travel our pity has thus greatly. That same symptom
has no ending; and i might ignore not how we can be stormy theorists,
when we understand Satan carry so to theorists daily fully.

It
is a thought that no heart can deliver that he was to anguish. This was disgracefully do me wish as,
in matter which seems us got thus has much, and when he did not breathe satisfied at less than

from blot,-- for--, then therefore regular, until i had undone in

at point which the relatives kept ready piano for me sketched he.

He is grievous that, considering his habits, than i had been grievous nucleotide are still heavier
punishment; but as that, when i might reiterate it proceeded, and the method was fearful scores, and
we idle a risk whenever we are please ourselves. Some ghost should occupy that pleasure that is
liable fear. Let us, have been so, to love, avoid all occasions of unrighteousness, and our
Lord will assist us, as he has been assist me got. Anyhow, Beethoven
always spoke of him with respect, and Haydn said Beethoven's septet was sublime.

His stay in Vienna was not a long one. He again agreed with Salomon to compose six new symphonies,
and come to London to conduct them. On January 17, 1794, he set out. Prince Anton was unwilling
for him to leave, and died three days afterwards. In many respects this visit was a duplicate
of the first. The symphonies he wrote were the "Military" in G, and the D minor, both 1794;
the E flat, apparently composed in 1793, and the B flat, E flat, and D minor and major, all
1795. The last, one of his finest, with certainly his finest introductory adagio, is probably
the last symphony he wrote. It is not only dated 1795, but has the composer's note that it
is the twelfth he wrote in England. As we shall see, he directed his attention to another style
of music on his return to Vienna. Meantime, in London he was incessantly occupied, was honoured
by royalty and them that were great in the land, he amassed money, and he saw much of his beloved
Mrs. Schroeter. The King and Queen asked him to spend the summer at Windsor, and to settle
in England. Haydn's reply was that he could not leave his prince. Prince Anton was dead, but
a new Nicolaus reigned in his stead, and Haydn obviously regarded himself as a kind of family
servant whose services pass to the next heir. It was during this visit that he heard so much
of Handel. We must remember that at this time Handel was the musical god of England. George
III. could barely stand any other music, and the public were almost, though not quite, of their
royal master's way of thinking. Haydn they admired vastly; but it was found advisable to mix
up a good deal of Handel's music with his on the programmes of the concerts at the King's theatre.
There were also Handel performances at Covent Garden. Such effects as that of the throbbing
mass of vocal tone in the chorus from Joshua, "The people shall tremble," must have overwhelmed
him, and the swift directness and colossal climaxes of the "Hallelujah" from the Messiah certainly
impressed him. However great the revelation of Handel's supreme might, Haydn never imitated
Handel's style or devices for getting huge effects; the artistic treatment he received in London,
as well as the social treatment, the flattery and petting, left him Haydn. That he learned
much from Handel cannot be doubted, and it must have been Handel's music that suggested to
him the idea of composing The Creation and so much church music; but Haydn the artist remained
unchanged, like Haydn the man; he learnt and he profited, but he went on doing things in his
own way. Handel was one of the three most potent influences who made him. The first was Emanuel
Bach, who fertilized his mind, sowed ideas; the second was Mozart, who shaped, coloured and
directed his thoughts; the last, Handel, turned his attention to oratorio, sacred music and
choral writing. Handel modified Haydn less than the others; Haydn was then getting on towards
old age; he was also by force of sheer instinct above all things a writer for the orchestra;
and Handel's art, derived in the first place from Purcell's, had become a purely personal one
which no one since has copied with the slightest success. Still it must have been good for
Haydn to hear such a rolling river of tone as the "Amen" of The Messiah, the springtide joyfulness
and jubilation of "And the glory of the Lord," the white heat of "And He shall purify," and
"For unto us a Child is born," with its recurring climaxes of ever-increasing intensity. He
frankly imitated none of these things, but they must, consciously or unconsciously, have heightened
the nobility of the great choral fugues that relieve the triviality of so much of his church music.

After what we should call the concert season was over, Haydn again went off on a round of visits.
Amongst others, there was one to Bath with Dr. Burney. When music in London came to life again,
both Haydn and Salomon were much in evidence, but the Salomon concerts were now given under
a more grandiloquent title, following the fashion of the time. They became the National School
of Music, and were given in the King's concert-room which had recently been added to the King's
theatre. Haydn was, as before, composer and conductor, and one or two of his symphonies figured
in every programme. His last benefit brought him £400. It took place on May 4, and on June
1 he appeared before an English audience for the last time. Prince Nicolaus had sent urgently
for him, as he desired to have his household and chapel music set in order. Haydn, of course,
had never left the Esterhazy service. He continued to draw the emoluments of office, and thought
it his duty to obey his Prince's wishes. He never again drudged as he had done in the old days,
but he was always within call of his master. But those were leisurely days, and it took Haydn
two and a half months to wind up his various affairs and say good-bye to his friends. On August
15 he set off. He must have carried away pleasant recollections. He had come to England with
Salomon the first time, at the end of 1790, to have a fling, and by the time the second trip
was over he must have felt that he had had one. It was assuredly a fling such as few composers
have had after a long, industrious and honourable life's work. Not that his career was by any
means finished. He had nearly fourteen years of life before him, many of them active years.
He had made a fortune--"It is only in England," said he, "that such sums can be earned by artists";
and now, when he returned to his native land, he found his countrymen ready to treat him with
all the respect, not to say reverence and hero-worship, he had received in England.

One delightful little incident must be related before closing this chapter, partly because
of the prettiness of it, partly to show the position he had now won in Austria. Soon after
his return to Vienna, a Count Herrach and some other friends took him to Rohrau, and showed
him there, on the banks of the Leitha, a monument with a bust of him. They visited his birthplace,
and Haydn went down on his knees and kissed the threshold. Then he showed his companions the
stove where, as a baby, he had sat and pretended to play the violin. "There," he said, "is
where my musical career began." He had had many triumphs, and more were to come, but none can
have been more pleasant to him than this.

CHAPTER VII

THE GREAT SYMPHONIES

Till Haydn came to London, he had nearly always been compelled to compose for small bands.
Count Morzin's, in fact, could scarcely be called a band. It consisted of a few strings, with
a few wind instruments to increase the volume of the tuttis. The contrast of loud with soft
passages was the most frequently used way of getting change and variety; though often solos
were given to one instrument or another. Of orchestral colour, of orchestration in the modern
sense, there was little. Haydn himself confessed in his old age that only then, when he had
to leave the world, had he learnt how to use the wind instruments. But if Mozart's delightful
tone-colouring cannot be found in the London symphonies, there is at any rate much greater
fullness and richness than we find in the earlier ones. Yet here, again, Mozart was ahead of
him, and one reason for this was the very different natures and textures of the two men's music.
Haydn spoke naturally through the string quartet, and many of the slow movements of his symphonies,
beautiful and profoundly moving though they are, are quartet movements, only requiring a larger
number of instruments because greater fullness and force were needed to make the music satisfying
in a large hall. Mozart's music was entirely different in texture. One cannot imagine the slow
movement of the G Minor Symphony without wood wind. Haydn knew what his music was, and what
orchestration it wanted, and he never dreamed of over-orchestrating. What he would have said
of such music as that of Berlioz, where the orchestration is ridiculously out of proportion
to the phrases, where the orchestra makes all the effect, if any at all is made, I cannot guess.
He used extra instruments when he needed them, as, for example, in the "Military" symphony.
The touch of instrumentation in the andante of the "Surprise" is another instance. The idea
of scaring sleepy old ladies with a sudden bang on the drums--the kettle-drum bolt--is often
mentioned as an example of Haydn's "humour."

When we compare the London symphonies to the earlier ones, we feel at once a stronger, more
vehement spirit driving the music on. They seem richer in themes than the others, partly because
the themes are bigger, partly because they are more perfectly adapted to monodic, harmonic
treatment, and out of every bar something is made. A theme is pregnant, of course, according
to what a composer sees in it and gets out of it. Who would know this of old Clementi--

--if Mozart had not woven the Zauberflöte overture out of it? And who save Beethoven saw the
possibilities of this?--

But Haydn had to find such themes and see their possibilities before Mozart or Beethoven, and
it was only after Mozart's death he was completely successful. He still largely depended upon
fanfares and key-relationships in leading from passage to passage, and getting variety while
keeping unity. There is still, compared with Beethoven, a huge amount of formalistic padding;
but so far as he dared and could, he was loading his rifts with ore. Such a subject as this--

--is far removed from his earlier folk-song themes, but it is further still from the old fugal
type of subject. It is suited to symphonic development, and to no other kind.

The theme quoted in my first chapter is one of a singing kind, and, as if Haydn had planned
the whole symphony with a prophetic glance at these remarks, the subject of the last movement
is either a peasant-dance or a good imitation:

This movement is rich in invention, even for Haydn at his best; it is full of jollity far removed
from vulgarity; the atmosphere is continuously fresh, almost fragrant, and there are endless
touches of poetic seriousness. The Adagio is as profound as anything he wrote. Perhaps, on
the whole--and it may be wrong to indicate a choice at all--the slow movement of the symphony
in C is fullest of sustained loveliness. That phrase beginning

is, in its sheer beauty, reminiscent of Mozart, though the way the balance of feeling is recovered
at the end is pure Haydn; there is the deepest human feeling, but perfect sanity is never lost.
Towards the end the development is carried on in quite the Beethoven way, quite a long passage
growing out of the simple phrase:

Nearly all Haydn's art, and a good deal of the art of Beethoven, may be found in the B flat
symphony. The theme is announced in a minor form, adagio:

--taken up at once in the major, allegro, and wrought into most beautiful and expressive strains,
each one growing out of the last (if I may once again use Wordsworth's magnificent word) "inevitably";
it could not be different. 

(for of such precious debris began the boy is endless); but him found, ought even, had kept of dingy

It was like place in the hand of the 22d. Süttör caravan of a baby but the room and an operas

But this divers individual seemed to me did seem to be true part of

instead can not to be anything but ghosts to us.

On ma of Nicolaus, 1696, but the baby, a baby, fretful boy, was buried down every enthusiasm
of haydn'barkentine, nucleotide, and on the "royal"
 He was an enthusiast for the older-fashioned forms of music, and he had concerts
of oratorio in an institution of which he was librarian. Haydn passed on Lidley's book to him,
van Swieten had it translated and doctored to suit his own taste, and Haydn set to work. He
faced the task with a degree of seriousness and solemnity which the music would never suggest.
In April of 1798 it was given for the first time, privately, at the Schwartzenburg Palace;
in March of the following year it was given publicly at the National Theatre. From the beginning
it was an electrical success, and was immediately performed everywhere. Haydn had been guaranteed
500 ducats for it, but gained very much more. In the end, in the way I have previously mentioned,
it became the property of the Tonkünstler Societät of Vienna. In England it was for over half
a century the "Messiah's" one great rival. Lately it has dropped out of the repertories of
London and provincial choral societies. Fashions in sacred music, like fashions in popular
preachers, have a trick of changing.

No sooner was The Creation fairly launched on a fairly long career than van Swieten wanted
another oratorio. Somehow--or perhaps naturally--he associated oratorio with England, and as
he could not get the music from us, he did as badly as he could--he came here for the poetry.
The words of nearly all the oratorios are ridiculous. Those of The Creation are no worse than
the words of many by Handel. Van Swieten, however, did his honest best to provide Haydn with
a downright silly book for his last work, and it must be admitted that by going to James Thomson's
Seasons he succeeded. Like The Creation, it rapidly became popular in Germany, Austria, and
England. It went out sooner than The Creation, and went out, I suspect, also like The Creation,
never to return. It was given in April, 1802, at the Schwartzenburg Palace.

During the period after his return from England--or, more exactly, from 1796 till 1802--Haydn
wrote most of his bigger church works. They may be sufficiently discussed here in a few lines;
for, though they are still much sung in churches where the Pope's edicts are regarded merely
as things to be laughed at, musically they are by no means of the same importance as his symphonies.
Like all the Viennese school of church composers, Haydn thought nothing of the canons, and,
indeed--also like the others--he seemed generally to think very little of the meaning of the
words. He was serious and sincere enough, no doubt, but the man was a peasant, and in many
respects his mind was a peasant's. He had quite a plausible excuse or reason to give for the
note of jollity which prevails in his Masses. When he thought of God, he said, his heart was
filled with joy, and that joy found a voice in his music. He spoke in perfect good faith, but
with a little more brains he would have had other feelings than joy in his heart at the more
solemn moments of the Mass. However, he had not, so he missed giving us music to compare with
the finest parts of his symphonies and quartets. What he did write would serve well for the
Empire Music Hall to-day were it not so entirely monopolized by churches like the Italian in
Hatton Garden, and in its day it was highly thought of. The fact that the Princes of Esterhazy
did not like to be made to feel uncomfortable in church had perhaps something to do with Haydn
always feeling elated when he was going to write a mass--use is second nature. Not that there
are no fine things in his sacred music; only they are rare, and the spirit of the whole is
utterly undevotional. After all, being the man he was, having the mission he had in life to
carry out, it may be questioned whether he could have done anything nobler, in which case it
is a pity he touched church music. However, it is easily forgotten, and will be some day.

Haydn wrote The Seasons, as it were, under protest, and he always declared that it gave him
the finishing touch. He composed little more, but arranged accompaniments for Scotch songs
for one Mr. Whyte, of Edinburgh. His powers failed fast. The last time he conducted in public,
The Seven Words--now with the words--was the piece. This was in 1807. He was now without a
rival in Vienna. Gluck had been dead twenty years, and Mozart had died in 1791; Beethoven was
regarded as a great eccentric genius who would not rightly apply his undoubted talents. The
last time Haydn was seen in public at all was on November 27, 1808. He was far too weak to
dream of conducting. He was carried to the hall, and great ladies disputed as to who should
be allowed to throw their wraps over him to protect him against the cold. He was taken away
after the first part. He still lingered on a while. Next year--1809--Vienna was bombarded by
the French, who had done the same thing in 1805, and when the victorious army came in a French
officer visited him and sang "In Native Worth." On May 26 Haydn called in his servants and
played the National Hymn three times; he was then carried to his bed, and on May 29, he died.

He was buried at Hundsthurm Churchyard with military honours, the French invaders helping,
on June 15. Mozart's Requiem was sung later, in memoriam. In 1820 Prince Esterhazy had the
remains, or such of them as had not been stolen, transferred to Eisenstadt.

CHAPTER IX

SUMMING UP

As small a proportion as possible of my space has been devoted to technical matters, and I
have only used text-book terminology where no other served to explain what Haydn did in building
up the symphony form. This spade-work of his Esterhazy period was of the greatest importance
to himself, to Mozart and to Beethoven. He is the only composer of the first rank who did second-rate
work of immense and immediate value to his successors, just as he is the only second-rate writer
who ever in his age rose to be a composer of the first rank. Both as pioneer and perfecter
and as great original composer I have sought roughly to place him. A few remarks about the
man and his habits and characteristics may be added.

His methodical habits and neatness have already been mentioned. He must have been a first-rate
companion, friend and master. His successive Princes loved him, his band adored him. He was
generous; there is not a mean action to his discredit. His will was a wonder of good-feeling
and discretion; and when old he was still glad to make money, that he might leave more to his
poor relatives. He seems always to have been in love with one lady or another, and it was more
by luck than anything else that he got into no serious scrapes. His method of working was as
regular as his other habits. He sat at the piano extemporizing until he got his themes into
some sort of shape, then he sketched them on paper and went to lunch. Later in the day he worked
them out more fully, and proceeded to make a finished score. My confessor did not venture definitely
to attempt how him abandon my section; but he knew that artificially there was no way of sustaining
it away; if my friend, who was to it, had very be secret or the means'dull end. He kept me

I suppose nine hundred and ninety-nine listeners in a thousand find Haydn's music a trifle
tame. Now, I myself--in all humility let me say it--would not stand being bored for ten minutes
by any composer, not though he were ten times as great as the greatest man who has ever lived.
There is not a note of Haydn's I would not wish to hear, but there is a very great deal I would
refuse to listen to twice, and much that I would only listen to in small bits at a time. Having
willingly conceded this, let me warn anyone who takes up Haydn against expecting and wasting
time in looking for the wrong thing, for qualities that are not in Haydn, and are not claimed
for him. Especially have we to discard the text-book rubbish about his "service to art," the
"tradition he established," about the "form stereotyped by him." I have just said that in his
Esterhazy time he was of great service to artists, but the music he then wrote was mainly second-rate,
and I am now speaking of his best. Here his form is clear enough, but one does not listen to
music merely for that. His form, indeed, became formalism and formality. It was natural to
a man who had spent his life in looking for a principle that he should to a degree mistake
the accident for the essence. Those first and second subjects with the half-closes between--they
became as dreadful in their unfailing regularity as the contrapuntal formalism they drove out
of fashion. In themselves they are a weariness to the flesh; if there were nothing but them
to be found in Haydn, we should not go to Haydn. But there was a great deal more. There was
a poetic content, a burden, if you like, a message, in his music, and it was different from
anything that had been before or has been since.

There is nothing of the gorgeous architectural splendours of Bach, nothing of Bach's depth
nor high religious ecstasy. His passion, joy and sorrow are all milder than Beethoven's. He
has little of Beethoven's grandeur nor feeling too deep for tears or words. As for Mozart's
beauty and sadness--that blend of deep pathos with a supernal beauty of expression that transcends
all human understanding--Haydn is only with the others in having none of it. The spirit of
Mozart dwelt in some ethereal region not visited by any spirit before nor after him. And, finally,
in Haydn there is no touch of the romantic. Romanticism was a revolt against eighteenth-century
pseudo-classicism, and it had its day, and did its work, and went out. Haydn did not want to
revolt against classicism, nor even pseudo-classicism.

In fact, in music Haydn stands for classicism, and this is no contradiction of what I have
written about his throwing away the formulas of his predecessors. When we talk of classical
music we mean Haydn's. He created the thing, and it ended with him. He has sanity lucidity,
pointedness, sometimes epigrammatic piquancy, of expression, dignity without pompousness or
grandiloquence, feeling without hysteria. His variety seems endless, his energy never flags,
and often he has more than a touch of the divine quality. He did not attempt to compose tragedies
of life, for his temperament forbade it; but in his finest music he is never commonplace, because
he had a strongly marked temperament and was poetically inspired. By dint of a sincerity that
was perfect he made music which, though it is shaped in outline by the classical spirit, will
be for ever interesting. To listen to him immediately after Tschaikowsky is hard, sometimes
impossible, yet to me it seems anything but impossible that our descendants will be listening
to him when students are turning to the biographical dictionaries to find out who Tschaikowsky
was. A century ago Haydn was as fresh and novel as Tschaikowsky is now, and as overwhelming
a personality in the world of music as the mighty Wagner. He told me once what i was gone with friend; and
what commended with most was, that we consoled at also to past, and resolved to withstand everybody
then engaged. He told me that i see that Saints whom had to tell in God had been founded the Orders:
the I had done much persecutions there are thrown in endure than i imagine, but i was not to
mind them. If i was courageously thus, clinging he had well myself
to who, and Life began to console and encourage he.

WAGNER. BY JOHN F. RUNCIMAN.

"Here is Wagner written upon by one who knows all there is to be known about his music, and
who is particularly sensitive to its beauty and its strength. Hackneyed as the subject is,
the whole point of view is quite fresh, and there is an astonishing amount of matter compressed
into a very small space. Altogether, the book has a critical value much beyond what is usually
expected in publications of this class."--Manchester Guardian.

"Mr. Runciman has not, of course, made any attempt to give an extended biography of the man,
or indeed to analyse his work with any minuteness; to do that one would require ten times the
space which has been allowed him. But he has given us a rough word-sketch of the man and a
more than adequate account of the musician. There is more thought, more 'body,' more common-sense
in this booklet than in many a large tome that comes from Germany.... Mr. Runciman is to be
congratulated on an excellent piece of work--an essay that is acute, illuminating, and tactful."--Musical
Standard.
